       Katy:   Master fucked my ass tonight.  I had thirty minutes to prepare before I was to call Master.  I started by inserting a rabbit vibrator in my pussy backwards, with the rabbit part vibrating against my anus.  We've had trouble with anal play before.  I have a very sensitive ass, and have had to call a halt to anal play in the past, but using the vibrator first helped a lot.  After I felt the anal sphincters were relaxed enough, I inserted the medium butt plug and put a red velvet thong on over it to hold it in.  These two innovations--using the vibrator before insertion and the thong after--made a huge difference.  This was definitely the most fun anal play I've had in long distance.  After I was prepared, I called Master.  I had to confess that I had had an orgasm without his permission, and I hadn't tried very hard to stop it.  He ordered me to pinch my clit as punishment.  He asked me if I thought that was enough punishment.  I didn't think it was.  The second pinch was much harder, and I felt the combination was appropriate punishment.  Master might have punished me more for his own pleasure, except that he is always careful on work nights not to do anything that might leave residual soreness in the morning.  (We learned that lesson once when I was using nipple clamps while we were on the phone.  Since I'm not experienced in their use, I ended up with very sore nipples the next day.  We since decided that nipple clamps will only be for Master to use on me when he is physically here.)  Playtime was very raw and erotic.  Master wove a fantasy on the phone, directed my play with the vibrators, called me his slavegirl, made me beg to cum.  My favorite part was when Master had me count down from ten to one to reach orgasm.  I counted slowly, and in between numbers, he told me I was his fucktoy, that he loved me, that I was his property, that he was going to cum in my slut mouth.    A bubble bath followed the play.  Safety is important.  All of the toys get washed and disinfected after any play--not just anal play--but normally I wait until the next morning to shower.  But after anal play, I prefer to bathe immediately and make sure no germs get transferred to the vagina or urethra.  And since I had the cordless phone, I was able to talk to Master while I soaked and relaxed.  Pure bliss.

       Master:   Very early on I decided to see if Katy could be trained to orgasm on command.  She could.  And, no, she isn't faking it, trust me.  What, you want details?  It has to do with my command voice and Katy's desire to be a good girl.  It is possible it also has something to do with her desire to have 97 orgasms a day.  The first time we touched, in the international arrivals area at Washington's Dulles International Airport, I said "Cum now!" in her right ear as we hugged.  She did.  I had to hold her up.  Now, she can orgasm from reading the words.  How does it make me feel?  Does any (non-gay) male reading this want to try telling me that he would not like the ability to make his mate orgasm on command?  The ability feeds my dominant energy (that would be an understatement) and is one of the things that reinforces the dynamic of our relationship.

       Katy:    Engraving Day   When Master first emailed me a picture of the collar, he told me that we would have it engraved and that I would hand the collar to the engraver and tell him what would be engraved on it.  I accepted this without question at the time--I think I was too overcome at the thought of the collar to attend to such faraway details.  Later I bought Master a silver keyring.  It was weeks before we decided what would be engraved upon them.  The plans that day were a movie first and then we would have the collar engraved.  But the movie was sold out, so I had to mentally change gears.  That's when I realized that I was very very nervous about doing it.  As we walked into the mall, I asked Master the question I had forgotten to ask earlier:  Why do I have to be the one to hand the collar over?  Master explained that it was a way for him to know that I had truly accepted the commitment I was making to the nature of our relationship.  I think.  The whole experience is a bit of a blur.  Whatever he said, it was enough to convince me that it was something real and not just a scene for us.    The engraver wasn't at the kiosk.  We hovered about, looking at the various engravable items for sale and choosing a typeface.  When he appeared and asked what we wanted, I handed over the bag with the collar and said "I'd like to have this engraved."  I don't think my voice shook.  Master answered questions about the typeface and positioning and capitalization.  It took a long time for the engraver to set up the machine, because of the collar having the chrome layer over leather.  I wandered off and got us smoothies.  After the collar was finished and Master paid for it, I was tempted to hurry off.  But my dog needed a new tag, so I had one made.  It occured to me that the man might think the dog tag was meant to go with the collar.  *picturing a "Lost Sub" poster up on a telephone pole*  ggg  Finally I had Master's keyring engraved to match the collar.    Now that Master and I are apart again, I don't wear this collar.  I don't want to handle the key--that is for Master.  Sometimes I take it out of the drawer and look at it or touch it.  I look at the pictures of me wearing it.  I can summon in an instant the way it felt the first time he closed it around my throat.  The way it felt every time he did.  I don't want to dilute the power of this collar by wearing it when he is not here.  Most days I wear the heavy chain he gave me.  Occasionally I wear a pretty leather and chain one.  I love you Master.  Thank you for collaring me.

       Katy's most personal collar  The collar is a leather choker with a wide chrome strip attached to it.  Attached to that are three 'D' rings and the locking mechanism.  The main reason this collar has so far only been worn in private is that Katy turns into a puddle of mush once it's on.  The 'D' rings are used to attach her leash and/or wrist restraints to.

       Master:  Terminal Cuteness?   It seems that I am terminally cute.  Several submissives I have known have called me that.  One even called one of my early BDSM fantasy stories "wholesome".  Katy's Mother has labelled me "cute" -- not helped, I suspect, by my referring to her as "Mumsie" in my English accent.  Now, a FemDom who's judgement I trust has labelled Katy and me as "cute cute cute".  As she says: you cannot be an exhibitionist ("Moi?" he said, pretentiously) and hide the truth.  Ah well.

       Master:   Katy's most personal collar has an interesting story behind it.  I had it custom made by a leather working friend in England.  I told Katy that we would go somewhere and have it engraved, and that she would talk with the engraver and explain what we wanted on it - we chose "One".  I chose to make Katy do this, because I want her to get used to what it means to be in a 24/7 BDSM relationship.  She wants this, but has never experienced it before.  I was careful to choose a location where the chances of her being seen by anbody she knows were cery small.  Also, it took our dynamic out into a public space - a first for Katy.  The engravers was in one of those open stres in the middle of a large mall.  I could see that Katy was nervous, and even a little embarrassed when she spoke with the nice man running the stall.  She was doing really well, right up to the point where he said something like "This is a nice collar.  I've never seen one like this before."  Katy turned a very particular shade of deep red.  When he then said "Have you got matching cuffs to go with it?", and I answered "Not yet.", she went even redder.  I held her, stroked her unobtrusively and supported her.  Katy has orders to post her feelings about the event later today.

       Katy:   The collaring ritual Master describes  urlLink below  came about as a direct result of our  urlLink first fight.   Not only is it a beautiful ritual to affirm our bond to one another, it also serves a practical purpose of making a clear boundary between subspace and publicspace.    Master has given me three collars.  One is a decorative leather collar with a chain waterfall.  It is beautiful, but not for day to day wear.  One is a very personal collar, and I don't put it on myself when we are apart, though I sometimes stroke it or look at it.  I will write more about this collar soon.  The collar I wear every day is a chrome chain with a padlock.  I love the feel of its weight around my neck.    When I put my fingers up and touch it, I can feel Master beside me.

       Katy:   Very early in our relationship, Master trained me to orgasm on command, which is effective perhaps 95% of the time.  When I hear his command voice saying the words "Cum now!", I have a sharp, tight climax through my body, centered just below my ribs.  It doesn't even have to be his voice.  He can also do it by email.  And of course in person, the effect is even greater.  Don't tell Master, but I'm pretty sure I got the better end of the deal.

       Beast:   We started a daily ritual recently.  When Katy gets home from the office she calls me and I collar her over the phone.  In the morning, I call her to wake her and de-collar her for the day.  At the weekend, she only removes the collar to shower.  This simple sounding ritual reinforces the dynamic of our relationship -- for both of us.  Even though we both know that the collar is always around her pretty throat, even when it isn't.  My little slut is a very beautiful woman - her beauty increases by a factor of approximately three million when she is collared.

       Beast:   Journal Entry 2/26/03  I started a hand-written journal a couple of weeks ago.  It's been superseded by this blog.  I'm going to transcribe a few of the journal entries.  The purpose (or one of them), of this blog, is to explore the day-to-day process of being in a 24/7 BDSM relationship.  You'll see us, warts and all.  You have been warned.  The PDoc just changed Katy's meds because the Paxil stopped working for her.  She/we went through an awful 24 hours where she felt as though her senses were dulled.  This was the first time I have seen this symptom of her condition.  It worried Daddy because, unlike the other BadStuff, it felt as though there was nothing I could do to help.  Katy explained (and I believe her) that I was helping just by being there.  That helped a little, but only a little.  Why?  Because Daddy wants to fix things -- doing something practical to help make things better.  Katy has a minor demon that tells her I will eventually tire of taking care of her.  This, of course, is a load of foetid dingo's kidneys.  I expect this demon is feeding off the fact that I left my last previous partner just as she became ill.  The circumstances were, of course, very different.  I didn't leave that relationship  because  she was ill, but rather  despite  her illness.  Guilt over that, and other things, kept me there at least a year longer than I should have been.  The terrible ache caused by Katy and I being 3,600 miles apart just won't go away.  It isn't just the kinky sex I miss, although ___________ (insert name of favoured deity here) knows I miss that.  It is the companionship, the togetherness, intimacy etc. in 3D.  The absolute proof that what we have is both real and really does feel like a soulmate thing.  I love Katy with all my heart and soul.  I still can't quite purge the strange feeling caused by Katy's Mother (only a few years older than me - I am in my early 40s) declaring me to be "cute".    Journal Entry 2/27/03   Following the helpful suggestion of a kinky friend (femsub, if it matters). I will soon have Katy visit her local Home Depot and make a list of all those things that she can think of a kinky use for.  Hint for all new kinksters: your local Home Depot (or other big hardware store) is your friend - much cheaper than kinky stores.  Max insists that she won't be able to get past the chains (she has a serious chain fetish).  I helpfully explained (Helpful Doms 'r' Us) that of course she will be able to - she will be ordered to.  She had to admit that I had a point there.  I screwed up today.  I pointed out to Katy that she hadn't called me "Master" (shortened to "M" when at work) for some three hours.  Katy is having a real problem with the "Master" thing.  She wants to use it, but often forgets.  I relax Da Roolz and she can forget to use it completely if she is busy.  It doesn't help that she has a "not good enough" demon from her childhood, that has a (gradually weakening) hold over her.  UPDATE: We seem to have found a balance, as of early March.   Journal entry 3/4/03  Last night was interesting -- we had our first fight.  I screwed up and didn't call her back from subspace after we'd played on the 'phone.  In my slight defence, she was laughing and joking with me afterwards and I thought she had come back on her own.  My mistake.  She got quite pissed off with me and she was right to - I made a bad mistake, but shit happens.  I am very proud of her.  Why?  Because she has spent years with people who avoid confrontation like the plague.  She learnt, partly as a defence mechanism, to bottle things up.  Not healthy.  I like to pile in and work things through as they happen.  Katy, for possibly the first time in her life, was able to let out her anger and have the fight.  We worked it through, and are stronger because of it.

      As a child,  urlLink Beauty and the Beast  was my favorite fairy tale.  I read every version of it I could find.  I'm delighted to find this version by j.m. kearns.  The narrator is a little preachy, but then there are lines like this:    That night Belle dreamt she saw the princely Beast in the garden by the fountain. "See, your strength, my Belle rose, my Beauty, that I value you beyond anything in the universe," he said, placing his head on her knees that she may pet it. They sat there, like that, a long time, while Belle plaited a beautiful wreath of flowers to drape about his neck.   Also included is the  urlLink commentary .  The first paragraph perfectly describes my Master:   "Beauty and the Beast" is another tale in which we have a shape-shifter, the man-beast who is loved and tempered by the feminine. At times, the Beast seems a version of the four archangels with his similitude to several different animals, so that one glimpses not only the taming of some harsher element of man, but also of a demanding god; or even, perhaps, the tale depicts that higher "other" reaching to become known in a form which is not what has been imagined, one different from the cruel and sadistic ruler of wishes and riches who demands sacrifice over the smallest offense or infringement.   Beauty and the Beast is simply a modern retelling of  urlLink Cupid and Psyche , which is also special to Us.  Katy

       Katy:   I've had a headache every night for almost a week.  When I have a headache, I can't wear my collar without making it worse.  Master is completely understanding, of course.  He reminds me that I am always collared, even when it is invisible.  But it is still disappointing to both of us.  It's been even worse because we haven't been able to play much this past week because of my health.    Thank you for taking such good care of me, Master.  I love you.

       Katy:   I was a naughty girl last night.  I stayed up late on a work night looking at spanking pictures and playing with my bullet.  When Master made my wake-up call at 6am, he could tell I was even groggier than normal.    Since we started playing with pain play again, our daily collaring and decollaring ritual has been enhanced with twice daily spankings.  The morning ones are always mild:  between 3 and 5 smacks on each buttock.  In the evening, Master will order me to spank myself at least ten times on each cheek, and often he will have me spank my thighs or my tits or my cunt.  But not too much if it's a work night.  Master ordered me to spank myself very hard for misbehaving last night.  In 11 days, he will be here to put me over his knee and spank me himself.  *shiver*

       Katy:   Master will be proud of me.  I fixed the permalink problems, and started an  urlLink index  for Captive Heart.  (Of course, after reading this, Master will also add... "but I'm always proud of you, my little slavegirl", which never fails to make me melt.)   Update:  I spoke too soon--the permalink to  this  post doesn't work.  So far all the others that I've tried work fine.  What does that mean?    Update II:  I think it means that this post can't decide if it was made in August or September.  The date on the post says September, but the permalink takes it to the August archives.  I can deal with losing one or two posts a month (especially nothing posts like this one), so I will leave well enough alone for now.

       Master  [understatement Alert] Katy likes spankings. [/understatement Alert]  I prefer to give them with my hand, as I like that skin-to-skin contact.  I  really  like that personal contact.  I also like floggers, hair brushes, belts and wooden spoons.  I especially grew to like tham after a recent ritual that involved a spanking that went on for at least 30 minutes.  My right hand still has the muscle memory of that - it hurt.  When we play on the phone, I almost always have Katy spank herself.  It can be a quick way of getting her into subspace, not to mention giving her orgasms.  Here is Katy spanking herself while talking to Master on the phone.  Her slave ass is just turning red.

       Master   Last night, I accepted Katy's offer to manage her reading habits which, regular readers of this blog will know, have been worrying me for a while.  She originally made the offer more than two weeks ago, and I deferred a decision - I wasn't entirely sure why at the time.  It just didn't feel 'right'.  It wasn't until her most recent post on the subject, and a bit more phone time, that I realised she wasn't really serious when she first offered.  She wasn't ready to hand over control of something that really is an issue for her.  I would probably have accepted her original offer if we were already living together, and not an ocean apart.  Why?  Because I would need to be physically present in her life to deal with the fallout of her offering a new degree of submission before she was ready.  Now she is ready.  I even think she understands that she will end up with more reading time, not less.  Watch this space for updates.  Additional thought: the converse of authority is, of course, responsibility.

       Master  In an earlier post  Love in the Mirror , Katy asked:   I know you thought I was going straight to bed, Master. So did I. But after we hung up, I found a little extra energy inside to write this for you. How did you feel when I found the word "free" that night? How did you feel to know that your slut has fallen in love with herself?   Free?  I have always said that I ask just two things of you: that you be yourself, and obedience.  You have long since given me your obedience.  it is only recently that you have truly been yourself, and I think "free" is the perfect word to describe where you are now.  You have submitted totally to me, and within that you have found your freedom.  I have been waiting for this moment, yet I find myself almost overwhelmed with emotion.

       Katy:   I've talked before ( urlLink here , scroll down to "Punishment") about my addiction to books.  Specifically, how I cannot read fiction without feeling compelled to read it cover to cover.  Tonight, I offered Master control of my reading habits.  It was a difficult offer to make, but I had a long time to think about it (including the bookless punishment week) and I think I am ready.  I asked Master to start by assigning me books that are short enough that I can read them over a weekend.  I would give him a list of books I was interested in, but he could assign any he chose to the list as well.  Then when I have become trained enough to put a book down during the weekend and not pick it up again until Master orders it, he can assign me books that will be stretched out over the course of a work week.    Currently, I am not allowed fiction on a work night, with the exceptions of short stories or books I have read so many times that I can put them down without suspense.  With Master's training, I will actually gain more reading time, since I will be able to pick up a book when I only have a few minutes, but not enough time to finish the whole thing.  If I can be trained (and train myself--I know it will be work for both of us) to put down a book on a work night without "jonesing" (best word I know of to describe the feeling) for it during the day at work, then Master will be able to leave a standing order that I am allowed a certain amount of time for reading at night.  As an example.  It could go either way.  Either Master could choose to train me out of bad habits and then let my reading be back under my control (as long as I protect the property), or he could choose to exercise complete control over my reading once I have the ability to read on work nights without it affecting my performance.  Incidently, Master has not accepted my offer yet.  He wanted to take time to think about it.  If he chooses not to accept it at this time, I think something similar will have to be done at some point in the future (perhaps when we are living together) if I am ever to be able to have healthy reading habits.  When I first made the offer, I had not yet accepted that it was something that needed to change.  I made the offer because I wanted to please Master.  But after thinking about it, and after writing this, I realize that it has to change.  It was not an unhealthy habit when I lived alone, because it didn't hurt anyone to carve 5 or 6 hours out of my day at a time to indulge myself.  But it is not a healthy habit for our relationship.  I understand that now, and I hope Master accepts the offer to help me change.

       Katy:   An excellent  urlLink post on humilation  at Dirty Whore Diary:   As someone who neither carries a burden of religious guilt nor feels society's disapproval when I am behind closed doors, I can't completely explain why humiliation (and very specific humiliation, at that) has become part of my repertoire. There is certainly an element of self-scolding in it, of inner astonishment and reproach that I am submitting to something so distasteful. It�s a Catch-22: the humiliation gives me the punishment I deserve for allowing myself to submit to the humiliation.   The redemption I crave after humiliation is a feeling of acceptance, forgiveness, and appreciation. �Yes, darling, you did that nasty thing, but I love and treasure you for suffering through it for me.� It�s more than telling me that things are ok; it�s an acknowledgement that the humiliation I endured was not an act of selfish pleasure on my part, but one of true discomfort that I underwent as a submissive act to please him, and that he does not judge me in any negative way for it (which quiets the scolding voices in my head), and that his affection is reinforced as a result. Complex, eh? This will need a longer post someday to explain, with examples.   I look forward to that longer post.  This is the closest description I've ever read of what I feel when Master humiliates me.  The redemption.  I need that feeling.

       Katy:   I once insisted we could never have mirrors in the bedroom. I often have nightmares, and sometimes seeing a reflection in the middle of the night can convince a half-awake mind that there's Someone in the room.   But as my mental health has improved, the nightmares have lessened. I agreed to try it, with the caveat that we could always cover the mirrors if my night terrors returned.   I started with a simple wall-mounted full-length mirror and hung it on the wall across from the foot of the bed. It was a few nights ago that I realized that I can watch myself masturbate.   I was on the phone with Master (I rarely masturbate without him, and we are discussing whether he should have full control over when and how I masturbate) and he ordered me to prepare the plug-in vibe and the hairbrush, and to lie on the bed with my legs spread. That's when I saw my reflection.   "If I move the comforter, Master, I will be able to see myself."   That pleased him greatly. He asked me to describe what I could see, and then ordered me to prop myself up with pillows (I was nearly sitting up) to improve my view.   And then the play began.   It was an exhilarating night.  (Sadly in contrast to today, with me being unwell again.)  It was startling to see myself in the mirror.  Before this mirror was installed, the only one I had was in the bathroom.  I enjoyed seeing myself just out of the shower, but though I often play with myself while bathing, the mirror isn't set up for that.  Looking only in that tiny bathroom.  No touching.  After Master ordered me into position, I could see up the length of my legs to the slit of my pussy.  Above that, I could see the hills of my belly and breasts.  Then, above a light chain collar closed with a lock, my face, topped with a tangle of sleep-mussed hair.  Master ordered me to watch, while I spanked each thigh and each breast.  He noticed that my voice kept getting quieter--having the mirror was sinking me into sub-space much faster and deeper than usual.  I could see the blows falling on my body, my eyes widening in pain and then softening as it melted into pleasure.  I seemed to feel everything twice, both as the masochist and the exhibitionist.  But I wasn't watching a stranger.  Not anymore.  I was watching a woman that I had nearly lost and then discovered all over again.  A woman I had fallen in love with over the past year.    Master found and loved her first.  But then he taught me to love her too.  She is beautiful in the mirror.  A slut-goddess, a warrior queen.  Had I ever really thought submission would rob me of my power?  Impossible!  This primal creature in the mirror was powerful beyond measure.    Master ordered me to come.  First I doubled over, my eyes closed, as the pleasure washed over me.  Then I remembered the mirror and lifted my face.  Opened my eyes.  There was more play, with the vibrator, and as I was coming down, Master asked me to describe how it felt.   "Powerful,"  I said.  "Sexy."  I paused.  "But that's not quite right.  There's another word, right at the tip of my tongue, and I can't bring it to mind."  "Try," he ordered.  I did.  But it wasn't until we were talking of other things that it struck me.  "Free!"  I said.  I think I interrupted him, but he was too happy to say anything if I did.  "I feel free!  I'm me, I'm finally me.  I can see me!"  It was what Master and I call a Breakthrough.  We had many of them during the start of our journey, but as I've grown stronger and we've grown closer, we haven't had as many.  But this weekend, in the middle of the night, I looked into my own soul and saw that the shackles are gone.  The demons of guilt and fear and indecision no longer have a claim on me.   As Master's slave, I am free.  I know you thought I was going straight to bed, Master.  So did I.  But after we hung up, I found a little extra energy inside to write this for you.  How did you feel when I found the word "free" that night?  How did you feel to know that your slut has fallen in love with herself?

       Master   The folks over  urlLink The Collar Purple  (sadly lacking in permalinks) have been discussing punishment and forgiveness.  We have both written about punishment before - you'll find it in the archives.  Blogger's archives are, as usual, shagged, so I can't link directly to them.  With occasional exceptions, an example of which I will come to, I do not punish Katy without discussing it first.  I may have mentioned that we talk about everything.  We talk a lot.  Punishment time is no exception.  For Katy, my disappointment is hard for her to bare - harder than any physical punishment, I think.  The exception: In a moment of extreme sassiness, Katy went to pinch both my nipples, catching one of them.  I immediately grabbed her and spanked her very hard.  Enough to make her squeal in genuine pain, although I am sure there were equal measure of shock in there .  She still remembers that incident, and hasn't attempted to repeat it.  Strangely enough, she didn't even need much of an explanation as to where she'd gone wrong.  Funny how that works, isn't it?  I have one golden rule about punishments:  Once the need for punishment has been discussed, and the punishment itself imposed, the incident causing it is forgiven and forgotten.  Unless, that is, she repeats the same offence within a short space of time.  In that case, the punishment will be much more severe, together with an extended discussion to discuss why she did it again.  I absolutely do not believe in dragging up past transgressions every time upsets occur.

       Master   I need to say up front that Katy gives by far the best blow jobs I have ever experienced.  By a very long way.  I have been trying to figure out why.  On the face of it, her technique is much the same as other women's.  In fact, her TMJ (although mild) should prevent her doing it as well as she does, as it prevents her from serious sucking for more than a few minutes.  (My cock is very thick, and so stretches her jaw muscles)  Her secret is that I know, beyond all possible doubt, that I have her full and undivided attention when she is servicing me orally.  Pleasing me becomes, more than ever, the centre of Katy's universe - nothing else matters to her.  Combine this with the obvious pleasure she gets from playing with it, stroking it, swallowing my copious amounts of pre-cum (not to mention my spunk) and you can see why I declare her to be the best cocksucking slut on the planet.  Here is a picture of Katy, doing unto me what she does best.

       Katy:   Master asked me how it felt to have my slutty pictures on the web now that we are starting to get some traffic.  I said it doesn't feel "real" to me yet.  I have so often seen these pictures on my monitor that it is hard to imagine the main difference now--that anyone else can see them too.  I said it won't feel real until other people comment on them.    Master ordered me to post that tonight.  So will you help me make it real?  Will you tell me what you think of these pictures?

       Katy:   A chat transcript from the first time we made love:   Master: Can you feel me kissing the nape of your neck?   katy: yes   katy: What is the state of your whiskers?  Freshly shaven?  Day's worth of stubble?  An actual mustache?   Master: Clean shaven.  I hate any sort of beard. Why do you ask?   katy: To help me imagine the nape-kisses.   Master: Ah.    Stubble would just scratch you - particularly unpleasant on the inside of your thighs.    *putting my arms around you to squeeze your breasts*    Nuzzling some more.   katy: *purr*   Master: Kissing from the top of your right arm, along the line of your shoulder and up the side of your neck ......    Squeezing those cute breasts of yours a little harder now.   katy: *squirming in pleasure*   Master: Repeating the kissing from the other shoulder inwards.    Your skin tastes good, little slut.    Finding your nipples through your dress, I'm giving them quick little pinches, alternating from one side to the other, while still nuzzling your neck.   katy: *moan*   Master: Do not move unless I order it, slut, ok?    Using my teeth to nip at your neck and shoulders, I pinch your nipples harder, the material of your dress taking the sharp edge off the pain.    Noticing this, in cyber only (unfortunately) I lift the dress over your head and throw it to the floor.       katy: *whimper*  Yes, Sir   Master: Leaving your nipples for the moment, I begin scratching your breats in circular movements, working from the outside in towards the nipples.    How do you feel?   katy: Aroused, Sir   Master: Good little slut.    For the first time, I pinch your uncovered nipples, hard enough to make you jump a little.    What's that happening between your legs, little slut?  Can I smell your sluttiness?   katy: Yes, Sir.  My cunt is growing moist.   Master: Good little slut.    I turn your chair around to face me.    I *can* smell my little slut.    Reaching down, I push two fingers inside you and gather up some slutjuice.    Open your mouth slut!    I push my fingers into your mouth.    Taste the depths of your passion, slut!    How do you feel?   katy: I ache for you, Sir.   Master: Pulling my jeans down, I move in towards you.    My engorged and aching cock is a few inches from your face, a drop of pre-cum at the tip.    What do you want to do, slut?   katy: I want to taste you, Sir.   katy: I want my tongue flicking the end of your cock   Master: Good girl.    You may move your head, but not your hands.    I then reach down and resume squeezing your breasts.   katy: I lean forward and lick off that drop of pre-come, savoring the flavor of this proof of your desire for me.     Master: Now it's my turn to groan, I have waited a long time for this.    I push forward, the tip of my cock entering your mouth.   katy: My lips stretch wide to take in your head and begin sucking, my tongue exploring you.   katy: I love the feel of your cock invading my mouth and moan against it.   Master: *groaning*    One of my hands moves to the back of your head, and eases your head a little further onto me. - not too far, not knowing how much you can take.    Mt free hand is twisting and pinching your nipples.   katy: My hands itch to stroke you, but I leave them obediently on my knees.  I begin drawing long slow drinks off your length, my lips moving further along your cock with every stroke.   Master: My slut is very good at this and I can feel my balls twitching.    You may move your hands.    Now both my hands are on your head as I begin to concentrate on using your mouth for my pleasure.   katy: I hum in happy aquiescense at being used in this way.  My hands touch your knees and graze up your thighs and reach around to draw my fingernails lightly across your ass.   Master: Which makes me groan and begin fucking your mouth, slut.   katy: I slide a hand around the curve of your hips to grasp and squeeze your cock just at the place where my lips touch so that you may fuck my hand/mouth as hard as you please.   katy: The other hand continues caressing your ass, drawing a finger along the cleft of your ass and following it underneath where I may play with your balls from behind.   katy: I realize I have forgotten something, so I drag my hand through my wet slutjuices and return it to your cock, now lubricated enough to be properly fucked.   katy: I let your hands on my head set the rhythm.  I am only a vessel for your pleasure.   Master: With a series of groans ......    Using my hands to hold your head still, relying on your hand to control the penetration, my hips begin thrusting hard.    I am practically blinded by the lust now, thinking only of using your mouth as a fuckhole for my aching cock.  I am dimly aware of it becoming easier to fuck you.    I am calling you "slut", "whore","my fuckhole", hardly aware that I'm saying it.   katy: I delight in the pleasure my Master takes from using my mouth.   katy: My nails drag backwards from your scrotum, across your perineum, to the pucker of your anus.   katy: Then back again to your balls, then straying down along your inner thighs.   Master: You feel my balls tense up and the spams in my cock begin as, with a loud moan, I cum in your mouth as your hands tip me over the edge.    You feel the first spurt of my semen in your mouth as I push forward hard.   katy: I drop the hand off your cock and let you penetrate my mouth fully when you begin to explode.     katy: My tongue cradles the length of your cock as I feel your cock against the back of my throat   katy: My hands grab your ass and pull you closer as I struggle to swallow every drop   Master: Another wave of orgasm washes over me as I slide deep into the back of your mouth.    Despite being out of my mind with lust and pleasure, I remember what I promised myself before I started mouthfucking you.    Still pumping semen, I pull out of your mouth and let the last of it fall across your breasts.    "rub it in, slut!  Smell my passion for you!"   katy: My lips futiley try to hold on to your cock, but when I hear your instructions, I understand.  I take your cock in both hands and use it to rub your semen into my breasts.   Master: How does that make you feel slut?   katy: I gaze up into your eyes, with your come trailing out of my mouth.  How does it make me feel?  I struggle to think of a coherent answer...   Master: I know you do, that's why I asked.    Weak at the knees from the intensity of my orgasm, I grab your hand and drag you onto the bed, where we snuggle.   katy: My tongue darts out and licks the semen off my lips.  My mouth aches deliciously from being used.   Master: I grab your head, turn it towards me and kiss you deeply.  My tongue probing your mouth, tasting me there.   katy: I melt against you, surrendering completely to you taking my mouth again, this time with your mouth.   Master: I pull you against me, continuing the kiss, not ready to stop the magic we do together..........    But, we will have to stop very soon - it's 10pm here.    I adore you.    I would like to carry on next time, from where we left off tonight.  This will give you a very good idea of how a typical BDSM session would go, and I think that would be valuable for you.   katy: Tomorrow?   Master: Yes, although two cyber sessions will probably only get us 1/3 of the way through a 3D session.    *Holding you close*    How do you feel?   katy: snuggly.  sexy.   Master: Good girl.    And a little frustrated?    The good thing about what we just did in 3D is that you would still be hot as hell and I would be ready to do much more to you.   katy: Only mildly frustrated, since I wasn't able to work on myself here.   katy: I'd likely be trying to grind against you as we snuggled, planting soft kisses against your skin, breathing your scent, tasting your sweat.   Master: I would be grinding and nuzzling back but, after a few minutes, I would be reaching for the large toybag I brought with me.    But that's for tomorrow.  *g*    Anticipation is everything.

      Looking at Katy's posts about being ordered to fuck herself with a hairbrush, you might be forgiven for thinking that, at least in the beginning, she was only a slut when I ordered it.  I don't think so!  The first non-sex toy (vibrator, dildo etc) that she ever fucked herself with an item she saw on the shelf when walking around either Wal-Mart or K-Mart.  I seem to remember her telling me she could see another use for it as soon as she laid eyes on it.  Here it is, in use.     Early on in our relationship, I had a minor worry about whether Katy was displaying submissive, masochistic and slutty tendencies in response to the fact that I am both a dominant and a sadist.  We talk.  We talk a lot.  I soon discovered that she has always had submissive tendencies and had thoughts and fantasies that could only be described as slutty, for many years before we met.  I am glad the submission is hers, within her, to be offered to her dominant.  This makes it all the more valuable to me.  I often remind her that one of the many reasons I love her is because she is a slut.  My slut.  I also tell her that there are only two things I require of her: obedience, and that she be true to herself.  I am pleased to report that both requirements have been met.

       Katy:   I am new (less than a year) to formal submission and BDSM, though I know now that I've been submissive my entire life.  So I am constantly examining myself and our relationship and trying to work out the psychology of it.  Why it turns me on.  Why it turns him on.  Why we both need it.  But one thing that I have actively avoided examining is this:  Why does humiliation turn me on?  I'm not really scared of the answer.  But Master and I both suspect that there may be a lot of emotional landmines charged up in it, and we prefer to wait until we are living together to explore that.  It likely has something to do with my religious upbringing, and that is just too icky to get into when we are too many miles and hours apart.  But when he posted the latest picture of me, he asked teasingly which one humiliated me more:  the one of me fucking myself with the hairbrush, or the one of my tits covered with his spunk.  I thought about it a while, then decided it was the hairbrush-fucking picture.  After all, that one was me behaving like the slut I am.  The other picture showed something kinky that was done  to  me.  Master pointed out that I was not restrained, so I had obviously allowed it to be done.  But still.  A lot more active sluttiness was required for me to insert the handle of a hairbrush into my slave cunt.  I crave verbal humiliation during scenes.  Sometimes I beg for it.  And now that I'm writing about it, I'm starting to have some idea that it might be about freedom.  That if everyone knew what a slut I was, then I'd never have to pretend to be anything else.  But let me slam the lid back down on that can of worms before a big anaconda slithers out and chokes me.  Master and I will face this one together, and the time is not now.

       Katy:    Exercise   I had to be amused when I read this on  urlLink The Collar Purple:    Long time readers of The Collar Purple are undoubtedly familiar with Invidia's aversion to exercise (in this case her thrice weekly walks.) The stated goals of many lifestyle submissives (or their Doms) are various sorts of 'improvements'. This might be exercise, better attendance at work/school, or simply keeping the house cleaner. Of course, when the sub's will fails, the Dom fills in the gap with inducements.   As you probably have guessed, punishment makes up a big part of the encouragement around here, but there are rewards as well. Her allowance is tied to good performance with her walking, and the cane is waiting if she doesn't exercise on schedule.   I may be the only sub whose Master ordered her  not  to go to the gym.  Not that I'm an exercise addict or anything.  And I bitch and moan as much as anyone else when it's time to get up (at 5am) to go to the gym.  But I really want to be strong and healthy, and my old battle with guilt means that if I don't go three times a week, I beat myself up.  (Master hates it when I do that.  He's the only one who's supposed to beat me!)   I have tendencies to overestimate my abilities and energy levels, and Master is very protective of me.  Since I haven't been healthy this week, no gym.  Yoga or stretching at home is allowed.  My favorite thing at the gym is lifting weights.  My least favorite thing is the treadmill.  When I get halfway through the twenty minute walk and I'm bored as hell and I haven't sweated enough to cool me down, I think about how much more I can please Master when my body is healthier and stronger and more flexible.  But I also think about how much  I'll  love having a healthier, stronger, more flexible body.  Since Master freed me from my demons, I've fallen in love with my body.  I love living in it (when it isn't busy trying to kill me, like it's done this week) and I love stretching my limits.  The last time I went to the gym, I got to move the peg up to the next highest weight on two different weight machines.  That's a great feeling.

       Master:  When Katy wrote about  The Pearl Necklace , this is what humiliated her when I told her to do it with the hairbrush I had just spanked her with.     She didn't know, when I started masturbating over her, that I wasn't actually going to touch her.  I could tell from the look in her eyes that she expected me to orgasm in her mouth.  I was just barely sane enough as I exploded over her tits to notice the look of animal lust, shock and humiliation on her face that I had actually done that.  Only then did I touch her, and that was to use my cock to rub my spunk into her chest.  That was probably the first time I made her feel like the incredibly beautiful slut and whore that she is.  She also smelt like one.

       Master :  Seems about right.    You must like to spank or be spanked, because your romance is remeniscent of Secretary. A truly modern love story, it shows that you don't need to be conventional to be normal. You're probably the type that owns a whole lot more leather than what's upholstering your car or sofa. Yeah, you know what I mean.    urlLink   What Romance Movie Best Represents Your Love Life?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       Katy:   Master told me today that not allowing me books may have been harder for him than for me.  It's been a tough week.  But I believe his guess is correct.  I often tell him that I have "the better end of the deal" as the submissive.  Sometimes I am teasing, because so often our play sessions involve him inflicting me with sensation while I just lay there.  But usually I am serious.  He has all the responsibility.  All I have to do is obey.  (Although he always adds "And be yourself", because I spent so much of my life trying to please others.  But I had a breakthrough recently when I realized that my lifelong struggle to please others was my submissive nature expressing itself inappropriately--but that's a post for another time.)  I often wonder if I thank him enough for all he does to take care of me and Us.  When I do, he usually responds by thanking me for submitting to his care.  I love Our life.  Even separated by time and space, even when my health is this bad--I love Our life.

       Katy:   Today is the last day of the book ban.  I had two serious tempations since the last time I wrote about it.    The first was on Friday night.  I had the worst headache.  You'd think that having a headache would preclude reading, but my headaches have nothing to do with eyestrain.  It's all in the back of the head and neck.  And reading something--escaping the pain for a few minutes--would have been heavenly.  An audiobook wouldn't have worked.  I couldn't listen to anything.  I was sensitive to sounds, not to light.    I didn't give in, but it was a hard thing.  My mind kept casting about, looking for something to distract me from the pain.  I would spot a book on the shelf near the bed.  "Shakespeare--I've been meaning to read  Richard III  ever since I listened to the biography of Thomas More.  I could--no I can't."  Then a few minutes later, "My illustrated version of  The Hobbit .  I could look at the pictures for a few--no I can't."  That went on until it occured to me to roll over so I couldn't see the bookcase anymore.  Finally, I went to sleep.  The second Hard Time was Saturday.  Grocery shopping.  I went to the big grocery store, which is always too crowded, especially on weekends.  I was in line at least 20 minutes, and it might have been 30.  I  always  flip through magazines in the grocery store line.  I compromised and only read the covers.  M was amused when I told him about it.  The headache is back today.  I'm going to have to see the doctor soon.  Whether I can read or not, I certainly can't go on like this.

       Beauty:    The Pearl Necklace   I wanted a hairbrush with a flat back.  I wanted Master to put me over his knee, pull up my skirt, and spank me with it.  Master had other ideas for the hairbrush.  We went to the drugstore and picked one out together:     When we got home, he put me over his knee, pulled up my skirt, and spanked me.  It doesn't make sense, but when my "Beauty" personality is front, I feel pain as pain.  I still love the submission and humiliation of a spanking--especially over the knee--but it hurts.  (My Max personality, on the other hand, is a genuine masochist and takes pleasure in the pain itself.)  This hairbrush is very thuddy and painful.  I very often cry out in pain when it is used, particularly when the strokes fall hard and fast.  After the spanking, Master ordered me to strip.  Then he ordered me to crawl to the toy chest in the  bedroom and return with a condom.  Since we are monogamous and have another method of birth control, we only keep condoms on hand for a few specialized types of play.  Like when Master ordered me to put a condom on the handle of the hairbrush and fuck myself with it.  While I fucked myself with the hairbrush, he masturbated himself near my face.  I hoped he would come in my mouth.  I can't remember if I begged for that, or if I was beyond words by that point.  It was very  humiliating to fuck myself with the hairbrush that had just spanked me, so that the visual effect could be a turn-on for Master.  It was exhilarating to know that my whorish behavior gave him such pleasure.  It was the first time Master had ever come on my tits.  When we looked at the pictures later, we realized that I was wearing a double pearl necklace.

       Master:  This is Katy in her Naughty Girl clothes.     This is her about an hour later.     When Katy is Naughty Girl, she is basically regressing to a much younger version of herself.  A time when her strict religious upbringing left her with a beautiful young body, and not a clue what to do with it.  The second picture shows Katy after I had caned, then fucked her.  I may have misremembered, but I think Katy received her first ever caning as NG.  I have a beautiful matched set of rattan canes, some varnished, some not, also of varying weights.  I told Katy she was going to receive 6 strokes from each cane, which I think  scared her - she didn't think she could take that many.  She tells me that one of her strongest memories of that particular scene, was of watching my cock grow more and more erect as I caned her.  I think that was the first time she truly understood that I am a sadist, as well as a dominant.

       Katy:    Bookless Day Three   The week without books continues, and somehow, I'm surviving.  The only books I use are the ones required for work.    Energy levels are low, and my mood is down.  Some stuff going on in my family has me on edge, but that will hopefully resolve itself in the next week or two.  Other stuff going on in M's family is probably not going to resolve itself that quickly, but it  would be very nice if it did.  Sorry to be enigmatic, but as much as I'd like to be "out", consideration for our families requires otherwise.    I hope M will post the picture of NG tonight, and I will write that story this weekend.  There's a lot I want to write about, and I'll eat the elephant one bite at a time.  *smooches*

       Max:   I just got off the phone with Master.  He wants me to write about the punishment, and he also wants Beauty to write about the picture.  I want to write about those things.  I want to write every day.  But my mental illness makes me tire easily, and though it is not even 8pm yet, I am already so fatigued.    I want to do so much more than I am doing, and I don't know how.  Master helps me manage my schedule.  But he cannot give me energy when I have none.  I resent being ill.  And it was while I was writing the previous post that I realized that my compulsive behavior towards book is not caused by the mental illness, but my attempts to escape it.  When I am reading, there are no dark thoughts in my head.  No mania, no depression.  Only the words and people born of the mind of another.  Someone else who may also be mentally ill, but in a different way.  So long as I don't have to be in my  own  mind when it is troubled, it is an effective escape.  Even stories of fear and pain and death.  But... there is no reading tonight.  Sure, I could find something to read online.  Master did not forbid the internet to me.  He even allowed me audiobooks, which was generous of him.  But I am able to be a bit more separate in those formats.  When I am reading a book, I am wholely Other.  (Actually, I can escape quite easily into an ebook--I read Stephen King's  Tommyknockers  that way--but I am going to interpret my punishment by the spirit rather than the letter.  Websites or blogs are allowed, but I will not allow myself ebooks.  Do you agree, Master?)  So, given that books are a type of therapy for me, was my punishment deserved?  Yes.  It was.  Master had ordered me to be in bed by 9pm, informing me that that was a drop-dead limit.  He understands that I usually read for a few minutes after going to bed.  The error came in reading for 45 minutes.  We have agreed that once my punishment is lifted, I will prevent a recurrance by placing a bookmark in the book at the point where I must stop.  It will take some trial and error to determine how many pages I can read in 15 minutes, but after that, it should be easy.  We talked for a very long time last night about punishment.  I was concerned because Master had said that if I repeated the error for a third time, or more, then it would cause problems in our relationship.  This bothered me greatly because I know there will be slip-ups in the future.  If I sat up too late reading 6 months from now, would the punishment be escalated?  Master assured me that he will treat slip-ups differently than repeat offenses or rebellion, and that we will always discuss the error and the punishment so that we both agree on what occurred, and why, and what is to be done about it.  Which is good, because I can imagine by the time we're both in a nursing home, he'll have a hard time figuring out how to escalate the punishment for the 97th offense of staying up too late reading.  I offered to let Master schedule my reading.  He wants to train me to be able to put a fiction book down and go on to other activities, without feeling compelled to read the whole book at once.  I am terrified of having to do this.  The way I am now, if I am forced to stop reading in the middle, there is a part of my mind always on the book and trying to get back to it, to the detriment of whatever else I am supposed to be doing.  In a way it reminds me of a phobia I used to have about being in crowds.  I was afraid to get therapy for it, because if I was cured, I'd have to go out in crowds.  Even at the time, I recognized the logical phallacy:  if I was cured, I wouldn't mind going into crowds.  Likewise, if I learned to stop reading a book partway through, then it wouldn't bother me to do it.  The problem is, I don't know how I will learn to do it without actually having to do it.  At the time I made the offer, Master didn't realize how scary it was for me.  After our long talk last night, he does now.  So he made the decision to not accept my offer yet, and said that we will talk about it a week after my punishment ends.  I'm supposed to think about it more--something I'm not really good at.  I'm a fighter, not a thinker.  Especially during the week, when I need my thinking energy for work.  I saw two problems:  Master was unhappy with my reading habits, and I wanted to find a way to submit more, and the offer seemed like a solution to both problems.  But I will think about it.  At the weekend.

       Max:   I'm all alone.  Master is gone, though he will be back online soon.  No one is here at work.  The one demon I will always have, the mental illness demon, stalks around inside my head muttering dark incantations.  They will not work.  The war is  over.  He is not destroyed, but he is contained, and I know now that the darkness does not come from within my soul.  I can't ignore the incantations entirely--the only ways to blot them out are to bury myself deep in sleep or a book--but I don't have to believe them anymore.  I touch my collar and feel Master's strength and care wash over me.  That is reality.  The demon is only a mist, born of misplaced biochemicals.  He cannot win.

      Master:  I had to punish Katy last night.  A second time for the same offence.  This made it much more serious.  Katy has some minor mental health issues that, for the first time in her life, are under control (thanks to a combination of good medication and her own strength).  One of the remaining issues is that she often gets distracted by books.  If the book is fiction, she finds it almost impossible to put down until she has finished it.  This, particularly on a work night, is a violation of the 'protect the property rule'.  (A rule which, BTW, applies equally to both of us)  Last time Katy transgressed, she received a severe spanking.  She was even more upset because I was disappointed in her.  Despite this, she went and did it again two nights ago.  I was very disappointed, so was she.  She was also very annoyed with herself.  I am a fan of making the punishment fit the 'crime', where possible.  After discussion, I imposed a total book ban of one week (which she will find  very  hard, and a severe spanking.  Unsurprisingly, Katy felt particularly submissive afterwards, as well as very owned and cherished.  Me?  She is my submissive, and we are moving towards a 'no limits' relationship as we get closer to living together.  That does not strictly mean that there are no limits,  just that Katy has given over complete control to me.  (And no, that does not mean she has become a doormat)  It does mean that I expect her obedience.  Today's catchphrase?  I love her enough to punish her.

       Max:   When I read other blogs by couples in 24/7 kinky relationships, I am both encouraged and discouraged.  Encouraged, because I can see there are other people living our lifestyle and making it work, and because it gives me hope that we'll be able to be "out" one day.  But discouraged because these people are living together, and Master and I are so far apart.  I know it is only a matter of time and patience (and money... always fucking money!) until we are living together, either in one country or the other.    My Max personality is not very patient.

      Master:  To say that my pretty slavegirl likes to worship my cock, would be something of an understatement.  For me, having my submissive at my feet reinforces everything I am: dominant, sadist, Daddy (yes, we have a 'Daddy's little girl' dynamic as well) etc.  It doesn't actually matter whether my cock is in her mouth.  Having her leaning against me, arms around my waist, head resting in my groin, while my hands are in her hair, is emotionally very powerful for both of us.  This is one of my favourite positions to collar her in.  The other has me sitting on the edge of the bed, while she kneels in front of me - the advantage of this is that I am already sitting if my knees go weak when she sucks me - she is very good at it.  Katy is misremembering one thing - I have not said I can barely feel it when she kisses and licks my shaft.  I have explained that most of the nerve endings are in the head , and also the foreskin, and that stimulation anywhere else is not as effective.  That doesn't mean I don't like it!  It is possible I like receiving oral sex more than most men.  (I also love returning the favour, even though one DimDomWannabe once told me it wasn't very dominant of me to enjoy eating pussy - but that is another post for another day)  My last two partners both had TMJ severely - Katie has it mildly.  One of them also had an aversion to bodily fluids, and even preferred the taste of latex to the taste of my cock.  (It wasn't a hygiene issue - Katie will tell you how fastidious about keeping myself clean)  I was mildly offended by this, although I tried to hide it.  It is difficult for me to describe how powerful are the emotions caused by having a slavegirl who actually  wants  to worship my cock; who actually enjoys it and loves to swallow.  (Although she also likes it when I come over her breasts and/or face)  I have very intense orgasms during oral sex.  I am quite sure this is as much due to the emotions as it is the physical pleasure of having slavegirl who gives the best head I have ever experienced.  Master, how does it feel when I lick around the circumference of your cock near the base? When the ends of my hair brush against your skin? When my wet lips trail kisses from the base of your cock towards the head?  I believe I have answered those questions.

       Katy:   To be on my knees before Master is bliss.  I feel complete.  I feel enveloped in his love and support and dominance.  I feel  myself , the me that was locked up in a virtual chastity belt for so long.  Not only am I doing what  I  want and need to do without shame or guilt or fear, I am doing it with someone who wants me.  Once I told someone what I really wanted, more than anything, was to have someone who would pay attention to me.  With Master, I always have his attention, whether I am on my knees, caressing his cock with my hair, but when we are both at work, an ocean apart.  Obviously I prefer the former.  For this telling, I will imagine that Master has given me permission to make love to him in any way I choose.  There are other times when he grabs my hair, pulls me to my knees, and fucks my mouth.  And other times when he orders me to clean his cock after sex.  There are so many ways of loving his cock with my mouth that I can write about this for years.  And will.  I am at Master's feet, nuzzling his cock with my face and hair.  We often sit like this, when watching television perhaps, or maybe one of us is reading to the other.  Just being together requires nudity--not in the sense of him ordering me to go unclothed, though that is a routine order.  More like gravity.  We could no more keep barriers between us than fly.  And whenever possible, some part of me is touching his cock.    I love Master's cock.  It is beautiful.  It is very thick and long and intact.  His pubic hair is thick and dark, and I often burrow my nose into it and inhale.  I enjoy licking and kissing the shaft of his cock.  He says he can barely feel it.  My hair is soft and fine, and I love to drag it over Master's body, his legs and cock and balls.  I am growing it long as a gift to Master.  By the end of the year, I may be able to wrap his cock in my hair.  Master, how does it feel when I lick around the circumference of your cock near the base?  When the ends of my hair brush against your skin?  When my wet lips trail kisses from the base of your cock towards the head?

          Master   Katy, in everyday life (not real life - BDSM is part of our real life), is a businesswoman and dresses the part.  Underneath the professional exterior, can be found the slut.  Katy took the above picture in a hotel room, during a recent business trip.  That picture is a perfect example of why it is great to belong to a life form that has two sexes.  It is mostly katy's Max energy that does the professional stuff.  It is that energy that most loves letting go, surrendering to a strong Master.  We regularly role play blackmail scenarios, where she is forced to surrender for a weekend to a sadistic and dominant Master.  Max dives very deeply, differently to the others.  I can't quantify the difference, but it is  very  obvious.  Katy is collecting formal business wear from Goodwill stores.  Why?  So they can be cut or ripped from her body.  A scenario:  She comes home from the office.  Someone is waiting behind the door.  She is grabbed from behind and the door slams shut.  She knows it's me.  She thinks it's me.  It should be me.  Is it me?  A blindfold is pulled over her eyes and cuffs slapped on her wrists.  The arms pinning her are strong.  She cannot escape.  She is pushed face down onto the floor.  A knee in the small of her back pins her down.  A sharp knife opens the jacket from neck to hem.  A rough hand tears her blouse from her back.  She's whimpering; perhaps crying.  She struggles as her skirt is lifted and her pantihose pulled down.  The unseen assailant shifts position, grabbing her wrists and holding them tight against the small of her back as he moves between her legs and a well-lubed cock pushes at her tight anus.  Insistent, demanding an entry that cannot be denied.  She is entered smoothly and slowly.  Can she hear a grunt above her whimpering as his balls slap against her buttocks?  Is she pushing back against him as he begins thrusting?  Is the note of her little noises changing?  She's being used like the piece of fuckmeat she knows herself  to be.  Did she just blurt out "Fuck me!"?  He releases her hands now, knowing she's surrendered.  She reaches back as best she can, grabbing him, pulling him into her.  It is difficult to say who shouts loudest as she orgasms violently as she feels his cock explode deep inside her.  He lowers himself onto her, support much of his weight on his elbows.  "Welcome home, my pretty slavegirl..", her Master growls in her ear.  So, my two loyal readers: what do you think of this scenario?

       Master   katy is confused.  I do not tolerate mutt.  I run a dog lover simulation.  It's very effective.  During our first time together, katy had to work for three days.  I took mutt for a walk several times.  I didn't even succumb to the urge to dropkick mutt off the balcony and into the lake, after mutt ran in front of me and caused me to go flying.  But it  is  a simulation and can be crashed.  Like when mutt took a dump on the back seat of the car.  I wasn't even in the same country at the time, so katy didn't have to tell me, but she did.  It took me a week (maybe more) to restart the simulation.  I am a cat person - did I mention that?

       Katy:   I love being a submissive.  I have been submissive all my life, and now that I have a strong Master, it brings me even more joy to be my true self.  However there is one particular disadvantage to being submissive.  My dog doesn't listen to me.  Why should she?  It is obvious that I'm not the alpha bitch of the pack.  It must vex Mutt greatly that an inferior bitch has control over doorknobs and leashes.  We've been through a training course, and she knows all the commands, but she obeys them or not as it suits her.  Everything changes when Master is here.  She recognized him immediately as an Alpha Male, and refused to meet his eyes for several days.  Then after an unfortunate incident involving rough sex and a broken table, Mutt became anxious whenever we created any kind of creaking rhythm.  The second visit, you could almost see the thought in her head "Oh shit, not HIM again!"  But this time, her strategy was different.  Whenever Master and I became close, Mutt tried to wiggle between us.  At first we thought she was jealous of the attention that I was paying Master.  But soon it was obvious.  Mutt wanted Master for herself.  Mutt wanted to replace me as the Alpha Bitch.  Master is not a dog lover, but he tolerates Mutt for my sake.  Mutt's designs to engage his affections are in vain.  But she obeys any order he gives, all the while ignoring me.  Now that Master is gone, Mutt has returned to thinking herself the head of the pack and not listening to a word I say.  What's a submissive to do?

       Master   Seen over at  urlLink Something Changed , a blog that will go on our blogroll at the next update.   "I do not want to be the leader. I refuse to be the leader. I want to live darkly and richly in my femaleness. I want a man lying over me, always over me. His will, his pleasure, his desire, his life, his work, his sexuality the touchstone, the command, my pivot. I don't mind working, holding my ground intellectually, artistically; but as a woman, oh, God, as a woman I want to be dominated. I don't mind being told to stand on my own feet, not to cling all that I am capable of doing but I am going to be pursued, fucked, possessed by the will of a male at his time, his bidding."  ~Anais Nin~

       Master   To say that I enjoy torturing katy's nipples would be something of an understatement.  I love to twist them; pull them, bite them; cane them etc.  (Yes, I really have caned katy's breasts, and will again)  Perhaps, if someone asks nicely enough, I will post pictures of the welts after her breasts have been caned.  Nipple torture is a really good way to feed the InnerSadist.  They are very sensitive, and I get loads of feedback.  Torturing her nipples when she straddles my cock is also a wonderful way of reminding her that she may be on top, but I retain control.  ;-)  Anyway, here are her nipples after I had been twisiting and biting them for a while.  You'd think they'd be redder, wouldn't you?

       Master   A year ago today, I was coming to the end of a long-term relationship.  At the time, I was quite convinced that I was in no emotional shape to even think about my next relationship.  I  was  is a position to offer katy mentoring - I had done this several times before for a newly-emerging submissive.  I was quite clear at the time as to what I could and couldn't offer katy.  Here's an excerpt from the e-mail I sent in response to what katy described in her previous post:   What can I offer? Mentoring  Introductions to 'safe' kinky people (you should talk to more than just me - like ordinary life, there are many variations to TTWD)  Reading material recommendations  Some basic 'exercises' that might help your initial explorations  Unconditional, no-strings-attached, friendship of the 'more than friend, less than lover' type  A non-judgemental shoulder to cry, laugh, rest or whatever on  100% honesty and open-ness - if I think you're about to make a terrible mistake, I will tell you so and why.  If you choose to do it anyway, I will still be here to pick up the pieces if necessary  What can't I offer? Any more than extended friendship  Physical experience with me (although I would still hope to meet you)   Ah, how times have changed.  Any way, katy is mostly right about how it is the submissive who must offer their submission to the Dom.  A Dom can (and I eventually did) Indicate that they will accept the submission, if it is offered.  The Dom may even say something like "I would love for you to submit to me."  But, in the final analysis, the submissive must offer themselves to the Dom.  I love you, my slavegirl.

       Katy:   Back when Master wasn't my Master, but John, a sexy gentleman that was answering my questions about BDSM, we had this exchange:   Katy: gonna make me beg?    John: Hah!    The fast answer is: hell yes!    The serious answer is that I don't have the right.    Katy: and if i offered you the right?   A few times before, I had tried to provoke John into "making" or "forcing" me to behave submissively, and he always responded that he didn't have the right.  All the while, he continued gently mentoring me in what a healthy consenting BDSM relationship could be.    One year ago today, it occured to me that instead of trying to provoke him into dominating me, I had to ask.  Everything he had been telling me about this lifestyle had emphasized consent.  Therefore, he would never take my submission from me until I offered it freely.  So I did.  The submissive partner paradoxically has to take the lead in establishing consent.  It is even more important for us personally, with my mental illness, that I be prepared for each new phase of our relationship.  So I often find, in reflecting on the journey we have taken, that I initiated many of the turning points.  And each time, I discovered that I had reserves of courage to help me reach for what I wanted.  The first time it happened was when John and I were corresponding by email and he included his ICQ number after the signature.  I assumed that it was a standard sig line (I learned later that it was not and that he rarely gives out the number) but took the chance of initiating IM contact.  The exchange above was the second time.  When I realized that for the relationship to go beyond mentoring and into Dominance, I had to make the offer.    There was a pause between my offer and his (carefully neutral) answer, and I assumed (in my naivete and insecurity) that I had made an unwelcome advance.  That he looked upon me with pity, as a kindly and indulgent teacher might look upon a student who had developed a schoolgirl crush.    I can only guess that my courage was completely used up in making the offer, and there wasn't enough left over to help me correctly judge John's reaction (which was far from pity).  But that's okay.  Each time it has been required, I've found that my strength and courage are sufficient for the next step.  Formal submission to Master didn't come until later.  But it was one year ago today that our journey began.  I love you, Master.

       Master   katy called me from her parent's house today.  They have met me several times, and approve of our relationship.  (We had some initial worries that they might disapprove of the fact that I am twelve years older than katy)  Today, however, katy's Mother crossed a line.  She called me, and this is an exact quote: "A cute, sweet, small, teddy bear."  I am 6', and 200 pounds.  My hairiness and shape means I will accept "teddy bear", but cute, sweet and small?  Normally, I would have spanking thoughts about any woman who sassed me to that degree, but my brain (quite rightly) refuses to entertain such an idea about katy's mother.  *long suffering and melodramatic sigh*

       Katy:   I suspect (though I'm not positive) that the post below is mostly meant to be silly.    How do you punish a masochist?  If she is also a submissive, then it isn't hard at all.  I've read in some forums about the difference between play spankings and punishment spankings and some people were very adamant that there be a clear line between them.  To a hypothetical observer, I'm not sure it would be clear when I'm being punished and when I'm being played with.  There is a very strong component in our play of me being a bad girl and having to be "punished" for being such a slut.  He uses those words, and I need to hear them.  There have been several play sessions when I've taken a great deal more pain than Master has ever given me for a genuine punishment.  When I've genuinely transgressed, it's different.  Not because the words are different.  Not because the pain is different.  Not even because I'm not ordered to come after the spanking (which usually--but not always--happens during play).  It's because I've  urlLink disappointed Master .  I am deeply submissive.  Each time I think I've reached the limit, I discover new depths of submission inside me.  I used to feel ashamed of how much I had tried to be someone else to please others--parents, teachers, religious authories.  Until one day I realized--I was still myself through all those years.  My true self is found in Submission, and until I found Master, I tried to submit to whatever authority I could find.    Now my submission is healthy, because it is a choice I made consciously, and because the Master I've submitted to made the conscious choice to claim me as his.  He deserves my submission, in a way none of the authorities of my childhood did.  I deserve his active and loving Dominance.  I never deserved the abuse and neglect I received when I gave my submission inappropriately.  I grew up mired in guilt, usually for things that weren't my fault.  Now, when I genuinely transgress, Master talks to me.  I feel the guilt, but it's for something I actually did.  I hate to disappoint Master.  I have a great need to be a Good Girl.  He punishes me.  The punishment could be seen as symbolic, if you compare the actual pain inflicted by a punishment spanking vs. playtime.  But I feel it.  There is no pleasure.  Until afterwards.  Master says "Now come and snuggle with me," and I know that everything is alright again.  Instead of endless vague guilt, I've been told what I did wrong and what I must do in the future to do right.  And the punishment ends the guilt.    Is it absolution that makes the play punishments so hot for me?  Is it because it's an eroticized version of the transgression-punishment-forgiveness cycle?

       Master   How do you punish a masochist?  You can't spank her - she'll enjoy it, she can (in the right circumstances) convert the pain into pleasure.  That's not what you want if she's been a naughty girl and you need to punish her, is it?  That rather rules out the canes and floggers too, doesn't it?  Do you really want to tell her she  won't  be getting pain of any sort for, say, seven days?  I am a sadist, as well as a dominant, and I do not want to forgo the infliction of pain for a week?  So what is a SadoDom to do?  How having her write you an essay about whatever her transgression was?  Does she hate ironing?  Have her do extra.  Anybody else have a thought?

       Master   One of the earliest things katy and I discussed was that we are both open to the possibility of sharing.  Not swapping/swinging, but sharing.  For example: a good friend of mine is a maker of rattan canes (I have a complete set).  He is also very good at using them, and will often give a demonstration at kinky play parties.  It is my intention that he will at some point cane katy.  Katy has a fantasy where she is sucking my cock while another man fucks her hard.  I am up for that, should the right circumstances and man present themselves.  So far, we have only talked about this, and I have woven some hot fantasies around it while we play.  Yesterday, I chose to tell some of it to a good friend.  I also told him that it is possible he would be one of the men I would share katy with.  I told katy this during our phone call last night.  To say that she dissolved into a puddle of mush would be something of an understatement.  Why?  Because now a 'real' someone else - not a faceless web site visitor - knows about her, and her slutty desires.  This helps make it more 'real', and is very hot.  For both of us.

       Master   katy has some health problems that I won't details here for the sake of our privacy.  (Yes, I know we've posted graphic pictures, but our faces are not shown)  We have both come to realise that I am often (but not always) better able to judge katy's ability to do things than she is.  As a consequence, I sometimes have to tell her "No" to hard play (or any play at all), trips to visit family, and other things.  Katy can sometimes be terribly disappointed when we can't do things together.  She often apologises and behaves as thought it is her fault.  She is slowly learning that it isn't, and that she isn't perfect.  I do not enjoy denying her things (with the possible exception of orgasms), but I do accept responsibility for it.

      Master and I have been too tired to post much the last few days.  Hopefully one (or better, both) of us can manage tomorrow.  In the meantime, with so many sex blogs on hiatus, I clicked around looking for new and found  urlLink Screamer Girl .    There are a lot of femsub blogs out there, most of which I don't read because I  am  a femsub, and I know what I think.  But something about Screamer Girl's perspective and writing style just "click" for me.  So while you're waiting for us to come back, hang out over there a while.  You'll be glad you did.

       Katy:   This picture was taken last year, when Master generously allowed me to have his birthday spanking.  Unfortunately, we were apart, so I had to do the honors myself:     Even more unfortunately, we will probably be apart again this year.  It looks like we get to choose between Master's birthday or Christmas, because money won't allow both.  So, going with tradition, do I want a birthday spanking from Master?  Or coal and switches in my stocking because I was a Naughty Girl?

       Master   katy has a mild vaginal dryness problem.  It is somewhat less of a problem since she found her Master.  Katy has never had children, which I am sure accounts (at least in part) for her exceptional tightness.  This tightness, with the occasional dryness, coupled with my rather large (no I am not bragging) cock, means we sometimes have to give nature a helping hand and use lube.  Stay with me.  There is a point to the preamble.  The first time I chose to make katy's oldest fantasy (the chained and tortured prisoner one) come true, was memorable, to say the least.  The picture below shows katy just before the main action started.  She is wearing leather wrist and ankle cuffs, to which chromed chain is padlocked and attached to the legs of the bed.  This scene was quite long, as I spent some time torturing her nipples, flogging her, scratching her.  I also spoke to her, telling her how she was my prisoner, and that I was going to torture her, then use her for my own pleasure.  Her groans and whimpers were the loudest I've ever heard from her.  At the end, when I entered her, it was like a hot knife going through butter.  Her pussy was so wet, she was leaking onto the bed.  I was ball-deep without effort - she screamed.  An amazing scene, and one that we will revisit.

      I just  urlLink read this:    The Enslavement Hypothesis is that there are submissives who have an overwhelming need to be possessed by a dominant. Given the right environment, the submissive can be coaxed out from behind the protective walls she has built during her life and made to expose all of her Self to her Master. Among other things this requires that he creates an environment which is emotionally safe and in which her underlying character will be accepted, probably for the first time in her life. During this process, the bond between the submissive and her Master becomes sufficiently strong that she can no longer break it herself, and she has then been enslaved.    I agree with most of this.  So much of my life has brought me to the point of wanting to be owned.  But I think (I don't know) that if Master ever became abusive to me  (we're talking *major* hypotheticals here, like him being taken over by aliens) , I would have the strength to break the bond.  He has taught me how I deserve to be treated, and I will never settle for anything less again.

       Katy:   Master and I talk (at least) twice a day.  He gives me a wake up call in the mornings and I put him to bed in the evenings.  That's how the time zones work out.  (damn I wish the earth were flat so we could be in the same when, if not the same where!)  Tonight's evening started, as it usually does, by me undressing as soon as I come in, kneeling by Master's side of the bed, and dialing his number.  As soon as he said hello, I begged, "Will you collar me, Master?  Please?"  I hadn't said those words in a while.  I'd forgotten how powerful they are.  There are words to our collaring ritual that we always use.  The variation is only slightly different when we are physically together.  I kneel at his feet and press my breasts against his legs.  He buries his hands in my hair (getting quite long and badly in need of a haircut *g*) and if he pushes my head onto his cock, it's hard for me to tell because I'm eagerly lunging for it.  In 3D, he collars me while his cock is in my mouth (or my face resting against his cock if he needs a shower or my jaws are sore).  On the phone, I have to attach the collar.  But we both can almost physically feel the connection between his cock and my mouth.  Today he said, "Suck it, slut.  Do what you do best."  That reminded me of  urlLink his post  about why he loves my blowjobs and I melted.  Both emotionally and physically.  As he always does after the collar is attached, he ordered me to "Cum now!"  And I did.  Then I whimpered.  "Use me, Master.  Please use me."    "Not just yet," Master said, and I whimpered in agony.  I had fallen into sub-space so hard and fast, even more so than usual during the ritual, in memory of that post.    "Get the sheath and the new vibrator and crawl into The Cave."  The sheath is a (fake) leather knife sheath that makes an excellent spanking strap.  The Cave is the walk-in closet.  There's barely enough room for me to lie on my back with my feet resting on either side of the doorframe.  There's really not enough room for Master to crawl in with me, but we manage it sometimes anyway.  There are eyebolts to attach my ankle restraints to the points on the door frame and another one on the back wall to hold a chain going from it to my collar.  I can't use the ankle bondage points by myself, but just crawling into The Cave and turning off the light makes me feel like a prisoner.  Trapped.  Helpless.  Being a prisoner is my oldest fantasy, predating my sexual awareness by many years.  As a young child, I remember reading tales where someone was kidnapped and imprisoned and feeling warm between my legs.  The second time Master chained me to the bed (the first was a Special Circumstance which we may write about one day), he said my cunt was wetter than he'd ever known.  Being in The Cave, though I'm not bound, still engages the prisoner fantasy.  Just flipping off the light sends me another level down into subspace.  Master had me place one of the bullets just inside my cunt, then lie on my side with my legs closed to hold it in.  Then he had me spank my left cheek.  We do a daily spanking during each call, time and health permitting, but only occasionally is pleasure applied at the same time.  The new vibrator is  very intense .  It has 8 settings, but the lowest is more intense than any of the vibrators I've used before.  (And I will still write a separate review, after I've had more time with it!)  Master knows this vibrator is intense.  He also knows that I am a masochist and quite often come during a s panking, especially when he spanks my cunt.  He, being a Sadist, told me I was not allowed to come until he permitted, and said he might not allow me to come at all tonight.  This made me whimper.    The spanking ritual goes like this:  Master announces how many strokes I am to receive and where I am to receive it--ass, tit, or inner thigh.  On the left side, I count the strokes, and on each stroke Master says something to me.  Something like "You are a naughty slut and you must be punished".  On the right side, Master counts and I say things.  Like "Thank you for the pain, Master."  Tonight was ten strokes on each cheek, followed by hard and fast strokes on the breasts.  All while the vibrator buzzed along in my cunt.  I begged Master to give me permission to come.  More than the desire to orgasm (which was significant) was the desire not to disobey Master and come without permission.  Master said no, and had me switch from spanking myself to pleasuring my clit with the other bullet.  All while he was weaving the most delightful word-spell.  Master has the sexiest voice you can imagine, and he can weave a fantasy out of mist.  Perhaps one day he will give me permission to record him while he does it so I can transcribe his stories.  He writes too, and well, but the stories he weaves aloud are the most magical.  At some point, he ordered me to come, again and again.  And at some point he brought me back to reality and then back out of The Cave.  I cleaned the vibrator and we talked and laughed about ordinary things.  He was fading because it was after midnight his time.  (Yes, we are now trapped a day apart from each other!  It's amazing how lonely that makes me feel and how the coming of midnight here on the rare times when I'm awake for it makes me feel closer to him.)  We set up our wake-up call for the morning--5am, because I've gotten permission from Master to  urlLink go back to the gym .  And sometime during all this, he asked what had brought on the mood I was in--especially submissive and clingy--and I said that when I heard him say that I was doing what I do best, I couldn't help but crawl under him.  I love you, Master.

       Master   katy is not my first submissive.  She is without doubt the most submissive partner I have ever known.  She may also be the most masochistic, although we are still exploring that.  What does it feel like to have a beautiful woman at your feet, whimpering and wiggling?  The purely visual impact is the quick answer.  Watching and listening to an intelligent woman dissolve (almost literally) into a puddle of multi-orgasmic mush is incredible.  I love seeing the orgasmic blush spread across her chest; hearing her whimpers and cries; watching the pleading look on her face as she begs for permission to cum - telling me how she'll do anything for me (and means it); anything to get  the release that orgasm will bring her.  But all that is as nothing when compared to the emotional impact.  Katy is both beautiful and very intelligent, and leading on her this wonderful journey we have embarked upon is emotionally transporting.  I once answered one of katy's questions about dominance by saying: "Dominance and sadism aren't things I do - they're what I am."  Katy's submission (total surrender, even) allows me to be who I am. What greater gift could I receive?

       Katy:   Virtual SpankBoss suggests  urlLink an idea for a reality show :     That's what we need... a reality TV show where the contestants get their hineys whooped! I betcha the ratings would give American Idol a run for its money, heh. Let's not forget the Celebrity Week where stars who are on the downward slide from famous seek publicity. While I wouldn't care for, for example, Mr. T's butt on my TV screen, there are a number of former A-list actresses who would make fine targets.    I disagree.  I would quite enjoy Mr. T's ass, thank you very much!  Of course I'd much rather be the one turned over  his  knee....

       Master   katy has a problem with understanding the concept of the mindfuck.  She perceives it as something BigBadandScarey.  Something that actually terrifies her - raises her anxiety levels off the scale.  So much so, that we have postponed the issue - even talking about it - until we can be together permanently.  This, even though katy trust me completely.  Her anxiety levels rose alarmingly even when I explained a very mild mindfuck.  The kind I did to her the first time we played.  I had her spread-eagled on the bed, restrained and blindfolded.  I waited several minutes before touching her, wanting her to 'stew' for a little while.  I then touched her right breast.  I think I cupped it gently.  She would have elevated right off the bed if she hadn't be restrained.  She had been expecting me to hurt her and was tensed-up, waiting for it.  She was ok, and after checking in with her, the scene proceeded well.  Last night, I explained to her that what she had experienced was a mindfuck.  I had led her to believe I was going to do something, then done something quite different.  There may have been a question in there somewhere, but it momentarily escapes me.

      Because you get to own one of these:     And she's all mine!  Bwahhahahahahahahahahah!  Ain't she something?  I like the 'waterfall' collar.  The collar part is black leather, the 'waterfall' made from heavyweight jeweller's chain.  The spectacular skin parts are all natural and all katy's.

       Master   The sharp-eyed among our two loyal readers will have noticed DScussion appearing in our kinky linkage.  Carolyn, one of the administrators over there, and a friend of ours, described DScussion thusly:   DScussion is a BDSM discussion board, with a heavy emphasis on reality.  The board is divided into areas for newcomers; for discussions about play styles, toys and techniques; as well as for "lifestyle" issues.  This is a great place to ask questions, or raise issues that you'd like to discussion with intelligent, reality oriented kinky folk.   So get on over there.  You will need to register, but you don't give your real name or anything silly like that.  You'll see us there, posting as Steve or katy.

       Master   Two posts down, katy said:    I asked him what would happen if the touch or even the scent of him at the airport made me come without permission. He said I would have to be punished. I asked how he might punish me.  He described the cruelest thing I can imagine. Tying me down with my legs spread, pulling back his foreskin, and fucking me with just the head of his cock. Not filling me up. Not touching my g-spot.    katy regularly asks me how I might punish her, usually during play.  This is exactly what happened last night.  She was in subspace as we played on the phone.  I long ago discovered that a quick way to make her dive deeply and enhance her orgasms was to answer with a particularly cruel punishment.  Last night it backfired as, despite her being in subspace, she interpreted my response literally and was very close to tears.  I can envisage doing exactly what I described, but to tease her, not as a punishment, and certainly not on the first night after we've been physically apart for six months.  My orgasms have also changed since katy and I became One.  Before our first 3D meeting, we played extensively on the phone and on ICQ - both of us having orgasms.  Since that first meeting, we play just as often when apart, but I rarely have an orgasm.  I have also found my desire to masturbate has reduced a little.  I wondered about this at first, wondering if my libido was reducing.  The next visit soon disproved that.  I suspect my desire to masturbate has been reduced by how overwhelming I find the reality of katy to be - 2D/cyber pales in comparison.

I look at the world and I notice it's turning While my guitar gently weeps With every mistake we must surely be learning Still my guitar gently weeps I don't know how you were diverted You were perverted too I don't know how you were inverted No one alerted you. I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping While my guitar gently weeps Look at you all... Still my guitar gently weeps.

      Master is coming to visit for Christmas.  He told me tonight that for a period of time before his visit, I will be denied orgasms.  He isn't going to tell me how long it will be (a week?  a month?) until it is time.  Then he will either tell me by announcing that I'm going to have dozens of orgasms that night but no more until his arrival.  Or by telling me just after I come "That was your last orgasm."  Of course the latter will be much crueler.  And he knows this.  I asked him if he would withhold orgasms for a weekend soon so I could practice.  He said no, he expects me to do my best without any further training.  I asked him what would happen if the touch or even the scent of him at the airport made me come without permission.  He said I would have to be punished.  I asked how he might punish me.  He described the cruelest thing I can imagine.  Tying me down with my legs spread, pulling back his foreskin, and fucking me with just the head of his cock.  Not filling me up.  Not touching my g-spot.  I cried out in anguish at the thought and begged him, "Not the first night.  Please, Master, I couldn't bear it, not the first night.  Not when we've been apart for so long."  I was almost crying at the thought.  No amount of submissiveness would allow me to bear such a punishment without tears.  He assured me that he would never do that the first night after a parting.  Which is good.  That's the first punishment he's ever mentioned that I think could cause an emotional meltdown if it was done on a first night.  But back to denial...  Master has not played much with orgasm denial for me.  During a scene, of course, I have to beg for permission to come, which he almost never gives the first time I ask (but not "never", as that would make him partly predictable), and on occasion he has told me I am not to masturbate or come overnight.  Once we did it for about 36 hours (not the full weekend) and when I finally was given permission to come, it went on at least 15 minutes.  But in general, in between phone calls, my orgasms are free.  The time zone issue means that Master has never requested I ask permission every time I masturbate.    But I rarely do, without him.  It just isn't the same.  I don't know whether I need his presence to be aroused, or if I am submissive to the extent that an uncommanded orgasm doesn't feel natural.  Or both.

       Master   Since finding freedom within her total submission to me, katy has been letting her inner slut out.  (With my complete approval and encouragement)  She often 'forgets' to put underwear on, especially on non-work days.  She sent this piccie to me during the summer.  *sigh* she forgot her panties.  Again.  I wonder what the neighbours thought?  ;-)     PS. Doesn't she have pretty legs?

      I asked Master during our phone call "Is there anything you'd like me to do tonight?"  "Yes," he said.  "Write something on our blog.  Write about what you'd like to do with me wearing leather chaps."  Is there anyone in readerland who has any confusion about what I'd do with my Master and leather chaps?    urlLink (here's a hint)    Since that didn't take long, I'll go on to maybe what I might fantasize about doing afterwards.  I have a very strong fantasy about Master wearing a leather cockring and me being leashed to it.  I plan to make one for him with leather and a snap, one that will wrap around both his cock and balls.  I'm just not sure exactly how to put a ring on it for him to attach the leash without it being uncomfortable for him.    I can imagine myself kneeling at his feet, with my head resting on his knee, inhaling the scent of leather and cock and Master.  Mmmmmmm.....  I've never had any fantasies about pony play, but I wouldn't mind having a decorative ass plug with leather tails to match Master's leather chaps.  But of course I'm a materialistic slut at heart, so my list of fantasies wouldn't be complete without nice leather clothes for me.  Perhaps this skirt:    with this bra:    Wouldn't I look yummy, Master?

      Master and I will be spending our first Christmas together (in 3D) this year with my family.  My question is:  Would it be more appropriate to wear a leather or a chain collar when opening presents around the tree?  Just kidding!  I'm absurdly happy right now.  No doubt I'll be wearing a necklace or a velvet ribbon that Master will place around my neck while I'm kneeling in front of him.  I will likely sit on the floor at his feet while the family passes out presents.  Master will probably feed me little nibbles of food, which will look unbearably affectionate to the others.  I haven't told him yet that my family's traditional Christmas Eve meal is hors d'oeuvres and finger foods, so the nibbling thing will be easily done.  I will try to think of other ways I can show my submission appropriately in public before he arrives.  We've had two visits together, and each day is more "Us".  I can't get ftp to work, or I'd upload  urlLink this picture .  It's the ornament I bought last year and sent to Master.  It has a place for a picture of Us together, but instead I wrote a note and slipped it in the frame.  The lock and key was perfect.  This year's Hallmark collection doesn't have anything that has struck me as being "just right" for Us, but I'm not married to Hallmark.  It can be any keepsake ornament, as long as it has the year engraved somewhere.  I want Us to collect one each year for all our Christmases to come.  I also read about a couple who always chose, as souvenirs, a Christmas ornament instead of t-shirts or promotional crap when they vacationed.  That way their Christmas tree was always full of reminders of the time they had spent together.  Does anyone know anywhere that sells kinky ornaments that aren't obviously kinky?  Like safe for vanilla observation, but would bring knowing looks from kinksters?  If so, please comment or email!  I want to do that with you, Master.  I love you.

       The wooden spoon    Master   Ah, the wooden spoon.  Freely available in Dollar Stores.  Indeed, you can often get a pack of three different sizes for a dollar.  The long handled ones are best, as the greater leverage gives more bang for the buck - as witnessed by katy's sore ass.  The long handle also makes it easier for katy to spank herself - an important consideration while we must still be apart.  Cost: US $1 for up to 3  Use: Spanking Results: Stings like hell - visual result can be seen below  Guaranteed: yes, unless you own a leather-hide sub

      A year ago, I offered my submission to Master for one weekend.  It was the first time I had submitted to anyone in that way.  It was also the first time I realized my feelings for Master:   katy: Master, will you tell me what you would do to your slutslave?   katy: How you would use your property?   Master: You are first restrained, spreadeagled, on your back .......    Cuffs on wrists and ankles - ropes leading away from them to permanent attachment points on the bed.    You are also blindfolded.    You have headphones on, playing something or other to pevent you from hearing what is coming next.............   Master: Shall I go on?   katy: yes, please Master....   Master: Once you are like that, I do absolutely nothing for an amount of time you cannot determine.    Building your tension and anticipation.    More?   katy: *whimper*   katy: .. please Master.... please go on   katy: I need to feel it, what it would be to be completely under your will   Master: I am a sadist - you are probably expecting a pinch, or a slap .......    What you get is a tickling sensation starting at one ankle and working *slowly* up your leg, inside thigh, over your belly (not touching your pussy),between your breasts (not on them) and onto your shoulders.    I am wearing a fur glove, although you cannot see it, of course.   katy: *moan*   katy: your slut is very ticklish, Master   Master: *g*    My gloved hand moves back down your body, avoding breasts and pussy again, working down the other leg.   katy: *gasping*  Master, please... mercy!   Master: The glove comes off now, and my fingertips trace the same route, slowly.   katy: ooh!  You feel your slut's body melt under your touch....   Master: I grab both nipples and twist and pull them.    Pleasure and pain, remember?   katy: I let out a cry/yelp as I remember....   Master: i kiss your nipples gently, cupping the breast.   katy: Time seems to stop as I lose myself in you   Master: You are getting a clearer idea of my playstyle - pleasure and pain, very sensuous, lots of biting and sucking.   katy: i want you, Master   Master: I want you to, masochistsubslut of mine.   katy: hold me.  please Master?   Master: Happily.    Gathering you close.    Stroking your hair.    Whispering "I love you, slut" in your ear.   katy: I love you too, Master   Master: I know.    I knew it before you admitted it to yourself.   Master: That was the arrogance showing, wasn't it?  *g*   katy: Yes.  You look into my soul.   Master: I try.   katy: and I would sell my soul for one kiss from you   Master: I know, that is why I must try and stay in control.    *nuzzle*    *relaxing with you now*    Just being together.   katy: yes   Master: Can you face the fact that there is an "us" now?   katy: yes   Master: Good.    Although what exactly that means is still undecided.    It is enough for now that we two are "us".    A small, locked away part of me wants to scream from the rooftops that you have chosen me, slut.  I'm so proud of you.   Thank you for accepting my submission, Master.  Thank you for making it safe for me to love and trust you.   Master   I have just gone back and corrected the typos in the above.  Typing in real time can result in some wonderful errors.  Yes, I was typing with both hands, you perverts!  Thank you for finding the courage to allow yourself to submit to me and be loved by me, pretty slavegirl.

      During my goodnight call with Master a few hours ago, I asked if he wanted me to do anything before I went to bed (he's 5 hours ahead of me in time).  He thought about it for a moment, and asked me to put away the laundry before I went to bed.  The housework has fallen behind, and Master is trying to help me catch up again.  He doesn't blame me for it, as I haven't had the spare time or energy to keep up recently, so there is no punishment.  Only encouragement.  But if there hadn't been extenuating circumstances, I would have been punished for letting the chaos grow, and rightly so.  The laundry is done.  I didn't have much energy left, but I spent a generous period of time carefully shaving my cunt.  My mons and labia get a quick swipe with the electric shaver every day, but I try to get all the nooks and crannies and the area around my anus at least once a week.  It was time.  Now everything down there is smooth and pretty.  Just the way Master likes it.    How do women with piercings down there stay shaven?  Or maybe they wax.  I don't have any piercings other than my ears, but we have two planned for the future:  My left nipple and my clit hood.  The clit hood is only a maybe, as it may be too small for a piercing, but Master wants to have me examined by a professional before he decides.  I am a little concerned about overstimulation, but I know he will do what's best for me.  But even a little clit hood ring would get in the way of shaving, so I will have to figure out how to do that eventually.  Master doesn't intend to put any more piercings in me down there, so at least I'll only have one piece of jewelry to work around.  I'm going to slip into the tub for a soak and then slip into bed.  I wish Master was waiting there to slip into me.  Ah well.

      To all the lovely readers who have commented on this blog:  Thank you.  Your feedback makes this blog a true joy, whether it is a thoughtful discussion of the kink or a simple compliment of my appearance.  Yes, I am a sub who loves external validation.  I also love that people are learning from our experiences, and  the thought that people are receiving pleasure from looking at pictures of me is a great turn-on.  The commenting system that we use doesn't notify us of new comments (we will upgrade when we can afford it, but right now, the expenses of getting Master and me on the same side of the ocean are the priority) so feel free to use the email link on the side to comment as well.    This lifestyle has brought peace and healing to my soul.  Writing about it, and reading what others have written, have added to my understanding and brought me great pleasure.  Thank you.

       Master   It would be no understatement to say that katy likes the material trappings of TTWD (This Thing We Do).  By that, I mean the toys, clothes and jewellery.  katy has several collars.  This one is made from heavy chrome chain, locked with a simple luggage padlock.  We have prettier locks, but the cheap one feels right with the heavy chain.  Early on in our relationship, I believe it helped katy to feel my presence by wearing something around her pretty throat as often as possible.  As time has gone on, we both know that she is collared all the time, even when she physically isn't.

      The day I was to meet Master at the airport, it snowed.  I allowed enough time to get all the snow off my car, and then I started carrying luggage to the car.  I was pleased.  I would be early, and have time to prepare the hotel room.  At some point, I left the door to the apartment ajar and Mutt took off.  I panicked.  She is not the smartest of dogs, and she doesn't have experience with crossing roads and such, as she's never allowed out without a lead or inside a fence.  And I live very close to some busy roads. And she wasn't wearing her collar and tags.  So off I ran after Mutt, following her pawprints in the snow.  Asking people who were shoveling out their cars if they'd seen her.  Eventually I returned to the apartment long enough to change into sneakers instead of dress shoes (I was in a skirt for our first meeting) and to grab a leash so I could control her if I found her.  The pawprints crossed over each other enough times that I gave up on that line of pursuit.  By then the snow was mainly useful in ruling out areas to search.  I kept calling her and eventually she ran right up to me like she was saying "Look Ma, no hands!" and I clipped the leash on her and hugged her tight and told her she was a good girl for coming when called.  During all the searching (about 30-45 minutes) I kept thinking  "What if I don't find her?  I can't leave until I do.  Maybe I can call the hotel and leave a message for him.  Oh no, the reservations are in my name.  Will they let him check in?  They have my credit card, surely they will if I call and tell them it's okay.  Or will they?  How could I have ruined our first meeting by leaving the fucking door open?!"  My "plenty of time to spare" turned into "no time to spare".  Eventually I got Mutt to the kennel and set off for D.C.  I made it to the hotel just in time to check in, and I saw that the airport shuttle was about to leave.  So I didn't even go to the room.  I simply grabbed my purse and one yellow rose from the bouquet I had bought for Master.  When I got to the airport, I changed from pantihose to thigh highs, and removed my panties.  I don't like the elastic tops on thigh highs--I greatly prefer stockings and garter belts, but I haven't been able to find a comfortable and well fitting garter belt.  Most of the ones I've found are just for show and can't handle a long day's wear with all the bending and twisting at the waist.  Apparantly they are more common in England, so we will go shopping over there when I visit Master there for the first time.  So my apparal for my first meeting with Master:  a long floral skirt, a black silk peasant blouse, thigh high stockings, and shoes.  I probably had jewelry on, but I don't remember what.  Of course I had a coat and hat for the cold, and to be sure he wouldn't miss me, had sent him pictures of me in both the airport outfit and the coat and hat.  Dulles has a section for international arrivals with a monitor.  It showed his flight as "landed" but not "in customs".  So I was shocked when I saw him.  I recognized him at once.  I didn't have the voice to call his name, and luckily in my confusion didn't scream out "Master!"  I just dropped my bag and ran to him.  We clung.  I smelled him.  He had sent me a t-shirt of his so I knew his scent.  He whispered "Cum now," in my ear, and I sank against him.    We touched and held each other continuously in between fetching luggage and calling for the airport shuttle to pick us up and waiting for it to arrive.  Since I had a long coat, he was able to grope me at will.  Me being cold-natured (and a slut) I was quite happy to be groped.  Some online couples are more careful when they meet for the first time and plan to just have casual no-sex meetings.  That was never an option for Master and I.  I left my hotel information with one friend.  I told my family (who doesn't know about the kink) that we would be in separate hotel rooms (my sister in particular was worried about me taking up with an ax-murderer).    We rolled the luggage cart completely into the room, and he surprised me by closing the door and pouncing on me.  No deep kissing, as he wasn't very fresh after the flight, but lots of biting of throat and breasts and cunt.  He attacked my cunt with his fingers and his mouth and then pushed his fingers into my mouth.  I'm pretty sure my stockings were lost by this time, and my blouse was untucked.  Certainly my hair was mussed and my face reddened from friction from a face that needed a shave.  And he ordered me to return the luggage cart to the lobby while he showered.  I don't know what the desk clerks thought, or if they noticed the difference between the me that went into  the room and the me that returned.  I didn't care either.  Actually, it was my first taste of freedom.  Of being  me .  It is a necessity that some of who I am can't be shared universally.  I wouldn't trust my family or boss with that.  But it is very good to be me in a place where there can be no negative consequences because no one knows or cares who I am.  Is that why there wasn't a moment of hesitation when Master ordered me to masturbate?  I used to only masturbate under the covers in the dark, preferably when X was sleeping or in another room.  If he saw me, or guessed that's what I was doing, he would laugh at me.  He was rarely interested in sex.  When he did get in the mood, he seemed to feel that, since I was a horny slut, I should be grateful, and shouldn't expect niceties like foreplay or romance.  In the last year, it was rare to have sex more often than once every 4-6 weeks.   I told him once that I thought sex twice a day would be ideal, once in the morning and once at night.  His response, "Are you trying to kill me?"  Master's response, "Unless one of us is sick, that is the minimum."  And during both 3D visits, he has held true to that with me being the one to beg for naps towards the end of the visits (and him teasing me unmercifully about that).    I gave Master the gift of submission.  But he gave me so much in return.  His dominance, his love, his physical desire, but most of all, the freedom to be me.  No wonder I had no self-consciousness when Master ordered me to masturbate.  I was finally loved for being--and loving--myself.

       Master   katy and I had our first 3D meeting this February.  My flight arrived at Washington's Dulles airport at 2 in the afternoon.  We didn't want to drive to her apartment because a) we didn't think we could keep our hands off each other for that long, and b) katy felt too nervous to drive (we didn't at that time know that I could drive her car on my UK license).  So we get to our hotel room and I immediately 'attack' her.  Nothing too serious as, after a seven-hour flight, I am in serious need of a shower and shave.  To say that I left her weak-kneed and dripping from her slave cunt, would be something of an understatement.  It was the first time she had been treated like the wanton slut and slave she is.  I then ordered her to return the luggage cart to reception.  She did, in something of a daze, while I got ready for the shower.  [Fast forward an hour or so]  Before we met, katy had expressed doubts about being able to masturbate in front of me.  Her previous partner had laughed at her because she likes to masturbate.  Interesting reaction from him, considering he hardly ever touched her.  Anyway, having thoroughly used her for the first time, I ordered her to masturbate while I took pictures.  She did it without hesitation.     What a difference a couple of hours makes.

       Katy:   The item two posts down is a self-massage tool known as the  urlLink Thera Cane .  All those little knobs are supposed to help you work out muscle spasms without creating more by trying to reach around your elbow to get to your ass.  Or something.  Of course, being a slut, I couldn't help but think that this would work better than my  urlLink improvised 18" dildo , if only because it wouldn't put my wrist in so bad an angle for repeated thrusting.  Usually with the 18" clear acrylic guy (which was originally a handle for some cleaning implement), I use one hand till my wrist gets tired, then switch to the other hand.  And sadly, have to give up before I'd really like to because the cunt indeed is willing, but the wrists are weak.    Even more sadly, the Thingie is on loan from a friend, so I don't feel as if I should be, er, "massaging myself" in ways not recommended by the manufacturer.  And bloody hell, these things are expensive!  But if it has both therapeutic  and  slutty uses, it should probably go on my Christmas list.

       Master   A good friend of mine has taken several years to come to the realisation that she is, in fact, a Dominant.  I have offered to share whatever experience I have with her.  Here is something I wrote to her a couple of days ago - some points that bear repeating:    Remember that you're the Domme.  You are not a fantasy facilitator for subs.  Someone once said to me that it wasn't very Domly of me to like eating pussy.  I explained that being a Dom is all about getting whatever I want, and if I want to eat pussy I damn well will!   Remember this.  You are, of course, primarily responsible for your sub's safety, but you are still the Domme, and should be doing what you want to do.  Your greatest satisfaction will come with a sub who wants to give exactly what you want to take.  Does that make sense?   Have you thought about how far you want to take the physical aspect of this relationship?  Have you thought about whether you want penetrative sex with your sub?  Most GuySubs enjoy giving oral sex to their mistress - do you want that?  Whatever you decide is right, but it is better to think about it and discuss it ahead of time.   Your sub seems pretty clear about what he wants from the relationship.  Has he had a Mistress before you?  Are you as clear about what you want?  It may actually be a good thing if he has had a Mistress before you.  It has often been said that the best thing a new Dom/Domme can do is to find themselves an experienced sub to play with.

       Master      We will, for now, call this object "The Thingie".  So, the questions:    What is its 'official' use?   Can any of you perverts think of unofficial uses for it?  Katy, who is in no way a slut *snigger*, has thought of a number of uses.

      And it leaves the nipples perfectly exposed for the symbolic piercing of the left nipple.     On the other hand, I think I prefer our idea of a leasther dress, with a removable panel over the left breast.  Yes, readers, we plan on having katy's left nipple pierced as part of our kinky wedding ceremony.

      Although we own many expensive and custom-made toys, we also have a collection of inexpensive playthings.  Here are a few of them.     Wooden spoons are an old favourite, great for spanking.  Hairbrushes are often overlooked for kinky possibilities.  Most of them can be used for spanking, of course.  Many of them also double up as a dildo.  Look at the curved handle on the left - that gets katy's G Spot just perfectly, after slipping a condom over it for hygiene purposes.  Then there's brushing her nipples immediately after you've been pinching and twisting them.  The results can be more than a little interesting.  Then there is the small leather cat o' nine tails.  I use it as a pussy whip.  Particularly effective when katy's pussy is wet from previous play - makes it sting more.  The final item is a leather sheath from an old knife.  Another good spanking tool.   Master

      One of the things that fascinates me most about TTWD (This Thing We Do), is the difference between what the vanilla world perceives, and what lurks beneath.  katy is my slave, submissive, lover, partner, slut and soulmate.  In everyday life (I don't say "real life" because BDSM is a 24/7 part of our real life) katy is a professional businesswoman who is respected by her colleagues for her skills.  She does, of course, dress appropriately (and in a delightfully feminine manner) for the office.  Her co-workers see her like this:     When she arrives home, she has a standing order to strip, although she is often in such a hurry to call me that she's in a tangle of clothes when I speak with her.  *grin*  A few days ago, she took a moment to take this picture before stripping:     Notice how lovely her hair looks as she lets it grow long?  Looking at my slavegirl takes my breath away.   Master

      One of the biggest problems with a bi-continental LDR is that we are together so rarely (for now), that the only sex we get is phone sex.  We're quite good at it, especially as I have trained katy to cum on command.  Like this:     The hardest part was timing the self-timer on the camera with my voice command down the phone.  *grin*   Master

      This is katy playing with my favourite flogger.  Although there are many strands, they are lightweight.  katy describes it as feeling rather like a massage.  I love the turned wood handle.  What you can't see is the bronze claw end, which finishes it off beautifully.     katy's hair is much longer now - she started letting it grow when I told her I loved long hair.  Her pussy is now hairless - I like it that way.

      It's when  urlLink communication between the sexes  gets complicated, that I'm glad not to be in a vanilla relationship.  See, when Master wants sex, he takes it.  And when I want sex, I beg.  We're never in doubt about the other's intent, and while we may occasionally have misunderstandings, they are never about sex.   Master's thoughts : katy, you forgot to mention that, despite our age difference (To readers: I am 12 years older than katy), I use you so often, that you have been known to beg for a rest, rather than more sex.  *kiss*

The prize: A digital picture, or series of pictures, posed by katy.  Choose anything you want - subject to the constraints of our kinks.  We'll tell you if you've gone OTT for us, and ask you to request a different subject.  The pictures will be taken during the Christmas holiday, when katy and I are next together.  Leave your ideas either in comments (with a working e-mail address), or e-mail us at captiveheart[at]cavtel.net  (replace [at] with @ of course).   Master

      In  urlLink Dan Savage's column  last Thursday, someone writes:   My fianc�e is having trouble going down on me. She can usually last five minutes before her jaw starts hurting. It's big--what can I do? When we try, she has me lie down on my back while she kneels between my legs. Is there another position that might work better and not cause her jaw to hurt? I'm about to marry this woman and I don't want to go the rest of my life without blowjobs.   Without Oral Enjoyment    Dan gave several suggestions, but the one thing he left off was to suggest that the fianc�e should ask her dentist if she has a  urlLink TMJ disorder .  If she does, then continuing to give blowjobs to a large cock will only make it worse.  I learned this the hard way and was forced to do without my recommended daily allowance of cock for several years.  This is a very bad thing for a slut who loves cock.  Thankfully, wearing a mouth piece at night for about a year has made me able to resume my slutty ways.  But I still have to be careful not to overdo it.  Chewing gum is out.  So is hard candy.  I still succumb to caramels, but never too many at a time.  And it really isn't that much extra work to cut an apple into slices rather than chomping away on it.    When Master and I started negotiating together, one of the first things we agreed upon was that my mouth should only be for Master's use.  Since he wants to receive blowjobs as badly as I want to give them, he will not gag me.  There's a kinky version of "you can't have your cake and eat it too"among Doms:  You can have the gag or the blowjob.  It generally refers to not being able to have everything at once, but in Master's case, if I wore a ball gag for too long, I might be impaired for weeks or months from giving head!  That's not good!  Even with all these precautions, I can't deep throat.  Never could, even with smaller dicks.  Certainly not with Master's large and yummy tool.  I can't even handle strong rhythmic thrusting for very long.   And yet I give incredible blowjobs.    My secret is that I am absolutely focused on giving pleasure.  If you have jaw problems like me that keep you from being mouth-fucked too long, or you just want to vary your routine, try some of the following tips:    Take breaks to lick and nibble  Practice using your tongue in different ways, from a flat, wet lick to a pointed probe, to everything in between  Blow on wet skin  Suck on just the head  Hands, hands, hands... everywhere and anywhere  Nuzzle and lick the balls  If you have long hair, drag it over his cock and balls  If he has a foreskin, tease it, suck on it, probe underneath it (I could write another post just on how to make oral love to a foreskin)  Run your fingers through his pubic hair  If you can't suck him from cold to orgasm, then mix activities.  He can fuck you until he's ready to come, then have you finish him off in your mouth.  Or you suck him as long as you can, then he finishes with a tit fuck.  Linear sex is dull.  Mix it up!  As Dan suggested, use your hand on his cock as a way of extending your mouth for his pleasure and your safety  Most importantly, love his cock.  If you love what you are doing, he'll love it too.       Sigh.   I wish I had Master's yummy cock in my mouth right now.    Wouldn't that be nice, Master?  Have I left any of my techniques out?

      I just got a new sofa.  It is much smaller than the old one.  I have lots of space in the living room floor now.  I can do yoga whenever I want, without having to move furniture first!  Naked yoga, of course.    I'm not quite clever enough with the camera timer to take pictures of myself doing yoga, but when Master is here, I'm sure he'll provide the assembled masses with many pictures of contorted katy.  :)

      I have reached a major milestone in my  urlLink book training .  I started a book on Monday night.  I read until bedtime, put a bookmark in it, and went to bed.  Tuesday I read some more, put the bookmark in it, and went to bed.  Tonight I finished it.  I read a book on three consecutive worknights, without staying up past my bedtime, anguishing about the book during work, or rushing through phone calls with Master so I could read.  Granted, it wasn't the most engaging novel in the world.  I purposefully chose it because it had a detached quality that I thought would work in my favor.  But now I know I  can  do it.  I can read novels when I choose (and Master permits) without having to block out hours of time.  I can  put them down  and attend to other things!    I strongly doubted this was possible when Master first expressed his concern about my reading habits.  It took me a long time to turn over control of it to him, and when I first did, I begged him to only give me books to read on weekends so I wouldn't have to endure a whole work day while in the middle of a novel.  Master had faith in me.  Master explained that by disciplining my reading habits, I would have more freedom to read, not less, because it would open up so many smaller chunks of time that aren't large enough to read a whole novel, but plenty large enough for a bit of escapism.    Master, I did it.  *fierce hug*  Thank you.

      katy, afterwards.     After what?  Yoga, you perverts!  What did you think I meant?  FURTHER THOUGHTS: After allowing katy a few minutes recovery time, I pounced on her.  Being a good girl, she immediately wrapped her arms and legs around me and gave me a big smile as my cock nudged against her pussy.  It was at that moment we both realised we were going to get carpet burns if we carried on, and so rapidly retreated to the bedroom, where a grand old fuck was had by all.   Master

       Master    The bloody time zones  The distance  The phone bills  Nobody to snuggle with  Nobody's hand to hold  Waking alone in the darkest hour of the night  No soft and round bottom to spank  Often nobody to talk to about,  well, everything  GoTo 1

       Or: I'll get the buggers' to leave comments   katy and I will be together in 40 days 10 hours and 39 minutes (although neither of us is counting).  We will be taking many new pictures while we are together.  We are also now taking requests.  I have one, from several months ago )sorry, I don't remember who), for a picture of katy's breasts after I've caned them.  Any other requests?   Master

      Yes, it's katy's - who else were you expecting?     She sent me this picture a couple of weeks before we first met.  I love spanking and caning, not to mention rear entry (including anal) sex.  Can you imagine how err, excited this picture made me?   Master

         The man in this picture is a candidate for governor of Mississippi.  Look at the imminent nipple pinch aimed at Mrs. Candidate!  Do you think he's one of us?  No word yet on the outcome of the election.   Update:  He won!  I hope she got a celebration spanking *wicked grin*

      It's obvious to me what a wonderful and loving person my Master is.  So when I see someone who should know better treating him badly and accusing him of being uncaring and selfish, it makes me angry.  It makes me want to shut that person out of his life because Master deserves better.  It makes me even more certain that I will never take his love for granted, or fail to be thankful for all that he gives me.  I love you, Master.

       Master   I have always enjoyed looking at a sleeping woman, especially if she's my woman.  A woman sleeping after hot, heavy and kinky sex with me, is especially beautiful.  Like katy, who takes my breath away.

       Master   I've been a good Dom all year.  Can I have one of these for Christmas?     The furniture, you perverts!  Imagine all the possibilities of playing with a sub in that position.  She's too low to be fucked easily, but you could easily insert a butt plug and dildo, slip on some nipple clamps, then fuck her mouth.  Any volunteers?

      Last night's play was intense and I went deep into subspace.  The general rule of thumb is that even if I appear recovered, I'm probably still not fully in touch with reality until I've slept.  When Master is away, we talk on the phone every night, and on nights we have heavy play, I often go directly to bed after the call ends.  I was completely ready for bed after our play.   Therefore, my befuddled mind thought of it as the bedtime spanking.  I had given so much and trusted so completely that I felt quite vulnerable.  But I wasn't close to being cognitive enough to say anything clearly.  There were two clues that Master might have seen (and this isn't assigning blame, this is something we looked at together to figure out how to avoid a repeat).  First, when he asked if I wanted to watch part of the movies, I asked if I could brush my teeth and take my bedtime pills first.  I wanted to be ready to go to bed as soon as movie watching was done, but hadn't thought it through clearly enough to say so.  Second, when we went into the bedroom, I asked Master if I could wear a t-shirt to bed.  I've told him before that wearing clothes helps to blanket the nerve endings of my skin when I'm feeling overstimulated.  I hadn't realized before that wearing clothes is also a subconscious way to protect myself when I feel vulnerable.    He asked if wearing a t-shirt would make my bottom feel better (I had mentioned several times how sore it was) and I nodded.  He said "That doesn't make sense" and I said "I don't know, it just will."  He gave me permission.  I walked into the closet and was reaching for a t-shirt off the shelf when he picked up the hairbrush.  I froze, dumbfounded.  "But I already had the bedtime spanking."  I said it several times.  He told me that the spanking before hadn't been bedtime, and that this was going to be very gentle.  I couldn't get past saying the same thing.    "Trust me," he said, and held out his hand.  This is the point where, had I been able to think, I should have said, "I trust you, but it's too much right now."  I should have asked him to hold me until I knew what was wrong.  Instead, my very fogged out brain got very confused.  I  did  trust him.  I knew the spanking wouldn't physically hurt me, much less harm me.  I just couldn't give any more.  Now he was asking me to give two things:  asking me to trust him and asking me to take one more stroke.  I had done that over and over, without him verbally asking, during the heavy play session.  Now, when I was wrung out, he asked it aloud.  Not asked, ordered.  I tried one more time "I thought I already had the bedtime spanking."  He said again, "Trust me."  Thinking in subspace is very black-or-white.  I was able to conceive of two responses to this:  either acceptance or rebellion.  Either I take his hand, or I say that I don't trust him.  The appropriate, nuanced response was beyond me.  Safeword?  It wasn't about remembering my safeword.  I didn't even remember the concept of a safeword.  I could see only two choices in front of me, and rebelling was impossible.  So I took his hand and broke into tears, accepted the very light tap, and then had a meltdown.  I'd given everything and was completely empty.  I cried.  Then we talked about it a long time--and believe me, talking about deep emotional issues is awfully fun when you're in sub-space and can barely string words together ;)

      Like last night, after the events katy blogged about in the post below this one.  What katy described finished at around 8pm -- too early for bed (or so I thought).  We crashed out on the sofa again and chilled in front of some more documentaries from  Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers .  Just after 9, I told her it was time for bed.  We went into the bedroom, and I told her it was time for her bedtime spanking (one of our rituals is for her to be spanked when she awakes, and just before she went to sleep).  She went glassy-eyed, and looked as though she was going to cry, and asked me why.  I explained that we always finished the day like this, yet she obviously didn't understand me.  Remembering that she was still in subspace from our heavy play earlier, I reminded her to trust me.  I did this because katy has several times in the past become confused after play and , afterwards, when we conduct a post mortem, she has realized that she forgot to trust me.  I assumed, based on the evidence past and present, that it was happening again now.  I again told her to trust me, bent her over the bed, called her a naughty slavegirl, and tapped her once (very, very lightly) on her left buttock.  Her butt, thighs and breasts had taken serious play earlier in the evening, and there was no way I ever intended to do anything more than a symbolic tap.  Everything was fine, right?  Wrong.  Katy started crying -- not hysterically, but certainly with genuine emotion.  We talked things through for almost an hour, and katy will post her side of it later today.  The root of it was that she had gone so far into subspace after our heavy play and she really wanted to go to bed at 8pm.  I hadn't picked up on it, as she had shown no signs of being in that place (it is usually very obvious).  I had reached what I thought was the right conclusion, based on current and past data, and had merely confused her further when I didn't understand what was wrong.  I am not trying to duck my responsibilities here.  Hell! I have a reputation of being a bit over-cautious in the kinky community.  I do think this is one of those 'shit happens' occasions.  Why?  Because I was doing my very best to supply good aftercare to katy, but misdiagnosed the problem.  katy did her best to communicate with me, but being off in la-la land, couldn't find the words.  So, shit happens.  We picked up the pieces, talked it through, and are ok -- stronger, because of it.  Further thoughts: this is also a classic example of why safewords have their uses (especially early on in a relationship), but it is dangerous to rely on them.  katy became so upset when I wanted to give her the bedtime spanking that she wanted to use her safeword.  She couldn't remember it.  Worse, she couldn't put into words that she felt that badly.  I could have done a better job, of course.  In my (slight) defense, I offer the fact that katy and I have had just 40 days together in 3D during this year, and so I am still learning to read her.   Master

      While I was at work, I asked Master if he would allow me to do what I do best when I arrive home.  He teased me and didn't say yes or no, but when I arrived, he ordered me to strip and fix us drinks.  We went into the bedroom and he gave me the choice of whether he was to lay on the bed or sit in the chair.  I chose the chair and knelt before him to worship his cock.    After dinner, we watched the documentary features of  The Two Towers  and he spent half an hour playing with my right nipple and periodically ordering me to come.  Which I did.  A hot bath followed, relaxing me completely and leaving my skin damp.  He told me to go into the bedroom.  I took two steps then fell to my knees and crawled.  He caned me--not much harder than usual, he says, but it hurt more.  I screamed once and thought I couldn't take more, but instead of saying so, I decided to trust Master for one more stroke.  I kept making that decision after each stroke.  Up on the bed for photographs and for Master to rub cream on my bottom, then surprise me with a few more strokes.  His hands, then the leather tawse, then the hairbrush.  "Up you get, wench," he said.  I slowly sat up and took his hand, then hugged him.  "I'm done using you," he said.  "Were you expecting me to fuck you?"  "I wasn't expecting anything." I said.  It was the truth.  Expectation requires thought for the future.    Another time he said, "Do you ever wonder how far this will go?  The masochism?"    I don't wonder often.  The masochistic place is too far from the part of me that is able to think and wonder.

      Today I had to work.  Master stayed home and wrapped prezzies while I tried to clear up the year end numbers.  We talked by icq all day, just as we do when he's on the other side of the ocean.  The difference was that he was home waiting for me.  I walked in the door to find the house dark, save for Christmas lights.  I couldn't see Master.  He ordered me to strip, then to crawl towards the bedroom.  He emerged behind me, flogging me with the riding crop, driving me into the bedroom.  He made me close my eyes and climb onto the bed, where he spanked me some more for his own pleasure, then had me roll over and spread my legs.  He entered me and fucked me hard and made me come.  Then he pulled out and came on my face.  This is the first time he's done that.  I didn't know what to expect.  Quite a lot of it landed on my mouth, but for technical reasons, it wasn't a good idea for me to taste it.  It felt much gooier on my face than it did when he came on my tits.  I wanted it to feel humiliating, but it didn't.  I wasn't deep enough for that.  Maybe because I didn't have my collar on.  Maybe because our visit so far has been more about Christmas than kink.    I was glad that he wiped my face clean soon afterwards and didn't make me leave it on.  I am glad that some of his spunk landed in my hair and made a few strands of hair stiff when it dried.  I wish I'd been able to taste it.  I wish the picture had turned out so I could post it.  This visit is the first time the sex has been less than perfect.  But never mind.  It's still better than anything I ever knew to dream of.  No more blogging until the weekend.  Then there will be lots of naughty pictures and probably very little text.  We're busy having our life.

      I made it.  I didn't come at the airport, or in the hotel room when Master ordered me to strip, or when I had his cock in my mouth and he locked the collar around me.  I almost came when he bit my ankle as he prepared to enter me.  But I was a good girl.  I didn't come until he ordered me to.  And then I came like mad.    I still think I got the better end of the deal.

      I still won't call the orgasm denial "frustrating", because to me that suggests that I feel mental strain over it.  I'm still very submissive and accepting.  But the submissive mind is in a slut body, and that slut body snuck out last night.  First in the dream, I was having sex with a friend of mine.  (A friend I've been attracted to forever, but never actually had sex with--he shows up in dreamtime a lot)  I told him that I wasn't allowed to have orgasms, and he got annoyed, because he wanted me to.  So I quit in the middle and said, "Never mind, then."  So far so good.  But later in the dream, I came upon a couple having sex and sort of joined in, rubbing my clit against his leg.  He asked her to put her finger in his ass to help him come, and that got me so excited that I started to come.  Then I thought, "Oh shit!  I wasn't supposed to do that!  Maybe I can stop it."  And I did stop it.  But then I decided (still in the dream, mind) that even though it was a small and interrupted orgasm, I still had to confess it.  So when I woke up, I did.  Master didn't tease me with talk about the scent of his cock on the phone tonight.  Is that a more subtle form of tease?  BTW, Master, of the 7 things on my list, I've now done 3 1/3 of them.  (The one third being laundry, which is washed, but not dried or put away.)  Time to eat.  The more, er, personal matter will be handled when I go to bed.  That leaves tidying the house, which I will do as much of as I can before bedtime.  I love you.  Tomorrow!

      katy's last err, life partner did not, so far as she could tell, give a shit how she dressed, or how she looked.  I, on the other hand, think she is a very beautiful woman, and tell her so often.  This causes us to joke about how she is turning into a girly girl.  She always tries hard with her airport outfits.  This is the one she wore in June this year.     She hasn't exactly told me what she'll be wearing in three days.  She's just told me on ICQ (not knowing what I'm typing) that the dress she's wearing this time is one I haven't seen yet!  She describes it as:   it's a little short for work, but i think you will like it.  i will leave it up to you as to whether it is to be considered disposable.   I love my slut.  Three days.

      This morning, we got out of our routine.  Usually Master calls me in the morning to wake me up.  This is so much a part of our routine that I haven't set an alarm clock for months.  During my wake up call, I get a wake up spanking.  This morning, I woke up first.  I called Master, got the voice mail since he was online, and logged on.  Somewhere in the confusion, both of us forgot the morning spanking.  We made up for that this evening.  Master had me spank each buttock ten times.  And he talked to me.  I never touched my clit.  I had the bullet ready, per his orders, but it wasn't necessary.  He had me on the verge of orgasm with only his words.  His magic tongue stroked my libido just as thoroughly as if it were here stroking me physically.  He took me to the edge, then withdrew me.  If I dropped too low on the 1-10 scale, he'd murmur, "You've forgotten the taste of my cock."  I can't help but moan.  I miss his cock so dreadfully.  The taste, the texture.  The sounds he makes when I burrow my tongue under his foreskin.  The sight of it above my face, a drop of pre-cum about to fall on me.    This visit, he promises to come on my face.  And take pictures.  Stay tuned.  4 days.

      In re-reading the post below, I realize I've left something out.  I'm not frustrated.  The deep pleasure and fulfillment I get from obeying Master is greater than the pleasure I would get from an orgasm.  I ache for an orgasm.  I long for one.  But at this point, I'm not feeling frustrated or resentful.  I'm not tempted to rebel.  Of course, 5 days is a long time for a blissful subspace acceptance to last.  I will keep you updated.  In the meantime, my bathroom is sparkling clean.  I even dusted the light fixture.

      Orgasm denial continues.  I wonder sometimes at the depth of my submissiveness.  Last night I had an erotic dream of having sex with a stranger.  Before I could come, he suddenly had to go to work.  He said he would call me so we could finish having sex.  I spent the rest of the dream waiting for him to call and trying to get through to him at his work when he didn't call.  So even in my dreams, I'm a good girl and didn't have an orgasm.  Tonight Master was very cruel.  He had me prepare my plug-in vibe then lie on the bed on my back.  He ordered me to squeeze each breast hard, then twist the nipple, then pull it away from the breast.  I'm such a pain slut.  I was at 8 on the 1-10 scale just from the pain.  Then he had me stop, and he started telling me a story.  He didn't know it, but it was one of my favorite fantasies back before I knew about bdsm or the kinky community.  In the fantasy, I am a party favor, trussed up near the door for guests to use on their way in.  I'm always tied up and usually blindfolded, and I'm used by one cock after another, usually with one in my mouth and one in my cunt.  In Master's version, I was in one of those sex swings I really want to own.  I was blindfolded, and a little bowl of condoms was nearby, as well as an assortment of toys for anyone who wished to cane my breasts or paddle my thighs.    He was halfway through the story before he had me turn on the vibe.  As soon as he did, I whimpered and told him it was too hard.  I was so close to coming.    In fact, I'm at an 8 right now, just writing this.  Master had mercy and didn't make me keep the vibe on my clit for long.  But for the next 45 minutes, he kept me between 8 and 9.9 just with his words and his pain.  Twice he made me touch my clit.  But it was usually just his words.  I begged him to have mercy.  To help talk me down.  He had me eat dinner, which helped a little, and then we talked a bit about my family, which was unsurprisingly effective.  But by the end of the call, he was teasing me again with talk of how he plans to wake me with his cock one morning during the Christmas visit.    I'm now at 8 1/2.  Before I started this post, I sprayed cleaner in the bathroom to let sit.  The combination of cleaning the bathroom and getting a lungful of cleaners is a pretty good anti-aphrodisiac.  So now I'll go and scrub everything down.  Surely that will get me below 5.  Why do I think I'm going to have a hard time going to sleep tonight?  5 days until my next orgasm.

      Katy told me this morning that she would love to hear the Naughty Girl fantasy from Teacher's point of view.  She was somewhat surprised when I said something like "That will not be as easy as you might think."  My explanation may not make much sense (it barely does to me), but it is the truth.  When I am weaving a fantasy for katy, I am not physically involved in it.  Sometimes, I barely even feel like the author.  Conductor would be a more accurate word.  It is as though each component of the story is part of an orchestra that is always available to me.  I am the conductor of them and, to a lesser extent, also the composer, but I am standing apart from them (as does the conductor of an orchestra).  So, although I create the fantasy, I am actually outside of it for all intents an purposes.  I am not a dispassionate bystander.  I enjoy myself, and almost without exception have a bloody great erection during them, but I am not inside the story.  Have I made that as clear as mud?  9 days.   Master

      Teacher caught me.  I was masturbating in the cloakroom of Teacher's office.  I thought I would be alone.  Well, except that I was thinking about Teacher, and I wasn't surprised when he opened the door and saw me... leaning against the back wall, my skirt up around my waist, one hand in my panties and the other pinching my nipples through my starched white shirt.  "Miss Drake!  What do you think you're doing?" Teacher asked in a calm tone.  I could hear the steel beneath it.  "I... err... I was just..."  I tried to put myself together.    "Come here, Miss Drake.  Just as you are," he commanded.  "Don't bother trying to straighten your clothes.  The other students know what a slut you are."  I obeyed.  My skirt was askew and one shirt-tail was hanging out.  Worse, I hadn't yet reached orgasm when I was interrupted.  I stole a glance down as I emerged from the closet.  I couldn't help smiling when I saw the bulge in Teacher's slacks.  Of course, he saw the smile, and I knew I would pay for it.  He marched me back to the class that I had skipped when I discovered Teacher's office was unlocked.  Teacher was right.  The students did know what a slut I was.  Especially the boys.  The whispering started as soon as I entered.  "Over the desk, Miss Drake."  Teacher's desk was always clean.  I obeyed, assuming the position I knew all too well.  But this was the first time I was to be punished in front of the class.  Teacher flipped my skirt up.  I couldn't help it.  I jumped.  I had expected the first stroke to fall, and instead had felt the crisp hairs on the back of his hand brush against my thighs.  "Do I need to make you hold still, Miss Drake?" Teacher asked.  He didn't wait for an answer.  "Andrew, Bryan, come here and hold Miss Drake in place."  I heard the class breaking out again in whispers and felt a firm grip on each ankle as the boys grabbed my legs and spread and lifted them, so that my feet no longer touched the floor.  From their position sitting on the floor, they could see everything.  Could smell everything.  Had my panties soaked through yet?  "Miss Drake is a dirty slut and needs to be punished," Teacher announced to the class.  "Bryan, take her panties down."  I felt Bryan's hot breath on me as he peeled my panties down to around my knees.  He pulled my leg closer to him, and I realized he was surreptitiously rubbing his hard cock against my calf.  A whimper escaped me.  "Count the strokes, Miss Drake," Teacher ordered.  Then the first stroke of the thick wooden ruler fell on my left buttock.  "One, Sir," I gasped.  "You are a very naughty girl, and you need to be punished," Teacher said, then swung again.  "Two, Sir."  "You need to be punished in front of the whole class to teach you not to be such a dirty slut."  "Three, Sir."  "And I will punish you, every day, if I have to."  And so it went, me counting each stroke and Teacher telling me and the class what a naughty girl I was.  My bottom grew hot and I struggled to remember the count while trying very hard to catch a view of the bulge in Teacher's slacks.   Please make me stay after school,  I begged silently.   Please, Teacher.  I'll be such a good naughty girl if you do.

      As katy said  urlLink here :   Since late October, I've known that I would be denied orgasms for an undetermined period of time before Master's arrival.   Simple enough, you might think, especially as we had spoken about it on a number of occasions over the last few months.  Katy has a strong desire to be a "good girl", and that is a strong part of the dynamic between us.  She is eager to please, and I am careful not to abuse the power that gives me over her.  She had several times said that she is also prepared to make sacrifices if I ask it of her and, although we have several times played with orgasm denial for a day or two, I have not otherwise asked her to do anything that she considers a sacrifice.  You may imagine my surprise, when on being told she was denied orgasms until we're next together (10 days away now - or would be, if either of us was counting  g), she went to pieces.  Indeed, I was so surprised that it took me a few minutes to recover and I fear I didn't handle it as well as I might have during that period.  Katy said she was expecting "I expected a phenomenal play session where he took me very deep before telling me not to come.", yet that is not how I did it in the past.  I suspect, as katy seems to, that her reaction was caused by a number of minor things that had her in a slightly vulnerable place and I hadn't spotted that fact.  So I must take most of the responsibility for it.  It is made  much  worse for me because katy (understandably) can't talk when she's crying.  Consequently, we have to hang up and get onto ICQ, because she can type when she's upset.  I hate that, it tears me up inside, because it make me feel like I am running out on her when she's in a BadPlace and that is abandoning my duty as her Dominant and partner.  We deal with it by getting back on the phone ASAP. After katy begins feeling better.  Once we are together, this sort of thing will be handled differently.  Katy has to get off the phone because she can't talk, not because she wants me to go away.  So, in 3D, we anticipate me snuggling with her while she cries, then we will talk.  That will be much better.  For both of us.  In the meantime, I wove katy a verbal fantasy while she masturbated last night.  She wasn't allowed an orgasm, of course.  She will write about it soon.

      It's bedtime now.  I spent a long time soaking in the bath, and then got the kitchen cleaned.  But I didn't get the other housework done.  I know, you thought it was a little overly optimistic.    If you remind me tomorrow, I'll write about our play tonight and the fantasy you wove for me.  I love you, Master.  I hope you are dreaming of me now.  Ten days.  *smile*

      Since late October, I've known that I would be  urlLink denied orgasms  for an undetermined period of time before Master's arrival.  He arrives in 11 days.  He told me this morning that the ax has fallen.  That he has had "December 6" in his PDA for several weeks as the day when I would be told.  I wish I could say that I accepted it graciously like a good slavegirl.  But I didn't.  I'm not normally rebellious.  I normally want so much more to be a "good girl" than I want any particular thing I might rebel over, including orgasms.   The problem I had today is that I haven't been in subspace in quite a while.  A combination of things (mostly it having been 6 months since Master and I have been together physically) has kept me from feeling as submissive as I like.  Then last night, I went into an emotional Bad Place on the phone with Master over something very silly.  Master hasn't been ordering me "Come now!" as often as he used to.   I expected something... different.  I expected a phenomenal play session where he took me very deep before telling me not to come.  Or perhaps him giving me a mind-shattering orgasm and telling me that was my last one.  Or something.  I didn't think he'd tell me first thing in the morning after a bad night.    So, I rebelled.  Sort of.  I cried.  I told him I didn't necessarily want him to change his plans, because I want him to be in charge.  It was sort of a rebellion because I didn't accept his plan wholeheartedly at first, but it wasn't really a rebellion because for me to have kept quiet and pretended to be okay when I wasn't would have been Many Times Worse.  I'm supposed to tell Master when I have mental misgivings.  Actually, it's a little stronger than that.  I'm under orders to keep Master informed of my emotional state.    Master decided to take some time to think about what to do and I realized later as I was running errands that it isn't often that Master gives me an order that requires sacrifice.  Normally submitting to him gives me far more pleasure than I give up.  So I asked him to please not change his plans and said I was sorry for crying and not accepting it.  I love you, Master.  I hope I haven't diminished the pleasure you will take in denying my orgasms.

      ..... when Master's 3,600 miles away?  On my birthday, katy sent me one picture for each of my years.  Here's one of them.     She was missing me badly that day and resorted to self-bondage.  Nowhere near as satisfying as Master restraining her, but better than nothing at all.  Isn't she cute?   Master   15 days.

      All other things being equal, I am a breast man, and this blog has many times displayed katy's wonderful breasts.  This is one of the first pictures katy sent me.     I took one look at her legs and thought "Wow!"  17 days.  UPDATE: last night, katy told me that the outift in the picture has gone to GoodWill, as she has lost weight and it no longer fits.  Ah well, she has other clothes that enhance her pretty legs.

      The table was a standard folding banquet table.  Master pulled it into the middle of the room and put a few blankets on it to make it into a massage table.  He had soft music playing.  Candles.  He takes such very good care of me.  He spent ages massaging me, and then we snuggled on the sofa for a while.  Then, being the horny slut that I am, I begged Master to take me.  I had to beg for a while before he indulged me.  He ordered me to bend over the table and restrained my hands behind my back.  Then he fucked me from behind.  Hard.  Very hard.  After his soft side being out earlier, he was letting his Beast out to play.  And I loved it.  Can you see what's coming yet?   (Hint:  not me or Master!)   One set of table legs folded.  We went down.    Since my hands were restrained, I couldn't catch myself.  Master tried to catch me, but he couldn't prevent the fall--only roll us to the side so he wouldn't crush me.  I could have been very badly injured, but thanks to Master, escaped with nothing more than a hard knock on the chin.  You could say it was a little bit of a passion killer.  Even for a slut.

       Master   When we last left katy, she was  urlLink thanking me  for  urlLink her caning .  It is fair to say that I like cumming in katy's mouth.  It is equally fair to say that we do humiliation play often, because it is very hot for both of us.  Katy feels particularly humiliated when I use her as my cum rag.  And she is such a beautiful cum rag.     The more astute among our three loyal readers might notice that she is wearing a blindfold, rather than the mask. I had taken the mask off her so she could watch me masturbate over her body.  This is  very  hot for her, as well as humiliating.  We couldn't find the mask afterwards, so quickly put the blindfold on her.  Well, we do keep  some  anonymity.

         I took this tonight for Master, but since his email isn't working because of the virus, I'll just give it to him here.  I know he won't mind sharing me with all of you.  :)  Per Master's request, I have the little tuft back.    Here's a picture from last November, when I was clean shaven:     Master likes both looks, so has me alternate between them.  Which do you like better?  Tuft or no?    And yes, I know this wasn't on the topics list, Master.  Does that mean I need a spanking?     Master : I'm assuming that was a rhetorical question?  You always need a spanking, slavegirl.

       Master   When we left katy, she was waiting for me to  urlLink cane her .  I am a sadist, as well as a Dominant.  Translates: my cock gets harder when I hurt katy.  So I caned her.  Hard.  Very hard.  Here's the result.     She dived almost as deeply from seeing the photograph as she did from the caning itself.  Any requests to see what she asked to do next, to thank me for the pain?

      Just before Master left, we encountered a minor disaster.  The foil on my electric shaver somehow developed a hole.  Luckily we noticed before accidently gouging a hole in delicate places--the blades under that foil are nasty!  I tried going back to regular razors while waiting for the replacement foil to arrive.  I have no problem at all shaving my labia.  But no matter how careful I am, how much shaving gel and special cream I use, I get massive razor rash if I ever shave my mons with a wet razor.  I get mild razor rash with the electric shaver, but it's manageable.  Can anyone explain to me why my mons is more sensitive than my labia?  I'd think it would be the other way around.  Anyway, the foil arrived today, and I can shave!  I can shave!  At Master's  request  command, I'm going back to having the little tuft of hair, as shown in the "on button" picture below.    It wasn't all bad doing without.  One up-side is that I realized with a wet razor I can finally get the area around my asshole clean shaven--something that's impossible with the electric shaver unless someone else is there to hold my ass cheeks open.  And speaking of my ass (and rambling completely off topic here, but who cares, right!), I'm back to working on training my ass for Master's use.  It's become very easy to slide a finger or one of the smaller buttplugs in there, but when I try to go from that to a fucking motion, the muscles clamp down tight.  I was disappointed that I wasn't ready for anal sex during Master's last visit.  But he tells me to be patient with myself and not worry about it.  Just relax.  I think I need one of the anal vibes on my  urlLink Naughty Wish List .  Would anyone like to help train me to be a proper ass slut?  *batting eyelashes*

       Master   I was gooing to make you wait until Monday for the next episode of the ongoing story but, having been begged prettily by three different femsubs in comments below, I have decided to put you a little bit out of your misery.  Feeling very submissive after crawling to me, katy begged to be caned.  Here she is on the bed, waiting for 10 strokes from each of the waiting canes.     I am very good with canes.  Very.  I can hit the exact spot, at the exact strength I decide.  I am kind, and this means I can hit between previous welts, so spreading the pain.  Would anybody like to  ask  for a description and picture of what happened next?  *grin*

      This picture was taken just after the one below.     My beautiful slavegirl loves to be made to crawl to me.  She especially loves it if she is made to beg for something at the end of the crawl.  It makes her feel particularly submissive and owned which, in turn, make her cunt wet [understatement alert].  If y'all ask nicely, my next post will be about what she begged to do at the end of the crawl pictured.  If all y'all ask  really  nicely, I'll include a picture.

      This is not the greatest picture of me holding katy by her leash, but it illustrates one of the central dichotomies of TTWD (This Thing We Do): that since she submitted completely to me, she has been free.  More free than at any other time in her life.     She has been submissive for as long as she can remember, and some people in her past have taken advantage of that in ways that make me angry to think about.  She was never free to express her sexuality (she is the most sexually 'alive', uninhibited woman I have ever known), her desires (in bed and out), her other wants and needs.  Now she can be herself.  This works both ways, of course.  I am now free to be what I am.  I have tried explaining that a Dominant is not something I do, it's something I am.

      I am a slut.  I have an On button.  As you can see, it's small and tucked away.     It's a very powerful little button.  When Master called me this morning, he caught me playing with it.  Of course, he had to "punish" me for being caught being such a naughty slut.  It's humiliating being caught masturbating.  It's even more humiliating being ordered to continue for his pleasure.  I'm his slave.  His fuckmeat.  I was made to pleasure his cock.  One day, I will pleasure other men at his command, knowing that it pleases him when I'm a slut.  Even typing these things makes me hot.  Humiliation play is hot for both of us, and it is probably my favorite play for phone sex.  I'm still trying to understand why I crave it so much.  I can't explain what humiliation play  is .  But I can say what it is not.  It is not about me having a low self-esteem.  And it is not about Master having contempt for me.  It wouldn't be arousing if I didn't know that he completely accepts and respects my sexuality--in fact, loves me for it.  It wouldn't be arousing if I was ashamed of my own sluttiness.  If this is a little fuzzy it's because I'm still in subspace after playtime.  But if anyone has any questions about humiliation play and how it feels, please use the comments or email either of us.  In fact, that's true about any part of the lifestyle.  That's one of the reasons we write here.

      katy sometimes, usually during intense play, goes to somewhere that we call the animal place.  Her powers of speech are lost, her intellect is A.W.O.L., and she makes some curious noises.  Animals can bite, of course, so I sometimes muzzle her.  This, if she is not already there, sends her straight to the animal place.  The disadvantage is that I can't fuck her mouth.  Ah well, I can't have everything.  Wait.  I've already got it.     She'd already had several orgasms when I took this picture -- that's why there's a flush on her breasts.

      Or: Last night, and why LDRs suck, reason #2,793.  katy always cries when we have to part at the airport.  She tries not to, in part because she knows how it tears me apart inside to see her cry.  I manage not to cry.  Just.  Only just.  katy didn't cry last Wednesday, although we were both miserable, and just barely holding on.  Parting sucks.  Parting at inhuman airport cattle markets sucks more.  I phuquing hate it.  We've (half-jokingly) spoken about what happened to the tears, wondering what happened to them.  We initially put it down to the fact that this time we had the knowledge that we would be together this summer.  Wrong.  They came last night, for no apparent reason.  katy has a Standing Order to call me if she needs me, whatever the time.  She was having trouble getting to sleep, and called me at 10pm her time (3 am mine).  She burst into tears quite soon into the call, and I hate it when I can't hold her when she needs me.  Summer.

      I wanted to write tonight about how it feels to serve Master.  Getting his drink, or ironing his shirt.  There isn't a long distance relationship equivalent of those things.  Service can also be done publicly--I often found ways of tending to Master's needs we were around my family that would look like nothing more deviant than devotion to untrained eyes.  I wanted to write about how it makes me feel when I hear him say "Thank you, wench" in a public place.  I have so much to say about it that I'll have to revisit this topic when I'm less tired.    I love serving my Master.

Ooh ooh!  An ice dildo!  I had a hairbrush fall apart and discovered the handle was hollow.

       Master   What katy forgot to mention about the leather gloves is that, at the time, it felt like she was being spanked by both my bare hand (which she loves), and by leather, which she also loves.  The redness on her right buttock in this picture is caused by it having just been spanked by my leather glove clad right hand.     PS.  Do you like the nice leather spanking skirt and leather boots she got for Christmas?  ;-)

      Back on December 31, Sara asked:   excuse me if I sound naive, but your relationship dynamic is so far out of my personal experiance that I have trouble fully groking it. katie, why did you have to ask permission to go to bed? does your submissive role really extend that far?    I realized after I read that question that I left some rather important information out of the story.  My bedtime is always 9pm if I'm going to the gym in the morning and 10pm otherwise.  Exceptions may be made for special circumstances, such as a special event with others that we don't have control over the scheduling, or genuine illness or insomnia (where I try to go to bed at the correct time, but lie awake for 30 minutes or more).  Exceptions don't include staying up for a tv show or getting tied up doing something on the computer and forgetting bedtime.  Bedtime comes, I go to bed.  No arguments.    Now, without this information I can see how the story might have looked extreme.  What if he hadn't given me permission to go to bed?  Is sleep deprivation for hours or days a form of play we use?  Maybe there are people who play with sleep deprivation, but I would consider that very extreme play, in line with breath play (which we also don't do).  For Master and me, our physical and emotional health comes first.  Before play, before pleasure.  We may sometimes disagree on the means of protecting our health, but never on its priority.  So Master would never keep me up past my bedtime without a very good reason.   In answer to your question, I never have to ask for permission to go to bed at the assigned time.  It's only if I want to change the schedule that I would need to ask.  (Another point which I'll develop more in a later post is how much Master and I enjoy me asking him for permission to do things, even when it's obvious to both of us that the answer will be "yes".  "May I go to bed now?" is much more gracious than "I'm going to crash--you coming?")

      Master posted  urlLink a picture  below of my well-caned tits and asked me to write about the experience.  But I can't remember it.  That sounds awful.  It isn't that I've forgotten our play during his visit, it's that so much of it has blended together in my mind.  I know that scene happened after Christmas, because it was at the mall during an after Christmas sale that he found that lovely collar with a heart and an S for slut.  I remember begging him to rub cream on my breasts afterwards.  I vaguely remember that the marks didn't show up right away, but when they came up later, he took the picture.  Master says that the nipples were more intense than ever before, though I think we surpassed that again a few nights later.  I ended up becoming afraid of the cane.  We're learning that for me, the pain is always subjective.  What Master considers a stroke of moderate force can be received by me as anything from a caress to blinding white-hot pain.  There were some strikes to my nipples that felt like being speared through the chest.  I don't remember if it was this night or another one that I first begged for mercy.  Master confirmed that I wasn't using the safeword, then granted me mercy.... after a few more strokes.    The memories are fuzzy for so many reasons.  Subspace, having a head cold that week, being lonely without Master.  Neither of us wanted to use our limited time together blogging as we went, which would have resulted in more detailed posts.  But that's okay.  After this summer, we'll have the rest of our lives for that.

      Of course he's physically away, but right now he's visiting family and electronically away too.  It's quiet here, and lonely, but I'm okay.  I just did my blog-maintenance-sub job and updated the links.  Sadly, Early Light seems to be gone and Screamer Girl hasn't updated in several months.  But we added a new one,  urlLink Cock Under Lock .  It reminds me of my recent experience with orgasm denial.    I've never worn a chastity device.  I don't really think I could and keep everything sanitary down there, though I've heard of subs with labia piercings that act as chastity devices.  Hell, I can't even wear regular pantyhose for long, because they hold in moisture and things get out of balance.  Which is why I just ordered some of  urlLink these  and  urlLink these .  I can wear cotton panties (or go without!) and still allow my yummy bits to breathe.    In my next order, I'll try out  urlLink this set .  Doesn't that bottom look spankable?    I'd better eat and shower, so I'll be ready for Master's use when he returns.

       Master   Not home, back.  Home is when katy and I are physically together.  It was heart-wrenching to part, after 20 wonderful days together.  This time, for the first time, it didn't feel like a visit.  It felt like we were at home, living together, and it had its ups and downs (mostly ups, I am pleased to relate).  It helped confirm what we already knew: what we have is real, and we can have a life together.  We will be together by this Summer, probably in the US.  More stories from our recent time together will follow.  In the meantime here, as requested, is a picture of katy's spectacular breasts after I'd caned them.

      I spank katy every day -- it is one of our rituals.  When we are together in 3D, it is done as part of the morning ritual where she sucks my cock while I collar her.  On work days, she wears one of a range of necklaces as her symbolic collar for the day.  I usually prefer to use my hand when I spank her, saving the tools for more complex scenes.  While we are apart, she spanks herself with a heavy hairbrush, under my direction.  For us, it is a really powerful way (emotionally even more than physically) of reinforcing the dynamic of our relationship.  Anyway. this is katy's lovely butt after I spanked her.  I don't remember the exact occassion but, judging by the preponderance of marks on her right side, I'm guessing I was standing to her left.

       Master  The Guardian  newspaper, here in Britain, conducted a survery of sexual pactices and relationships,  urlLink here .  Among its findings:   British people top the league for bondage in the bedroom, according to an independent thinktank.  The Policy Exchange will reveal on St Valentine's Day that British people are more likely to experiment with handcuffs than their foreign counterparts.   One is entirely unsurprised.

      Does anybody else find the restrained warrior look hot as all hell?     I can hear her saying "OK, you've got the chains on me.  Are you Domnant enough to make me submit to you?"  She's saying it with a sneer, of course.   Master

       Master   I am both a dominant and a sadist.  One of my favourite activities is to restrain pretty slavegirls and torture/use/fuck them.  I also like to surprise them.  The average slavegirl (if such a thing exists) tends to expect pain when she is completely restrained.  I play using a heavy (and heady) misture) of pain and pleasure.  I might, for example, put tight clamps on her nipples, then use a piece of fur to stroke her body.  Our three loyal readers will be unsurprised to hear that katy loves to be restrained.  It allows her to let go to the nth degree.  Perhaps because she has no control over what is done to her, so it can't be 'wrong', or 'naughty'.     In this picture, katy is wearing leather (we'll come back to katy's leather fetish at a later date) wrist and ankle restraints, her heavy collar and blindfold.  Chrome chains run from the corners of the bed to her restraints.  Additionally, soft rope connects he wrists and ankles, making any signficant movement impossible.  Sometime soon, katy will write about how she feels when she's restrained.

       Master   Forgets what?  That sassiness, while fun, is also punishable.  Like a couple of nights ago when she had sasses me during her working day, and again on the phone at bedtime.  So I had her put the EvilNastyClipofDeath on her right nipple.  Instant dive.  Instant submissiveness.  Instant good girl.  And a piccie for the assembled masses:

       Master   I am a breast man.  If, for example, a woman is naked, I will quickly scan her face, then give a much longer look to her breasts.  Pretty much the same if she is clothed, actually.  ;-)  katy has beautiful breasts, and exquisitely sensitive nipples.  I like that in a slavegirl.  Anyway, katy had never experienced a titfuck until she met me.  She had never even had them (or any other part of her) stroked by a cock.  I leak a LOT of pre-cum, which not all of my previous lovers have enjoyed.  katy loves it.  When I say "a LOT", I mean enough for it to provide enough lubrication to use my cock as a massage tool.  Yummy.  It also means we don't need lube for titfucks.  katy was, I think, mildly surprised by how intimate it feels.  Of course, the old spunk all over her tits thing seriously feeds her inner slut and naughty girl.  She almost almost has an orgasm with me when we do this, even though I am not stimulating her clit.  katy is also a tease.  She sent this piccie recently.  What do you think she was suggesting?     PS. She is wearing her heavy chain, non-public collar.  PPS. 27 days.

      Very early in our relationship, Master taught me to cum on command.    I just found the initial exercise he assigned me in an email:    Exercise 1:  Enhancing your orgasms.   You need to be relaxed yet horny for this.  Try thinking of the things we have done together.  I want you to masturbate as usual but, you are to get as close as possible to coming, then stop it.  Ideally, carry on touching yourself (away from the clit if necessary), but back off from the orgasm.  Once you feel you are in control again, return to the direct stimulation, again stopping short of orgasm.  Points to bear in mind:  1. Accidental orgasms are likely until you gain full control.  Accidental ones are ok - getting pissed-off with waiting and giving yourself one is a punishable offence.  2. For now, I will allow you to orgasm as soon as the second cycle.  3. The long-term aim is for you to go through the cycle 5-10 times before release.  4. The purpose of all this is twofold.  First to give you bigger, even more satisfying orgasms.  The second is to teach your orgasm control, as it may one day be required of you.  5. The very long-term aim is that, with training, some submissives are capable of orgasm on command.  Wanna find out if you're one of them?    Another exercise was to countdown from 10 to 1, aiming to have the orgasm at 1.  I was easy to train.  It only took a few weeks of exercises, plus Master's command voice, for me to learn to cum on command.   Next time:  the night of 397 orgasms

       Master   It is strange, and dispiritingly perverse that, as we approach permanent togetherness (30 days), some of the problems of maintaining an LDR (long distance relationship) are becoming greater.  Is it so unreasonable to expect them to lessen?  It seems that we both have become more sensitive to the loneliness, the ache, the rolling over in the night to a cold and empty bed.  We are both world class at talking through problems, and this has helped make us best friends, as well as everything else we are together and that is getting us through.  30 days.

      I am a kind Master.  Not only do I cane katy until she squeals (and beyond), I sometimes provide her with a salve for her burning ass cheeks.  I usually fuck her hard from behind after I cane her.  Sometimes, if she has been an especially good little slave girl, I will pull out and cum over her ass, then have her massage it in with her own hands.  This is humiliating a.k.a. HotAsAllHell for katy.     Here she is just afterwards, when I also had her touch herself.   Master

       If you're a woman, wait no longer for that engagement ring-- today, Sadie   Hawkins day, is your day to propose marriage. This tradition originates in   Ireland in the 5th century, when St. Bridget convinced St. Patrick to allow   one day that a woman could propose.  If the man refused, he was fined   (incidentally, St. Bridget proposed to St. Patrick that day; he said no).  1,600 years later, the fine has been ousted (who's idea was that?), but women   still have only this one day every 4 years set aside to profess their love   and commitment for the men in their lives.    *from  urlLink @ February 29       "May I marry you, Master?" I asked.  He said yes.  I'm the happiest slavegirl in the world.   Additional from Master   Will you cry when I, your Master, go down on bended knee, ring in hand, and make the proposal official in 3D?  I have been looking at rings:

       Master   In my last post, I mentioned that katy chose having her breasts caned as a reward.  I suspect that only a masochist would have made such a choice.  More so, as she had just had her ass and inner thighs caned.  The marks don't show up that well on camera, but I thiught our 4 loyal readers would appreciate another picture.

       Master   I sent katy to work today -- I need a rest.  Perhaps I am getting old?  Perhaps not.  To say that everything is wonderful would be something of an understatement.  We had only managed 40 days together between the time we met and now.   We were as sure as we could be that we are One.  But, you never really know until you start trying to live together and make the reality work, do you?  Well, I know it's only been 4 days, but things could not feel more right.  We aren't just doing the giddy in love thing, we're also do mundane ever day things, like putting the trash out, mucking out the stove etc.  In other words: we're living a real life together.  No apologies for sounding mushy.  We are, of course, being perverts together.  ;-)  Last night, I caned katy's butt, hard.  25 strokes from each of 6 canes - two of them double canes.  i then told her she could choose a reward, for being such a good girl.  You know what?  She chose to have her breasts caned.  She's no masochist, is she?

      I tried to explain to Master how I could be totally nervous about today, and yet not have any doubts or fears.  The closest I could come was relating it to stage fright.  I'm not afraid of public speaking in the sense that I'm scared I'll forget what to say, or that the audience will hate me.  But I always have the jitters just before.  Master said, "Ah, it's performance anxiety.  You're afraid you won't be able to get it up."  *snicker*  Well, not exactly.  I want everything in our home to be perfect, but I know it won't be.  So I'm not really sure where the nervousness is coming from.  Anybody out there want to take a stab at defining it?  I'll be leaving for the airport soon.  Don't expect any more posts today.  ;-)    btw, isn't our little countdown script cute with its grammar issues? *giggle*

       Master   Who asked:  Is it permissible to ask things like....how are you going to do it? What about work? Are you bringing everything you own? Are you staying forever? Are you getting married? What about kids? Do either of you have any? Want any? Going to get a new place to live together or keep the old one?  Um, just stuff like that :)  Well, we can't answer that in detail without giving away alot about who we are in the real world.  What we will say is:  We are both divorced.  We intend to marry (having one vanilla and one kinky ceremony).  katy has no kids, I do, although some have already fled the nest.  We don't want kids.  katy moved within the last year and we don't plan moving again for now.  As for everythinhg I own?  I walked away with personal possessions (plus laptop and books) only when my marriage ended.  No regrets.  So I don't have much to move.  Just to clarify: my relationship with katy postdates the end of my marriage.

      "How does it feel when I cum in your mouth?" he asked.  I thought about it, hesitated, then suggested I blog it later.  "Just tell me briefly now."  "If I do, I'll go deep into subspace.  If I do, I won't get much done around the house tonight."  (The choice is always his, of course, but I was giving him all the information so his choice would be informed.)  So I didn't talk about it then.  I got things done around the house and waited until now to write.  First, there's the lunge.  Since I have TMJ, I can't deep throat.  I use my hand to act as an extension of my mouth so that his whole cock is being stimulated, and Master is careful not to fuck my mouth too hard if my hand isn't there to act as a safety block.  But as soon as he starts cumming, I can't help it.  I drop my hand and lunge onto his cock, trying to take it as deep as I can.  It's instinctive.  Master told me tonight that he wants to come over my tongue sometime, but I think for that to happen, he'd have to be enough in control just before his orgasm to order me not to lunge.  Even then, I'm not sure I'd be able to stop myself.  There's something deeply satisfying, in a way that's both submissive and potent, about feeling a cock pulse and twitch in my mouth.  Feeling the hot spunk in my throat.  Swallowing and consuming what I've drawn from his body with my lips and tongue and hands.  Sometimes I think of fellatio as a sacrament, on my knees before a holy altar.  Sometimes it feels like he's feeding me, giving up some of his own life-force to nurture me.  Much less common--even though we love humiliation games--it feels naughty.  But usually, whether I've been a holy priestess or a dirty whore in our play until then, the sacred and the profane disappear when his cock touches my mouth.  I become nothing more than an object, with no shame attached.  In that moment, I exist only to please his cock.  My mouth, my body, my entire being is focused on nothing more than sucking the spunk out of him.  And when I finally do?  When Master cums in my mouth?  How can I describe it?  How can I put into words how it feels when my soul, intent upon a single goal, suddenly achieves its purpose?    The closest word I can find is "complete".  I feel complete.  I feel peace.

      It having just occured to us that we didn't have a line in the budget for condoms, I went surfing to find a cheap source for rubbers in bulk.    Wow.  There are a lot more condoms out there than I knew about.  That's what i get for relying on the "family planning" corner at WalMart for my consumer information, where the only choice is whether you want your Trojans with spermicide or without.  Anyway, consider me intrigued.  I'll be ordering the  urlLink Super Mighty Mix , a large assorted pack for a great price.    I did get a giggle out of the  urlLink Hot Rod condoms  with the Speedstrip Applicator.  Enables you to put on the condom in 1 second flat.  I admit, I can't apply a condom that quickly, but surely the Slutstrip Applicator has compensations to make up for taking a few more seconds.  Oh wait!  I've got it.  It's for Master to use when I'm tied up.  Maybe I'll add them to the shopping cart after all.  ;-)    (11 days)

       Continued from  urlLink here    Having been limited to phone sex for most of our relationship, I don't think either of us will miss it.  I can't deny, though, that we were very good at it.  (Being able to cum on command might have something to do with that...)    Master enjoys saying the magic words when I'm doing things completely unrelated to sex.  Like making dinner.  (So far I've managed to avoid spilling boiling water on myself or slicing off my thumb.)  I usually will be ordered to come at the conclusion of the morning spanking, as well as during it.    Then there was the Night of 397 Orgasms.  Master has teased me for not writing about it yet, but the truth is that it's all a bit blurry.  I  think  that we weren't using the bullet that night--just my hands and his words.  What I do remember is begging him to let me stop coming.  I begged and begged.  I said "Mercy"  (BTW, "mercy" isn't my safeword, but it's a signal to Master that I'm very close to the edge)  He'd tease me.  Back off.  Give me a few minutes to catch my breath.  Then say the words again.  And again.  And again.  And I'd beg for mercy.    Again.    And again.  And again.  I somehow survived that night.     (11 days)

       Master   katy was in somewhat of a rush to get off the phone at one point yesterday.  She was in the bath at the time we were talking.  Today, she sent me a picture of why.  She wanted to shave her pussy, save for the small bush of hair I like her to keep.  This gives me the best of both worlds.  Her labia are smooth and bare, and I don't get hairs in my mouth when I eat her pussy -- something I love to do, especially just after I've fucked her. But, there is still some sensitive hair for decoration and for me to play with.     Some years ago, someone I later came to recognise as a Dim-Dom-Wannabe, told me that my desire to eat pussy wasn't very Domly.  Bullshit!  A major part of being a Dom is that I get to do, and order katy to do, whatever the hell I want.  So, as I love eating pussy, I do it alot.  Not that katy's complaining.  12 days.

It's difficult to take pictures while I'm spanking her.  Perhaps we will have to find some local kinky friends to help us out with the photography?  Any volunteers?  PS.

      I wonder if the pretty neighbor on the other side of the wall from my computer can hear the spanking sounds of the videos I'm streaming?   If she can, I wonder if she thinks it's me being spanked?   Will she blush the next time we run into each other in the parking lot?   Does she have a secret wish, just below the level of conscious thought, to be pushed over a man's knee, have her skirt flipped up and her panties pulled down, and spanked to tears?   I can imagine Master spanking her.   Or perhaps... she doesn't want to be spanked at all. Perhaps when she sees me in the parking lot, she imagines having me over her knee....

      We just added  urlLink Mistress Matisse  to our blogroll, and I showed this piece, from April 7, to Master:   So there I was, sliding this metal rod into his dick, thinking, "What a magical thing this is." And that�s how it seems to me when I'm playing � like it's magic. Like I'm magic. I love that I can do these intense things to people's bodies, and somehow, through some alchemical transformation, it's not a bad thing. Instead, it's wonderful. That's where the power comes from, for me. Not in making people endure something nasty � that's just bullying someone. No, the magic is doing fierce things to people and making them like it. That's the magic.    And asked him if that's what he feels when he hurts me.  After he finished cringing at the image of the metal rod being inserted (he's not even a little bit masochistic!), he said yes, that describes it better than he's ever been able to put it.  And that made me feel magical, because I've never quite been able to understand what he gets out of it.  I couldn't do to someone else what he does to me--not without great effort and very little enjoyment.  Master is incapable of getting any kind of pleasure out of receiving pain or being bound.  But together.... as the Mistress says, it's magic.

      I wish I could meet Master at the airport in leather and chains.  Instead, it will probably be a thin spring dress.  Stockings.  No bra.  No panties.  High heels.  (If it pleases Master, of course.  Although he usually lets me choose my airport attire.)  I'll wear a pearl necklace, but I'll take my collar and beg Master to lock it around my slave throat when we get to the car.  Since he'll be driving, he'll probably order me to play with myself.  I wonder if he'll order me to bring the bullet?  Or the pussy whip?  Or both?   Master

       Master   Our three loyal readers will have noticed how much katy likes leather, especially dressing up in it.  It helps, of course, that she has the body for it.  Yummy!     She is wearing her formal leather collar in this picture.  She only wears this when we're together in 3D -- the above picture was taken at Christmas.  She has become quite a leather slut since we got together.  She loves the feel of it, the smell of it and, given the number of whackers and slappers I have made of it, the slappy/thud of it.  19 days.  If either of us were counting.  Which we aren't.  That is obvious, surely?

      katy has beautiful soft hair (on her head, you perverts!), but it was very short when we first met.  I told her quite early on that I love long hair on a woman, and enjoy brushing it.  Six months ago, katy told me she was going to ler her hair grow long again.  It grows quickly -- this piccie is a couple of days old.  Yes, once you've finished looking at her lovely breasts, you just need to look up a little.     PS. 21 days.

      Can anyone (Invidia?) help me with a submissive protocol question?  The submissive is typing a kinky post, and the Master looks over her shoulder and asks what she's doing.  The submissive wants to keep it a surprise.  What's the submissive way to say:  "Fuck off--you'll see it when I'm done!" ?

      I only have to look at katy's lovely legs and they will bruise.  Her butt, however, is an entirely different matter.  It takes some serious effort to mark it.  Fortunately, I have canes.  I like canes. katy likes canes.     But, you know what?  An hour later, katy's butt looked like it hadn't been touched.  [long suffering, yet Domly, sigh]

      Master was reading the comments below and he saw a little broken graphic x next to each one.  "Eh, what's that?" he said, and clicked on one of the x's.  Oops.  It turns out that if the graphic hadn't been broken, it would have been a trashcan.  He ended up deleting the comment, and as far as we can tell, it can't be recovered.  Which is why you get the ominous:   Anonymous said...  This post has been removed by a blog administrator.   So I went back to my email and found the original comment:   I had always worried about that activity...afraid of the pain. When it finally happened...I was amazed at how much I actually liked it....Now, I beg for it when I am with M. He told me I would become an anal slut.......lol. He was right! Glad things worked out for you and that you enjoyed it too!    That is a very nice comment and not at all something we'd administratively delete. :)  (We love comments... keep them coming!)

      In  urlLink March 2003  I wrote about some of the trouble I've had with anal play in a post about playing with a butt plug.  In  urlLink November 2003  Master wrote about when he first actively lusted after my ass.  In  urlLink January 2004 , I wrote about how disappointed I was that my ass wasn't ready to be fucked during Master's Christmas visit.  Someone wrote (on a blog that is now sadly defunct) that instead of training, I only needed to relax.  I've been reading the book  urlLink  Anal Pleasure and Health   by Jack Morin, and though he gives exercises to promote anal pleasure, they are intended to help relax those muscles.  Ironically, by focusing so hard on those exercises, I was just increasing the tension.  Every time I failed, it increased the stress level and tightened up those muscles.  Master and I decided to discontinue the training.  Instead, he told me he would take my ass when he felt it was right.  He would give me lots of orgasms and put me deep into sub space and play with my anus until it was relaxed.  And then... he would just slip it in.  And that's exactly how it happened.  I was supposed to be going for a nap, but I was feeling needy, and I begged him to hurt me.  I don't remember what he used.  His hands, I think, and one of the riding crops.  He had me roll over on my side and he snuggled up behind me.  I was using the double bullet--one in my cunt and one on my clit.  I could feel his hard cock resting between my ass cheeks.    "Relax," he murmured as he adjusted his cock.  "I'm not going to enter you.  I just want to press up against you."  The head of his cock pressed against my anus and it felt good.  We rocked together, and I could feel that the head of his cock was sliding inside my outer sphincter.  I couldn't push back without fear of injuring him further (how I injured Master's cock is a topic for another time).  I moaned and he told me I was a good little bitch.  It could have been minutes or hours.  (He told me later it was about 15 minutes.)  At some point, the pleasure in my ass grew intense, and I suddenly had to turn off the bullet on my clit.  I think it was an orgasm, but it was a very strange one.  It must have been using different muscles than normal.    "Katy," he murmured.  "My balls are touching your ass."  I hadn't realized it.  Somehow I had Master's entire 9" in my very tight virgin ass, and I barely felt it.  The muscles were so relaxed.  Apparantly most of the nerve endings are in the inner and outer sphincters.  I couldn't feel the part of him that was beyond that--at least not directly.  It was more of the pressure that I could feel against my cunt, and it's buzzing occupant.  I did feel  him cum inside me, although it may have been the pulsing at the base of his cock that I felt.  Since his cock is still healing, we haven't repeated the experience.  Invasions with his fingers have proven that we've had a genuine breakthrough--it wasn't a one time fluke.  He says he might make it normal practice to use my ass.  That he might save fucking my cunt for a special treat if I've been a very good girl, or if I've begged prettily enough.  That was exactly what I was afraid of before he took my ass.  Now that he has, I want it more than anything.  I've felt more submissive since then--something I hadn't guessed was possible.  I've been getting butterflies whenever Master calls me his "good little bitch".  I hope that his cock heals soon so that he can take me again.  Harder.  I want to be fucked in the ass when I'm tied up.  I want him to flip up my skirt and bend me over the sofa when I've just arrived home from work.  I want him to use my ass whenever he pleases, and without regard to my pleasure.  I want him to fuck my ass while another man fucks my cunt.  I want him to fuck my mouth, cunt, and ass in the same session.  Thank you Master.  Thank you for being patient with me.  Thank you for knowing when I was ready, even when I didn't.

       urlLink Cunning Linguists  seems to be recovered from it's nasty bout of being hijacked by circle jerks, and I haven't had any other problems with the top lists, so back they come.    Hairbrush Action seems to be missing.  If its author is out there and ever returns to blogger, please drop us a line!  You were one of my regular stops!  And since Master just pointed out that the last run of posts on this blog have been administrative in nature, I will write after dinner about losing my anal virginity.

      Apparantly there's a top-list hijacker out there, because the link to "Cunning Linguists" sent me into the same rape/incest pop-up trap.  They've been around forever and never had this kind of icky behavior.  Does anyone know what's going on out there with the top lists?  I'm going to take down our toplist links until it seems safe to put them back.

      We just removed "Best Bondage Links" from the sidebar because it suddenly turned into a link for "Violent Family Rape" links and continued to spawn pop-ups until I hit alt-F4 about 100 times.    We apologize if anyone else ran into this and was either offended by the content, annoyed by the pop-up traps, or both.  The last time I clicked it, it was a perfectly respectable bondage top list.  While I'm (fairly) sure that the rape and incest sites were not actual rape or incest, it really has nothing to do with our kink and we'd rather keep captiveheart focused on BDSM.

      [Rhetorical question alert]  So, I had spanked her, then fucked her pussy and ass, while torturing her nipples.  I then came all over her lovely tits, which is always good for making her dive deep into that slutty/subby place.  I get off and begin to clean up.  When I look back, I see this:     Yes, after all that, and many orgasms, katy was playing with herself.  I have a more err, detailed view of the above piccie, although I don't suppose anyone's interested in seeing it, are they?

      Last night, a storm moved through the area, so M and I went out on the  patio to enjoy it.  We sat under a blanket to keep the rain off, and it  wasn't long before I shed my t-shirt, which was my only piece of clothing.   There's something about feeling the spray of rain on skin, about being  exposed to the elements.  If it had been full dark, we would have made love  out there, but the risk of being seen by one of the approximately 6,000  children who live in our complex was too high.  Instead, M touched me under  the blanket and drove me wild with his fingers and his murmured words,  while the lightning tore open the sky.

      M ordered a cell phone for himself today, and then went looking on ebay for  accessories for it.  He showed me what he'd ordered for it, and I said I'd  love to have another charger to use at work as well as a headset with a  boom mic.  He went looking, found the pieces for my phone, and placed the  order while I was busy telling him that the shipping was too high and I'd  done without for this long, so.....  I love you, M.

      I'm in a mentally weird place for various reasons--one of which being a business trip that will take me away from Master for four days.  Anyway, I started getting impatient with him asking me questions that I didn't know the answer to, and finally exploded in a growl and asked him to give me a moratorium from having any questions directed at me.  Unfortunately, his style of patter depends so much on the asking of questions that it is effectively gagging him.  And I'm trying to steel myself up for being spanked with The Beast later (for something that happened earlier), so now we're both in weird, growly moods.  Part of the lifestyle, but I wouldn't be vanilla for the world.

We had a host in mind, but after a careful perusal of the tos, realized they don't allow adult sites.  (Does anyone know a good kink-friendly host with affordable bandwidth?)  We had about given up on Blogger, but after their changes made them so much easier to use, we've decided to stick with it.  We'll just be publishing the blog to our own space, but with the added flexibility to design non-blog pages.  So please change your bookmarks to our new address.

      I am a morning person, but I hate waking up.  Once I'm awake, I'm okay, but I hate the actual process of waking.  This is where having a Master is a Good Thing.  When we were apart, he gave me a wake up call every morning.  I would whimper and beg for a few more minutes, and he would call me back a few minutes later.  This might happen several times, but once 6:30 arrives, he'd order my sub ass out of bed.  Now, we actually have to set an alarm.  (Which I can't hear, because I have to wear earplugs to sleep through Master's snoring, but that's another post...)  Master gets up right away, makes a nice cup of tea, checks his email, perhaps does a bit of surfing.  Then he comes to wake me.  I still whimper and beg for a few more minutes, but now he can add a few swats with his implement of choice to help me along.  Then there was this morning's solution which was very effective:  "May I have a few more minutes, Master?"  (this was maybe the third or fourth iteration)  "No.  I'm going to fuck you, instead," he replied.  I was lying on my stomach.  He grabbed my hips and pulled them up until I was on knees and shoulders and thrust into me.  He fucked me hard, came quickly, and ordered me out of bed.  I didn't come.  He didn't care.  I loved being his object.  And it did wake me up.

      Thanks to the yummy new  urlLink Blogger profile  feature, I'm finding other BDSM bloggers.  I'm always looking for more blogs by men and/or tops.  Nothing against female subs, but I am one, so I know what that's like.  I love getting a glimpse into the mind of a Dom.  It's really fascinating.  "Journeys of a Bondage Top" is a brand new blog, but if the author sticks with it, it may find a place on our blogroll.  If Master approves, of course.

      Do you respond:  1. By looking annoyed, and telling me to "Fuck off!" 2. Ask "How high?" then jumping 3. By jumping immediately 4. By yelling "Yes, Sir!" while at the same time jumping 5. By yelling "How long do you want me to stay up, Master?" while jumping  If (5), apply within.   Above required on a t-shirt for me.

      Blogger has comments now!  Unfortunately there was no easy way to transport enetation comments over, so all the old ones were lost.  :(  I  love  the new profile feature though!  Click on our names to the right, and you'll see our profiles.  Then when you see the list of interests, click on any of the words and you'll get a list of other blogs writing about them.  This is still a work in progress, as Master does not approve of me abandoning my regular duties to play with blog templates for the next 72 hours or so (which would be my inclination--I'm quite the obsessive slut). Comments on template changes, or on any other topic near and dear to your heart (except viagra or mortgage refinancing) are welcome.

      I am a masochist.  Not only do I need to be spanked to reinforce my submissiveness, I also crave the sensation.  Master has used many different implements on me, including floggers, riding crops, canes, hairbrushes, wooden spoons, as well as any random item within reach that he thinks will be safe and effective.  Until now, we hadn't had enough 3D time together for me to compare the different implements.  Usually I'm in subspace during the application of said implements, and it is difficult to quantify a subjective experience like pain.  Now we come to the varnished oak paddle:     Often, when Master is spanking me, he'll have me say something to him with each stroke.  Usually I'll say things like "I am a very naughty slavegirl" or "I love you, Master".  Two nights ago, I was surprised to hear myself saying "I hate that fucking paddle!"  Of course that earned me a few more strokes that night, and they were so hard that I ended up using my safeword.  (Since I'm a masochist, I hardly ever do this.)    Last night, he used the varnished oak paddle again.  First, I said "Mercy" (which is not my safeword, but a beg word that means I'm near the edge of my endurance).  Master gave me a few more strokes, and I cried out "No more!"  That is similar to my safeword of "too much", but I couldn't get the words out right.  Master knew what I meant.  We snuggled and Master teased me about why someone who can take a 150 strokes of the cane on the ass then  urlLink beg for more on the tits as a reward  would safeword with a relatively mild paddling.  I don't know why pain is so subjective.  (Believe me, if I could figure out how to get masochistic pleasure out of the tension headache I have right now, I'd be blissed out...)  What I do know, is that the varnished oak paddle needs a name.  Master agreed.  I suggested we name it "Safeword".  Master expressed his disapproval of that name with several nipple tweaks.  So I suggested that we ask our readers for suggestions.  Master agreed, but I'm not allowed to tell you to vote for "Safeword".  As this is not a democracy, any votes for "Safeword" will be invalidated.  Besides, this is a suggestion box, not a ballot box.  Master, will there be a prize if someone's suggestion is chosen?

      katy failed to stress one thing in her report on the Laundry and Dominance incident.  I usually only suffer from jetlag when traveling from West to East -- presumably because of the 'lost' time.  This trip, I have suffered badly from it, despite travelling from East to West.  The day in question, I actually had a two-hour sleep around lunchtime.  Sleeping during the day is practically unheard of for me.  I probably shoudn't even have tackled the laundry that day, but I was running short of shirts.  Anyway, I am usually  much  better at the hanging of things, as katy also failed to mention.  As to her question at the end of her post, the answer is "Neither."  Logically, katy understands that I don't "twitch" at the concept of handing over control to someone with better skills than I have.  Emotionally, she might not quite believe it yet.  The alternative, of course, is that she was bloody annoyed, forgot I was feeling unwell, and used the formal approach to hide her annoyance.

      Until the immigration paperwork is final, Master is not able to legally work.  Since he's not even a little bit lazy, he takes care of our home while I'm at work.  Every time I enter the apartment, it's cleaner than what I left behind.  I still have a few household chores.  I don't mind doing ironing and mending, and Master despises both.  I am certainly expected to clean up behind myself (something Master is gently teaching me to do--at some point, there will be swats administered for items left out of place, but we are still in the training stage), and of course, some chores, like making the bed, are easier for two.  So I came home from work the other day and Master announced that we had no laundry detergent left, but that there was also not a stitch of dirty laundry anywhere in the house.  Like me, Master folds or hangs up the clothing when it's finished drying.  Unlike me, he goes on to the next step of actually putting it away.  Except for my clothes, because he hadn't figured out where I keep my own clothes.  He wasn't feeling well that day, so he didn't think to tell me I needed to put my clothes away, and I went several days without noticing.  A couple of days later, he said "I'm not very good at hanging up clothes, so I'll need you to take care of these."  He gestured to the clothes hanging in the laundry closet.  "Not very good" at hanging up clothes was a bit of an understatement.  He had two blouses hung with their collars mangled and folded half inside the neckline.  One tank top was actually draped onto a skirt hanger.  Several things I wouldn't ordinarily need to iron had to go into the ironing basket directly.  If I had been dealing with any man other than Master, I'd have suspected the male trick of feigning incompetence to get out of chores, but that would be impossible for Master.  He's far too honest for one thing, but he's also too Dominant to use passive-aggressive methods.  Now I was faced with a slave's dilemma.  Of course the correct thing for a slavegirl to do in a dilemma is to ask her Master for advice.  Which I did.  "Master, which would be more likely to make your Dom energy twitch:  If I give you lessons on how to hang clothes, or if I request that you leave my laundry alone and let me do it?"    As it's bedtime, I'll leave the story for Master to finish. He really isn't half bad at laundry, though.

      Emma asked where I've been since Master arrived.  You see, I've been chained to the wall in the closet this whole time.  He only led me by the leash to the bathroom when needed, and gave me dinner in a bowl on the floor.....   KIDDING!  Okay, we're hardwired, full-time kinky people, but I think more than an hour or two of being chained somewhere would be too extreme for us.  The less interesting truth is that I have a full-time job and you can imagine how our time at home is being used.  You know, like unpacking Master's bags and finding room for all our books and rearranging the furniture.  What, that isn't quite what you imagined?  ;-)

      As the web master slave for captive heart, I just set the nameservers for our newly acquired domain.  When the DNS  copulation  propogation takes place, http://www.captiveheart.us will point to a (sigh!) warning page.  Yes, I know.  What's the point?  But we want to be safe.  There's nothing to stop anyone from bypassing the warning page and bookmarking the blog itself (which will eventually live at captiveheart.us/blog) but MASTER IS DRIVING ME CRAZY TALKING ABOUT ENGLIGH ENGLISH PUNCTUATION!  (As you can imagine, I am not getting my nipples pinched)  OW!  What was I saying?  Um.... yeah, stay tuned.

      As katy mentioned, we will be moving to a new host and new software between now and Monday.  We may disappear altogether for a day or two, while the DNS propogation happens.  Don't worry, we'll be back.  (with new piccies, I promise)  And no, this isn't about to become a pay site.

      I'm so glad that Blogger has finally allowed comments, but it does have a flaw.  As the site administrator, I have the option to either require registration or allow anonymous comments.  I really really don't want to turn on registration, but I hate not knowing who is talking to us!  So the compromise is to ask you nicely to please sign your comments.  It doesn't have to be your real name, and I promise not to tell your mom you were here.  ;)

      We had misplaced the condoms, and I was really really needy.  (Well, I AM a slut!)  So I begged Master to use my ass.  I think this is the fourth or fifth time we've been successful at anal, and I'm really coming to love it.  This time, I had a hand mirror, and I watched his cock stretching my anus.  Later, when he'd pulled out, I watched, fascinated, as my relaxed anus slowly closed.  By the time I thought of asking Master to take a picture, it had nearly returned to it's normal state.

      On having one's cock damaged .....  My slavegirl, although a US citizen, has been practising the British art of understatement.  There was some blood at the time, and considerable pain.  The discomfort, and some light bleeding continued for almost a week.  Our first few play sessions involving penetrative sex where gentle, to say the least.  [understatement alert]  She couldn't even 'kiss it better'.

      I love doggy style.  It's wild and savage and sexy and I love it both psychologically and physically.  But it can get a little... uncontrolled.  I'm bucking back and forth.  His cock is sliding in and out of me, almost full length.  And then full length.  And then he slid out and I didn't realize it and I bucked back.    We missed, and I bent his cock.  And not realizing it right away, I did it again.  Ouch!  Those were the first two times I broke his cock.  The third time, it was an anatomy issue--the kind of injury that doesn't happen to circumcised cocks.  It was just a little tear where the foreskin attaches to the cock.  There was a little bit of blood and too much discomfort for sex.  Luckily, we can have fun doing things other than sex.  The bullet and the paddle got workouts.  And Master and I both would rather risk the occasional minor injury than do without a foreskin completely.  I love Master's foreskin.  :)  What was I talking about?

      As far as I can tell, I'm not switchable.  I'm a hard wired sub, and I love it that way.  Master makes the rules and I obey them.  But there are a few limits that I have, and we ran into one of them a few minutes ago.  We haven't had much internet access, so when we got some today, Master asked me if I would post.  I said I would.  Then I started catching up on my kinky blog reading.  A few minutes later, he noticed that I hadn't started writing yet.  I told him I needed to do a little reading in order to get in the right mindset.  A few minutes later, he prodded me again.  This is when I realized that I was getting annoyed.  A moment's reflection, and I realized why.  Early in our relationship, a similar situation had arisen.  I'd discovered that no matter how submissive I am, I can't write on command.    I reminded him of this, and it took him by surprised.  "But surely that has to be flexible in situations like this when we have a time limit."  I wish.  Ah well.  We talked about it, I finished reading, and now I'm writing.  Just another minor hiccup in happily ever after.

      Doms do not make good patients.  They try to order the universe to cooperate in making them feel better.  The universe remains unimpressed.  But even if Doms were perfect patients, subs make terrible nurses.  I suppose if there was something obvious to do, like placing cold compresses on the forehead, or preparing a certain type of food, or bringing the pills in every 4 hours on the dot, we could manage okay.  What we really really suck at is when there isn't anything in particular to do that would be helpful.  My submissive desire made me want to make Master better, more than anything, but the only useful thing I could do was stay out of the way.  Fortunately, it was mostly out of his system the next day.  Just in time for me to start my period.  Can we say "grumpy little bitch"?  I knew we could.

I have mentioned katy's stretches, as the more astute among our three or four loyal readers will have noticed.  Here's this morning's effort.     I was going to comment that it's a wonder we get anything done in the morning, but I get to 'do' katy.  I am a lucky chap.

						   3:30 pm... migraine coming on. Aching in neck and shoulders. Stretching relieves pain only during stretch. Nausea that feels like a lump in the stomach.  ate for lunch:  salad with lettuce, tomatoes, and italian dressing pasta alfredo same as yesterday  4:15 left work early, drank coke 4:45 took 2 magnesium pills with a hershey bar with almonds 5:20 home, going to bed on sofa with blinds closed and earplugs in to block the sound of children at the pool. Nausea worse. pain a little less, esp in shoulders 5:30 put TENS unit on golf balls on shoulders. Normally I use these at a 6-8 mA setting. More than that, and it causes muscle contractions which the manual says isn't supposed to happen on the 'pain relief' cycle. I got it up to 13mA before discomfort caused me to stop. The muscle contractions never happens.  After about 15 minutes, I decided to move the electrodes further up the neck. I placed them on either side of the spine just below the hairline. I got it up to 9 or 10 before the muscle contractions started. Then the weirdest thing. Every few minutes, I had to lower the setting because the TENS sensation became more pronounced and the muscles started contracting. Each time i lowered it, I could barely feel it at first, and then the area became more sensitive until the muscles started contracting. I got it as low as four by the end of the cycle (another 15 minutes) and I've never felt anything on 4 before. It was taking the pain with it.  After the TENS cycle ended, a few minutes passed, and I felt the sick pain of the migraine again. I started another cycle. I had to go back up to 6 at the start, but lowered it down to 4 after a few minutes, and fell asleep with it running.   The muscles obviously started out less sensitive to the TENS. Was this because of the migraine? Then they became more sensitive. Was this because the TENS was killing the migraine? Or was the magnesium killing the migraine? Or was the magnesium making the muscles more sensitive? Too early to say.  10pm: woke up, groggy and a little sensation fog. (Colors dull, thoughts slow, sense of touch dull.) Can't say it's very unwelcome. Drinking a glass of water now.  12am:  used TENS again.  pain getting worse.  took two more mgnesium pills.  Took bedtime pills.  middle of the night:  night sweats  8:30 am:  wake up call.  Seem to be okay, but not great.  Took a salt bath  9:30am:  sitting at computer and drinking a glass of water  10:30am:  no active pain, but definitely not normal.  ate 2 slices of toast with margarine and apple butter.  Went to bed with TENS unit on.  Slept until after 3.  3:15pm:  woke feeling very foggy and thirsty.  No active pain.  4ish:  took two more magnesium.  Ate rice with sugar and milk.  sometime i ate tomato soup, but the computer crashed and ate the post then i got mad at the computer and took half a xanax  at 7 pm.  then i ate ice cream.  then i fell alseep with out taking my evening pills or brushing my teeth or anything.  woke up with call at 8. took a bath. was okay until i couldn't find the pattern, and then i freaked out and now i feel like killing everything.

						   Went to the p-doc today.  Dr. Giorgi Guarnieri is no longer there.  Dr. Cline wanted to lower my dosage of Lexapro, which I resisted because of the current stress and because I'm still trying to manage my migraines and don't want to change dosage and muddy the issue.  I got a script for Xanax (15 pills... enough to last the rest of the year) and Lexapro (3 months worth).    I will call Southern Health soon in order to get a new doctor that is covered.
