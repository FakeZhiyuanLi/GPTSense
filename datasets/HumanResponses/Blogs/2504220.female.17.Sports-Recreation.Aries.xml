      hi im back. i was jus making a list of all the stuff i need to pack. i havent started yet =/ but its ok cuz i still have over two hours to pack. we are leaving around 1. so i figured i would come back and write nothingness in here cuz i have nothing else better to go yet and no one is online really, every1 is away. ben called me last nite at 12:15 a.m. Now u see i dont mind if ppl call me cuz its an emergancy, thats why my cell is always on, but im not even talking to ben and he is still calling me. and calling in the middle of the nite. if that had waken me up i woulda been soooo mad. every nite something keeps happening that i always wake up...like mrs. berrios calling cuz she thought adam was here at 12:30 the other nite but he wasnt. ben needs to get a grip. im sure u will be reading this ben cuz ur a stalker so im sorry ben but oh well. LEAVE ME ALONE BEN!  ughhhhhh. thats the first time i ever skipped a space in the blog haha. a year ago today i had stayed awake the whole nite at jesi's house for her pre-new years party, getting to know joel. now joel barely talks to me. i hope jesi has another party but i dont think she can this year so me and her are supposed to hang out towards the end of vacation. i still have to read this stupid of mice and men book for english bahhhh. my hair takes a long time to dry. its wet. it better be dry by 1. i think im supposed to clean up a lil b4 i go upstate and i also have to pack so i need to leave soon. ahh im procrastinating (idk if i spelt that rite). ::burps:: excuse me! achooo ::sneezes:: God bless me! wow my body is weird. i kno im goin to forget something when im packing so i hope i have everything on the list i made. kate really needs to change the title of this blog. i wonder why they call it a blog. i wonder if a nail clipper would cut hair...wow it did ... haha u wouldnt notice though cuz my hair is long. wow im bored. my mom jus called and her and my dad are still guna be at the hospital for a while. im watchin the wayne brady show but its almost over. the new hoobastank cd is really good. i can relate to a lot of the songs...

      Happy Christmas from jingo. I gave my mom 8 polish carols on a cd and she was very happy. thanks to kate yo for contributing one. tomora is christmas and im semi in the mood and semi not. i went to church and we did the traditional sing hymns and light candles and all. it was nice. i got my present from kate but i didnt open it. i put it under the tree for me to open tomora cuz i want a suprise cuz i kno everything else that my parents got me :-( when i felt kates present it felt kinda soft like a lil soft covered baby book or a lil pillow or wallet or something. oh well ill see. i hope she likes her presents-i love lucy calendar, finding nemo poster, candy cane, card, and mix cd. i gave larissa her present also but she forgot mine at home, but its alrite. nehow ben got in a car accident today :-( atleast hes ok. he needs to be extremely careful when he drives. jeanelle called me from cali again today. if she moved there, which she will eventually, im guna die. i love her so much. we have so many memories-hairspray especially. my dad is working rite now and tomora. oh well. im goin to my gmas tomora afternoon. i wonder wat my uncle got me. he always gets me interesting things. rite now im watchin bewitched. i listened to the polish cd wit my mom near the tree b4. i hope my mom really does like them and is not jus saying she does, i really think she does though. thats good cuz i spent a lot of time on it cuz my comp is slow and i needed to find names of good ones and so on. and each one took hours to download. and i only got 7 but 7 is better than none. + 1 from kateeeee. i hope everyone has a happy holiday and remembers u cant have CHRISTmas without christ. and u kno wat i find funny? some of my atheist friends gave me gifts and wat not but they dont believe in God so what are they celebrating? i guess ill have to ask them that. lalalalala. wow this bewitched episode resembles the one like in i love lucy where lucy has to hide all the chocolate and eat them cuz the belt is putting them out too fast. but in betwitched its bananas and they have to dip them in chocolate. i wonder which episode came out first....

      Christmas is supposed to be about God and celebrating his birth, rite? then why can't everyone jus get along and be happy? i dont kno...shouldnt everyone be happy? why is everyone overly obssessed about gifts? i have been upset most of the day and i have been spending hours on my computer trying to get these songs for my mom and she comes home and calls me a retard for trying to fix an ornament for the tree. ughhhh. tomora is christmas eve and both my parents have to work. when i have kids and am married im guna always give my kids the best christmas and everything jus cuz i kno how hard it is not to have good holidays. if ne one actually reads this blog and u celebrate xmas with ur family and u think its annoying, well get over it and be thankful....

      Hey its Jen. Kate made this. Good work kate. Im bored and jus figured out how to do this when meanwhile kate has had this set up for a while. Im eating pizza and im bored and im decorating my tree in a lil. Jeanelle is in cali. I miss u jeanelle. Rite now at 5:45 p.m. our time she is sitting out on the beautiful beach as most of us our at home doing nothing. Im jealous. Im watchin ice skating and wish i was ice skating. I only went once in my whole life last winter wit joel n adam. Yesterday I hung out at the mall wit ryan lori n ben. I saw marcie for a few minutes too. Im currently trying to cheer up. I have been sad ever since I got home from baton practice at like 11:45. Thanks goes to tori for the ride home. I havent showered yet-ew. oh well im not goin newhere ill shower after i decorate. Usually our tree is decorated already but each year christmas gets worse n worse and i miss old times more and more. Congrats to Kate on her acheivements in her meet today in da "sit-ay". nehow i missed alexs band preforming yesterday cuz i thought it was tonite and its not :( Sorry Alex! i promise ill come next time! Im so glad we dont have school for the next 2 weeks. Thats a nice break from school stresses. I usually have all these projects but i only have to read a book and answer questions. I dont kno why Kate named this 'I feel your fire', I'll have to ask her that later. I got new uniforms for baton today and they look funny-haha tori. I think if i loose a few pounds and shrink an inch cuz from my waist to shoulder it mite fit better. Baton has been slowly falling apart and it makes me sad. We have a competiton on Jan. 11 for NJBTA. We arent ready so we can go as soloists but the entry dues are due wed. and i have no info about it and i need to talk to my mom. I need to go to this competitions cuz the more i go to the more of a chance ill have to be in championships which i havent been in for years cuz my team is getting lazy. I need to buy gifts and wrap them. I havent been to church or yg in 3 weeks and that upsets me so much. and im not goin to church tomora but atleast i have the yg white elephant xmas party, its guna rock...if u wana come tell me. I need to get into the christmas spirit. I hope that party helps. I was supposed to decorate my tree wit marcie today but that didnt work out and she is goin to FL in a few days and she gets to see sonny and fil...no fair :( I hope me n her hang out b4 then. But i guess i should go, i dont kno how often im guna post in here cuz my comp is gay and i was supposed to get one a year ago but i didnt so hopefully i will soon. HAPPY HOLIDAYS and goodbye.

      i had a good time in MD that should really be ML cause that would make more sense like MD should be michigan or something idk that doesnt make sense either...got to theorize it a bit...well it was really sad mark touched a lot of peoples lives and im sad that i didnt know him very well. He obviously meant a lot to a lot of people: he sponsored children in latin america, he was a wonderful uncle,son, brother, and he seemed to be a great friend who loved to talk about quantum physics, music, and life.He loved to cook also. I am very sad at 49 hes gone. The worst part about it is that he loved my aunt and my aunt loved him when she went to give a speech she was hysterically crying and said :this was the best 1.5 years of my life( she only knew him for that long) and how he taught her to love her family, life and other stuff. On a lighter note: i met my two "cousins" i guess you can call them that and one mattie was my age 16 and the other annie was 14 my sisters age they are from chicago pretty cool     s we talked for aloooooong time had fun with the baby. there school hsa like 4000 ppl in it and they have like 6 gyms and a field house. and a lot of other cool stuff and they think i have an accent I GOT A ROCKLAND ACCENT LMAO haha who woulda thunk it not me...oh and the waiter at denny's had a southern accent i was in love   kate found something out about  cr ode and it shocked  kr ate

      we had a 2 hr delay today and thats really good bc i went to bed at 10:30 but really didnt go to bed til midnite:30. ppl like to call me late. ill leave it at that. i dont really mind though. but someone else called me at like 6:50 cough larissa cough and she was like do we have a delat and i didnt kno wat was goin on and thought it was like 5 in the morning and ended up callin her back in like 2 minutes when i realized wat time it was and then asked my mom... but nehow today went by quick wit short periods but then i stayed after til 4:15 for this thing called math league... woopie... i got 2 rite outta 8 but they are really hard and some ppl got none or 1 so i feel smart! yay. i also figured out how to put links on our site like kate did but i couldnt b4 cuz kate accidentally changed the settings. so ill be added links woot woot. the blog is improving.   today at school there was a fite and it was quite amusing. no offense to the ppl that were in it... well here's the story.. me and kate and jeanelle were walked from french to our 3 rd period class. and we turn a corner and everyone is at a complete standstill. which is usually normal at our school due to over population. but then i realized there was a fite and a huge circle around these two girls, (nicole and maritza) and they were like at each other like wild animals... nicole's face was all scratched up and nicole gave maritza a bloody nose.. then my guidance counsler broke it up and i had one boot on, dont ask.   i taught french wit no boots on today. haha i was waiting for larissa to call me back and she jus did so now i have to call her back when i get offline. in britney spears' new video she like kisses a lot of guys... wow thats interesting...   tonite there is a life meeting for ppl who didnt go to the other one {arizona} so i hope my mom lets me go. larissa wants to come... and i hope kate can take me if my mom doesnt let me. blahhhh ill tell u more later i gotta make calls n wat not hahaa.

      thinking about the warped tour and how much fun that was and how hillarious things are ...i  hope this yr is just as fun...and i was thinking about taking a road trip to sunny CA cause its freezing here. and i was thinking about my weird dream lastnight and the pope. and i dont want jen to be stressed or depressed...i feel like everyone is depressed which is really depressing except for the fact that im not depressed and i feel bad i was suposed to see denise at the ambulance building but my parents are busy. and my mom got her will in the mail :( and i was wondering what my life would be like w/o my mom and my dad and i started crying i love soooo much even if they piss me off a lot i like to think while listening to the dropkick murphys the band where i thought i was giong to die or pass out: it was the first out side concert i had ever seen and the ataris had just finished playing boys if the summer where they smashed their guitar it was AWESOME so my sis and christina decide they wanna stay in the back for the Dropkick Murphys and jen.marcie.laura were stuck in a lot of traffic. so me adam decide we are going to be front row...well we were literally the 2nd row of ppl...so we listened to me first and the gimme gimmes [on the stage next to ours] then the bagpipe dudes come onto the stage and at that moment the entire crowd behing me pushes up against me so these hot sweaty guys in like college surrounding me and for awhile i thought it was really cool until i realised i was literally the only girl in the front, adam and me had gotten seperated and these people kept landing on my head. and i was in the mid. of a mosh pit so finally like at the last song i got pulled out but that meant i got even closer top the band but it was really really cool and we got sprayed with water and yeah  im going to stop thinking

      i got this shirt from larissa for christmas that says the sugar shack. thank you larissa. part of being in a sport is realizing that some days u will have bad days and some days u will have good days. jus thought i would put that out there for a variety of reasons. if everyone was always # 1 then no one else would get the chance to experience it. 4 girls from my baton team went to a competition today. i wanted to go but yea its complicated. baton is starting to like fall apart but w/e im goin to the rest of nj's competitions cuz i wana go to the championships but who knos nemore. our coaches really seem to care less each year and they didnt even come to the competition that some girls went to today. all the effort is put into making the little ppl better and me and tori and liz and denae and all the older ppl wana improve and do things and we cant. its so gay. ugh well i wont dwell on that. im happy there is yg today, hopefully it wont snow b4 its time for yg otherwise my mom will be like "u cant go". hopefully it will snow tonite and we have a delay tomora... kate or someone im me if we have a delay or closing bc WHUD isnt rite nemore. i think im goin to go be depressed now... goodbye

      i jus spent 4 hours  straight  in a closet...dont ask...and for all u perverts i wasnt wit a guy...i was at a restuarant...nvm...but today was my first day of work and it was interesting...ha i get 10 dollars an hour for my first day and u prob. dont! and next week im gettin more :-) and im not a waitress... but lots of ppl thought i was like in 8th grade :-( and the lady who got me the job, lesli, jus randomly called me up today and asked me if i wanted it. i was really excited cuz it wont take up too much time cuz its only once a week and i get paid a lot. and i have been seriously wanting a job and praying about it and then all of a sudden it happens :-) its kinda boring but ill get ova it. and lesli's daughter used to have my job but got sick of it so now i have it and all the waiters and waitresses thought i was another one of her daughters and were like "tell ur mom i say hi" and im like "sure"...at first i was there and this manager jimmy and he really didnt talk to me but then the other hostess came and she was nice and got me free food and drinks but she doesnt work on saturdays usually so i hope next week the other lady will be jus as nice...rite now im talkin to jeanelle kate laura and someone else not really and i hope my comp doesnt freeze. today also larissa came over at like 12:30 and left at like 3 and i helped her wit math and i had the same review sheet so it all worked out. then i went to marcies at like 3:45 and i havent hung out wit her in forever and i was only there for like a little more than an hour. it sucks that she is always wit other ppl... then i was off to work... haha thats so funny to say... and so now i do that once a week and tutoring so hopefully that will bring in more money to put towards arizona. i wish certain ppl would leave me alone. my ankles are cold. tomora is church, taking down tree, the youth group!! woot woot holla back...  this lady told me to never have ne "F*ckin" kids cuz she hates hers..wat do u say to that?

      baton practice was pretty good besides the fact that we have a baton competition and kids dont understand how not to drop the baton and dont ask. then i volunteered for 3 hours at school for science honor society and then i went to work. i really feel like saying 5 words rite now but i wont and i really feel like sooo mad and u have no idea unless u lived like in the 1900s but ill jus leave it at that cuz im guna try to cheer up by eating ice cream, and i shoulda so went snow tubing today...this is the first and last time i ever give up a youth group event...i have a baton competition tomora...wish me luck...its my first one in months..

      today was pretty good, me and larissa made up after fighting for like 3 weeks for no reason. and we got to listen to music in french. and todays ash wednesday. and i guess im not giving up ice cream for lent cuz i ate it in chem...we made ice cream in chem and it didnt taste that bad...props to my lab partner-eric. it was kinda salty though and we had to eat it with a fork. haha. some guy asked kate for her phone number and he was pretty hott and she didnt give it to him. tomora i have a science honor society meeting...lovely...and then i have to come home and then tutor from 5:30-6:30. i guess im not goin tubin but its all good...im goin to work crew most likely and im definately goin to regular lc and LIFE!! im soooo excited, u have no clue unless ur one of IMAGE. shout out to nick-best youth pastor ever... i hope he's not mad at me and kate for skippin small groups. but sometimes we really accomplish nothin and ppl laugh the whole time and its really dumb. the leaders are nice and all but they seriously need more control over the girls. i really miss holly and katie o'connor and i like it when katie simpson comes but she hasnt been a small group leader in a while. props to kristin and vanessa but the guys have awesome leaders too...robx steve and john even though john is mean to me..... i'm currently listening to the third day cd (props to jesi) cuz i have their songs stuck in my head again...this mite be telling me something...hmm. i think tonite im goin to garnerville methodist church cuz my church and theirs and stony point's all combine for ash wednesday service. i dont remember the last time i went to an ash wednesday service. i used to be catholic up to 5th grade.  i really need to finish this convo that i was having with marcie but she stayed after school.       nothing compares*

      today started off good...i went to baton and since i wasnt there last week i actually had something to learn and catch up on. it was pretty good. then i came home talked to kate on the telly and watched the movie "Underworld" and it was pretty good. and then i took a nap and worried about goin to work and getting fired but i went to work and didnt get fired but made much less money then i normally do and really wana quit. i try to think rationally and say that i only have a few more weeks left and that i get to read and be away from my house but i think i would rather be home than there like in my room with the door closed or something. i cant stand working there bc it makes me more depressed and i cant help it. i need a job where im actually doin something cuz i have a short attention span most of the time and get bored and there is no where for me to go in that really small closet. but neway im sooo hungry but when i came home and looked at my food i wanted to throw up so i ate some tomatoes cuz thats all that looked appatizing or however u spell it. hopefully church and/or yg will cheer me up tomora and in the afternoon my mom is supposedly letting me drive on the parkway for the first time so all ::b e w a r e::...that should be interesting and im sure it will end up wit me and my mom fighting. it really feels like valentines day was yesterday but it wasnt, not that that has nething to do wit nethin. i really cant wait until marcie gets home tomora and i hope she calls me when she lands cuz by the time she gets home her parents probably wont let her make phone calls and she will call joe when they sleep but hopefully she'll call me...that reminds me i get to open another letter. she wrote me letters for everyday she was away cuz she did it for joe so i made her do it for me and even though they are so silly, im glad she did them. let's see ill open it now...aww it cheered me up a bit cuz she put a band-aid on it, dont ask. thanks mars! wat also depresses me about my job is that the hangers turn my hands black and it like doesnt come off and its so annoying. time to go wash my hands again...   i really hope nick's sermon is good tomorrow.

Leagues HJ 4'            600m 1:55 so i guess just like random times he felt like writing down its pretty cool tho then on the back had the 400 he wanted to see us run and the 200 split we needed to hit so i had 65 and 31-- then he was making fun of me but i couldnt hear what he was saying, and then we got there>> we walk in and all the g i r l s are lined up for the 4x400 {our race} so we run downstairs do 2 laps by the time we get up there they are all lined up so we strip down and w/e and the first heat was on the track but it didnt matter cause since we were late were in the  6th heat.  both 4x400 teams. so do do do i had forgotten to take my watch off so i had to hide it, amanda 65. 7 ran then i ran then siberia 63.7  ran then zaire ran. pretty good team. i ran good i was happy 65.2 which was good but i had funny splits 30/35   .. oh well i'll get her in spring :-P.. [they should have smiley faces in herre]  cooled down for like 5 min. waited for the bus got on the bus talked to pash and he said i ran good seeing that i didnt have much of a season.. cause of my knee bOO!! and that in spring im going to run lots of 400's, 800's, 400 hurdles??, steeplechase?? [that should be funny 2000m ha] TJ, HJ. and we'll be doing that two coach thing we started in the beginning of winter-- me, steph,  both amandas, maybe islaur, and spacey. except that was like workout after workout and not good.  so we'll see how that turns out. i guess im running at state quals pash didnt say anything to me so idk..  oh and then he ordered pizza   wooooooooooooooooooo  but it was late so we waited for awhile and my mom came before 5:05 haha, and then the pizza came and it was stephs brother and i took some and left *thanks* it was good. came home did nothing brother and cousins came home,  had a good irish dinner :) corn beef and cabbage!! then i realised i had to do this SAT crap and then cj called and said ppl were over his house but i couldnt go sorry* cause i had to finish this my moms like im paying 60 dollars you hafta or you'll be grounded blahh . so im supposed to be working on the SAT its a whole SAT ahh im almost half way finished so i figured id take a break.  a month and 3 days till my birthday--  oh yeah we need some more ideas on how to get to the blink-182 concert soon cause the tixs might sell out soon and thatd  be baaad.. im tired.. sat class is at 11- 1 and im probably not going to rkac {ism} so thats about it im outtie * haha yeah im gonna straighten my hair even tho my sis claims its "already straight".   i have no random memory today.

      yeah.. i went to the mall with cj and jeff, lets see i think we are the most indecisive people you will ever meet,  so we all after a lot of how are we gonna get there and how are we gonna get home sorta deal decided to go to the movies. so my dad drops cj and me off at target. and he told jeff to meet us a Dunkin Dounuts and then jeff calls and cj says we'll meet him there then we walk like to the escalator and then back to imax cause he said jeff was gonna be there  and then jeff calls and so then we walk to D&D it was funny supposedly it was "planned". ok so then we spent like 20 minutes picking out a movie it was really funny we called people, and then finally through process of elimination each chose 1 movie and did rock paper sicsor shoots and miracle won.. interesting movie.. i was very very uncomfortable cause my legs are so freaking long and this guy had the seat aaaaalllll the way back, yeah so i kinda had my feet like over the next seat, haha yeah then we walked outta the movie theatre and who is there but  pash  I KNOW WHAT YOU WERE DOING AT 10 ish friday!! i didnt actually see him till he passed but jeffand cj said he pointed at us.. cant wait to hear what he hasta say about that tommorow. then we wandered around the mallie it was funny and i was tired so i couldnt stop laughing, and then we went to barnes and nobles-- i have never laughed so much at books in my life-- jeffs car was really cool the names of the song were flashing on the screen and i was having fun reading them. then this 22 minute long song came on "thick as a brick" hahaand  cj was like playing the drums/ piano to this song and it was hillarious i was dying which was partially cause i was overtired.  then we got to cjs house and my sister gave me like the wrong # and i got some weird voice-mail then she gave me the right one and i called my mom.. yeah   so all in all i feel less like mud then i did before

      jeepers creepers 2 wasnt that good. i saw it wit lori today on my new dvd player. hooler. now im sitting home and i feel weird cuz im never home on friday nites. but its ok. my plan was to somehow cause  to hang out and it worked. i dont kno if i have baton tomora morning but either way ill have nothing to do all afternoon and then i have work at nite and i hope they dont fire me cuz its the only way to get money for AR and SAT course and driving lessons. i want ice cream but we have none. my tv is too loud but the remote doesnt work so i cant make it lower w/o getting up. i am drinking coke and eating chocolate but i need to stop cuz its making me sick. i can't wait til tomora at 10:30 p.m. when most likely ill be home from work and kno whether or not they      me and whether or not i still have my job. now im watching grounded for life, the tv show and its funny. and im talking to jesi. and i found this picture of the eiffel tower from my uncle and i wish i was in france or europe or somewhere, not here. teenagers these days grow up with the lack of responsibilities and sit at there computer all day or watch tv and sleep and eat. i try not to fall into this catagory but there is nothing else to do so now i understand why ppl work all day when there isnt school. well i guess ill call sometime next week and schedule my driving lessons and road test, atleast that way i can drive around and stuff. i wana paint my moms car pink and im rambling on about nothing cuz im bored... i swallowed the first tooth i lost like when i was 7. it was right after my grandpa died and i was at the florist ordering flowers for his funeral and then the lady gave me a pear to make me stop crying and then i lost my tooth and couldnt find it and then realized i swallowed it. that was interesting. in elm. school i was best friends with this      molica tang for like 4 years and then she moved and i lost contact with her :-/ cj liked me in 4th grade and sent nico to talk to me haha ok ill stop talkin now

      this county offers little entertainment to teenagers. i think something should open where u could like rent rooms in it or something...kinda like hotel but cheaper but nicer than a motel...idk...  today i got woken up by my mom asking me my PSAT scores cuz she is signing me up for a class. then somehow i managed to go back to sleep until 12 when ryan called and woke me up and wanted to come over but i didnt let him cuz i looked like blah and really needed a shower and to eat breakfast...oh well..and now im bored and mite hang out wit kate tonite but we have nothing to do and i wish i could drive and that it was summer. im getting driving lessons soon and then scheduling my road test...very exciting... :-) but then comes me convincing my mom to get another car and letting me have her old one.   since kate had a random memory of pre-k i want one too but i didnt go to pre-k...  i remember in elm. school i took liz reynolds pencils and pencil case and she told the principal.  i really need to put things in perspective and idk.....  steve wants me and kate to have a live journal instead of a blog..

      *and all that jazz  well today was a day that wasnt very eventful: got up at 7 fell back asleep, went to practice, an hour early, realized i forgot my flats when carolyn came in, jenna and cj tried to help me with my SAT analogies. then practice wasnt fun we did 2 laps warmup drills and then 4 x100 or so meter strides, 150 pick ups that he stole from baloga, timed 500m weirdly [0-100m sprint, 100-300 as if you were only running a 200 so really really fast, 300-500 fast] mine ended up being 300-500 jog.. but i still ran the same as stick so its all good and i mightve beaten m.s] hehehe then mrs.trentacosti got me out of a cooldown WOO and dfrove me home but i went outside and cooled down for 20min and the short dog stared barking at me,  I      SMALL DOGS   i dont care how much bigger i am then them the scare the poo out of me.. then i came hdome and showered fixed me a huge lunch cause i was starving, then fell asleep woke up at 4 to my mom yelling at me to get up for my SAT class but it was postponed till sun.. wooo no church.. idk if thats good or bad tho, then i watched part of the mummy 2 , and then i ate a dinner at home for the first time since sunday. that was nice my mom cooks really good veg. food. then i watched planet of the apes, and some of the donald trump show; yep and thats about allk  THIS HOSTILITY IS UNACCEPTABLE-  randomness: when i was in pre-k we made green eggs and ham thats the only thing i remember about it and that me and elizabeth blank stomped on some     s castle of foam blocks and then i got a time out in a corner.. and i cried haha

      my throat hurts. it hurts when i cough and sneeze and swallow and talk. and now i can barely talk. and i had to call these ppl that called me looking for a math tutor for their son but i couldnt talk so luckily they didnt pick up and it jus kept ringing.  my eyes also hurt and since they always normally hurt it hurts a lot.  i dont wana stay home today but if i go out ill like die and infect everyone else.  i think its bad to repeatedily have cough drops. if i go to the doctor they will make me take a strept test or however u spell it and i  hate those so idk wat to do. my nose is runny. i keep getting like flem caught in my throat. ugh.

Sometimes she said "um um." sometimes it was even every other word... the college nite made me realize that im poor and not goin to college. then i came home and watched smallville, or atleast the last half of it and talked to marcie during the o.c. until she went to go call joe.   today i was supposed to lift after school but i didnt have a ride home and there were no buses. so i came home and had a headache and almost feel asleep until my mom woke me up by calling me and then i went back to bed and now i have to do lots of chem. extra credit. and im hugry.  i wana go snow tooooobing but i cant :'( i need to go to baton practice that morning at 9 and i have work at 5:30. i need money for life 2004 which is much better than snow toooobing... and i have my first baton competition of the year that im goin to on the 29th so i need to really practice especially the day b4. and im missing baton on sat. to take my 5hrs course.

      school was w/e -- then  i ran-- then i went to an xc party which was alright.. seemed a little weird digs called us up and but his arm on our shoulders [that was harder for me seeing that i am finally taller then him :p ] umm for me he said how even tho mentally, and my spirir, and w/e else i was training hard but cause of me being freaking anemic i didnt have a good season.. which was true it wasnt a very good season at all lets say ive gotten at least 3 minutes worse over the span of 3 years.. but im not as anemic anymore so hopefully he said id be a key to the success to the team... this i really hope is true because if i dont break 21 aka beat myself as a freshman i will go die in a corner with a garbage pale on my head haha.. oh and the sad thing was when the seniors got theres expecially amanda mc. and jen yudman cause i love those     s they are they best.. the other sad thing that happened was he announced the captains for next year and i didnt really expect to be one but i sorta did in a way cause idk ive been running since i was in 7th grade and i really love it.. and next year me and lauren will be the only ones who ran as freshman that are seniors  so idk i thought i might have a chance but colette deserved it too and so did ash and jenna so im happy for them ..sorta.. haha.. so i think im running over break but idk it depends on how i run friday.. i hope i run fassssst even tho i dont think my relay teams gonna be awesome but still good.. cause jenna and stick and amanda c. are running a 4x800.. o well i just wanna run good   --impossible is nothing--

      well lets see i think i should proabably edit my other blog down there so maybe i will later casue i didnt add a lot of things. anyways lets im gonna give you my recollection of last nights events: so jeanelle picked me up a little after 3 and lori,ange,and joel were w/her. so then we helped her unpack all the groceries, and set up for her party. for example jeanelle lori and angela made these like sandwitch things and joel made like a veggie platter and i sat there and collected all the garbage.. best job.. made myself a cheese sandwhich but it wasnt that good cause i dont like wheat bread. yup. then it was weird cause i havent really talked to joel for like a year and the last time i thought he was like a total jerk, well i think hes changed alot hes cool and he cracked my back and that felt really good cause i dont go to my chiro anymore :( . anyways im not sure what else i did btwn then and 7 but i think that sums it up...basically... then @ 7 people started coming over and then jen and marcie and laura were there and then i ate and i didnt stop eating i sat by the food and ate. im so going to get fat. anyways then jeff.phil. and cj came to jeanelles they make me laugh they're really funny.   then a bunch more people came and i ate more. called my house on 4 phones and jeffs won. then jeff and phil left and so did a few other ppl. then more ppl came and the party got weird cause idk some of the ppl were really weird like REALLY weird. but thats ok. random ppl were wandering around the house. david shan was there too.. then ok i have no clue what the order of events are but i got locked out of the house several times left cj in the locked garage for 15 min. that was funny played ping-pong [thank god it wasnt strip pingpong like some of the other ppl were playing] cause i lost 50-30 to carl ran around the house alot trying to get my shoes back stole shoes and wore them around the house threw a snowball in the house had a whipped cream fight that i think i kinda started with me throwing it...war ended with "me" punching jeanelle in the nose.. having like the whole bottle on my,stevens,and carls head. hahahhaha that was funny talked to random ppl was scarred for life by some random dancing i continued to eat throughout the night despite the fact that i had a huge stomach ache.  jeanelle and me drove carl and steve home and that was interesting.. and then i came home and like passed out on jeanelles floor at like 2 and then i woke up like alot from 2. one time jeanelle walked in turned the light on said "kate, we're drunk" and then left. or maybe i just fell back asleep then i heard someone go "lori, lori where are you, i want yogurt" and that was funny. then like everytime i fell asleep and someone would walk in theyd whisper "sorry kate" yeup i'll finish this rec. later well then i woke up at 5 then 7 for no particular reason went downstairs at like 7:30 cause i was sleeping on jeanelles floor..and then i had cereal[honey nut cherrios] the milk was good right jen? haha then we had pancakes and i got ready and we talked {me.jen.joel.lori.jen L.larissa.denise.jeanelle} cause we all stayed over then i went to church and i read the thing. and if jen and joel were there they wouldve made me laugh. and then we sat tehre and i was dying of boredom and tiredness. THEN i went to my grandmas and al i wanted to do was go home. so we had lunch cause it was my uncles birthday and my aunt was in florida so it was just me,col,grandma, dad,mom,josh jessi and except my  mom came late cause she was in LI and then josh threw up. that was gross. oh yeah yesterday when i was with my dad and we were going to droip off my sister at her friends house in garnerville we decided to stop at my grandmas house cause they live like practically nextdoor and we saw my uncles car in her street so I park the car and we walk into the house "hello hello is anyone home" then a lot louder "helloooo" dad,"noones home?" ::i walk around the house:: theres uncle tim lying on the couch with the ncaas on snoring soo loud.. he was out cold an dthen we left..yeah idk what that was for but ok.. and then i went home for like 10 minutes and then i left to go see the play.. did i forget to mention i hadnt showered since the day b4 right after practice.. so i had whipped cream in my hair and w.e else it was sooo gross anywas jen too.. then me and jen saw the play veronica was sooo good and so was kelly. and then i saw them after the play and talked to them.. and im so going to marry the 2nd grader who played gavroche he was sooo cute. and the play was good yup and then i came home and decided not to go 2 yg besides the fact that my parents def. wouldnt drive me there. and so i did some homework.. tommorow should be fun cause i have this huge french project i "forgot"to do and yeah...

      ok before i recap my day id just like to say how freak ing gay people in our school are. theres this weird kid  who keeps calling me a b*tch i have no idea   what i ever did besides not give him my phone number; i dont even know who he is and it really   pi s s  es me off and its just so dumb --  and i really dont want this to keep happening so i figured id just switch the way to go to class but thats dumb to cause these retards just call wanna call me a bit ch. anyways:  1st period - my insturment was stoled.. STUPID FRESHMAN!!  2nd period - it was really ghetto my teacher split the class into like the 15 ppl who were taking this test and the 5 people [including me] who werent-- and we got to watch a movie and they learned french.. but dont we need to know french too? oh well i dont mind  3rd period - math i think i get it i think i get it i think i get it .. no wait i dont ...  4th period - lunch GUMMY BEARS.. you know you wanna hit that hahaha  5th period - american history, got locked in the classroom by eileen  6th period - fisixs ew  7th period - DOUBLE PERIOD AHH  8th period - this makes no sense our teacher made us write essays in class and i completely bsed my and its has good excellent written all over it and she then had to go around the class and explain her comments so this is what she says to me: oh your essay was good oh this was an excellent quote great conclusion .. i was like yeah.. im pretty sure i could read that.. oh well it was like a free period 9th period- nhs meeting talked to jen for awhile.. we found jens bottle capp! haha practice-- hurdled a bit with steph.jess.kt.cant spell     s name. and sam mindich then did 10x 200s.. except when we started the other     s were on number 5.. so we ran them and then all the other     s except our group left then we did our 200s the beginnig we started in like 33 and then tried to go slower cause we were supposed to be getting like 36 but i dont think we ever hit that.. i think 35 was my slowest.  and they hurt cause i had pash and digs pace me but it was also funny cause coach baloga was doing steeple practice and he was like "announcing" me and pash's 200 and then then next one he was like GO GET HIM!! haha it was funny so then we ran the last few  in like 31's at the end  owww my legs hurt now. then me and steph did a really niiice slow cooldown. and then we did situps and pushups but i was so tard that didnt work well and besides we had already missed like half of them and soo then while i was waiting i talked to phil about "grr" and he took a picture on his phone haha it  prolly looked funny. then i camehome and i was gonna take a shower like an hour ago but instead im typing this up owell im a looser and i dont feel like getting up.. you know what that means im going to like eat my weight in food later and then go to sleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep..  note to jen-- GOD  oh and im reading at church on sunday.. i will not throw up on the bible..

      There are those who choose to take the easy road. and there are those who find something in their life to hunt after.  They are us.  We work everyday, our bodies and our minds.  For one moment-the finish line.  We all struggle with the feet coming behind us, and the many shoulders before us.  We will go hard, strong, and tough into every race.  We are runners, and with each other, we will always win.

      lets see in the past 48 hours i have eaten half my body weight, done no homework, watched lots of tv, and slept more then i slept all last week, and been completely bored out of my MIND ahh i could do a quick run through of the day but since i havent done anything interesting so i dont see the point in it. ive spent alot of time debating about the jr. prom.. cause the packets due march 10th.. and im def. not going to know alot of things by then. 1st- i dont wanna go by myself.. 2nd- i wanna go to penn relays really really bad but idk if im going till like april and i dont wanna like have a date and be like "oh sorry i cant go to the prom" or buy a dress and then never wear it, or pay for stuff and then it all be a waste of money but i also dont wanna like not do all of that and find out im not going to penn relays and just like sit on my butt at home while all of my friends are at the prom--  LeaVe me suggestions   ok i there are these     s in my physics class i wont say who cause yeah that could be bad, but anyways they talk all period and are really rude and mr.leung is always like "could you please be quiet" and they arent and they are SO rude it amazes me and we dont learn anything in that class cause everyones always talking he spends like the whole period shutting the class up and it drives me crazy, mr. leungs really nice my class is just a buncha smart people who only care about themselves cause they could like pay attention for one class and understand it. so anyways today we get to class and mr.leungs like alright we have a quiz tommorow and im like ok w/e.. and then those 2     s go off on him and are having like PMS attacks and screaming at the class 2 shut up its so hypocritical it makes me so mad how self centered those people are and you would think they would have some respect sweeing that they are both in the top 20 in the school i htink but holy      those people make me mad so anyways our class goes like something like this--mr. swiches chris to the stools cause hes being loud chris frank: i dont like sitting on the stools pat: what you got a fear of heights and then class laughs for like 5 minuets and mr.leungs like GENTLEMAN PLEASE bahhh i got to stop the negative NRG    i'll post something more interesTing Later

        You're chocolate.  You're the old soul type, people feel that they have known you their entire life.  Many often open up to you for they view you as thoughtful and trustworthy.  Although people trust you, you have a hard time trusting them.  You prefer to keep your feelings bottled up inside, or display them very quietly.  It is alright to open up every once in a while.    urlLink   Which kind of candy are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     how true how true

      today went from good to bad -- i swear to god my days are like good when its sunny out and bad when its rainy and dark and dreary out it so weird.. well this morning i woke up at like 6:30 and i got ready to go help little kids and that was fun me and denise were the finish line then me and jenna watched the 5k and were the traffic directors.. we did an awesome job.. and then i stayed for the award cermony so i could get more community service hours so then i talked to larissa and heard how upset she was and i really feel bad for her cause jens her friend and yeah.. i understand how larissa feels. but then again i see jens side too so this whole thing really sucks and im mad that theyre fighting cause they are both my good friends so w.e well see what happens but after today i never want to talk about there fight again. so anyways then i came home talked to jeanelle told her how bored i was and yeah and yeah then she left and so did cj and then i guessed that her and cj were going out and they were and yeah.. lets not even go there so i went to sleep and they called me and woke me up yeah... im going to leave some sh*t out cause it got me very mad cause it was freaking dumb. anyways glen picked me up and we picked jen up and then drove 2 yg. got there and realized how much im going 2 miss yg.. and i felt like his whole sermon was like explaining why he was leaving or w.e idk its weird  i still dont get why he wants to leave. in my opinion the yg is going to fall apart cause he is such a strong leader.. or idk thats just what i think. then jen and glen dropped me off and i came home.. yeah so w.e im in a really bad mood like this whole day i was like so sad and lonely it was really weird

      well we didnt go to the city afterall tho i really really really wanted to cause once the prom was over i was like wide awake and hyper. lets see i havent really been home much at all weds. we left for penn relays we took a bus to this little  inn or w.e in mount laurel NJ called the mcintosh and then we "segregated ourselves" lol steph,jenna,amanda, and me all stayed in one room yvanna,cathy,kinikia, and ash all stayed in the other--went out to bennigans that was fun yvanna was making us all have stomach aches from laughing so hard. and we kept getting evil looks from digs who was at the other table cause he thought we were being disruptive i guess haha..then i had 2 an ice bath grr for my legs while everyone was in theo the other hotel room we went to bed at like 11 i guess. woke up took a shower went to dennys bough OJ for 2.07$ thats crazy. then we got on the bus and went to penn. got therre snook in so we didnt hafta wait on this huge line and that sat there till 2 when we started to warm up.. saw some hotdogs in the drexel campus and somehow we got into this like soccer place that you supposedly needed ID to get into. woo.. then we got into the pens or w.e they call it and we stoood there for like 30min with other hot sweaty gir ls really squished togerther cause there was like 55 heats of the 4x4 and so we were all sqished so eventually we get to like the first thing or w.e and we found one of the officials from noRock. but noone recognized him cept me. but i didnt know his name. and then we raaced and there were like 2-3 teams under 4:00 i think or soomething like that and i was like woah we were in a fast heat. and then idk what i ran but amanda c. ran 59.7! but then we watched some other teams and one      ran 51. something thats like a guys time and that team ran like 3:39.98 wooooah thats fast. but what was really funny is thta when you finish they are like stand up stand up and they like coach you with your breathing and whatnot and they walk you over and then hand you some bottled water ahh so we left later and whatnot it was fun i'll never look at BBq sauce w/o chuckling.  then yesterday was the jr.prom or actually the jr.dance that was fun. then we went to angelas instead of the city... but thats ok basically sat around jen sat on me and i listened to her and glens convo then we went downstairs and me and jen laid on adam  then today i watched my cousins and then went to giuliettes confermation party and talked to people form the block tara ginty. ..and jenna listened to some jokes from guiles cousin "when did the squirrel cross the road?".. if you want the rest of that just ask me and i wanna go out tonight but i probably wont so i'll leave my day at that maybe i'll put some pictures of the jr. prom on here..

      before i went to risen king alliance church i really had no one that i looked up to in terms of learning how to have a relationship with God. when i went to risen king i was a little unsure of myself but nick and katie made me feel so welcome, that was about 1 year 4 months ago. and now they are leaving, they are goin to joels church in bedminster. and i am so upset. i feel really comfortable with them. and i really wanted nick to come to LIFE. LIFE was going to be so amazing and now i kno it will be but i want nick to come. my mom was like half asleep when i came home but she was like good nite and i was like goodnite and she knew by my voice something was wrong and tomora she will ask me and watch me now not be able to go or something cuz shes dumb like that. and she'll be like "nick is supposed to go blah blah blah". i really wish nick wouldnt leave and i understand he needs change its jus hard for my to accept. nick has amazing sermons week after week and manages everything. without him youth group is guna suck and ughhhh. my life hasnt been that great lately and now nick and katie are leaving................................................................................................................ :'(

      i ran like 5 or 6 miles today and was completely unmotivated so i kept walkin even tho i didnt hurt at all. i jus had no desire to do it. its for crew and i jus want to go to the hudson already. ugh i cant wait til we get the oars.  this morning i woke up and couldnt see and was so dizzy and felt sick to my stomach and i went back to bed and was planning on stayin home but then i woke up at 10 and felt fine and needed to take this history test and i didnt want to miss crew so i went to school late and my dad writes me a note as follows: (so i dont get detention) To Whom It May Concern: Please excuse Jennifer Kempton for her lateness. She was gettin over a cold and with the extra rest she is now ready to resume her studies. TJ Kempton  i told him jus to say i was at the docs or somethin but he said we shouldnt lie meanwhile normally my dad isnt a good person at all and that letter was funny neway cuz i didnt have a cold...w/e... tomora is already friday, this week went fast...school is guna finish up fast... :-)

      happy easter a day later! i spent the whole sunday in long island but it was fun even though i didnt think it would be so of course we leave the house 20minutes later then we wanted to so my dad was driving real fast down the LIE or w/e road it was to get to my grandma and grandpas church.. so we got there basically on time but the seats were already all filled so we got to sit on folding chairs right next to my grandma who plays the organ at church.. shes been playing there for like over 35 years and they are moving and gonna hafta switch churches and everyone [after church] was telling me how heartbroken the church was going to be. so anyways the service was good i like their church better then ours but owell so then after church i met all these interesting people that knew my mom when she was little or remembered me from when we occasionally went there they all asked like the same thing "what college are you looking at?" "what would you like to major in" it was really cool.. then i was informed that they are having a suprise party for my grandparents at this guy named hiltons house, i remember him from like when he was younger from going to church there a few times it was soo funny hes like my age and wayy taller then me and definately a hotdog haha jen.. so anyways his house has like an inground pool, a cabanna etc. soo that should be nice practice today wasnt very fun, neither was getting up for school we did 400 w. 4 or 5 hurdles in a row but of course at the end then a 600 the same way.. 200 all out.. 200 all out w/hurdles.. 400 all ou.. 200 all out 200 all out.. a 200 acceleration and another all out 400 umm.. not fun especially the fact that only some of us {me&carolyn WOOO, jade&KT, steph&ashley} those were our partners too had to run over the hurdles my grandma left me a huge bag of candy .. YAY more candy :) i love easter --KateR

      lets see i havent updated in a while... well this weekend i went to PA for regionals-baton competition...i left at like 3:30 on friday and it took us 4 hours to get there. saturday i had solos...i got disqualified from one of my solos and that was so dumb cuz i would have gotten 4th. i like went to get my sheet back with the results and all the points and everything on my sheet is like crossed off and the judge wrote on the top "i assume you are not in the competition blah blah blah" and other stuff u ppl wouldnt understand. i got 2nd in flag and 5th in 2 baton. i was in a gym for like 8 hours taht day. then the next day i had teams...i got 1st in two different teams and 5th in the other..then we went off to perform in hersey park and all these ppl where looking at us and it was fun ha. and then i went on some rides. i went on the new rollercoaster called like storm runner or something and it goes from 0 to 72 mph in 2 seconds..it was cool. but i wanted to go on all these other rides but then i didnt cuz we had to leave at like 7:30 cuz it was a long ride back but it only ended up taking 3 hours. last time i was in hersey was like in 6th grade and it was raining when i went to the park and my mom wouldnt let me go on any rides. as interesting as all this must be i must go. im so bored so i dont see where im goin but people are pissing me off online. neway i am now a 2 time regional champion wooot. i think there is only like 9 days of school left, thats the only positive thing i can think of rite now. and i mite go to cali wit jeanelle even tho she prob. hates me rite now...and i used to like the internet but now i really hate it cuz it causes ppl to fight. ne how i was really dizzy at the comp. on sat. i hope im not like gettin sicker.

      i think im going to write my speech on the effects coaches actions have on their athletes.. cause seriously coaches play a big part of an athletes like life.. they can either make them feel really good and pumped up and what not or they can make them feel like s hit .. ive def. experienced both.  anyways idk why i thought of this but i did  so idk lately i havent been sleeping for like the past 2 weeks ive been going to sleep late and waking up like every 1-3 hours its not good.. idk why i cant sleep anymore.. its not good though  cause its made me like really moody or w.e for example i started like hysterically crying in the movies yesterday  today at yg i really liked nicks sermon cause its def. true everytime something bad happens i ask god why? why me? and it really hit me cause lately ive been feeling really upset and hurt and i always ask god why me? or like when i look at myself and see how tall i am im always like why do i hafta be tall god? whyd you make me like that.. idk so i really liked his sermon.. its a very selfish thing to do. and i should look at things in a different perspective even tho its hard. so yeah that was good. we also played ultimate frisbee and that was alot of fun and we won.. even tho the people on my team were mad    ists and not bad at frisbee. then we went inside then we got chocolate and i ate waaay to much and now i feel hungover.   wow.. is the word of the day.. wow.. wow.. wow.. yeah wow.. WOW WOW WOW so yes  nicks taking me and jen to panara bread

      i should be studying lol well schools finally ove im so happy :)  this weeks been up and down and up and down so what i would like to say is Im going to miss the seniors soo soo much its going to be so weird walking into next year and not seeing all my friend and not having everyone at track and Xc  there. And even weirder is that im going to walk into tha school and we're going to be the oldest in the school. But anyways im going to miss the track     s the most. Stick!??! what am i going to do without my other half, tracks not going to be the same w/o her every year shes been there for me to talk to and just to random dumb things with like going to carols, opening the bathrooms etc. and amanda c. im going to miss her too cause we've spent this year basically running together. but hopefully i'll run with them both over the summer. Im really going to miss all the seniors this year.    and she will be loved  oh i love that maroon 5 song.

      last week went by fast until thursday nite when my mom was supposed to take me driving but she wasnt feeling well so my dad picked me up and then he was in a pretty good mood so i was like ok we can go and practice parallel parking. so we go to the high school and then he does it once and then i do it and i do it good and then hes like do it again and i do and i mess up and he starts like screaming at me and i wasnt in the mood for that so i was like ok well we can jus go home and i get outta the car cuz i thought he was guna drive home and then he was like if u dont finish this im leaving u and im like well im not finishing this so he speeds off and leaves me there...lovely father huh...so i start walking home and call my mom and shes like spazing out and then who turns the corner but my 2 angels kate and her mom hehe they have been there for me other times when my family has driven me nuts. so they drive me home. its lucky that they were driving that way cuz they were coming back from buying the blink 182/no doubt tickets.  so friday nite definately made up for this mess cuz me jeanelle and kate saw blink and no doubt and it rocked!  woooooooooooooooooooooooooooo it was really good and we were really near gwen and me and kate jumped like 2 fences b4 blink came on to get closer cuz we had lawn tickets. jeanelle eventually jumped the fence but went back, i wish she stayed. i got her the ticket for her bday. brian and adam were closer than us and adam ended up catchin travis' drum stick. and i saw him catch it too. he was so happy, im happy for him. so we didnt get home til like 2, well to kates house neway and we all slept there and me and jeanelle went to syracuse the next day, 4 hour drive each way. and i was in a car last weekend a lot for PA and like 1-2 hours each way to holmdel for the concert but its all good. so saturday nite i went to bed early and sunday i went to church and me jimmy and avian watched sammy haha and then i went to the nanuet mall wit my mom and got some cheap tanks from mandees for CA and AZ and everything and then we went to the palisades mall and ate at chilis and i got a cute skirt (i kno cute and skirt in the same sentence stated by me its odd) and then we saw the movie day after tomora and it was soo good and then i went to yg a lil late, the worship band rocked and riguel talked and he rocked and holly and joy were there and then i left early to practice parallel parking and  then today i had my road test at 1 and i passed   hollah but my mom is all like probably not guna let me drive..hmm well i only went back to school to go to the stupid honor society meeting that got cancelled neway but oh well i came back to school and told eric (who also passed at like 10 today), lori, laura, alex, kate, glen, jes, jimmy, cj, kelly and everyone that i passed...glen didnt think i would pass so ha! and booya to my dad! i still have to tell adam and jeanelle and joel and marcie and ppl..wooo so i think these past few days have been pretty good considering how everything else has been for me with a lot of stress from school and home... yea i dont kno if i posted this or not but for all u that dont kno glen broke up wit me like a week ago or something... :-/  nehow ill stop talking now since ur probably bored to death tori- i cant wait til ur party tomora!

      BLINK 182 AND NO DOUBT WERE AWESOME!!! omg .. so was that whole day well the night started out with me jen and jeanelle leaving around 4:00 or so in her mini cooperr. we listened to the blink 182 and no doubt mix that i made and then carl called and somehow we ended up talking to this guy chub?? whos chub? lmao "what? what? what?" haha then we were driving and we saw 'sexi boys' and they were videotaping stuff so me and jen wanted to be in their video so we caught up to them and they stared at us for awhile and then i think we got on their video tape cept the guy holding the camera wason the other side. so then they sped off and we decided to chase the    i boys ahhaha . so we got to the concert after a few debacles at about 6:30.. bought some clothes. got tons a free stuff. then we decided to go find our "seats" which was really the lawn. and so we arrived and we werent actually that far back and so this band the living end opened they were ok. then during the set change or w.e we talked to adam and  brian who were like alllll the way in the front.. not fair at all!!! so then they left and no doubt came on and GWEN STEFANI was like RIGHT in front of us cause she wasnt on the stage!! so that was cool and then they played a few songs and some     s were hopping the fence so we got the idea that we should do that too so that we could be closer.. cept there were these like guards who were watching with yellow coats. so during one of the songs jen jumps over and no one sees her so 2 songs later i jump over and supposedly the guy saw me but i didnt get caught to i ran down and found jen and we were pretty close by then so it was awesome. then no doubt was just awesome.. and jeanelle never came.. which was sadl.. and then we stood there with the rest of the people that hopped the fence i think cause they didnt have seats. and then they stopped and during the set change we hopped another fence so that we could get to brian and adam or get them 2 sneak us in with their tickets  but they wouldnt let us. w/e. so blink 182 came on and we found a new spot to stand a little closer by handicap seats. and yeah blink 182 was sooooo sooo so so so sos os sosososoossooso oooooooooooooooo amazing omg i could go on and on and on about why it was so good but i dont feel like it so just trust me on that..  so the way home was interesting it was like hyper!!! tired HYPER!!! driving like 80 raceing the    i boys [not brian and adam] yeah i heard your comment yesterday.. and we were dancing in the car and we rolled our windows down and it was cold but fun and then this guy was like out the window it was really funny then we got lost. and yeah so much fun its not fair that i couldnt go up with them to syracuse.. BOOO

      -pash  well lets see how have i been.. well the bigger question is how have YOU fellow readers been.. tho im sure not many people if at all any read this, but its all good i like keeping track of what ive been up to.  so i dont know where to start so i'll just start at the half day fri: :) woo half day!!! and i did like absolutely nothing no joke. then i had the longest practice ever and we did like nothing..  HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED BEING A GROUNDSKEEPER  omg that was funny.. if i do say so myself.. sat at home then went to carls house "cleaned" went to the mall with jeanelle and carl.. pda thats all i hafta say.... oh and i bought my dad a  fathers day gift and carl looked for a fathers day present for his gpa. lmao -- then we went to hogans and sung jeanelle happy birthday well lets restate that me and some random lady sung jeanelle happy birthday carl just kinda sat there and stared into space sat. was the meet way to long of a bus ride to arlington. then i ran the 200 in 27.6 i was pretty happy with that time seeing that i even started standing up and i was in lane 7 out of 8. yup weird then i sat aroun d and watched people run good times and qualify for the state meet and it made me all hyper and ready to race.. and then came the 4x400 and i  was hyper ready to go out there and run my 60.8.. and we had a shot at qualify for states too. well that didnt work out well but AC did run 57.8 which is crazt fast. i felt bad that the rest of her team choked. anyways then i sat at home and slept i think,, sunday: brothers confirmation.. i felt like the proud older sister.. my brother has changed so much and so have all his friends it so weird. then i came home took a zillion pictures.. then my mom and dads family came over for a bbq. so it was nice and loud and i had fun talking with my family and so yeah it was actually cool-- played basketball and it breaks my dads heart i can tell  monday: HAPPY memorial day. went to the vitales bbq party despite the dreary weather and talked to allison shawna and their friend izzy and allisons b/f i cant remember his name and sean calder a little and amanda from french! it was fun cold and wet but fun   Today one waitress outside of the phonebooth south carlina i dont know how to let it go this far away from home   good song well we got our XC scheds and stuff

      i was in cali for 3 weeks and it was amazing. the weather is so nice, except the last few days where close to a 100 but the rest of the time it was like 70s and 80s and no humidity. we went to the san diego zoo and i got to see the pandas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! woo i wanted to like all my life. and they were so cute i cant wait to get my pix developed. i went to hollywood and beverly hills and two beaches, laguna and oceanside, and to knotts berry amusement park (farm). its so sad to be back, no offense but its amazing there.&nbsp;i was there helpin jeanelle move in. she lives in this huge house in temecula, an hour away from san diego. i have like three rolls of film to get developed and ill somehow get some pix up on the site. neway today was good to see some ppl, kate lori and melissa and tonite im seeing laura and marcie. i got my nails done today and now they are all short cuz they lady cut them cuz some of them were broken from cali. im kinda still on cali time and so its like 3 hours earlier for me then it is for you. so im kinda tired n confused and once i start to adjust im goin to arizona so then ill be on that time oh boy. i leave for arizona the 26th so u all should see me b4 then. i kinda got a lil tan. i cant wait to go back to cali and hopefully next time jeanelle wont be so obssesed with talkin to cj, she was seriously on the phone wit him or text messaging him so much. sorry jeanelle but u kno how i feel about this. i spent 400 bucks of my own money to fly out there and shes talking to him more than me. but mayb i should go shower or something cuz i smell and im leaving soon i think...post a comment!

      sunday: showed up at cjs, then phil did the same thing., vivi was gonna come but her mommy dragged her to the mallie :(.. hungout and talked to skanky then went swimming, cj decided to do a dmr. 5  laps, 3laps, 1 lap it was seriosly the funniest thing ever. cause cj did the 5 and phil was supposed to do the 3 and i was doing th 1 and so we kept messing up cjs relay after she did the 5.. i think we eventually did it. then we swam or w.e and then phil and cj decided they wnated to get the kicking record so i decided to also and me and phil tied at 22minutes cause it got really boring and we beat cj like twice. anyways then we ate some pizza and hungout smore and then they dropped me off at the HS so i could run with viv and they were running lata.. so me and vivi didnt really run all that hard cuase like 5 minutes into it we were playing tag, then we ran smore and saw cj driving phils car lmao. then  we ran into stick and idk we ended up stopping a lot but thats ok   monday: cant remember so probably nothing interesting.. went running wiht vivi later i think.. i like running with gansta vivi  yesterday: went to the mall saw chrissy and sammy.. then went to practice and did somewhat of a wrkout it wasnt that bad but it wasnt easy.. i ran with BC like a nice warmup then a mile of straights and curves, 2 paced quaters with 90 second rest and then a cool down.  today:soo happy, been happy since i passed couldnt stop smiling.. probably looked like an idiot oh well lmao.. well lets see i woke up this morning and realized that the guy was picking me up at 12:30 and then i realized that jesse spinas funeral was at 11:30 :( and i didnt know what to do and my mom wasnt home so i took the roadtest even though i feel incredibly bad and guilty that i missed his funeral.. he was cool event though i only met him 4 or 5 times.. one time i went to his house with the yg that was alot of fun i'll never forget him n the guy tryin to flip jen and me over inner tubes cuase we were doing     s v. guys and we got our nickname mary*kate.. its really sad that at 14 he died of cancer but now hes in a better place w/o hospitals and stuff..  anways i got there really early and it was weird cause one of the other people taking their roadtest with roger was a senior at norock and i had never seen her in my life and im not going to cause shes moving to florida.. but she got the mean guy and failed :(.. then i got this jolly fat guy.. i mean that in the nicest way.. and he passed me and didnt take any points off i went from 85 point to zero lmao weird. so i was soo nervous that i was nervous after my roadtest that when you sign this paper i was shaking.. he told me i was going to slow but i couldnt go faster lmao. then i came home and i called jeanelle and jen and i was fought over :D i feeled so loved. then i went online and imed like every person on my b.l haha that i passed. and then i was like i wanna go driving so then i decided to pick phil up and then we went to jeffs house and cj was there and we were there for a bit and then we decided to go to the nanuet mall i felt mad dumb tho cause i had no idea how to get there.. i still think if i went id get lost.. but anyways we were driving and coach bologa called cj which was really weird and then he talked to phil and jeff too -- anyways we got to the mall and walked around.-- then we walked outside im not exactly sure why but anyways we went back to jeffs 2 play pool but then it was closed so we went to vivis house and we chilled their for awhile then i drove them back to phils house and went home. Then i left like 15 minutes later 2 go running with "the viv" as cj was calling her lmao i did a wonderful job parking at the HS lmao .. and went running with the gangsta we were gonna hop some fences but they were a bit slippery from the rain. then i drove home, like shoved down a huge box of mac and cheese, beans and a potatoe cause i hadnt eaten since that morning at like 10. then my brother begged me to take him to the video store so i did cause im a good sister, then i had to drive my sisters friend home which i didnt mind cause shes cool but i just didnt feel like driving there.. so i did alot of driving today but thats ok cause i like it specially when your by yourself and you can blast music, play your own station, and have the car as warm and cold as you want.. holla so im veryy happy that i passed

      i left my heart in california on the sand under the sun, i fell in love with the pacific ocean and the suntanned surfers. haha my hollister tee is soo right.  anyways let me recap my days in cali  tuesday - me and my sister arrived after a long flight and delays. first we sat on the runway at LGA for 45 minutes, then when we got to dallas we hit a lot of turbulance and the pilot completely freaked me out when he kept telling us we were landing even though it was stormy, then we landed got off even though we coulda satyed on and found our we were delayed and so we got pizza and food and some other stuff and after 2.5 hours we got back on our plane and then sat on the runway for another half hour and then after flyiing for a little less then 2 and a half hours we arrived in california orange county. And i realized i really like flying, i shot the window seat so i like stared out the window desert, found a whole lot of tracks and baseball fields, i wish i knew where i was tho when we were flying. so we got to the airport and my cousins are all standing there and they rushed up to me and gave me huge hugs omg i love them soo much theyre so cute lauryn- is 10, erin is 7 and brendan is almost 5. got back to there mansion, in a gated community. and had my own room, bathroom and closet!! fell asleep at like 7 their time cause i was tired from waking up at 5 this morning  weds. ,- wild animal park, interesting got pooped on my head my some bird, it was gross. got to see some parts of san diego, and some random stuff jen my moms cousin sarcastically, "oh my, if i knew their were t-rexes i wouldnt have come" to some little kid who was telling her about dino mountain.   thurs-  collin, tristin, shannon came over and we went swimming, somehow we got playing a game called attack kate.. and it ended up being everyone spraying water with me even brendan and shannon the 4 year olds, then we   fri-  laguna beach, saw a            , went to newport, and balboa islands, jen was making me hysterical cause she we had to go on a like 50 foot ferry to go to balboa and she was like ohh i love ferrys they make me so happy omg i think you had to be there but it was hillarious then went to the pool oh man that was one of my fav. days, then we ended up going to a concert which was really cool and i attempted to swing dance with my cousins it was fun i probably looked like a fool but i dont really care cause im never going to see like any of the ppl again.   sat-  farted around till about 1, ended up going back to the beach meeting up with the waselys my moms cousins the most beautiful beach ever, almost got stung by this HUGE jellyfish which was weird cause ive never seen a jelly in the pacific ocean only the atlanic then the lifeguard put it in a bucket and then let it go somewhere else,went back home and went to the pool swam  sun-  4th of JULY yay!! went to a carnival and went on the most awesome ferris wheel ever. noticed that most of the guys look like theyre from the 80s which was really weird, and that alot of ppl had converse shoes, so i think im gonna buy me a pair, went on some other rides too.. lots of fun. then we came home BBQed i was lifeguard, waselys came over and tristan got me soaking wet cause he wanted me to get in the pool, then we saw one of the best firework shoes ever holler it was cool mon- went to san juan capistrano which was beautiful, san clemente, also beautiful i mean SoCo is soo nice i wanna move there, then we went to a waterpark and that was fun, the best was this like long slide thing with mats and its a 7 person race. i went on it alot of times, the first time it was me my sister and two college people and i had no idea wat i was doing but i didnt want to loose i ended up coming in third but what was hillarious was my sister started after me cause she didnt push of good and i get to the second bumb and i see this orange thing          past me that was really funny, then the second time we went on i got like second or something and this guy was like i beat the tall     , weird, and i went on a few more time w/ my sis one time i completely wiped out and went like 20 feet w/o my matt which hurt and then we did some other ride and then collin, tristin, erin, lauryn, dick we online to do the water slide race so we sprinted to get with them cause 7 people can go but somehow we got sepertaed so they all go and then i go and my sister are together and were with a whole group of guys and i wanted to beat them even though i knew i prolly couldnt cause they were all heavier then me, so i like went as far as i could down the slide and still have my feet on the wood but i ended up slipping and looking like an idiot cause i went way b4 everyone else and then all the little kids at the bottom told me how i went to early hahaha. then i went again with all my cousins and i beat them all, probably cuase theu all weigh like 50 pounds lol idk.. then i was going to go on the toilet bowl with erin and collin cause its like supposed to be the scariest one but it looked rreally cool, we were the last ones 2 be let up there so i talked to the lifeguard for awhile, and then he tells me that i cant go on the ride cause i have cotton shorts.. grr .. so i didnt go on it but it looked like alot of fun.   tues-  drove to la jolla in san diego which im in love with, then went back to san clemente and went on the pier and saw a lot of hot surfers wed- came home :( not a fun trip, ended up getting delayed in dallas again cause of storms to the west of NY and the cancelled all flights except like ours which was delayed and the guy said at least four hours ahh.. and so me and my sis walked around and planned what we were going to do if they cancelled us; eat at chilis, get the train, find a hotel. i really wanted to be cancelled. well we got home around 1. but when we were flying to LGA was soo cool cause we flew right over NYC and the lights were all on and it was pretty, specially cause we were really close to them cause we were landing well that was a mad fun trip im gonna put pictures up here i think .
