      I can’t believe nobody has posted in my guestbook since Tuesday! You are obviously all snoring soundly….. Glad my blog has some uses.    Had a guest service at church tonight and I took my flatmate Lisa.  Was quite accessible and interesting, but um... I actually disagreed with quite a lot of what the speaker said.  Well not necessarily disagreed but just don’t think he gave the full picture.  He painted everything in a rather rosy light, like if you become a Christian life will be perfect, everything will be wonderful and you will never have any problems ever again.  He was talking about how people have a need, a longing for something more than us.  No matter how much material wealth we have it will not make us happy. Ok so far. Then he said how God fills that space, how Jesus comes in and makes us complete and we will never be lonely again.   Um…   Then he said that if we have accepted the gift God is offering us, then his spirit will come and live in us and we will know the truth and we will realise and understand our worth, our identity, how much he loves us and everything. So does that mean that if we don’t realise those things, don’t understand them, don’t believe them, we have really accepted God?  We don’t really believe?    Then Lisa was asking me some questions about how do we know Jesus was the Son of God, not just a mad man, and I couldn’t answer properly. What if I never really believed? What if I didn’t accept the gift God was offering?    He said that it is like a broken computer. We try and press different buttons, fiddle with various wires, but nothing works because it is not plugged into the wall.  It is not attached to the power supply.  He said it was the same as life and Christianity.  We try and fiddle with things, fill our lives with stuff, but nothing will work unless we are ‘plugged in’.  Maybe that’s my problem – maybe I’ve got a dodgy connection.  Don’t feel really crap about this because know that he did just paint a rosy picture and there are loads of people who still feel lonely, doubt God’s love for them. But still has made me question stuff.

      Aaahhh woke up late this morning – as in 9:15 – and church STARTS at 9:15!! So arrived a tad late.  Then went to see Lizzy and James to discuss our Fairtrade Café plans.  We are hoping to be joined on board by another girl who has been managing the only Fairtrade Café in Birmingham since September.  She is now leaving there because of some problems there and wants to get on board with us.  She will now be our fountain of all knowledge!  The only scary thing is that as we discuss plans for this more and more, I also realise that I’ll need to find a real job then too – help! I’d really like to actually work in the café part time or something, but I’m not sure if we’ll make enough profit to cover that or what the others will think. We’ll have to see.    Have decided that there is no point in just feeling rubbish about something, if you can do something positive about it.  So I have written a letter to my tutor about the horrible mark and feedback I got for my learning diary. I have explained why I missed the sessions and also how I feel the comments are therefore unfair.  Wait to see what she says. But feel better for doing it.  Feel more in control, like I’m able to take charge of my circumstances.  Really feel like phoning Rachel today. Just want to chat. But I want to give her space, not appear too desperate or like I need her.  So I’m trying to ignore the urge.   Ok off to do some work – and I mean it today!  I absolutely HAVE to do some if I am going to be able to go away over Easter and not worry about it or do any.  Its really annoying that our clocks have gone forward because now we are 9 hours ahead of Vancouver, so managing to find a time when I can call Melanie and it not be in the middle of the night for her or me is increasingly difficult.  But only 19 days to go!  YYIIIIPPPPEEEE

      ok waiting for first side of trousers to dry!  Have got a pair of white painter’s dungarees and am painting colourful splodges all over.  NOT because I decided I needed some art therapy (although it does have that benefit) but ready for the Paint Factory – kids thing I am doing over Easter.  My splodges aren’t very even though!!  Had a wonderful day out with the kiddies.  I picked them up at 10:00am this morning and we went and picked up another girl and then went to Lizzy’s. We then set off down to the Licky Hills.  Played in the park, went on an adventure in the woods to find buried treasure (gummy bears hidden in my pocket!) and to search for our lunch – which handily appeared when we returned to the visitors centre! We learnt about what roots are and why trees need them (I thought my explanation of them being like straws that the tree sucks up the water through was fair enough, but everyone else seemed to find it rather funny), what stones are called when they grow up and become big, and that if you jump into mud too hard your wellies get stuck and you can’t get out!  The kids were great. Ruth who never shuts up at the moment, didn’t open her mouth the entire time we were with the others! She seemed happy enough, but just didn’t talk! Paul on the other hand, loves an audience and duly responded!  Think we totally shattered them and Ruth fell asleep on the way home, whilst Paul planned our next trip out.  He wants to go by bus, train and airplane next time!     Then went back and Hannah and I decorated my t-shirt, also for the Paint Factory.  She coped with well with the fact that she didn’t come, but I have been sent home with strict instructions to find out about buses for our next adventure!  NO bad things to report today – yippee!  Even had a decent chat with my mum on the phone.  Will write more later, but going to do the second side of my dungarees!

      Flatmates are preparing for another night out on the town. Its like 9:00pm, I’m thinking of heading to bed and they haven’t even left yet!  I feel SO old.  I mistakenly admitted on Wednesday at Navs that I have never actually been to a night-club. I just don’t see what people see in them.  Most people are totally inebriated and totally out of it.  You can’t talk to anyone, get to know people, or chat to friends.  Drinks cost a fortune and taste disgusting.  Sometimes I do like dancing – if you are with a whole group of friends and its good music, but the rest of the time I just feel totally self-conscious and bored stiff!    Anyway my day today has actually been quite good. I got up at 8:00 which pleased me and then headed into town to do some jobs.  I got my friend’s birthday present, an insulated mug with a lid (for Spring Harvest – can’t have hot drinks around kids in case they spill) and I there was a sale on in my favourite outdoor shop and they had this camelbag thing – have you heard of them? They are like water holders – I have a platypus one, but I wanted to get an attachment tube so that you can leave it in your rucksack and drink out of it.  I wanted one for skiing and other stuff and they were on sale. I got one that comes in this handy rucksack thing – except got it home and the seal isn’t good and so it leaks!  Never mind I’ll take it back next week.  I had a nice wonder round the bookshop ( I LOVE books) which I don’t often get time to do as I’m normally in a mad rush round town getting everything done on my list.    Then I came back home did some bits and bobs and went to look after the kiddies.  We did some finger painting today!  I love it, we made a right mess which the kids loved and I ended up clearing up – but it was cool.  Ruth (who is 2) and I did some singing and piano playing too whilst Paul (who is 4) surfed online on the Tweenies website!  He is an amazing kid on the computer.  Stayed until bathtime and then headed home.    But the best news of the day……Rachel called me!!! YYYYIIIIIPPPPPEEEEEE!!! Just chatted about random, superficial stuff but was SO good to talk.  I said I would call her at the end of the week.  Although part of me is still cross I guess that she wouldn’t take ANY responsibility for what happened, I have decided that our friendship is worth more to me than that, so I want to move on.  Initially I think I felt stung by a wasp and so was scared to go back in, but I’m going to take the risk. Its not going to be like before but maybe, just maybe we can have something.  And I have other people now too, so its ok.  Hey  maybe  that is why I met you when I did Mel, so that all this with Rachel could happen and I would cope….. God works in mysterious and crazy ways!!  Am off to the Lickie hills tomorrow with some girls from my small group at Navs. I am taking Paul and Ruth too, to give Jo a bit of a break.  Feel bit bad about not including Hannah (who is 6) but she is at a birthday party, so hopefully she won’t mind too much. Think I might do something special with her next week, but can’t think what.  Ok Granny goggins is off to have her coco before heading to bed with her hot water bottle!

      Oh man today has been a roller coaster of a day.    Bad things:   1. continued difficulties with Rachel – just felt like I was banging my head against a wall. What does she want from me?  2. stupid lecturer giving me 52% for my learning diary (We are supposed to write about what we learnt, how we learnt, what we didn’t learn, why etc. I wrote that I didn’t feel I learnt very much this module, that it was badly organised, and the content was pretty poor. Basically the lecturer obviously took this rather personally and gave me a crap mark for NO reason)  3. Got speeding ticket (there is this stretch that I drive EVERY day and it is 30mph, then 40mph, then 30mph and one day I obviously forgot which was which and did 40 in the 30 bit. Now I have £60 fine and 3 points on my license. And the majority of the time I do 30 and am being overtaken by everyone!)  Think Mel’s idea is good – and I will try and think of a positive thing for each of the bad things – not necessarily trying to think of the same thing but in a positive light, but another positive thing to counteract the negative.  Good things: 1.Helped flatmate and friend with their presentation on Fairtrade and it went well.  2. I emailed Rachel and said that we were getting nowhere and that we needed to forget, forgive and move on.  Even though I had told her all the way through, I repeated that I liked her, cared about her and wanted to be her friend.  She has just replied and although was really defensive initially, then got what I was saying and said ok. So hey we might be moving again.  Feels like a train that has been stuck in a tunnel for 3 weeks.  And hopefully we come out the other end of the tunnel, and although the scenery won’t be the same as it was before, maybe we can still keep moving forwards.  I also phoned her during the MJ gig (see next point) and just let her listen to one of the songs which had the words ‘I love you, I hope you realise that’.  Hope it helped.  3. Went to see Martyn Joseph tonight at St Martins in the Bullring (Ok Jules if you are reading this - stop being sick, he’s not like he was in your day!)  He is the amazingly cool guy who places guitar and sings.  He is a Christian and lots of songs are subtly about God and stuff, but they are mostly about real issues, real struggles, real life.  About things like the war in Iraq, the redundant miners in Wales, the plight of the landless in Brazil, about what God is really about.  They aren’t life is all wonderful and perfect, but life is sometimes crap, but we can make it, we can do it.  He sang this excellent song about waiting for Sunday.  How screwed up the world is, had terrible everything is, how we are on Friday still, but Sunday will come – he will keep his promises.   And his latest album is called ‘Whoever it was who brought me here will have to take me home’ and it’s a wonderful song – the words just spoke volumes to me, especially: “….I’m trying to work out what it is I should be, A dented saint searching for some sanctuary, I’m remembering grace, And things I hold dear, And whoever it was that brought me here will have to take me home.”   I sat in the church listening to this and just crying out to God.    Anyway, so although its been a bit crap, am feeling quite positive. I CAN do this. I’m going to have rubbish days, but it is worth it right? There WILL come a time when its not this hard right?  I think the thing is that I expected things to be better now, not to struggle at all, to be 100%, to be able to cope with anything and everything that life throws at me. But I don’t thing I am, I can. But that’s ok too I think.  Another of Martyn’s songs is about this guy who was on this expedition up some mountain – think it was Everest. Anyway he goes into a coma halfway down and his team have to leave him, because the chances are that he will die anyway. So they go, but he wakes up and realises that if he has any chance of living he will have to get up and walk down the mountain.  And this song was inspired by this, and how sometimes in life we need to get a different perspective on something, try and see something in a different way, in order to move forwards, to make it. We have to just lift up our heads and go for it. And the words are amazing so I’ll put them all here (sorry):  Looks like I’m ready Though its crazy I know There’s not a star in the stormy sky To guide me home And all this heavy baggage That brought me to this place Has left me high and stranded, staring at this face   I’m gonna walk down the mountain With my head in the sky I’m gonna walk down the mountain If I stay here I will die   Through static on the radio I try to talk where I can see But a gentle wisdom to survive It don’t always set you free   I’m gonna walk……    Goodnight all. Sweet dreams.

      Woke up this morning - well actually fortunately was woken by flatmate - because was in the middle of this horrible dream.  Things had got really bad again, and I wasn't coping and I kept trying to tell people but they wouldn't listen. They kept telling me that I was being silly, I should just go home and be a good girl, stop making a fuss. And I was shouting at them, crying, begging them to listen but they wouldn't.  I went to the GP and they wouldn't even let me see her.  The CPN just kept saying 'now come on Karen, just stop being so silly, you are making mountains out of molehills'.  And I was like running down the street chasing after this whole group of people, but they wouldn't stop. They glanced over their shoulders, looked at me and then turned and kept walking.  I couldn't get them to stop and help me. So anyway that freaked me out a bit.  Decided to have lay-in today and watched some TV. Morning TV is crap but I felt like just blobbing.  A friend gave me some of her diary to read last night. Which was cool because it means that she trusts me. Not sure I'm ready to do the same quite yet though. We'll see.

      My friend James and I did a social experiment at Navs tonight.  We had been discussing how we use ‘hi how are you?’ as a greeting not as we-actually-want-to-know-if-you-are-ok thing.  And we were saying how bizarre would it be if we did actually say how we really were, what would be people’s reactions?  Then I told him about what I had read in Mike Yaconelli’s book Messy Spirituality (thanks SO much Mel for recommending this – its SO amazing) where he talks about pretending being efficient, uncomplicated and quick. Answering fine to the question, ‘how are you?’ is far easier.  Honesty requires a huge amount of time and effort.  Mike says that pretending is the grease of modern non-relationships, the oil that allows us to perpetuate the illusion of relationships.  Pretending allows us to have relationships without actually having them. So James and I agreed that every time someone said ‘how are you?’ we would give them a real (well real-ish answer) So I used an adapted version of Mike’s example “well actually my back is aching, my friends are all not talking to me (partly true you see), I don’t like my body and actually I’m not sure that there is even such a thing as God.” Reactions were interesting and ranged from ‘yeah right’ to ‘oh I’m so sorry you’ve had such a bad day’ problem was I wasn’t very successful at keeping a straight face whilst doing it – so not too convincing.  But think we made people think and it was a bit of a laugh!!  Other than that day has been pretty normal. Went to my talk together group to look after 10 children under 3 (in fact 8 of them are under 18months!) whilst their mummies did Bible study and then helped my flatmate with her presentation, then went to a all-christian-groups-except-the-christian-union prayer meeting.  James and I were then going to work in the chaplaincy but ended up putting the worlds to rights instead.  Felt ok actually till about 10pm then it hit me and I sunk down again.  Lets hope the submarine surfaces tomorrow hey. Tomorrow is Thursday – which is battle day with the CPN – ugh.  See you soon. (I wonder how many people are actually reading this bizarre but apparently true tale of my woeful life???)

      ok am TRYING not to take it personally, but the girl who cancelled cathy burton, who cancelled lunch on sunday, has now just got up and left the minute I sat down next to her in the computer room.  I saw her and thought I won't go over and speak to her, but then thought don't be SO stupid Karen and so I went over. Asked her how she was and stuff.  She then had the audacity to say - "oh I haven't seen you in ages - where have you been?"!!!!!  She then asked how I was - and you'll be pleased to know that I didn't say fine. I said actually I have had a few crap weeks but hey I'm surviving.  She said we ought to meet up sometime.  I said well you need to decide when you are free and then sure just let me know.  So she said what about next week - and again I repeated - yeah you let me know when you are free and I'd love to see you.  So we'll have to wait and see what happens. She then said I have to go, packed up and left.  Um...just coincidence right?  But I'm not going to let it dampen my spirits - cos I'm coming to Canada!!

      wow have just realised that I have now written enough on this blog, that it isn't all on this page and is in the archives.  Goodness me.  Just wanted to apologise for my splurge last night. It scares me how quickly my feelings can change and how fast my thoughts gain power and control. Still feeling pretty crappy about those things, but am trying to gain some perspective on it all.  Also managed to wake up at 8am which made me proud of myself (am really struggling to get up at the moment as I'm not getting to sleep until late).    Nothing much of interest has happened today - just lectures and had impromptu meeting with Debs (cheers matey).  But then actually I went and played the piano for about an hour in the chaplaincy which was WONDERFUL. Just the therapy I needed.  I have discovered this lovely song 'Oh kneel me down again' and the chorus is cool - very real and not everything-is-perfect-when-you-know-God:  "You are the God of the broken, the friend of the weak; you wash the feet of the weary, embrace the ones in need. I want to be like you Jesus to have this heart in me. You are the God of the humble, you are the humble king"  And I played it over and over again! Made me feel far better.  Anyway am off to a MedSIN meeting now. More later...

      Ok who am I trying to kid? I think everything is going fine again, yeah I am doing this, I made it through the last rough week, yeah I can handle this, I can cope, I can do this. Like hell I can.  I should have just gone to the therapeutic community and been out of everyone’s way.  And I shouldn’t even be writing here, because ok you have the choice whether or not to read this, its not like I’m forcing you to listen to me, but on the other hand who on earth wants to listen to my waffle and crap? I mean its hardly exciting or seat-gripping stuff is it.  All you get is the pathetic, selfish out-pourings of my mouth.  The only thing is that I have nowhere else to put this.  I mean I could write like a paper blog right, but at least I have to be vaguely normal on here and can’t let me head go rampant like it does when I write. Used I am sort of safe here.  So what is my problem now? Well I reckon people are trying to say something to me  1.	The girl who cancelled the Cathy Burton thing and then again on Sunday  2.	Rachel hasn’t replied to my email I sent (and I know she has been online and picked it up) 3.	Have just found out that I may have to share a bed with Rachel when we go to Spring Harvest (I am doing a week of kids stuff and then am there as a guest with Rachel, Jon – her fiancée – and his youth group) which I DON’T want to do. I mean can you imagine anything worse than sharing a bed with someone who won’t even speak to you at the moment.   4.	Another girl who says she cares hasn’t been in touch for ages 5.	The fairtrade Easter egg disaster (which others say isn’t a disaster but they are not the one who screwed it up) 6.	Nothing which I REALLY want to happen, happens. Something always gets in the way – God supposedly has better plans – yeah right. 7.	and other stuff which I can’t say (see even though this place is supposed to be somewhere I can be really honest, I can’t because I have let certain people know about it. And although I could have not told anyone and then I could have written what I liked, there wouldn’t be much point because no-one would then read it. But then what is the point of anyone reading it anyway?????)    You see everyone keeps telling me that people will still like/love me, if I show them the real me. That they won’t run a mile.  But to the few people I have shown the real me (Rachel and Rachael) they have both left, walked away.  Its only a matter of time.  I was really proud of myself yesterday because I had been more real with people and for some reason it felt good. But now I am regretting it.  I shouldn’t have because although in the short term it may feel better, I know what will happen. After the initial period where they try and help me and want to be there for me, they get fed up, they aren’t able to cure or solve me, I take up too much time and effort, I’m not who they expected, what the wanted.  They can’t do it so they walk away. That’s what has always happened. That is what will continue to happen. When will I wake up and realise that?   It is impossible to turn me into a beautiful stone – there are no winds strong enough, no waves high enough (and believe me God has tried).   Failed project, mission incomplete, target unobtainable.

      oh forgot to say earlier that I've started reading 'The Inner Voice of Love' by Henri Nouwen - IT'S AMAZING.  From the first 5 sections I think it should be renamed 'The Inner Voice of Karen'.  Also got Messy Spirituality out (as also recommended by the platinumblonde)- its so cool too.  I have decided that maybe I'm not bad - I'm just messy!

      ok sorry have to print correction - well its not really a correction just an explanation of what I meant. When I said 'Melanie apparently wants me to go' (as in to Canada) I didn't mean I am only going because she wants me to - I am desperate to go. But what I meant, was that apparently as well as me wanting to go, she also actually wants me to go. Something I find hard to believe. Sorry for any confusion.  Ok today has gone totally wrong but hey. Went to bed v late last night and so slept through alarm this morning and missed meeting I was supposed to go to.  Then I found out that although I had managed to get Fairtrade orders of £172 yesterday, the 27 Co-op eggs which people had ordered were no longer in stock and they wouldn't be getting any more before Easter. So now I have to go back to church on Sunday without eggs and apologise to everyone and give them their money back.  I feel SO bad about this and although everyone out there will say, "but it's not your fault Karen" I feel like it is a total reflection on me.  I really wanted to encourage people to buy Fairtrade, show them how easy it was, how good it was, and everything has gone wrong.  Was I doing it for the right reasons? I guess I wanted to prove myself and thats why. Now all you lot will again be saying that this is why I need to look to God for my affirmation, not the things I do, or the things people think of me BUT ITS NOT THAT EASY.  Anyway met up with Lizzy this afternoon which was really lovely and ended up chatting for about 2 and a half hours! Told her all about being in hospital and some of the things I struggle with. Wow scary hey - she might find out about the real me!  Am going to see the Passion on saturday - might take a cushion to hide behind when it gets gruesome!

      ok wow what an evening. Prepared to be impressed Melanie!  Let me explain. My church is an Anglican church – church of England – but is pretty laid back and quite charismatic.  And they encourage people that if they feel that God is saying something particular to them, for the benefit of everyone then they should go up and tell one of the leadership people and they can help you decide if its for you or for everyone.  And every now and again someone gets up and says something.  Each month we have a ‘fan the fire’ service which is much more relaxed with a lot more time for prayer and worship and they really encourage people to come up with stuff and I’ve done it got up and said something once before at this service.  But tonight during worship we sang this song about how great God, how he is awesome. And I was struggling to sing it. Not because I didn’t believe it at that moment but because I just felt for lots of people who like I have often, weren’t feeling that at the moment. And then we went on to sing another one ‘Power of your love’ and it has good words about where we want to be, not necessarily where we are, what we want to be like, not necessarily how we are currently. And it has the line ‘and I will soar on eagles wings’ and it suddenly reminded me of Isaiah 40:28-31   “The Lord is the everlasting God, the creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no-one can fathom.  He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall; but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint”     And I just really felt God saying that he understands.  We can’t understand how he understands but he does.  He doesn’t get fed up of us, he won’t give up on us. He will not grow tired or weary with us.  And he knows that at the moment we may not feel like praising him, we may not feel thankful, we may feel tired, weary, burdened and generally crap but there will come a day when we will run, we will not be faint, we will be renewed, we will soar like an eagle, we will be able to look down and see God’s perspective and see that although when we were in it, it didn’t make sense, from this view up above, from God’s view, it does.  And just the encouragement from those verses that it will come one day. We may want it now, we may not understand why it doesn’t happen now, but if we hope in God, if we continue trusting him even though it is SO hard, he will renew us.     And I felt stupid, and the whole why would God possibly speak to me?, wouldn’t he use someone far better, far more important, what can I possibly have to say that is of any benefit to anyone else? but I found myself going up and telling Tamsin who was leading the service. And she said that she thought it was good, it was true and so after the worship she went up and said that someone had come up and said this.  And anyway I was still thinking, what if it was just me, what if I made it all up, what was I doing going up there and thinking I could possibly say something useful, maybe I just wanted to look good.  But then Rob got up to preach and he started off by referring to the passage I had said.  And how Paul (was talking about 2 Tim 4:1-8) knew what it was like to be waiting for something, waiting for God’s promises to be fulfilled, how he had to hope in the Lord and wait to be renewed and how that could give us hope too. So maybe it was right? Or maybe I’m just a freak (far more likely!)  Ok and I have been ‘real’ with 2 people today. Yipee! And neither of them turned around and hit me, or said they hated me (although they could have been thinking it). So experiment is working so far!

      oh its such a beautiful day here today.  Really blustery, but sunny – bit like in Winnie the Pooh! Just got back from church – I was selling Fairtrade Easter eggs after the service – and people actually did buy some!  Was supposed to be going for lunch with a friend. I called her last night to check it was still ok but she was out so I left a message, but she sent me a text at 11 today saying she couldn’t make it (same friend who pulled out of the Cathy Burton thing – is she trying to tell me something?) – so am back home.  Should really do some work but I hate working on Sundays.  I think it is a lovely day just to be, to spend time with people, to do things for yourself.  So I’ve decided to blog instead (oh and do my washing!)    So yesterday…. OK at Easter I am doing this thing called Spring Harvest.  It is three 5 day camps at two Butlin (er...like holiday camps – pretty cheap and nasty but they do!) sites in England.  I went on a week last year and although went sceptical I really enjoyed it. It is about equipping the church for action, and I felt that the teaching was very real and practical and looking outwards. People come from all different denominations and church backgrounds so it is really interesting.  But this year as well as going as a guest, I am doing a week of 5-7 year olds stuff.  They have an amazing kids programme with everyone from birth to 99 years old studying the same passage of the Bible each day.  The theme is Grace and we are looking at the story of Gideon (hence last nights post) in Judges 6-8.  Each day everyone looks at a different passage of that, and all the different age groups just work through it in different ways. I think it is great that they really value the kids and believe that they are just as capable of reading and understanding the Bible.  So anyway yesterday was the training day.  The kids place is called The Paint Factory and we have the Brushes, the Rollers and the Ladders (5,6 and 7 year olds) and then we work in small groups with 2 adults and 16 kids known as ‘pots’!  I am really excited about it. It just seemed really well organised and they had thought about so many things. Like each day we work with the kids from 7:30am-1:30 then we have the afternoon free, but we meet at 5pm for debriefing and time to talk over what happened that day and plan for the next day. In this time we are in small groups, but not with the other person we are leading a pot with. So if we are finding them hard to work with we have somewhere and somebody to talk about it to. So now I just have to read about Gideon and try and make sure I know what it is about!!  I have also applied to help at Soul in the City in the summer.  Ok should explain what that is too maybe? They normally run this thing called Soul Survivor down near where I live.  It’s a Christian camp for young people 14-18. I’ve never been and I’m not sure quite what I think about it, because its good to worship God and have teaching, but don’t think it necessarily encourages people to be active in their faith in actually practically helping people. But this year they are running it in London, with people camping in tent cities all over London parks.  In the morning there will be teaching and worship but every afternoon they will be going out into the local communities to do practical things – like clearing up, decorating community centres, removing grafitti, clearing out rivers, doing repairs and odd jobs.  Really practical things to demonstrate God’s love.  Putting their faith into action. Now this I really agree with. And Tearfund (who I went to Ghana with) are running Fairtrade Cafés at the different tent cities and need people to help. So I thought it would be fun to do and also would be good experience for my fairtrade café.  Oh I have some VERY exciting news – I MIGHT BE GOING TO CANADA!! Yipee!  I have to check the flights again on Monday and just make sure of a few things, but then if I can manage to work for three weeks fulltime I can earn enough money to pay for it and I can go!! Melanie apparently wants me to come (hehe I know you are laughing at this girlie!) and so I may just have to believe her for once, trust her and go for it.   Off for some lunch – and to collect my washing – I do HATE having to go over to a laundry room – oh to have a washing machine again….

      ok sorry guys not blogging much today – but only because it is 11:30pm.  I’ve had a really good day so don’t worry, am feeling far more ‘beautiful stone’ like today.    Just wanted to share something I learnt today, that really spoke to me.  God used Gideon and he was just a farmer who doubted God and said “if the Lord is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our fathers told us about? But now the Lord has abandoned us and put us into the hands of Midian” (Judges 6:13) Hey he thought like me!!  Then when God asked him to go and do this job he said “but Lord how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh and I am the least in my family” (again my thoughts) but God said to him “I will be with you and you will strike down all the Midianites together” He was a nothing, but God used him for amazing purposes.  Maybe there is hope for me yet! (Although God if you are listening to this, I don’t necessarily want you to use me in battle against thousands of Midianites – or their equivalent!)

      Not much happened today. Went to see GP – she was lovely and really encouraging. Did messy creative stuff with the kids.  Played Scrabble with Paul (he is only 4 but pretty good at it now – well kids scrabble anyway). Went out for dinner with friend to Las Iguanas  -is a South American place.  Had Fijitas, which I love. Was good just to catch up and chat.   Sorry not feeling very much like a ‘beautiful stone’ today.

      You've Got Mail is on TV! I've only ever watched it in German so it's quite exciting to watch it in English.  I can actually understand it!  Think flatmates are getting ready for a night out. They don't actually go out often to be fair, but think for some reason they are in for a big session tonight. They are listening to cheesy love songs, drinking and singing loudly - save me!  Feeling rather ill - have just eaten too many chocolate chip cookies! But they were yummy!!

      How come this page looks different on every single computer I use? I get it the way I like it and then when I use a different computer it has all moved and is strange.  So today is Thursday - TV night for some :) but here it is just work and bed.  Hopefully an early night actually.  I haven't watched TV in ages. There doesn't seem to be anything decent on at the moment. For some reason I keep thinking it is Friday.... anyway I was supposed to be going to see Cathy Burton tonight but my friend didn't book the tickets and then changed her mind and didn't want to go anyway and I didn't want to go on my own, so here I am. Maybe I should listen to her music now and I could pretend I was there. Has anyone heard of her? She is really cool. Beautiful voice and really good lyrics.  There is this one song called 'Take me out of here' which I used to play really loudly in my room when life wasn't great!  Saw my CPN today, and as usual she was late.  My appointment was 10:30 but didn't go in until 10:50. So normally at 11:30 she says we have to end but I just kept on talking so she couldn't say anything. Then at 11:45 she said that we had to end and I said rather sarcastically "yes well I suppose I have almost had my hour now haven't I"  She wasn't much help again today. Just told her about the Therapeutic Community (she doesn't know that much about it, she didn't even look round there before referring me!) and then we talked about the Rachel problem.  When I said I was trying to think of all the possible solutions and so far I had only come up with: 1. wait for her to contact me 2. contact her and say it was all my fault, take all the blame 3. contact her and say that I'm not taking all the blame, the CPN helpfully added -"well you could always call her and scream down the phone, or put a brick through her window"  Very useful, sensible and mature suggestions I thought. Who was the professional and who was the patient again????  Looked after the kiddies this afternoon. Hannah is 6, Paul is 4 and Ruth is 2.  Ruth wasn't feeling well - we think she is coming down with chicken pox and so she all she wanted to do is be held.  They are really huggy kids generally, which I love.  It is like the best form of therapy. Can't wait till the baby comes in April and I am going to have tons of 'therapy' with her!!  Right must go and do some work.

      Why do feelings change so quickly? Was feeling fine earlier and now feeling crap (never used to use that word till I met Mel! But it is SO descriptive!) So I thought I'd list the things to see why I was feeling what. Ok -ve things: *missing Rachel *feel so child-like in the way I react to things *feel lonely *have got to see CPN tomorrow *folks at Navs seem so apathetic about somethings - they appear super holy but then don't put it into practice (ok this is me probably being really harsh and I totally understand if you think I am a bad person but I did promise to be honest on this blog) *if I don't contact friends then they don't contact me *don't know what to do about Tanzania  so now I will try and think of all the good things to try and remind myself that things aren't that bad: *my church is going to become a fairtrade church - yipee! *I got an email from Mel which made me feel good *I did lots of work this afternoon *I played the piano with my friend Lizzy  Apparently everyone can think of 5 good things that happened that day to thank God for and its a good exercise to do, because even when things are really rubbish you can often think of 5 things - although I can only think of 4 tonight!  Well night night everyone

      Well I woke up this morning and thought -ahh some time to myself, then realised I should have been at the creche I do at this Talk Together group (some mums of my church get together and do bible study and stuff but they have 10 kids under 3 between them). So phoned them up very apologetically but they were lovely about it.  So did have morning to myself catchin up on writing letters, reading my flatmate's essay, doing a newsletter for Navs tonight.  Then I met up for lunch with 3 girls who I used to do nursing with.  Its really strange because they were the really cool guys who used to sit at the back and basically be 'dead cool'.  I never thought I would have anything to do with them, never knew what to say to them etc (Mel listen to this!)  but then in the second year this girl Danni came up to me one day and asked if we could go for coffee. I was gobsmacked. Turned out she had gone to church when she was at home and believed in God and stuff, but had just totally gone away from it, thought that God was cross with her because she had done tons of not-so-good stuff, slept with some guys etc.  We had a huge chat about it, then I started meeting up with her reasonably regularly and chatting about things and reading the Bible and praying.  It was amazing the change in her. She was stil the same person, part of the cool gang, but she started respecting herself and her decisions, she no longer did things just because everyone else did.  I started sitting with her in lectures and was amazed by how accepting the 'cool group' were of me. I still didn't believe that they liked me but just put up with me because of Danni.  Then they started inviting me out and stuff, I didn't often go, but if I did they would all get really excited.  One time this girl Bronwyn came up to me and said 'you know we all think you are pretty amazing, cos you stick by your beliefs and you don't just merge with the crowd, and yet you don't condemn or look down on us because we don't believe the same or do things you don't agree with.  And you have helped Danni so much, its amazing.  I don't believe in all that christian stuff, but there is something definitely different about you' - I almost passed out!!!  I could not believe my ears (I still don't believe it by the way - well certianly struggle to believe it)  But that has really stuck with me and I can so vividly remember her saying that.    And whilst these girls aren't really good friends and we don't have a lot in common, I know that they actually care and would be there for me if I asked them.  And when I see Danni now, who is going to church, donig sunday school, is even going on a christian camp this Easter, it just makes me smile and feel lovely.  Maybe God can use me even if I'm a bad, useless person!  Am just trying to do some study now (aahh) and then it is Navs tonight. We have a main meeting about International Mission (wish they would do a trip to Canada!)  Oh its been 11 days since I last spoke to Rachel - thats the longest EVER. Struggling not to give in, call her and say it was all my fault.

      Ok so I haven't sung Faure's Requiem before - I've played Faure's Pavane - realised that in the middle of the piece when didn't recognise any of it!! Anyway was still beautiful.  The solo in the third movement was sung by this choir boy who was blind - he was absolutely amazing.  Can you imagine how scary it must be to stand up infront of a huge audience and sing on your own when you can't even SEE them?!!  Was a bit annoyed with my friend though because we were supposed to meet at 5:30 in order to go for coffee beforehand and catch up, but she was late because she got talking to someone else and so didn't arrive until 6:10 and the thing started at 6:15. Anyway.....  Ok this morning I went to visit this Therapeutic Community.  For any of you who don't know what a therapeutic community is go to  urlLink www.therapeuticcommunities.org/faq.htm . But basically it is a place where people with certain mental health probs go for a year to apparently 'get sorted'.  I don't want to go because I feel like although life is quite tough, I AM coping.  But I went to have a look around anyway.  I am SO glad that I asked Debs to come with me, because it was SO scary. We got there and waited in the waiting room and 2 people came in and said can we ask you some questions. Sure no problems.  So they asked me if I had consumed any alcohol that morning, taken any drugs, or had any impending court cases? Well hello nice to meet you too.  After obviously replying no to all 3, we were taken into this huge room where 12 other people were sat in a big circle.  We had to sit down and then everyone went round introducing themselves.  About 3 were staff and 10 residents.  EVERYONE was watching me. I wanted to curl up and hide.  Then we watched this 30min video about what the therapeutic community is and how it works.  during this time another prospective guy came in, so at least there were 2 of us now.  Then we had like a question time.  And although there are lots of things that sound quite good about the place, some stuff is REALLY wierd.  Like if you have a problem at anytime of day or night, you have to approach one of the resident reps who are on duty and they then call a house meeting which all staff and residents have to attend (even in the middle of the night!), to sort it out.  So like I would tell someone if I had a problem!!  Anyway I really don't think I want to go there. But I have asked Debs to think about it and give an objective opinion.  It has been really lovely and warm here today. I even walked out earlier in just a t-shirt. Feels like summer is on its way - yipee!

      I thought no-one loved me but apparently the guestbook isn't working properly. Have had a fiddle with it and it seems to be letting me post there, but not sure if it is working for everyone else!  am at the library in Birmingham at the moment, just on my way to Symphony Hall to listen to Faure's Requiem - I love it. I've sung it a few times and its GORGEOUS.  So anyway I must dash but will fill you in on it later plus my bizarre trip this morning!!  Oh good news - the place where I left my camera and fleece have found them, and someone who works there is coming down to Birmingham on Friday and so I can get them from her. Yipee!  Had strange lecture on mental health and self-esteem today - could have practically given the class myself!  Now have scary homework to do: why is your self esteem the way it is?  If your self esteem is a tree, what are the water and sun that nourish it, and what are the wind, drought, and lumberjacks which cut it down? !!!!!!!

      Ok guys, so if anyone is reading this, this is what I have been up to…. Well over the weekend I went to the Navigators Staff conference. There were like 100 Navs staff and student workers there which was crazy.  I was there to look after the 21 kiddies (why do all Christian families have tons of kids?) We had a 2month, a 9 month, a 12 month, a 18 month, a 21/2, a 31/2 and a 41/2 kid in my room! Was mad, tiring but good fun.  Little Gracie who was 2 months was SO sweet.  I got to hold her and change her nappy -in fact I got to change all the babies’ nappies!  I used to have to do that when I was an auxiliary nurse and then a student nurse on children’s wards, and when you’ve done hundreds with rubber gloves on, doing the odd one or two without gloves is a doddle.    Although the kids were good, was absolutely knackered, had really sore throat and croaky voice, and generally felt pretty rubbish.  Had a bit of a ‘falling apart’ on Saturday night, but made it through the weekend. Guess that’s progress from a few months ago.  Today I set my alarm for 8:30 but slept through it and woke up at 12:30!!  The rushed around madly as was supposed to be going to friend’s for lunch as it was her birthday.  Had a lovely time with her, and was pretty honest and real to (you’ll be pleased to her Mel!) Then this evening was her birthday party, except it was a murder mystery party in panto! (anyone from Canada - do you have pantomime?) So we were all normal people (well not that normal actually – there was Cass Strate, the local vet; Nosomo King; Stu Dumpling, the local butcher – that was me!; Annie Seed, the sweetshop owner…..) then we were in this local production of Aladdin – I was Widdow Twanky. The director had been murdered and we had to work out who it was.  Fortunately I wasn’t the murderer because I am totally hopeless at lying. Was really funny and totally bizarre – my motive for murder was that the director had found out that I had been getting dead cats, dogs, snakes and fish from the local vet and making them into pies!  I HATE dressing up, but it was so ridiculous that it was ok. I went to a charity shop and bought this AWFUL dress; wore stripey tights; a grey curly wig; an old cardigan; and had two balloons down my dress for an enormous bust! (they were even fairtrade balloons actually!) Will NOT be showing you the photos!   So I am off to bed now –since it is 00:37!    Oh am going to start a good quotes thing, so if you have any suggestions email me them.

      I had a good day today, think winning the Survivor contest started it off the right way. Although I could be joint tied with someone else - :( Reading about Survivor on the web is NO where near as good as watching it live.  There is no tension, anticipation, trauma or upset (what kind of addict do I sound like?!! – Mental note for tomorrow: get a life.)    Despite sleeping through my alarm (well to be truthful I woke up, turned it off and went back to sleep again!)  I got to work on time.  The kids were SO excited to see me which was lovely, and with Paul and Hannah in tow we went to pick up Ruth from playgroup.  She apparently had been so excited that morning that I was going to pick her up.  We had some lunch and then went off to the Botanical Gardens to play.  They love going in my car because it only has 2 doors, so they have to  climb  in, which obviously makes it all the more fun!  Came home, built and painted robot models and then played on the computer.  Paul who is 4 is AMAZING on the computer and can do things I can’t!  Tea, bath, stories and bed followed and once they were all tucked up Jo and I sat down to chat.  She is now 39 weeks pregnant and has just about had enough.  She is going for her caesarean on Tuesday – so all prayers (or other random wafflings to God like I do) would be appreciated.  So I decided to treat myself.  I had to go shopping on the way home anyway, so I bought myself some ‘chips’, dip (NOT dill pickle unfortunately), tortilla wraps and my favourite yog-hurts (note pronunciation please). So normally I see food as bad or punishment, but I am trying to use it as a reward this time.  So now I’m in my PJs eating my dip and chips and feeling quite good actually.     Watched Pirates of the Caribbean last night – was good except I fell asleep with only about 20 minutes left to go!!!  I have decided that I am going to try and spend about half an hour every day just for me. So that might be watching a film, or eating something I REALLY like, or reading, or talking to a friend on the phone. But the only condition is that I ALLOW myself to enjoy that time and NOT feel guilty. So we’ll see what happens.  Goodnight folks  mexx

Now quit your whining if you are saying but it was easy this week it was obvious - IT DOESN'T MATTER And I got Tom right for the challenge winner - I am SO good!

      Well am back in lovely Brum.  I listened to Stuart McLean in the car, but Melanie is right I am sure my brain is already programmed to sleep when I hear his voice, because I suddenly started feeling VERY tired.  Not particularly helpful when driving along the motorway at 80mph!   Have decided to move my room all around, well as much as I can in my uni room.  Basically just the things on my bookshelf and desk!  I do like my room here though, it feels like mine. It’s my space.  Had lots of post (which I LOVE – how can people hate getting post??!!) including my next student loan cheque (the bank balance is now looking slightly healthier than previously - phew!) and a letter from my church asking if I would like to attend a meeting about social action and the role my church is and should be taking in the future!  I am really excited about this, because social action is something I feel ENOURMOUSLY passionate about.  And also it would be great to become more involved with the church, rather than just going and doing ‘time’ on a Sunday.   Ok I think I will watch a DVD tonight – still haven’t watched Pirates of the Caribbean yet. Does anyone know can you get ER on DVD/video?? (Not that I’m desperately obsessed or anything – I have a long way to go to reach Debs so it’s all good!)  take care guys love Karenxx  p.s. I now have  smooth  peanut butter! Yippee! p.p.s Beah where do you live? I know Ontario but that’s a pretty big province (between Quebec and Manitoba – are you impressed?!)

      Well I have just watched two solid hours of ER! Definitely the way to start the day! I watched last nights which FORTUNATELY my parents taped as I had asked, which is series 10 and then watched repeat of series 9 this morning.  So I am totally confused about what's happening when after seeing ER in Canada too.  I won't say anything about what happened because Debs might read this and I wouldn't want to spoil the excitement! But I don't think that we are THAT far behind you - about 9 months ER time I am reckoning.  oohh...mustn't forget to get my survivor predictions in....... I've watched the trailer clip for tonights episode but it doesn't really give me any clues. Also the challenge is between the survivor's families so it is harder to predict. So let's recap who we have in: Jenna, Amber, Boston Rob, Rupert, Big Tom, Shi-Ann.  I think its strange how they coincidently have 3 girls and 3 guys...mmmm.....  Right have packed the car, everything is ready, oh I just need to have a shower.  And guess what? suprise, suprise IT'S RAINING!! I thought you said that Vancouver was always wet Melanie!!

      Pears and peanut butter attempt #2.  I have hard pears this time, and my own jar of peanut butter which I can dip the pears into, BUT it is still crunchy peanut butter not smooth and I DEFINITELY think it makes a difference.  I am also slightly perturbed as I thought this was a healthy snack and have just noticed that per 5th of a jar (and our jars are way smaller) as in per 100g there are 614 calories!!!!!!!!!! Don't think about it.  Have just got back from an evening out at my old music teacher/friend's house.  YES I KNOW... I missed ER for that- but I did tape it!  Have also discovered that they are showing repeats of series 9 every morning at 9:55!  Was good seeing my friend, strange but good. I guess I just realise when I see her how much I have changed.  I am so much more independant and assertive with her now. Which is good I guess.  I showed her my canada photos and she thought they were good.  Glad my blog is providing an ideal place for a discussion about Tim Hortons/Timmys/Timmy Ho's or whatever you want to call it.  Haven't used my mug yet today. Tut tut.  Well this is my last night at home. Am back to the big city (Birmingham) tomorrow. I seem to have SO much stuff to take back, it seems to increase everytime I go or come.    So long guys mexx

      Just a quick one to answer some questions. As I am now the resident 'brit' I will do my best to explain some of our funny phrases.  It's all going pear shaped means everything is going wrong, going downhill, all of a mess.  Not sure why this means that though.  Yes this is a pretty common english phrase. But beware - Jamie Oliver uses some very unusual phrases too - like Pucker tucker (menaing good food).  A Precinct - is like an undercover (as in has a roof over the walkways, but not necessarily all one building) shopping centre or mall.  A shopping precinct.    I definitely think we should publish an english-canadian dictionary!!  Blog more later love Karenxx  P.S Melanie DOES sound EXTREMLEY funny when she says "I knnnooooooow!" But it's sweet too.  P.P.S It's lovely to have comments! Thanks guys!

      I just had to blog to say I am eating pears (although they are a bit soft) and peanut butter (but it is crunchy not smooth) Yum yum. Does everyone eat this in Canada - or just Melanie?!! A girl I met in Canada (who happened to also be from Birmingham) is on instant messenger and has just told me she is eating a cinnamon bagel with nutella on-that's SO not fair. Do you reckon it would keep if you sent it in the post??  Have now just been making some wrapping paper (using my new stamps!) for a present I have for a friend who is having her baby on Tuesday.  Very therapeutic.  Well it has been cloudy and pretty dull here today (how British), but am looking out for the glimpses of sunshine in everything else.  Have set my alarm for 10pm on Wednesday, he he I get my next dose before you guys! Must go now and check out the Survivor page it wasn't working this morning. Such dedication.

      ahh....thats better.  I was being stupidly stubborn last night and didn't go to bed till mdinight my time which was over 36 hours since I had woken up last, but anyway my Mum woke me at 8:30 this morning when she went to work, but I went back to sleep and woke up at 10:30.  So am feeling slightly more with it. Plus I am sitting here in my PJs, with a wonderful pipping hot Tim Hortons mug of tea (am afraid its english with milk though but you can't win them all).  Stuart McLean kept me company last night before I drifted off to the land of nod but I now know what Melanie means when she only ever hears the first 10 minutes!  I think all I remember is: "On Sunday Dave and his wife Morley, slept in. On Monday too. Dave had forgotten he had implugged the alarm."  I visited the Vinyl Cafe website but they are only doing tours in Alberta and Suscatchuan (however you spell it). So I emailed them requesting a visit to the UK!  Ouch that was hot! (The tea) So I'm not going to put you through a minute by minute account of my entire trip, but I thought I'd just mention the highlights or some of them at least (in no real order of bestness accept the first one of course!)   1. Scoring 9 out of 10 for ER watching! (Told you I could do it Debs!) 2. Sliced pears and peanut butter 3. Kayacking in Victoria harbour and the Pacific ocean 4. Taking a bike up the coast of Vancouver Island 5. Death by Chocolate 6. Lingirie shopping (I bet nobody has even seen anyone as embarrassed as I was!) 7. Lying in Melanie's living room surrounded by candles listening to Vinyl Cafe 8. Going to the coffee shop to read  9. Spending 2 hours unpacking an ENOURMOUS truck of furniture with 6 random folk who were all lovely 10. Driving Melanie and Nathan's car (it was only like for 1 block whilst M ate her burger!) 11. Hot toasted bagel with cream cheese 12. Painting on Melanie's floor 13. Going to the kid's mall on Granville Island (they even have this kids size door to enter through!) 14. Learning how to smack someone's arse! 15. Having amazingly in depth discussions with Melanie about things I would NEVER dream of talking about outloud 16. Having a picnic in Stanley Park with a picnic HAMPER (he he!) 17. Watching the Mission ( I HATE injustice, what they did was SO unfair) 18. Playing at the park (where some totally irresponsible person went on the baby swings and broke it! Can you believe it! I mean who would do a thing like that?!) 19. Going to a session at Parliament - they bickered like kids at kindergarten 20. Watching Survivor (it was SO traumatic!) 21. Meeting tons of amazing and wonderfully friendly people 22. Tim Hortons 23. Kraft Dinner (which did strange things to my digestive system!) 24. dill pickle dip and chips (there are rather a lot of references to food here! I promise I did more than just eat!) 25. Second hand bookshops 26. Climbing trees - or more hilarious was usually attempting to get back down again 27. Seeing spandex boy in the flesh - or should I say in the spandex! 28. My asking some poor British girl who I had only met 10 minutes previously, where she bought her underwear! I thought Canadians, and especially Melanie, weren't stun-able - I was WRONG!! 29. I KNOW! (I love you Melanie) 30. Learning it's ok to let yourself love someone and be loved in return 31. Dsicovering the art of a good hissy fit! 32. learning THERE IS ENOUGH GRACE.... EVEN FOR ME!  I could go on but I won't. So that was Canada. Am seriously considering emigrating there now....I wonder if Death by Chocolate would employ me??? Mind you the coach driver to Victoria did offer me a job as a tour guide as I seemed to know more about Vancouver and Victoria than he did!    So the time has come for me to get and get clean. But my parents shower has broken whilst I was away so we have to use the pathetic one in the other bathroom which I could spit faster than, and which after being in Canada, where the shower burns a whole in your back if you stay in any one position for too long, I would probably be better off going outside and using the hosepipe!  mex

      Why?Why?Why?Why?Why?Why?Why?Why?Why?Why?Why?  Why do I make a mess of everything?  Was just trying to tell my parents about what I did in Canada, and I tried to be honest with them, and tell them how I was feeling and said that I found it hard leaving there and my Mum goes "well you know you didn't have to come back here if you didn't want to you know", I was like what do you mean by that? She said, "well if everything was so perfect in Canada, why did you come home? I mean if we are such bad parents, and if we do everything wrong, and if nothing is good enough here." I said where did you get that idea from, I was just saying that I had a good time.  My dad then said "well you don't have to go on about it, you always say how good everywhere else is, I mean what more do you want from us?"  Is it wrong that I had a good time?  Maybe I shouldn't have said anything to them. I just don't understand what I did wrong.  I feel real lonely.

      Well I'm back on this side of the pond. Don't want to be. Was sat next to this lovely Swiss guy on the plane who had just spent 4 months in Vancouver with a friend of his and was really upset about leaving too, so we consolled each other!  Is that grace Melanie? Watched 2 good films but one (Big Fish) made me cry and then I started sobbing uncontrollably, fortunately everyone was asleep and so I stuck my head into the pillow and just let it all out.  I didn't sleep at all on the flight so now to my body it is 11:20 am on Monday and I haven't slept since Saturday night.  Am feeling not too tired actually but rather sick. I think it is the Poutin still!  Well I'm not going to blog anymore tonight, but I promise I'll fill in anyone who is reading and wants to know, tomorrow.   Sleep well guys. Enjoy the sunshine for those of you in Vancouver (my parents can't believe I have come back from Canada with a suntan! Mind you they wouldn't understand any of what really happened in Canada and how amazing it was, but hey.)   mex

      i've just been ocean kayacking!!!!!! It was SO cool. We only saw 2 sea lions but the scenery was stunning - we could see really clearly the Olympics mountains in Washington, USA.  we were kayacking alongside the seaplanes! A very strange site.  Met some cool guys - 2 christians from Toronto!  There were only 6 of us in the group so it was great. Plus we got it half price because we are staying at the hostel.  This morning I went to the RBC musuem and also to a session at Parliament! But will blog later about that.  Everyone here is SO friendly.  take care guys

      I saw sheep today! And a Wal-Mart!!  Vancouver Island is really gorgeous and sunny! Victoria is really small and more like a town than the capital city of BC.  Tomorrow I am off to the British Columbia Musuem and then I might go kayaking.  The hostel where I'm staying is organising a mega cheap trip, so if you never hear from me again I will be flailing around somewhere in the Pacific ocean!  mexx

      Hey guys…..this blog comes to you from the beautiful state of British Columbia (well that’s what the number plates say anyway)….  Quick resume of my trip so far….Arrived here on Thursday evening didn’t sleep at all on the plane, then stayed up till late when I got here, but wasn’t that tired at all.  The flight was good, amazing views of Greenland.  Was sat next to this really old guy (he was 87 I think) who started speaking German to me. Now fortunately I can speak German and so understood him, but he didn’t know that!  Anyway he talked to me through out the entire trip all about what he thought about George Bush, the state of healthcare in Germany….. If I asked him to move so I could go to the toilet it was a 10 minute affair so I took to leaping over the back of the seats instead!    Thursday night is TV night in the Wallace household.  I was well prepared for this and had psyched myself up for a 2 hour period of silence through out Survivor and ER.  Survivor was traumatic and I hate to admit it but actually found myself getting quite involved!  We then hung around waiting for ER to start and can you believe it….THERE WAS NO ER!  I couldn’t believe it.  After all that I didn’t get chance to prove my adherence to the ER rules.    Friday I woke up at 6am for some crazy reason.  Melanie had an appointment in the afternoon so I took a look around the UBC campus.  Amazing views of the mountains and the sea…oops sorry I mean ocean.  I then decided to go down to this beach, which I was blissfully wandering along when I stumbled over a naked woman!  I discovered later that it was a nudist beach!!  Ok these Canadians are weird (not that we don’t have nudist beaches but we wouldn’t be laying their naked in April!)  Saturday Melanie and I went up to the Capilano Suspension Bridge.  As my ‘I made it’ certificate states I braved heights of 230 feet and a 450 foot span across the raging waters of Capilano Canyon.  Then we had a picnic on the beach in Stanley Park.  It was a really lovely day.  Sunday we went to church and then chilled, painted and listened to lots of crazy music.  Monday (that’s today right? I am totally confused) we read Vinyl Café stories – I am a TOTAL convert.  I love them.  Melanie reads them real good too.  This afternoon I went downtown on the bus and back again armed with Melanie’s map (without getting lost)  I wandered around Canada Place (which is this really weird building built like a sailing boat – but does have very nice loos!)  and then went to the central library to get a Vinyl Café CD – told you totally hooked.  The library is like massive and really nice inside, definitely not like England.  And everyone is so helpful and pleasant.  It’s now raining here and so I’m feeling like I’m back in England.  There are so many things which are similar but then some really different things I wouldn’t have thought of especially phrases and expressions.  Melanie and I should bring out a Canadian/English dictionary.  I keep saying store, bathroom, couch, cell phones WHAT’S HAPPENING TO ME?????  Melanie and I have decided that we should set up a second hand bookstore/coffee shop.  Melanie will do the books and I’ll serve lots of Fairtrade tea and coffee, homemade soup, and any other culinary delights I or the domestic goddess can think of.  We are going to have Vinyl Café playing and invite Stuart McLean to come and do a live reading!  Any other suggestions welcome.  Promise we won’t be in competition with your Deep Sea Chicken business Matthew.  Ok well that’s all folks…. Am off to Vancouver Island tomorrow. Take care guys.  Mexx

      sorry guys never came back and wrote part 2. Am leaving for the airport in 40 mins so better keep this short and sweet.  Platinumblonde will probably blog whilst I'm there - so you can go and check out her page and find out how fed up she is with me!!  Although she can't write anything too horrific because I can read it later (unless she deletes it then....) Anyway I'm not allowed to think/say such things or else James will deduct points from me.  Am really excited now, but can't quite believe that I'm going to be in Canada later today. REALLY hope I don't puke on the plane because I have a window seat and don't want to have to climb over everyone. am also a bit nervous...what if I get there a discover Melanie is a total wierdo?!!  And don't worry you ER fans because I have my gagged packed.  so anyway I better dash. Cheerio...tuddle pip.....be good love Karenxx    P.S I have a confession....I have an insiders guide to ER on my bookshelf! But it was from when I was like 16.

      I’M BACK!  I know it has only been just over 1 week since I last blogged but I have SO much to tell you all!! So Part 1…..  Ok first week at Spring Harvest I was in the Paint Factory doing 5-7s.  The whole theme for Spring Harvest this year is Grace and we were looking at Judges 6-8 and how God shows his grace by constantly helping the Israelites to get out of sticky situations, and this time specifically with Gideon.  We had to start work at 7:30 each day when we would spend some time as a whole group reading Judges and praying and stuff. Then we would set up our venue and the activities we were going to do with the kids and pray together with our co-leader (The 360 kids were split up into ‘pots’ of 16 kids with 2 leaders).  Then at 9 we went to Good Morning Big Top, which is half an hour of all age worship and a fun enactment of that days passage in Judges. Then it was a quick run back over to the paint factory to welcome and greet the kids.  The morning was spent in our small pots and also up on the Factory Floor learning about Gideon and singing etc.  The kids would then be collected at 1.  Each day Bertie the paint machine would mix a colour and that would help us with our clue which would teach us something about God.  So on day 1 it was a blue mirror which was to remind us that God can use anyone – when you look in the mirror God can use that person. Day 2 was a red smiley face which reminded us that God keeps his promises, day 3 was a purple strong arm – God is powerful, day 4 was a yellow hand – God helps us and day 5 was a green crown – God wants to be our King.   I was co-leading with this amazing lady called Ruth who had been doing kids at Spring Harvest for about 7 years.  She and her husband, who was also on team, are foster parents and over the last 14 years had fostered over 200 kids!  She was SO lovely and encouraging.  Often I end up being put with someone who either is really apathetic or who is just really difficult.  But Ruth was really keen to do stuff and was also happy to use my ideas and stuff, and kept saying how good I was with the kids.    Anyway through out the week the leadership team who were running the Paint Factory were really friendly, encouraging and accepting.  They kept saying lovely things to me, but of course I didn’t listen or didn’t believe them.  I was struggling as usual to believe that God loves me let alone wants to use me, that I wasn’t anywhere near as good as everyone else, that I couldn’t possibly be doing anything beneficial.  But I really did feel I had learnt so much during the week that through looking at such fundamental truths in a way that was accessible for kids, I had really started to believe some of them.  So often us as adults complicate things and put prerequisites and added extras on God’s promises and words, and yet that isn’t what it he wants. The kids really challenged me (if God is loving how come he sent the Midianites to attack Israel? How can I make a super fighter bomber plane out of straws?) But they also encouraged me and gently helped me forward.  When a child of 6 who doesn’t know all the historical and scientific evidence for Jesus and who isn’t aware of all the promises God makes to us in the Bible, is able to say that they believe and will trust in God and are wiling to be honest with him and ask him for help; it demonstrates so clearly to me what a gentle, accepting and understanding God we have who meets us right where we are. Gideon was a nobody, he wasn’t an exceptional person, he made mistakes, and he questioned and doubted God, yet God still loved him and used him.  Maybe there is hope for me yet! Also learnt a new skill of filming!  I offered to go out a couple of afternoons and film Leanne and Julie – who were the factory workers, playing on different things around site – to show the kids what they had been up to.  We also made a video for people volunteering next year to show at the briefing day to show them what Spring Harvest is like.  See undiscovered talents!  I decided to write a short letter to the leadership team thanking them for everything – which ended up as a 3 pager!  The next day people from the team came up and thanked me for my letter and said how much is meant to them.  Julie who was co-leading the programme came and told me how she has the same doubts about ever being good enough and what she is doing here.  She also asked me if I would like to help on a summer programme she is doing.  Then Alan who leads the programme came and gave me this huge hug and said how amazed and impressed they had all been with me.  How I was always the first to offer if help was needed, how I was always smiling, how I was so enthusiastic, how good I was with the kids, how much effort I put in, how honest I was.  And that they really saw potential in me and he knew that God would use me hugely in the future.  He then said that he would really like me to help again next year and would I be interested in maybe in the future getting more involved in the leadership?!!!! I almost passed out!  He said that they looked at people’s character not how good or perfect they were, and that I had the right character for this type of work!!  I was so astounded.  Ruth and I had a chat later that day, and I told her about my feelings of worthlessness etc and she said that she could tell I was a really special person and she was going to keep reminding me of that.  She gave me this little card with ‘God loves me because I’m so special’.    Ok part 2 to follow later! Can't believe it: i'm leaving in less than 48 hours!!  love Karen p.s. i'm not impressed with the certain lack of homework carried out by you guys during my absence!   p.p.s i have got so much blog-reading to do I don't know if I'll get to bed tonight!

      ok one more thing... sometimes I absolutely hate life (quite a lot acutally although it is decreasing) but every now and again I get this amazing sense of wow- isn't this world so beautiful and special.  Like sat here this evening I was watching a gorgeous sunset and just though how lucky I was to be alive. And it really makes me appreciate life and want to explore and have more adventures in life.  there is SO much yet to do!  SO...  whilst I'm away I am setting some homework! In no more than 30 words tell me what's so great about our world, Earth and why you wouldn't want to move to the Moon (apparently no-one has actually ever landed on the moon, it was all a con - not sure about that one), Mars or some other planet like the one Mel comes from [Oohh I'm being cheaky now!  I LOVE you really :)]  Can't wait for your wierd and wacky answers!  Unfortunately I can't promise a trip to the caribbean for the winner, but you never know what might just be landing on your doormat if you do win!!

      okay I'm gonna be a tell-tale - Melanie told me to write that last blog!  And now I'm REALLY scared that Marsha isn't going to let Katelyn read my blog anymore because of what that word means to you Canadians - sorry Marsha! Let me just say that scanky is a totally safe word here and just means rubbish, old, yucky.  so when I said scanky computers I wasn't meaning anything dodgy!!  Let me explain the points system: basically James and Lizzy and I are doing this thing, whereby we get a point if we say or do something positive towards ourselves, if we admit that we are ok people, if we believe that someone likes us. But if we think/say we are rubbish and put ourselves down, or deny that anyone could possibly ever like us then we lose a point. The winner is obiviously the one at the end of the term with the most points.  I can't believe it but Katelyn, despite living with the apparent queen of ER, doesn't know what the ER rules are. so for the benefit of her and any other fortunate others who haven't been subjected to them here they are: 1. No talking except in the adverts (although Melanie has slackened a bit and said you can say one-liners) 2. No questions except in the adverts 3. No criticisms of the medical aspects of the programme at ANY time and then there are optionally extras like sitting in the total dark.  I can sort of understand the first two, but no criticisms - the programme just asks for it really.  i mean don't get me wrong I like the show but what sort of programme puts 2 med students in a NICU?!! Ok I'll shut up now Debs. So I think I'll have to take a gag with me to Canada in order that I'm not deported!   well this is it folks, my last blog for a while (yipee I hear them cry) I was just reading through Platinumblonde's old blogs and she is just SO eloquent and witty in her blogs. She makes really mundane, everyday, boring things sound funny and exciting. she obviously just has the gift of the gab! [in the nicest possible sense!]  So think of me spending the next week at Butlins with 300 5-7yr olds!  I'm actually REALLY looking forward to it. Have everything ready - including my paint-splodged dungarees (canadian translation: overalls), my wellies (what do you call them?), my supply of food, a clothes horse to make into a cool doorway into our den, some old sheets and pegs to make the den, and tons of other stuff too.    Off now to pack the car and do my ironing.  Ok guys take care of yourselves.

      Good evening!  Yipee I'm at home which means I can blog online without it costing me a fortune or having to use the scanky uni computers. Well it's my usual time of writing - almost midnight.  Drove home this evening and only got back at 9.  By the time I had unpacked the car, put my washing on, and said hello to my parents it was already 11pm so I thought since I was still up you could have the pleasure of my company!  Today has been ok.  Had some crap - but am learning to see things more balanced and not discount the positives (like Ruthie saying she loved me- and when that comes from a 2 year old it means SO much - although it could be just because I had made her a bead bracelet!)  so the crap: Well Jon (Rachel's fiancee) phoned me about Spring Harvest next week when I am there as a guest with them and his youth group.  And said "you don't mind do you " that I was going to be put in a chalet with 3 other 17 yr old girls who I totally don't know to look after them and make sure they don't get up to anything they shouldn't.  Well firstly when someone says 'you don't mind do you?' it hardly gives you much space to say anything really - I mean I am not that brave yet to say well actually I do.  And he didn't ask me, or say this is what I'm thinking about, what do you reckon.  It was just this is what I've arranged, thats ok isn't it.  But the problem was I was in the middle of packing the car, and when people spring things on me I can't think fast enough. So of course my usual automatic pilot came on and I said no of course thats fine.  But came off the phone fuming.  I mean its not a totally unreasonable request, except it wasn't a request as such, but it just annoyed me that what I wanted didn't seemed to matter or even be an issue.  I was cross for four reasons mainly: 1. He didn't ask me to be a leader and have responsbility when I signed up. I agreed to going on the basis of I was just going with him and Rachel and it would be time to chill and relax and not be responsible for people after my week with the kiddies. And that he would be responsible for his youth group not me 2. This is my week, which I've paid for, to do the things I want, not to be with some random strangers (is that really selfish?) 3. I don't know these girls at all, and they all know each other, I want to be with someone I know. I haven't seen rachel for over 2 months and probably won't see her for another 2 months. Plus we have some stuff to sort out. 4. I am going to be knackered after my week of kiddies and don't want to share a room with a 17yr old who is probably going to come rolling in at 2am  So anyway I talked to my friend julie about it and said am I being really selfish and unreasonable and she said no, that this was my need and my wants and thats ok to have them.  so I phoned up Jon to explain (normally I would avoid it and email but I didn't today!) unfortunately - or maybe fortunately - I got his answer phone so I left this really long message explaining the above.  I then called rachel to make sure that it wasn't that she didn't want to share, because if she didn't then ok I would have no choice. But she said it wasn't that, it was just that they wanted to have leaders in each chalet to like watch out and chat to the younger people if they had any problems (although I'm not sure if I believe her because she kept going on about how she thought it best if we weren't together).  Now I have NO problem doing this - if this is what I've signed up to do, but I was never asked to do this before.  then she said oh but you only have to sleep there, and I felt myself starting to give way and just say oh ok in order to please and not upset people, but I held firm and kept reiterating that I wasn't asked to do this and I really would like it if I was in the same chalet as her, so long as she was happy with that.  I explained that this was my desire, that this was what I would like, and whilst I understood that you obviously can't always have everything your own way, I really felt that it was important for me to express my wishes.  I explained that I needed to respect myself and my own boundaries and was doing this by saying that I wasn't happy sharing with these other girls. So I held my ground. Felt really horrible about it at first, but was ok. Just hope I'm not being totally unreasonable and selfish. I keep thinking, no I just stood up for my needs and was assertive, but then keep having periods of 'oh my goodness what a bad person I am, how could I possibly be so selfish and demanding'. And I suspect that some of you will read this and think oh my what an awful person but hey I promised I would be open and honest on here.  Jon didn't call me back but he just came online and said that he had picked up my message and understood it and was trying to sort it out.  So yipee I did it!   James does that count as a point? I reckon I should get 10 for that. Oh hang on I haven't explained the points system - will do that tomorrow.  Oh am feeling slightly peckish (apparently you canadians don't use that word, or salopetes, or dungarees - you wierdos!). Maybe a glass of milk and a fairtrade cookie is in order.  I'll blog tomorrow - Katelyn don't kill me - but I won't be blogging for the next 2 weeks because I'll be at Spring Harvest - but promise I'll do an extra huge blog when I get back on the 15th if you want me to. Please think of me with my 300 5-7yr olds - it could be total chaos!

      Okay, okay I’m blogging.  Thought no-one was reading it anyway, but thanks to you loyal blog fans (Katelyn!)  Am not going to write much now even though I promised (I’m sorry) because it is midnight and I’ve just got in and I HAVE to have a reasonably early night (ok so this isn’t early, but compared to my 2ams recently it is early).  But I’ve just has a WONDERFUL evening with Debs (and I’m not just saying that Deborah) It was so cool just to hang out with someone, to just be normal – well as normal as you can get with me and Debs in one place.  We cooked risotto (well I stirred the risotto) and then we ate – funnily enough – then we had vienetta (yum yum) and then stripped wallpaper – which was SO good.  Strange as it seems I actually love that sort of thing – it is so rewarding and such a sense of achievement like when it’s all done.  We didn’t totally complete it but I finished my wall so I was chuffed.  Then the crème de la crème…..we watched ER!!!!!!  I was introduced to the rules of ER watching, and practically had to shove my hand in my mouth to stop myself from breaking them.  It was a great episode because it was set in the NICU (Neonatal intensive care unit for you non-medics) which I love and it had lots of babies in it (duh, obviously). But it was totally unrealistic because the babies were too big, you wouldn’t treat the parents like they did, they really don’t use quite that much jargon, medical students wouldn’t even be in NICU….Sorry Debs you didn’t say I couldn’t complain about the medical side on my blog – you just said not during the programme!    Also had a cool day because I went to help look after the kiddies at the Talk Together group and we had less kids today, but had the 4 gorgeous babies, who all needed lots of cuddles obviously.  This week was the last one until after Easter, and they had brought this gorgeous bunch of flowers for me and the other lady who helps.  They were so lovely.  Made me feel really valued and appreciated.  Oh funny incident today. Went shopping to Aldi (just like this cheap German supermarket we have over here) and they had 3 in 1 lycra cycling outfits!!!  Was so tempted to get one for Spandex boy!!!  Would you like me to bring one out?! He he.  Ok goodnight folk, have a good rest of your Wednesday.  Two weeks tomorrow......

      Hehe, my brother has just got back from the football match - playoffs for promotion into the premier league - and his team won - so he has returned rather hoarse from screaming and shouting so much.  He also has like tribal war paint on his face!  It reminds me of playing indians in the garden as kids.   Oh and today I discovered this place in cheltenham that does pottery painting parties - like the one Melanie had - how cool.

      Ok so I am back.  I've decided that the grocery situation is SO dire that I simply have to blog in order to prevent others falling into a comotose state.  I am at my brothers at the moment.  His fiancee and I went to this huge craft store - almost rivalled the candian ones - but not quite! to choose card and stuff for making wedding invitations.  I also got some bits and bobs. Tried to get a puncher but they didn't have any stars or shapes I wanted.  I did get some embroidary thread for another project I am working on but it is TOP-SECRET so can't tell you anything about it yet.  Well this week has been a bit of a blurr.  Had 2 assignments to hand in which I managed, my last lectures for the term, my job interview/briefing thing, a chuch social action meeting and of course last night was the last ever episode of Friends.  Lizzy came round, and my flatmates and some others all piled in Lisa's room to watch it but actually I wasn't THAT impressed - thought it was a bit predictable.  And like you wouldn't know you were having twins!    Job went really well. Start next week doing about 25 hours a week. I can work anytime between 8am and 8pm.  I think the work will be interesting - get to read about some well wacky patients - makes me and others seem quite normal. But it is going to seriously challenge my lack of introversion as I will be working in this little cupboard with no windows and just me on my own! AAAhhhhhhh. As you can probably tell unlike Melanie I do not have an innate desire to be a  hermit. Infact I HATE my own company.  Think I will take a radio or something - hey maybe I could listen to Vinyl Cafe all day. And they even said that if everything goes ok over the summer they would like to offer me the opportunity to carry on in September just doing 10 hours a week or however many I want AND they will increase my pay! This is like my first proper job.  All my other jobs have been looking after kids and stuff which doesn't really feel like a proper job. I have to wear smart clothes too!  the social action meeting was really encouraging. I was totally intimidated because I was the only young person - the other couple who were vaguley young were late 20s, they had all been at church for years, and were all super-holy folk.  But it went well and I felt able to say stuff, and it was so inspiring to hear other people fighting against injustices and having a heart for this sort of thing = made me feel like I'm not a complete nutter or totally alone banging away at the Great Wall of China with a plastic toy hammer.  Well thats if for now folks.  hope you are all doing ok. xx

      sorry for lack of blogging. Still here.   Interesting night at Navs tonight - all about issue of homosexuality.  Think the hm-hm word was mentioned more in one night than over the entire history of Birmingham Navs!    Will blog more another time I promise, but who needs me when you have this highly interesting conversation about cash and carry emerging in the guestbook!

      Hello blog readers. Well after a weekend without blogging, I thought it would be best to return lest I get a harassing email from Katelyn!  I am very excited….I bought a kite today…for 43p – that’s like 68cents.  What a bargain. Have yet to see how far my 43p gets me when it comes to flying it!!  Was thinking about making kites with the kids but not quite sure how to – is it just a diamond shape with a cross of poles? They make it look easy in Mary Poppins.  Any suggestions?  Also Katelyn: where do you get fabric pens from?   On Saturday we (my flatmates and I) had a BBQ – it was great fun especially because I got to be in charge of the BBQ – which I was NEVER allowed as a kid – I think I’m a bit of a pyromaniac actually.  And we had – what I’ve learnt you call – s’mores. Yummy.  Rupal and I watched ‘The Last Samurai’ it was so good, but so sad.  I’m excited because Rupal is probably staying in Birmingham next year (she is my flatmate who is Indian but from Kenya – the one I went to the Temple with).  I’m really pleased because I get on well with her, we have such a laugh and are always winding each other up.  Once her exams have finished and I’ve handed in my assignments we are going to do some day trips to Stratford-Upon-Avon (Shakespeare’s place), Warwick castle, Cadburys World (apart from Melanie and Ron, did you guys realise that where they make all the Cadburys Chocolate is here in Birmingham? Its just down the road from the university) and other things.     I have a job interview tomorrow. Don’t want the job, but thought the practice would be good as I haven’t had that many interviews. So ought to head for bed.  Good night guys

      Ok some explainations: 1. Pick & mix - sweets, you choose different sweets and put them in a bag and then they charge you depending on the weight. 2. Navs - Navigators - see guestbook on the Arbarbablog or check out http://navigators.co.uk 3. No you don't get smitted/smoted or anything else if you miss Navs bible study. In fact I found out that 2 other girls bunked off too and went for a walk and chat.  Think we probably talked more about God and stuff anyway. 4. I'm studying Health Promotion - and no that doesn't mean just telling people to eat healthily and exercise.  There are two main areas we study - individual approach: behaviour change, education, lots of psycholoy stuff and then community based work: community health development, policy change, advocay, empowerment etc. which is what I want to do. 5. On the night of the 26th July 1996 I was probably at home in bed.  Had good day yesterday. Managed to work on assignments from 10am till 3pm  with only a half hour break.  Then went and looked after kiddies, then went and had pizza and went bowling with some friends.  I used to be not too bad at bowling but haven't played in about 4 years so I was working on the whole 'first shall be last and the last shall be first' philosophy, but it didn't work! I actually came 4th out of 6 (and i was the 2nd girl) so not too bad.   Have just met up with my tutor and had a really fasciniating discussion of self-esteem and self-worth and what creates it, maintains it and destroys it.  Also how we have medicalised it, given it a title and tried to measure and quantify it.  We have turned it into some formula, like if you have 5 points on this scale and 10 on the other then you will turn out with high self esteem. It's all interesting stuff. I've really learned a lot about myself during this module.  I think we should support Marsha and all campaing against magazines like that in public libraries. I'm good at writing letters - do you want me to write one Marsha?!!

      I AM BLOGGING!!!!!!  But no-one is around to read them, no-one else was blogging (until you did yesterday Katelyn) and no-one was writing anything in the guestbooks!!!!!!!!! (you cannnot out-punctuate me Jonathon!) Am starting to get seriously concerned about platinumblonde though - anyone heard from her at all lately????  So it's another beautiful day. Why does sunshine make you feel SO much better? Had lectures and other stuff yesterday, but got lots of work done.  It's strange how I was so UNproductive on Monday when I had the entire day free to work, but yesterday the words just flowed.    Today at chreche we took all the kiddies outside all morning, which was lovely, but am now worn out after running races, chase games, trampolening and baby holding!  Some of the kiddies were poorly today and so rather grizzly, which makes it harder - but it was fun.    Today is Navs day - AAAAaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I totally forgot to set the video for ER! OH MY GOODNESS!  Oh but actually it is the episode I saw in Canada - ok crisis over.  Oh I am extremly pleased that Jonathon has seen the light and started reading Stuart McLean - well done you.  I have listened to THE FLY every night this week and still haven't made it passed the first 5 minutes!

      Where is everyone? Am feeling loney and deserted!!  I can't believe that nothing vaguely interesting has happened today....except for finding a 2p piece from the 'mother land' in the Arbarbanel's plughole!  I have just got back from going to the Hindu temple with my flatmate Rupal. Was interesting, strange, bizarre, cool, different.  Will blog more about it later maybe.  Haven't been successful with work today - oh dear!  I ought to get super-efficient, speed-demon platinumblonde on the case.....anyone else want to write something about a community health development project in the slums of Delhi? IT's SO interesting and what I'm really passionate about - I just hate having to fit it into these criteria and framework that some academic has created.  It makes it so theoretical and sucks the life out of the work that is being done.  Also a main part of the project is that it is run using a Christian philosophy and because of their demonstration of God's love for mankind.....can't exactly write about that in my essay.  take care guys

      Ok so I am supposed to be writing my assignment but I was just sat on the loo and had a bit of a revelation! This morning I was reading a little book by Max Lucado – called ‘He did this just for you’ that I read ages and ages ago – I think it is an extract from the one you bought Melanie.  Anyway it’s talking about God’s love for us is like a parent’s love for their child. And then when I was on the loo I suddenly got it.  I suddenly realised that maybe it is possible for God and other people to love me without me having to earn it.  I mean the kids I look after – I love them right – but what do they offer me? What do they do for me?  They don’t DO anything, I just love them for who they are. I love spending time with them, looking out for them, getting to know them.  And like the new baby – I think she is gorgeous, I feel love for her even though she has no personality as such yet, she offers me nothing and is utterly helpless. What is there to love?  I don’t know why I just do. So maybe this is the same for other people and me. Maybe they just love me for no reason, not because I have earned it or done anything particular to deserve it.  And the Bible says if we humans can have such love, how much more does God love us? Wow amazing thought.

      well I have to tell you about my funny incident today.  My flatmates thought it was hysterical.  I was drinking out of my water bottle with one of those pullcaps on the top, you know which you pull up to drink (not sure what the technical word is and is incredibly hard to explain actually!)  Anyway, I finished drinking and was pushing it back down with my tongue as I always do, and my tongue got STUCK!  So here am I with my tongue stuck in the top of the drinking bottle and I couldn't get it out because it was in my mouth.  So I hop about and run into the kitchen making garbled noises to my flatmates, who just fall about laughing.  Eventually manage to pull it off, causing my tongue to bleed profusly.  So I spent the next 30 minutes sucking on an ice cube trying to stop the bleeding.  My tongue feels very funny now, but at least I managed to brighten up my flatmates day!  Spent a lovely afternoon in the coffee shop - it is hot here today so I had a chocolate frappucino rather than a hot choc - yummy!  Off to church now. Armed with paper and crayons.....

      Well I haven't blogged since Thursday and there is generally very poor bloggage all round, so I will try and make amends.  Well I've almost finished assignment #1 - i've written the 3000 words but haven't quite finished what I want to say! I am going to see my tutor about it on Tuesday. Have started assignment #2, so it's all going to plan at the moment.  Feel like summer is on its way. We've had 2 good days now and on Friday I even let the kids have the water tray outside! The kids took off all of their clothes and paddled in the 3 inches of water!  Paul and I had a deep discussion about how we mustn't waste water because of the many people in the World who don't have water.  He got very frustrated when I said we lived in England though - insisting that we didn't live in England, we lived in Birmingham!!  Have just been to a concert Lizzy was singing in - it was really good.  I especially enjoyed Carmina Burana (?spelling?) it is so passionate and emotive.  I took my journal and sat drawing and writing throughout - the lady next to me didn't look too impressed but who cares!  I can think really clearly and rationally when listening to music like that.  I've decided that tomorrow I'm going to go into town and go to the coffee shop - was going to go today but was rather sweaty this morning after playing basketball (even worse (sorry Melanie going to gross you out again - it wasn't my sweat - but James'!! I fell on him and got covered in it! urgh yuck!) I'm going to take my book and spend Sunday afternoon there - what a great way to spend a Sunday! Shame I can't take my card making stuff with me too. How cool would that be? A coffeeshop/second hand bookshop/card making place all in 1!! (Apparently I am always using double punctuation according to Katelyn - sorry!!)  It's the Eurovision Song Contest here tonight - have you heard of it in Canada? Did you know that Celine Dion won the Eurovision Song Contest once - for Switzerland!!!  Not quite sure how she managed that (both to win and to represent Switzerland) Don't know who has won this year though. The UK used to do well, but as with most things, we don't anymore.  Ok, well I think I've redeemed myself with bloggage - your turn guys......

      Aahhh that’s better. Am back in my room, listening to Great Big Sea, with a glass of lemon ice tea, and chopped up pear and kiwi with natural yoghurt – yum! Have had another hectic day – finished off by collecting donations for Christian Aid (Its Christian Aid week and I volunteered for a street, where I dropped off envelopes at the start of the week and was returning to collect the money tonight) Is also quite challenging doing such things – good practice for facing criticism and avoiding feeling rejected!  Saw my CPN today – annoyingly useless as usual (maybe I should get her a stick of dynamite…..), and after telling her how much I learnt over Easter – at Spring Harvest and in Canada, and how well things were going she simply said ‘so things not too bad then’ – what encouragement and positive reinforcement!!! But didn’t let her get to me.    Its 9:30 and I’m going to watch ER from last night and be in bed by 11pm. I PROMISE. (I’ll let you know how well it goes tomorrow!) Tomorrow is also another WORK day – as long as my brain decides to co-operate – and so NO fiddling with blog is allowed – if you see any changes I give you permission to seriously reprimand me!   Goodnight folks.

      Morning! Ok so I think I've set this up onw - click the 'my photos' link on the left and it should take you to the page where they are.  Only have a few on their as it takes ages to upload them and can't do it on the uni computers as you have to download this package to let you do it, and you can't download stuff on the uni computers.  Have added them on the main template - but actually I might not be able to fit that many on that way, may be better to add them as posts like the one below. hmmmm.....

      Ok so now I'm in my room and using my computer the page doesn't look  quite  as nice as on the uni computers, and I generally access it more in my room so that matters more. At uni all the words on the side bar were in blue. AND this new design makes the pages ages slower to load AND sometimes it doesn't load with the links and stuff one the sidebar hummmm.....  Wore my Canadian t-shirt to Navs tonight - you guys would be proud! Talked far too much in my group though, as we were mixed up again and had a new person, I was quite anxious (and then I get really talkative to try and hide the fact I'm feeling anxious) and also I had a glass of coke and so that made me quite hyperactive. I find it really hard when its a different group, especially with lots of group leaders in, because no-one wants to take the lead, no-one wants to step on anyone else's toes, so we just sit there and so I end up moving people on and asking the next question and talking far too much. It's hard to know if people are thinking, or just waiting for the next question. So sorry guys!  Had busy day: creche from 9:30-12:00, Debs for lunch and chat, computers to work between 3 and 4, met Ryan to talk about Tanzania fundraising at 4, then met Lizzy and Becky at 5:50 for dinner, then straight off to Navs. Have just got home now - phew!  Still waiting for more strange food experiences - come on you Arbabanels you must eat strange things in your house!!!  Night.

      Well just to keep up with the times I decided to update my blog too! There are tons of cool new ones - only snag you have to imput again all the adjustments you made - like links and stuff. Fortunately I copied my original formula so I could refer back to it - cunning hey!  Haven't got the comments bit back in yet, but promise will do so asap. Does anyone know how you do it so that it carries on from the comments book from before??????

      oh this new set up is wierd. Not sure if I like it or not.  Certainly don't like the brown colour.  Ok what have I been up to?  Well I sort of did some of my assignment on Monday - but not very successfully, and then went and helped Debs paint the walls on her stairs and landing. Great fun - even if I did whinge about having to sand down the paint work first!  Sorry Debs!  Came back and worked unsuccessfully again. You see this is why I don't understand how Melanie can just sit down and write an essay in 1 day.  Like sometimes my brain just doesn't work. So on the first day i wrote 2000 words, but then I only wrote another 500 words during the next 2 sessions.  Am hoping to finish it off on Thursday/Friday though - so please pray that it isn't a day when my brain decides not to function.  Had fun time last night making cards and wrapping paper.  Am such a perfectionist though - it takes me about 1 hour to make 1 card!!  My borther's fiancee has just asked me to help her make the wedding invitations for their wedding which is realy exciting.  We are going to go to this huge craft store and get all the stuff. But even though the wedding isn't until next year, considering it takes me 1 hour per card I guess I ought to start soon!  Had interesting lectures (well don't know if I can call them lectures when there are only 5 people in my class!) today. First one was about how  community health development interacts with other approaches to health promotion and also how do we effectively evaluation community health development - as it is not like your typical medical intervention.  Second one was about the principles and limits of individual behaviour change.  I got really frustrated in this class, because whilst I'm not totally against individual behaviour change I do feel really strongly that often it is used inappropriately.  There is so much focus on changing the 'unhealthy' behaviour and never considering why that person is using that behaviour in the first place.  So say a single mum with 3 kids who lives in a high rise block of flats and has to hold down 2 jobs to make ends meet - a cigarette might be her only relief, the only thing that enables her to cope. Now I'm not advocating smoking, but I believe we should be looking at why she is smoking - helping her with childcare, of economic problems, and such things.  We were disucssing this example of a guy taking drugs today and how could we best approach encouraging him to change his behaviour and stop taking drugs.  The protocol and models say that we should ensure he has the motivation to change, the awareness that what he is doing is unhealthy, and has weighed up the benefits versus the costs. There is no mention about considering why he feels the need to use drugs.  And also I believe that even if he does manage to come off drugs, there will be further work required because probably issues will then arise that the drugs were covering.  It constantly feels like we are trying to change the behaviour and 'patch them up'.  We need to meet targets - reduce the numbers of people smoking, reduce the number of suicides, reduce the number of heartattacks, and so that's what we focus on - instead of actually helping someone to fulfill their potential, to be the person they could be.  We blame the individual and never consider external factors. Like I know I want to change, I know I need to change, I know the benefits of changing outweigh the costs, I have support to change, but there is more to it than that.  If my behaviour is a coping-mechanism, a way of surviving this world, you can't just cut out the behaviour without considering why the behaviour is required and trying to find ways of meeting those needs in other ways. It makes me SO angry.  Sorry for the rant....it drives me mad....a bit like The Mission film!

      Wow what a night!  I went round to Lizzy's last night for a girly night and a sleepover.  Except we didn't do much sleeping!  We had dinner and then snuggled up on the sofa, with candles, a lava lamp and Elgar's cello concerto.  And talked.  And talked. And then talked some more.  So at 4am we decide that we should probably go to bed, so we get into our PJs and are about to go to sleep when suddenly Lizzy realises that there is a fire outside the back of the house.  She goes out to investigate and it really is quite a large, uncontrollable fire.  She lives in a terraced house, where they all have quite small long gardens and at the back of the garden a few doors down this fire was raging.  Was also quite dangerous as it backs onto the local hospital.  So Lizzy rings 999 and suddenly not 1, not 2 but 3 fire engines come with lights flashing and everything.  So there are Lizzy and I in our PJs stood in the middle of the street with 3 fire engine's worth of firemen - some women's dream come true!  They eventually put the fire out, which was probably started by some kids or something and we crawl into bed at 5am. But by this point we are like totally awake and its almost light out, so we got out Vinyl Cafe that I happened luckily to bring with me and listened to the 'Jock Strap'!  Sleep followed immediately.  Woke up at er....1:30pm.  Felt like a proper student, but pretty rubbish (scanky - UK version of the word) too. Started remembering everything that happened last night, or should I say this morning - and at first thought that I had just been dreaming.  So it was an interesting night all round! Not sure I'm going to sleep tonight now though. Oh well.  Oh just remembered about Survivor predictions!  I can't believe tonight is the last night!  mexx

      Ok I have a problem.  The neck of my jar of peanut butter is too narrow, and now that I have eaten the top half of the jar (yes thats in like a week! But in my defense we do have smaller jars than you - like less than half the size) I can't reach to dip my pear into the peanut butter.  What should I do? Please help me.

      Ok my morning:  9:00 Put washing on 9:15 Started working 10:00 Collected washing and hung up 10:15 Resumed working 11:45 break – cleaned bedroom and the kitchen 12:15 Resumed work 1:15 Lunch  So feel my morning has been very productive. Only snag- have written 2000 of the 3000 words (6 pages of 10 for you Canadians!) but haven’t really done the main body yet!! But at least I have some stuff down which is the hardest part. I just find it really hard to sit and write continuously though.  Like I get so bogged down in the detail and I get myself confused. I don’t know how Melanie writes like 20 pages in 2 days. But the topic I have chosen really fascinates and annoys me. I find myself shouting out loud about the injustices and stuff as I’m writing it!!  The title is:   ‘The big bad pharmaceutical companies’??  Comparing and contrasting access to antiretroviral drugs for women for the treatment of HIV and AIDS in Uganda and the United Kingdom.    Oh am not impressed – got Rob right for winning one of the challenges but got Big Tom wrong.  Bet you Melanie is pleased that Rupert didn’t go – maybe he is still in with a chance of becoming the Sole Survivor!  Is next week the last episode?   Am going to pick up Hannah from school and take her to ballet. Jo and the baby are coming home from hospital today - yipee! mexx

      I did it!  I got up at 8:00am with my alarm!  No-one banging on the door, or no going back to sleep.  Felt good.  So after seeing my GP, I popped into town for a few things, and then as I was walking past Starbucks thought, why not treat myself.  Now before you all shriek with horror that I frequented a Starbucks – we don’t have little locally run coffee shops over here, and so we have to go to the main ones – and I choose Starbucks because it does offer Fairtrade coffee and tea – if only as an alternative.  So I bagsied an arm chair and got myself a big mug of hot chocolate and a muffin and settled down to read my book. 2 hours later I realised what time it was!!!  It was just SO relaxing. The constant hum of other people, but not so loud or near that it disturbed me.  And I couldn’t believe it because none of the staff had come and asked me to move (which DOES happen in England).    So it’s been a pretty chilled day today. I feel like I got lots of things accomplished (oh except beginning the man-hunt – maybe will have to postpone that for a while) and I even introduced my flatmates to pears and peanut butter and they didn’t think it was that bad!!  So there’s hope yet!    Have just been busy writing letters to charities asking for donations for the Tanzania trip – no-one has posted any exciting or unusual fundraising ideas in the guestbook. If you are feeling slightly embarrassed or nervous about declaring publicly such things you can always email me!  Got my Survivor predictions in – just got to wait till tomorrow morning to find out the result – hey that could be a good incentive to get up in the morning.  Tomorrow is a WORK day – as in I MUST start writing my assignment. The time has come, I can’t put it off any longer, or read anymore articles – I have to actually write it!!  So goodnight folks.  Enjoy Surivivor!  mexxx

      Ok I just have to say…APPLE and peanut butter DO NOT go.  In fact I would go as far as to say that they were GHASTLY.  Am definitely sticking to the pear and peanut butter snack.  So today has been good.  Apart from waking up late again (well 8:50 rather than 8 – needed to leave flat at 9) things have gone well.  I had my Talk Together group this morning, where I help look after 10 little kiddies under 3 yrs old.  The lady who normally does it with me wasn’t there and this other lady had come who was lovely, but had teenage kids and I think had forgotten how to look after 4 babies at once.  She was very impressed with my ability to feed one baby with one hand, rock another baby in their seat with my foot and assist two 3 yr olds and 2 yr old with a jigsaw puzzle.  Talk about multitasking!  So I was feeling really good about the morning, until one of the other mum’s who was looking after the baby I was feeding (as it’s mum was ill) said that I should have given her the milk before the food.  And had I not realised that she still had her coat on? I thought it was her sweater.  Anyway the baby didn’t overheat or starve so I am trying to think positively and not take the remarks too personally.    Then went to church for a monthly world prayer meeting we have.  The other 9 folks there were all retired people, and were amazed to see a ‘young one’ attending – extra holy points for me!  This was closely followed by a very civilised trip to the coffee shop with Debs (with my Tim Horton’s mug in-tow Melanie!)  Then it was a quick dash to the hospital to catch visiting time on the maternity ward.  I got to hold the baby – SHE IS SSOOOOOOOOO GORGEOUS.  I began feeling very broody (Mental note for tomorrow: begin man-hunt).  She is called Rachel Harriet.  The other kids came in and they are all so proud of her. Ruth, who is 2, just stands there pointing at her saying ‘my baby, my baby’.  Paul, who is 4, was hilarious – he had brought her a teddy and was asking her if she wanted to play with it, he asked her quite simply “nod if you want to and shake if you don’t”.    So after eventually tearing myself away, I went round to Debs for tea.  I suddenly remembered that I hadn’t prepared my study for Navs and so hastily did that, at the order of Debs!!  Then we had tea and watched an episode of ER from series 1, during which Debs disappeared into the kitchen as, which I only discovered later on, she was choking!  She is the quietist, most calm choker I have ever seen/heard.  I wish she had told me because then I could have practiced the Heinrich Manoeuvre on her!     Navs was um…challenging.  Lizzy and I were the only ones from our group there and so we joined with 2 girls from another group and one further girl.  Now I HATE change.  And I am finally beginning to build up some sort of trust and confidence in my group (yes it has only taken me like almost a year), so I get totally thrown when with new people.  I get really anxious and jittery.  So we started off with prayers for each other – a section which I don’t particularly like anyway but in our group we don’t do till the end, by which point I’m more relaxed anyway.  So I tried to suppress my jigging and fiddling and everything else.  But it got better when we got onto the actual study. I even raised the controversial question of how much do we think the New Testament fulfils the prophesies of the Old Testament because it was written to do that?  I don’t necessarily believe this, but I was interested to know what people thought, and at least to get them to think about it.  We were looking at Acts 8 where the Egyptian Eunuch believes and is baptised.  It states in Isaiah 56:3-5 that Eunuchs and foreigners will be included in God’s kingdom.  So I was raising the possibility that they included that particular story in Acts 8, not that it didn’t happen, but there were probably hundreds of stories they could have chosen but that one fitted best as it had been predicted in the OT.  We also had an interesting discussion on whether or not we should question God and faith.  I don’t think I need write my opinions on this one. But let me just say that I did reveal to them that I had in the last few years I questioned God and my faith just a little bit, and have even told God that I didn’t believe in him anymore (not sure who I was talking to therefore!) and I have not be struck down by lightening….yet. So it turned out ok in the end, and was probably a good experience for me.  Right folks, well that’s it for now. Must do Survivor predictions, compose a ditty in the shower and begin the man-hunt tomorrow. Will keep you posted on my progress!  love mexxx

      Well now I’m the one not blogging!  Sorry. So here is a blog.  Monday I woke up late again (this is really annoying me now) and popped into town to get a few things.  I went to get some of my digital photos printed up and I also popped into La Senza (don’t have a total heart attack Melanie – was only looking for a PJ top to go with those bottoms!)  Then I met up with some of the Navs to play ultimate Frisbee.  Our team won the first game 8-0 and then we swapped around teams and we lost 5-4.  Was great fun and Ryan even complemented me on my amazing back-roll!  I discovered acrobatic skills I never knew I had.    I watched Pearl Harbour with my flatmates last night. Slightly patriotic for the Americans but a good film. Except the stupid BBC decided to stop it half way through to show the news!  So anyway didn’t finish until almost midnight.  Today I had lectures.  This morning my class went on an outing!  Well there was only the lecturer and 2 of us, but we went to see this local community project.  About 12 years ago these 2 ladies turned this derelict, rat-infested rubbish site behind their terraced houses into a green garden/play area.  They now hold community events and organise stuff for the kids.  They are still so committed and passionate about improving their community.  It was really inspiring.  I really wanted to get out there and start changing the World, but my lecturer reminded me that I didn’t necessarily need to change the World; I can make a difference in my own way, one small step at a time.  I really like my lecturer he is very passionate about Fairtrade, ethical living, and environmental things.  He just spent the weekend in Wales at this eco-place where you have to generate your own electricity and deal with all waste.  Sounds great fun.  My lecture this afternoon was rather close to the bone, but ok.  Was all about individual behaviour change.  They always encourage us to look at our own experiences in order to attempt to understand how to help others.  So we had to think of something we are trying to change about ourselves (I have just a few!).  We had to ask ourselves if we are aware of our beliefs, do we rationally think about things? How do I respond if my behaviour is challenged?  Why have I become aware that I need to change my behaviour?  What are the constraints to me changing?  What’s holding me back from changing?  Mmmm………  Then met up with Galls (he runs Navs in Brum) to plan some fundraising events to raise money for the guys going to Tanzania this summer.  I am going to write lots of letters – my favourite pastime!!  Anybody have any exciting fundraising ideas?  All suggestions welcome!  Oh – Jo had a baby girl at 10:00 – 7lb 13oz – a little girl who they have called Rachel Harriet!  Thanks for your thoughts.  take care guys mexxx

      well no-one else seems to be blogging, so I guess it's my duty to write something. Unfortunately don't have too much exciting news to tell you. Hasn't been a great day, but hey I made it through.  And for the first time, instead of bottling things up I summoned up the courage against the fear of rejection and phoned Lizzy and popped round there after church this evening.  We ended up having a good chat, and I've just got home now.    What else did I do today? Um... bought an electric toothbrush for 99p - not sure how good it will be at that price but hey! Also made some cards this afternoon. They weren't too bad for my first attempts.  Well I won't ramble on any longer. Sorry for the dull blog, hopefully something exciting will happen tomorrow which will give me something to write about!  Night mexx

      Well I’m not going to brag about my winning the Survivor contest, as I’ve already done that on Mel’s blog!    After 5 hours sleep (which REALLY isn’t enough for me) I got up and went to Lizzy and James’.  I had asked if we could do something for the day, because I wanted to have stuff planned for when I returned from Canada.  And they had gone the whole way and planned a day out except I wasn’t allowed to know what we were doing or where we were going.  So we set off in the car and half an hour later we arrived at the West Midlands Safari Park!!  We spent the day seeing giraffe, elephants, lions, tigers, emus, rhinos, and lots of other bizarre creatures including a water buffalo drinking another buffalo’s pee!!  We had a picnic lunch and an ice cream. Was like being a kid on a day out – fantastic.  Thanks Lizzy and James – you are stars.  Was amazing day, but not feeling so great now.  Think I am very tired.  After 2 weeks at Spring Harvest and then Canada I think it has finally caught up with me.  The prospect of lots of assignments, and having to find a job for the summer, starting to see the lady from church again and other stuff.  Guess I just need to keep everything in perspective.  Keep searching for the grace!

      Can't sleep. It's 2am and my mind is wide awake.  I know I slept in this morning which doesn't help, but still I had a tiring day so I don't understand why I can't drift off to the land of nod. Trying not to get stressed about.  Have read, watched TV. listened to Stu....maybe I should try Melanie's thing and do housework!!

      Am back from Nav camp. Was good, bad, fun, tiring, exciting, nerve racking and pretty much every other single emotion.  But am back at work today and so can't really write much. Am officially homeless at the moment, staying with Nick and Jo and 4 kids - who all woke me up at 7am this morning by whipping away my duvet and jumping on me. So got them all ready for school and then left for work. Tired already. I am really starting to appreciate it just how hard it is for parents.  Am moving into my new house on Thursday so am afriad blogging may be a little sparse this week.  Have a days worth of blog reading to catch up on too.  Can't believe Debsie is in Canada - NOT FAIR!

      Ok so this is my last blog guys.  When I return I am going to have to spend like a week catching up on all of your blogs.  Ahhh what joy!  Had good day today – maybe God does have ears to hear me after all.  Finished all the notes at work which pleased the staff, but made me sure I was now redundant which I was upset about because I’ve really enjoyed working there. But the GP came in and they have decided that since I work so fast they are going to get me to summarise and sort ALL of the medical notes in the practice! So I have a list of about 500 names that need doing – should keep me busy for a while!  So guys I’ll catch up when I’m back.  Take care of yourselves – oh and sort out a reunion date ok?  love mexxx

      ok so everything is packed and moved except the stuff I'm taking on Nav camp (Melanie's phrase not mine!) I get really stressed about this sort of stuff. I HATE having lots of stuff, or even feeling like I have too much stuff, I get really concerned and paranoid about it.  And this time it's especially worse because I am having to leave different piles in different people's houses and so have to apologise and feel guilty/bad to more people.  I just want a VW van. And my room looks so bare and miserable and also I have nothing to do tonight - except blog for you guys. Aahhh what would I do without you?  Last night I fell asleep chuckling. No not to Vinyl Cafe this time but to Victoria Wood. She is a british comedian and just so side-splittingly, wet-yourselfly funny.  Like what she talks about is just everyday life things, but in a way that makes them so totally hilarious. The bit I was watching last night was all about her problems with gyneocological pain and having a hysterectomy - doesn't sound the funniest of things, but believe me it was.    How come Aimee doesn't have a guestbook? Get one Aimee I need to ask you questions! Like why are your days in French?  My copy of the first season of ER has arrived into the shop! I'm going to pick it up tomorrow. But I can't watch it for a whole week anyway - Aaaaaahhhhhhhhh. My patience will have to continue to be tested.  Oh and I definitely am in for a blog reunion just tell me when and where and I'm sure I can just pop in.

Hopefully this way they can keep in touch and let us know how they are doing.  If you want to find out what they are up to check out the Tanzania Tour link on the left.

      I got my results back - well 2 of 3. Got a 70% and a 71%. mmmmmm......not sure how I'm feeling about it. Everyone says Karen it's a 1st for goodness sake, but me being the ultimate perfectionst is yes, but only just and what about the other 29%? And why did I get 75% for my last assignment from these lecturers and this time only 70%? I asked the lecturer and he was like 'maybe I was having a bad day' ummm....that fills you with confidence - the basis of my future rests on whether or not my lecturer is having a bad day.  and as usual I got comments like 'could discuss this further, could write more about this, what about this person's theory?' like if I had an infinite number of words then I would have.  I asked the lecturer what I could have taken out in order to discuss these other things, and he said nothing!!!! What is a girl supposed to do?!! Grrrrr.  Moving day has arrived. I hate change.

      wow I've just had my first harassing email for lack of bloggage - does this now make me an official, fully fledged blogger?   Sorry guys but have been stupidly busy this week and am my room is covered with boxes and piles (apparently you can get medical treatment for this though). My mum is coming up tomorrow to move some of my stuff to a friends house until the 1st July (CANADA DAY!!!) when I can move in to my house - which let me point out has broadband so there will be no excuses then.  She is taking some stuff home and the rest I need for "nav camp" which I'm departing for on Saturday.  So I'm afriad that next week there will be NO blogging at all. Sorry to disappoint.  Its after midnight yet again, so am going to try and go to bed. Oh watched the film The Piano last night when i couldn't sleep - VERY odd film has anyone ever seen it?  xx

      I went swimming! Yippeee. I had forgotten how much I love swimming. I haven't been for almost a year and I love it!  It makes me feel so good: I'm doing exercise, I'm releasing endorphins, I'm using up my pent up energy. I feel so free when I'm in the water.   Worked 8:30-6 and have almost finished all the notes now - uh-oh.  Had good fun with the girls in the office today.  Why are all the environments I'm in all-female?!  Heading for bed.  Goodnight all. Sorry this blog isn't particuarly thrilling at the moment. Summarising medical notes doesn't provide many thrilling reports! Oh except the lady today who was reported as having postnatal depression in 1840!  Flipping heck think I would have postnatal depression if I was still alive after all this time too!!  xxx

      It’s Friday night and all my flatmates are going out, and I’m home alone yet again.  The thing is they didn’t even ask me if I wanted to go with them.  Now fair enough I probably wouldn’t want to go anyway but the point is they didn’t even ask me.    And the person downstairs is playing loud dance music, so my floor is vibrating to the boom boom of her music.    Ok what would platinumblonde say: look at the positives….. errrrr….. I’m saving money, I’m having some time to myself, I’m developing my introvert abilities, and er nope can’t think of a positive to the dance music….any suggestions?  Actually though talking of introversion – I have managed really well at spending an entire week on my own in the office with no windows.  The radio and I are forming a very close relationship!  Haven’t even started talking to myself yet either.

      well my GP boss has just come in and caught me listening to BBC Radio 4 (like CBC) which is not normal for a girl of my age, and said I had good taste in music. This might be ok, or even good, if coming from a young, handsome, trendy man but the GP is like in his late 50s and probably wears slippers and knitted wooly jumpers at home! Must make mental note to listen to young, hip-hop and happening station tomorrow! Yeah right.  At Navs last night ruth had to organise this meditation thing on the things God's given us. She had found some verses and wanted people to sit and 'meditate' on them, but I suggested that perhaps not everyone could just sit there and ponder a verse for a whole 15 mins, and that diff people find different ways more helpful. So we had an art area; a soft cushioned area for people just to chill in; lots of paper and pens for people to write the verse out in their own words or to write a letter to God, or just to note their thoughts, and then tons of candles! It was great. Well I found it really helpful anyway, and it was nice to be able to get invovled in organising something.  Back to the working world.....

      Well today the sun peeped out from behind the clouds - both figaratively and literally.  Was a sticky 27oc here today and I was stuck in my office with no windows!  Well at least I'm reducing my risk of skin cancer hey.    Now I'm working in the grown-up world there isn't much of interest to blog about. Except Big Brother.  I'm shocked at it.  Do you have it in Canada? Its on its fifth series or something here and they try and spice it up more each time, because apparently unlike other countries, the UK one is dull and no-one does anything bad/naughty.  so they've put one less beds in the house than there are people and all the beds are in one room.  They've also done other stuff to try and mix things up.  I think its TERRIBLE.

      Ok so I haven’t blogged since Thursday.  Sorry. Haven’t really felt like it.  Well Friday was work, then kids, then er evening home alone which wasn’t great. Saturday I went walking in the Malvern hills with some friends (Lizzy, James and Lizzy’s friend Zoe) which was lovely – especially since I was sorting out the route and managed to not get them lost.  Then we went to see Harry Potter which so SHOULDN’T be a 12 because it’s so scary.  I was petrified of the dementors.   Today I went with James to church – which is this post-modern church that meets in a hotel.  It was really cool – was all about creation this week and they have like different things going on – so you have a short talk and then you can go to the ‘sofa area’ and do this meditation thingy (NOT as in Buddhist monks), or there was a multimedia presentation thing, and then there was a paint table with this cool thing that you put a piece of paper in, then pressed the button to spin it round and then splodged on the paint and it splattered everywhere because of the centrifuge effect.  I had 2 go-s at it!!  Then we went and had lunch at Spud U Like, which is carbon neutral – so it replaces by planting trees all the carbon dioxide it uses in production and stuff.    So ok weekend in all despite everything else.  Will try and blog more next week, although am working everyday.  xxx  P.S Jonathon – CPN is like a counsellor person.

      Wow what a day. I left the flat at 8:00 this morning, started work at 8:30 - worked until 2:30, drove to see CPN for an hour, drove to Jo's and looked after the kids from 4:30-7:30, then got back home at 8pm. Phew.  Work went well though, didn't get bored and even got through half of an entire box of notes!  The GP said I was good value for money (not sure if thats a compliment or not!)  Just hope I, like Mel, don't work myself out of a job!!  Started watching the last ever episode of ER last night and FELL ASLEEP! It's NOT that I'm not a true fan, I was just real tired. And it was good because it meant I got a good nights sleep, before getting up at 7am.  Yes Jonathon no more moaning on my guestbook!! Tut tut.  I am Frodo according to the LOTR personality test. hmmmm... what does that say? I drag my friends into danger?  I'm determined though.

Well apart from work and stuff - but no more assignments hanging over my head.  I'm so excited....and I just can't hide, lalalala...can't remember the rest of the words.  Can't believe that there was a Survivor tie! How exciting. Um...maybe we should set a Survivor quiz, and the one with the most right answers wins it? I'd be happy to help out with writing the questions.  Bye!!

      Ok so I'm not normally a hypocondriact and not even a real wimp when it comes to pain, but today I was sure I was dying.  I was in the computer room trying to do my assingment and suddenly started getting pain in my chest, then it spread to my back and I couldn't breathe in deeply because of the shearing pain.  My throat felt like it was being burnt by acid.  After the intial "Oh my God I'm dying" I decided that it was probably just heartburn.  But then I started feeling really sick and ended up dashing to the loos and being violently ill.  So eventually decided to go and see the nurse.  Felt like such an idiot. But she was lovely and said that it probably was heartburn but that some people get chronic milder symptoms and others get acute severe pain.  She said the she herself had only had it twice and both times thought she was dying.  So that made me feel much better.  So I'm not dosed up with DISGUSTING Gaviscon - which is like this chalky, milky drink that is totally foul.  So apart from that, work still going - assignment still not done - but have tomorrow now as creche has been cancelled.  No other exciting news - sorry.  xxx

      Just had to blog to say that this is my 100th post! Yippee. I'm a centenarian blogger!!!  I am off to 'camp' today - well this one actually is a camp. I'm doing a kids camp down in Bognor Regis (on the south coast down and left a bit from london for you foreigners) for 5-11yr olds. Plus there is a 11-18yr old stream which I'm hoping to stir well clear of cos they scare me!! Its right by the sea so I'm really excited - no skinny dipping for me though!!&nbsp; In fact it is the same ocean that you Arbarbanels were swimming in right?  well have a good week. k xx

      hey guys. OK a question for you all. Melanie and I were having a nice chat the other day, when I asked the simple question of whether when we speak on the phone it goes up to a satellite of under the ocean, to which Melanie replied horrifidly - you're kidding right?! So this has sparked many a discussion over here.&nbsp; Some say that it goes under the ocean, others that it goes via satellite (as in satellite communication) but which is it? There used to be a time delay when you phoned over to your continent, but that no longer exists. Surely if it is going all the way under the ocean there would still be a delay?&nbsp; Melanie said she watched this programme about how they laid the cables under the ocean, but I'm not convinced.&nbsp; So tell me which it is - and I NEED evidence to prove it.&nbsp;   So my week has been pretty uneventful.&nbsp; Work,&nbsp;kids,&nbsp;sleep and then work.&nbsp; Cycled into town along the canal on Saturday (did you know that Birmingham has more canal mileage than Venice?!) but it was heaving because the sales had just started. I hate it when its like that. So I hid out in the library.   Sunday I took a trip to Kidderminster which is about an hour away from Birmingham, and involves driving through these lovely little quaint villages.&nbsp; My housemate Sara was there on a weekend away and fell hill-boarding and so couldn't drive home. So Mark and I drove there and I drove her car back. (See Melanie some people trust me to drive their car!!   cup of tea!  ) We then went to church where we had a leaving service because our 2 curates (they are husband and wife and jobshare!), the music director and the warden are all leaving. Was a hilarious evening ending up with the vicar and associate vicar being custard pie-d!!!  So tomorrow I'm heading home for about 24 hours before driving down to Bognor Regis (yes the place is as bad as it sounds!) for a Scripture Union kids camp I'm doing for about 10 days. So no more blogging over that time I'm afraid. But the Arbarbanels are back so they can take over for a bit!  So take care guys, enjoy your summer in Canada (we are still on autumn here - yes get the violins out)  k xx

      I'm back...well sort of. Will try and blog more although not sure what to write really these days.  How can anyone compare to the daily shenanigans of Mel's office?!?!?&nbsp; Apparently, according to the newspaper on Wednesday, office staff need to behave more like children in order to reduce the ever increasingly levels of stress. And&nbsp;it reported that one of the best ways to do this was to play pranks on folks!! So there you go.  I'm still working at the GP&nbsp;practice at the moment. This week I've been on reception so have been face-to-face with some very miserable, hostile, aggressive and demanding patients. But some of them are lovely and they make my day. Today I felt so sad for this one lady that I wanted to take her home with me.&nbsp; She arrived from the Congo/Zaire in April and is living in this hotel where they shove all the assylum seekers. She speaks hardly any english and is having to fend for herself. She is pregnant, courtsey of the rebel army soldiers, and most of her family are still in the Congo. She came in with someone today who is possibly her daughter, who herself is pregnant and she also has a 2yr old daughter as well.&nbsp; She only arrived 2 days ago. Can you imagine how daunting, scary it would be? I sat down with them to try and explain how things worked and to register them, which was interesting with my EXTREMLEY basic school french. But we made it.&nbsp; The other staff at the practice were like 'why are you bothering? Just give them forms and tell them to come back when they've done them.'&nbsp; But I just wanted to help them. When I spoke a little french they just smiled like anything and were so thankful. I just wanted to bring them home and look after them.&nbsp;   Bought a canvas today to do a painting for my new room.&nbsp; My housemates (NOT roomies!) and I did some 'modern art' paintings for our living room with left over wall paint and stuff. They are really cool and everyone who comes round thinks that we've bought them for some extravagent price!!  anyway thats enough for now. kxx

      BLOGGERS BEWARE!!!!!!  Here's an outrageous story from the Far North. "The  urlLink Nunatsiaq News  (for full story see:  urlLink http://www.nunatsiaq.com/news/nunavut/40806_08.html )  reports on a blogger being fired from her job because of her blog. A Nunavut Tourism marketing officer was fired last month after a local resident complained about a web site she ran in her spare time. Penny Cholmondeley, known on the Internet as "Polar Penny," was surprised to learn on July 18 that she was being fired because of the online journal, or web log, she had kept since her arrival in Iqaluit in January.  There are some bizarre aspects to this tale and some unanswered questions. The complaint over which Penny was dismissed was apparently made anonymously. One anonymous complaint can get you canned? The nature of the complaint has not been made public either by Nunavut Tourism or Ms. Cholmondeley. Another strange thing is the graciousness with which Penny is taking all of this. She's leaving the frozen North and applying for work in Nanaimo, BC. I'm indignant that such a thing could happen. If you're as indignant and outraged as I am, you might want to drop an email to the person who fired her, Maureen Bundgaard at  urlLink maureen@nunavuttourism.com ."  scary hey.

Am home currently but going up to Edinburgh on Saturday for a few days  vacation . Then I'm back to brum for a church kids thing and then off to Greenbelt, which is the coolest thing ever. then its Rachel's wedding and then back to Brum for some work and money earning before term starts. aahhh exhausted already.
