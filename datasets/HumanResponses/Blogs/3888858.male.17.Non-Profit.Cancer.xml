      so today i am going to DCI. i am so excited.  today has started perfectly.  i woke up and spoke to my wife (my camp wife at least) and then had jello loaf and toaster scrambles.  mmm... they r sooo good.  now i have a cherry coke and im really happy.  i learned a chord on my new guitar, and then talked to syerra.  after that i spoke with alexa and now im talking to brandi.  its a day full of kick ass DCI and talking to people i love.  i think that in honor of DCI i might even shave... maybe... i dunno, i thought that i might grow it out, but i think ill shave.  anyways im still hungry so im gettig more food... i might add more later.  so for now, ciao

      my mood is kind of blah... i dunno what my problem is, BUT i've kinda been in a lot of bad moods lately... on a good note (c sharp... lol) (i'm a dork) i went tubing today. it was a blast... it was james, kelz, amy lefevere, and myself. it was a lot of fun. right now, i'm talkin to 2 of my most favorite camp people... miyaka and allyson :) also... i just got off the phone with keith marie... he tried to call me his bitch and i called him down for it... it was funny... so keith: who's whos bitch now??!! ANYWAY... they fired rachael and merle is a nazi... as a matter of fact, i really hate the guy... there is only one other person on my 'i wish these people to hell' list... and that's karen (if you don't know... it's a looooong story). anyways... school starts tuesday. :) :( i can't wait for TWINE to get started back up! well... i'm kinda pissy and don't feel like typing any more...

      i finally figured out my password... i don't know what happened, but it wouldn't let me sign in.  anyways... it's fixed. WHEW!!!  after a loooong summer at C.A.M.P., i am finally home.  now, i'm just getting ready for school.  i have my schedule (a good one at that), a new backpack, new shoes, new glasses, and new shorts.  now all that i need is some FUCKING shirts!!!  ugh!!! i hate the new dress code!!!  *breathes in deeply... counts to 10*  (back on track now...) i spent my day at nana's.  i woke up at about 11 and we all went to breakfast.  we is mel, sheldon, dustin, and i.  and breakfast is really sonic... BUT, that doesn't matter.  then we went to nana's i worked in the yard until about 5:15ish.  yeah... i HATE yardwork.  i have blisters and rough hands now.  and yes... i am whining...  anyways then i came home and played my guitar.  i didn't watch TV because i am grounded on my only god damned week of vacation for the entire fucking summer... *hurrumph*  at least i have a 3 day weekend.  i'm allowed to be on the comp, and listen to music.  i can't go anywhere, watch TV, or talk on the phone.  doesn't really sound that bad except for that it is my only god damned week of vaction.  camp rocks though... anyway i'lll blog later... i'm going to fill out a CityYear application.  check it out...   urlLink www.cityyear.org  i think that's the site... i dunno...
