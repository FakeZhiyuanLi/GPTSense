      I present the most boring yet funniest exploration of two people on NTL ISP trying to figure out what on earth is wrong with geocities. I have to warn you though, it does include some very bad language.    Melissa Jane says: I'm sooo pissed off tho J.I.G says: y? Melissa Jane says: friken alll geocities not loading on my comp J.I.G says: geocities = gay Melissa Jane says: yeh but it works for everyone else! J.I.G says: free maybe but nevertheless, gay Melissa Jane says: I need help J.I.G says: i assure u it doesnt, its crap for everyone J.I.G says: i might have some webspace   Melissa Jane says: no i mean is www.geocities.com loading for you? J.I.G says: no Melissa Jane says: does it come up with server cannot be displayed J.I.G says: well i didnt give it a chance to, it wud have tho afta about 10mins of trying to connect Melissa Jane says: yeh - same here   Melissa Jane says: grrr so annoying! J.I.G says: server = boom J.I.G says: it happens Melissa Jane says: but what I don't get is it works for other people J.I.G says: hoom? J.I.G says: and when? Melissa Jane says: er several people I've chatted too and I've even talked a perosn through making a site and they've come up with soemthing but I can't see the frickin page Melissa Jane says: yesterday and it didn't work then either J.I.G says: hummm..... J.I.G says: let me try something Melissa Jane says: k J.I.G says: strange J.I.G says: it pings fine Melissa Jane says: wtf? J.I.G says: i cba to explain ping, but basically it finds if a server/comp on the net exsists and how fast a net connect it has Melissa Jane says: yeh Melissa Jane says: so that's okay - but its just not finding the server when I try to connect to the page??? Melissa Jane says: *hopeless attempt at techy talk* J.I.G says: hummmmm,....... J.I.G says: most strange Melissa Jane says: oh get ova yourself,,, this is tr√©s annoying and I need some bloody help, I need to access my sites J.I.G says: give me the exact links to ur sites J.I.G says: well, just one Melissa Jane says: www.geocities.com/darius_undone J.I.G says: let me try a few things Melissa Jane says: okay J.I.G says: how do u load ur webpages? via ftp? Melissa Jane says: errr wat? Melissa Jane says: english please I only know french and html J.I.G says: ok ok J.I.G says: u write ur webpage in html/php/woteva, then how do u get that on the web? Melissa Jane says: I upload it using geocities filemanager J.I.G says: damn Melissa Jane says: y? J.I.G says: its too complicated for the likes of non-nerds   Melissa Jane says: try me, in english atleast J.I.G says: u no on websites they have the http bit? Melissa Jane says: kk J.I.G says: well, http stands for somat like hyper-threading something or other, which basically means when u go on a link, itll display what its told to display (pictures, text etc etc) Melissa Jane says: yah J.I.G says: ftp displays the same websites as files J.I.G says: IF it supports it Melissa Jane says: you lost me J.I.G says: .... Melissa Jane says:  same websites as files? J.I.G says: ermmm.... how can i put this simply.... Melissa Jane says: think like your talking to someone stupid J.I.G says: think   Melissa Jane says: har har J.I.G says: ur websites consist of many files, pictures, writting, code etc etc, instead of internet explorer showing the information in these files, it just shows a list of file names Melissa Jane says: yes like the em pages sometimes on sites where it has files and no picture etc Melissa Jane says: like index.html etc etc J.I.G says: this makes it v. easy to upload/download files to update a website J.I.G says: yes, sort of... J.I.G says: let me see if i can link u 2 mine, then u'll understand Melissa Jane says: ok J.I.G says: ftp.mattmorgan.34sp.com/ J.I.G says: copy that into the address bar Melissa Jane says: bloody hell Melissa Jane says: asking me to sign in J.I.G says: u need my password   J.I.G says: but if knew my password then u could log in, and see all my naughty files   Melissa Jane says: well let me get this straight right, this ftp thing is like a program you can download http://www.daydreamgraphics.com/tutorials/list.php?action=list&cat_id=6&id=96 and then you keep files such as picture and such there, now please tell what the fuck does that have to do with a bloody website and files? Melissa Jane says: sorry dead frazzled and confused here, I'm probably driving you up the wall J.I.G says: i told u that u wudnt understand   Melissa Jane says: *cries* J.I.G says: u can d/k programs to make it EASIER to access ftp websites J.I.G says: IF ur websites supported ftp then i could change the files u wanted to change without even looking at it   Melissa Jane says: okay, but I havn't got a frickin clue how to add ftp into my sites J.I.G says: u can't, its done by the server owners, geocities in ur case Melissa Jane says: so then y can't I see my site now then? Have geocities changed to ftp or something J.I.G says: hey! Melissa Jane says: I'm just the odd html nut here and thats just about as far and my sites go J.I.G says: u do have ftp Melissa Jane says: do i? J.I.G says: wats ur p'word? Melissa Jane says: I don't know   J.I.G says: and username for that matter Melissa Jane says: how do u kno I have ftp? J.I.G says: cuz im on it now   Melissa Jane says: how???? Melissa Jane says: like how did you get on my ftp? J.I.G says: ..... Melissa Jane says: I'm trying here really I am, I'm not just being thick J.I.G says: i have a special program, i typed in ur link (http://www.geocities.com/darius_undone), changed it to ftp.geocities.com/darius_undone J.I.G says: and voila, it works J.I.G says: brb tea Melissa Jane says: OMFG!! Melissa Jane says: omg... havn't got a clue what I'm doing Melissa Jane says: spamming myself but hey - god... ahhh apaprently I'm logged in Melissa Jane says: err - this is probably annoying u by now but I just can see a blank page and it says use 'copy to folder' etc Melissa Jane says:   This is a READ-ONLY FTP site. If you want to update your Yahoo! GeoCities web site use your Yahoo! id and password to login. Do NOT use "anonymous".  Melissa Jane says: I'm looooosssstttt *whimper* J.I.G says: bak Melissa Jane - Wah! says: thank god! J.I.G says: ermmmm..... Melissa Jane - Wah! says: wat? J.I.G says: wtf u on about?

J.I.G says: change files, upload files for ur website Melissa Jane - Wah! says: okay but will I be able to actually see my site? on geocities.com J.I.G says: no Melissa Jane - Wah! says: Hmm so this is like an offline way to upload things. Its just like using filemanager yeh? Melissa Jane - Wah! says: uploading editing etc etc J.I.G says: ding ding J.I.G says: uve got it Melissa Jane - Wah! says: finally J.I.G says: sadly i cant log in Melissa Jane - Wah! says: y?

J.I.G says: connection closed: server timeout Melissa Jane - Wah! says: wtf... god another thing wrong J.I.G says: works fine anonymous, just means i cant access ur files   Melissa Jane - Wah! says: Mmmm   so it won't let you loggin J.I.G says: oui Melissa Jane - Wah! says: On many FTP sites, you are automatically logged on anonymously, so you can view or download files. To upload, rename, or delete files, you may need to log on using a special user name and password. Also, different areas of the same site may require different logons.  J.I.G says: well done Melissa Jane - Wah! says: its from the help file... lmao J.I.G says: i figured   Melissa Jane - Wah! says: so mister genius do you have cluey geocities will now load? Melissa Jane - Wah! says: not* Melissa Jane - Wah! says: wishful thinking that J.I.G says: no J.I.G says: darius doesnt have an o right??

      Geocities is doing that seemingly annoying thing where it just refuses to work on my computer no matter what for about two weeks. This so does not help when I have two affiliates I need to add and I was hoping to do a big update of ISW this weekend. I hate it when this happens.  On other news I have a stress free and quiet weekend ahead of me (hopefully) with Callum half way across the country (thank god for that miracle) I have him completely out of the way so I can just... chill. Big massive sigh and dose of fatigue there, can't wait to get to my bed I can't, I can just crawl under the covers and sleep, forever if need be.

      Oh I've had such a spiffing day today, you know double maths then a fantastic English test, a little bit of dinner duty then a quiet chat about one of my best friends leaving me on my own in six weeks. Oh yes simply wanderful.  And to round it all off I find a nice little e-mail from one of my internet buddies who I refuse to speak to - one of those e-mails I know I'm going to have a guilt trip over. Yeah, well honey I've just about had enough guilt and all that hozzah to last me a lifetime today - so no  Helen  I will not remove your name from my journal, nor will I remove the link from my signature.  You know that line simply makes your views chrystal clear,  The letter in question is a very warped version of the truth, and since most of the evidence of the actual events have now been deleted along with the official message board, I very much object to having my name connected with such an ugly and twisted letter. So please remove my full name, and my business name - ArtyHelen, from your site.   Twisted? Ugly? I'm going to lace the words I wish to say with: you have no right to call the Engish language used in that letter such a thing. Sure that letter was not written by me so I will not remove it - it was written by someone else so I do not hold the blame for flashing you're name on the internet. Sure I posted it here - which is my own thoughts and feelings. The letter was posted at a time which you know was bad for me thanks to you, I thank God I've got people who actually can talk to me and show me what I'm doing wrong instead of accusing me of things.  I'm on either side of you lot split up into two groups here, I see why you don't get on and I swear you all act like seven year olds on this matter. Sure I wasn't there at the time because I was blind not to see. This will probably result in yet another big ho-hah over journals and whatnot, but you,  all  of you all bitching about eachother and spreading rumours (yeah you thought you had me fooled, I'm not 100% sure about the WWC just yet, I'm surveying you lot for the while, I'm keeping my eye on you and I'm finding out the truth), I stand by my words that my head will never be turned by idle gossip.  So just, nasty words and little differances aside - get over it!  rant over.

      Oh my God - just been going over chapt. 1 of Affie 'cos its crappiness was driving me mad, I did edit it before stupid word died on me - so startes changing that annoying scene near the end, totally edited out the kiss and came up with this:   "You idiot, trying to fool me!" She pushed him away.  "Fool you, like taking candy from a baby - I nearly got a way with it too," I sly grin settled on James' mouth.  "Stupid, foolish, good-for-nothing," She paused trying to think of some good enough words to describe him, "Arh, you wanker!" but sadly Lily was a bit low on colourful language at that time.  "Ah, holding back on the worse now are we - can't think of anything to say to little old me," James grinned.  "How can I when you've tried what you do with every other girl you ever layed eyes on, God forbid formed a friendship with - you may think you're God's gift to women Potter but you don't fool me,"  "'Course I don't you wouldn't know how to act even one bit ladylike if the word bit you on the bum!"  "James dearie you don't even know what ladylike is yourself, judging by the tarts you decide to mingle with."  James sighed deeply and threw his hands int he air for the second time that night, "You don't even give it up do you, just because you aren't anywhere near the high point of the popularity scale -"  "Like I'd want to be,"  "No, you just don't care to think," James added mumbling to himself, "Too busy with your nose stuck in a bloody book."  "Go pick on one of your followers, I bet they're outside the door right now, all in a big rush to serve their almighty leader." Lily rolled her eyes and headed for the girls tower.  She ignored the feelings that we're bubbling inside her and climbed the many stairs to her dorm room, before she turned a sharp corner she heard from the common room a shout:  "You just don't see Evans,"  And nothing more was said.

      Stumbled across a new fanfiction yesterday called something more, I haven't read a Lily/James school life fanfic since Lily Evans and the Elf-Nymph Necklace - which by the way is well worth a read sometime - its really good. Starts off with a crush which I can really relate too, actually I can't believe I haven't thought about Sam all holiday, God he's so damn sexy. I used to dream about him you know, I hope no-one from school reads this blog, I'd die! Hmm well this fanfic is good, its real you see, proper not out of it like the others, and the picture of James is painted in my mind as actually looking handsome, God this author must have talent. Sirius' character looks fine too, yum, dark looks is what I totally go for - well Sam is an exception - but Darius! Phoar! Yum.. Darius, has these like really dark chocolate eyes that sometimes seem black, whith gorge thick eye-lashes, oh and not to mention such a sexy stomach, with a landing strip included... I could be here for a few hours you know... Mmmmm.

      I have a really annoying cat outside my door crying like there's no tomorrow which really is not helping me. Been working on Inferno Sprite Workstation, yes I do think the world may be coming to an end. Hopefully if I do about several pages a day then I could get this damn thing finished some time soon, I've been working on getting the whole of this site done for about six months now. But  suppose I do have my awful excuse which I don't really want to use. Well, anyway I finished uploading the crapest fanfiction I ever layed eyes on - it was a Harry/Hermione one, God I hate those 'shipped fanfics. I only stick to PoU because it has excellent plot and is very well-written. I was nearly sick with the horrible and disgusting sweetness of it. Not to mention that because I'm such a nut, I've been beta-ing the fics as I upload them, God I never knew writers who could make so many spelling mistakes! Raaaaaaa!

      My computer is dying and its not fair. I turned on the computer and checked out  urlLink Aparecium Designs  to see for any updates, when I remembered I'd forgotten about my update this week. I was after all on a break for the past few days, and I hadn't done that much because I sent about nine avatars last week. I decided to work in PhotoPlus for a bit and  create some buttons, they turned out alright but I was just getting sick of doing all the graphic editing stuff - and giving myself a headache - when the damn internet decided to crash. So I gave up and decided that being as I was so good last time then I'd leave my update with those, about four buttons I'd done. I though I might as well clear out my Affirmation file because it was basically getting jam packed with graphic files that I wasn't using, now the damn thing keeps saying its performed an illegal operation and needs to be closed down. That's it, means I've now got to turn off the machine for about twenty minutes and let it cool down, I can't wait until we get a new computer, I'm fed up of this annoying thing!

      Was talking to Pat about how the mods have hurt me in the past and she pointed out about when I went off the rails. This was during the RGWT debate when Helen was mean to me I think, can't really remember. I know I was feeling really ill at the time and I came across my past uJournal entry, I nearly peed myself with how bad it was!  These past few days I really haven't been well, even though I've had to go to school, which have been close to hell. It's near impossible to walk that evil distance and up those steep hills each morning, when I've been late out of bed twice and ready to throw up. But I've been sadly pushed out the door each morning to get my butt into gear and get some mock SATs done, in Maths. I'm fucking confused over each test, because I've just been so dizzy with sickness and the school don't give a shit about me to send me home i.e: I refuse to sit in that boring sick room and wait until atleast one in the afternoon before I can be sent home.  The thought of going to College after the summer is bloody scary to me, so that isn't helping my stress levels either, especially when we got our choice forms through. There's even more scrabbles going on about who's putting who down on their friend option, because I'm not keen to include Kirsty into my option (she's been annoying me all year and I feel I'm better off without her), but I don't want to make her feel left out. I haven't been able to get out bed each morning too. But, I've also had this HUGE lack of faith which has scared me a bit. Yesterday I was making my usual six-a-day post on the Darius message boards, saying that I'm keeping away from the Mercury thread cos it's giving me a headache. I've always been worried about what people think about me when I post, and it's all come back again, because I said old feelings were coming back what I meant was, as quoted: During the RGWT miming debate, I wrote a huge post about my opinion, which I hoped would be noticed, then it was just completely scrapped up about this miming which I really think should not have been bought up in that thread. Because I wrote some more and tried to include myself in the talk over Mercury going down, but I think people just ignored me after a while, like they get sick of me.  And I was not feeling very well last night either, so what I typed sometimes didn't reflect what I meant. So then someone comes along and types about yeah that's right but maybe I'm being selfish there (not exact words but that's the impression I got), which I just totally blew out on and said I was leaving. Right, maybe that was good, afterall this obsession with Darius is stupid! I mean, how many people would stare day and night at pictures of a popstar who once had this greasy hair and silly goatee? Who would treasure a crap picture of a hug that probably didn't mean much? Who would persist all the time that music meant something? Me, that's who. And for a while last night, I didn't like myself, I didn't like what I did, what I wrote and who I was. I thought fuck this world and I'll see you in Hell when I've sliced my wrists. I was on the verge of putting way all my Darius CDs, taking down the posters and taking a one-way trip out of DariusLand forever. I challenged myself to not think about Darius all day, and do you know what? Snow will fall in Hell before I can forget Darius just like that.  I tried hard I really did, but then I was just feeling so terrible when I got home that I curled up in bed and put 'Freefall' on my CD player. I listened hard and I listened good, and now I know that I can't loose faith, it just means too much to me to forget it. Music is my life source, like an escape. I can't perform it but I can see the lyrics behind the beat sometimes, and I know that that's something special. I don't know if I can go back though, if I can revisit the message boards, battle all the comments I've more than likely started. I'm going now, going back I hope. There it was, my attempt at being anti-Darius, it lasted like a lifetime, but atleast I've learnt something.    She then sent my the letter she was going to send, but she didn't when she found out I was all right, only just managed to accept it before I had to log off:  Letter removed due to unpoplar demand. How come I feel like now people have read what was at the time an innocent post, like I've gone double and turned on everyone? Its back again, guilt trip 101 coming in for landing.

      I sat alone for about five minutes I think, just sitting and thinking about my actions. God I‚Äôm such a bitch at times. It didn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôd read Helen‚Äôs last post, her casting me off to the big blue. All day since I read Rachel‚Äôs post on those comments I felt short of breath, getting more and more hammered into the ground with the weight of the nasty things that had been conversed. I suppose I reacted a bit too over the top, but it really set something off in me. I spend my time on the internet making friends to get away from people bullying me. And what do I do? I go and almost attach a massive sign to my head that says ‚ÄòCome and get me, I‚Äôm really easy to be nasty to‚Äô. I wish I could turn the clock back and not have said a thing, have held my hand still and remembered that the freedom of speech means nothing, because I‚Äôm worth nothing. It hurt a lot when I tried to suggest things. When I did what I‚Äôd do with anyone because I‚Äôve found that even adults act like children, just forget everything and be friends. I selected the best way around things, but no. People just had to take the wrong end for the sake of it, to tell me that I don‚Äôt have the right to do this or that. When I know I didn‚Äôt in the first place, when I said clearly that I wasn‚Äôt suggesting that.  I think I did the best thing before I really hurt myself, because I felt like I was just fighting a battle on my own. But then after I‚Äôd left, although I want to go back, but I know they won‚Äôt miss me. I sat there after dinner thinking about what I‚Äôve done today, I didn‚Äôt make myself proud. Then I smile at myself at how uncanny my last thought was, the lyrics of Dive In going through my head.  I drowned.

      I'm so annoyed at the moment first of all because of this:   Hi Zoe, Apologies that you have been left in "limbo". Unfortunately this is beyond our control as BMG no longer commission us to run the Darius message board, so it will now not be in use. We suggest you visit the official Darius website to see if a board is up and running there - or contact BMG direct. Regards, ArtScience Ltd.   So the official message boards are gone, for good... God I wish I weren't so wrapped up about the reply concerning Darius' record label:   I have today sent this email to Kate Lower ... I will let you know if there is a reply  Dear Ms Lower  I am writing to you on behalf of some very very worried fans of Darius Danesh in the hope that you can please, please please help.  For the last ten days the official message board on the Dariusmusic.com website has been out of action and the website itself has been "up and down" and we have noticed that all the info from it has either been cleared or has not been updated.   We have seen things like this happen before for other artists just before their contracts have been terminated and some of our more nervy colleagues are getting extremely worried that something awful is happening in Darius' career. We have picked up various indications from snippets we have found in magazines and press reports that his new album is finished but since there has been no "official" news from him for such a long time, we are deeply concerned.  In order to stop all this unnecessary worry, might it not be a good idea to issue some kind of statement please  It could be that artscience.net, the company running the website might be in difficulties. There has been no indication on the internet by the posting of "sorry this website is being updated" or "sorry, technical difficulties in progress" to give any idea of what is going on. As many people virtually "live" on these messageboards, being unable to log on, causes a large degree of distress.  There is a sister website to dot.com at www.dariusmusic.net run by Rachel (aka Sonnet) where a lot of this stressing is going on. I do not like to see people worried unnecessarily yet as the hard core fans of Darius, those who have followed him from day one, I think we deserve to know what is going on.  I have been asked to write to you since I was in communication with you last year during Darius' tour. I was the person who made the BQT, the quilt or banner that made the full round of the tour, only to get either lost or stolen on the last leg to Hammersmith. It has still not been found.   Whatever else happens we will never ever give up on Darius, because we love him so much.  Please come back to me as soon as possible. There are so many very very unhappy people out here.  Yours sincerely   Patricia Gardener aka Trishiboo  I hope this has some effect.    Boo   I tried to talk to someone about this, but Tom was being a right twit:   J.I.G says: hi J.I.G says: whats this news then? Honey Bee - Official Message Boards For DariusMusic.Com...

      That last journal entry was so messy, but I suppose I do go off the rails in presentation when I'm excited.  Been working with the the kids at Holiday Club today, doing the Ship Shapes (Ei Ei Capt'n, Arr) theme. I got dragged out of bed at about quarter to eight this morning, set the go in the bathroom and have a shower, then my Dad hogs the bloody bathroom for about three hours. I must admit though, I am in my Dad's bad books at the moment because last night, I accidently knocked the Playstation off its shelf; so Dad took it out Callum's room and chucked it on the floor. Callum was in tears and was calling me all sorts, and I mean rude all sorts, for an eight year old he sure has a wide vocabulary. I stormed down stairs and had a go at my Dad because he was being such an idiot, he always over-reacts at these kind of things, what can you expect the guy's a P.E type teacher and has that threatening edge to his voice. In the end I told him he needed anger management classes, and I got away with it too.  This morning was bit of a rush because we were running a teensy bit late, so I missed my chance to get a freakin' T-shirt at the club. Aparently because I got my application to be a table helper this year late I was 'floating' around and had to wander to any place that needed help. Today I was helping out table A with the year three's and Thomas this adorable special needs kid. Thomas is alright, he's a bit mean though because he spent the whole while telling me to shut up. But he was lovely when doing the quiz near the end, Mary had to go off to take some kiddies to the loo so I was left in charge of Thomas for a bit, the cutie practically jumped on my lap when our side won the quiz.  Going on with my morning, I was pretty lucky because I didn't have to do much but be really talkative and talk baby-like with the kiddies. Mananged to put my hand up before-hand for the messy game (cringe) before the kids arrived, so I was called up with about three other helpers to do the messy game. Oh God it was horrible, we had to get on our knees and suck up cold rice pudding through straws. I worked on a two personed team and all the kiddies had to shout "heave" the cheer us on. I never want to eat rice pudding ever again...  I just sat and went around helping a few other tables before dashing off the go home at the end, I hate staying around for the prayer with the leaders at the end, they sit there in complete silence for ten minutes just thinking about God. I might be into that when I'm older like but I do have a life right now.  I can't remember what we're making tomorrow, but go have look in my guide booklet tonight, well I must dash.

      Hey'll check out the new journal layout, isn't it fantastic? I've been trying to watch the new Harry Potter trailer for the past half an hour again, still will not work. Thank god the computer has only crashed once today, I really hope it doesn't crash again. My fingers are itching to type, the official Darius message boards are down, have been for the past forty eight hours-ish. I'm really missing my daily Darius intake, I'll go bonkers like last time I tell you. I feel another pulling hair out and rocking back and forth fit coming on.  School was pretty crap, expecially because Katie-Anne is away, science was so boring without her. Maths was even worse, Zara kept penning me while Mearsby wasn't looking; I did get her back though. Lunch time was alright with Kim and co. Although they spent most of lunch speculating about person X and talking about Kim's pink and fluffy dildo.  I'm destracting myself with journal entries, when I really, really writing atleast a tiny bit. To show you how bad this situation actually is, then I'll provide this, the work since before Christmas:  Nothing  Really good yep?

      Preview of Sabido Por La Vez √öltima:      Flames sprouted from lying bodies, long killed by one stray zooming spell. Screaming echoed through the halls of the once grand home for magical learning. Students of all ages tried their hardest to stand against those that tried to catch them, they searched their knowledge for any type of spell to grant them safety, any way to wriggle out of the situation. None was successful.      Teachers attempted to protect the ones they'd taught and come to know over the past years, tried to use their own powerful and matured understanding of magic to continue the peace that once resided with them all. Still, few stood against the looming shadows of the evil that graced the building. Those shadows, known as death eaters to you or I, pulled into the dark by uneasy upbringing or a family of those before them served, only their master.      They did as was told to them and they obeyed, enjoying sweet but fickle revenge to their desires in the process, but indeed promises were kept and fulfilled that night. Their ranks spread far and wide across the school to, as they were told, kill if necessary any child or adult whom got in their way. They did, with enoyment.      "Get off of me!" A girl of the oldest attending her education tried to scream but her protests were muffled with the musty folds of a deatheater's cloak. He grinned foolishly while he fumbled with the girls robes, but then raised a dagger high to show it glinting in his gripe. A dagger made of strong silver taken from the egg lining of a rare dragon in Sweden - the rarest of the rare.      "No - no, please. Please don't kill me!" The girl cried, tears falling down her cheeks while she threw her arms about aimlessly. But to no avail her screams died in her throat once her attacker pulled his arm up high then plunged, sharp and practised, the weapon deep into her heart.      I can remember clear as day watching the scene unfold in front of me knowing I could do nothing - the past was the past and now, wedged into place by forces too high to mention, was impossible to alter. The stain of that girls blood splattered onto the stone wall behind her body still haunts my fleeting memories when I slip into sleep. Its hard to forget that she was one of the first, the first of the blood spilled of that time, that time when past repeated.      He followed up his perfected move again and again, not stopping until he was sure he would not even hear a whisper from the girl, not anymore. But there, several paces down were a group of youth being dragged by capturers to what was the great hall of Hogwarts then, one girl named Hermione Granger was being pulled by her bushy curls of hair. Trickles of blood dripped down from her scalp and left a smearing trial along the floor.      She was crying out in agony I could clearly tell, her back writhing each time she was yanked over a step or a piece of rock jutting out from the stone floor. She was joined but four other prisoners of the crime. A boy, wild red hair and fading freckles told me clearly his last name, even now his family were recognised for their traits, he groaned and let them chuck him about like a rag doll. His limbs

      Does it ever end?   Checked out Stand By Me on fanfiction.net being as I'm totally bored and trying to write down some notes about a new fanfiction I'm hoping to write (and its gonna be a long one)... I thought Id see what these sick minded people would write about.   And what did I find? Bloody Chris and Gordy slash! It really annoys me because it practically slates the consept of those two scenes where Gordy and Chris show their true friendship. I mean, these are kids! Just because they cry on each others shoulders (because of some deep issues which would make any kid crack) people think they're destined to be together!  Its horrible, they're all sick-minded! Who in their right mind would like reading slash? Its just not right, totally not right.

      The internet has been annoying me for the past hour because this stupid Spad thing kept coming up with a homepage that included porn. Ew!  Thankfully I found out the problem, somehow this stupid Spad file managed to download itself into my C drive files. Deleted it now, seems to have cured the problem. Now on with the website crafting.  Oh yeah, Marion's asked me if I'd like webspace at Aparecium... like she had to ask me?

      Melissa should be sleeping in bed with this rotten cold she's could, but she should also be going out to deliver her papers. Melissa shouldn't be sitting her mindlessly spamming her blog, nor should she be sitting here when she has to go out in less then two minutes. Melissa shouldn't be sitting here in this comfy chair when she really needs the loo either.  Melissa should be working on new tutorials, avatars, fanfiction re-formatting and a certian website which has been sitting in her files for over six months. But Melissa can't be arsed right now.

      Just started work on ISW again (I told you I was ill). Had just about enough time to do a whole fanfiction called watching which means now I've done the whole of the Draco&Ginny fics and the Harry&Hermione fics too.  Now I've got to do all my leaflets (eight, eight! Bloody eight lots!) which will take me all night and with a silly cat behind me who looks like she's just rolled over and died.  Oh horrah!

Okay so I'm meeting up with some people from the Darius message boards to sign Darius' brithday card. So totally hyper here. Shopping too. Talking of shopping... Mum finally brought me those dolly shoes, after she got herself some of course, god she's so evil sometimes. Brought myself a new totally stylish black top, cost me ¬£12.99 but worth it, I've been after a top like this for ages, and its got lovely diamond bits at the top.

      Just finished my papers, well not delivered them but just put in the leaflets and got things ready to go for tomorrow. I had P.E today and we were doing this sprinting practise and I totally pulled some muscle in my leg and it hurts like heck!  God I'm bored, anyone up for some HTML formatting?  btw - don't you just love the new layout? It fab, took me most of last night do (ditching the homework idea - wtf was I thinking?) and then I still have problems. Well I love it anyways. Its dedicated to Katie anyway, cos we're the best bum chums. We  sat just talking today feeling kinda sad 'cos she goes away in like a week so we gathered that we are indeed soul sisters - I'm gonna miss her so much.

      Had a really fab day yesterday. I rang Katie-Anne last night - Eurovison night - just after I'd checked out J.K's official site (it rocks). She asked me straight away if I wanted to go out with her and her Mum on Sunday just going around Derbyshire, I didn't fancy spending another day making my eyes go square, so I accepted.  Well, just after I come off the phone for a loo break, I got my period. So annoying, talk about bad timing too. Sometimes I hate being female. Sunday morning and I felt terrible I'd gotten up early so I was really bored and hot. Yeah yesterday was really hot, air shortages all round I think. Katie was about two hours late but soon we were on our way, Katie's Mum is fab, she had a really good laugh with both of us. All three of us walked around Bakewell, ate some lunch and then took a trip to Eyam. Honestly we'd out for a little stroll in the bioling heat and then sat in the car - Hot! As soon as we shut the doors we were like gasping for air, it was like an oven in there.  I remember having the window open by just a bit so I was trying to coax some air in, I looked like a right prat. Katie persuaded me to go to this Eyam museum, it was pretty crappy but okay. The only interesting thing was this wax model of a man with Plague symptoms, really gross.  Finally we headed home and were being stalked by Mister Munroe trying to get us to get back to Rock Solid, well that's who we thought it was anyway. Nearly home and there's this dippy driver in front of us! He enjoyed driving more in the middle of the road than on the left, he went over the lines 33 times (we were counting).  Today wasn't much of an improvement, turned up at school in a skirt (again) and the most embaressing tight replacments ever. It was hot today too, but not as hot as yesterday thank god - but everyone was complaining of being really hot, come on I wore a jumper all day and wasn't one bit really warm. Lot if wusses all of 'em..

Right now I'm going to finish off a few things that need doing like a few graphic requests, some graphic editing etc. Talking about graphics, Monday night and I was even more knackered. Someone (no naming) well a friend sent me Darius! Okay not Darius himself but I did have a good view of Big D. I nearly had frekkin' heart attack. Thankfully I see some sense and have edited the picture, atleast Darius' dignity has been kept a little:   urlLink Here

      I am so pissed off now. I'm fed up that whenever I'm at school, because I don't take hair-brush with me Katie-Anne and company decide its so funny to mess up my hair. This just makes me want to hit them because basically, it frizzes up my hair and I look like a fucking spag.  Its drives me barmy with anger because I HATE it!!! Its so fucking annoying! But my dad decided to come and mess up my hair just now, and that pisses me off even more! I mean I HATE having frizzy hiar! Then he decided to tease me, and I hate that because I'm not a kid anymore - and my dad's bigger than me so he actually hurts.  Then there's Callum the twat just standing there taking the piss out of me! Why can't they leave me alone? I told them to P off but they didn't listen. I even got told off for telling them to P off and I didn't even use the full word. I mean I'm 14 for God's sake! They should be damn lucky I don't send swear words at the them left right and center, I hardly ever swear at home!  God I'm so fucking pissed off right now!

      You know its amazing what you find our when you read enough of something. Like last summer I was totally into DragonBallZ fics so I used to read about the good storylines. Because some of the authors were Japanese they included words or their language and some who did in-depth studies (damn optimistic buggers) included traditions. Like I know what  ki  means and I know a few Japanese words like  sensei  means teacher or master and  chan  is added onto a name when referred to someone younger than you or a good friend.  I think it was even the Misadventures fic which told me about the sneezing thing. Like I was reading Elemental Genesis today and there was a part:  Apparently, Grey Tower High not only went into the magical arts, but also into muggle subjects.  He had a lot to catch up on.  I swear that if I ever somehow meet the person who made up algebra, I‚Äôll kill them!  He didn‚Äôt notice the small girl in the front of the crowd sneeze suddenly right after this thought passed his mind.  I mean I totally agree with Night (Harry) about the algebra thing, but when that girl sneezed, I couldn't help but laugh. For those left in the dark, when someone sneezes the Japanese believe that someone is talking about you.  I'm totally enjoying this fanfiction by the way, I want to know what I was drinking before I found it, its bloody-tastic. I totally recommend it to anyone.

      Just got back from school about an hour ago, finally SATs are over. We had a Shakespeare paper in the morning which was pretty easy - but my arm was killing me by the time I finished fifteen minutes ahead of everyone else. Thank god there wasn't anymore tests after that, I swear I never ever want to see a Macbeth SATs question ever again. At the moment I'm sitting here, checking up on the latest Darius news and reading a fanfiction. Its called Elemental Genesis by  urlLink Raven Dragonclaw , its a bloody tastic fanfiction and I totally recommend you read it. Well, I must be off - gotta ring Katie about her bottle of vodka which needs drinking and I must celebrate on SATs completion!

       Posted May 4th   OMG! I just had the worst day ever! I'm sitting here, my right hip throbbing in pain, I'm finding it a little hard to walk with the pain; me feeling tired out and one of my fingers was nearly chopped off due to a hungry letterbox.  The day started out okay, went to school, worried about SATs etc. My mum took great joy in chucking away my school trews so I had to wear a skirt to school this morning, and it was freggin' cold in the rain! First we had double maths upstairs before we went down to do our first science paper - the lesson went okay because we just did revision all the while. Then on the way down the stairs with my set group I somehow (I think I fainted or something) tumbled down the stairs, hitting my hip really badly and well...the spectators really got a good veiw...   *que death by embaressment*. OMG, my maths teacher! *the shame* He asked me if I was okay and everything... but I have this natural reaction to just giggle whenever I fall over. So, I was sitting there in hysterics while my friends pretended they didn't know me - gosh it was funny. The test went well while I sat, talked to myself (as one does during a science test) and did the paper. F.O.G came and I had no patience left with these girls who needed a friend problem sorted out, so I did what I'd never thought I'd do, handed them a sensible soloution, they didn't respond and just spoke back kinda rudely to me; so I handed the problem over to another Fog leader.  I was too busy hearing about Nick's escapades during SATs in year 6  (I feel deeply sorry for Tom now *shakes head*) until lunch finished. The rest of the day was fine until I got home. And there *que scarey music* was my huge pile of papers to deliver. Not all of what I wanted to deliver today would fit in my bag, I'm having a little trouble crouching down anyway so I couldn't carry 'em all. I was forced to do the smaller of my round today!  Wait more evil bad luck to come you see. While delivering my first paper, my finger got attacked by a letterbox (I don't think its owners had fed it in a while) so I had blood going all over my fingers and the papers. It still hurts now...

      And it gets worse...   Tonks is giving special lessons to the trio during the summer before 6th year. She gets more than she bargained for when sparks fly between her and Harry. Warning! This is HarryTonks! Avoid if this ship is unappealing to you.

      Now there's a lot to explain as of late. I was completely stupid not to mention that I was PoA on Monday - it was fantastic! Really I enjoyed it so much.  Now I've was so bored and fed up that school was going to start today, it is SO hot! Had to get to school in my skirt again - damn good chioce though, I was nearly melting! Today was okay, not too bad and all. I'm going to wait for My Ugly to bring my leaflets, shout at him if he's late again then more than likely go to bed, I'm knackered.  Just read the tiple chapter update of tE-NN which I've been following for over a year now. Yay! Lily's finally gonna have her baby. I wander how she reacts... can't wait.

      About the Dan and Emma holding hands thing at the Harry Potter premier.  Ain't it sweet? But dear I can see those mobs of screaming fangirls storming the streets *whimper*. I reckon they'll be an all-out war later on. The H&Hr shippers will be out from their backstreets slinging about their weapons of fanfiction destruction and shouting - "We told you they were meant for eachother." Can't you just feel the avatars storming the shipper sites already?  Then they'll be Dan's fangirls screaming their heads off like banshees, I doubt one of them has an ounce of common sense to realise and not be insanely jealous. I bet within several hours there have been almost a triple creation rate of Emma hate sites, I can just take a wild guess now over who has created them. They'll starting underground breatheasies next. There they'll all be sitting in their circles, whimpering their little sob stories, "Oh, I was normal once then Dan entered my life,"  que sighs from the other girls  " then that Emma butted in and stole him from me!(us)"  "hear, hear!" they shout as together they gather vicious vudoo dolls and torture, maybe burn them.   Lol, gosh I need to get out more.
