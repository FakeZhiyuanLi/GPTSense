      I met this guy online about 2 months ago, we'll call him "M", and after a night of chatting online he drove over to my house at like midnight and we talked on my porch for a couple of hours then made-out in a very simple, little way, it was nice though, and he was milk-fed Big Blond Boy.&nbsp; Niiice.&nbsp; Making lots of promises about calling me blah-blah-blah.  He never did.  Until today, when I get an email from him.&nbsp; We chat online again.&nbsp; Now he wants to see me Saturday.  Prediction:&nbsp; I'll never hear from him again.  Which is aok, as right NOW I am so into UKBIII.&nbsp; Ain't $4 aint' that bad either.  I love you craig's list - hear me?&nbsp; I love you!

      it is a slow week on the old posting boards, and, also, a slow week in the old dating world. i'm not in the drivers seat this week. i'm in the back of the bus, slouching, bad posture, got my mp3 player tight in the ear, RHCP alternating beats, i'm watching the clouds go by and i don't much care at which stop i get off at as i have no destination today. i'm definately in the slow lane, and it is a good place to be at the moment. i even had correct change for the driver. everyone was pleased.

      In human years I am 34 (but look a decade younger - no really!);&nbsp; in dating years I'm about, oh, 23.&nbsp; The past month I have aged 2 years.&nbsp; I realize this now.&nbsp; I'm just a babe in the cold, hard wildnerness that is dating.&nbsp; Now RD, RD is 39, but looks 25, in dating years he's about...78.  And yes I know he's only 36.&nbsp; I think.&nbsp; I could be wrong.&nbsp; I probably am.

      Some hot shot!&nbsp; He's got all the ancient chinese secrets.&nbsp; He lets out a little here, a little there.&nbsp; He's got a take on nearly everything.&nbsp; He's mysterioso and knows it.&nbsp; He drives the girls crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mortar ain't stone, eventually it just crumbles away.&nbsp; Little by little.&nbsp; Piece by piece.&nbsp; Then you can breath again.

      really, JO (and, no, not Jo, from 'the facts of life', and no not JO, as in 'men on men action', circle action, loving you youre out of range kind of JO) - no, this 'jo', is the real deal and needs a serious phoenix to rise from her ashes. and really this is the only kind of reborn that will do thank you very much. it is like the log on the fire... it takes a while to heat up, it gets to know you, gets under your skin, pretty soon you are speaking in tongues, inventing a new language, a true UKB-IIV type of experience. well, someones bound to get thier feelings hurt. i just it hope it aint me; i sure hope this mortar holds. the guy at the corner hardware store told me it was the best. the best.

      Don't keep sending winks or emails to a person that DOESN'T ANSWER YOU EVER.  This one guy on N***** just sent me ANOTHER email, although I've never answered one, and this is going back to MARCH.&nbsp; It's creepy.&nbsp; He keeps leaving me his home and work numbers.  Doesn't he KNOW??&nbsp; Can't he understand:&nbsp; I.&nbsp; Am.&nbsp; Not.&nbsp; Interested.&nbsp; Not now.&nbsp; Not ever.  He's older too, you think he'd understand about things like this.

      RD has sworn off dating, for now.&nbsp; He does that often, but he always goes back to the cheap thrills and easy lays that are:&nbsp; online dating.&nbsp; He's a guy, he's allowed AND he doesn't get all a-flutter about it, like the ladies do.  So's, I got this new UKB, I will say he's got the nicest voice out of all 3, but - what does that mean?&nbsp;   And here's the question:&nbsp; why do I like UKB's so much?&nbsp; Because it's safe, we can chat online or on the phone and THAT'S IT.&nbsp; When you do that with a local boy, you HAVE TO MEET, and meet soon, because really you don't want to be wasting time emailing to a person that you don't like, or that doesn't like you.&nbsp; I used to live by this rule, but not so much anymore.&nbsp; I need a long time to warm up and feel comfortable, I want that extra dialog and time and flirting.  What the hell - it's all a crapshoot anyways, meeting someone here or there, it doesn't really matter.&nbsp; Maybe I need DATE PATROL.

      &nbsp;Your online date has a business care?&nbsp; Don't EVER ACCEPT THE BUSINESS CARD.&nbsp; Not ever.&nbsp; It only portends no communication after the initial date.&nbsp; I'm telling you.&nbsp; I've taken 3 cards during my dating times, and each time I've never heard back from them and maybe I WANTED TO HEAR BACK FROM THEM.  And then, later on, you'll be digging through the purse, or checking the pockets of a jacket, and out will drop the business card, and you'll look at it aghast!&nbsp; Memories coming through!&nbsp; Yech.  Therefore, I never take the card.&nbsp; Never.  Plus - what kind of tool gives out his business card on a DATE?

      kiddies... ..cause you will just get a face full of muck, and you will end up cleaning the dishes. the only way to avoid the downside is to have no expectations. and hey, then, a gritty bowl of deep earth dirt can taste like a cold, frosty bowl of sugary sweet ice cream. it is all true; i swear. the next drink is on me.

      Because he never posts I'm going to relay a little dittie (and if I should get some facts wrong - tough RD, maybe you should post more!!): &nbsp; Last year RD went out on one date with a girl, a nurse as I recall, a nice girl.&nbsp; However, after one date RD noticed she had removed her ad, with a profile message that stated something along the lines that she had met someone and felt it proper to remove her name from the online dating stall.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Now both of us thought that was little off-putting, RD's pretty cute and all, but ONE lousy date?&nbsp;It was weird.&nbsp; Fast forward to Monday, yesterday, and RD found out in a roundabout way, that this girl is now buying property with her new boyfriend!&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; This is the instant intimacy type of thing fostered by online dating.&nbsp; The pressure for some spark, some potential, something INSTANT to happen is overwhelming, to be bf/gf RIGHT THEN, to fall in love NOW. &nbsp; It allows seemingly perfectly nice, smart females to buy property with a new boyfriend a mere 7-8 months after being ready to chuck it all for a stranger.&nbsp; RD escaped - AGAIN!

      Date last night.&nbsp; Round my house.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; He was a braggart and arrogant in a way I don't like.&nbsp; His shirt was unbuttoned too far.&nbsp; He did have a nice, hairy chest.&nbsp; I was very proud of myself in that:&nbsp; I cut it short.&nbsp; So I was home before 9pm.&nbsp; I don't know, you meet people, you unmeet people....what can you do?&nbsp; As I walked home last night, I looked again all around me and thought - is this futile?&nbsp; Should I stop?&nbsp;&nbsp; But I won't, because atleast I'm working towards a goal (getting myself a boyfriend), one plodding step at a time, plus it's kind of cool asking yourself:&nbsp; JacksOne, who will you meet this month?&nbsp; Plus, I'm not that starry-eyed about romance anymore, a sign of maturity?&nbsp; Or a heart turning to STONE?&nbsp; Which is it? &nbsp; And I also ask:&nbsp; if one is not optimistic BEFORE the date, are you dooming the date to failure?&nbsp; If you're like:&nbsp; I don't want to do this, I don't want to do this....are you setting yourself up for disappointment - no matter what?&nbsp; I wonder, I wa-wa-wa-wa-wonder.

      I have recently finished my study of pictures vs. no pictures.&nbsp; On my recent ads I stated clearly:&nbsp; send me your picture.&nbsp; I decided to write the guys that DID NOT&nbsp;send photo's, and all except 3 were&nbsp;not very attractive.... &nbsp;  Listen, one might feel all noble and above-it-all by not posting a photo, or sending one.&nbsp; Like you're so stunning that you won't post a picture, because you're so into real, substantive things (unlike a cute face), but really, you're just being a hypocrite.&nbsp; Because all those picture-less beauties ain't answering picture-less ads, no they're answering the ads featuring cute guys.  &nbsp;  So what I am saying:&nbsp; pictures are good.&nbsp; Play by the rules.&nbsp; Purty es as purty duz.

      It's like my Mammy always said:&nbsp; Careful what you wish for JacksOne, you just might get it. &nbsp; It started off innocent enough, me just wanting a new UKB, that's all, because I love those British/Scottish boys.&nbsp; So I place an ad on Thursday, and since I have received:&nbsp; 123 REPLIES. &nbsp; I cannot keep up!&nbsp; I can't!&nbsp; And don't make me go on about my local ad, oh no don't....because I can't.&nbsp; Oh lordie, what the hell?&nbsp; Now I feel all responsible to answer back, but one must remember the first rule:&nbsp; it's the IMPERSONAL ads;&nbsp; there ain't no guarantee you'll get a reply.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I will answer to a special few, and from those we'll see who will make the cut and become UKBIII, and I don't need to tell you how marvelous that can be....

      My lips are moving but no sounds coming out The words are audible but i have my doubts That you realise what has been said  You look at me as if you're in a daze It's like the feeling at the end of the page when you realize You don't know what you just read.  What are words for When no one listens anymore What are words for When no one listens what are words for When no one listens There's no use talking at all.

      You have to figure out what kind of movie person you are.&nbsp; For instance, I'm not a "Shrek" kinda girl, and if you're a "Shrek" kinda guy, we ain't gonna see eye-to-eye on much.&nbsp; That is a fact.&nbsp;

      We'll call him:&nbsp; FB.&nbsp; So we went and had sushi.&nbsp; It was good.&nbsp; He's very into motorcycles and proceeded to get WAY TOO TECHNICAL with me, engine sizes, model numbers etc.&nbsp; I knew he was nervous but it was annoying and was grating on my nerves.&nbsp; He said he was 5'll, more like 5'8, because I had 1/2 heels on and I was taller. &nbsp; I found my mind wandering off during our dinner, off to that special memory place that contains the UKBII and all the nasty, wonderful things we did.&nbsp; Then I'd SNAP BACK and nod and smile.&nbsp; Really I was so bored, we were totally unalike in every way. &nbsp; He's called me twice so far, and I'm not going to return them.

      Look, I'm an old woman, and during my vast time on earth have managed to accumulate some material goods:&nbsp; a nice house (I own), a nice car, nice things.&nbsp; Not over-the-top GRAND types of things, but nice, solid type of things.&nbsp; How was I able to do this?&nbsp; By working and saving and being the tiniest bit responsible. &nbsp; Therefore, I want to date guys that have managed to accumulate these things as well.&nbsp; Why would I want to date a 40 year-old man still living in an apartment and driving a crappy car?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Are we equals?&nbsp; No, we are not.&nbsp; I mean - what has he been up to the last 15 years? &nbsp; I want a guy that gets up in the morning, takes a shower and goes to work.&nbsp; Like me.&nbsp; I want a guy that sometimes goes out on the weekend and ties one on, other weekends he stays home and relaxes.&nbsp; Like me.&nbsp; I want a guy that pays his bills and can afford cable tv and a land line.&nbsp; Like me.

      It was this one guy, he wrote great emails, his one picture didn't seem that bad, he was smart and political.&nbsp; I agreed to meet him for drinks. &nbsp; He was one of the ugliest guys I have ever seen.&nbsp; His mouth and teeth made my stomach roll.&nbsp; He had tattoos on his FINGERS and forearms and yech.&nbsp; He smoked.&nbsp; He was really so, so ugly.&nbsp; Plus, he repaired copy machines.&nbsp; Which will bring me to my next post. &nbsp; I was able to leave gracefully about an hour into it.&nbsp; This guy proceeded to call me 6-7 times per night for about two weeks.&nbsp; I never answered, he never left a message, but I have caller ID.

      i like good emails, for instance JackOne's emails are eloquent and quite articulate, and while not always life affirming or overly-positive, they are usually full of good humour and the ocassional fudge-sicle, nutty buddy and or the tasty like...  now, the chances of that same great email person being your soul mate, you never know, but like most things in life, the odds are usually not in your favor... with that in mind, i've had bad emailers be good kissers and good emailers be good kissers and viceee versee -  i wonder what is for lunch, my belly id grumbling.....

      All he has to do is ACCEPT THE INVITE sent to his email address from blogger than he'll be welcomed to online blogging world!  Anonymous said...  here is a post again by me, nameless, anonymous poster cause i do not have a username yet, like on the dating scene, is the equivalent of a blind date, no photo, take a chance for chrissake, will you? i have had three blind dates over the yers, no photo at all. why would i do this you may wonder, well besides my inherrant mental instability, there is no clear cut answer. now, two of these dates were ok, but they were not lookers by any strech, one was a real looker and we talked for a few months, she was quite attractive and funny, but, she was a serious insominac and slept 2-3 hours a night... and it was hard to get things going, i never even got any nookie, and i wanted the nookie on that one. but i was denied! deined the nookie. life is like that sometimes.... Richard Pryor once said in one of his acts, it is all about the ppuuu-sssss---eeeeeeeyyy, now, when he said that and the way he said that, it was very funny... not un-funny like i just said it. but we all know about his myriad dates/marriages, etc, etc - so he may have been on to something. i don't know, youd' have to ask him.

      I mean, good emails means you're working with someone with a brain.  So you always know that.  However, sometimes the good emailers don't have great social skills.  Or they're not as funny in real life.  I myself am as funny and witty and interesting as you all suspect!  Whatevah.

      I do not remember.  However, my third date....he wrote really great emails.  That would be because he was a published poet and professor at a major university here in town.  So's we talk on the phone for SIX HOURS the first time.  Then afterwards very long, long talks.  He was interesting.  I liked him. We agreed to meet.  He's not cute, at all.  Nice mouth and teeth.  Good conversation, very flirty and fun. He compliments me on my shoes (good!), on my nails (good!), on my jewelry (very good!).    We went out on a couple of dates.  He became very weird and moody.  Then he writes me this email that says he's just not attracted to me - and he doesn't understand why? (well neither do I as his mentioning of my looks every 30 minutes began to grate, and now I'm not cute enough or something??).  I said ok, I mean what else could I say?  A couple of months later he calls me up and begs to see me, to take me out, so he comes over to my house....we fooled around a little....then he left.  Forever.  I don't want to deal with mooody creative men for a while.  On to four!!

      With a nice Jewish boy.  I love Jewish boys, they're smart and funny and super clean and treat you well, like you have a BRAIN and THOUGHTS and they're very interested!  But this one, he wasn't like that at all.  Firstly I met him at his house, we were going to walk to a restaurant.  I walk up to the door, I knock.  He begins to speak to me, not opening the door, not asking me to come in.  Then I see him:  dirty wrinkled tshirt, old jeans, crappy shoes and NOT athletic and toned.  Goofy and obnoxious.  Out of breath from walking to the restaurant.  Dropped hints all through out dinner about seeing me again.  Made a big to-do about at $25.00 dinner bill, asked me if I had money to pay half (uh no - you asked ME out for DINNER).  I don't mind stocky boys, or big boys, or boys with a belly, I do mind when you lie.  I do mind when you can't wear a CLEAN tshirt.  I do mind snarky comments about the bill.   Suffice to say:  that was it.  I never spoke to him again, but I recently came across his ad and he's still lying.

      I was lonely.  It seemed right at the time.  It was fun and easy and, according to commercials, there were literally hundreds of nice-looking, clean-white-toothy-grin males just waiting, waiting for me!!  I'll also say at that time I hadn't dated for, ummm, let's see here....14 years. The old "high school boyfriend" thing that went on way - way too long.  So I was green behind the ears, a little babe in arms when it came to the cold hard personal ad world.  A world that JacksTwo aptly named: Impersonal Ads.

      Because I'm in love. Because I'm going to get married. In December. Of THIS YEAR. To UKBIII, and he is far and away the best guy I've ever met EVER. He is a much better person than I - he will stop and administer AID TO THE STRICKEN, while I'll drive by and bitch about the lookie-lou's. You see? He makes me BETTER, and I'll knock him down to reality once in a while.  He's everything I ever wanted in a guy, including being 6'2 and very .... uh.... other things. He fixes stuff, plays the guitar and loves QOTSA. What more could a girl ask for? How about home ownership? Got it! How about parachuter-type-male? Got it! How about sweet and sensitive? Got it! How about head over heels for ME? Got it!!  So you see, the internet can work wonders. Of course, it may take up to two years, but STILL.  And good old RD, armed with one cute-as-hell picture and a changed attitude, is once again taking the plunge, he's a gonna get hisself a woman! And he can, with the right attitude, one that scoffs at the disappearance, he'll be WELL on his way to his wife and 2.5 kids. And someday, real soon I think, he's actually GOING TO POST HIS ADVENTURES HERE ON THIS BLOG.  Thank you. The End.

      Is pretty funny, especially the post giving online dating tips, which are all pretty good, until you get to the:  "Don't send me pictures of your penis! Penis's are ugly and women don't like looking at them!"  Huh?  What's this crazy bitches problemo?  I happen to LOVE looking at pictures of nekkid penis, very much so.  In fact, I received a couple of penis pictures from CL and, although not my taste (I don't want to see the penis peeking out of see-thru girly-type underwear, I like it looking all masculine and erect), they were certainly amusing.  This girl knows not of what she speaks, and supposedly she's all open and free, blowjob-beneath-the-desk kind of girl.  But you can't get the penis pix off of legitimate dating sites, oh no, you've got to do the CL thingie.  Or maybe Lava.  I'll have you know in my Lava days it was not uncommon to receive 2-3 naked penis pics A DAY.  Ahh, the internet.  Because baby, you may send me all the penis pics you want, but you ain't never gonna get a picture back of me.  That's the way the cookie crumbles online.

      And RD really should, because he's like the old sage of dating, he's seen it all, had every weirdo chickie you can imagine. They fall fast and hard for RD, and he knows it.  This is why: he's a hottie and smart and he knows how to work the "oh I'm so innocent and lonely and need a woman to take care of me" thing, which girls just EAT UP. Then he helps them get them drunk and makes his smooth move, because can you really resist a guy that says "do you know how much I want to kiss you" No, you can't, especially a cute one that smells good. He claims he's a good kisser, I have no reason to doubt him. Then he takes out the magic wand and they're in AWE, shock & awe. Then he leaves. Like Windsong, he stays on their mind.  Ahh yeah, RD knows how to work it, put his name down flip it and reverse it.   He's Dr. Onlinedating, and I needed my session last night!  Whew boy did I EVER.

      This guy keeps answering my profile, sending me T.S. Eliot poems, and I think it's very cool, but I don't want to talk to anyone right now because I'm so into UKBIII.  Altho I will say I'm getting some very nice honey-ees answering my Craig's List ad, VERY nice. Some cute greek guy with blue eyes and a Josh Homme watch. Sigh. What's a girl to do? You know what they say about Greek boys....!!

      "M", the guy I wrote about. Here goes: ok, I'm online chatting with UKBIII (he is becoming my most favorite EVER but I digress) and M starts trying to chat, and he won't stop and I won't answer, but I'm reading the crazy-ass shit he's writing, like: "grr - you're making me mad JacksOne" or "I really really want to see you tonight!" and "come on and talk to me!" and, the greatest: "I'm coming over to see you, I'll be at your house in 45 minutes, k?"  What the fuck? What the fuck is this assholes problem? Right then I knew, man this has gone TOO FAR, when these knuckleheads can CALL me or COME TO MY HOUSE. Granted, that was my fault and in the future I'll be more cautious, but please, what an asshole.    Then he sends me this sweet email in the morning, apologizing for acting crazy, asking me if I wanted to go to a Bronco game with him and yada-yada-yada.  I've taken RD's advice: no contact, no contact, no contact and no reply no matter what.  There is, of course, a sexual kink involved here too, M really, really wants to be reamed up the old, well you know, by some gorgeous gal. It won't be me!! Altho I can admit I find the thought highly erotic.
