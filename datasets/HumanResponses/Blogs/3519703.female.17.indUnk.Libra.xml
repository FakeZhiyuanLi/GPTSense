      Well, im in the second half of 13 days in a row of work..im soooo exhausted. I wish mah 'rents were millionares and i'd never hafta to work a day in my life. BP's not that bad....i do less work than i did at hard-on's and get paid more. its great lol. For some reason im like obsessed w/ britney spears new song....its really depressing for some reason but i like it. It makes me feel like almost in love, but my hearts breaking...its kind of hard to explain.  I wanna b in love again...i've almost forgot how it feels..:-/..but everytime i think i might b, something goes wrong. I feel so empty...mayb the right guy will come along SOON, but i dont want to rush into anything because i might think somethings there thas not...i guess we'll find out. Well i gotta get some sleep so i can work a million more days and live through it...nitez

Well..it sucked worse. The only good thing about it was that i got to see Sean. I haven't talked to him in FOREVER. He's lookin good :D. I got to see bobby too but that wasn't till the end of the night. It was like i didnt get to see anyone that i really WANTED to talk to till the last 10 min. of it. Some girls got into a fight at the end and the one was knocked unconscious...that hadda call the ambulance and everything..i hope she's ok. then after that someone else got in a fight and they hadda shut the place down..jus as it was gett'n good >:o. After that then we went to julez and drank...nothing real exciting happened there..except georgie has this huge eff'n nemo...its 7ft long. i loved it *hehe*...i sat on that thing like all night. it was mah drinkin buddy. Then Brooke started gett'n trashed and clothes started coming off so i went to bed. And now here i am..still f'n tired..so ill ttya'll kool kids lataz.

Meg wasn't here tho....she started crying and said she couldn't handle being w/ everyone and then dad pulled in the alley and she left....w/ no explanation...really weird and im pissed. NEWAY, i still had fun..there was a lot of ppl that came. There was like a gizzlion and one babies here..I LOVED IT *hehe*...i cant wait to have babies...well ok..yeah i can wait..but it'll b fun. I know there alot of work but jus knowing that the little life that i hold in my hands is a product of me and the love of my lifes is jus so cool. and i hope i can b half the mom to my babies as my mom has been to me.

Well, eric called me 2nite...and it was kinda funny cuz i was jus thinking about him when he called..but i didnt have service so i jus got the voice message. I also got another message from a particular someone. I've been talkin to him alot lately (even tho i swore to mahself that i never would again). I dont think we could get bak together tho...at least not for a very long time...ive been lied to too much and mah heart still hasn't heald from the last time and i at least wanna have scars before i have it ripped to pieces again. It's jus that we always fight like cats and dogs and then the next second we're madly in love...it kind of reminds me of an episode of Rosanne where they go to las vegas w/ arnie and nancy. o well mayb someday things will change...  yeah...i almost forgot..tomoras the big day..graduation. Im ready for it. well, mayb physically but not emotionally..at least not yet. W/ each passing day it gets easier..im jus preparing mahself for the big cryingfest tomora and the terrific summer comingup. other than the going to clear to cresson everyday for ONE 4hour class, it should b fun. I can handle this whole being grownup thing, Im a big girl now (da-duh). I got mah whole life ahead of me and im gonna grab it by the neck and In the words of julez "rock this shit" ...now im not saying lifes gonna b a big party, but GDmit imma have fun! I only got one life to live and im gonna live it up.  OH YEAH i almost forgot..the Sr. picnic was today. So FUN! i dont think one person left dry...good times guyz! and the whole keg thing...priceles..*its ginger ale..swear* and i got a pic of mr. hinish tapping it...def a good time. immma miss all of ya so much!!  well gota go find some ppl to tear the skool up w/ *hehe* luviez*

      well, today was my last day of classes, my last day to yell at random kids while walking down the hall, my last day to make fun of mr. brambley and mr. baker to their faces , and i hafta say i think im actually gonna miss things in high school. People keep asking me if im reading to graduate...and i dont know how to anwser that. Im ready to be an adult, to be independent...at least i think i am. but then theres a part of me that doesn't wanna have a job, that doesn't wana leave home (or this crappy lil town), that still wants to be wild and crazy. Im going to college so i can stil b a little crazy..jus a little bit more responsible now. Yeah....17 yrs old...and $20,000 in debt..i betta b getting responsible fast..do they have pills for that? ..."Take Responsibilitionaty (sounds medical), it'll give ya a kick in the ass, punk". Well neway, i think im gonna try to get sum sleep, or at least go chill w/ the fam.....i got the sr. breakfast tomora and then grad. practice all day..WOOHOO...  Night ya'l
