      Everyone needs their Beauty Sleep; even ugly people (it just doesn't work for them so well). Party Animals need their sleep too, no matter how much Red Bull you have. So when I’m rudely awoken tonight by a phone call from a certain sexy Italian chick, I’m a little P’d off. Well, not really. I don’t seem to get P’d off at anything these days anymore; not since the Prozac kicked in a couple of years ago. It’s like… wow… yeah man… peace, groove ‘ay! :)  I obviously made the mistake of not checking the caller id in the first place; answering too quickly for my liking and general rules of the game in the second; and answering the call at all in the third.  So, she’s just finished her night out with her girlfriend and wanted some excitement for the evening. Maybe she just didn’t pull and obviously thought ‘oh I know I’ll call NK’ he’s guaranteed to be out partying somewhere and maybe I’ll get a good night kiss at the end of it after all’. Well, NOT THIS TIME SISTER! The shagmiester’s shop is closed for business tonight.    RULE 74:  Never play by the dreg’s rules. Self-respect dictates that you never put out when they feel like it, but when you do. They can’t just call you up willy-nilly and expect you to service them at the drop of a hat. You must call the shots at all times. –  Mr P    Time Out!

      I figured that it was highly likely that the two Turkish regulars would be in Tiger Tiger tonight. It was Friday after all, Eddie would be playing and it just felt right. Maybe tonight would be the opportunity to pursue something with the dark haired one and test the water.  After a quick vodka and coke at a bar near the office I got into Tiger Tiger around 8:30pm. NK was on his way but not due to arrive for an hour or so. As I walked in I passed the very lovely Swedish girl that I met two years ago. She used to work for the security company and looked like Anna Kournikova. I'd seen her briefly twice before but she gave me a nice welcoming smile as she recognised me, even though I'd changed in the last two years from having short white spiky hair to have almost no hair. After leaving my jacket in the cloakroom, saying "Hi" to the bathroom attendant I decided to head back to see her and have a chat. She caught me as I got to the top of the stairs as she was on her way for a cigarette break. We had a little hug and promised to meet up after her break.  At the end of the bar, I got a drink and started sipping it, biding by time. I then had one of the old school regulars come up to me. He's a bodyguard for the Swedish ambassador and really nice guy. I'd met him one night whilst doing a Samaritan act on a poor, drunked girl and ended up propping up her head whilst calling for an ambulance. She was comatose due to alcohol and being in that state in Central London is not a good idea for a young girl by herself.  After a brief catchup chat, discussing the decline of Tiger Tiger over the years he left and I moved to talk to the Swedish girl. As soon as I arrived, she disappeared and I was left chatting to the restaurant hostess, very nice, stunning Italian brunette and a very pleasant person to chat to and look at. Eventually NK arrived and I left the Italian and Swede although the Swede was going home anyhow. However, she did tell me that I should talk to her soon and that she's there all the time, except tomorrow when she'll be out partying.  I headed down to the club, said "Hi" to Eddie and sure enough, the Turkish girls were here so I went outside to greet them and then proceeded to spend the next 5 hours with them. Mostly dancing but some drinking, some chatting, including touchy feely stuff with the beautiful dark haired one. She told me that she was 20 but that the age gap didn't bother her, it was all about mental perception and state of mind. Good answer. We arranged to meet up tomorrow as she was going shopping in Wimbledon and we'd spend some time together. Eddie had also offered to take me home after dropping the girls off so we were set. Eddie wanted the blonde, I wanted the brunette, perfect.  Towards the end of the night, inside the dregs hour, a very persistent guy came up to my girl and tried incessantly to pull her. In the end, I decided to back off and see what happened. With 10 feet between us, she was happy to dance with him although she twice removed his hands from her waist. I thought she must be sound after all. As I then moved further away and turned away, I'm sure I caught him pecking her on the lips so I figured it was perhaps time to feign a trip to the toilet. So I left the dancefloor and walked to the back where the toilets are. I then walked around the perimeter to the end of the bar. From this vantage point I could watch them both but she'd find it difficult to see me, particularly as I was in the opposite direction from where she'd expet me to be. And I stood there watching. If I also looked beyond her, I could see her blonde friend sat on the sofa behind, I'm just not sure if she was watching me watching her friend.  Anyhow, a bit of hand holding led to more intimacy and eventually a kiss so I decided at 2:52am it was time to leave. I got my jacket, didn't say goodbye and left the club. I let NK know I was outside but stayed there and watched Eddie leave, followed by the blonde, followed by the dark haired girl dragging the hand of her pull behind her. Scratch another one of the list.

       I’M A DREG!  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaghhh !   I have no idea how it happened. Who, what, where, when, why… Never mind the world wide web www, I’ve got more double-ewes going round my head right now than Popeye after being beaten round the head with a steaming locomotive by Brutus!  It’s a Thursday night… A major night on the Dregs weekly calendar. It started off innocently enough*… I’m gonna skip the bits that Mr P has already put in his entry. Anyway from what I remember my entry for last night will mostly be very short.  *I know it’s uncanny how Mr P started his bit using the same line.  When we got to TT, I headed for my favourite babe behind the bar. I think it would be a good idea to mention the amount of alcohol we consumed last night so I’ll give you a running commentary up to the point my memory did that thing you get on old fashioned TV’s; the sort of shrinking into a dot that seems to eventually disappear with an audible pop. From that point on I’m afraid it’s as blank as a very clean A4 sheet of white paper. So Mr P can tell me whatever he likes and I will have to believe him as he’s the only person, outside of me, who can possibly write on said sheet the events of last… whatever! I also have to point out that I’m aided in this by a certain amount of evidence; I will of course argue that said evidence is purely circumstantial.  So like I said I approached the bar, kissed M and C and said hello to G. In fact a friend of mine recently noted that as far as I am concerned in TT, it might as well be called Cheers. As regulars in TT, you could say that Mr P and I enjoy a certain amount of preferential treatment from the staff who, on the whole, have sort of become our friends. The sort of ‘Kudos’ we seem to have earned (and trust me you have to earn it, or at least pay a hell of a lot for it) is a great source of amusement for us when we can show it off. When you walk up to the door and see the queue stretch round the corner for about 100 meters (d’ya like that bit? You know? The metric bit. In accordance with EU standards). Then you stroll along the queue eying up every good looking female that happens to be standing there in very little clothing and trying not shiver despite the fact that she can no longer be said to be hiding peanuts but a couple of long range cruise missiles (that’s where Saddam hid his wmd’s, by the way) due to the cold. Then you select the most likely one(s) to be grateful and escort them to the door where you are welcomed with a smile and a handshake* by the bouncers while they hold the door open for you and the queue of wannabes that are suddenly vying for your blood.  You swoon the said lady(s) over to the bar shaking hands with bouncers, managers and even the odd glass collector. You even wave to the DJ, and he actually waves back. When you get to the bar, you get the immediate attention of not just the nearest barmaid but all the others come over and either kiss you, hug you or firmly shake your hand (in the case of barmen – one or two do sometimes do the continental thing). You ask for your favourite drink and they will serve it up for you just the way you like it. They even know what you’re gonna ask for anyway. Then you should have by this time, if you’re any good, figured out what the lady(s) like to drink. Believe me, it’s a knack, but with practice you can always tell who drinks what and just how they like it. So you suggest the perfect drink for the lady(s); do not buy any. Certainly not the first time round. Try and confirm your hand first, unless both you and they are highly inebriated and the chances of getting off with each other is very high ‘cause she’s the last dreg in the joint.  * Note:  The handshake is a symbolic way of you symbolically checking in and leaving your saneness and reality at the door.   “Inside Tiger Tiger is not connected to the same time and space as the rest of the world; its reality is completely warped” -  Mr P    I digress; back to last night. Once at the bar, I ordered 2 double Vodka-Cranberries (VC), a Double Vodka-Red Bull(VRB) and a Dry White Wine(DWW). One of the VC’s is for me and the VRB for Mr P. The Second VC and the DWW were for a couple of girls I’d met about twice before.  The first time was at the Tiger bar when one of them, let’s just call her Miss A, had bumped into me (Tiger Bar is usually so crowded I’m surprised there aren’t more cases of DNA analysis and paternity lawsuits in front of the CSA). She and her friend, Miss S, were very cheery and in a happy mood. Being my good-natured jovial self, I asked them what they were celebrating and they said that they’d just graduated. I congratulated them and left. But I have this uncanny memory for faces (I actually also have a type of photographic memory). So when about a week later as I was walking through TT, I walked past them and instantly shouted “The Graduates” waving and generally saying hello and asking how they must be on one hell of a long, extended, celebration. The third, and hopefully last, time was last night where I saw them sat at one of the low tables on the ground floor, said hello (in my usual charming way) and asked what they were drinking. That was mistaken to mean I was offering them a drink. In fact I was genuinely curious about what they were drinking. Anyway, more about the Graduates later as they do have a fairly important part to play in last night’s unfortunate events.  Back to the bar and a bit of chat with my absolute favourite bar maid in the whole wide world (Ok, there are a few close seconds), and I order a double shot of Tequila neat in a tumbler. Tequila Gold, it has to be Gold. I must admit that I have developed a certain taste for the stuff and enjoy simply sipping it luxuriating in the warmth of its consequence. I have gone past the adolescent days of downing Tequila shots in one in a tacky pseudo-salsa clubs.  Usually bought off a, half naked, pretty bird with bacteria ridden glasses slung across her torso – ammunition style – with cheap, over-priced, watered-down Tequila slung across her not-so-child-bearing hips like a modern day gun slinging cowgirl. If you go out anywhere these days you will see these groups of young (twenty-something) guys with the obligatory white shirt, worn out, and their gelled hair-dos all doing that sort of thing. I suppose the general idea is to impress their even more, zit-popping, adolescent chums with their, I’ll-drink-you-under-the-table, skills and bravado. Of course they’re always hoping, beyond hope, that their one pound fifty tip will land them in bed with the vision of beauty smiling seductively at them as she refills their glass for the fourth time. Her glassy-eyed smile is usually to conceal her thinking: ‘drink up you slimy, good-for-nothing, lousy tipping, loser so that you will fall over and I won’t have to worry about you trying to even shag a fly tonight’. You’ll notice how these young males turn their heads away from their mates as they grimace in sour-tasting, throat-burning, stomach-churning pain. Their mental anguish is made worse by the nauseating taste of the salt they’ve just licked off their unwashed hand (after going to the loo five minutes earlier and accidentally getting some splash-back off the urinal). This is mixed with the sour taste of the lime they’re biting on much like soldiers used to bite the bullet to stave off the pain of an amputation. You get the general picture right?  Once again, I digress some more. So far I’ve had 1 double Vodka and a Double Tequila Gold. After that we have a couple of B52’s (Kahlua, Bailey's, and Grand Marnier). I must at this juncture point out that I’d already had 2 bottles of that Czech Bud beer and Mr P had 2 Orange Bacardi Breezers in the Cove at Covent Garden. Most average males would start feeling woozy at this point, but oh no…  Mini turns up with another one of her friends. We order Caipirinha (Cap-i-ri-nia) all-round and we’re also given some concoction that the guys behind the bar serve us for free. I’ll tell you one thing that’s a damn excellent but very strong drink. An old friend who I haven’t seen for years turns up with his girlfriend. And here’s where it all starts going downhill – I buy the first bottle of Champagne for the night.  If the Champers was my first mistake, the second was going downstairs getting hold of the Graduates and inviting them to join us for a drink. I only did it as a sort of friendly gesture and… Well I must admit that I was hoping to get in with S. That’s the problem with girls of that age. One of them is always the babysitter. Only this time the Babysitter was the one acting a bit foot-loose and fancy-free with me.  Let me put it this way, my memory starts fading rapidly round about this point. The last thing I remember was picking up a glass of champers. Unfortunately the penultimate memory is being stalked by the babysitter and snogging her face off!  Now, so far you could say, there’s nothing there to worry about. Well, apart from being stalked by the babysitter and allowing the Champagne Goggles to reduce the 19-stone Babysitter into a size 8 supermodel. As I’m writing this, I just remembered who she reminds me of: Dawn French!  Yet, all this is not as bad as waking up this morning with a throbbing headache, a large chunk of my life missing and…  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgggggggggggggghhhhhhhhh!  Who put that there? What the hell is this fat, ugly snoring cow doing in… My Bed! She doesn’t even look like Dawn French, she’s just… Aaaaaarrrrrrgggggghhhhhh!

      I got beer thrown all over me!!! Rather than be annoyed by it, I was probably more amused, especially thinking about this blog entry that I'll get to write. Overall, probably the second most entertaining night of fun, second only to the night that ended in a strip club with a woman determined to give me her own private lap dance.  It started innocently enough with a couple of drinks at The Cove in Covent Garden, overlooking the square, watching the world walk by. At around 9pm we headed off to Tiger Tiger and settled into our second home. It was pretty quiet but we moved upstairs to the Blue Bar, chatted to the bar staff and started to increase the alcoholic payload. NK started chatting to a nice young woman and I was largely left to my own devices until a female friend arrived with one of her Italian work colleagues. We had a pleasant chat, gave him a guided tour of the club and were discussing the relative merits of Rome and Florence and which was better.  We had a bit of a physical reshuffle when two other regulars arrived from downstairs, known as The Graduates and I ended up chatting to the young woman that NK had been chatting to earlier, The Ballet Dancer. She's an 18 year old South African woman that has decided to take a gap year in London, having fun, living life before going home to pursue a university degree in Fashion or Photography. For the rest of the night we just chatted non-stop, going through a whole range of topics whilst also sampling several shooter concoctions and a few double shots of vodka and malibu. Towards the end of the night NK was getting a bit clingy and ended up chatting to this large woman from Sierra Leone (I think). (Just had a text from NK asking "WTF happened? ... Why do I have a big fat snoring cow in my bed? Pls, pls, pls, no more champagne", ROFLMAO)  This rather robust lady had a very thick African accent but had an over familiar manner with me and The Ballet Dancer referring to her as her "African Sister" all the time. Anyhow, things progressed between NK and The African Shotputter and we all left at 3am and decided to get the usual Chinese in Chinatown at 1997. Myself and The Ballet Dancer had a lot in common, including our alcohol control where we both drink to a point and then no further so we were pretty sober in the restaurant and amused by the drunken shenanigans happening on their side of the table. At 4am, The Ballet Dancer left to catch a ride home with one of Tiger's bar support guys. She works in a bar and one of her life-long friends works at Tiger so she'd already arranged this ride home. I was more than happy as well as I never take a woman home from Tiger Tiger, if there's genuine interest between two people it will wait until another day, or night. Therefore, I always know that Ms Right will never go home with me, if she did she wouldn't be Ms Right. :)  The African Shotputter then wanted to know, "What's wrong with your woman? Why she leave you? I'm here with my man, why is she not?". I then proceeded to explain, "In my opinion, any woman that can be picked up in one night and taken home isn't worthwhile". Through her drunken haze she worked out I was referring to her and proceeded to have a rant and ended up throwing her bottle of beer over me!!! QED  So I paid the bill, told NK I was leaving and I waited for him. After 5 minutes, I texted him and called him without any joy so I left him. On the way home I send several texts to The Ballet Dancer updating her on the aftershow party she missed and also passing my compliments to her on her engaging conversation. We'll have to see whether her, "lets catch up next week", parting comment was meaningful or just meaningless fluff.  NK pleaded with me several times to "save him". I tried. I even thought the beer throwing and his "get out", "go away" responses would have been the perfect opportunity to escape but no, he remained. The beer googles were clearly working last night, or maybe champagne goggles are more powerful as anybody that willingly pulls somebody that looks like the woman from Tom & Jerry cartoons that shouts "Thomas!" is clearly under the influence.  I crammed my night's sleep into 90 minutes and then started to catch up with NK a few hours later. I just called him and he has a large amount of blanks in his memory. Maybe it will come back during the day but at the moment, he's desperately trying to work out how to get the shotputter out of his flat without seeing her face.

      These are the unlicensed taxi drivers that ply their business in the West End late at night and during the weekends. They're just ordinary car owners but for the price of a normal taxi they'll take you home but it's a bit of a lottery. They don't know where they're going, they're not insured and they're not professional. You may also get a decent car or a wreck.  If you're a single woman, don't even think about it. I wouldn't even think about it if there were just two women. There have been cases of these drivers raping vulnerable women so avoid it. Tiger Tiger has a licensed taxi despatcher just inside the door, use them. The price will be the same but they're insured, professional and won't endanger your life.  We call them taxi-minicab-taxi guys because when you leave Tiger Tiger, or any other West End club, at 3am, there can be up to 40 of these guys lining the exit shouting "Taxi? Minicab? Taxi?".

      Vrrrrooooommmmmmmmm!!! It's Monaco Grand prix, Domino's pizza and relaxation after a heavy Saturday night. Time to make a move and head back from South East London to East London, via the centre. Having tried the direct route and got frustrated with the connections, particularly on a Sunday afternoon, I'd come to the conclusion that it was easier to go into the centre and then back out.  NK suggests, "If you're going into the centre... you may as well drop in, it's on your way home". "OK", says I, "You better get ready then". And so another night ensues at Tiger Tiger.  Sunday night at TT, is the worst night, by a long way. The club closes at Midnight, which concentrates the evening and dregs hour into a fraction of their normal time. It's also difficult finding somewhere to go afterwards. There are only two places I know of that are open later;  urlLink Bar Rumba  and Storm, on Leicester Square. However, we tried Storm once before, it was empty, literally, tried to get our four entrance fees back and were refused. We told three others on their way in, not to bother as it was £8 each, it was empty and they'd refuse to give their money back. Needless to say, we got told to "F*$@ Off" by the security and then had one of their friends, perhaps an off-duty bouncer, follow us for 100m trying to goad us into a fight.  We had a few drinks, nothing much happening so decided to move on to Bar Rumba, found a queue, said a few well chosen words to the duty manager on the door and blagged our way straight in. 'Twas an urban night, packed as usual but not much talent in there, or maybe just not our crowd. Left early, around 1:30am and went to the usual 1997 Chinese restaurant, saw my usual taxi-minicab-taxi guy, reserved him for the trip home.  Very few women, four French women that we're clearly Gold-diggers on the pull that were feeling a little miffed that they'd played their hand so early. Two guys had moved to the table next to them and worked their way in even though we'd been getting the eye contact. When we then opted for the bottle of champagne with strawberries to speed our trip along to drunken oblivion the daggers of envy were skimming past our heads a plenty. No women of worth to speak about at Bar Rumba but kudos to the bar manager that refused to serve us a bottle of champagne, even though we offered to pay twice the price.

      Nope, not dinner options, well maybe, but things never got that far, sadly, very sadly. I know blog posts are supposed to be short and sweet but how can you squeeze 3 nights of entertainment, i.e. around 20 hours of part-ay-ing, into one short post? Impossible, in my opinion so maybe I'll have to split this into several posts, and/or get NK to help out.  As you may have guessed, I'm the other player on this team. I'm sure you'll find out in time that we're like chalk and cheese in many respects with widely differing views and opinions. However, we also see eye-to-eye on many issues and it's probably our contrasting personalities that has made our friendship so strong and such a potent team.  WftD has been a part of our lives for so long and been talked about so many times that it's actually refreshing to get this project off the ground. There is no ulterior motive, we just have had a lot of fun, had a lot of strange experiences but mostly, it's been a lot of fun and we thought we'd share. There will be insightful information, there will also be some revealing information about what really goes on in the clubs of London. Nothing too sordid but hopefully you'll get to live our lives vicariously by reading this blog. It will also help us to remember the evenings, the people we meet, the events that occur and how these nights have become a life all by themselves where we're merely passengers. Almost every night starts the same way, with no objective and no plan. It's just two blokes having fun.  Waiting for the Dregs is the game played by many guys in the London clubbing scene. The 'dregs' are the women that are a little worse for wear by the end of the night. Usually a combination of alcohol and woeful relationships lead women into this vulnerable classification but it happens, often. Guys know this and they wait, they line the dancefloors eyeing up their prey, make their approaches and take advantage of the situation. This is normally the last hour of the night and is one of the standard plays from the guy playbook. We didn't write the playbook, we just started to document it. Are we condoning these shallow tactics? No. Are we trying to educate? No. We're just sharing, it's up to you, the reader, to decide how you want to read this blog and use it. For every shallow person out there, there's another shallow person willing to accept them. If you want to pick up the dregs, they're there,  we don't, we just wait for them and watch the ensuing maelstrom they create amongst the simple menfolk that live or visit London.  So, lets do the first official report...

      Halfway between nursing a hangover and getting over the Red Bull buzz. Schumi's just been knocked out of the Monaco Grand Prix. Another weekend… Another  Amazing  party! Not sure if I'm feeling guilty about snogging the face off the girl that my mate is planning to take out this week or just horny about the stuff we got up to? Well, she  was  sitting on my lap in the club sipping champagne from between my lips! All I'm gonna say is he shouldn't have been in Dublin sleeping with the girl he met on the plane a week ago!  Now, that of course does not detract from the other lovely that was also sitting on my lap last night. Lovely as she was (in fact sexy is such an understatement) I personally didn't have any amorous intent.  Do you get the picture? Are you starting to see where this blog is going? Well, you ain’t seen  nothing  yet. I hope I've wetted your appetite. Of course you'll have a lot of questions about where, who, what. To understand that you'll just have to keep reading; we'll try to brief you on the background, history and give you lots more info. I say  we  'cause I'm only one member of a team. My partner in crime will tell you some more. But I'll leave it for him to explain.  PS: There's something just so funny about watching old movies on a lazy Sunday afternoon, pizza boxes discarded on the floor after a good Grand Prix predicting the events of the next scene. Well, we have seen it about a hundred times before. The movie in question is "The Poseidon Adventure".

      I really, really, didn't intend to go out. I promised myself that I wouldn't go back to  urlLink Tiger Tiger  until I'd got my physical training programme under control. Normally, these little promises work. On Friday, it didn't but it also signalled the start of another 3 day binge in London's West End.  I went out with the team from the office to a local pub for friendly drinks on the expense account. I'd only been at this client's office for 8 weeks so wasn't particularly friendly with anybody and after nursing a pint of Guinness for an hour I decided to make my excuses and disappear. As a computer techie I'm supposed to be a nerd all-round and up until 3 years ago I would have been. I started with computers at the age of 10, some 24 years ago, and used to spend all day in front of them, sometimes playing games but mostly programming. Even to this day I'm still a computer hobbyist, trying to fit in web development time in between working and partying but the social ineptness I once had has largely disappeared with thanks to NK and several litres of vodka.  I left the pub as I wanted to buy another computer but also go home and do something productive before going to bed. I'm not a pub or bar person and really don't like sitting in there, drinking pints of beer, passively smoking and talking rubbish to people you hardly know. However, put me in a club where I've got a 3am finish and I'm a lot happier. As I left, the guys asked where I was going and I said that I was going clubbing and to meet some friends. They suggested they wanted to come to but needed more time to warm up.  Anyhow I rang my friend, Mickey, as I walked towards Tottenham Court Road, the hub of electronic retail outlets in London. She told me that she'd just been fired due to a personality clash so I spent most of the journey chatting to her, lending a sympathetic ear. By the time I'd got to the computer shops they'd all closed for the night. It was 7:20pm after all and these places seem to open and close to their own non-standard opening hours. So I thought I'd go back to the pub, have some vodka and see what happens. Maybe these guys would actually go out, maybe they wouldn't, what else did I have to do? No new gadgets to play with so the evening officially started.  After a quick drink, 4 of the guys decided they wanted to move on and looked to me for leadership. I suggested  urlLink Sway  across the road as there were lots of beautiful and classy women in there. I also suggested we could move on to Tiger Tiger afterwards as Sway gets a bit empty towards the end of the night. They decided just to go straight to Tiger but were worried about the dress code. One of the guys had jeans and trainers, the other one had jeans and these are not usually allowed in Tiger on a Friday night, too low class and too indicative of potential trouble. However, I figured we'd get in without too much trouble. Sure enough no trouble getting in, just had a little issue with the police on the way. They thought one of the guys had something in his pocket or had thrown something away as we walking down the street because we were "looking around, behind us". We crossed the street, next to a mini-roundabout in Covent Garden where lots of cars criss-cross, what do they expect us to do!?!  Anyhow we got to Tiger, said "Hi" to John on the front door, indicated that the guys were with me and we were welcomed in. Perfect. We moved upstairs to the Kaz Bar where the regulars tend to go and where the clientele is usually better. The tourists and the uninformed tend to congregate on the ground floor but it also has the main dance floor playing the usual mix of cheesey pop and r&b floor-filling tunes. At the Kaz Bar we had a couple of drinks, and started the evening's entertainment. A few looks were exchanged, a few daring raids were made by the boys but nothing successful. As the night progressed two of them left and so we down to three. One found a nice little Turkish girl but had the omnipresent ugly Babysitter accompanying her. Neither of us wanted to provide the Chopper Cover but eventually some guy equipped with strong Beer Goggles took her out of the equation. The guy with me than had to leave as it was time for his last train so I was left all alone, in Tiger Tiger, around Midnight. So I went downstairs, to the club and to say hello to the DJ down there.  Within 2 minutes of walking into the DJ booth I'd spotted two other regulars out on the dancefloor, two Turkish girls, friends of the DJ, early 20s but very personable. I'd met them a few months before and had some fun as these girls loved their house music and knew how to express it on the dancefloor. They beckoned me to come out and dance with them, so I obliged and I kept on obliging until the club closed at 3am. I also had more of an opportunity to chat to them, particularly the short one with black hair and the gorgeous smile. Sadly her English isn't that good and our conversation was a little awkward, particularly as she loses her confidence easily. One of these days I'll get her name, it's just irrelevant so much of the time that I just forget to ask. Every time I left them, they'd get hit on by the guys and they'd end up asking me to come back out and scare them away. The only problem for me is that it's so damn hot down there that I work up a sweat in very little time and I don't think it's very attractive to be soaking wet when chatting to somebody.  Also spotted two of the security staff getting their favours in the DJ booth from two sisters. It was discreet and unseen but  I  knew what was going on. After approximately 300 visits to that club you know what's normal, what all the routines are and you know that security and girls don't go into the DJ booth unless it's for a little bit of flute playing.  I look forward to going back to work and seeing what happened to the guy with his Turkish girl. I'd already been told plainly that Turkish girls "don't shag" but then again, not every man wants to shag every woman. Really, they don't, well not initially anyhow. ;)  I also look forward to a return visit on Friday. I'm sure a few of the guys from the office will also want to return as I think I've got 4 more people addicted to the world of the TT. Maybe this time I'll get the name of the gorgeouse Turkish girl with the black hair, maybe I'll get her number too, only time will tell. As they say, slowly, slowly to catch a monkey.

      ...drink of course, just a small one, it is Sunday after all and bound to be quiet. I got there around 9pm as I'm having problems walking into a nightclub when it's still light outside so have to leave it quite late for it to feel right. Can't wait for Winter to arrive when it feels right to start drinking at 5pm!!!  Spent a lot of the time chatting to the Head Doorman, drinking a few concoctions the barman was making for me and was all set on going home until it got to about 11:30pm. The two bar staff I knew wanted to go out, as did the group of 8 Norwegian tourists, particularly the woman that was very interested in one of the bartenders. As usual they turned to me for part-ay-ing advice. Having conferred with the Head Doorman we agreed on Storm, Leicester Square.  It closes at 2am on a Sunday but stops serving alcohol at 12:30. We once had a run-in with the security at Storm so had never been back. However, we thought it would work out well as nobody really wanted a late night. I had to go to work and the bar staff had been drinking the previous night, as it was a leaving party for a colleague. So I took my Norwegian flock to Storm, bought lots of drink and waited for two bartenders to arrive. I also took one of their g/f's with me. The Norwegians left at around 1:15am, too drunk, too tired, etc. The guys eventually arrived at 1:45am, didn't have much time to enjoy their drinks before we got kicked out. After a brief food stop for the obligatory kebab, with chilli sauce, we decided to head off to Fabric. It's gay night, we're all straight but it serves alcohol and the music is good. Perfect.  Had to use the secret back door to get into the club but the five of us got in; me, two bartenders, one barback and one French g/f. And they were serving alcohol until around 4am, woohoo!!! More vodka, more Red Bull (the real stuff this time) and other assorted drinks. We found the straight area, away from the bare flesh of the buffed guys but we also ended up taking our shirts off. Somewhat liberating being able to do that in a London club without being ejected. If only we had the buffed bodies of the guys downstairs to match though, lol.  'Twas a good night though, even though I only got home in time to spend an hour in my coffin recharging my batteries. The morning at work was difficult, very difficult as the champagne, vodka and Red Bull was still coursing through my veins. But there I was, sat at my desk, seemingly doing some work, dressed in my suit, shirt and windsor knotted tie. To all intents and purposes I looked sober and sensible. Only I knew what had happened a few hours before. Everybody else just assumed I'd been in bed like a good boy, like the mild-mannered, computer geek I'm supposed to be.  Mild-mannered computer consultant by day, drunken part-ay animal by night. All it takes is an exchange of glasses for contact lenses and my superhero tranformation is complete.

      Got bored at home, had a think of what to do, decided to go to Tiger Tiger, get drunk, have some fun and see what happens. Got out of Piccadilly Circus tube station at 10pm on the dot. Didn't fancy paying the £10 entry charge for being 2 minutes late so decided to eat some raw fish, Sushi to be precise. I also thought I'd wash it down with a large, warm Sake and start the alcoholic mix with an Oriental base level.  I got into the club around 10:45pm and was just having my first drink when one of the DJs with his g/f came up to me. We had a chat, consumed B52s and then followed it with some of the usual elixir; vodka and Red Bull (or their cheap imitation, Rush). We then decided to hit the club and sample the music and the furnace like temperatures down in the basement. More alcoholic consumption followed, a little dancing with slowly grew and developed. This DJ can dance but he's probably the worst of the ones I know. However, his g/f, who's French can dance and she likes to wiggle her salsa loving hips. She's very slim, milky white and usually has a lot of her Gallic skin on display, particularly her washboard stomach that make all the other women envious as hell. So we started dancing, more and more and spent a long time dancing together with just an inch wide modesty air gap between us. The DJ wasn't too happy, kept on circling us, watching us intently and also pinching his g/f's derriere. Eventually he just pulled her away and I never saw her again, lol.  By this time it was after 2am though and the sauna had meant my shirt was absolutely soaked. My black shirt now looked like it was made of silk, it reflected light so well. Must remember not to wear jeans any more, particularly as Summer is finally here.  I then spent the rest of the hour dancing with a group of girls on a hen night, one in particular, Shelly or Sally, that kept on saying "You're lovely". All she needed to do was say that I was her beshtest friend ever and it would have confirmed how drunk she was. Nevertheless, she was having fun.  After the lights went up I spent 15 minutes chatting to the DJ, providing some feedback and developing another contact. It was only in the taxi going home that I realised that I'd left my credit card behind the bar upstairs, D'oh!  I'll have to go back tomorrow and pick it up. Whilst I'm there I might as well...

      Wimps!!! Not one person from the office made the night out. The guy that originally asked to go with me had a bad week as he found that his recent ex-g/f had actually been enjoying a bit on the side. That kind of put a damper on his part-ay-ing mood. Everybody else then came up with excuse after excuse, "I'm working tomorrow", "I'm going up to Manchester", "My cat died and my budgie needs consoling". Ok, I may have fabricated the last one.  So I ended up going alone as NK is sunning himself in the sweaty armpit of Europe, i.e. Turkey.  Quiet night, spent most of the night chatting to the DJ, enjoying the attention from the girlies who clearly thought I was important as I was in the DJ booth. Watched a couple of people getting ejected, drank very little but got a lift home for free.

      I called her today, to test the water and possibly arrange something in the next few days. Nothing happening. Delete. Move on.  Tomorrow sees a return to Tiger Tiger with a possé of office colleagues, mostly male. This should be an interesting night, especially as it's Friday again. Shame we have such a high proportion of dregs in our department. Maybe a set of champagne or tequila goggles will turn them into supermodels. Look! What's that pink thing in the sky flying past my window?  Ho hum. Will report Friday's exploits soon.
