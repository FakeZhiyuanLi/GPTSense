      [ Goofy Thoughts on a Unified Field Theory ]  I am addicted to our quest for a unified field theory that explains everything--if you don't know what I'm talking about, search Unified Field Theory on Google. It would take me too long to explain. Anyway, I keep thinking that if, and when, we truly discover am expression for this, it would have to explain EVERYTHING--in cluding social behavior, psychology, art, literature, etc., etc.  In keeping with my previous post--and the notion that the final theory will be so simple that it can be printed on a t-shirt--I thought I would contribute my goofy thought. Wouldn't it be comical if the final expression were as simple as:  E + R = 0  where E equals some positive integer (some positive energy) and R equals the negative of E. Zero then must be both an expression of value as well as a symbolic expression of infinite measure--everything and nothing at the same time. The notion being that everything in the universe--infinitely big and infinite small--has a positive value that tends toward individuality (repulsion) but exists in a constant state battle (equalibrium) against an equally strong force that is acting to keep it part of a larger whole (attraction). The result it both a zero-sum and a non-zero sum state at the same time (everything and notion simultaneously). Absolute and undefined in a single state--a single expression... "0" The beauty is that it says everything, is reducable from all expressions we currently use, and yet defines nothing. It answers everything yet defines nothing (which is a very important part of human existance). It would reilquish the need for God yet still demand God as a missing value in the equation--much like our understanding of life right now.   I know this is rediculous, but I thought someone might enjoy it.

      [ Addendum to Desire No. 1 ]  Many have said that human beings are social animals. I disagree. I see society as a drug. A diversion which begs us to come to the dance. To ignore who, and what, we really are--which is alone. Human beings are uniquely aware and at the same time afraid to be aware. We are so attracted to each other because we struggle with our inability to apply our awareness for the purpose of explaination. Like all popular drugs, unfortunately, society--the scoial high, if you will--ultimately fails us in the most important of goals. We come together with hopes and dreams of being recognized for who we are--as individuals. But the drug takes over. We join the crowd. We play our roles. And, then we leave each other with no real connection. No exposure. Exposure, in fact, is the antithesis of what society is about because society demands--at its extremes--either the protection of decorum or neglect and fantasy of absolute freedom. Exposure would ruin everything. When the drug takes hold you don't think about each other, you think about how much you enjoy your relationship with the drug. And when the drug wears off, you go home and go to sleep. This is more true that it sounds. When was the last time someone that you know--especially someone you know well--asked you "Who are you today?" How you have changed from 10 years ago? From 10 days ago? From 10 minutes ago? Or, "How are you the same person you have always been?" Deep down, I am somebody that no one has ever met. I am someone that no one has ever seen. Someone no one has ever heard from. No one has yet to ask me who I am. I bet you are in the same situation. The people in your life who want to know who you are, don't know you. The people in your life who know you, don't want to know who you are--not any more. They already think they know you.

      [ Secret Desire: No. 1 ]  I may only have one secret desire. It's hard to explain. To lay in a cold bed, under a pile of blankets too thick to see over, with the one person in the world who realizes what I'm missing. To spend as many hours as it takes to tell my life's story--the one no one has yet to ask me about.   I've yet to meet that person.

      [ Who get's hurt? ]  What is wrong with our hearts these days? Is it so wrong for two people to want to publically declare love for one another? Who is really hurt by two individuals who are in love with each other coming out and formalizing that love--that commitment to a hope and dream of love for life, and love after death? Isn't that--at it's core--all that gay couples are asking for? To be recognized as committed to one another in all actions--legal and non--in all assets, and, in the end, all decisions regarding property and wealth after death. To be completely frank, who's business is it to tell them that they shouldn't be allowed to make such a committment? Have we really taken to prefering a world of promiscuity over monogomy? One without committment and accountability to one in which the focus is responsibility and committment. And, as some might suggest, if it is "against God's will" for such relationships to exist--whatever that means--than shouldn't we leave the responsibility of judgement to God?   The debate over the "legality" or legitimacy of same-sex union is not one of spiritual, or moral, appropriateness. I'm sorry but it just isn't. I mean, come on people! If you want to "defend our world" against the "evils of same-sex marriage," than at least be honest about what you're doing. This is CLEARLY one group of beliefs colliding with another--or one faction of society declaring that thier beliefs are more just than someone else's. It this not a "melting pot"--the most "free and open" society on the planet? I'm sorry, but there is no other word for what is going on here.   This is simply another in a long line of our famous displays of predjudice. I am just flabbergasted that we are so lost that we lack the most minute amount of social dignity, or the smidgen of community, required to support love when it is presented to us. What will it  take? And, who get's hurt by allowing two people to protect and love each other? If we can't overcome these arcane ideals we are going to destroy everything we stand for--which by the way is not simply freedom of speech and freedom to bare arms. (These are only two of our constitutional protected rights. I think we need to spend a little more time reading, and a lot less time trying to protect ourselves from our personal sins.)

      [ Speaking Engagement in Ottawa ]  I forgot to post on this. Recently I spoke at the National Gallery in Ottawa on Graphic Design, VSA Partners, and annual report design for IBM. It was the first public speaking engagement I've ever participated in. It's a long story how this came about. The short story is, the wife of the partner I currently report to was threatening to have a baby 4 weeks early. So, I took his presentation, hopped on a plane, and flew to the very beautiful city of Ottawa. It was all very last minute--like I found out I was going 5 hours before I left. Anyway, it was a real thrill. I was pretty nervous about speaking--for a number of reasons--but everything turned out. I had a great time. The people I spoke to--Registered Graphic Designers of Ottawa (RGD)--were really incredible people.   The city was actually quite amazing. There is a river that runs through the town that, apparently, completely freezes over during the winter. You can pretty much skate the entire length of the river--so I'm told. Beautiful old buildings mixed with an interesting mix of contemporary--almost European--architecture. It appears to have a lot of new development as well. Beautiful, old arched bridges that span the river--truly heart-warming at night. It's certainly worth a second trip--or first if you've never been.   I will have to give both the city, and public speaking, a return visit--if I say so myself.

      [ New Blogger Templates Rock ]  I was just bitching to one of my co-workers about how much I hated the stock Blogger templates--and frnakly, I've been too busy to customize one for myself. Anyway, I love the new templates. Rock on!

      [ Mother's Day at Work ]  So, it's mother's day again and I didn't--necessarily--remember. Sent flowers a couple days ago for my mother's birthday (which I did remember) so, I'm thinking I got everything covered. Instead, I'm at the office. Good and bad news--we submitted a portfolio to try to win a project to design and produce the marketing and promotional materials for the 2006 Gay Games VII--which will be held in Chicago. We were awarded the job on Tuesday May 4th only to discover that, due to a lot of political issues, they needed a presentation of creative immediately--like on Thursday the 6th. It's a bit crazy, but that's the nature of the business sometimes. Anyway, due to an unexpected circumstance--the wife of the partner I report to started going into labor 4 weeks early--I had to move the presentation to tomorrow morning so I could fly to Ottawa and present a speech that he was committed to. All in all, this last week was a great deal of fun. This was the first public speech I've ever had to present. It went, surprisingly, quite well. Lots of applause. Easily 15+ questions from the audience. I really enjoyed it. So, now I am trying to finish the presentation for the Gay Games. Still working on my list of "euphemized" words. Definition: Euphemasia--the forced death of male asians due to overtly feminine behavior. :) Anyway, I will try to get it up for my next posting.

      [ Sun Sans Suits ]  In keeping with the "all work and no play" theme of this blog, I thought I might mention that I and a friend of mine are currently planning a summer trip to Miami. We both recently discovered that we share a common summer hobby--searching out legal (or semi-legal) clothing optional beaches in the US. So, we are planning a 5-day trip to one of the few legal clothing optional beaches in the States--Haulover Beach in Miami. It should be a riot. 5 days of nothing but sun and sand--literally. We're even contemplating staying at a clothing optional, gay, bed and breakfast in Fort Lauderdale. I'll post more when I know more.

      [ It's raining dots ]  It's a kind of gloomy day here in Chicago--low 50's, raining, tired of reading Dostoyevsky. So, I decided to head down to the office and try to get a little work done. At the moment, I'm trying to find a way to make a bunch of dots and a few words "more meaningful" for a client. Sound meaningless? It kind of is, but it's also far trickier than it sounds. Contemplating a list of words and phrases in the English language that have become meaningless--or simply euphemistic--due to over, or inappropriate, use. I'll post it later; but, an example would be: interesting, meaningful, and improvement. Context: Take a look at most products and services offered to consumers and businesses today. Most are being offered as ways to make some aspect of your life more interesting or more meaningful. And, all are intended to be an improvement upon some previous state.   The reality is few actually achieve the status they carry. The most compelling new product in the last 24 months really would be the iPod--I know it's way over-published at the moment, but it's an incredible product from all vantage points. It's the most elegant user-centered product in decades. The services behind it have achieved nothing less than rallying a nation of consumer criminals around a common, legal, evolution in behavior. And, it may very well save a significant piece of one of our primary industries in the US from inevitable obliteration due to a financial model that was--and still is to some degree--chronically out-dated. Is there an iPod solution for the airline, automotive, and insurance industries? I wonder.

      [ Why am I choosing to blog? ]  Blogs are empty vessels filled with empty thoughts, rhetorical observations, and--like our brains--disconnected content leading to meaningful results. My blog should be no different.   I am a creative director working for am internationally recognized design firm in Chicago. I try as much as possible to avoid all media communications--newspaper, television, etc. I have an insatiable need for information though; and so, I have been on a roughly 13-year run of reading pretty much any book I can get my hands on. Topics I'm interested in--but would never profess deep knowledge of--would include: physics and mathematics, the history of scientific discovery, mtyhology and "man's" attempts to describe existance, psychology and the nature of human interaction, social constructs or humanity's attempt to model and control itself (community, commerce, government), sexuality, the development of individual identity, education, the humanities, design as communication, art and design as expression of individual thought, product design, furniture design, architecture--as both elegant structure and/or propoganda, philosophy...and a number of other topics.  The core issue why I am deciding to begin blogging is really to try to capture some of my fleeting thoughts. It's going to be challenging for me to get some of the things out that I want to capture because I am a fairly conversationally oriented person. What I mean is, conversations--and the nature and structure of conversations--tend to draw out of me certain thoughts and responses that I otherwise would not express. I find it tricky to get in that same place when i am just writing. We'll see what happens.   At the very least, this should be interesting.
