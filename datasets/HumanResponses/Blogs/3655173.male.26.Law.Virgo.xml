						   As of the date of this post, my profile pic is of three dudes wearing interesting outfits standing with their arms crossed. Let me explain.  As I have discussed previously, I am an instructor at Indiana University. I teach Brazilian Jiu Jitsu as well as an academic course, Criminal Procedure. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is unlike most martial arts which award technical expertise with a Black Belt. Technical (book smarts) expertise in Jiu Jitsu is realized during the early stages of the blue belt level. At this point, a student should be able to speak with authority on the history, benefits, and detriments of Brazilian jiu jitsu (BJJ).   An upper blue belt (I would say 3 and 4 stripers) would be a black belt by most Karate, Tae Kwon Do, and Judo standards if those standards were applied to BJJ. However, this is definitely not the case for BJJ. Belt level promotions are controlled by several factors. First, one must spend at least a minimal amount of time with an instructor capable of promoting. There are relatively few such instructors in the U.S. Next, one must show not only technical prowess, but practical ability! BJJ is an art that allows you to train "all out" and test your abilities to their extreme without imposing significant injury to your opponent/partner. Thus, unlike Eagle Claw Kung Fu, we as BJJ practitioners cannot hide behind the statement "well if we really showed you how much we know, you would be dead." LOL  So back to the explanation. The man on the left in the pristene white uniform is my friend Kelly Wherley (a.k.a. Que Si, KCDubya, Wherldiggity). The man in the center with the black uniform and a very worn black belt with frayed white edges is Professor Caique. He is a BJJ legend! He is my black belt instructor and friend.  The guy in the blue uniform and blue belt with three white stripes is Me. I had just received my third stripe that day and Caique and I discussed my continued pursuit of my jiu-jitsu goals which include remaining with his team and instruction.  So, I don't mean to hate on other styles of Martial arts, they each address different aspects of what Bruce Lee entitled the 4 ranges of fighting, but I will proudly boast that BJJ is the toughest style to achieve black belt, technical, and practical mastery of, and that is why I love it so much.   Human Chess.  Tim

						   Ella delia...  She is in there and "ripe." I keep telling people that the 9th month proves that "a watched pot never boils."   I want to meet her, see her, hold her, and love her. She is going to change my life! Tick, Tock...  If she knew the attention she is getting even before she has arrived I am sure she would smile. There is love and support walking her around. But she is cooking and waiting until her moment.  Delia, or Ella, or Ella Delia is still future tense. But for how long?   Tim

						   YOUR training family   Posted by Tim on Monday, 17 May 2004, at 11:07 p.m.  Today I was reading an article by Royler Gracie (one of the legends of BJJ). He reiterated the importance of forming a quality training family within your jiu-jitsu club.   Let me explain how I view MY "training family":   Grandpa Caique: Offers the soundest jiu-jitsu wisdom though he is not physically present all the time.   Greg Lucas: Is like a father figure when it comes to jiu-jitsu. This guy has laid the smack down on me many times and punks me anytime I get cocky!   Chris Hayre: Also a father figure with more patience for my questions than Greg (plus he lets me think I "earn" positions on him :))   Kedar: Definitely an older brother(though years younger in age and pounds lighter in weight). Here is a guy who can throw new riddles my way that make me think. We battle hard, have different approaches to the game, but I have MAD respect for the man! Kedar may be the first relevant member of your jiu-jitsu family... he may be your father figure... if so, damn you are lucky! This guy is stellar.   John Hill: Spiritual mentor who helps me keep reality in focus.   Matt Stratta: When it comes to a jiu-jitsu family, this guy is my close brother. He is silky smooth with his technique and has a steele trap mind for the details. In the perfect world, he would be watching every class I teach to remind me to show the one technique I slipped on.   Jeremiah Ashe: I have mad love and respect for this brother. He has helped my game significantly. Laid the beatings down repeatedly, and has the humbleness and control over his ego that we should all aspire to mimic.   Steve Corenflos: Another brother that I feel a strong sense of loyalty toward. At 135lbs, this guy is a tough MF'er! His game is going to get tough the more he trains. Oh, yeah, watch out, this guy is going to Lucas for training! That extra effort will reap him significant rewards!   Paul Hogan: I was ducking you bro! Hogan tough as nails. I am happy to have him in my training family. He has legitimately tapped me freqently. He makes me play my game tightly, and even then it is not enough. At 19 or 20 whichever it may be, he is a force to be reckoned with. I promise that I will reckon that force every chance I get because I get better each time.   Jim VanAtta: New member to the family, but valued nontheless. Jim is strong, wirery, and has great mental prowess when it comes to jiu-jitsu. I enjoy teaching him the moves because his follow up questions force me to rethink the game.   I could stop here and be a very fortunate jiu jitsu student! But to stop here would be to leave out some other very valuable members that I call upon to help me train.   Little brothers include: Will Buck, Ryan Kloman, Andrea Robertson (yep a brother), Lobato, Joe Sunderhaus, Ben Markley, Rebecca Remilard (another yep a brother), Julie Kedzie (though many of you have seen her whip my ass with gloves on!).   I know I have forgotten others, but I trained with Lucas tonight which means I took a beating an my mind is not all there. I apologize.   What I want you to do is find a familial makeup that works for you. Some of you will need to have more brother's than fathers, some of you will be comfortable having many fathers and few brothers. (Gender's can be flipped for the women!)   We are very fortunate to have a jiu-jitsu club that is large and inexpensive. Make the most of it!   Tim   P.S. DTM

						   Preparing for Battle   Posted by Tim on Wednesday, 2 June 2004, at 10:21 a.m.  Currently our club is in preparation for an upcoming tournament. Of course not all of the members of the club are going to compete.   We don't require it! Nor do we expect it!   The strength of our club is the fact that even those who are not going to be competing show up to practice to push those who will be competing. It has been awesome to see the turn out to club practices and the efforts put out by all.   Some of the guys are going to compete to gain exposure and experience and have a good time. This is an important opportunity that competing in practice does not give. Approaching a tournament with this mind set allows one to compete without being concerned about being in PERFECT condition, or feeling superior. One can go with the flow and meet great grapplers, watch awesome matches, and become inspired to work a new aspect of their game.   Others in the club are looking to continue their tournament improvements. Their objective is to confront a rival, place a little higher, or simply survive the first or second round. I emphasize to these participants that conditioning and mat time are crucial.   Finally, there are some in our club that are going to compete to Win. This is the toughest challenge! In order not to be "bs-ing" one's self, the competitor must train like a champion. They must train not only their body but their mind. There must be no question that when you step on the mat you are SURE you are going to win!   If you are not interested in competing, don't feel lost or left out. Come help us train! I promise that you will learn some valuable practical concepts by being around. Our competition team will be eternally grateful as well.   So, the date is set, June 26th. The divisions are relative mysteries, so focus on making yourself as prepared to wage the battle you want to wage at the tournament, whether it is just to get some mat time, improve your finish, or take the trophy!   Train Hard and I will see you at club.   Tim

						   Welcome to the Sledd Zone. This is my first blog, so I am going to be experimenting with various formats and topics. Mostly what I want to get out of this is a place for me to dump information that I am feeling, thinking, realizing, or finding useful.   Hopefully this will a great way for me to express myself so that I can come to know myself better and those who wish to know something about me will be able to feel a pulse.  So... this begins the Sledd Zone, a portal to the strange, normal, sick, and lost!

						    An explanation of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: >(as posted on my web page two days ago)       Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (hereinafter BJJ) is a martial art that focuses on minimizing the damage done to combatants. Striking of any sort is de-emphasized due to the potential for self-injury as well as the likelihood that the party absorbing the strike will be injured. You may be asking, how can BJJ ever expect to work against a 'real life' angry person who wants to knock your head off? Answer: we carefully measure the distance between our attacker and ourselves. Then we move in to clinch or take-down the attacker to take away the space necessary to employ an effective striking attack.        Once the clich has occurred, or a take down has happened, the object of BJJ is to gain a dominant position on the attacker so as to either 1. convince them to calm down and cease their attack, 2. employ a BJJ attack such as a joint lock or choke, or 3. utilize short range strikes to overcome the opponent.         BJJ is also a sport. Competitors start on their feet and seek to defeat their opponent by gaining a submission (opponent taps the body of the competitor signaling desire to stop the match) or by points which are awarded for positional dominance. Matches vary in length based on skill level, ranging from 5-10 minutes with no breaks.            BJJ is unique in that its moves do not require great strength or speed. (Unlike striking styles, wrestling, or judo). Instead, the more advanced fighters win using a mastery of leverage, baiting, and techniques that emphasize the weakness inherent with the human body. Submission holds focus on the weak joints of the human body, chokes focus on the easy availabilitly of blood sources to the brain to be impeded, and sweeps take advantage of the awkward centers of balance in different positions. Through a mastery of these concepts employed in various techniques, a very small BJJ student can quickly render unconscious or incapable of fighting, a much larger, stronger, and tougher attacker.            Many find the allure of BJJ to be the complex mental components necessary to excel. It has been called 'human chess.' When two fighters are at the same skill level, the one who will win the match will be the one who is thinking more moves ahead of the adversary. Unlike wrestling where a match is ended based on body positioning (i.e. the opponent's back is flattened to the mat), in BJJ you must cause you opponent to submit... they must signal defeat. This can be quite a feat!  Tim 7/11/04

						   Wow, since my last post (June 22) there have been some eventful weeks. On June 26, I competed in the Hoosier Open Jiu Jitsu tournament held in Indianapolis, and put on by Caique and Greg Eldred of Indianapolis Jiu Jitsu. It was a very well run tournament with great competitors. The purple belt divisions saw some great battles as Angelo Popofski took on Mike "Joker" Aref of McVicker's Competition Team. These guys battled three times in very technical and competitive fights. Bernie Ash of Louisville's Caique Academy won his Purple Belt division.  I was able to win my division! The first match was a hard battle where I was on the defensive nearly the whole match being down 3-0 very early. I was able to secure a sweep in the last minute of the match and pass the half guard into mount to make the score 6-4.   My second match was against a very strong opponent. I attempted several of my best takedowns to no avail. Finally, he pulled guard. I was able to pass his butterfly guard and secure knee on belly from two different sides making a score of 7-0. At one point he was able to get to his knees and ahold of one of my legs. Just as I had suggested in club, the sprawl drill came through for me. I was able to fend off his attack and front one of my own. I attacked his collars looking for a choke. I tried to get both hooks in, but stayed in control with one. Time ran out with a score of 7-0 me!  I called Angie and got in the car. (She was due any minute)!  That next week we got to meet our sweet daughter! Let me tell you the story:  The doctor told Angie that Friday July 2nd would be the day we could have Angie if we wanted. Everything was ready, we were simply waiting for the contractions. Upon hearing this, Angie got excited and her normal aches and pains decreased. She openly prayed for natural initiation before Friday, but the light was at the end of the tunnel we were finally going to get to see her.  Friday morning Angie woke up earlier than I did, and organized our things. When I got up, I took care of the dogs, and we were ready to go. Upon arrival to the hospital, we both were nervous, but excited. We ascended to the Maternity Ward and met the nursing staff who promptly put us in "room 5." It was a nice room with a couch, two chairs, the fantastic birthing (transformer bed) and a stool. The room itself had woodfloors, a large window, and wooden cabinets hiding all of the "medical equipment" and monitors.  The room was comfortable.  Angie was put on the typical monitors (One measuring duration and intensity of contractions while the other listened and measured Ella's heart). Almost immediately after being placed on the monitors, the nursed asked Angie if she was aware of the contractions she was having at that very minute. Angie did not.  On time, the Doctor came in and broke Angie's water. From that point to nearly 10 hours later at 5:46p.m. Angie worked to deliver Ella, everything from walking lap after lap of the ward, to intense labor, to about 45 minutes of timed pushing. The process is an absolute miracle (cliche but absolutely true)!  There is nothing like seeing the birth of your child. The first, verified, facts I learned about Ella were that she had lots of hair. In fact, her hair was 'born' quite a while before her head followed.   Another cliche about having children is that they will change your life. I was skeptical, but again, the cliche is true. I realized how heroic it is to be a mother, from the birth process to feedings, women are awesome!   My priorties have shifted as well. I will drop anything to tend to Ella. (This is not characteristic of my steadfast belief in seeing through of planned activities). She is much more important. I am excited for the point when I have adjusted to her presence and can involve her in my activities, but for now, she is running the show.  So, I may post infrequently, but there is a reason. A fantasticly beautiful little squawk box named Ella Delia.
