      I had the pleasure of experiencing the film "The Terminal" directed by Steven Speilberg, starring Tom Hanks.  I actually walked out of the theatre feeling satisfied with my $10 purchase, which doesn't happen all that often.I was captivated by Tom Hank's character throughout the entire movie, it also takes a look at our new found airport homeland security system at work. If you havn't seen this movie yet then stop whatever it is you are doing and go!  I give this film modist 5 out of 5   Synopsis: In this film by director Steven Spielberg, an Eastern European war refugee (Hanks) lands at a New York City airport at the very moment his beleaguered homeland ceases to exist, invalidating his immigration papers. Homeless and countryless, he makes the airport his home, eventually falling in love with a flight attendant (Zeta-Jones)and forming many friendships with the emplyees of the airport.    urlLink View the Trailer

       urlLink    This weekend I finished restoring this Old Frogger Cocktail Cabinet, I actually built this a few years back, but it has changed hands and the new owner wanted to have it updated and repaired.  this cabinet is now a two player Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator with over 30 classic Arcade titles(running on Windows 98se).  It was nice seeing it again after having sold it to a co-worker in LA in 2002.  &nbsp; urlLink

      Im still slaving away on people's technical problems at "Keep Me Posted" my place of work. I guess you can call me a Professional troubleshooter. (current Title; Post Production Video Engineer/Avid Systems Tech) I've been in the market for a new Job, hopefully one more creative and and enjoyable. there is a version of Treasure Island currently in the developmental stage, yet to be Greenlit for Pre Production.  My Friend Erik is trying to get me a job on the Film as the assistant to the Production Designer, yes assistant, gotta start at the bottom again, but the project sounds fun, and it most likely will be shot in New Orleans, so I would be living there for around 6 months on location.  like I said it isnt 100% confirmed yet, so Im trying not to get my hopes up just yet. Ill type a discription of the job in a later post. when Im not working im learning.  I've been working on several video projects. Im doing a :15 sec. logo opening for a friend's Audio Post Company, I just finished a montage of my Family Vacation in Vegas, and Im editing a short subject Performance reel for a Musician friend of mine.  each little project is a good experience, and helps build my resume.  So, what do I do in my free time? hmmm......

       "Fox TV's syndication unit, Twentieth Television, abruptly canceled American Idol host Ryan Seacrest's talk show On-Air With Ryan Seacrest one day after a broadcast group of 20 stations, Sinclair Broadcasting, dropped it. The show debuted in January, and has rarely risen above a 1.0 rating. In a statement, the syndicator said, "It was our desire that the program would appeal to a wide array of viewers, but unfortunately, the marketplace's response was not as strong as we had hoped."

      It was brought to my attention today that our Satellite receiver hasn't been working for the last two weeks.&nbsp; Apparently it has dropped all of the channels and only a prompt is displayed and it says, "No connection with Host" so I guess I haven’t watched TV in two weeks, because this was news to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Guess I haven’t been all that impressed with the selection these days.&nbsp; Sorry but reality shows about a hot chick having to choose between a handful of average Joes doesn't really do it for me.&nbsp; And I think we can all do without another Cop Drama series, can't we? Even the discovery channel which I LOVE to watch has fallen short of original programming, with a monotonous repetition of the same promos, and short subjects. Apparently I’m not the only one who is "getting bored with TV". &nbsp;None of NBC's Thursday-night "must-see" programs made the top-ten list Last week as the network recorded its lowest Thursday numbers in history. the other Major Networks weren't to fat behind either.&nbsp; According to Neilson (the rating system used to statistically determine how many Americans are watching a particular channel) CBS had the best luck last week clinching 8 of the ten spots, with NBC only snagging two.&nbsp;  Here is the list of shows that took the top ten spots last week:  1. CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, CBS, 8.8/15;  2. Without a Trace, CBS, 8.7/15;  3. CSI: Miami, CBS, 7.9/13;  4. Law and Order, NBC, 7.4/13;  5. Everybody Loves Raymond, CBS, 7.3/12;  6. Two and a Half Men, CBS, 7.3/12;  7. Law and Order: SVU, NBC, 7.0/12;  8. Amazing Race: 5, CBS, 6.9/12;  9. 60 Minutes, CBS, 6.5/13;  10. Cold Case, CBS, 6.4/12.   Hmm... Maybe I’m the only one who's sick of the Cop Shows, No offence Dad :)

      welcome to another continuation on what I like to call the informative part of my Blog. this weeks post is on the ever popular and often misunderstood job in the film business.&nbsp; The Producer, or Producers as it is now customary to have at least four nowadays. Talking from experience with various producers on various projects, these people worry alot about everything all the time.&nbsp; if something isn't going according to the plan, those producers will be right there asking you questions, and listing their outragious demands till your blue in the face. to simplify this description I will list each type of producer and try to hit all of the major ones in this post.   Producer:  The executive who packages the project and supervises the production of the film from conception to distribution. Usually reports to the Executive Producer or the studio who is funding the film.   Executive Producer:  &nbsp;Arranges for the financing and distribution of the picture or in some cases a group of pictures. Title sometimes retained by a Distributor who finances or causes the financing of a Picture. has no involvement in the technical aspect of the filming process.&nbsp; He/She mainly handles the business and legal issues.    Line Producer   :  A producer&nbsp;who is responsible for managing every person and issue during the making of a film. such as Pay scales, Kit Rentals, and department budget issues. &nbsp;Line producers only work on one film at a time.   Assistant to the Producer:  The Assistant to the Producer is the Producer's main assistant who assists in the performance of his or her duties. Although the Producer may have additional secretaries, the Assistant to the Producer assigns and supervises all Production Assistants in the absence of the Producer.    Associate Producer   :  &nbsp;an individual who performs a limited number of producing functions delegated to her/him by a producer. an example would be attending the ADR Sessions at the Audio mix stages, and screening talent with the Casting director.

      I've been working on a Video online editing/visual effects system at work trying to learn it when I can, and volunteer for as many projects as I can handle.&nbsp; I think they are finally getting it that I want to run their  urlLink Quantel&nbsp;iQ .&nbsp; We currently only have one guy that knows how to run it and he&nbsp;is also our Edit Box operator, so besides him I'm the only other person who knows how to run it.&nbsp; I see this as a great opportunity to move in on the back up editor position.&nbsp; This week I worked on a film Called "Riverman" which will air on A&E sometime this fall. Its a drama about the Green River Killings that happened years ago and the detectives used Ted Bundy to help capture the killer. The film is actually pretty good, a couple of recognizable actors.&nbsp;&nbsp;The film was digitized and&nbsp;offlined at our facility and this week the&nbsp;final cut&nbsp;was being onlined and Color Corrected then output to HD along with the final Audio Mix then&nbsp;sent to FotoKem to be Printed back to film.&nbsp;(an interesting process which I will have to explain some other time),&nbsp;anyway I was excited to finally get a chance to work on a decent film using the  urlLink iQ .&nbsp; The learning curve is steep and there are many elements to the software that I have yet to&nbsp;discover,&nbsp;so it is going to take me some time before i can really perform well on it, But I hope to be cutting more as they let me.

      You're sitting in the theatre the film has ended, there is a fade to black then an extremely long list of names and titles begins.&nbsp; For most movie goers this is the cue to stand up, leave their trash on the floor and exit.&nbsp; Then there are those very few who sit and watch the scrolling names to its end, which if you are in an epic film could take 10 to 15 minutes. These people could know someone involved in the film, they could be trying to get their $10.00 worth, or they just like reading hundreds of random names and job titles.&nbsp; Take your pick.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Well believe it or not every one of those names had a job to do on that film, and while some are pretty obvious with their apparent title like makeup artist, or costume designer, some titles may leave you scratching your head and wondering, "What the heck does a Key Grip do?"&nbsp; Well, for some reason I feel it my duty to inform and entertain on this site I will tell you.  A Key Grip Assists the Director of Photography and&nbsp;is responsible for&nbsp;the lighting procedures. He/She also assists other departments in the loading and unloading of their equipment. He/She&nbsp;assists the&nbsp;other crewmembers&nbsp;in the sound, wardrobe, camera, electrical and props departments without actually running&nbsp;the equipment. Think of it like that guy who helps you set up your living room then leaving it up to you to turn on the lights, and set your VCR.  &nbsp;  Little bonus Title: The "Grip" assists the Key Grip in his duties.  &nbsp;  Stay tuned for more.

      So, I’m hangin’ out in the scheduling office, talking with our new scheduler Michael.  He has actually been here at Keep Me Posted for over a month but he still walks around saying, “hi I’m the new guy”. We have very similar tastes in dry, witty, and sometimes unconventional humor, so we hit it off pretty good from the start.  The more we chatted the more I realized that this guy really enjoys life and all the crazy things in it, which was quite a refreshing thing to be around, even if for a few minutes to chat.  I found out that he and his wife had a website that documented their travels around America, and even parts of Europe.  I also found out that he was the owner of a car I had seen parked outside the production offices when I worked on "Undressed" for MTV.  a peculiar car (see the links below) quite original and impressionable in a disturbing kind of way.  Anyway... we started talking about movies that we enjoyed and would recommend, and it got me inspired to create a little list of my "Must See" films. So keep an eye out for that list, and until then check out Mikey's interesting and vivacious life and possessions.  urlLink Butts Across America   urlLink Keyboard Car

      Tonight I did a recording session with Scott (a friend from High school who lives in LA too.) he put together a music track which resembled a Beastie Boys track, and asked me to write the lyrics for it.&nbsp; Scott has made a profession, and quite a successful one at that, from writing songs for Television and various music libraries (a collection of music that can be purchased by studios to be used in their shows)&nbsp;his most notable shows are, "the Osborne’s" and&nbsp;"South Park".&nbsp; &nbsp;I have written for Scott before, have 6+ songs Scott and I&nbsp;have written together out floating around in a music library already, which enabled me to join the American Society of Composers and Performers which pays me the residuals I make every quarter&nbsp;from on air performances of those songs.&nbsp; I agreed and he gave me 4 days to get a hook, and 4 verses together to record on Tuesday (tonight). After spending the weekend listening to all the beastie Boys albums I had, which are great albums by the way. "Hello Nasty" is definitely in my&nbsp;list of top ten. &nbsp;I drafted out the lyrics and delivered them to Scott after I got off work. &nbsp;He was pleased with&nbsp;it and told me I was going to be the talent for the track as well.&nbsp; Uh oh... so I had to Rap my own lyrics.&nbsp; To make a long story short, I ended up Rapping on the track, and trying to yell as loud as the "Boys", which&nbsp;the song was intended to imitate. After a few hundred takes and some pitch shifting enhancements he had enough to start mixing with.&nbsp; I will post the&nbsp;song as soon as Scott finishes the mix, and you all can hear what a white boy from the burbs of Highlands Ranch Colorado sounds like.&nbsp; It should be interesting.&nbsp; Watch out Beastie Boys there's a new white rapper in town!

      Since I had mentioned the possibility of assisting a Production Designer, I thought I would start with a description of what a Production Designer's responsabilities are. &nbsp; Designers are responsible for the visual concept of&nbsp;the film. They work closely with the director to help them achieve their interpretation; considering sets, locations, graphics, props, lighting, camera angles and costumes.  Once the concept is decided, designers manage the work of the design team and those responsible for set construction. Designers tend to specialise in either&nbsp;film, TV or Theatre. They often form a strong partnership with a particular director and work together with that person on many productions.  The terms stage designer (theatre), production designer, set designer or art director (TV and film) have also been used to describe the job.   work activities might then include:  reading scripts to identify factors which signal a particular visual style meeting the producer and director to discuss concepts and production requirements planning and monitoring the design budget providing scale drawings or models for studio or theatre sets producing design ideas for costumes, wigs, props, special effects or graphics identifying and assessing potential studios and locations sourcing appropriate materials and researching effects presenting ideas to others (eg actors, camera operators) researching, estimating and preparing a property list (props are items handled by the actors) instructing the set construction company, scenic artists, special effects and monitoring their work working&nbsp;with the costume designer, director of photography, props, lighting and sound directors being present during rehearsals and at filming to advise on visual presentation.  In some cases the Designer has up to two assistants who help with the daily logistics, communication&nbsp;and schedualing of each task, and&nbsp;assist in the research and development.  &nbsp;

      So, I made it back from Maui, and having married Brad off, my mission was a success.&nbsp; The trip was much needed.&nbsp; Something about being on an island drinking fruity mixed cocktails, (with an umbrella and cherry.) which is so relaxing.&nbsp; It didn't take long for that care free contentment to dissolve away once I returned to Los Angeles, fought traffic home, was cut off by a guy in a BMW, and made it to work just in time to help solve a standard definition serial digital synchronization inconsistency issue.&nbsp; ohhh Maui how I miss you so...

      Growing up I often fantasized about filming the next great Blockbuster Movie, I even attempted a few short masterpieces with dad’s hi-tech VHS Camcorder. (Thanks for letting me use it Dad)  I gathered together a few friends, came up with an action sequence, grabbed the camera, ran down to the Baseball field, and started yelling "ACTION" and hitting the red button.  These moments of creative inspiration usually fell short of any dialogue, or cohesive plotline, and more often then not got left on the video tape for mom to wipe out with one of her recorded episodes of "Dallas". I guess this where I should say, "If I only knew then what I know now". Once technology finally dropped its price tag and became available to the novice moviemaker, I started using the computer to cut the video together.  While experimenting with all of the processes to complete my picture, I would sit back in my chair holding my forehead in my hands and wonder how the heck those big films ever get done and what all of those names at the end of the movie or TV show do?  Well, after five years out here in Hollywood I finally got some answers.  So, now that I "know now what I wish I knew back then" I will share a few of these strange and up until now unknown Movie making Job Descriptions with you.  Keep an eye out for them in later Posts!

      On July 7th I'm flying to Maui to be the best man at my Highschool friend, Brad Cogburn's wedding. This will be my first time to the islands so Im excited to see how tropical it really is. Not sure if I will have the time or money to go scuba diving but I will definately try to go on a snorkle tour of some kind.  The rehersal dinner is the evening I fly in, and the Wedding is on the 8th.  I will return to Los Angeles on the 12th of July just in time to drop off my bags and head to work.  While im in Maui I will be staying at a bed and Breakfast called Blue Horizons which is on the west coast line.  after spending a week in Boston Last year at a a bed and breakfast I don't think I will ever stay at a commercial hotel again.  the prices per night are about the same if not cheaper.  urlLink Maui Bed and Breakfast - Vacation in Lahaina, Hawaii

      On Friday I recevied a Letter from my landlord informing me of the inspection that was conducted earlier and that he noticed a fish tank in my room.  According to my contract no "liquid furniture is alowed on the premises, and the fish tank has to be removed in 3 days.  After trying to come up wiath a way to hide it at a neighbors or discuising it as a dresser, I decided to just take it down and store it until I can get a Home.  My landlord has been bugging me about moving out, since I am under the protective blanket of Rent control they can only raise my rent 3% every year, and the surrounding units at our building have exceded our monthly cost by several hundred dollars.  The sooner they can get rid of me the sooner they can jack up the price for the next victom...I mean Tenent.  I spent sunday draining tha water from the tank, and collected the fish and crabs, which I returned to the fish store for a credit, I donated my mushrooms, and Neon Gobies to my friend Jeff who has been running a very nice reef tank.  I couldn't get mad, I knew they weren't allowed, I thought I would try to get away with it as long as I could, had it for about 5 months, and I enjoyed every minute of it.  It looks like Im going to have to buy a place so I can do whatever I want with it.  I've been renting too long and Im tired of throwing my money away, so I have started looking for a single family house, or Townhome.  Ill keep you posted on what I find.
