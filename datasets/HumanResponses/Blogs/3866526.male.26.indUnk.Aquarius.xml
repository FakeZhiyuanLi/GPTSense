      It has now been two straight days of switching between Belle and Sebastian's "Tigermilk" and Van Halen's "1984" as the only records that I listen to in my Sony Psyc! Discman.  Weird Musical Taste or Bi-Polar Disorder?&nbsp; You decide!

      Just go see Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy.  When I'm not giggling, I'm speechless.  I haven't laughed that hard in the theater since the original Naked Gun.  That's all.

      Having lived in Allston for a year, I realize that I will never, ever, never, ever, never come close to not feeling screwed by the B-Line.  But, unlike my hopeless, beloved Red Sox, I finally got my small victory.  I got on a very crowded train to go home last night.  It was one of those deals where all the out-of-towners were standing in the first car when there was an open football field in the back.  So I struggle and fight my way through these idiots to freedom ... only to find myself surrounded by about 85 really loud high school kids in Sox shirts.  They're screaming, fighting, throwing gummi bears and generally acting like complete neanderthals.  I figured this would go on for the whole ride, and I'd have to use a paint-chipper to scrape the grime and tinnitus off.  (These are the things that happen on the B-Line - loud and raucous kids, shouting - it's like the official Short Bus of the city.)  Anyway, after one stop, one of the kids comes over to me.  Uh-oh.  KID:  "Hey, nice watch."  Then he threw a gummi bear at me and it stuck to my knee.  Soooo ... just to show them who's boss in this town, (are you ready?  This is what I did...) I put on my Sony Psyc! Discman, and I listened to "Get Me Away From Here I'm Dying" by Belle and Sebastian 12 times in a row! Without interruptions!  Ha ha!!!!  (I know, I know.  I can't believe it either.)  Take that, B-Line!

      When you read my astoundingly awesome blog, please keep in mind that even though it is written in the voice of ESPN reporter Sal Paolantonio, that  it is still meant to be read in the voice of Dave Coulier doing an impression of Popeye .  (I can't stress this enough.  This astoundingly awesome blog works two ways, people.  Snap to it!)  Also, all punctuation sounds like the sound effect from America's Funniest Home Videos when some jackass gets hit in the junk.  Enjoy, everybody!  Blog, blog, blogamundo!  Do-do-do-do-do....

      Ah, jokes.  Eh?    I actually quit smoking on December 22, 2001 at 4:35 pm EST while eating a cheese sandwich and watching the Saved By The Bell episode where the gang heads to the mall to get U2 tickets.   See?  I remember the exact date, time and Saved By The Bell episode, therefore it's true.  Rule of three wins again!  Yay comedy!  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to ebay to check on my birkenstocks.

      2 Reasons:  1. I just quit smoking.  2. I just quit not blogging.  Please help me before I buy sandals.

      I think I've had it with eggplant.  No more eggplant.
