      Little kids are funny.  So innocent and open to saying whatever is on their minds.  I often hear about these kids' pets.  Usually they are dogs or cats, but sometimes there are snails, frogs, and other random reptiles.   Two instances of little kids doing cute things come to mind from today.   Before we open usually we (the employees that is) are busy doing things like sweeping, mopping, and feeding animals.  During this period the gate between the mall and the store is about 75% down (leaving about three feet of it open still).  A woman and her about 3 year old daughter were waiting for the store to open, and the girl was getting impatient.  All of a sudden, she crawled under the gate and started staring at the puppies.  Her mother seemed worried, but we assured her it was fine.  The girl seemed totally at ease with leaving her mother's side and walking into a strange place.   And a very short story consisting mainly of a quote of a little boy.  I was holding a Chihuahua and going to put him back in his crate until a little boy caught my eye.  I said, "Do you want to pet the puppy?".  He nodded.  I held the puppy near him and he started asking me questions; he asked the following:  "What kind of dog is he?" "How old is he?" "Isn't he cute?" "Is he afraid of bears?"  To which I paused and said, "Uh probably".

      Once in a while a puppy will get sick right when someone buys it, and if that happens, the customer has the option to return the puppy and get a full refund.  This happened last week to a Soft Coated Wheaton Terrier.   The man and woman who bought the dog came in to the store with the dog in a crate, the man very upset.  He said, "If the dog showed even the slightest bit of improvement (using his fingers as an example of how slight) we would have kept him".  The man said the vet diagnosed the puppy with "acute pneumonia".  The register was busy for a good ten minutes, so this man and woman had to wait until that was done.  The man's face was bright red, the woman crying.  During this time, plus the time it takes to do the dog return, the puppy was in the crate next to us.  Now I'm not a vet.  I certainly do not claim to be anything but a guy with (some) common sense.  I also have seen a dog with non-acute pneumonia, and it's a terrible terrible sound.  Coughing all the time, and other wacky sounds coming from the dog's respiratory system.  This wheaton terrier with "acute pneumonia" made not a sound the entire time.  Not one cough, not one wheeze, nothing at all.  The man and woman left, and the dog was taken into the back (since a returned dog must be isolated for 3 days).  We inspected the dog a bit closer, and there was nothing wrong.  This dog is fine.   We could be wrong, but it seems pretty unlikely that a dog with acute pneumonia would look fine and not make any strange sounds at all for an extended period of time.  It's funny since the man said he would have kept the dog if the dog showed improvement.   Of course the dog didn't show any improvement, the dog is fine!  A healthy dog can't show improvement.    This brings up a much larger issue of a number of dogs being returned for being sick and they turn out to be fine.  It seems distinctly likely that vets (now I don't mean the majority by any means, but a few) are purposely diagnosing a healthy pet store dog with an illness because the vet objects to pet stores in the first place.  I can't confirm this for sure, but I do know that perfectly healthy dogs have been returned because they were "sick".

      In a way a pet store is like an airport.  If you say the word "bomb" in an airport, you're in handcuffs.  If you say the word "killed" in a pet store, customers are all over you.  Even a phrase as innocent sounding as a puppy "going home" (meaning being sold) will occasionally alarm a customer to an insane degree.  As such, I once got another employee in trouble after she repeated a joke I made in the store.  A common question is, "What happens to the puppies if no one buys them?".  After hearing this question many times, it gets kind of annoying.  The real answer is the price goes down until someone buys the dog.  Very simple.  Well one friday afternoon someone asked that question, and was told the answer.  After that customer left, we started joking about the worst possible things that might happen.  A few comments about Chinese restaurants were introduced, and then I said, "We have a big grinder out back, makes things easy".  I just said this to the employees, and there was much laughter.  I got a few funny looks from customers who overheard, but no big deal.  Two days later I was not there and one of my co-workers repeated the comment.  One customer was terribly offended, and went so far as to call the manager of our store, then from there call the district manager, etc.  I felt kind of bad, but hey, it was funny.

      This is a story from months ago.  Legendary at our store.  It will be long, go get a drink, I'll wait. ... There are two basic jobs at our store.  One is to clean the kennels in the morning (HARD CORE), and the other is everything else (sales, cleaning small animals & reptiles, etc).  While the kennel job does not require excessive intelligence (no offense to those who do it), it does basically require a loss of the sense of smell.  Anyway we hired this young woman, in her early twenties.  I shall refer to her as LBG (Lab Block Girl).  During LBGs second week or so, she had a Yellow Lab running around out back.   Now the back contains food for all the small animals; one of these types of food is called "Lab Blocks", which is food for rats and mice.  "Lab" in this case stands for "Laboratory" of course, as laboratories would feed these blocks to their test subjects.  LBG is in back with our kennel manager at the time, call her KM.  LBG looks around for some treat to give the Yellow Lab, and sees the bin that says, "Lab Blocks".  A conversation ensues:  LBG: "I'm giving the Yellow lab some lab blocks, ok?" KM: "Uh no, actually the lab blocks are for mice and rats" LBG: "Are you sure?  They say 'Lab Blocks' on them, and that dog is a Lab."  KM then has to leave the back immediately because she is laughing so hard.  LBG ended up having some disagreements with various members of the staff, and stopped working at the store.   The day after she was gone, she called the store and proceeded to talk in broken Spanglish, claming she was Portuguese.    Some people are just nuts.

      We've got an English bulldog right now (12 wks old), and he is so spoiled.  Contrary to what most think, it is quite possible (and all too easy) to spoil a dog, even if that dog is at a pet store.  We tried to clip his nails today, and it was quite an ordeal.  It's a two person job.  One to hold him, one to do the clipping.  Knowing almost nothing about clipping nails (and black nails at that), I am the holder.   This dog has an absolute conniption fit every time you reach for one of his nails.  He made unholy sounds.  Not like the Chi-Chi made, but still quite startling.  We had the entire store staring in horror at us, with looks on their faces like, "Why are they torturing that poor puppy?".  The sound can be best described as whacking a tazmanian devil with a ferret.  A barrage of sqeaking, gurgling, and shreiking.  We had people walking outside the store stare in to see what was going on.  A mother had her crying 12 year old daughter in her lap because of this terrible noise.  It was that freaky.  All nails were cut with much fanfare, but no injury to anyone in the end.  Cute little girl story time.  Pull up your pillows.  A 6 year old girl walked up to me today and said, "Can you take a puppy out?  I like puppies.".  I told her I was busy, but when I was done I would take a puppy out.  She politely thanked me.  When I was done with what I was doing, I pulled out a mini dachsund puppy.  She ran over to me and said, "Oh, but I wanted a small puppy.  This puppy is too big.  Can't you put that one back and take out the beagle?".  I point out the beagle is actually bigger than the dachsund, and she just smiles.  I bend over to pet the dog, and she nestles herself close to me, almost like I'm her father.  We talk briefly about her pet rabbit, and the puppy, then she says, "Can I sit on your lap?".  "Uh, ok" says I.  So this little girl I don't know sits on my leg for a minute or so.  Her mother sees her and sighs.  I told her it was fine.  What a cute kid.

      A number of notable things happened today: A Pomeranian was dropped, a Chihuahua lost her mind, and an old lady corrupted the mind of a small girl.  First the Pom.  About 10 week old female was being played with in a room, when we heard crying.  We went over, and the two ladies had let her walk on the bench.  She took a flying leap off, and landed hard on the floor.  She was cuddled for awhile, then put back.  An hour later, another customer was playing with her and she had trouble turning around.  When she tried, her back right paw seemed to buckle and she fell over.  She was in no visible pain, it was just like she lost her balance.  The vet will check her soon.  Early in the day, we were doing normal morning stuff (sweeping, mopping, feeding) when we heard a dog screaming.  This was no ordinary screaming.  It sounded like someone was beating this dog continuously, one of the most awful sounds ever heard by man.  It was the Chi Chi, who up until now has been the sweetest and cutest chi chi I've seen at our store.  We opened the crate and she just screamed and the look on her face was of pure terror.  Upon trying to pet her, she snapped at us in a very aggressive manner.  The vet was immediately called, and said she had an "altered mental state due to hypoglycemia".  On rare occasion small dogs (Chi Chis, Yorkies, etc) will refuse to eat, and their blood sugar levels will drop to the point where they can hardly walk.  Apparently this chi-chi reacted in a "losing her mind" kind of way.  She seems to be doing better now though.  Lastly, an older woman came in today with a little girl.   They walked around the store briefly, and left.  As they were leaving, the older woman said, "Animals should not be kept in cages.  Keeping animals in cages is a sin.  The people who work here are going to hell.".  No kidding.  Chalk up another small child being corrupted by a (very religous apparently) ignorant person.  About 80% of the world is going to hell according to this woman, so it's going to be a busy place.  See you there.

      After working at this place for the past nine months, I've seen alot of random people claiming to be experts.  Many of them have the puppies best interests in heart, which is sweet, but they always think dogs are dying.  If a dog isn't staring at the customer and barking, the dog must be about to die (or gravely ill).  The first instance of this is the concept of dreaming dogs.  As they dream, they move around some amount (varies puppy to puppy).  Perfectly normal.  However, to the random customer it looks like the dog is having seizures.  Here is a typical situation:  Customer: "Excuse me, but I think that dog is having seizures" Me:  "It's ok, he's just dreaming.  When dogs dream, sometimes they move around like that." Customer: "Oh, ok.  Thanks." Me: "Yep." Customer, 15 seconds later: "Excuse me, but I really think that dog is having seizures." Me: "No, really, the dog is fine."  Customer still has very concerned look on face.  I walk into the room and make some noise.  A brief pause, the dog wakes up and looks at me inquisitively.  I walk back out of the puppy room.  Customer: "Oh, ok, I guess you were right."  Similarly, dogs (along with most notably ferrets) can sleep in weird positions, and it has nothing to do with being deathly ill.  Some puppies sleep with one paw outside the crate, some on their backs with their legs spread (male dogs especially, oddly), some with their necks at nearly right angles against the side of the crate, and one notable puppy with her legs straight up into the air lying on her back.   There have also been a number of customer comments concerning sleeping ferrets.  Ferrets have insanely flexible bodies, and this is quickly evident if you've ever played with one.  Most of the comments come when a ferret is sleeping with just its head drooping into its food bowl.  I admit, it looks bad.  But the ferret is fine!  Most pet stores will let you hold a ferret, so just ask to hold the one sleeping with its head in the food bowl, and you'll see too.

      This is what the yougins call a "blog".   I made this mainly as an archive of stuff that's happened where I work.  As controversial as it is, I work at a pet store (I also write computer software, but sadly stories from that job don't have the same excitement).  And yes, we sell puppies.   I do not want to start some stupid crap about how evil pet stores are.  The store I work at (which I will for now keep anonymous) actually cares about its animals; they are treated very well, and with much love.  Since most people already hate pet stores, there will certainly be stories about insane, ignorant, and just plain weird customers.  There will be stories about cute things animals do,  and strange things employees do.  Pictures will be posted probably when I feel so inclined.   Stories may become more interesting if you have knowledge of what a dog/puppy looks like.  Short description of a puppy:  small, four legged creature that tends to omit a barking noise, best represented in english as "bark" or "ruff".  Craps/pees alot.
