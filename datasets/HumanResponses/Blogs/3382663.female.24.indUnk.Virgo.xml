      My life in America is quite a good journey I guess. As I look back on my life here, it has been really hard from time to time. But it has been a real blessing for me to be here. It is obvious if I examine daily life.  Let me think about my daily schedule today.  "GOING TO GYM..." As soon as I woke up today, I went to gym. I spend for about an hour there. I like to go there to run. It makes me feel tired but good.  If I'm in Korea, I will also go to gym or swimming pool for exercise. That means my life here getting comfortable. That is why I do something that I would do in my country.  "Friends" I cleaned up all my room and it became a new room (?).. hihi~ When I cleaned my room, I realized that I have so many stuffs  that I did not have when I got here at first. It is partly because I bought many things,  and also many people gave me some stuffs for gifts. I have gotten many good friends. That means my life here is meaningful.  This afternoon, I drove to the church that I am working. "DRIVE...." This is also new thing that I started here. Although I had an experience to drive in Korea,  I did not really expect that I am going to drive in U.S.A this much soon. I'm not a good driver, but I feel like I'm getting better.  "Working..." Working at church is evidence that I'm adjusting life here well. I'm working at Korean-American church in Chicago as a children minister. There are many challenging things for me. First, English, English, English... The language problem is really big deal for me. English is not my first language which makes feel uncomfortable  to have a conversation with my children at church. But, of course, this is not the major reason. I guess we, both children and I, need try out to understand each other continually.  "Writing journal..." When I got here at first, I could not write in English like this. This means that I'm doing good job to live here in America, my third country.  Today.. I'm living at another country. It's becoming part of my life. I know that this is going to be a small step  to understand myself, people, and the world. Today I’m living with hope Today I’m learning many things. Today I’m thinking about tomorrow, the future, the hopeful future.

      Thought about "Yesterday".  I'm kind of a person that thinks about past a lot. Many people might say that do not look back but just keep going. However, for me looking back my life is the best way to keep going my healthy life. Today cannot be exist without yesterday. But we seem to forget about yesterday often times. Yesterday literarly means the day before,  but what I mean here is not just like that. We always keep in mind what have we done, what have our ancester done. Is it any good or bad? If it is good, then we have to think about how to keep it continually. If it is bad, we have to find out what is the best way to fix the problem.  Think about yesterday. What have you done??
