      well i woke up early and i went to church woohoo sike.  it wasnt fun cause i was still asleep at church.  then i went to circut city and bought taking back sunday's cd.  its good. then i went to shelby's house and hung out there for a bit and then went to folly again with him and t-mob.  it was pretty cool except that shelby sucks at surfing, but i dont blame hime because he has a shiitty board and a the waves were really shitty.  so i guess hes ok.  well then we went to chris's house and ate a bunch of food for dinner.  finally we just ended up hanging out at tyler's house it was pretty cool.  also i didnt run today, but that was somewhat expected.

      well as you can tell from the title i didnt run again but no biggy i guess.  thankfully, teusday i will get down to business and run no matter what, none of this i may moy not run shit.  today i woke up early and went to get my senior picture.  hopefully my hair was cool haha.  they put you in all these gay poses that are the farthest from natural as string beans and milk.  yea a shitty metaphor but oh well.  then i went to the pimp speaker store downtown with my dad to look at the front projection tv, very nice.  then i went to shelby's house and he took a surfboard from felicia, i dont really know her but shelby does i guess, and i took chris's board down to folly and went surfing for like two hours.  the waves sucked but it was fun.  chris was a douche (spelling) and didnt come because he had just woken up.  eventually we came back and went to shelby's house where we hung out for a while.  he played some xbox live and talked to the people he was playing against, it was hilarious.  chris and tyler came over as well.  then we went to see shrek 2, it was pretty funny.  my favorite part was when they had a spoof on cops and they found the cat with catnip on him and he was like i swear it is not mine.  oh yea me and shelby decided to eat at sonics and completely out of the blue i see this girl i hadnt seen since like beginning of sophmore year and she had my cell number so we decided to go to the beach with her tommorow, her name is kim.

      finally fucking school is over and it ended like a bitch cause i had to take that gay religion exam.  i shouldnt have had to take it, o well it's not like it was life scarring or anything just put me in a bitchy mood.  after school i followed will to charlotte's house and other people came over including but not limited to chris, bennet, lauren, will, brittney, ken, and john.   overall it was a pretty fubn time we wrestled in the pool and shit and went to the beach for like 45 minutes.  we went to try and see if brock could surf...it was way to choppy and the tides were crazy.  we got in the water and like five minutes we were like a mile down the beach, well not that far but close.  then we went back to charlotte's and got our stuff and left.  me and chris then ventured to his house where we met shelby and eventually paul came.  we had more pizza for dinner and various food stuffs.  at about 9 o'clock dave (the college guy from track) called paul and invited us to The Day After Tommorow.  overall it was good i guess, a little too much of end of the world rip offs, ou know what i mean.  Artic wolves in NYC, Swells as high as the Statue of Liberty, and KILLER ICE that can kill you in like 2 seconds.  overall a good movie that was a little over the top.  also, the south wwill rise again because we did not freeze haha.  well obviously i did not run today, but i did a lot of swimming, but that doesnt really count.  til the morrow.

      well my back stil hurts form yesterday at the gym and i have concluded i have some sort of muscle spasm because i did not warm up but went straight to lifting weights, what a dumb idea.  well tommorow is my religion exam and i have discovered that if i get a zero on the exam i can still get out of that class with an 80.1.  but knowing me i will still at least try on the exam.  today i had english and it was hard as shit.  i really messed up the gramma because me no speak or wrote good.  well i doubt ill go running tommorow because i might not come home til late.  i will run saturday before i get my senior photo taken.  also in other news the coach from moltonborough, what a hard word to spell, wrote back on helping me train this summer so i dont do what i did last summer and run like 10 min miles the whole time and although it did help i could have done more, alot more. well wish me luck on the religion final.

      well im back and here goes my two days  tuesday i took my physics exam which i feel i did not do that badly on in the a.m. and then went home.  i had some sort of cold or allergy problem that prevented my breathing through the nose because it was so runny and i had a headache and therefore felt like shit pretty much the whole day, including during my exam.  anyways i came home and just sort of huing around and went to eat with my parents and what not.  i stayed up late because i exempted both my exams on wednesday.  wednesday has been a slow day.  i still didnt run because my nose is still pretty stuffed up.  i just go tback from the YMCA and liftnig weights.  a problem developed in a sort of cramp/chalie horse/pulled muscle feeling.  im not sure what it is but i will take some advil in hopes i will be fine tommorow.  tommorow i have my english exam with that dumb bitch ms horton.  she is a horrible teacher...wouldn't you feel like a failure if you had to write on 17 of 44 progress reports in danger of failing for the year and have only one person exempt out of two classes.  she is the worst teacher ever.  well i guess ive studied quite a bit but it is a lot of stuff so wish me luck.

      today was a half day at school and the rest of the day i have spent studying, well sort of.  after school let out at noon me, shelby, and corey went to bessingers to eat.  it was pretty good and i got a hamburger even though it was a BBQ place.  then ian and sean showed up becuase apparently the line at chic-fil-a was out the door and into the street.  then chris and kraig showed up because whoever they were going to lunch with couldnt go bc they had to go pick up their cousin or something. when i got home i fell asleep for about 2 hours bc i guess i was tired.  then i studied for physics for about an hour and now i just went running.  i ran 3.25 miles on the trail behind my house in 25 minutes.  it was pretty good but not anything amazing. i was thinking i was only going to have to take 2 exams and then it turns out i missed religion by .5 points.  i had an 89 for the year and i need an 89.5.  i about decked mr provost in the face.  that really pissed me off considering last week he told me i had exempted.  well i guess i could be taking all 7 but seriously mr provost give me a fucking break. tommorow i have physics.

      friday consisted of no running because immediately after school i went directly to shelby's house and didnt arrive home until about midnight.  We actually spent most of the night at chris's trying to hook up his original nintendo and play old school games on it.  saturday i did run about 2.5 to 2.75 miles in 20 minutes to the YMCA to lift weights.  i didnt lift but a few weights because i was tired after running.  so i just called my mom to come and pick me up.  then i helped pick up the house for this party my parents were having.  after that i went to chris's house and ate dinner and what not.  shelby and tyler were also there.  i brought all my NES games and we beat Kirby's dream land in about 3 hours.  it was worth it because we saved dream land from the nightmare.  When i arrived home the people were still here and i ate some of the left over deserts.  Everyone finally left at about 215 am and i went to sleep at about 245.  sunday we all slept in til about 1200 and when we awoke we went almost immediately to the track banquet at BE.  it was pretty fun and the track scrapbook was pretty cool also.  I was dissapointed that the seniors did not do the paper plate awards because apparently people would cry about the awards which is total shit because they are meant to be in good fun.  last year i got the goofy award.

      I, Adam Smith, realizing im not a great runner, copying my cousin, in an attempt to become a better runner, am beginning a "blog" to keep track of my running and what not.  I guess it will be a record of the summer etc. and what i do for my running career.  I would like to begin by saying that I go to a 2AA school Bishop England High School, and that I was on the Varsity Team for both Cross Country and Track.  In cross country my PR is 19:57 and i was no. 7 on my team so obviously i went to state.  In track i ran on the 4x800 team, the mile and sometimes other events but nothing worth mentioning.  Well i will 400 hurdles, the 4x400 sometimes, and the 800 a few times. PR's  5000-19:57, 1600-5:20, 800-2:16(WOW...sike) no. 2 on the 4x800 team at lower state, 400-60.76 (4x400 split) and 400H-66 or 67 i dont rememeber.  As i said the boys XC team made it to state and came in 12th and the 4x800 team made it to lower state and came in fifth and failed to qualify by one place. I invite everyone to join and read as it will be an educational experience.  Today I ran 2.3 miles in 17 minutes wow that is really horrible but i havent run in 2.5 weeks. During those 2.5 weeks after failing to qualify for state, i have been lifting weights in an attempt to look buff and considering the weight has been going up, my body isnt really the type that looks buff.  Ill try anyway.  Anyways parkers coming over so check back later. Peace.

      well yesterday i called the coach and thankfully he knew who i was so i didnt have to explain, he said he would hok me up with a kid named chris so hopefully he'll call me soon.  we went to concord today and bought a new tv, and some dvds. the last 2 days i ran for 40  minutes so i felt really accomplished because ive run for that long vary rarely by myself. i think it had to do the fact that i chose 2 different routes, i just sort of made them up as i went.  well its been fun and hopefully this chris characterwill call someday.  alright bye.

      well  i went to work this morning and it turns out they didnt need me.  right now it is raining so ill run in a while.  no hurry though as long as i get out and do it.  yesterday we tried out the new wakeboard we got, it was damn fun.  later i watched adaptation and it was an awesome movie.  anyways ive been running about 4 miles a day and i need to up that a bit to 5 or 6 miles a day soon, maybe today.  anyways i dont have to work until thursday and i might lift some weights today.

      well im in new hampshire and hve been for about a week.  the week before this i went to cincinnati.  i didnt run at all in cincinnati except for the first night we were there.  it was a good time, saw a reds game, ate skyline chili, and went to king's island.  it was hellafun.  well we got to NH and ive been running since the day i got here.  yesterday, thursday instead of running i did spinning at the gym i joined.  it was pretty intense and i sweated alot.  also i found out that my body fat percentage is 5.2%, that is amazingly low and proves how fit i am.  benjamin had 6.4 % body fat, what a fat ass.  well today im just hanging around and will probably go swimming at some point.  hopefully the coach up here will e-mail me back so i dont have to keep running alone because it sucks day after day.  anyways off i go, the internet is hard to get here so i wont post everyday.

      monday i didnt do much in the sport of running but did have a fun time because i spent the night downtown at parker's grandparents  house, it was a pretty cool place and a pretty good time  tuesday was the first day of cross country training it was hot but not blistering, and there was no humidity so that was good. there was like 5 or 6 people there...me, BJ, brian, edmund, and carrie, and Dave, the college guy.  we ran 1 mile and then lifted wieghts.  coach colizzi was like nothing more than 8:30 for guys and nothing more than 9:30 for girls.  it was a breeze cause we ran it in about 6:30.  Edmund, the first year runner who is a senior is an animal and i had to keep up with him. then i went to chris's house and did the usual.  wednesday was an early day, i had to leave my house at about 5:55 am.  practice was aat 6:30 am so that we could beat the heat.  we ran 4 miles, we almost got to Mars, but not quite, then turned around.  we did it in about 30 minutes.  edmund again drug me and BJ around like he had been running forever.  after that i went home and wen tto sleep from about 9 until 12.  it turns out i dont need anything on my liscense, spelling is so far off, to make it a full one, and therefore i have my full license.  then i went to chris's house later and we played some ninja gaiden and 6 person halo.  it was pretty fun.

      well this morning i ran 5.5 miles with danielle.  she has just graduated from moltonborough high school and is going to UNH.  she was pretty good, and not too bad looking.  well whatever.  it was a pretty challenging run with a lot of uphill but it ended with an .8 mile downhill run.  the downhill was not too steep just long.  overall i felt pretty strong today except for the second mile in my left quad hurt again, i have to figure out what that is.  but after that i was fine.  then i went to work at the corner house again, whooptie shit.  well it was long because i was there for six hours.  i almost killed myself, well not really.  now im home and relaxing.  i had some oreos and milk an so now im set.  yesterday i ran the 4 mile loop up upper road and elmhill road, for some reason i like doing that.  well i got pulled over for my first time yesterday and was scared luckily i did not get a ticket.  it was mainly for my greenlights on the front of my car and for another reason which i am not going to go into becasue i dont know who reads this.  anyways i think im going to go night hiking tonight, it will be a new experience.  im going with kasey :), kelley, chris probably, and anyone else who comes.  well ill run tommrow seeing as i must run as much as possible because XC camp is in like 2 weeks and ive been slacking off.  well like danielle said, THE HILLS MAKE UP FOR IT. thats what i said.  HILLS are damn hard.

      well its been a pretty good couple of days.  the other day i ran to the karnans and back for a 3 mile hill course that is damn hard.  it was still pretty good though.  then this morning i went to the gym.  i realized that im just a beast and have an awesome body.  well i also pick up a check for $164.23, oh wait minus $28.36 for god knows what.  i mean what the fuck i dont need medicare...yet, or social security...yet.  well i guess it is for the best that i have that stuff.  oh yea and meals and meals tax, but i definetley ate my share of food this week.  enough for $10.80 at least.  the boat is back to normal, just a stupid ass old battery, oh well not a big problem, like the engine fell out.  that would suck.  well ill be back eventually to update. i forgot to mention ill be headed home 2 weeks from now to go to cross country camp in north carolina.  it should be exciting.

      well the past two days, july 6 and 7 i was in massachusetts at a dave matthews band concert on the 6 and it was AWESOME.  it was one of the best concerts ever.  anyways i obviously didnt run on either day.  right now im pretty damn tired.  well i also looked at holy cross and wheaton while in mass and they were both pretty nice.  i thiink i liked wheaton a little better but dont tell my mom that.  i dont really have much else to say except that the other day i drove the boat across the lake in the rain because it needed to be fixed.  well its ready today so at some point i have to go pick it up.  i feel like i need to run again soon, in other words later today.  well hopefully i will, i am on my way now to work out so well see.

      well i havent updated in a while because the internet is not right at my fingertips like it is at home.  well ive been having a good time recently.  running wise ive been doing about 4-5 miles a day and mostly making up courses as i go because its more fun that way, running and deciding to turn at any given moment onto any given road.  i went to a drive in movie theater with kelley, kasey, and chris.  ive never been to a drive-in seeing as i thought that they only exist in movies and in the television world.  well it was pretty fun and i had a real good time.  recently ive been working alot and got another pay check, but i probably wont spend it any time soon.  nothing really eventful has happened recently, im really stoked about the dave matthews concert on july 6, it is very soon and i cant wait.  also hopefully ill be able to go to a 311 concert later in july depending on if i have to work at night or not.  well  hopefully ill keep running enough to stay in better shape than most on the cross country team.  oh yes my left quad has been in paon when i run recently but im not sure why.  hopefully it will go away but if it doesnt im royally screwed.  it may just be do to a lack of stretching which i am asuming is the case alright hopefully i will updatge sooner than last time.

      what a way to cap off my day...about an hour ago i got a fucking speeding ticket, i am so pissed right now.  i was going 77 in a 55 in that stupid ass place where it changes from 65 to a fucking 55 at ashley phosphate on fucking I-26.  i hate cops.  at least the cop wasnt a hard ass.  oh yea and the thing that really pisses me off was that i  was in my moms god damn minivan.  i hate that peice of shit.  anyways my run today was good.  there is this new junior who was decent that moved here from brazil.  me, joey, roberto (the new kid), and will went out towards mars on ouur run and took a left at the first small hill.  well that is all i want to say reight now because i am so utterly pissed.

      well ive been back in SC for about two weeks now and it is hot as fuck here.  i havent updated mainly for two reasons, the first is that i am slack and the second is that when i tried the sight kept booting me off.  well anyways i am back. right when i  got back i went to cross country camp in the North Carolina mountains.  it was awesome.  good times hiking, rafting, rappeling, and building fires and of course playing frisbee.  that was a good week. atcamp we had a race of about 2 to 2.5 miles and i was the third best on the team behind BJ and Joey.  i was only about 10 seconds behind though in a time of 16:08 i think.   when i got back from that last sunday, monday morning i, chris, and peter went to the vans warped tour in charlotte.  we saw a bunch of good bands including but not limited to Rufio, Underoath, Taking Back Sunday, Flogging Molly, Story of the Year, Going nowhere, and probably some more that i cant remember.  the best was Story of the year.  then flogging molly.  overall though, it was an awesome day.  the next day practice began and we did about 2 long miles in that damned thing humidity.  i swear i could have taken a slice of the air and eaten it.  then we went swimming at bellinger.  wednesday we ran buildups.  my times were about 7:19 and 7:33ish.  then we hit the weght room.  thursday was about 4 miles in the hottest fucking day of the summer.  it was easily over 100 degrees outside.  well it is good for me to get accustommed to the heat again.  then we went swimming agian.  finally friday we played frisbee instead of running but it was hard core frisbee.  saturday i read alot and went to collateral (the ending sucked) then today just hung araound and went to chris's house.  we ate at hardee's.  i forgot to mention that Spiderman 2 and harold and kumar go to white castle are both great movies and i reccomend everyone go see them.
