      i am eminently capable--many skills but the best is learning quickly.  And the worst is an evaluating eye.  That's why i don't write: i never feel good enough about my words, even when they are good.  The best writing advice i've ever received was from a movie (first a book by Charles Willeford),  The Woman Chaser :  "All I know is that you have to write something, get anything on the page.  Then you can read it over and rewrite."  Something like that.  But i'm not trying to be a writer.  I'm not.  i'm trying to be me and--unfortunately--i feel as though i am succeeding.  Is this enough?  Is this all that i am?  What will i do, what will i do.  With any luck, not what i'm doing now.  So many little failures, many my own, belying my smiles and laughs.  So many chances, some foolishly ignored and others cruelly taken.  As my life and country songs converge, i can't help but feel... FUCKED.  And the image i've built up, the image agreed upon by so many--where did it diverge from whom i really am?  i remember: sleeping two-thirds the day away, and then sunshine and suntans and books well-read,  and then lost again.  Was it the Old Man's unnatural philandering?  Am i growing into Uncle Mike, the ubiquitous Crazy Uncle?  How much do i have to lose (both readings)?  How long can i let myself down.

      In my short time, i have become fascinated with food.  Of the few instinctive necessities for living, the act of eating has the greatest potential for enjoying the means, with the end naturally coming about from the act; in other words, one has to eat in order to live, and one can eat poorly or richly.  As a counterexample i posit excretion: a good shit is one in which nothing goes wrong--you cannot up the enjoyment, you can only minimize discomfort (eating a lot of fiber, for example).  The chemical reactions taking place within the body upon consumption of sustenance do not care if your cereal is stale, if your olive oil is extra virgin, if your corn meal is in tortilla or enchilada format.  Your tongue and its buddies, your nose and your jaw muscles do care.   [Granted: the reactions do care if your sugar is nothing but fructose corn syrup, and if your cereal is full of dyes and diglycerides.  A whole 'nother topic.]   My question: Why eat foods that do not satisfy your aesthetic when you do not have to?  Considerations of economics and geographics aside, why eat "bad" food when you can eat "good" food?  i do not have an answer for that question posed to myself.  Many plants and animals have been domesticated in the past 10,000 years, to the betterment and detriment of humanity  [another topic] .  Cows, wheat, gourds, rice, chickens, llamas, and others that we don't eat or use anymore.  All were domesticated--their evolution husbanded by humans in order to maximize their benefits to and for our consumption--because they could be, not because of their aesthetic values.  From a mechanical/utilitarian perspective, i can see, all domestication is beautiful--but rare is the utterance "Pigs are gorgeous."  Many people don't even appreciate the taste of pork--crazy, i know, but true--though it has nutrients the body wants.  But we've come to a point in our scientific advancement where one does not have to eat pork if one does not want to, because the end of eating can be accomplished by eating other things, whether attractive or ugly, delicious or nasty.  But where do the twain meet, what food is easy on the eyes  and  simply good and good for you?  Sunflowers  are  gorgeous.  i find those large blossoms on their stately stalks to be the most beautiful biomass dedicated to human consumption.  The seeds are very healthy--the shells great for cleaning teeth--and the oil pressed is healthy as well.  The salt added after roasting is necessary--especially if you eschew processed foods loaded with salt--and, to my tastes, delicious.  It is for these reasons that i hope someday to harvest my own field of sunflowers, worn out after following the sun's path during a hot summer, and selling at reasonable cost "Anthony's Organic Roasted Sunflower Seeds w/ Kosher Salt".  It is in ways like this that i hope to continue my enjoyment of my basest needs.

      And so in my 27th year i continued through the dark forest.  Caught in a loop with ends in Berkeley and Sacramento, i'm once again unemployed (how unattractive that sounds!).  This time after one single day of floor training at Roseville's Old Spaghetti Factory, employment at which--for better and worse--offended too many of my sensibilities; basically, it was this: i cannot serve food that i do not enjoy, even when practically penniless.  It bothers me that i cannot sell out even when i want to.  But there's more: Tyler practically yelled at me for "wasting" my brain at such locations, before recommending an Elephant Bar at which his friends work.  And he's right (about the brains), but how to proceed?   urlLink McGeorge , UOP's respectable 3rd tier law school in Sacramento, has rolling admissions, a safe bet for a Cal alumnus with a 167 LSAT--but what do i do for the next five months?  There do not seem to be many opportunities, but i'm looking.  But she keeps me shamed into focus: Thank you, Sarah, for stoking my ambissions and salving the pains of my failures.  i want to be better because of and for you.  Next stop:  urlLink Sacramento Natural Foods Cooperative .  i do care greatly about good food and cooperative businesses.  With luck they may have a bagging position for an ideological foodie.

      US soldiers mistreating Iraqi prisoners?  Not surprisingly, it is so.  The photographs recently aired on "60 Minutes II" (perhaps the worst title for a news program, the suffix beating out the utter banality of "Investigative Reports") prove what any one of us who have been fighting cognitive dissonance should know: Our military forces are not the professional, ethical body as portrayed by, well, anyone in power.  Naturally, like the officer who documented these abuses, many uniformed representatives of American Power are fine people.  But many are not.  The fact that the abuses took place within Abu Ghraib prison, where many of the rape rooms to which President Bush refers were located, is both poignant and appropriate.  Abu Ghraib, like Evin prison outside of Tehran, was and is a symbol of former President Hussein's outrageous abuses--the metaphysical locus of the prior regime's worst atrocities against their Sunni Arab brethren as well as the subaltern Kurds and Shi'ites.  Ostensibly a convenient (re)use of existing infrastructure, the US's co-opting of the physical prison is horribly foolish, literally placing the US military in the position which former President Hussein's security forces held: Incarcerating dissident Iraqis, torturing dissident Iraqis.*  Towards the end of "Michael Collins", the film about the fight for and founding of the Republic of Ireland with Liam Neeson as the eponym, the Union Jack is lowered from whatever government building (was it the Castle?) and the new Irish Republic flag is hoisted.  Nothing really changes.  When the Goths overran Rome in the Fifth Century, Rome did not fall into darkness, giving up all Europe to the illiterati.  In fact, the successive Gothic kings assumed the decadent mantle of their Roman predecessors, carrying on.  The structures of oppression are exactly that, and it is never surprising when the supplanting power inherits the ideals--wedded to the structure--of the previous power.  After revolutions, in which the supplanting power is necessarily native, the new governments are often nominally divorced from the previous government, exemplified by retaining the term "revolution" in the official name and retaining the image of militarism (ostensibly against the previous government), such as the Revolutionary Government of Iran and Fidel Castro's uniform.  But without dismantling the existing infrastructure of oppression, the tendency towards creeping remains, creeping oppression by the powers, creeping indignation by the people.  Reza Shah built--and filled--Evin prison long before the Revolution.  It is in everyone's best interest that the US scrap Abu Ghraib, recycling the salvagables and such.  Build a new prison somewhere else.  How much of a publicity coup would that be?  How much respect would that win the Occupation from Iraqis and Arabs worldwide?  Fuck the pragmatic course of putting Iraqis back in the prison, because the pragmatism is certainly an illusion--and, i hope to dog,  not  a red herring.  Because if the US occupied Iraq in order to colonize it, then the despicable actions of soldiers from a supposedly-civilized nation are completely appropriate to that end.  Scare the natives into submission, and what better locale than one infused with decades of the most heart-wrenching cries, the blood of thousands of innocents, the broken dignity of men and women and children, flayed flesh, scorched flesh, severed flesh, tears and teeth, the piss and shit that runs down your legs when your throat is throttled.  i do not believe in ghosts.  If i did, however, and if they could act upon the physical world, i would not be surprised if their message to the US troops who replaced the Ba'athists would echo that Navy bomb, readied to drop on Afghanistan:  urlLink http://bushspeaks.com/img/fag_bomb.jpg   * i use "dissident" as a value-neutral term, denoting a (perceived) opposition to the current power.

      What is the appeal of self-destruction?  The big gun, i suppose: Self-destruction is art.  It's beautiful--living rather quickly, dying at an early age, a comely cadaver... .  A firework flash takes the breath away; a 15-watt eco-bulb burning, at best banal.  Like driving the lane--a spurt of sport--taking the contact and trying, trying to jam it in.  And then on your back, surprised,  resigned, the release of so much steam--respite.  Unfortunately, the luck of the artist is not pegged to chemical dependence, it's a spike in the graph.  A burp from your tupperware, gasping, needing to be heard.  Sometimes you just toss out the funky food.  Sometimes it  becomes , a transitive from within, an intransitive from without.  Beer, wine, vinegar, fishsauce, garum, sauerkraut, kimchee; apotheosis, deification, the Infinite.  Art is not always for the patient.  Sometimes a catalyst--some yeast, some salt, some vinegar--transforms the ugly to the beautiful.  More accurately, the useful to the more useful.  The hyper of the above foodstuffs is informative--> cabbage (lively and moribund) pickled/fermented becomes sauerkraut/kimchee, adding staying power.  Grape juice?  Has nothing on the shelf-life--or mystery--of wine.  Chris Farley will always be known as the Funny Fat Man from the 90s, David Spade will fade into syndication.  And self-immolation is no longer my thing.  The special (pertaining to species) benefits no longer obtain: i need look no farther for a mate, so the advantages of self-denial (or, as appropriate, self-indulgence) are wasted.  Ideology, and its concomitant (may i coin?) eigen-negation, still can display my stubborn refusals to do what is expedient for myself instead of Universally Right, thus hinting strongly at a selflessness that i may apply beneficially to my love object-subject.  But it salves only now the Princess Butterfly, from the Valley, and not even that much.  In other words, i have grown up.  Mostly.  The smaller gun (though at no cost to efficacy): Trapped!  Without an escape route.  Without a plan, design, future.  "Word acrobatics performed without harness or net, I'm so full of shit."  Not unfair, as criticism goes.  While away the time, burn that too-short wick, hope that something--ANYTHING AT ALL!!!--happens.  Make a goal for yourself and achieve it.  Sometimes you get so alone, but don't hold your bottled brethren to the same standards--they're always hanging out, though you may not always be on the List.  Just bide your time, shuffling from hole to hole, and maybe Jack Nance will rifle through your Life to your advantage.  But i would not wait on that, Mr. Chenowski.  [And now, in chorus]: I've got so much to offer.  Every moment unrecognized is a novel never written, a song not sung, a canvas untouched, a memory.  And memories are worth only so much.  And maybe less, if you can keep them.  History is written by the winners, they say, but who wins?  And who never played in the first place... ?  *   *   *  Even more personally, i'm not looking for It.  i'm not striving, nor starving.  i'm living in a whence-removed world.  And who cares?  Who heeds Dunne's call?  Does it matter whether i have health insurance?  Well, my world is functionally rather small anyway, so i should simply keep my eyes on the horizons, steering toward the lumps as they rise.  But why ignore the peaks at hand?  To complete the lyric, "but I will remain until this self-awareness fades, 'til I defeat the purpose of this soapbox that you've made."  Take heart whenever you can, it's not always easy to find.

      But first, a side note: i am now the 35,000,001st American living with tinnitus.  For a week now, there has been an incessant, unwavering ring in my left ear.  i also feel that, in negative compensation for the ring, i've functionally lost a little hearing--though unexpected sounds (cars driving by, restaurants, music...) raise my hearing in that ear, and with that my ring.  i haven't been listening to music, i've been quiet and submissive, sleep is not consistent but ganj helps.  i may have to live with it, give up the music arts for the plastic arts.  Or words.  *   *   *  And speaking of, how 'bout those shrouded coffins?  Nothing like the poignancy of the remains of men and women who died--most certainly a painful death--for some random reason or another.  The poise of the marine guard flanking the ten or so stainless steel caskets, impeccable United States of America flags on each, the poise was magnificent.  This honor--this amazingly egalitarian ceremony of honor--to each dead soldier nomatter what branch of service, this beautifully anonymous process is literally enshrined at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, flame burning perpetually.  These soldiers died as they worked and fought, in indistinguishable uniforms reifying their accepted placement in a grand process (in most cases  for  their country).  So, when White House spokesman Trent Duffy says, "In all of this, we must pay attention to the privacy and to the sensitivity of the families of the fallen, and that's what the policy is based on and that has to be the utmost concern," in explaining the enforcement of the Pentagon ban on coverage of the return of war-dead from overseas, i gotta wonder.  A certain Ms. Silicio worked for a contractor in Kuwait, doing something in airplanes transporting coffins back to Dover Air Force Base, the longtime point-of-entry for dead US servicefolk.  She took a shot--camera-wise--of the flag-draped coffins and it ended up in the Seattle Times.  She was fired.  But--the point is--how was the privacy of the families of the dead compromised?  On what day was that photograph taken?  Which flight?  Among the bereaved, is there a bill of lading for that shipment circulating?  Cross-checked with departure schedules and time-changes?  Verified by concerned witnesses of their own mortality, who shepherded their brothers' and sisters' remains back home, thinking "There, but for the grace of God, go I"? NO! The privacy of the family is ensured by the anonymity of the process--no names are stenciled onto the flags in cholo-style "Old English" script.  It is every grieving family's son or daughter in one of those coffins, and the dead are our own too.  Soldiers obviously treat their own dead with sanctity and care, and that care is afforded every soldier; war is a jerk, but honor is honor.  i like the photographs--they keep it real.  *   *   *  What happened to Dennis Kucinich?  Whe did the press stop covering him six months ago?  i really like the guy.  He's going to be played by Steve Buscemi in  Secondary Colors  and he's going to be radical!  Representative Kucinich is amazing: that a man that kooky-looking could be so positive!  And he looks like the guy in  urlLink Red Meat !  And--of course--i have great respect for his socio-politico-economics.  Universal healthcare?  Check.  Increased US  participation  in the international arena?  Ditto.  Dismantiling the military-industrial complex (of which we were warned by valedicting President Eisenhower, remember)?   BAM!!!   And that's why i voted for him on 2 March, here in California.  Both he and the Reverend Sharpton should nail some planks for the DNC's fall platform, in my opinion.  Hell, they should host a talkshow together!  Al could be the smooth-talking main host quipping and jabbing, and quirky Dennis doing color-commentary (odd) and fact statements and such.  Dog, that would be great.  But what i'm saying is, let's hear some more from the guy.  On the local NPR i caught him, sick in Hawai'i and flight delayed, drop some science and economics.  Great hippie fare, i ate it right up.  Hey, i think i hear the 'phone ringing... .

      Say what you will--for i know i have--about the stultifying effects of modernization, the anaesthesia of modernity, the banality of the modern.  Say it, but praise the process for clean water.   Of dog and man  Clean, reliable and clean water is perhaps the simplest proof (still short, in my estimation) of the existence of a benevolent God.  Knowing that i--and any number of millions of people in many locales--can safely assume that the water flowing from the tap will not harm me; that is an expression of the highest goal of social organization: to provide every member of the community with the basic necessities of living.  Would that we could all realize that health care is of similar consideration.   One last round for all my friends  Water, clean and reliable and ubiquitous, though conservation is paramount.  While enjoying the benefits of constant access to clean water, society should set a task for its experts: achieve an understanding of earth's most precious resource and its role in the earth's entire ecology, so that we may best husband it.  Both eyes to the future, as once lost, it cannot be reclaimed.  As with gasoline, which fuels an infrastructure that should hang a left towards creating a new infrastructure, one not dependent on the dirty and dwindling petroleum supply, while there's still gas in the tank.   Down the drain  Things are likely to get uglier in certain places on earth.  Occupied Palestine is in a bad spot due to Israel making its desert bloom.  Turkey lies upstream from Jordan.  Africa.  The dwindling Aral Sea, now Stain, festering with the USSR's graveyard of chemical tests on a  former  island, Sakhalin, a  windwhipped former  island.  The Pentagon's doomsday office published a report detailing how global warming events could, within 50 years, alter world weather patterns in such a way as to necessitate massive steps towards martial law in order to protect United States borders from migrating, starving peoples of the earth.  Hm.  Could?  Owing to the gravity, we might want to keep this scenario in mind.   Resources not too wasted  But not to forget clean water's history to our peoples.  In the West, clean water was scarce when people became communal, poo and nascent agriculture poisoning the streams.  So the grape, and the barley and hops (and salt, dear salt!), and the fermentation: a clean source of potable water ( vodka  is the Russian diminutive of  voda , water).  Noah, according the the book, was the first vintner.  Either way, Lot was wasted when his daughters straddled him in that pimped-out cave.  The fact is, up until the 18th century, alcoholic brews were the only reliable source of clean water, keeping the West in a constant, if mild, state of inebriation until we learned microbiology, or something (funny: alcohol is an Arabic word because it was North African Moors who first distilled alcohol in the 9th century, disconcerting considering the Islamic injunction against the grape--but Muslims also wash their arms face and nostrils before praying--associate!).  In the East, some people lack a gene that produces an enzyme speeding the metabolization of alcohol, but Hey! Let's boil some water for tea!  Tea is great stuff.  i mean, really great.   Lack-rymose  So drink wine, shower with friends, make coffee, boil some basmati.  Be thankful for the water, reliable and clean and there for all the right reasons.  Don't misuse it, not for the wrong reasons.  Resist notions of giving control away to ogres who do not understand its true significance: a sacred, priceless structure--no moneychangers in dog's house.  And appreciate what we have, for it may not always be with us.

      Yes, i still love the Word, and the Word is in lyrics.  i take serious satisfaction in well-written words.  As we all know, lyrics in popular music are not often a focus of hard work and skill, ruining a good structure by half-assing the cap.  Some musicians can compose an edifice so beautiful that it does not matter, or does flatter, the sagging lines expressed above the music.  Others make it so tall, hiding the words in the clouds.  Others do it all, as The Streets does.  *   *   * 2002's "Original Pirate Material" is--and this needs to be said outfront--England's "Marshall Mathers LP", trading Detroit and LA for Birmingham and Manchester, in both music and content.  What they have in common is an approach to flow remarkable for sensitivity, towards the aural quality and appropriateness of diction, towards the rapper's position  vis-a-vis  himself, friends, society (though Eminem gets to discuss media attention too).  Mark Kinner, who is The Streets, guides us with his conversational style, weaving in and out of the distinctly British rhythms.  That means: clubby, guess he listened to Massive Attack, beats with small cracks, pleasant.  And engaging, the tracks never obscuring the tone-poem, for good reason.  i'm not going to post any as i feel that any amount would be too little.  Good descriptions of getting wasted, also Eminemish.  *   *   * Now some personal stuff.  "Sexxy Underwear" (the extra "x" because they're extra-sexy) is a really sweet song, i feel.  Yes, it certainly is a Dr. Masseuse rocker, with grunts and emotion, but i wanted the love to be evident.  Hence starting in media res with  'Cause you know, i've got to go--i'm leaving California , speaking to someone who'll miss me dearly.   Heading out for the big show , i explain, acknowledging then that i've got  a brand new cell 'phone and new haircut , which means i'm looking good but i'm still connected and faithful--you know how musicians can live on the road.   'Cause you know i won't be gone for too long, girl, when i find my treasure true--it'll lead me right back to you  Yep, continuing out away from home, but aware of how important home--and she--is.  And also echoing the fist line.  Second verse, i'm  getting high, strung up like a kite , suffering under  this West Coast cross i bear .  Alright, pot, blah-blah.  But visualize it!  A kite, traditionally with that cross bracing it, connected by a thin string to the flyer, safe on the ground.  And some internal rhyming, "West Coast cross" sounds cool.  And then realization,  wherever i go, i take myself with me--here i am, here i am , Where am i?  Here i am, not entirely alone, mayhaps on-stage, shouting in one breath  "If you feel what i'm giving it's a reason to believe in giving power to the people RAISE YOUR FIST UP LIKE A STEEPLE!"   And why, why music, why steeples, why love?  Hell, why anything?   'Cause we're all looking for something to believe in .   'Cause you know i won't be gone for too long, girl, when i find my treasure there--you're sleeping in you sexxy underwear  Well, putting it a little more rootedly, to pun away.  i never said that i didn't enjoy a little cuddling now and then.  And then Robin explains--and rightly-- i need something write about, i need the words i can sing, i see those words wrapped around your hips and cover up your lips --to woman's underpants, may not be the best thing on earth, but close to it.  And then a bunch of rockin' and chorus repetition.  Go Bears.

      Through my somewhat extensive readings of the--mostly Western--canon, only one writer has altered my frame.  Friedrich Nietzsche had the incisive reasoning, granted only a few, to not only recognize the frame of culture [and split infinitives], but to pin it down and--so doing, as in sub-atomic physics--change it.  In this regard he joins the cadre of folk like Aristotle (scientific method), Martin Luther (institutionalized individualism--a nifty oxymoron), and Freud (hidden processes of thought determined by experience).  In fact, i tried to approximate Nietzsche's course of study after reading him early in college.  i had been studying Latin, a rather native speaker of German, then studied Old English, Middlehigh German... i aimed for philology.  The term itself, qualifies "love" (Gr.  philos ) with  logos , an expansive word and trove of denotations, the most important being "word" and "argument" and, in that striking Gospel of John, "Christ" ("In the beginning was the  logos  and the  logos  was with God."  John 1:1).    In a break from the more mundane, though nonetheless brilliant, German philologists who mapped the history of language in the 19th c., Nietzsche applied the socio-philosophical connotation of  logos  to his study of language, most importantly and remarkably in  Towards a Geneology of Morals .  The first of three sections of that work describes the evolution of the competing moralities of "good v. bad" and "good v. evil", tracking these simple adjectives common throughout Indo-European languages.  In short, the culture of positive, or "Master" morality, start from the premise that they are good, concluding that the Others are therefore bad--common or  vulgar , as the Romans said.  Competing, the Man of  Ressentiment  decided that the Others who were above him and circumscribed his life were "evil", necessarily making him good.  This is the much-maligned "Slave morality", to Nietzsche the foundation of Judeo-Christian thought.  His argument is persuasive and his scholarship--simply impeccable.  Exposed to this text, and with the help of Judith Butler's excellent professing, i have tried to internalize that lesson.  It probably helps that i am a male of northern and western European descent.  So, not to engage in Christian-bashing but to post my favorite aphorism, here is this gem (translated by Walter Kauffman, whose understanding of Nietzsche's great style makes him by far the best English interpreter).    " The philology of Christianity   How little Christianity   educates the sense of honesty and justice can be seen pretty well   from the writings of its scholars: they advance their conjectures as   blandly as dogmas and are hardly ever honestly perplexed by the   exegesis of a Biblical verse.  Again and again they say, "I am right,   for it is written," and the interpretation that follows is of such   impudent arbitrariness that a philologist is stopped in his tracks,   torn between anger and laughter, and keeps asking himself: Is it   possible?  Is this honest?  Is it even decent?          What dishonesties of this sort are still perpetrated from   Protestant pulpits today, how crudely the preachers exploit the   advantage that nobody can interrupt them, how the Bible is pricked   and pulled and the art of reading badly formally inculcated upon the   people -- all this will be underestimated only by those who go to   church either never or always.          In the end, however, what are we to expect of the   aftereffects of a religion that enacted during the centuries of its   foundation that unheard-of philological farce about the Old   Testament?  I refer to the attempt to pull away the Old Testament   from under the feet of the Jews -- with the claim that it contains   nothing but Christian doctrines and belongs to the Christians as the   true Israel, while the Jews had merely usurped it.  And now the   Christians yielded to a rate of interpretation and interpolation,   which could not possibly have been accompanied by a good conscience.   However much the Jewish scholars protested, everywhere in the Old   Testament there were supposed to be references to Christ and only to   Christ, and particularly to his cross.  Wherever any piece of wood, a   switch, a ladder, a twig, a tree, a willow, or a staff is mentioned,   this was supposed to indicate a prophecy of the wood of the cross... .   Has anybody who claimed this ever believed it?"  NB: The Nietzschean Scholarship Rule of Thumb (NSRoT): Whenever making an argument on the interpretation of Nietzsche, find at least three (3) passages which counter your argument.

      i think it's just great.&nbsp; Really, all this gay marriage--garriage--division.&nbsp; Sputtering Santorum (R - Pennsylvania) going on about national and marriage security, and he the most sculpted-yet-innocent cakeboy of the group.&nbsp; Riiiii-diculous.  But what's is so great is that the frame of the debate has shifted away from less enlightened moorings.&nbsp; It is no longer a debate about whether fags can buttfuck, thank goodness, thank SCOTUS, but whether they can marry!&nbsp; I mean: Garry!&nbsp; That was a quantum leap, from, say three years ago.&nbsp; i cannot say whether there will be steps taken back, as could well be the case, but coming so far so quickly is, how would one say, engruntling?  *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *  Here's a link to an epicurious recipe for trout.&nbsp; Read that if you like trout, read the comments in any case, "... golfer's outfit... brightly colored snake...":   http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=10049&kw=&amp;action=filtersearch&QueryZip=%28%28trout%29+%3CIN%3E+%28CNContent%2Ctitle%29%29&amp;Filter=recipe%2Dfilter%2Ehts&ResultTemplate=recipe%2Dresults%2Ehts&amp;QueryText=%28%28trout%29+%3CIN%3E+%28CNContent%2Ctitle%29%29&Collection=Recipes&amp;ResultStart=31&ResultCount=15&amp;BrowseLink=%3CA+HREF%3D%22%22%3EQuick+Search%3C%2FA%3E+%26gt%3B+keyword%3A+trout   Helluva link.  *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *  i sent an email to my sister Sara today.&nbsp; She lives in Munich.&nbsp; You can  urlLink translate  the German.&nbsp; i was having fun.&nbsp; The sZ is the  urlLink sueddeutsche Zeitung , the big newspaper from Munich.   So i decided to kick it up a notch today, adding another stop to my news' site* circuit. &nbsp;This is in the sZ's write-up on the discovery of former engineer--present and perpetual victim--Paul Johnson's head:    &nbsp;  "Nun habe Johnson etwas von dem zu Spüren bekommen, was Muslime seitlangem von Raketen aus Apache-Kampfhubschraubern erlitten hätten. Der49 Jahre alte Amerikaner hatte am Ziel- und Nachtsichtsystem der Kampfhubschrauber gearbeitet." (   http://www.sueddeutsche.de/ausland/artikel/726/35691/    )    &nbsp;  Maybe i'm just too accustomed to anglo-journalism, but this has the ring of rhetoric, no? &nbsp;What about those subjunctives "habe" and "hätten"? &nbsp;Almost, um, Arabesque? &nbsp;However, i had also never before come across the word "enthauptet". &nbsp;The elegant efficiency of thatGerman construction makes "decapitated" sound like a bag of shit. Somewhat.    &nbsp;  To change the subject--severely--, here's a picture of my Sarah. &nbsp;You can remember which is whom were... what? &nbsp;i mean: you can remember which one you are by saying, "'h' is for Hebrew." &nbsp;She and i get along alright... LIKE A FOX!    &nbsp;  Ahhh, thanks for letting me tickle the ivories for a while. &nbsp;Strokin' the keys, that is. &nbsp;i hope you're having a wonderful evening.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hellos to everyone.    &nbsp;  take'r easy-anthony    &nbsp;  * i've felt for a while that in terms such as "news site", the "news" is not an attributive adjective. &nbsp;Rather, it functions as a nominal genitive, following the constructions "reading the news" and "watching the news", where "the news" is the direct object. &nbsp;That's why i added an apostrophe. &nbsp;And then an asterisk. &nbsp;Which is why you're reading this.
