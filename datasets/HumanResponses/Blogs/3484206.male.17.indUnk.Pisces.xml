      Well, this is the last year of high school, only 1 week left. But before I get to leave, the school gets to screw me and my classmates over by giving a shit load of homework due in the last 2 weeks. Students should not be forced to stay up till 3 in the morning completing the 2 projects due the next day and then having to study for 1 of the 3 tests. On top of that, I can no longer enjoy my weekend because of an english project and chemistry lab report. The last weeks of school are meant to be slack, not crammed so full of homework that if you cram anymore, the whole universe would collapse on itself. A logical solution would have been to give us these assignments during the curse of the fourth term, but no, were stuck doing them at the end scrambling our asses of. O well, I guess we just have to take the shit that is thrown at us...

      First, I would like to state that I am a huge wrestling fan. Yes, I admit that wrestling is fake, but for Christ's sake, I dont think someone could survive having a chair closed on there throat or being hit with a 2 by 4 wrapped with barbed wire. Wrestling is justifiably fake because too many people would die if it wasn't. Now comming to people, people do not have a reason to be fake, they just are. People should be themselves and not care what other people think of them. I used to care about what people thought of me, then I met a great man (sorry not you joel) who taught me an important lesson, Who really cares what people think of you? So what if people think bad of you? What would you do to change their opinion? Will this matter in the near or far future? Most people will try to be something that they are not to try and fit in which I find is retarded, you are who you are. If you are reading this and you no longer want to care, learn how to be indifferent. Believe me, it is a lot easier and funner to be indfferent and not care about anything. Here is an example, what would you do if a group of people was insulting your favorite sports team. If you answered pretend like you do not like them then you should be shot. What I would do is call everyone bad mouthing the Canadiens a bunch of dumb imbred bastards who could not tell their asses from their elbows. Yes this may sound a bit absurd... but who cares? Certainly not you because you are indifferent to everything around you which includes the opinions of others. I want to conclude this post by saying don't be fake or you will regret it, just be yourself and have a good time and life will be pleasent.

      The first thing I would like to say is WHOOOOOOO GO HABS GO! MONTREAL FOREVER. Now that that is out, let's get down to bussness. First round we beat Boston's ass. My one good memory of this series was at game 4, when Montreal was up 3-1 and then Boston tied it. NO that is not the good memory, the good memory comes in game 7, anyhow, after Boston tied it up, the game was going into overtime. I met up with a Boston fan who was being booed by so many people and his response was at least my team didn't blow a 3-1 lead. Well it just turns out that after that game, the series was 3-1 for Boston AND WE CAME BACK AND BEAT THEIR SORRY ASSES!!! And for that guy who made that remark about 3-1, I hope you find ur way to my blog so I can laugh at you very hard. Anyways, going into rouns 2, we face the Tampa Bay lightning, who won the Stanly Cup today. It just so happens that our goaltender recieved death threats which have not been traced back to anyone yet. Suspicious? I think so. If you are going to beat a team especially in the palyoffs, have a little class, if not for you then for the fans. I am not saying that the deathreats were from a person from Tampa Bay, but it does seem a little convinient. The second reason that we lost is that our team was so damn injured. This is not Tampa Bay's fault but still a reason to whine. The final reason we did not win is that Tampa Bay won, they played great set of games and I tilt my hat to them. So in conclusion GO HABS GO!!!

      Contradictory to what everyone says, the word "Paki" is not a racist insult, at least when I say it. I tend to use the word paki as one would tend to use the word bitch. No, when someone calls someonelse a bitch, I am pretty sure they are not reffering to someone as a female dog, same thing for when I use the word paki, I am not using it as a racist insult, just as a regular insult. Do not get me wrong, I do not have anything against the Pakistanians, but I just started to use the word a lot for fun and sooner or later, whoops there you go a lawsuit. Ok, well maybe that didnt happen, but it might one day. My point is that some words have bad meanings but we use them anyways, not to hurt people but only to rob their dignity. I am not racist, but I like using the word Paki.

      This post is just a tribute to the greatest television show on earth, Most Extreme Elimination Challenge. For those of you who do not know what MXC is a imported dubbed extreme japenese gameshow that can make you laugh until you vomit, that is unless you have no sense of humour (shame on you) and then you will find it not funny (you should be shot repeatedly). Where has society gone wrong? Why is it not right to laugh at these people? I bet even the cavemen laughed at each other when one was running through a pond of boulders and fell head first into one. Anyhow, MXC is the only thing that keeps me going (besides food sleep and oxygen of course), too bad it only plays on spike tv, and on top of that it is being played less. I say that it should be illegal to not whatch this and that every television network should be forced to play it at least 23 hours a day, the rest would be for commercials. Well im going to watch my tape collection of MXC right now, and by the way before I forget, EAT SHITAKE!!!
