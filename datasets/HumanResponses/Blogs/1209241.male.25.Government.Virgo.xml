      Do people think that I don't notice I have a sunburn? Do they think that by asking me "Hey, are you burnt?" it will hurt less. Do they honestly believe they are contributing any valuable worth to society by bringing up this topic just for my benefit. I'm Canadian, and that means that I talk about the weather by default when conversation stalls but good GOD I hate when people ask me stupid questions about getting sunburnt.  Being "Canada White" skinned, my summer pigmentation pretty much goes like this: -White, Red, light pink, white, red, light pink, white, red, dark pink, dark pink, red, not-quite-white, red, dark pink, tanned followed by the end of September and back to white for another 8 months.    All told, the car wash to raise money for Heart & Stroke pulled in over $400 and was a great day outside. This photo was of the one (1) car that came in off the street - a 350Z in deep maroon. It had all the guys admiring the car and being VERY careful about washing it and all the women checking the owner's hand for wedding bands ;)   Water fights - a childhood pleasure that can stand the test of time!

       "Do you know Joe from Canada?"  "Oh sure I do, of course, he just had another baby..." Ummm NO! It doesn't quite work that way folks. So when Andrew asked me if I knew Emily who aparently talks to him about the some of the same haunches that I frequent I goffed at him.  But then I started digging around  urlLink his blog  a little and found a link to  urlLink her blog . Saw a picture, poked around a bit but still no recognition. Check the comments and I see one from a girl named Jen. Big deal right?  WRONG!   That particular Jen happens to be a new, decently good friend of mine with  urlLink her own blog . So while I may not know Emily, I have two different two-degree separational opportunities to know her. Sing with me now children:  It's a small world after all! It's a small world after all!

      After the booze and free net score I went to Coyote Rock with a few friends to climb. Hands are a little on the sore side, but was pretty good.

      I went and saw Shrek 2 last night. It is truly amazing how far animation has come since Mickey was whistling showboat tunes back in the 1930's. Other than a slight offset of lip to vocal movement and the freeformity that real actors have in moving around the screen, the visual quality of this movie is on par with reality. I think because everything was lush and oppulent in the kingdom of "far, far, away" it was actually a preferable place to exist.  I won't spoil any details because I thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of the movie going in not knowing the story other than big green ogres and 'Donkey' and friends were in for some more hilarious hijinks. This one went well beyond the first in bringing nearly every storytale / fable I could imagine into the mix. Pinoccio, 3 blind mice, gingerbread men, Puss 'n Boots, Fairy God mothers and tons more! Dreamworks did well and will do well financially!   Of the Moments...   Choice Quote:  "You are very sensual!"

      The plans for mOOpleman are slowly gathering steam and I'm more than reasonably excited. But akin to the Burn itself, when after that first year it's never quite as intense, I'm feeling a little bit of dissatisfaction about it happening too. My first TO regional burn was stupendious, and I left the grassy playa with huge feelings of optimism and excitement for the summer ahead. This time round, I have several reasons already to be very optimistic about the summer, and it doesn't sound like all the wonderful f*ckos are going to be able to make it.  I know it will be awesome and I will have a crazy good time, and I'll come back raving about how I could have been so stupid as to have ever thought it wouldn't be one of the best times of my life in recent memory. The fireworks I bought are cool and will be definate crowning touch to the Man!   Of the Moments...

      Free cudos to whoever can answer this useless trivia question. There's a movie which I don't think starred the child co-star to that 80's TV show which had Alan Thicke, Kirk Cameron, brother of Candice Cameron who was on Full House with Dave Coulier who supposedly had a song written about him by Alanis Morisette. So yeah, in this movie with the character maybe played by Kirk, he's a hockey coach of a junior hockey team and the child star wants to play even though he's hurt and the coach won't let him play if he can't hold a stick at the middle and turn his wrist all the way in each direction.  The only reason I want to know is because right now my right wrist is sore from the softball on the weekend that I can't do that.

      Warning, if you're thirsty, need to go to the bathroom, hungry or short on time or some combination of all of the above, rectify these situations as needed before reading this blog post because it's likely to be a long one.  After the water-cooled joy of Friday's car wash I was feeling full effects of sunburn. But when we met up with all the people playing on our team in the 3-pitch tournament Saturday morning, I wasn't worried about the sunburn - I was worried about what might happen on the road, to be a story that forever stays on the road, that might come back to haunt me later in life. No video cameras were present, and nobody captured my finer moments on film, so I think we're safe for now, but there were some good PG-13 stories that can be documented here for all time.   I showed that fence who's boss!  When one is playing outfield, they should be mindful of their environment. Specifically, how close one is to the fence and the velocity with which one approaches said fence. Early on in the second game, possibly with less-than-minor amounts of mexican water in my system and Jager-liqui-courage, I chased a deep fly ball towards the center field fence. While I didn't approach with terminal velocity I had the next best thing - enough to bounce of the metal links with my face and knee and barrell roll backwards. After I chased the ball back towards the infield and threw in to the cut-off man, L asked if I was ok.      "Why?"      "Well, you just ran into the fence."      "Oh, so I did. I should go get my glove back from it!"  Got a bitchin little scar below my left eye (the multi-broken nose defense system protected my expensive laser-eyes from being hurt) and a knee that doesn't feel happy you could say. MomC was concerned for me, but the liqui-courage had me feeling no pain and kept playing the rest of the game.   The affect of alcohol on the physics of ball-flight  About two years ago I played one season of 3-pitch with the CP league. Somewhere during the middle of the season my arm decided to forget how to throw a ball. Oh sure, I could get it to go forward, but whether it went to the desired target, impacted the ground or any other foreign object on it's way there was anybody's guess. Warming up with L & N earlier I knew it hadn't gotten any better. So after the first game loss we went back to MOTEL BEN (yes, the motel was named Ben!) and just got shit-faced. When we came back to play the next game Jamie's higher-level brain functions were missing...We were back with natural talent, instinct and reactions. I could throw well again! And a lot of it carried over to the next day (oh wait, there was good mexican water in my system then too!) But it's good to know that I can throw again! Thank you Corona!   Hrmmm, it seems a lot of the rest of the story cannot be told for fear that it will incriminate me or those involved. But my digicam did snap one or two good pictures very few of which will see the light of day or digital display. There is one that's just too cute not to share with the world (despite what the subject may claim to be the case)    Of the Moments...

      I'm *SO* hungry right now it's not even funny. Being hungry rarily is funny, maybe in a 'I'm so hungry I'm starting to get dilusional and so everything else seems funny to me' but the hunger itself isn't laugh-out-loud funny that's for sure. Going to 'The Oak Room' for a meeting for lunch today. Can't decide what I want to eat.   Their nachos are great, but maybe not filling enough.   The beef taco salad is great, but doesn't usually treat my colon very well   The curry is good by bland taste and I'm not really in the mood for it today   A big beefy cheesy burger could be aiiiight   Dare I try something new?   The sky seems to be falling quite hard today at work. Atleast the true sky is blue and not raining down like it has for the last bajillion days. Fun!   Of the Moments...

      I think it'd be funny if my company had a talent contest at their next gathering (Christmas party, etc). I could walk up there with a 1L bottle of what looked like water and stand in front of a Christmas table with a couple big candles on it. Pretend to take a drink of water and do a spit take and breathe out a huge ball of fire cause it's actually lamp oil. Hehehe.  Lola's staff that her friend in Montreal made was AWESOME! It was a dark cherry wood with rubberized handle that screwed perfectly at the center like a pool cue. It was heavy enough that it gave the right feel for spins and looked MUCH better than the one I currently have which is Steph's old one. If I had something like that, I'd definately practice more (because you can match fuel on both sides of the kevlar) and it looks better. For that part of the talent I'd start out with El-Wire or Glowsticks on chain in the dark with just a candle so they wouldn't really know who is doing what until it starts spinning. Then (if the glow were small caribeaners on the ends of the chains) quick-release them and light up the kevlar. Hehehe.  What to wear tho :)  One happy thought of performance cross-over to end the work day!   Of the Moments...   Choice Quote:  Jamie's Grammar Service: We write things goodly!

      I can call it the 'Best mOOpleman Ever' easily because it was the very first mOOpleman. I can also call it the best regional Burn of the year because it appears the only one! But aside from semantics, it actually was a damned good weekend.  -Glenn and I (with some minor assistance from Scotty & Curtzel) built the man in less than 36 hours and still found time to party. Who needs Simon ;) It was a vastly different experience from previous regional burns where I only found time for partying. Just like working @ Camp Artica in the desert, that physical effort and structure actually gives a different level of appreciation. Ottawa represent!  -Challenge yourself and your spirit by existing in a weekend of perpetual rain!  -While safety was maintained at all times, by all rights some of the things which happened the night of the Burn should result in me being a late person who could have made some grave mistakes. Hindsight: If you're going to be the one responsible for putting the kerosene on the man, bring an extra pair of clothes to the Burn because you WILL get kerosene all over yourself despite your best intentions. Firebreathing with lamp oil is WAY better than with kerosene as there is no taste. Sunshine showed me I still have a long way to go on that aspect, but potential and desire definately there.  -Sketchyness & Drama - People who can't handle things shouldn't do them.

      On the way back from the Detroit BM Decomp last fall, we stopped in at an Arby's that had a line longer than my well, it was pretty long. We went inside and there were only about 3 people waiting but the only staff actually working was a newbie. The regular was copping an attitude and twirling her jerry-curl about the line-up on the drive-thru. The manager - about 5,000 pounds, had his walkie-talkie on an around the neck chain for access and managed the daunting task of standing up during the 20+ minutes we waited to get two sandwiches, curly fries and a couple of drinks. American slothfulnicity at it's finest!  This morning I stopped in at a Tim Horton's on a beautiful spring morning to get a Hot Chocolate and Fruit Explosion muffin. There were about 8 staff on hand, maybe 3 people inside the store in line to order and a line-up to the drive-thru of atleast 15 cars.   PEOPLE OF CANADA, I IMPLORE YOU!

      You hear major league basketball, baseball et al players talk about  'being in the zone ' and ' finding the groove ' and such where you just feel so comfortable with what you're doing that you have no fear that what you are doing is going to go through the bucket, hit the homerun, score the touchdown, etc. In a bit of an epiphony yesterday I realized how true it is. Some of my Ultimate teammates were talking about their inability to dive for a disc, or feeling pressured to throw the disc before they need to / have a good target or don't feel like they are doing much when they defend a player.  The mentality I get on the field is that if I can touch it, I'm going to catch it. I may not knock down the disc from the thrower every time, but I'm going to do it a lot and if I can't manage that I am going to make them change the throw they want to do. Some would call if cockyness, I'd say confidence. Confidence that I know I play the game well enough that I will make things happen.  A lot of my teammates have asked how I catch so many discs and why I dive so much? One question answers the other...I can get to more discs to catch because I dive for them, without thought on the matter I get my hands / upper body in a position to catch the disc more often than another person might. When a disc is thrown ahead of me (within reason) I don't stop running or slow down, I know the disc will slow and hover and give me an opportunity to catch it.  As an offensive player you never take your eyes off the disc. As a defender, you should never take your eyes off of me ;)

      Innovapost has a Monday night golf league that I'm going to play regularily in this summer to get my game back. I've been out twice this year and shot 94 and 89 at Greensmere which I'm more than happy with. Keeping a .xls on the go with the cards and stats. For those that are interested, thus far:      Average Scoring     Par 3's  3.75    Par 4's  5.40    Par 5's  5.63      Averge / Round     Eagles  0    Birdies  0.5    Pars  5    Bogies  6.5    Doubles  5     Other   1     If those doubles can be turned into bogies, more pars & better will come as the short game comes back to me. I used a co-workers drivers for the last 12 holes yesterday and I was hitting 265+ to good locations near / on the fairway. Me thinks that will HAVE to be the next acquisition, will have bigger impact on my game than a new set of irons (next year).   I also sneezed 7 times yesterday to set the record higher...

      I'm driving down Dalhousie on my way to the bonfire party when I see a 30 - 45 year old woman standing on the street corner. She's wearing a pair of jeans riding semi-low and what I thought initially to be a purple tight top. No, it's a swimsuit, and I can see the cutlines in before her hips before the V descends into the denim. And I think to myself, "Oh damn, why would somebody want to wear..." the thought trails off as a car with a man and a woman turns in front of me past the woman.  There is another woman in the passenger seat blissfully unaware of swimsuit woman. The man, driving, practically has his tongue hanging out as he makes the turn. He (quite talented I must give him credit) manages to keep his head cranked back looking at swimsuit woman while he completes his turn, doesn't catch the eye of his passenger (presumably wife or GF) and proceeds down the opposite direction of Dalhousie from me.  "Oh. That's why. Because all men have two heads :/" Some like them young & nubile, others like old & raunchy. I prefer cute, intelligent and with a little wild side - (preferably saved for the bedroom :)

I don't necessarily disagree with a lot of what she wrote (and she did write a heck of a lot) but the whole thing irks me as she paints a generalized negative view of the human male. I haven't managed to vocalize in exactly what ways it irks me, but that will hopefully come in due time.  Friday: -Go after work to have 'a few drinks' on a patio in Kanata -Leave said patio as the sun comes down, didn't see that one coming -Go for a few more down the street and stay responsible in the DD category. -Same not true for all :( -Go to Griffen's, don't enjoy the vibe there as is usually the case. -GREAT PITA!!! Pineapple - the world's best sandwich topping IMHO.  Saturday: -How to minimalize post-drinking-effects:      6AM > Wake up earlier than needed          > Glass of water, roll over and back to sleep          > Toss & turn in and out of consciousness for a couple hours          > Continue to drink more water      9AM > Wake up well in advance of when you need to          > LONG SHOWER! Maybe I'm getting water into system by osmosis?  -Go rock-climbing at Farm Rock in Gatinueas with 6 people. -The bugs absolutely ate me alive. My forearms had huge swelled welts and legs were splotched pink and red, my head had one welt that dripped blood...not sure from the mosquito or from me but damn they were viscious to me today! -Really day of climbing, tried a crack line that couldn't succeed on, but did get over the first difficult edge which was better than expected. If you don't fall - are you really pushing yourself? The 3 lines I did take up the rockface were all very enjoyable. -I think Calibogie is on tap for next weekend or so...  -Pack up indoor camping gear for bonfire west of Ottawa with *K*. -BBQ & Beer before leaving -Met some good people, drank a lot of decent beer, slept the sleep of champions  Sunday: -Lazy day :)  I must realize that my body is trying to tell me something (relatively constant indigestion, hunger not just being hungry but almost cramped pain but inability to eat large amounts of food, plumbing problems & smells). Maybe I'll go to the doctor about it someday :}  Starting to get a sense of this blogging thing. Just as I am not, it won't be a wild & controversial topic generating much back & forth discussion. It won't be a political summary place that people end up linking to with purdy graphs. It will probably be a summary of my existence with the oddball thoughts that rattle my brain from time to time and a few web links that catch my fancy. Everyone can create their own piece of the Interweb as they see fit, and right now this is how I chose to do mine.   Of the Moments...   Choice Quote: Malcovitch, Malcovitch, Malcovitch?

      Tap, tap, tap, all day long Gonna sit and think this song Lyrics so bad they'll make you squeal I just had a pretty-ok BBQ meal What's the deal with rhyming in time Because today I didn't drink Coke with lime  Verging on that precarious cliff between utter boredom and extremely efficient today at work. I've had brain fart ideas come from all angles and have acted on a few of them too. The more late night 'what do you do? what do you want to do? why do you want to do it?' conversations I have, the more appealing the 'pick-up-life, relocate-to-sunny-climate, start-something-new' approach sounds appealing.  While everything that is new is not necessarily different, it definately feels different because it's new and it all challenges you to find the little joys in things you never knew. Ottawa / Canada is great b/c it's got a sense of comfort that's bourne out of years of existing here. Jobs, friends, housing have all changed but like my personality the city has the same feel as it did when I got here 7+ years ago.  So...Hawaii, Australia, Grand Cayman Islands, Arizona? If I do go, where should I go? Gotta be some place with good golf courses :) I know I'll find sports and social circles wherever that is, but outside of throwing a dart onto a world map I'm not sure what makes one chose a place over an other. I didn't chose Carleton because of any particular reason, it just felt the most right I guess compared to the other Uni-options waaaay back when.

      Looking for a chique, romancical (today only, this is a word!) place to stay in la belle cite du Montreal? Check the link in the title of this post for 'A La Carte' Bed & Breakfast. *K* was flying back to town via Dorval and I offered to pick her up (free bonus points eh!) and we spend the night in Montreal.  The Bed & Breakfast had that healthy mixture of old house charm with new fixtures and one REALLY comfy bed. The owner person offered some good suggestions on dining choices, and had all the things you would need / expect from a residence. That's why B&B's are great, the mixture of the feeling you are staying at home - but on the road - with the knowledge you are on the road and don't have to lift a finger to clean / etc if you don't really want to.   We stayed in the  Mother Nature Room  which had a wonderful jacuzzi tub. Add one bottle of wine, some candles, music, two people and it was a great get-away from the everyday.  Too bad I had to come back to work today :( The traffic coming out of Montreal was a little hectic, didn't get to the office until 11AM. And truth be told, if I didn't have major deliverables for the end of this month, I wanted to just stay on 'vacation'! Le sigh...   Of the Moments...   Choice Quote:  "Thank you for picking me up."

      It's amazing how tiring sitting in the sun and drinking can truly be. Went to the Ottawa beer festival during the afternoon/evening on Saturday and drank pretty steadily for the 6 hours or so we were there. By the time we got back home everyone was into happy drunk sleepy mode. Layer on some decent Lauzon's steaks and it was nap time.  If you are in need of a feel-good/big-adventure movie, rent Big Fish. It's a Tim Burton movie which tells you everything and nothing about the movie, but it's a life adventure of a man who tells tall tales and his son trying to understand just what kind of a man his father truly is. Bright, shiny, colourful!  The strange episode of Saturday night was that as I was getting ready to go over to A's place to watch the movie, I went to the car to get some stuff and there was a homeless woman sitting on the front stoop of our next door neighbour - smoking, spitting and drinking a Timmie's coffee. On the way back I reasonably politely mentioned "You probably DON'T want to be sitting there!" and by the time I came back out of the house she had left.  When I left A's place around 2AM walking home there was an emergency services (or something equally named) van across from the arena where there's a small park. One of the staff was sitting on the ground holding the same homeless person in her lap trying to console her. Saying things along the lines of "Don't worry, it's just the drugs" and "This is why you can't take  ". The whole episode reminds me how lucky I am. I have the family/friend/social circles to have the potential to do well in life, and it's obviously had an effect on who or what I am / have become. But by the same token, I've earned my way here by working for everything that I have. Yes I feel for those who haven't been afforded the same opportunities I have, but I shouldn't be forced to have them in my space and world.  To an extent I'm glad Canada has the policy towards helping the homeless that it does, as it probably ensures homelessness is not nearly as much a problem as major cities in the USA are subject to. However, I don't feel I have to show compassion in all cases. With an election coming up, homelessness usually becomes an issue - although I haven't heard $0.02 about it from any of the candidates as yet.

      It's 3:34PM and I am 'definately' ready to get this weekend started. Things are falling into place rather well for the rest of the summer @ work, where I've got myself working with a bunch of good people with some pretty interesting technologies. I figure next week I'll make time at night to start 'Learn flash in X days' websites and such as by the middle of July I may have the opportunity to work that skillset within the workplace.  *K* has been sick or travelling all this week which sucks donkey parts, but sooner our later our life patterns will fall back in synch and it will be right as rain. This weekend I'm heading out into the boonies of Quebec again for a 1-pitch softball tournament. Ummm yeah!  What happened to taking it easy?  P.S. The title is from Swingers!   Of the Moments...

      First, it was the ankle. My own stupidity for not resting what I knew was the worst sprain I'd ever experienced. All for the 'glory' of not losing to a half-way competitive team that had several players from my soccer team on it.  Next, the knee and wrist. Pretty sure these happened on the same incident when I ran face first full tilt into a metal fence chasing a softball while ineubriated in center field. I got a lasting wonderful trace scar below my eye and a right wrist and left knee that don't respond well to pressure or force anymore.  Now, it's the hip. Playing ultimate last night I did an unnormal dive. Normally when I dive and am not landing back to my feet it is 'with speed' so that it's a horizontal leap more than a vertical and I slide across the ground when I do. In this case I turned quick, made a few steps and them jumped...Caught the disc...and fell like a sack of potatoes. Felt no pain during the game (of course) but this morning saw a very small bruise on the hip. I expect this will grow in the coming days and hopefully just be a hip pointer that heals full well unlike the rest.  Damnit, I'm getting old and broken :( I'm sure a lot of it has to do with how I treat my body, but by the same token why can't I heal faster or permanently anymore. It really sucks. At this rate my body will have to be more than 60% artificial by the time I'm 35. As long as the rod and tackle are 100% all natural and function properly right??? :P

      Wow! Wow Wow Wow Wow WOW! And one more WOW just for effect!  If Wednesday and Thursday were a regular weekend, or I didn't book Friday off work, I would have been hurting severely on the 'Monday morning' going back. Tiger, KhatBleu, Little D and Paul came down from the T. and we had one HELL of a great Canada Day. There's a lot of it I don't want to tell, or can't formulate into words to be able to tell yet, but there's a lot of fun that can be told:  I found a new place to live!  Starting Aug 1st I'll be living above Rideau just off King Edward in a great one-bedroom apartment. It's got a HUGE shared balcony with 2 other one-bedroom apartments (with from what the landlord tells me two very nice women living in the other two). The building and street are very nice. The living room isn't LARGE, but I'll be able to have my computer desk, a (to be bought) love-seat and television setup in there plus some shelving. I expect I'll get rid of the white MDF wall-unit as it's just too big and not the right style towards what I want to have. The bedroom is pretty decent, maybe not as big as my current one, but when I take out the shelving in the bedroom it will have a better feel. Can't remember if the kitchen had a dishwasher or not, but definately a double-sink. The whole place feels like it has a lot of good light and being a 4-story building will be the right mix of people / quiet that I want.   Ultimate Victory  We won about 14 - 2. I really have to figure out what is wrong with my right wrist, left knee, right ankle because they are starting to affect how I play sports. Warming up I can throw a disc quite ok, but in the game I can't see to hit (#$*&. Atleast I can dive and catch the disc without any problems. We're now in 2nd place alone or maybe first depending on how things went with the other games.   Random Friendships  Peter & Dave stopped by Glenn's for a few drinks, brought some of their friends with them. Oddly enough J.C was one of them that knew Dave. Sing with me people:  It's a small world, after all!   It's a small world, after all!  Atleast Coincidence Girl didn't know them as well ;P   Fireworks  Walk towards the King Edward bridge downtown and before you get onto the bridge there is an intersect to Sussex (I believe) and a very nice area that overlooks the water. We found GREAT space to sit and watch the fireworks, not crowded and maybe closer to where they were going off than overtop of the parliament with all it's throngs of people. Will remember that spot for next time.   Dancing Machine  After pitstopping at *G*'s apt, we went out to Zaphod's to meet up with *A* and dance up a storm. Aparently I had a whack-o-energy because I hardly left the dance floor. Those times when I did I'd have a little snack (tee-hee) and be ready to go again. Little D and I went upstairs for a while to watch a little entertainment. The girls were not so much dancing as crawling on the dance floor like writhin' slutty animals. It got to that point of getting the effect but only teasing it, saving the rest for the green room if you so chose to go there. When we came back down to Zaphod's it had an obvious effect on the cowpeople on the dance floor.   Losing It!  The longer you go, the harder you push, and the more you try to block it out, the harder it hits you when the walls break down. When we left Zaphods walking home, the darkness took hold and I went into another world. I'm not sure what the rest of the world saw but I didn't care. Eventually I found my friends again and then came home to sleep.   Belaflecktoning  Friday night I was very tired, even after a good 2 hour nap, but I still went out to see the banjo-jazz-stylings of BelaFleck and the Flecktones. Their bass guitarist was amazing, and Mr. Futuristic (I think?) had something called a drumitar? Make some funky sounds. Will search that one out on the interweb for more details.   Domage  I'm going to build the 25' geodesic dome for BM this year. Not sure where/how the fabric will come together, but I'll own a dome. Woot! Glenn & Tiger are gonna help build so July / August should have good efforts put towards making that happen. Little D seems to be taking on fabric creation. Woot!  And for the second half of the weekend you ask? Camping in Calibogie with *K* and some Burner-friends. Maybe I'll actually get that MMMassage that has been about a year + in coming. It's been quite a while since *K* and I have had any real time together. This slow-building thing is very enjoyable but equally frustrating. Must post a re-print of the XPress sex column that I read the other night. Encapsulated with I learned from past relationships pretty well.  $0.02

      I was at a bar - not sure who with really - but having a few beers none the less. We were also there to buy our tickets to  urlLink Om Festival  but didn't know what line-up to be in. So I went up to this guy and asked him if he knew which line was for tickets. He said he didn't know, but was looking to buy tickets too. Apparently as I backed away from him, I bumped into his girlfriend and he got all offended.  I walked back to my buddy and was sitting beside another guy and a really hot girl was standing by the railing above us. The guy who was offended (We'll call him Joe ok) walks over to the girl and very intentionally bumps into her. She falls over the railing and - while she didn't die - was obviously very hurt. He looks at me with an 'oops' sort of face. I yell across the bar "What do I care, that's not my girlfriend"  So Joe is all pissed now. He walks down the stairs towards me, or rather towards the guy beside me (who I don't know) and gives him one massive, tongue-heavy kiss. He looks at me with a 'what-you-gonna-do-bout-that' look. I laugh my ass off and say, "Oh darn, you kissed some random guy sitting beside me at a bar. I guess you didn't know I wasn't gay dumbass!" and walk away laughing with my friend out of the bar.  And then I woke up!

      This one was weird...I was driving in my car with my old boss Penny and my friend Karin. We were driving to somewhere near Nevada which might make sense, but it wasn't for B.M. it was to go pitch some sort of development contract with the Department of Defense. We arrived all well and good, and went to their meet & great diner that evening. The only thing they were serving was strawberries with white or dark chocolate. The dream ended rather abruptly with all 3 of us running through the tunnels of this Area 51 style non-descript building to get back to my car (which had a rail gun attached side mount behind the drivers door). We got out ok and I woke up.

      Sunday night I wanted to be a 'quiet' night in after the weekend and I ended up coming home at 2AM after successfully quelching my desire for Strongbow (@ Highlander along with some very good scotch).  Last night was going okay but I kept finding myself ordering Jager and Tequilla, then we hit the Dom for MEGA-MASSIVE quarts of 50 and didn't get home until much later than expected.  Where is this desire to drink hard coming from? I'm playing enough sports and things that I'm already feeling weary tired on a regular basis for lack of sleep and yet I continue to push myself to do more. This summer has been great fun, but anything less than 'relaxing'. And then to top it off there's that little thing called Burning Man coming like a steam-engine freight train with no brakes on a track lubed with KY.  Jamie wants a break, but can't break the cycle.

      Great weekend. In reverse chronological order: -I saw a rainbow this evening. -I saw my girl this evening for dinner -Packed up a messy tent and got the heck out of dodge -Drank a lot! -Lost a baseball game we should have won...I played reasonably well, jacked one homer and hit a lot of hard line drives, caught any ball hit in my direction. Unfortunately our team on the whole didn't hit well and we lost by 1 to a team probably was not as good as us. -Drank a bit. -Lost to a team that should have beat us and did. -Woke up in a deflated air mattress - got accused of having a vibrator in my tent. -Drank exceptional amounts -Played a good game of 1-pitch softball, we won by 14 or something. -Left to play in a 1-pitch softball tournament with Co, D-Rock and the I-Post gang.  Will post a few pictures later this week, but it's Canada Day and that means lots of partying ;) Woot!  Oh yeah, the title is in reference to me wearing my cowboy hat all weekend and the Campbells' Bay locals calling me 'John Wayne' for the duration. Was great, I've never had the chance to do a John Wayne accent in public pardner, but my response was to say "That's John f*ckin' Wayne to you pardner". Gold Jerry, Gold! The announcer girl, even announced "Cowboy Jamie" up to bat after I had jacked my first homer.

      I was going to post that after beach volleyball last night on the drive home on the Canal between Hog's Back bridge and Bronson I saw 21 groundhog-type-creatures and that they were running rampant and letting ANYBODY into Carletoon U these days. But instead I have a better, real-life story:  It's 5AM, little Jamie is happily sleeping in his bed - actually having a great dream about a huge house party and him involved in a smut-puddle-threesome on a bed in the living room (except the weird part is one girl had a mouth that kissed like a boat propeller under suction or something) - when his door opens and a rather sizeable man bellows "You don't belong here!" Me: "Wha?" Him: "You don't belong here!" Me: "Who are you?" Him: "You have to go, you don't belong here!" Me: "Man, I live here, I don't know who you are but YOU have to go" Him: "I don't know what you think, but you have to leave."  Jamie's brain shakes the cobwebs out, turns on the light and sees a drunken unsteadily balanced vagrant standing in his doorway. First reaction - yell for roommate (drunken from the night before, still asleep, not much help). Second reaction - herd this piece of human chattle down the stairs in my residence he walked up to the front door...which I now see had been kicked in, dead-bolt lock still intact and part of the door frame lying on the floor. It's go time now Mendelbaum!  Me: Get out of my house (and yell louder for other roommate to assist in situation) Him: Don't push me I'm drunk Me: I know you are, and you're in my house, now GET OUT! Him: Don't push me, you're the one who's not supposed to be here.  He quickly, instead of leaving by the front door, walks down the hallway thru the kitchen and out the backdoor. Oooooh, I see, this is his personal playground is it. *grumble*. Turns out he just wanted to retrieve his vodka coolers that he had stole from the other place he broke into just around the corner from us which he was previously content to sit and drink on our back patio furniture.  By the time we called the cops - who thanks to living in the downtown core of Ottawa were very prompt to respond with 2 or 3 cruisers from the area - he had vacated and I wasn't going to be having any kind of regular sleep for the next couple of hours.  So yeah, how was your morning everybody?  Ottawa peeps take note - Unrelated to this series of events, I'm moving out on/around Aug 1st from my current place to above Rideau St just off King Edward into Sandy Hill. 1-bedroom apartment with a huge patio on the top-floor of a 3-story home renoe'd to 8 apartments. Will give particulars to those interested when I'm moved in, but a decent house warming-party is in order I believe.

      If anybody has any contacts in the plumbing/electrical/building supply industries, please get in touch with me. For Burning Man this year, we are looking to build a 25' diameter (14' high) 5 frequency geodesic dome that looks like a giant cat head sitting on the playa. We need to buy 125 10' lengths of EMT in 3/4" diameter. Home Depot / Rona is selling it for $8 per tube which is slightly (ha!) beyond the budget we'd like to work with...If anybody knows where I could get that on the cheap that would be wonderful!  Aparently: "China's demand for steel has caused skyrocketing steel prices in the United States. A single, ten foot long piece of 3/4 inch steel EMT electrical conduit has tripled in price to nearly seven dollars. A ten-stick bundle is almost $70. It was just in the $20 range a few months ago."

      A bunch of engineers are sitting around at a party, discussing the nature of the God, and who designed women.   The mechanical engineer states that God must also be a mechanical engineer because "if you look at all the pulleys and levers that drive the body, how the tendons and muscles and bones all work together, well, it's just amazing."  The chemical engineer says that no, God has to be a chemical engineer because "if you look at all the chemical processes that drive the body, how the hormones and the brain and the glands and everything else all interact, well, it's just astounding."  The electrical engineer says that no, God has to be an electrical engineer because "if you look at the circuitry of the body, how the thousands upon millions of nerve cells transmit signals from one part to another, well, it boggles the mind."   The civil engineer speaks up last of all and says, no, God is definitely a civil engineer, because "only a civil engineer would run a sewer through a playground. "  And why do I feel so compelled to write this joke? Because as god as my witness I won't (for the rest of 2004) drink Tim Horton's hot chocolate again.

      I just finished re-reading The HitchHiker's Guide to the Galaxy...A pre-requisite since it's been a year (and the first time it was as an audio CD whilst travelling down the 401 so didn't get the full appreciation of it). I now continue on to reat The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, Life, The Universe and Everything and So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish (the 4 parts of a trilogy). Woot!  I do believe a self-made shirt that says "Hyperintelligent Pan-Dimensional Being" on the front and "Would you care for a game of Brockian Ultra-Cricket?" could go over quite well on the playa. Not sure what I would use as an Ultra-Cricket bat..Maybe two very fuzzy foam covered stickets so that it's a good, soft, potentially long game?  Also going to buy another Ultimate battery-powered disc and figure out some pylons that glow because from camping in Calabogie I KNOW those will go over very well in the desert. Hehehe, schedule midnight games on the open playa...Wouldn't that be high-larious. Okay - it's the guy in the blue elwire suit, with pink glo-stick girl and the man with the furry bright hat against me, that guy with rainbow sparklers and Mr. Glow-poi. Okay? Go!   Of the Moments...   Choice Quote: Say chap, fancy a game of Brockian Ultra-Cricket?  Music: Trance'ish stuff off the web  Mood: Irritable  Food: Peach Iced Tea

      Let's see what topics in my current state of mental well-being I can pick off from the list of 'promised' updates. Whether for whomever is out-there to read or for myself to alliterate is irrelevant - I blog because I blog. &nbsp;  The good &amp; bad about new &amp; failed relationships  I met a girl at a bar roughly 2.5 months ago and "she picked me up". After a few hit &amp; miss telephone tag conversations we got in touch and the un-alcoholized conversations were as good as my memories of the alcoholized versions were. Although schedules massively conflicted, we dated for the better part of 2 months. Then there was a phone call. &nbsp; Maybe I got too comfortable too quickly? Maybe I wanted to see more there than was in reality? Who knows. I enjoyed the time and the short answer to "what did Jamie learn about himself as a result" is that in this particular case he didn't share enough of himself (compared to past situations where he shared too much and got hurt too deeply) to maintain the level of interest between all parties involved. &nbsp; I can't decide if that's the good part or the bad part about it all. The bad part is that *sigh* again, it wasn't my decision as to whether things continued or not...Maybe it just takes me a little longer to decipher the unspoken clues? &nbsp;  What to do for the desert this year?  -Buy a pair of wild cat eye contact lenses to go with the.... -Buying &amp; building of a 25' (14' high) geodesic dome that will look like a cat head when decorated -Work at ice camp -MORE COSTUMES - with 45 days left there's still lots of time but it feels like so little. -Travel @ night / @ day with more variety of people...It's not all about individualism.  -Visit Montreal :)    &nbsp;  That's all for now boys and girls!  &nbsp;

      Tonight was one of the more interesting ones. As I started to converse with friends and friends of friends, I began to realize that I was the exception rather than the rule. My sexual preference of 'straight' was not in the majority. And yet, strangely, it was a happy-go-lucky experience to converse and share the moments where that was the case. Everyone (save maybe myself) was comfortable when we left Paddy Bowlen's (and a particularily bad band butchering classic songs) and went to 'The Lookout'.  &nbsp;  I had never gone there previously, but my impressions from the outside were always that it was a relatively happening place. Lots of people on the balcony and relatively un-Top40 music blasting out from the insides. While I left there feeling generally satisfied, in part because of the one lesbian girl of our group with whom I gathered a good repore and inquissitiveness as to whether L might be better described as B, the actual internals of the bar were quite surprising. Dark painted walls, minimal decoration, and a DJ (unfortunately) that couldn't suspend disbelief that I was at a "gay bar".  &nbsp;  I've never claimed to be anything more than tolerant to people of other sexual preferences, and yet I have always enjoyed the few experiences I have shared with such persons. Following a rather strange e-mail earlier today about that particular topic as it relates to threesomes (the default male stereotype that 2F + 1M = ideal and 1F + 2M = wrong) tonight was an interesting continuation of internalized thought processes. In the end, I can say that I enjoyed the times that I had, and definately want to converse with the friends of friends I met tonight more. &nbsp;&nbsp;  The saying goes....'Not that there's anything wrong with that'  but it might be more appropriate to say ' Not that there's anything wrong with that, but if you haven't experienced the situation then you don't have grounds to speak'   &nbsp;  Excuse me while I kiss the sky!

      Dear people of earth, If you could kindly stop all the noise that has been happening this morning I would greatly appreciate it. There is a very severe throbbing going on in my head currently - possibly due to an overconsumption of alcohol within the last 24 hours - but results are inconclusive. I followed standard hang-over minimization procedures (greasy breakfast food before going to bed (Mello's), small greasy breakfast in the morning (work cafe), sit on the toilet reading for atleast 1/2 hour, drink lots of water) but this pounding still persists. I am now of the belief that people are MAKING TOO DAMNED MUCH NOISE for it to receed.  So if you could kindly  BE QUIET!   Thank you.   Of the Moments...   Choice Quote:  "Girls rock your boys"  Music:  That song...Come on feel the noise?  Mood:  Happy Go Lucky with a dash of whimsy  Food:  Pizza for lunch....again.

      17&nbsp;H&nbsp;17&nbsp;-&nbsp;It doesn't matter if it's a climb, a time trial or a sprint, Lance is unstoppable this year. He has just taken the lead away from Kloden in the closing 25 meter of the 204.5km 17th stage.We await confirmation of the minor places but it seems that Ullrich was third, Basso fourth and Landis fifth.

      I've always had a strange affinity to watching the tour, but never really had opportunity because of working and time zone differences, etc. The Outdoor Life Network has finally done coverage of the event properly. Their website (linked in title) has radio broadcast live of the event, up-to-the-minute statistical reports on the page and 4 or 5 commentator reports after each stage event. While it's not the same as watching it on tv - which they are also showing all live coverage each day - it is almost better because you have to imagine the riders charging up the mountain.   From Greg Lemonde to Miguel Indurain now to Lance - it's one of the few sports left which still have 'dynasties' as it were. The Yankees buy their way to competitiveness, the Lakers had the makings of one again but there was too much drama. While there is drama and controversy surrounding Lance, the first question people ask is still "Can he win?" not "How did he win?". Maybe because it's in Europe and the North American culture hasn't sucked all the life out of it yet, the same as World Cup Soccer still has an air of authenticity about it...Minus the dives.

      Mike may be one of the most insane people I know - I'll leave the question of certifiability to the proper authoratai - but he's also shown me&nbsp;some of the BEST ideas anybody in the history of this universe. And so I present for your viewing pleasure - Kelvinball in Calabogie :P Click the link in the title to download the 33 meg .zip file file of the .avi of a video of Mike &amp; I playing Kelvinball. The background commentary is from the 'grumpy old men' who were playing their own game of Bucket o' Beer.

      Went on the Ottawa Sport & Social Club boat cruise last night with Becky. Other than beers being over priced @ $5 for the plastic cup worth you got, it was quite a good time. By the time we got off the boat the binge caught up with me and I went straight to la-la-land and home to sleep.  Have decided I must buy that Loblaw's BBQ because it's got a HUGE grillspace and looks awesome. Andrew - no domestication comments required, it's all about the fire this time ;)   Of the Moments...

       You have new dimensions and rooms to play with. During my lunch hour today I made a photoshop 'to-scale' model of the new apartment, and model-sized versions of my furniture. So I can see what the room layout might look like with the bed here, the table there, etc before I get there and then I know where I want stuff to go.  As people who used to live with me know, about once every 3 months I'm destined to try a new room layout. Not sure what chemical reaction in my body causes it, but almost like clockwork. My current room really had no options for alternate layouts so never felt the overwhelming compulsion to change it. New room is a proper 'rectangle' that can be played with anew.

       It's summer, give me a break.  There's 30 days or less until leaving for the playa, give me a break.  I'm moving within the next calendar month to a new place, give me a break.  All things considered I think the fact that I'm remembering that I'm not updating my blog compares admirably with how I've done in the past. With things being as busy as they are my brain hasn't had a lot of time to think about things which I usually enjoy blogging about so even if I were posting it wouldn't be very blogworthy reading I guess.  Noticing more of my friends are on livejournal rather than blogger.com I can't as easily post on their journals and they on mine as they can within their little LJ community so I feel left out. The fact that 95% of said peoples are all living in Toronto exacerbates that sit-ye-ation. *shrug*  This weekend will see first attempt at principle construction of the Camptario dome.&nbsp; 14' tall, 25' wide, hundreds of pounds filled with pride, CAMPTARIO!!! Will post a completed book with me on top after the long weekend. If work requires me to come in on Saturday or Sunday I will be only slightly more than pissed. Monday afternoon I could deal with, but not prime dome-building time.  Back to grindstone so that don't be the case!

      Burning Man is coming! Like a freight train in the night with no brakes coming around a sharp bend downhill....Burning Man is coming! I'm not even close to ready yet, are you?  I think this weekend could have been called the mini-est of mini-burns, but it was still a great long weekend. It called for rain all weekend, but there was only one quick thundershower on Saturday afternoon. With Tiger, Tim, Mike and I plus occasional assistance from Karin, Luis, Paris we got the dome assembled in under 10 hours work - with stops for food, drink, drink, drink. Somehow ended up missing 4 struts, but dome was stable enough to climb, hang things, etc. Would have been made tremendously easier if we had an 8' ladder which we will for the playa. Pictures to be posted later today.  Sunday night we concocted a very low-effort Calabogieman to burn - Mmmmmmm kerosene smell :) I did a little firespinning and firebreathing and then Mike - steadily moving up the ranks of the most wonderful yet craziest people I know list - created one weird game. He & Tiger filled balloons with air / butane and tied them to strings through a little path. We used 'ammunition' aka fireworks to set them off in one section of the course and on the other croquet mallets and flaming rolls of toilet paper. The hardest part was when the bottle rockets went off b/c of the T.P you didn't see them coming but they made the really loud noise. Fun and hilarity.  Monday I set an alarm for 7:15, dragged myself into the lake, then into the car to drive home. Sleep for about an hour, wake up and shower then in to work for 10:30 on a holiday to finish off the knowledge transfer to have the title 'BUILDMASTER' (the guy who pushes the files to where they need to be in the test environment through automated scripts with a funny title). Back to Calabogie by 5pm to find....the dome hasn't even started to be disassembled. Another 4 or 5 hours later we're eating meat sticks and having one last beer before the trek back to city.  The dome is awesome! Once we sort out the fabric (this week) we'll re-test-build this weekend in a park across the street and make sure it fits to spec. We got placed on the 9:00 plaza for BM this year! This is a great spot because it gives us power, is really easy to find as the city dissassembles itself / builds up space, is in a good middle ground as far as loud areas / quiet sleep space, closeness to centercamp b/c it's only 2 or 3 roads in from Esplanade (anything non-registered will be atleast 4 or 5) yet far out that walks in to center camp will be explorations if desired. Oh yeah, and it gives us power for lights, small sound system, blenders, etc. We now really have to make sure this theme camp goes off well so next year we can get as good / better space.  Get the keys to my new apt this evening :) WEEEEEEEE!!!!
