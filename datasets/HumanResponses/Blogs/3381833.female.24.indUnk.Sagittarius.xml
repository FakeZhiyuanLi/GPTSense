      I have been reading the X-Play boards and I have looked at some G4 stuff.  All I gotta say is "Please, please, please!  Adam and Morgan do not become tools of the man!"  I tried a while ago to watch G4 because I love games and X-Play, so it seemed like a no brainer.  I don't remember what I watched, but it seemed...off somehow.  I tried watching Filter the other day, and I don't understand why they have a host(course I'm not a teenage boy looking at a hot chick).  I liked the reviews that X-Play had.  I'm a little hesitant to watch the episodes produced after "the change".  I'm afraid they may be more like the propaganda that is on G4.  I hope they don't change the show.  I hope that everyone still plays the games themselves and reviews are still cool and only biased on rare occasion.  I have a deep dark shameful secret.  *hushed tone*  I...I...I spent the entire day playing Animal Crossing.  I rented from Blockbuster to see if I liked it.  It started simply at first.  Little setting up house, some errands for neighbors, just a simple life.  Then I got bored and started changing the date and time on the system (which I'm sure is just part of playing the game) and then it spiraled out of control.  It started playing at 8:30 in the morning and I played until 6.  Wasted day?  Yes.  But, even now as I sit here I am thinking about how much is left on my debt.  (Damn raccoon!)  I'm starting a "buy Jess an X-box" fund.  I feel I need it to survive...yea, alright I'm spoiled.  It's the only system I don't own.  Which was fine a few years ago, but not now.  Not this year.  The E3 show got me all excited.  Beside I want Knights of the Old Republic!  Sure, it's on the PC, but I want it on X-box.  (I don't trust my computer)  People tell me the words I use are too big and the jokes I tell can only be gotten by a small group of people.  I say these people are recalcitrant (unruly) and need to intensify their internal search for Nirvana.  ( The existential plane, not the grunge band fronted by Kurt Cobain and featuring The Sex God Dave Grohl)  Yea, and screw you.  :p

      I am a chef.  I can now honestly say I am a chef.  I have been hired and I will start next week.  (Score!!!)  It's a new restaurant in my area and they open Wednesday.  I will work nights, which will be cool when I start school to get my Psychology degree in Jan.  I'm very excited.  It will be diffcult to go to school all day and then work till late at night, but it's only for four more weeks.  I miss the X-Play website.  And most of all I will miss Tisha the Web Producer.  I really liked her.  She was funny and cool.     Kisses to my peeps!  (And I love the peeps, the little bunnies, chickies, ghosts...)

      I am not a friendly person.  I am usually quiet and kinda elitist.  Thinking mean things about people in my head, but not telling them.  And, although I know it's wrong, usually I don't like people when I first meet them, they have to prove me wrong for me to want to be friendly.  Having said that, there are people I'm thinking about right now that I tried to be friendly to and now I feel like kickin my own ass.  I am tired of stupid people, I am tired of people that take things so damn seriously, I am tired of damn near everyone I know.  (Not you, the person on the computer looking at the screen) I swear one day I am going to move and not give anyone a forwarding address.  Well, I think that would be very hard, so maybe I will just take a nap.  I have joined a gym (I can hear the shock in everyone's eyes).  I went to three different gyms and the last one won me over.  I went to Curves, cuz I'm a girl and I wanted to know what that was all about.  I wasn't sure it was for me, but the people were nice.  I then went to Gold's Gym.  I received the terrible customer service.  The sales dude was way creepy.  He kept staring and stuff (I know I'm cute, but get a grip!)  I came dressing in my school clothes because I didn't have time to change and when the dude mentioned nutrition I told him (nicely) I know about nutrition.  But he ignored me and just kept stressing it.  There were numerous things, but the point is I left feeling dirty and mishandled.  Then, finally, I went to 24 hour fitness.  OMG, that was like the best.  They had the price I wanted, the people were cool and it just all around rocked.  I feel like I can relax there.  Only problem is that my package means I can only go M, W, F, and Su.  I wanted to go today :(  But I can go tomorrow :)   I also have an interview tomorrow for my internship.  I hope the place doesn't suck.  And if it rocks I hope I get it.  I loves all the pls that read my blog!

      I'm sick!  Which sucks, but what sucks more is that I can't figure out why.  Usually I can pinpoint questionable food or other cause, but this time I guess I'm just sick.  I've been up since 4 in the morning with a terrible stomach ache.  I ate some toast from very old bread, it was in the freezer and smelled liked it.  I don't think it helped.  I had a glass of water, but my cats drank it while I was asleep.  (Fuzzy Bastards!)  So now, I'm feeling a little better, not enough to venture outside or anything, but I'm good enough to game on the couch.  I'm thinkin some Crazy Taxi, maybe a little Crash Team Racing, follow it up with some Final Fantasy X-2.  Or read.  Which sounds sophisticated, until you realize I mean the graphic novels I borrowed from the library (pretty pictures, woooow)  I watched a depressing Sliders.  Bastards got home and left.  They arrived and had 55 seconds till the next Slide so they were trying to figure out if they were home.  They looked at a newspaper and saw OJ charged with double murder and that the Raiders were in the finals.  Then Quinn said that they would know if they were home if the gate in front of his house squeaked.  It didn't, (his mom got it fixed).  They left.  I was pissed.  I never saw that one before.  I remember when they told Sam Beckett he was never going to get home on Quantum Leap, I hated that.  Well, I'm going to go back to moaning pathetically on my couch.

      I love Chili spaghetti.  For those that just don't know, Chili spaghetti is Cincinnati Chili (OMG, I love it!) over spaghetti and topped with Cheddar cheese and oyster crackers.  Sometime I put some chopped onion on it too.  I'm drooling just thinking about it.  I have the chili ready (takes like 2 hours to make) and I am just waiting for the spaghetti to hurry it's ass up.  Carb Friendly?  No. Greasy?  You betcha!  Not for when you feel peckish.  Cincinnati Chili is awesome, it's got cinnamon in it and it's kinda sweet so it goes well on the spaghetti and it's incredible on hot dogs too...I should make one of those too.  It's the freakin' weeken' and I am too fine to deny myself something so good (or anything, which explains the credit card debt)  BTW, if anyone is interested, Kingdom Hearts ain't all that.  It's ok and kinda fun, but I had the impression it was going to be the be all and end all.  Not so...little disappointed.  I hate the little mermaid, which may be why I'm so frustrated with it.  You can only hear Under the Sea so many times.  I think Ariel is the lamest princess.  I'm a Mulan girl, she kicked ass.  I know it's not the most popular Disney movie, but I love it.  Mushu is so damn cute, and funny ("I made you breakfast, and look, it's happy to see you!")  As for the Disney princess I would like to be, it would have to be Sleeping Beauty.  When I was little I used to dance around and sing to all the songs in that movie.  As an Adult I see the point in the movie where you shout at the screen "Don't touch that needle!  Stupid!", but she's under a spell and falls asleep (maybe that's why she's my fav)  We all do silly things when we are little though.  I remember sitting my parents down and telling them I was going to marry Shaggy from Scooby Doo.  I don't think they took me seriously, jokes on them though.  Most of the dudes I've been involved with look like Shaggy.  Before I go, I would like to give a shout out to my girl Quietperson.  She maybe the only one who reads this and I appreciate that.  :)  Thank you for listening to me ramble on about silliness and complain about life.

      Not like, the oppressive man, but the kewl dude kinda man.  It is Saturday, I did a little dance to celebrate.  My cats thought it was cool, and really, isn't that what matters when dance alone in your underwear to Al Green?  (I was obviously too sexy for my cats, so sexy it hurts)  I went to a graduation yesterday and I came to the conclusion that I don't want anyone to come to my graduation.  Not even sure if I'll go.  You listen to 2 or 3 speeches from random people and then listen to 300 names waiting for the one person you know.  I don't think I could anyone through that.  My high school graduation was short, there were only 83 people so that wasn't so bad (and try convincing your parents and grandparents not to come to that).  But my favorite grandparents both passed away and I am not excited about school anymore, so maybe I can get away with skipping it.  Well, keep on keeping on.

      I wouldn't have guessed.  I wonder if he has a MoBlog...  Almost all of the shows I watch have ended for the season.  And Angel has ended for good.  I wasn't impressed, in fact I'm kinda pissed off.  Some of you may have noticed that I changed my template to blue.  Why?  Because I look damn good in blue.  (Brings out my eyes)  I'm in a moderately good mood.  Weird.  This is partly because I had the foresight to buy frozen pizza.  Yes, I know, the culinary student should make a souffle or something...bite me.  It's cheap Totino's pizza.  Brings back memories of walking home from work, wrapping myself in a blanket, playing Legend of Mana, and eating cheap pizza in my tiny apartment.  Good times, good times...  Come to think of it I don't think I ever finished that game.  But that happens alot, I have tons of games that aren't finished.  That reminds me, I captured a pic of Adam Sessler from X-Play and it's currently on my desktop.  It's from April 29th and he's making a face like he's getting ready to kiss someone.  Very hot.  I have no pic posting skills so just try to imagine it.  He looks like he's going in for a quick kiss, not like open mouth tongue hanging out one.  Question before I leave:  How old is too old to spend your entire weekend playing a video game (sun up to sun down)?

      You know, I think I have given up on being happy at work/school.  I hate Mondays and Fridays, but all other days it's like I have just accepted that I will be miserable.  Mondays because they indicate the end of the weekend.  I hate Fridays because they take so long to end.  I end up watching the clock (more than usual).  Today, of course, is Wednesday and that means I am in a haze that makes the whole week seem like one continual day.  It sucks!  To make matters worse I have things that need to be done, but I don't do them because I feel exhausted.  Mentally and physically.  Sure, I do things I enjoy at night, which consists of TV usually (which reminds me, series finale of Angel tonight *sob*), but I don't feel like it's a different day.  Spring is all around, but it is winter in my heart...I think I heard/read that somewhere.  I love winter, but it's a poetry thing.

      You ever had a week were you seemed to piss everyone you come into contact with off.  I am having just such a week.  Which is good because I am not a people person, but bad because it makes the daily grind harder.  People get less work done when they are sulking, which makes me have to work harder.  I think I just need to develop an internal monologue, I don't always realize what came out of my mouth may offend peoples.

      He has that plastic head, you can hurt someone with that thing.  I dyed my hair.  I was trying to go blonde, but I picked up the wrong product.  My hair turned a really pretty red, but not blonde.  Blonde is the only color my hair hasn't been.  I have experimented with reds, different browns, and black.  Last year I put blonde streaks in my naturally light brown hair and that looked really good.  I should have done that again.  Enough about my hair, I had a second interview today for a job at a hospital.  I really want this job, after thinking about it.  My only reservation was that the shift was 5 am to 3pm, but I'll live.  I'm obsessed with sanitation so this would be a great chef job for me.  I won't know till later today and then I have to get the drug test and physical within 24 hours, if I get the job.  I'm really nervous, but when I got home I had a message from a Catholic school looking for a cook.  They want to set up an interview as well.  I'm so popular!  :))  I'm tyed up in knots in my stomach.  I really need to get an externship.  Bye for Now!

      I am really enjoying the gym.  I do 30 min on the treadmill, 20 min on the bike, some reps on weight machines.  Then, I swim, then, finally I relax in the spa pool.  I feel relaxed and invigorated.  But I am the dork of the gym.  The gym has TV screens everywhere and if you have headphones you can listen to the TV from them.  I always watch the Sci-Fi channel.  I am usually the only one watching Star Trek at the gym.  I saw a shirt online that I want to wear when working out, it says "Spock is my homeboy".  My restaurant job fell through.  I worked three days and then they discovered they had hired too many people and had to let people go.  I interviewed somewhere else, but I'm not sure about that one.  I need to find an externship as soon as possible.  I feel super stressed.  I have two more days of school left, then two weeks of summer break, and then 10 school days to find an externship or I will not graduate.  I didn't like Cats.  I fell asleep, unfortunately.  But I looked damn fine.  I have been so busy my DVR is on strike.  I have too many shows recorded and it won't record anymore.  Guess 45 hours isn't enough space.  I feel depressed and stressed.  I need to do something to cheer myself up.  Hence the lack of blog-age.

      I am going to the musical Cats tonight.  I honestly don't know much about what it's about but I'm going to wear a dress and pearls (Instead of my chef uniform or my home uniform of jeans and a t-shirt).  All my cats do is lick themselves and I don't want to sit through three hours of that!  :)  Good to mix it up, got new shoes for the occasion.  Memories are weird things.  I feel like I dwell on my memories too much.  I am always wishing I could go back in time and change things to, hopefully, change my life for the better.  Better decisions, higher paid in my profession, all the good stuff.  And if this was possible I would like to retain my memories of the future so that I can try to keep the good stuff, like the love of my life (who got the tickets to Cats and loves Andrew Lloyd Webber...draw your own conclusions).  I just wanted to blog before I got ready because it had been so long.

      I have 3 weeks left of school.  I don't wanna go tomorrow.  I'm bored out of my wits and I feel miserable the whole time I'm there.  I know I could be doing something way more productive (like, I don't know, working at a real job)  It's free labor for the college, I have to work in the storeroom and I have to look busy all the time.  We still have to wear the whole freakin uniform and there is no air conditioning, I sweat my ass off.  I have gotten myself so worked up I have given myself a stomach ache and will probably not sleep so well tonight. I hate when I do that, but too late now.  I want longer weekends!  I demand it!  I will yawn and stick out my tongue every hour my demands are not met.  They are *ahem* :  Longer weekends, Pizza for lunch everyday, a clean house, no more stupid school tricks, and finally *drumroll* a dozen naturally black roses!  (Raise your hand if you get the joke here :P (Ms. Jackson if you're nasty))  By popular demand,   Things You Can Do With An Eggplant  1) Parmesana 2) Marinate and grill (use lots of oil or it will stick) 3) Put the stem on you head like a hat and pretend to be Herself The Elf 4) Smack someone (or bonk them on the head) 5) Hockey 6) Put in in your pants/bra 7) Make a puppet 8) Turn it into a bong...err..I mean a lamp :)) 9) Give it to a small child and tell them it's an apple from Outer Space 10) Hollow it out and make it your home

      I have made the decision to see Harry Potter at Midnight.  Not the most adult decision I have ever made since I have been up since 6:30 this morning.  Ick!  But I will brave the HP line at 10 (so I can get a good seat)and try to drink some Coke or something to keep myself up.  Must see HP!

      There is this song by Audioslave that I can't remember the name of but every time I hear it I feel sexy.  All the stations have been playing it, it's a couple months old (probably older)...in your house...like a stone...something like that.  I am tired, so tired.  I need a Jess day.  Bubble bath, pedicure, facial, foot massage, all the good stuff.  Every time I make a plan to relax I get sidetracked by the need to clean the house, do laundry, pay bills, and a million other things that need to be done.  I need someone to come and clean my house and do my laundry.  I need a maid, no wait,...I need Rosie from The Jetsons.  Where are the robotic maids I was promised!  (And hoverboards for that matter)  Hell, The Flintstones had funky talking birds to do their bidding.  Unfortunately, nothin' for us folks in the now.  I want to live like Jane Jetson, only with better hair.  I also want sexy shirtless men with six packs feeding me fruit and telling me I'm a goddess, but I think the maids are a priority (Unless we can combine the two....We gotta get someone on that!)  I don't think I am living up to my full goddess potential.  I am a sexy bitch, I just don't think I'm projecting this to the people I meet.  (I don't think the unflattering chef uniform is helping my cause, nor the fact that the chef coats I bought are one size too big)  I need to find a way to be more verbal with my bitchiness.  I usually just stay quiet, not obedient, but quiet.  I need to learn how to be a bitch, but in a cool that chick is strong and smart kinda way, not a damn chica needs a Midol kinda way, or a un-feminine wants to be a dude so bad she can taste the testosterone kinda way either.  Grrr!

      I now realize I'm working for an idiot.&nbsp; I thought I was working&nbsp;for a easy going down to earth chef.&nbsp; No, he's just ignorant.&nbsp; Today he called me in to talk about why I think I'm not fast enough.&nbsp; I wanted to say "Because I'm still learning and I haven't done this before!"&nbsp; I also wanted to shake him.&nbsp; Hard!&nbsp; Instead I told him I didn't know what was slowing me down.&nbsp; He kept saying I should be completely trained now and I should be on top of everything.&nbsp; I am the only cook all morning.&nbsp; I don't have anyone else helping prepare patient's food.&nbsp; The other dude that has been working there for six months has even told the chef that it is too much for one person to do by themselves.&nbsp; Everytime I tried to tell him a problem he pretended it didn't exist (with the one exception being a very minor annoyance, which he kept hitting on like it was something larger).&nbsp; He told me that I will have breakfast ready to go at 6:30 &nbsp;I was like, "What if I don't?" He was like " You will ."&nbsp; So I brought up the whole me not staying after the internship thing.&nbsp; He said it hadn't even occurred to him and that it would be a waste of both of our time if that's what I decided to do.&nbsp; Denial is ugly.&nbsp; I have no reason to stay, I haven't made any friends and it's killing my legs (hands, back, etc.), and he has unrealistic expectations.&nbsp; I am not that slow.&nbsp; I have known slow people in school, I have moments, but as a whole I am not slow.&nbsp; With every problem instead of dealing with it and trying to tackle it head on he decides to pretend it doesn't exist.&nbsp; He is the one at fault for Saturday.&nbsp; What kind of dumbass takes a three day vacation leaving a trainee without a clue on a Saturday (on Saturdays I have to do two peoples work). &nbsp;Friday was groovy (in my opinion), but I knew Saturday was going to be bad.&nbsp; Then to top it off he wrote up everyone who was there Saturday except me!&nbsp; Please, lets breed animosity among the ranks.&nbsp; Grrrr!&nbsp; I am an&nbsp;angry little white woman (not in a big silver box).&nbsp; So anyway....I'm working for an ignorant little self important man with unobtainable goals.&nbsp; Dick!!!   I just thought I would write to help get out the frustration.&nbsp; Thanks to all for listening.

      Saturday was a disaster at work.&nbsp; Nothing went right and it kinda sucked.&nbsp; It went so bad that my boss called yesterday to make sure I was coming in on Wednesday.&nbsp; I assured him I was, but I'm still a little pissed about everything.&nbsp; I have started looking for another job, again.&nbsp; I'm tired of looking for a job.&nbsp; I had really hoped I had found somewhere I would be happy.&nbsp; No such luck.&nbsp; I desperately need a job that makes me happy, or at least has minimal complications.&nbsp; I'm very frustrated.   So I have been spending time cleaning the house and playing The Sims.&nbsp; I don't have a lot of homework, so I have more free time (which would be nice if I wasn't so damn tired all the time).   I wish I had more to write, but I'm kinda depressed.&nbsp;   Kisses!!

      I started my chef job.&nbsp; I only work 4 days a week, which is cool with me.&nbsp; But they are 10 hour days and I am so tired when I get home I don't feel like doing anything but sleeping.&nbsp; One of the worst things about the job is the women I work with.&nbsp; They are these little old ladies and they are evil.&nbsp; I have a tendence to be quiet so they talk to me.&nbsp; All they talk about is how no one pulls their weight but them, how everyone is so beneath them, and random gossip.&nbsp; The most important info I have gotten from these talks is that I am paid less then everyone there.&nbsp; I contribute this to my terrible neigotation tactics.&nbsp; Kinda ticks me off, not to sound high and mighty, but without me there would be no food prepared.&nbsp; I am important!&nbsp; Very important!&nbsp; Adding to this I know that if I hadn't gone to Culinary school and kept my computer job I would be make several dollars more.&nbsp; I'm thinkin' maybe I should try to get a job at another computer company in town.&nbsp; I'm going to University in January for an unrelated subject anyway.  I am sorry I haven't blog recently.&nbsp; I am going to&nbsp; try to blog once a week at least.&nbsp; Probably on Tuesdays from now on.&nbsp;   Peace Out, Peeps!

      I went to see Mean Girls, which I really wanted to see because I heard that Tina Fey did an awesome job with the screenplay.  (I want to read the book it's based on)  Anyway, I enjoyed it, but there were boobs everywhere.  I would be sittin back enjoying the movie and BAM!  Big set of boobs!  Knockers everywhere and on everyone.  It reminded me of the Craft in that respect, lots of chicks w/o bras running in that one.  At least in Mean Girls they were contained.  I could have seen boobies at home!  I start work on Monday.  I work all next week in fact.  I have been trying to get myself ready by waking up earlier and earlier so I won't have as many problems waking up at 3:30 in the morning.  I am so tired!  I will be super tired next week.  Sorry so short, but nothing else to say...bye bye

      Sounds kinda gross when you think about it...  This is from the 4th!  Experienced technical difficulties...  If you know me and were supposed to call me last week, WTF!  (I'm looking at you Kit Kat!)  I got the job at the hospital, contingent on the background check working out.  I will start as soon as the background check is complete.  Good news, bad news...  Good news, I don't have tuberculosis.  Bad news, they had to stick me with a needle to find this out.  I have a horrible, terrible, icky fear of needles.  It's my understanding that some people who shall remain nameless thought I would blow the job because I wouldn't take the TB test.  I remember when I was twelve they gave me a TB test with something that looked like a thumbtack, which still makes me shake thinking about it.  They don't use that anymore.  They use a real needle.  I feel like I should have had more warning or someone to hold my hand.  It was traumatizing!  I was alone in a room hyperventilating.  Everytime a firecracker goes off my cats start trippin.  They are so scared.  They are trying to look as cute as they can so I will protect them from the big loud noise.  One of them is under my couch throw pillows, hiding I guess.  Poor bebes!  I used a credit card to go grocery shopping.  I know I should be ashamed, but I feel good.  I always feel better when there is food in the house.  Whenever I don't have bread and stuff (necessities) I get a little panicked.  I don't know why, I've never gone hungry (knock on wood).  I bought bread!  And cheese!  And...Juice!!!  I feel so good, I could testify right here!  For those that may not have guessed I love food.  That's not to say I overeat, just that I enjoy food.  I love to cook and bake, it feels so good.  Ahhhhhhh, feels so gooooood!

      So after the talk I had with my boss on Thursday I decided to quit and give four weeks notice.  I also let him know that I couldn't work the following day (a Saturday).  I explained to him that I don't want to work Saturdays and that I needed to get paid more.  I told him I would write up my notice and give it to him Wednesday (today), well I left it on the coffee table and when I told him he said he needed to talk to me.  He has offered me Saturdays off but he sounded unsure about a raise.  I am not sure if it's worth it.  I told him I need to think about it.  That's where I'm at right now.  Peace my peeps!
