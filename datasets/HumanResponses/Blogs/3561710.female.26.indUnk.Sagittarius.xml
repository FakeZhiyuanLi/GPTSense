      Well, I've almost made it through the work week...and I am oh-so-ready for the weekend.  I've been working out at The Texas Club this week due to Santa Fe's "remodeling" of the fitness center.  The Texas Club is pretty nice...rather 70s looking, but a rather extensive facility.  Trish and I took a "chisel" class today...and I'm either out of shape (which might be the case) or the other women popped some performance enhancing substances before coming to class...  I think it's time to get back into the "real" gym...I just can't seem to stay away from the hard core lifting for long.  God help me.  And I think I need to give up coffee and diet soda (also known as pop in my former life) as my insulin problems aren't getting any better and I think they are part of the problem.  Boooooo Hooooo :(   Anyhoo, I need to go to sleepy ha ha land....G'nite y'all.

      My patience was tested today at work...and I think I passed.  :)  "This is a test, this is only a test."  At least that's what I keep telling myself.  Oh, I purchased my first Bible yesteday...and for those of you who know me as the woman in black..it is PINK and GREEN!!!  Okay, so maybe a pink and green good book is not as humble as say, the usual brown...but for someone like me who has lived in a world devoid of color, I found it very appropriate.  Now if only I had the money to redo my wardrobe...

      Okay, I wish sugar-free candy had never been invented because it is all I want to eat.  :)  Today is a good day...I'm sorry that I'm not back in Ohio to spend Father's Day with my dad, but I got the chance to talk with him earlier and he knows that I'm sending him my love from Big D.  I went to church and Sunday School this morning and met some great new people (and yes, as an adult, it is very strange for me to say that I go to Sunday School, but it is not at all what I thought it would be).  Trish and I went to lunch afterwards and had a really good time...this Tuesday we're starting to go to a new class on The Purpose Driven Life and I'm really excited about it.    My body still hurts from softball on Friday night...how is that possible?  lol

      As usual, Mom called and woke me up at 8:00 am, but that's okay because I had things to do today anyway.  I am getting old...my body is so tired from playing softball last night.  I played first base...and had a hit every time I was at bat...not bad for the first time in 12 years.  Okay, so I only made it to first base once, but at least I hit the ball.  :)  And I made a few good plays...and a lot of errors, but who's counting?  I may be getting asked back to play tomorrow night...we shall see.  I would, it was a blast.    Went to lunch at Chili's with Alpesh today.  Made a mess eating wings but they were awesome.  Saw "Chronicles of Riddick" as well.  So it wasn't the best theatrical performance Diesel has ever given, but the eye candy wasn't bad.  Not sure what is going on tonite yet...Oh, and Amanda if you read this, CHEER UP!!!  ta ta for now...

      It's Thursday night, and I just finished reading Mitch Albom's "the five people you meet in heaven."  I've been reading The Purpose Driven Life for a week as well, and "five people" reinforces so much of what I have discovered.  Make every day count.  Time to take g-dog for a walk...nitey nite.

      It's Saturday, July 24th, and I still don't have the #@%*#$! dress for Jen's wedding on August 14th...it's in three weeks.  I ordered it on March 31st.  This is just a little rediculous.  And I'm stressed because I ordered the dress the size I would have been had I competed in Figure, and let's just say that I'm not that small.  Whoops.  So...I'm hitting the gym and dieting my a$$ off literally.  :)  So far so good...the trip to Toronto set me back a bit, but I have fully recovered.  I'm actually happy with myself the way that I am, but it's just that I don't want to have to pay for another dress...and heck, that's not even possible this late in the game, so I get to kill myself for the next three weeks.  :)  I've realized that yes, I am very allergic to Wheat...so that is a major no-no, and I'm just following a diet for Insulin Resistance, so I'm actually making myself healthier in the process...I'm eating what I'm supposed to be eating...good proteins, veggies, fruit, and good fats like flax oil, which is actually pretty gross.  lol  I'm just praying that God will give me the strength to make it through the next few weeks without any outrageous cravings.  Anyhoo, I'm looking forward to going home and seeing the friends and family.  Hasta la bye bye.  :)

      Well, I just got back from Toronto...My buddy Matt called me on Thursday and asked me what I was doing over the weekend, I told him not much so he asked me if i wanted to fly up to Toronto to go to a wedding with him...so I did!  I booked my ticket at 7:00 pm Friday night and was in Canada at noon the next day.  The wedding was awesome...probably one of the nicest I've ever been to...great food, great people, just beautiful.  I can't believe I lasted as long as I did that night considering that I didn't go to bed on Friday night...I had finished packing at midnight and had to get up at 3:30 to leave for the airport at 4:15.  I am suffering from lack of sleep, but it was well worth it.  To quote someone I know, "You can sleep when you're dead."  lol  One of the best things about the trip was my layover in Detroit on the way home.  My mom and Uncle Tom drove up from Toledo to come visit me.  We ate a very pricey yet very tasty lunch at the Westin Hotel, and then I was on my merry way back to Big D.  Amanda picked me up at the airport and we went to Cuba Libre for din din.  Well, gotta go, getting attacked by Georgia..she needs some lovin'.  Bye y'all!!!

      And who knows what I'm doing!!!  I'll be hitting the gym tonite in a bit, and probably laying low.  I found out today that my thyroid dose is too high, and that they have to lower it.  Odd, since I've actually GAINED weight since starting on my medication, but I have been ravenous, fatigued, irritable, etc., all side effects of hyperthyroidism...i'm sure you really wanted that info, but this is MY journal, right?  Anyhoo, this week at work actually ended on a good note...after a week from Hades, this one was much better.  I got to process blood today, how exciting.  I used to do it at the animal hospital all the time, so it was fun to get to do that again.  I've had a pretty busy week...I went to Bible study on Tuesday with my group of awesome chicas, and then had a meeting about helping out with VBS on Wednesday.  I'm going to be a busy girl this summer, but busy is good.  My diet has been better this week, which is a good thing, since Jen's wedding is 6 weeks away from tomorrow, and I'm hoping that the dress will fit...  Oh well.  Tomorrow, I'll probably try to view the downtown fireworks from the roof of my building, and then maybe hit the Hollow/Strangleweed show at Curtain Club.  I haven't seen them live in over 6 months, so that should be fun.  Sunday I'm heading over to the Cook's new casa for a BBQ...and Monday I am going to relax and thoroughly enjoy my day off from work.  Well, ta ta for now.  Later peeps.

      Last night Amanda and Amy and I hit Lower Greenville in honor of Amanda's Birthday....and what a night it was.  We hopped from bar to bar, made all the hot guys kiss Amanda in honor of her birthday, and fed her little more to drink than we probably should have, but hey, you only turn 28 once, right?  Today I'm nursing a hangover...my first in months, as I've been a good girl and haven't been out in ages.  Later today I have to go pick up the dress from the tailor shop...it better fit like a glove after spending 150 bucks on alterations.  I think that tonite I'll be going to the Southwest USA Bodybuildng Show...I just can't seem to stay away from that stuff.  I'm feeling pretty good these days so I'm exciting about going.  I don't think I'll ever be gracing the stage again anytime soon, but I still love the sport.  Carrie and Elizabeth will be there, and I haven't seen them in a month or so, so it will be good to catch up.  I"m excited to be going home next week...this was a crazy week at work, but it all turned out great.  And I even got to pick up one of my hollywood patients at their hotel yesterday, which makes my job a little more interesting.  It's a rather strange experience to have an actor that you've seen on the big screen sitting just a few inches away from you and having a conversation with them.  I've been at my job for so long that I'm no longer "star struck" but it is still makes me a little nervous.  I fly home  Wednesday morning and get into Toledo around 3:30 in the afternoon...I can't wait to see the fam.  I'm still tossing around the idea of going back to school, but I guess I just have to see where God wants me to be.  Well, I suppose I should eat some breakfast and get my booty in gear for the day.  I'm a lazy bum.  Oh, and I actually lifted at the gym yesterday for the first time in a long time as well.  I have been a cardio queen, but I sure have missed the iron.  :)

      I'll be back in Toledo in a little over a week for Jenny and Todd's wedding.  I finally got the dress...I thought it was going to be a lot worse as far as fitting goes, but once I have it altered it will be just fine.  I've been tanning, Brannon will be coloring my hair, and my teeth are whiter...I can't go home looking too terrible.  Now I just get to eat healthy and take care of myself for the time being and I'll be good to go.  Oh, and this weekend was good.  Friday I went rollerblading around White Rock Lake with Trish.  It was the first time I'd been blading since I've lived in Texas.  It was awesome.  And Saturday night we took a big group of kids to a Ranger's game.   My clothes were stuck to me...it was incredibly hot and humid...but it was a lot of fun.  :)
