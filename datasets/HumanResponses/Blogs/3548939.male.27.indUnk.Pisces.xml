      The June 16th issue of the Seattle Times carried several letters to the editor that really made my blood boil.  For those not familiar with our situation, Washington State has for many decades had a "blanket primary" system.  Voters could vote for whomever they wanted in the primary election, regardless of candidates' political affiliations.  The top vote-getter in each party would then advance to the general election.  The state's political parties have recently become dissatisfied with this system, and they have had it struck down by the courts, so now we have to come up with a new system.  The system closest to what we had before would be a "top-two" system, where all candidates appear on the primary ballot and the top two vote-getters advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation.  The Washington State Grange has begun an initiative drive to institute this type of primary.  But our dear Governor Gary Locke, who has waffled on just about every other important issue facing the state,  has for once decided to stand firm and impose on us a system referred to as a "Montana" primary:  each voter must choose one party's ballot and can only choose among that party's candidates.  He has done this, so he claims, because a top-two system would limit voter choice in the general election.  Well, guess what, Gary?  If it's lots of choices you want,  vote in the primary !  Anyway, back to the letters.  When Grangers cross over and cherry-pick from candidates of several parties, they corrupt the process and deny general election voters a diversity of choices, leaving choices between only Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum (Burt Talcott, Gig Harbor).   Silly me--it seemed to me it was the parties who were corrupting a perfectly workable system.  Again, if you want choice, vote in the primary.   I am tired of the endless debate, and the accompanying whining, over our primary system. If you want to vote, you need to affiliate with a party. If you do not, then this portion of the election is not available to you. Period.   This is the whole idea of a primary; people of like-mindedness choose who they want to present on the final ballot to the entire state. This is how Oregon and almost every other state has always done it; our old system is radically different (Scott Santos, Snoqualmie).   That may be the "whole idea of a primary" elsewhere, but it's not how our system works.  We are not Oregon, nor any other state.  We are unique.  In Washington, there are no party members but those who identify themselves as such at any given moment (we do not register voters by party).  For this Washingtonian, the real point of a primary election is  not  to pick parties' nominees for them; the point is merely to narrow the field of candidates, with any luck, down to the best ones, who can then duke it out in the general.  The party label that appears next to a candidate's name on the ballot is more a symbol of political philosophy than an oath of political allegiance--for candidates, as for everyone else in the state, party affiliation is whatever they choose to say it is.  The parties have been such insufferable pills throughout this whole mess that maybe it's time to cut them out of the system altogether.  And the surest way to do that would be simply to make all statewide offices in Washington nonpartisan, an idea I find more appealing every day.  Fight for your uniqueness, Washington!

      A while back, someone asked me what makes Northwesterners different from other North Americans.  I didn't really know what to say, since I think people are, deep down, pretty much the same all over the world.  Nevertheless, there is a certain hard-to-put-your-finger-on-it something about the region and its people that cries out for elucidation.  So, recognizing the contradictions involved and aware that broad-brush characterizations of diverse populations generally reveal more about the commentator than about the people, I'm going to attempt a little theorizing about what makes us tick.  In addition to the coffee, the weather, and the SUVs, the shape of the land we call home has to rank as one of the more profound influences on the Northwest psyche.  First, for Europeans spreading westward from the eastern parts of the US and Canada, the Northwest represents the end of expansion, the "last frontier", the edge of the world.  On the other hand, our perceptions are also shaped by the fact that, from most places in the region, the land does not go to the horizon.  Depending where you are, your world is always bounded, whether by mountains, by forest, or by sea.  As a native Northwesterner currently living in the flatlands of the Great Lakes region, I find that it makes me vaguely uneasy to see land meeting sky on all sides, to think about the miles of uninterrupted earth surrounding me, to realize just how far I am from truly open water.  I have talked to other Northwesterners who have experienced the same feeling.  We want to be cradled in the palm of the earth's hand, to feel that our small portion of the universe is all there is.  Thus we are always both at the edge of the world and at its center.  Our relationship to the ocean is a complex and important one.  To an extent almost unique in the world, in Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska the sea winds its way around the islands and peninsulas, right up to our doorsteps.  On the outer coast, meanwhile, the ocean is a force to be reckoned with.  And as we look out over that immense expanse of water, we know that on the other side is Asia, to which we are the gateway.  Finally, I like to think the land teaches us a sort of humility.  One cannot confront an earthquake, an ancient tree, the vast expanse of the ocean, a surging waterfall, a 10,000-plus-foot volcano--things with which we are in daily contact--without a sense that we humans are not in control, that we are merely part of something much larger than ourselves.  And I like to think that we are learning to appreciate these forces on their own terms, that there is value in recognizing our own smallness.  Those who want to explore the relationship between Northwesterners and their land further may be interested in the writings of  urlLink David McCloskey .

      I'm an expat Northwesterner, currently in exile in the flatlands for educational purposes.  When I miss the sea, the forests, the mountains, the wildflowers, so much I can't stand it anymore, I go check out  urlLink Lee Mann 's website.  Some of his photographs are so powerful, I feel like I could cry--and, just occasionally, I've been known to do just that.

      Why would anyone join a Northwest regional independence movement?  Well, why shouldn't we be independent?  Why should we have important decisions made for us thousands of miles away?  Why should our region, with its distinctive culture, remain divided between two faceless, culture-leveling, continent-girdling empires?  I can't help but feel that the United States as we know it may have outlived its usefulness.  For one thing, I think recent events have shown that the world's current one-superpower system is not tenable in the long term.  A system in which one large country thinks it can do whatever it wants without consulting anyone else is dangerous.  Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.  The U.S. is just so big, many people seem to mistake it for the whole world.  This promotes insular thinking, and the time for that is past.  It's time we started engaging with the world on a personal level, and I think we in the Northwest can be leaders in that regard.  Independence isn't what it used to be.  Making decisions for ourselves doesn't have to mean severing ties with the rest of North America.  I'd like to see a North America that looks more like the EU, with maybe a dozen independent countries sharing a common currency, defense apparatus, and border patrol, but each free to develop its own culture and its own ties to other countries.

      OK, so I watch way too much Food Network.  It's really about the only channel on TV that consistently has something watchable on.  Anyway, last night their  urlLink Food Finds  show featured the  urlLink Mt. Angel Brewery , in Mt. Angel, Oregon.  Beer, barbecue, and they also make pop, including distinctive Willamette Vally flavors like Marionberry and hazelnut.  For more Oregon breweries, check out the  urlLink Oregon Brewers' Guild .

      I’m no revolutionary.  At their roots, I think the sorts of democratic systems we enjoy today in the U.S. and Canada are good ones.  I consider myself an independent (though most folks would probably place me just a bit left of center), and I have voted for both Democrats and Republicans in the past.  Part of the purpose of this website is to give a moderate voice to the idea of political reorganization, at all levels.  I want people to know that you can love peace, freedom, democracy, Mom, baseball, and apple pie, and still think that Canada and the U.S., as currently conceived, do not make sense as political units.  Contemplating fundamental changes to our geopolitical landscape should not be the sole province of the utopians, or the anarchists, or the survivalists, or the white supremacists.  It’s something we should all be thinking about.  But  why  should we want to alter these boundaries?  Simple.  Because government should be  of the people .  Political entities should be extensions of communities of people, not drawn up by governments thousands of miles distant, and certainly not imposed by the dead hand of short-sighted nineteenth-century politics.  The basic principle seems reasonable enough:  whenever possible, political boundaries should be where people aren’t.  The fact is, though, most of the political boundaries in the Northwest were drawn long before the eventual patterns of settlement in the region became obvious.  But now that things are clearer, now that we should know better, the lines have become ingrained, and our thinking has become ossified.  Could somebody please tell me why Idaho makes sense as a political entity today?  I doubt many people have even tried to rationalize why Coeur d’Alene should be in the same state as Pocatello, rather than Spokane.  That’s just the way it is.  One short-sighted nineteenth-century tactic that has distorted our geopolitical landscape is the use of rivers as political boundaries.  In the short run, when there are not many people around, rivers make convenient boundaries because they are easy to see and, initially, hard to cross.  But in the long run, rivers make crappy political boundaries, because they  concentrate  settlement along their banks.  Eventually we end up with communities, like Portland-Vancouver or Lewiston-Clarkston, with state lines running right through the middle.  The disconnect between community and political geography grows, and government seems that much more abstract and irrelevant.  Straight lines make bad boundaries, too, especially in mountainous areas.  Indiscriminate use of straight-line political boundaries has led to a situation in which residents of a number of areas (western Jefferson County, northeastern King County, eastern Whatcom County, to take some Washington State examples) where the residents cannot even drive to their own county seats without driving long distances through other counties.

      Welcome to Cauria Online.  This blog is dedicated to exploring the history, nature, and culture of the Pacific Northwest.  It is also dedicated to the project of building cross-border cooperation and regional identity in our region, which is currently divided between the United States and Canada, and to investigating the possibility of eventually establishing a united and independent country in the Northwest.  OK, so what the heck is “Cauria”?  Cauria is my name for the greater Pacific Northwest region.  The name is intended to be my small contribution to the establishment of a common regional identity.  It is derived from the Latin word  caurus , meaning ‘northwest wind’, or simply ‘northwest’.  There are some other names for the Northwest region floating around out there, but they seem to refer to slightly different areas.  “Ecotopia” comes from a book by Joel Garreau; as I understand it, “Ecotopia” would include Northern California but would not include Alaska or any part of Canada.  Now, I have nothing against Northern California.  I have friends and relatives there.  I enjoy spending time there.  But it’s not part of the Pacific Northwest.  I would only consider a very limited part of what is now California to be part of the Northwest:  Eureka and Yreka?  Sure.  Redding?  Maybe.  San Jose?  No way.  Plus, I think part of the main point of the Northwest regional movement is to bring Northwesterners in the U.S. and Canada together.  The term “Cascadia” seems to have as many definitions as there are people using it.  Some would include only Washington and Oregon.  Others use it in a very narrow sense, referring only to an area west of the Cascades between Vancouver, B.C., and Eugene, Oregon.  Many versions exclude Idaho and western Montana; very few include Alaska or the Yukon.  I would consider all of these areas to be part of the Northwest.  “Cauria” is specifically intended to include not only Washington State, Oregon, and British Columbia, but also Idaho, western Montana, the Grand Tetons area of Wyoming, the northwestern corner of California, the Yukon Territory, and Alaska.  Basically, it encompasses all of North America west of the Rocky Mountains and north of the Great Basin and the Sacramento Valley.    Besides, I think it sounds nice.
