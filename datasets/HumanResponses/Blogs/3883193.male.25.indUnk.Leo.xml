      It was hot as hell, and humid, but it was dark out. The thick canopy above and all around created an eerie sort of mid-day twilight. I was lost, I knew that now, and my utter ill-preparedness left me without map or compass. The only thing to do was to wander around aimlessly until I&nbsp;happened to stumble upon&nbsp;some sort of landmark that I recognized, or&nbsp;until I&nbsp;gave up from exhaustion.&nbsp;The heat was starting to get to me, the sweat dripped down into my eyes and blurred my vision. I was beginning to think that maybe I wouldn't make it. That's&nbsp;when I saw it, a vision of beauty itself standing before me. It was my front door, I was safe.   I was lucky this time, and I knew that if I didn't do something soon, I may not be so lucky next time. There could be no more denial, no more self delusions. I had to admit it to myself now before it was to late, before something went terribly awry. I had to admit to myself that I had a weed problem.   Now this wasn't your normal run of the mill weed problem. Oh no, this was something far darker. This was your typical mutant, genetic anomaly, freak of nature, glow in the dark weed problem and after the days events I knew that it was either them or me. So,&nbsp;I went down to my local hardware store and bought 2 bottles of round-up. For those of you who have used&nbsp;round up before, you&nbsp;know that it is serious stuff.&nbsp;Round-up&nbsp;is&nbsp;not&nbsp;just for pansies. It's for pansies, milk weed, clover, thistle and just about every other form of life&nbsp;unfortunate enough to find itself classified&nbsp;under the flora kingdom.&nbsp;So I figured that all I had to do was spray and wait as the jungle in front of my house withered and died. I was wrong. I emptied both bottles of round-up and still (after 3 days)&nbsp;the weeds persist and they look as healthy as ever. I WILL NOT be defeated however. These monstrosities will be stopped. Obviously I was a fool to think that round-up would do the job, next time I will go for the kerosene. I'll dowse the entire jungle with it and roast marshmallows until there is&nbsp;nothing left. I will win!!

      Can I get an Alleluhah! (Alleluhah!) I said can I get an Alleluhah!! (Alleluhah)! Ladies and Gentlemen welcome, the one, the only Reverend...... Horton..... Heat!!!! (Amen!! *cheers*). Or at least that how the concert&nbsp;SHOULD have started, complete with Gospel Choir and&nbsp;all. I'm not completely&nbsp;sure how the Reverend finally took the stage in reality, the details tend to become a bit hazy when one&nbsp;has indulged in&nbsp;four scotches on the rockses, but I do remember there being a killer stand-up bass, with&nbsp;red-stained wood flame inlays, an impressive collection of 1930's&nbsp;chrome microphones and a man with a greaser hairdo in a silver zoot suit with embroidered blue flames on the Sleeves. I am only an amateur Reverend Horton Heat fan, especially compared to some of the hardcore fans, but the concert was quite enjoyable. There was plenty of Rock-A-Billy swing dancing&nbsp;and moshing to go around. Sometimes even Rock-A-Billy swing combined with moshing, which, I must admit, I have never&nbsp;seen before.   The REAL reason I went to the concert,&nbsp;&nbsp;was for the opening Band the  urlLink Detroit Cobras &nbsp;(

      It started out like any other Monday night, I had just finished teaching swing dance lessons, had thanked everyone for coming and implored them to stick around and enjoy some 2-dollar well drinks, even though they never do (The Blues Bouquet needs the business). I&nbsp;danced&nbsp;one more dance with my&nbsp;friend K to Indigo Swing's "My baby just cares for&nbsp;me" and then decided to call it a night.&nbsp;On my way out I stopped to say goodnight to the DJ, M. M says to me that this will probably be her last night DJ'ing for us because the evil Nazi new owners (she didn't really call them that)&nbsp;of the Blues bouquet are making everyone re-interview for their jobs when they take over.   I think that M will keep her job, and I think that if the new owners get rid of any of the current staff they are making a BIG mistake. The Staff of the Blues bouquet really enjoy their job there and, as such, are very dedicated to it. Where most bars in Boise&nbsp;have a quick waitressing turn around, maybe a couple months, pretty much all of the staff of the Blues bouquet have been working there since I moved to Boise (and probably much longer). I don't think that anyone there has anything to worry about.   The thing that worries me (other than the loss of jobs) is what the fate of Swing Night will be. Currently Swing Night is probably one of the busier nights at the Blues Bouquet, but that isn't saying much. Even the busiest&nbsp;nights at the Blues Bouquet draw a crowd that is pretty pathetic when compared to a slow night at some of the other successful bars in Boise. It would be a shame to lose Swing Night at the Blues Bouquet, not only because it is one of the only places that caters to swing dancers (and THE only place that teaches Lindy Hop on a regular basis) but because it has been around every Monday for almost&nbsp;3 years now. Well, who knows, maybe  urlLink The Neurolux &nbsp;will decide to take us swing dancers in if we suddenly find ourselves without a home. I think this would be an excellent place to move to but the clientele kind of make me nervous there. They are so "hip" and "with it." At any rate, I'm glad that I kept my day job.

      Maybe its the result of too many summer days floating the Boise River&nbsp;or too many winters days sliding the slopes of  urlLink Bogus Basin  ski resort that have drawn me away from my nerdy roots. My techno-gadgetry collection has fallen into a sorry state of outdatedness and disrepair. My computer (or should I say door stop) is a shameful&nbsp;6 years old and makes a strange sort of whinny sound when I&nbsp;turn it on, though it doesn't do much else.&nbsp;My laptop,&nbsp;although&nbsp;in a better state than my desktop, has a broken CD-Rom, a stolen network card, and a habit of mysteriously shutting down at inopportune moments. My PDA which, at its height of geekyness,&nbsp; donned the pocket version of Linux, no longer seems to do much of anything, I've tried whacking it many times, to no avail (I just realized how utterly WRONG that sounds, oh well, it stays).  &nbsp;  Today, with fond memories of high-tech LAN parties in mind, I decided that I must take action.&nbsp; I went ahead and purchased a new HP pavilion zx5000 wide screen edition laptop, including all&nbsp;of the bells and whistles,&nbsp;with wireless photoprinter&nbsp;and docking station. Now I will be able to get my game on in style, no matter where I happen to be, AND it was absolutely free! ...... Well, absolutely free for 12 months. In fact they actually paid me to take it off their hands, yay for mail-in rebates! So, thanks to consumerism I am now comfortably further in debt (those suckers just keep giving me money). I better go watch "Fight Club" again before I go and buy something I  urlLink REALLY  don't need. Curse you eBay!! You make stylish retro-modern living way&nbsp;too easy.

      There is an unseen epidemic plaguing young Americans today and something has to be done. Everyday, 20-somethings everywhere are losing good friends. You think to yourself "Nah, it'll never happen to someone I know, we're all young, invincible, and carefree" but eventually the unimaginable happens. One day while you're minding your own business, rocking along to the Juvenile (yet strangely appealing) riffs of Tenacious D, you get the news; "I'm engaged!"  &nbsp;  It happened to me, yet again, today in the form of an e-mail from my college friend H. My initial response was "*squeal like a school girl* congratulations!!" After all, that's what you do when you hear someone is engaged, but there was a sort of underlying sadness. Not because I was losing a friend (though I really should keep in touch more), but because I realized that those that fall victim to this epidemic are finding true love while the rest of us have love lives like something out of "Seinfeld".  &nbsp;  So, to all of those people out there with healthy, stable relationships, I thought I would give you a little taste of what you are missing. Here are some of my recent answers to questions like "How'd the date go last night?" or "What ever happened between you and *insert name here*?":   "She's extremely antisocial."  "She's cynical as hell, by the end I was too depressed to move."  "She wouldn't stop talking about shaving her brother's legs."  "She's racist."  "She's too judgmental."  "She's both racist and too judgmental."  "She's perfect, just my type....... but I'm not interested"  "She's perfect, just my type....... but she's not interested"  "She's perfect, just my type....... but she's only interested in me when she's drunk"  "She's okay, but I'm really not into leashes, spiked collars and latex clothing."  "She always has someplace vague and mysterious that she must go to in the middle of our dates and said place does not allow for company."  "It turns out that she was actually 37 when she told me she was 26."  "It turns out she was fooling around with everyone in town that has an internet connection."  "It turns out that she is a&nbsp;compulsive liar. She said that she was getting help, but for some reason I don't believe her"   Finding someone that you can put up with for the rest of your life and whom, in turn, can put up with you is much harder than it sounds. So H, here's to you and to those that make it look easy because deep down we all know that its not. Congratulations and believe me, you aren't missing much!!

      This may sound odd, but nothing restores my faith in humanity like a good punk rock show. Sure, most of the time the lyrics are terrible (I know, there are a few exceptions here) and forget trying to have meaningful conversation with anyone (the music is way to loud for any of the conventional forms of communication). However, in my opinion, you will never find a more diverse and accepting crowd of people than the audience at a punk rock show. Nowhere else will you see a guy with a 2 foot tall blue Mohawk enjoying the company of a guy that looks like he belongs in a Banana Republic advertisement.   A lot of people believe that punk shows are just for kids, and perhaps adults that have a lot of growing up to do, but I really disagree. Sure, there is a lot of chaos in a punk mosh pit at its height of revelry and sure, things can sometimes go wrong, but I always know that at a Punk Rock show, if I go down, I am always surrounded by complete strangers that will instantly help me back up. In a world where a person will walk by another who is begging for help (even if it's just a dollar to pay for a hot meal) without even acknowledging their existence, I think there is a lot to learn from the sort of community that can be had at a good punk show. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the philharmonic or the opera as much as the next guy but I know that when I am there, I am isolated, only in the company of those that I came with. &nbsp; In the words of The Dropkick Murphy's "It doesn't take a big man to knock somebody down, just a little courage to lift him of the ground"

      I used to think that Sarah Mchlachlan's song "Better than ice cream" was really sweet (for those of you unfamiliar with the song check out the lyrics here:  urlLink Better Than Ice cream lyrics . Read them and say to yourself awwwwww, that's so sweet.) However, it occurred to my last night, in one of the slightly drunken meanderings of the mind that I call thought, that "Your love is better than ice cream" is not really saying much. I mean I've had really lame conversations with complete strangers that are better than ice cream, let alone love. If you find yourself suddenly thinking "Hey you know what? Most of the time, I'd rather have a heaping scoop of Rocky Road than be in love, but for you I'll make an exception" then you must really have a dull love life (even duller than mine, if that's physically possible).  Who knows, maybe there is an ice cream out there that is better than love, or at least better than  some love. If there is, I'd really like to know where to get it because it would probably be a lot easier to find than real love, and a whole lot less expensive too.

      "I hope you read this." That was the title of J's e-mail to me. I never really wanted to hear from her again, I just wanted to get her out of my mind and into my past but she is back in town. She told me what she had been through since we had last spoken and it sounds like a lot. She sounds like a new person. I will not believe her though, not this time, I have heard too many lies and been hurt too many times to ever believe her again. I can only view what she wrote me as a curious fiction, perhaps a story of the person that she wants to be, perhaps a story of the person she thinks I want her to be, but whatever it is, it is not truth. I have seen the way she burns her bridges, the way she uses up friends, family, lovers until there is nothing left. I can tell that she had burned her last bridge in California, and used up the last person that reached out to her there and that she is in need of a friend. A true friend, or another friend to use up, this I don't know. Even if I did know I'm no longer sure how to be one to her and not the other.  When I was young, my mother and I used to have fierce fights. We have "philosophical differences" on how to live life (your average parent-child relationship). One of these arguments in particular left us both worn and drained, and I was on the verge of giving up. She told me to put my hands out and she hit them away, then she told me to put them out again, and she hit them away again. She kept asking and I kept reaching out, and then she stopped asking and I kept reaching out. "That" she said "Is what love is."  I have never since heard an explanation of the nature of love that is so simple and clear. We reach out to the ones that we love, knowing that we will get hurt and that we will be pushed away, expecting to get hurt and pushed away. Regardless, we continue to reach out to them because we love them and we know that they need us to reach out to them and offer our support even if they can't always say it.  I can't speak for everyone, but I myself have my breaking point. I could lie to myself and say that I am trying to help her by showing her that she can't expect to rebuild a friendship after sucking it dry, but I know that isn't quite true. The truth is, I am tired of being hurt, and I have complete confidence that J will hurt me again. God knows that I have been the cause of my fair share of pain in my life and it would definately do me good to reach out a little more but I'm not sure I have it left in me to be the friend that she needs. Perhaps I don't love her anymore, but I don't think I will write her back.

      Last weekend was the  urlLink Seattle Lindy Exchange  and, seeing as the swing dancing scene is Boise is so lacking it makes me want to cry, I decided to make the 7 hour journey to Seattle to dance with some real lindy hoppers. I myself, am just a wannabe, fake lindy hopper, these exchanges always remind me of that. However, I am much better at pretending now than I used to be and can now comfortably dance with anyone that asks without having to worry about stepping on toes.  I pulled into Seattle Friday evening and met up with my friend R, who, along with some of his friends, I would be staying with. R used to live in Boise and is thinking of moving back for school. I think it would be great if he moved back, R is a really nice guy and a great dancer and Boise definitely is in need of both. Anyway, we headed to the first exchange venue and I felt immediately at home. We still had an hour until the first event was scheduled to start and already the dancing had begun. A group of people had brought their car around and were playing music through open windows as they blues danced in the rain. That's just how hardcore fanatical lindy hoppers are, rain never hurt anyone and besides, we would all be sopping wet after dancing all night anyway.  The next two days were great fun. I met a lot of new people and saw a lot of familiar faces, it was really good to be surrounded by people who were as passionate about swing dancing as I am. It's nice to have someone join in when I subconsciously start doing the Charleston in the grocery store rather than stare at me like I'm crazy (this is usually how it goes in Boise).  I stayed a lot later than I should have on Sunday, there was an outdoor dance that afternoon and I was having too much fun. Finally, I left at 4:30, which would put me into Boise at about 2AM. I danced with R once before I left (which convinced me that I have a lot to learn when it comes to being a follow) and wished him luck in his decision.  Over the past 3 nights I have gotten a total of maybe 10 hours of sleep and now I am beyond tired. I have gotten to that stage where my body has given up on trying to put me to sleep and everything just sort of spins around if I try to move. That, combined with the "happy" feeling induced by all of the caffeine that I have had today is strangely like being drunk. It was well worth it though and I can't wait 'till my next swing dancing weekend (I think there is one next month up in Moscow, ID ^_^).

      Yesterday was first Thursday. For those who don't know, on the first Thursday of every month all of the art galleries in town stay open extra late, serve free wine and hors d'oevres, and have live music. On this particular first Thursday I started out at the  urlLink Boise Art Museum  with my friend C. The main reason that I wanted to go to the art museum was to see the much hyped Edgar Degas exhibit. The exhibit consisted mainly of bronzed sculptures of naked women doing various things (none of which were particularly interesting) and horses. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. The only sculpture of Degas that I found remotely interesting was of a horse that was leaning forward as if straining to pull something very heavy. Luckily there were some interesting exhibits by John Grade and William Morris so the visit was not a complete bust. These exhibits featured organic seaform-like sculptures and colorful blown glass with tribal undertones. Incidentally, William Morris studied under Dale Chihuly (one of my favorite modern artists) who's influence could definitely be seen.  After the museum trip C and I decided to hit some of the galleries downtown. Most of the local art here in Boise consists of westernish landscapes and, again, horses. The free wine, however, more than made up for the lack of imagination and soon we were quite tipsy. After a while, the galleries were closing and C had to get up for work tomorrow. I bid C goodnight and, seeing as I had taken Friday off, decided to close out the night with some scotch and techno dancing at  urlLink China Blue .  I ordered my drink at the bar and headed over to the dance floor and was caught off guard. She was beautiful! Beautiful in that unconventional, hard to notice but once you do you can't keep your eyes off her sort of way. She was dancing in a way that was not showy, she was dancing as if she was connected to the music, she was dancing alone, for herself and she was beautiful. I watched her for a while, exchanging smiles as I enjoyed my scotch and after a few songs she went to pick up her bag and headed out the door smiling at me the whole time. I hope this was a "he's kind of cute" sort smile rather than a "maybe if I smile and maintain eye contact the freak that has been watching me all night won't try to follow me" sort of smile. At any rate hopefully next time I run into her I will have enough of my wits about me to actually say something rather than stand there with a stupid grin on my face.

      I must confess. I went mountain biking yesterday with N at  urlLink Brundage Mountain  and, after 4 hours of biking, I didn't even break a sweat. How is this possible you ask? Chair lifts!! I have never been mountain biking at a mountain with chair lifts before and, I am ashamed to say, I liked it. I REALLY liked it. It was all high speed, adrenaline inducing fun with none of the "I really wish I was somewhere else right now", "When will the hurting stop?" hard work. I fear, however, that this may reduce a healthy, character building hobby into the exercise equivalent of sitting in front of the TV for hours on end. I must be very careful so that I don't get too dependent on biking with chair lifts. God knows I definitely have an  urlLink addictive   urlLink personality .
