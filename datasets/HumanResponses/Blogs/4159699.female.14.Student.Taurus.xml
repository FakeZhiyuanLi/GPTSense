       Good Afternoon everyone! Today my madre (spanish for mother, I'm not spanish or anything, i just like to call her that) woke me and my little sister Paige up at 8:30 in the morning to go to yard sales and stuff. We also went to this cool store in Newport called Dots. In there I got a shirt and some plastic chunky bracelets. We then went to a thrift store where I got 2 pairs of boots for 4 bucks, how awesome is that? Then we stopped in AmeriStop and I got a Starbucks Caramel Frappuchino. I hope I can go to the mall later so I can buy these 2 vampire books I want.      My sister leaves to go to her father's house at 2. I have no plans today. I would usually go over my cousinm Ally's house, but we aren't on speaking terms right now. She hasn't been being very nice to me and she's always depressed and angry at everyone. It's really tough to deal with and be around most of the time because I want to have fun and I'm trying to get better. Hopefully she'll wake up and realize that she misses me then she'll get over herself and call me. Until then I'll just sit around the house and maybe watch "Breakfast At Tiffany's". Hmm...that's all for now. Ta Ta.   you know you love me,   Spazz      STATS:   the book for school: still only on page 8, i'm screwed!   wearing: blue jeans with a red sundress over it, and my new bracelets.   thinking: about how my foot is asleep   listening: to Good Charlotte, my fav band!

       Why hello everyone! As you can tell, this is my first post, how exciting. Not really that exciting, but o.k. High School starts the 19th. Did I metion that I'm a nervous wreck? Cause I am! 9th grade is...scary! What if I get beat up? What if my classes are to hard? EEK! I'm in all the AP classes, the problem with that is that I'm pretty lazy. I'm supposed to read "The Chosen" before school starts, there's going to be a test over it on the first day. I'm so screwed, I'm only on page 8. It's just so...boring.      LaLaLa. Ew, my mouth is all dry. I'll get some water in a minute. I'm trying to become a vegitarian. Isn't there different kinds? I am not sure. So far the only meat I still eat is chicken. I have "Moshi Moshi" by Brand New stuck in my head. I have no idea what Moshi Moshi means.      Hmm...I should probably say a little about myself. Um...my name is Karissa, but i prefer Rissa or Kris. I'm 14. My favorite movies are Breakfast at Tiffanys, The Virgin Suicides, Fight Club, and Donnie Darko. The person I most admire is Audrey Hepburn. I am at the moment trying to not cuss as much. I'm working on loving myself. I'm currently in therapy for depression and cutting, but I've been doing really well and I'll be done soon. I'm kinda dorky, slightly paranoid, quiet, and I don't know what else. Hehe. I like punk, rock, emo, some indie, some pop/rock music. I also like stuff animals! My favorite animal is a kitty kat. Uh...hmm. That's all I can think of for now! Ta Ta ladies and gents!      you know you love me,   Spazz (my nickname)
