						   Hi all, It's me again. I can't believe that no one has put any SP stories here yet. Wasssup peoples? You certainly can't say you haven't dealt with any lately. If you can, I want to live where you live.   I do have a small comment:  I know that we can do some stupid things even though I consider us IP's. We are just smart enough to tell on ourselves and be the first one to laugh. So this has now happened a few times but I can't help but laugh every time I do it. Did you know when you are missing a limb, especially a lower leg, that it's not there any more? Apparently I don't have this concept. Apparently I think it is invisible or something and it will stop me from landing on my face.  Then yesterday; Haddy gave me a message that I needed to return a call. I swore she said it was Midnight. She (Haddy) told me that the caller left a message about getting some new furniture from our old pastor and his wife. I was so confused, when did she (Midnight) see them or talk to them. So I call Midnight and I start talking about how she did it again. We were thinking about calling each other at the same time.(I was going to call her at that time and tell her to watch a certain TV show but someone was online...)So I am just rambling on and she sounds strange. Finally she said, "I didn't call and leave you a message." "I have no idea what furniture you are talking about." My bad. How stupid do I feel?   Geezzz....Leave it to me. Thank goodness it was Midnight and not some stranger!  When Angel Spirit was here for a visit, she let me copy her Bill Engvall CD's. (the guy who does 'here's your sign') OMG he is so funny! When I listen to him it makes me think of all the stupid things that have come out of my mouth. I will confess eventually. But I am saving them for a rainy day.  May your day be exempt from SP!

						   *SCREAMS* I HAD to go byebye today and it was horrible!! Every fucking asshole who got their license out of a box of lucky charms is out. I almost puked and cried at the same time. They either couldn't find the gas pedal or the right lane to be in or how to merge onto the interstate. All they accomplished was to thoroughly push me to the brink of murder. Then there were more Semi's then I have seen in a long time. Pulling in front of people, going to slow. I swear them asswipes need their own lane! I NEED A ZANEX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! N O W!!!! *grabs her rifle and loads it*  >whispers

						   This was a great idea! *pats herself on the back*  So glad we can all get together and relieve our stress about SP. Tell their stories, share the frustration. I can't wait to read all about it.

						   Yo all youse peoples, how's it going? I hope  free from SP. I have remembered another commercial that I find insulting: Have you seen these 'drug ads'as in the 'marijuana' ones? This one is two adults yelling at each other through a door. Each one takes a turn as the adult and the kid. They are slamming the door very hard screaming, "It's just a little pot"(child) and "your grounded!"(Adult) then when they are done practicing the adults look at each other and say "Are you ready?" and the other says "Let's do it."  OK...I know that if my hubby and I are slamming doors and screaming at each other, my kids would come and see WTF was going on. Being a kid in that house, hearing what they were yelling, I'd be gone! Out the back door and trying to figure out where I am going to go.Stupid, stupid, stupid... that's all I have to say about that!  I was hoping that Midnight would join this blog. She could share with you her favorite Wendy's chicken strip commercial. I will let her tell it. I hope this finds you all well.  Buhbyes...

						   Hey All, where are you guys? No SP spotting? You can't mean there gone already? I know better! I saw one the other day! The asshole couldn't drive! What is it about SP and driving??  Once upon a time in a state far away lived this young girl. Her Father had owned a restaurant. She was walking to work one day, about 3/4 of a mile. All the way there people honked and waved. She felt beautiful! Like man, this is going to be a good day! She gets to work and her Dad is at the checkout station. One of her best friends, Wags, was already there for her shift. Also the usual 5 or 6 guys were sitting in the coffee shop, these are the regulars and friends of her Dad's. That area is just right next to the checkout. All of a sudden she hears this roar of laughter, her Dad being the loudest. Wags grabs her arm and starts to drag her to the back towards the office. By this time she heard thunderous laughter from the front and Wags was trying very hard not to laugh. She mumbles through the laughter "the whole back of your dress is tucked into the back of your nylons." She refused to work until all the people that saw her had left. Oh and her Dad wasn't going to force the issue! Moral: ALWAYS check your entire outfit in a mirror before leaving the house or else, wear your sign.

						   Go figure, Kismet had a SP encounter... I'm shocked! NOT! Have you guys been noticing how dumb the commercials are getting again?? I really believe that they are directed toward the SP. I mean, a wireless ad.,This guy walks into his bathroom and his wife's Aunt was in the tub. What does he do? He stands there and stares at her and then she waves and he waves back. OMG You tell me that an IP would have just stood there. There is no way! We would have got out of that bathroom faster than lightening!   Ok, here is just one of my many many of encounters with myself and stupidity. I have to tell this one because my loving hubby remembered it the other day and was quick to give me shit.       The setting: Springdale Ar.       The people: The 5 of us and my Mom.       The story:  My Mom thinks that it would be fun to head up north and spend the night. So she gets 2 rooms. 1 for me and hubby and the other for her and the kids. The rooms are on opposite sides of each other so I head to our room. The bathroom was screaming at me, I ran into my hubby on the way and he told me our room number and then told me their room number. I make it into the bathroom and low and behold there was a phone on the wall next to the toilet. So I pick it up and call the kid's room. The phone was answered and I begin to, in a sing song voice, say " Guess what I am doing? I'm going pp in the potty and talking on the phone at the same time" I then hear, "who is this?" I suddenly realize that they gave me the wrong room number and I promptly hang up. Well if that isn't bad enough, I go and stand on the balcony outside the room and look around to see if anyone is going to come and hall me away in a van or something. Here comes my husband and I quickly tell on myself. As he is laughing his ass off; I look out at all the cars. *now people, this next thing that escapes my mouth is true and I don't think I could have made it up...* "Wow, look at all the out of state plates in this parking lot" No shit! I said that, at a hotel....I thought Rain was going to pee all over himself. Ok, so you think I am done? Well, I'm not. Rain and I packed for a romantic night. I brought one of our favorite toys. Well, I took the batteries out and shoved bob to the top and put the batteries back in. Here we are, in our room, and I am trying to remove bob from the toy. My husband asks what the hell am I doing and I look him square in the eyes and say, "I'm trying to finger out my stuff from up here in my toy." I have no idea how he responded because I was laughing so hard. It was time for bed. I needed to start my day over. Now if this gets spread around, be kind and change the name to protect me from further embarrassment. Thank you...

						   HIGH-SPEED CHASE -- Officers arrested Jeffrey G. Giles, 25, of Orem, early Sunday after he assaulted members of his family in the area of 1000 West and 300 North and led officers on a high-speed pursuit up Provo Canyon. Officers were successful in getting the suspect stopped after spiking his tires, but not before he ran the truck he was driving into two Provo police vehicles. The suspect was booked into the Utah County Jail.   WHAT WAS HE THINKING!!!!!!  People like this are the worst stupid people because they are dangerous.

						   there is a big difference between having stupid moments and being a part of the stupid people group. Stupid moments are like the stories we have been telling. Stupid people are like what Bill Engvall talks about with 'here's your sign'. Stupid things we say. The one I have to watch to not come out of my mouth is when someone gets hurt. Like if someone falls and breaks a leg, I then will ask, "Are you alright"? HELLO?! What is up with that? Of course they're not alright. And I have noticed a lot lately on talk shows, the guest starts by telling their story: example:  Host: Why don't you tell us what happened. Guest: Well, I have been with this guy for 3 years and all of a sudden;one day he just up and leaves. Host: So how long were you together? Either there is no sound quality on that stage or someone is being stupid. I believe it is the later of the two.Well I will quit rattling on and on.  be free from SP

						   I think that tattle tales in the office should be included in the SP club.  They usually do not know what is going on and just jump to their own stupid conclusions.  And of course they have there noses so far up the bosses butt they have no air supply to their brain. *pretty pissed off*

						   that Blogger can move to the SP class. I have been fighting with it since about 3pm and it is 5 now. I have to remember it does that sometimes. There is no perfect program. There is no perfect puter. They are all stupid!!! I HATE stupid... hate it hate it hate it. That's all, done and over. I will be damned if I have to start this all over again.  Kismet: I think you should add comments to your blog. That way I can direct this to you. I hope your feeling a little better. But I have no idea what's going on.  Buhbyes

						   OK, last night I thought of something about stupidity. I said to myself, "self, you need to remember to blog this tomorrow." Do you think I can remember what it was that pushed my buttons? Oh hell no. My memory has deserted me. poof, gone. So that is my SP blog today. I'm not quite stupid just a bit dumb.

						   Can anybody tell me what is up with these drug makers? I mean lately it is really getting on my nerves. The commercials. They are "pushing", they're pushers! Why is it they want the people to go to their Dr. and ask if they can be put on this prescription drug? I have 8 scripts, medicade will only cover three but your Dr can get you up to 6 through medicade. Some of you know what I am talking about, maybe all of you do. I know that I HATE being on so much medicine. Let alone the cost of some of them. I am so sick of being treated like I'm stupid. Why do they medicate the symptoms instead of fixing the under lying problem? Why are they allowed to advertise that way? I mean, come on people, we are being taken to the cleaners here. They won't legalize Mary Jane but they push their drugs, the ones that kill your liver or stomach. They may cause any of a number of things, but it will fix this particular symptom and then the FDA says it may harm you. They're not sure. Then here comes the commercial with the Lawyer dude saying, Have you or anyone in your family, taken *insert drug name here* and experienced death or even a coma? Call me and we will get you in on this lawsuit against the companies. OMH!!!!!! (for non Utah residents, that's Oh my heck.)  I could go on and on but I won't. So far all of you have a higher IQ then I do,*giggles*. It feels great to find out that we IP's have found each other through the years!  Peace out...

						   I am not grounded anymore and I sure hope I learned my lesson! I think I need a spanking, oooooo that sounds nice. (JK)  Today,on the unknown web site for SP, has to have a request for SP's to get on line at the same time and make it real slow for any of us to communicate. They are trying to keep us away from each other because we are getting to close to finding them and picking them off one by one. Be strong ladies, we all know that SP had to build these things. No baseball bats to your monitor, No sledge hammer for your hard drive. We have an IP on the inside of this particular operation. Just push yourself away from the keyboard, grab some chocolate, and go put in a movie. This place sucks today! LOL  SP beware!

						    in my email today and screaming&nbsp; "Here's your sign!" :  This is for all you dog lovers:&nbsp; I pulled into a crowded parking lot and rolled down the car windows to make sure my Labrador Retriever had fresh air. She was stretched out on the back seat, and I wanted to impress upon her that she must remain there.I walked to the curb backward, pointing my finger at the car and saying emphatically,"Now you stay. Do you hear me? Stay! Stay!"The driver of a nearby car, perhaps noting that I'm a blonde,gave me a strange look and then said,"Why don't you just put it in park?"  dog lovers or blonde lovers?(huge grin of triumph!)

						   Woman Steals Sex Toy Leaves Evidence At SceneThursday, August 05, 2004WBAL Radio and The Associated Press  A sex shop in Decatur, Alabama, planned to file an arrest warrant for a woman who allegedly left the store without paying for a toy but who left a good lead on how to find her: She had just filled out a job application."I thought, that is a classic case of dumb-crook news," said Jamie Hudgins, a sales clerk at Pleasures. She said the 22-year-old Decatur woman entered the store with two friends at 12:30 p.m. Monday, completed a job application and browsed the store before leaving. The anti-theft alarm at the exit sounded as she left. She then pulled the $22.12 worth of merchandise from her purse, tossed it on the floor and fled, Hudgins said. Hudgins said an attachment for the sex toy remained in the woman's purse. Hudgins told The Decatur Daily in a story Wednesday that the woman's mother offered to pay for the items but the store would not be lenient. She said the store also plans to seek harassment charges against another woman who called the store in connection with the alleged shoplifting.

						   A wonderful Message by George Carlin:  The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but shorter tempers, wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints. We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness.  We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.  We've learned how to make a living, but not a life. We've added years to life not life to years. We've been ! all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not inner space. We've done larger things, but not better things.  We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait. We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.   These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships. These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete.   Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because the! y are not going to be around forever. Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side.  Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent.  Remember, to say, "I love you" to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you.  Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person will not be there again.  Give time to love, give time to speak, and give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind. AND ALWAYS REMEMBER: Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.  If you don't send this to at least 8 people.... who cares? George Carlin

						    In case you needed further proof that the human race is doomed through stupidity, here are some actual label instructions on consumer goods. On a Sears hairdryer -- "Do not use while sleeping." (Damn, and that's the only time I have to work on my hair). On a bag of Fritos --" You could be a winner!  No purchase necessary.  Details inside." (the shoplifter special)? On a bar of Dial soap -- "Directions: Use like regular soap."  (and that would be how???....) On some Swanson frozen dinners -- "Serving suggestion: Defrost." (but, it's "just" a suggestion). On Tesco's Tiramisu dessert (printed on bottom) -- "Do not turn upside down."  (well...duh, a bit late, huh)! On Marks & Spencer Bread Pudding -- "Product will be hot after heating." (...and you thought????...) On packaging for a Rowenta iron -- "Do not iron clothes on body." (but wouldn't this save me more time)? On Boot's Children Cough Medicine -- "Do not drive a car or operate machinery after taking this medication."  (We could do a lot to reduce the rate of construction accidents if we could just get those 5-year-olds with head-colds off those forklifts.) On Nytol Sleep Aid -- "Warning: May cause drowsiness."  (and...I'm taking this because???....) On most brands of Christmas lights -- "For indoor or outdoor use only." (as opposed to...what)? On a Japanese food processor -- "Not to be used for the other use."  (now, somebody out there, help me on this. I'm a bit curious) On Sainsbury's peanuts -- "Warning: contains nuts."(talk about a news flash) On an American Airlines packet of nuts -- "Instructions: Open packet, eat nuts."(Step 3: maybe, uh...fly Delta?) On a child's Superman costume -- "Wearing of this garment does not enable you to fly."  (I don't blame the company. I blame the parents for this one.) On a Swedish chainsaw -- "Do not attempt to stop chain with your hands or genitals."  (Oh my God..was there a lot of this happening somewhere?)
