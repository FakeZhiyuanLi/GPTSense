      It’s about 2 am, I sometimes stay up late, I can’t sleep like I used to. I keep thinking and stuff…too much thinking isn’t good for the brain. Well I went to my computer and started playing some songs….one of them being Grandpa “tell me bout the good ol’ days” by the Judds…yes the judds. I do like a handful of Country songs…and I think everyone has to like some country…you can’t just automatically hate every genre without some little inkling of appreciation. Anyway, I was listening to this song, and I thought of my grandpa, of the past, and I was filled with emotion and energy….when I am emotional, I can’t control my self sometimes. I was teary eyed, wondering if I had shamed my grandfather, my ancestors, if I hadn’t taken the right steps through life…how I was such a disappointment. I thought how happy I used to be as a little kid…or so I have been told…and how you lose that shit…why?? I don’t understand it! I hate this… I remember talking with my grandfather a few times, when I was young…he died in 1990. His name was Antonio Sanchez, I have his name as my middle name. I never really knew my other grandpa…he deserted my mom…sort of…I have been told that my family sort of ostracized him…at the time it wasn’t cool to have a birth out of wed-lock…my mom has said that she is a proud bastard. That pisses me off sometimes. Anyway, he would usually sit in his pajamas, drinking a can a beer. He would talk about the past sometimes, though he would usually just watch tv…I guess after so many years, you have this vision of people that isn’t quite what it used to be…but still, he loved us, and he was around, and he was this seemingly strong person…but then cancer came and then he died. It was the first time that I lost someone so close to me. And I was so angry at god….I was only 11 or something…but I was angry. I didn’t have an easy childhood, parents always worked, I was the loner at school, and we couldn’t really have too many friends in my neighborhood---due to gangs and such. But I believed in God, I went to church, I prayed hard, I became an altar boy…I did everything I could think of to insure that God loved me and would look out for me. I believed…. But there was my grandfather, in a coffin, pale, not moving. I had heard a week earlier that he had died at the hospital, and I still remember. We had come home from school, and my parents sat us down, and told me and my brothers about grandpa. I don’t think it sunk in at first. What does that mean? Dead? I guess it didn’t compute. But when I saw him at the funeral home, well it all came back and hit me like a freight truck. I was despondent, I had a number of asthma attacks in the next few days, and to top it all off, I served as an altar boy at his funeral mass. I tried to be strong, but it was too hard. I didn’t believe anymore. I know now that it’s part of life, but it took a long time to get that through my head. But still, I never fully recovered in a fashion, as I didn’t really believe in god anymore. What kind of god would do this? What kind of god would subject a person to this? At the time, I thought these things….that I had been good, that I had tried not to sin, not to hateful to those who were hateful towards me…blah, blah, blah. And yet, I was seemingly rewarded with the death of my grandfather. Now, I know better, that god doesn’t control these things…it’s just life. And I know that my grandfather is not disappointed with me…maybe not that much. Probably too busy watching the Duke on his heavenly tv set. But he does catch a glimpse of my ordeals from time to time…I bet he chuckles with his beer in his hand. Maybe.  for my grandfather...  I remember the life in the spring, in the light with the hopes and the songs that were sang.  I remember the life when the drinks and the food seemed unending, and the laughter went to the dawn.  I remember the life when time was not daunting. To be at one's prime, in the summer, before the twilight...  As the geometry of shadows nestle the fading candelight, the enfolding night embraces my memory.  But like a star's cry, I am vigilant, if apt to reflection, and I remember the life I once led.  p.s. T, sorry that my blogs on Myspace and here are the same now...it just seemed easier...maybe I should try to divide up my blog space...one topic here and one topic there....we shall see.

      Ok, so I was thinking about religion and stuff the other day. It happens. Religion and spirituality have always been fascinating, and frustrating, topics to me. Way back in High School, I began to read different holy books, the Zend-Avesta, the Tao te Ching, the Uspanishads, the Koran, the Ramayana, even a little Torah....and of course I read the entire Bible...I did go to Catholic school after all. But I always felt that Catholicism, and christianity in general, was a downright depressing religion, nothing worth celebrating, and nothing worth keeping. I went to confession once, and I told this old priest that I was having some doubts about my faith....and he yelled at me for five minutes about my wicked ways and such. but that didn't really destroy my faith, since some old luny man doesn't really make the end all and be all for me...no. My mom made us to go church every sunday, and I can't remember when, but I decided to look around at other people in the church. I do this from time to time, when I'm bored, and I start looking at other people, what they're doing, what are their facial expressions, and I wonder what they are thinking. Well, everyone in that church didn't look happy. They looked like they were going through the motions. Everything was scripted, and so it's easy to just have your refrain that you do every Sunday. I was screaming inside, "what's wrong with you people!" "Does being here really make you happy, with your empty rituals, refrains, songs, and dirges?" I knew what the answer was for me, and from that point forward, I vowed never to go to church again, unless it made my heart swell with joy and I was truly meant to be there....since that time, I have probably gone to church two or three times over the course of four years. This was usually due to baptisms and such. I have kept my vow, and I don't really see any end to it all. Now, I'm not really attacking anyone's religious beliefs, but I have been raised to question things. Why we do this and why we do that. I would hope that other people are doing the same thing...questioning at the very least. You don't have to have outright speculation, but at least be mindful of things and why you are the way you are. I guess if it gives comfort to people during times of crisis, then that's ok. But I have been through a lot of things in my life, and church/god has not given me any comfort. I guess that's kind of fucked up, but there you go. Faith is such a frustrating thing, putting your trust in some god, or in people for that matter. My faith is pretty low, though I know that I will always have hope. And I know in the back of my brain that what I have learned from 13 years of catholic school cannot be undone just like that. I still believe that Christ was some super-special being that was meant to help people. Was he god? maybe. Who knows?Still, religious belief is different then religion and its establishment. The Church, and sometimes its membership, has this view of controlling your actions and thoughts, which I find abhorrent. Christians, some of them anyway, can be the most judgemental people. They believe that they are these pious people who can do no wrong since they are in god's special graces. But I am sure that if you look deep enough, they have a bad track record somewhere, and they are just as dirty as the rest of us. The Church is this monstrosity that is old, decrepit, and callous to human suffering. It is an instrument of perversion of what Christ originally mandated. Of course, when I speak of the Church, I mean the big one in Rome, but I think all of the other denominations are simply derivatives of the original church. So, one doesn't believe in saints, or the other has women priests, or the other has some funky singing section....it's all the same basic structure, the same basic tenants, and the same fatal-flaws. Not that I am saying that Christians are not capable of good and beautiful things....look at the Cathedrals of Europe, the manuscripts of the middle ages, bingo. But with the good, comes the bad...the inquisition, religious strife between denominations in Ireland, and with other religions- like with Islam, the slaughter of tens of millions of people in the Americas---the church took part in that one, especially with the missions, the congregating of people- which spread diseases even faster, and the continued intolerance of people-especially women and homosexuals. If anyone reads this, and takes offense, I apologize for that. I'm just being honest and trying to work my thoughts in my head. But I do invite dialogue...if anyone wants to do so in a civil manner...I don't need the "you're going to burn in hell", or "the bible says this..." I know what the bible says thanks. I plan on writing a sequal blog to this, called "why I'm a pantheist," since I feel that I must explain my current belief structure, though it is also on shaky ground. later. E

      August 16th, 2004  Ok, so my computer just continues to exasperate me. I have a roommate- has this funky Imac, and it's fine. He can do practically anything on it. Download, games, music, you name it. But me and my labtop toshiba? I'm online right now, and I am probably getting like a thousand viruses. I can't explain it. It is frustrating the hell out of me. That's life though, very frustrating.  So, at first, I downloaded sophos online...and it worked ok, but it didn't really do anything- I mean apart from letting me know that there were viruses...very good alert system, but not really good at doing anything. So I decide to buy Norton Antivirus with Spam-blocker....Oh, and for some reason, Adware has taken complete control of my computer. In any case, it does it's scan, and is able to obliterate a number of viruses and other hang-ups...but it also seems to be more about alerting to viruses then to deleting them...I still have to go on safe mode and manually delete the buggers. It pisses me off.  What is perhaps more frustrating is that I am now blocked from downloading music from Kazaa and Morpheus. It's not like I download all the time or huge amounts of music files...I mean I still only have dial-up. But I still like the ability to do so, and for some reason, you can only get these features with ads-support---which conflicts directly with Norton's anti-spam rhetoric. So, the two are battling it out, and canceling each other out in the meantime. Again, mega-frustrating. I am not yet ready to give up, but I damn near ready to go insane.  But, I have options...but they all involve me spending some money---which it turns out I have little of these days...crazy I know. So, I am willing to live with my computer having some viruses. Fine. If it goes a little slower, then so be it. I rather it be free to do what I need to do then to be ultra-protected---like having seven condoms on---and it isn't helping make the mood right. How could you feel anything at that stage?  Onto to other topics of giving up---I think I have given up officially on this person I liked. I mean, more than liked at one point, and I still have dreams about them, and when I hear a stupid song, there is their shit-eating grin. But, I am trying to be realistic about things, about my chances, about this person...and the more I think about it, they are not all that they are cracked up to be. They have numerous and big-time flaws, and only stupidity has caused me not to see them before now. I mean, you give them a call, you say you want to talk one more time, and they seemingly agree to do so after they get back from some summer vacation. Of course, I agree that I should have had inquired further about when they were returning...but I didn't want to be all in their business---this was supposed to be a talk about moving on.  So now- three weeks or so have passed, and I am fairly certain that they must be back by now. And i'm not going to do a damn thing...first- I am tired of always be strong and of being the one with more guts...fuck that. Second, I am getting really busy with work, school, being the prez of my org, trying to better myself without regressing. Third, I am not as passionate about my feelings as I used to be. I'm not saying that I don't give a damn anymore, cuz I certainly do, but I'm not at such a point that my whole existence is centered around this person anymore. It is both a refreshing and terrifying feeling...but I hope that this will be past me soon.  note** I think I am regressing---since I am feeling slightly turned on by someone exactly like this last idiot...I got to stop being the perpetual idiot myself.  My dad's "disk slipped!" What does this mean? I have no idea, but I know it has to do with his back, that he is in a lot of pain, and that the status quo is continuing. I feel bad for my Dad, and my mom who has to deal with all this. But I am getting a little fed up with one problem after another. I don't understand why after all of these years, his body is just all of a sudden giving out on him. No warning, no signal that all is not well. Just one day- back goes out, stroke, cancer, surgery, hip has issues, headaches, neck problems, and now a disk slips! It would make any sane person go straight from sane to kookoo over insane.  To top it all off, it's his b-day weekend, which is just horrible. I feel bad, I feel angry, and I feel irritated. Not a good combination. There is nothing I can do to help...which makes things worse. I hope my mom can make it through this ok, but I am unsure. She is already depressed, losing a lot of weight, and on edge.  So, I have tried to look for this song called Ladykillers by Lush. Back in the mid-1990's, Lush was an up-and coming alternative act from England that had this big-hit. But then one of their peeps died somehow and they have never been heard since. Ladykillers was a cool song, but that doesn't mean I want to buy like their whole album...I did that with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and Maps is still their best song by far...nothing else on that album comes close. In any case, I try to download from my computer....which just so happens to be right in the middle of those issues I brought up earlier. So, I ask my roommate with the perfect computer to download this song and others for me....and he is able to download almost all of the songs I ask for in less then an hour....it would have taken me like three days or so. Except for the song I really wanted....Ladykillers. Is it so hard to find just one song?? It is terrible. I am still frustrated...and the frustation continues---there is no food in this place, and I have no money...but for some reason, I do have lots of gum...hmm.  E

      Hello,  Not that I think that anyone is reading or gives a crap, but this is Eric's blog space. I am not sure why I have such a space, originally, I just wanted to show some support for a friend and comment on her original blog....but then I did something stupid, like sign for blog space...but there you go.  Now I have my very own blog space. And what I am going to do with it? Will it be a beneficial place for mankind?? Can great ideas be expounded open here? Will I allow my creativity to flow out of every pour? NO.  I have decided that I will use this space to ramble, to whine, to bemoan, and to get out all of my stupidity on. I think it will be therapeutic, maybe even cathartic....but more than likely, it will probably be really dumb. But I guess I'll find out.  First subject...what is wrong with people? I mean, you'd think that as a person, like everyone else, you would have some understanding of other people's motivations, and desires, and outlooks. I mean, we can't all be so different?! But yeah that's not true. I just don't get everyone, and I'm pretty sure the feeling is mutual.  I don't think everyone is so damn complex, but we want to convey the appearance of complexity so that we don't look shallow, vain, whiny, and lacking the necessary brain tissue to function. in reality, we are exactly what we don't want to be...with all the negative attributes we despise in other people. We hate hypocrites, and yet we do some pretty contradictory stuff. We don't want to be alone, but yet we do everything in our power to drive people away. We hate liars, and yet, we will stretch the truth if it was in our best interest. That's who we are.  And that's what I don't get. People piss me off. You try and try to be a good friend, a good listener, and a "law abiding" member of society. And what does it get you....nothing. Not a "thanks" or a "glad to have known you" or a "Congratulations for not breaking any laws today certificate." For all the good/productive work that you do for others, you get nothing but higher expectations of your selflessness. People expect you to continue to perform the same way, to go above and beyond the call of duty, and to continue to care about their problems. Selfishness incarnate I tell you.  Maybe I am being a little hard on people. Maybe I expect too much from others. I need to set my expectations on a lower plane...since if you have such low expectations in the first place, it's kind of hard to be disappointed. But fuck that....Who the hell wants to live in a way where their expectations of life and others is frickin low? I want to be happy. I want to have fun, and learn new things and have new experiences. I want to experience crazy and wonderful things...and the only way that is going to happen is with other people.  Even though people are fundamentally annoying, they are the only game in town. I say annoying because of flipflop affect I was talking about earlier. One day, you are absolutely necessary for people's existence, while the next day, you are now yesterdays' news. One day your phone will be ringing off the hook, and the next, no one gives a fuck if you're dead or alive. See, now that's annoying. A little consideration is all that is required. A little word or two would change things in fundamental ways. And yet, I am always the one who has to make the first step, or has to change my methods to interact with people, who has to acquiese to their way of doing things. Bull shit....people need to do the same for me in that case.  Ok, I am feeling better. later
