        I hate my life!!!      I just want to die!     &nbsp;This might be my last entry because today, jo ann pushed me off the edge.     &nbsp;she sprayed water on me for no good reason and called me gay. then she accused me of stealing!     &nbsp;on top of that, she got support from my other classmates.      i just want to crawl into a hole and die!!!!     &nbsp;nobody loves me, not even likes me, i should just jump of a building.      my parents hate me.     &nbsp;my mother is always complaining about me to my father and my father keeps calling me shit, asshole or a fat piece of slug and such! then i have no friends in school.      everyone hates me!!      even in church, i am being leactured that noone likes me!!!!      Even i hate myself.      i thought that when i come to school i can forget about all my other problems but it dosent seem so.      there is nowhere left for me to go.     &nbsp;i think the only way is to end my life.      i dont know how long i can live like this anymore.     &nbsp;Why God?     &nbsp;Why?     WHy?     WHY????  &nbsp;

         Well, today we had CME first. ms decruz did not come so we had subs instead. The first sub was ok. He pretty much allowed us to do whatever&nbsp; we wanted stopping short of allowing us to play cards. The second sub was terrible!!!!! That stupid ms tan!!!! She was a fuckung basturd who went around lecturing us on how much she hated to talk. WHAT THE HELL!!!! she herself was talking!!!      if that wasn't enough, she made suresh carry her books for her just because he turned around to ask something, If I see her outside and I had a frying pan in my hand...I Would Wack Her On The Head With It!!!!        Then after that, we had science. that mrs chee, she always scoldes me even if its not my fault. WHY??? well, after recess, that old crackpot, mr allan, went around scolding us for not doing his work.       well, after that we had maths.Yippe!!! YA RIGHT!!! anyway, later i am going for cell group. gotta also buy aaron a present. BYEEE!!!!
