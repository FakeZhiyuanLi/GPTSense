      **Catch-up post  The following is part of a comment posted today:  "Ally.. why no blog? Bet you've been 'pigging out' and not dared tell us all about it."  Well, while I haven't been totally "pigging out" as he so tenderly puts it...I haven't exactly been the healthiest girl either...and he's right, I didn't want to say anything.  I guess by not saying something implies the truth anyway.  So - over the weekend, we went to Milwaukee to Summerfest.  We drove about five hours to see a band in concert that Jim and I love, the band  urlLink Live .  We left Saturday morning and came back Sunday afternoon.  We did have the best time.  We were standing on the very front row directly in front of the speakers.  The place was so packed that we stood for six hours straight.  By the time we walked back to the car, my back was killing me, and my ears didn't quit ringing for two days.  It was really great!  Seeing as how we were out of town, I decided I didn't want to eat right.  And I didn't.  And I gained five pounds in two days.  And I was desperately trying to hide the fact by not posting, but truly what good does that do me?  So...I'll start today by being honest.    Monday I weighed in - a gain of five pounds - 318.   B - Didn't eat.  L - Didn't eat.   D - Ate dinner at the Munchie Emporium (Shroom n' Swiss burger, fries, and a slice of carrot cake).    I got a migraine that night, the worst I've ever had.  I just laid on the bathroom floor after losing all my dinner thinking I deserved it for eating all that after being back home.  Tuesday - At about 5:45, my migraine still hadn't gone away, I was getting sick again, and it was time to go to the ER.  I've NEVER done that, but I've never hurt like that either.  They tried to give me an IV but couldn't find my veins so I just got a couple of shots - Toradol for the pain and Phenergan for the nausea.  I finally had some relief at 7 that morning.  Jim was hungry so he stopped at McDonald's for breakfast on the way home.  B - Sausage biscuit and hashbrown.  L - Nothing  D - Roast beef sandwich from Arby's and a small strawberry shake.  Wednesday - We have no food in the house so I ran to Wal-Mart for some groceries - and got lunch and dinner from the deli.    B - Nothing.  L - Two pizza sticks.  D - Three chicken strips and 4 potato wedges.  So...finally, after five days of eating completely how I please, how do I feel?    Miserable.  I'm back to posting, and I'll do better...so why do I still feel like a loser?

      Tomorrow is trash day in our neighborhood.  I went to the closet to get something to wear and looked at all the bags of clothes on the floor in the closet.  Those bags contained all of my favorite clothes, from size 16 through size 26.  Things that I can no longer wear.  Things that if I could wear would be hideously out of style.    So...why not get rid of them?  Jim wanted to look through them with me because he had some that he liked and wanted me to save them.  I did pretty good and got rid of 3/4 of them.  As I was taking them to the trash, I started trying them on.  What would possess me to do that?  The dresses I could maneuver into.  The little tanks squeezed the life out of me.  The jeans...well, let's just say that was really ugly.  It did nothing but remind me that I once could fit into those clothes (About three years ago, I was 340 pounds, lost 126 and got down to 214 pounds and gained most of that back - which is another long story).  It really depressed me to think I had let myself go...again.  What'd I do next?    Well, of course something destructive - I went and laid down naked on the bed and cursed myself and felt sorry for myself.  Jim, noticing that it got really quiet, came to the bedroom.  "You're laying there feeling sorry for yourself, thinking bad thoughts about yourself, aren't you?"  Well duh - of course I am.  I'm really good at self-loathing.  So he says, "Get up, don't let yourself do that...yes, you gained weight and now you're fixing it.  Go blog and get it all out."  So here I am...blogging...getting it out.  I let myself go - and I'm heading back to where I should be.  And when I get there, I'll buy new clothes instead of throwing on outdated ones.

      I think we all have our comfort foods...I have far too many comfort foods.  You'll probably think it gross, but one of my favorite meals growing up as a kid was creamed tuna.  My mom would put a can of tuna in the bottom of a pan with a little bit of butter, add some flour, and then milk and make this creamy concoction with tuna (essentially a bechemel sauce with tuna) and then serve it over rice (don't forget, mom is Japanese and we ate everything either with or over rice...creamed tuna, chili, goulash).  I loved it.  I was kind of craving that today so I made something close to it.  I put some broccoli florets in a pan with a little water and cooked it, added mushrooms, a can of tuna, and then when it was all bubbly, I added 4 tbs cream (this works great for a carb-conscious lifestyle and has only 45 calories for 2 tbs).  It was surprisingly good and even though I missed the rice, it was still satisfying.  B - Nothing  L - 1 cup broccoli, 1 cup mushrooms, 1 can tuna, 4 tbs cream  S - One mini keto peanut butter bar  D - 1 small yellow squash, 1/4 cup onion sauteed in 1/2 tbs of extra-virgin olive oil, and one 5 oz swordfish steak.  S - microwaved pork skins   **again, I know this sounds gross but because they're microwaved and not fried, they have TONS less fat and 0 carbs...a realistic substitution for chip cravings.  This is an interesting link (http://www.dreamwill.net/ljimages.php)  It shows the last 30 pictures that have been posted on public journals at livejournal.com.  It changes constantly, and it's interesting to see what other people post.

      I have been told water, water, water...if you want to lose weight, drink at least 8 glasses of water a day.    I guess I have my own plan...liquid is liquid as long as it doesn't have calories, although I think sodium plays into it as well.    I despise tap water.  It tastes like dirt to me.  If I had to drink it, I wouldn't.  So, I refill my water jugs at Wal-Mart for 33 cents and drink about a half-gallon a day...straight out of the jug (lady like, I know).    Even though I like distilled water, I even tire of that.  When I do, I'll drink Wyler's sugar-free kool-aid or diet soda.  I keep those on hand for when I can't seem to drink water.  I love soda, but I really have tried to lay off it because of all the sodium.  But when I need a fix, I'll put a two-liter in the fridge and drink that in a day.  I also like the sugar-free kool-aid but again...I try not to drink too much of that either because while it has a negligible amount of calories, I don't usually drink it by the glass...I drink it by the pitcher and those negligible calories would add up...and I hate drinking calories, lol.

      It's like dominoes...I needed to clean the spare bedroom (my mom is coming for an extended visit in August), but before I can do that, I have to clean the inventory room, and before I do that, I had to re-do the living room.  Jim, in addition to working outside of the house, started his own business several years ago selling books and videos.  When we moved in our house a year ago, we were excited because we now had a room to put all his inventory (Four days ago, it was so full you couldn't walk in there).  Unfortunately, his inventory has migrated all over the house...including the spare bedroom closet which houses his thousands of comic books.  My mother WILL have a place to put her clothes when she comes! lol  I rearranged, scraped, puttied, sanded, and painted our living room about a week ago.  Last week and this week so far has been nothing but going through Jim's old inventory.  This is SO TEDIOUS!  But has to be done.  I've thrown away so much...and I can see the room now...and last night, I lugged all those comic book boxes and put them neatly in the inventory room.  The boxes weigh at least 45 pounds, and he had over eight of them.  That was my workout for the day (not that I do one everyday).  I had to take Jim to work yesterday and stopped by King Gyros for lunch.  I love gyros.  I know a regular gyro is about 468 calories...but surely a chicken one would be less...I'm hoping.      I went to pick up Jim from work at 9:30 that evening, and we were both starving (don't forget, I've been lugging boxes).  We stopped at King Gyros...again...I had eaten lunch at 1:00 and hadn't stopped to eat anything else all day so by 9:30, I truly was pretty hungry.  B - Nothing  L - Small french fry, chicken gyro (pita, chicken meat), 1 oz of feta.  D - Nothing  S - Chicken gyro, one baklava  I put the gyro as being about 450 calories...that said, my total calories for the day was about 1650 (WW points 33, one more than I should have).  Anyone see a trend?  I had a good weigh in, and for the past two days, my eating has climbed.  Wednesday I will be back in control.  Otherwise, I will spiral till I put back on those 9 pounds...and then some.

      **Catch-up Post**  Today (06/21/2004)was the big day...I stepped on the scale.  I'm notorious for being a "Scale Watcher."  I swore this time I wouldn't do that...for a couple reasons.    1 - I'm obsessive about it getting on several times a day.  2 - What the scale says affects how I eat...If I weigh less, I think I have leeway to eat a little more...and if I weigh more, I think what's the point of eating less and not losing...and will eat more.  So, Monday morning, did the weigh-in ritual.  I wait until about 11:00 or so...give my body a chance to loosen up (I think I weigh more first thing in the morning because my body is so tight).  I take a shower to wash off all the extra dirt.  I dry my hair to get rid of the excess water (that must weigh more, right? lol).  And finally...naked, clean, dry I can stand on the scale.  It was a good weigh-in.  I was down from 322 to 313...9 pounds.  I was pleased with that.  Unfortunately, I know I can't keep that up...and there's the rub.  I know it won't happen every time and it disappoints me because if I could, then I would get to my goal that much faster.  That's not realistic though.  And with all the left-overs in the house, how did I eat?...knowing that I lost all that weight?...Bad...very, very bad.  B - Nothing  L - 4 ounces pulled pork, and a cup of potato salad.  *Did you know that 1 cup of potato salad has about 400 calories?  D - 15 melba rounds, 1/2 ounce goat cheese, 2 tbs. cajun krab dip, 1 oz braunschweiger, 3/4 cup potato salad.  It doesn't really seem like a lot...didn't seem like a lot when I was eating it either.  Well added up, that was 1500 calories (30 WW points...my max points for the day would be 32).  I love potato salad...and I threw the rest of it away.

      **Catch-up post**  To all you dad's out there, Happy Father's Day.    We did what we always do for Father's Day...go over to Jim's Mom and Dad's, have a meal, open gifts, and head home.  Henry and Katie (Jim's brother and Henry's ex-girlfriend...see previous post of 06/17 for that story) were also there.    I think family get-togethers have been one of the many endings to what was usually a good beginning of eating better.  I was dreading Father's Day for that reason...because I knew that I had to weigh in the next day, and I was going to be really ticked off if I didn't lose weight.    The sit and stare...if it wasn't for me and Katie, that's what it would be.  This family that I married into is so weird that way.  We never eat at the table, because it makes mom uncomfortable.  So we all sit in the living room.  And eat.  And no one says anything.  Katie and I look at each other and start talking.  They join in occasionally, but we keep up a steady conversation for two hours.  If we didn't, I swear no one would (Been there, done that!).  Henry (who is about 45 and 19 years older than Jim) is the worst.  He never says anything.  I want to pull my hair out so bad when we're all together.  It bugs Jim too, but he'll usually tell me...I don't really have anything to say to them.  He LOVES my family...they are polar opposites from his.  B - Nothing  L - 1/2 cup pulled pork, 1/2 cup potato salad, 2 meatballs, 2 slices cheese, couple fresh broccoli spears, and a brownie.  *Dad makes killer brownies...they are frosted, soft, and moist.  Mom can't cook, lol.  Unfortunately, they sent home five with us.  S - I got in the car and ate a brownie on the way home.    D - 1 cup pulled pork, 1 cup potato salad...and ANOTHER brownie.  It was at that point that I took the final three, gave them to Jim and said eat them or they're going into the trash now.  If he hadn't have eaten them, I don't know what I would've done.  I KNOW I would've been tempted to get them out of the trash, lol.  ...and my potato salad...it really isn't any better than the brownie and probably worse.  There is no telling what the scale is going to say after today.  I should've had some dieter's tea...but I thought about it only after I got in bed and was too lazy to get up and get it.   PS - Jim doesn't have the slightest weight problem at all.  He is 5'7 and weighs 132 pounds.  I know what you're thinking...She must crush him when they have sex!  I worry about the same thing, and I never get on top :>

      **A catch-up post - written a few days later**  Well, I was incredibly thankful to have one night with my son before he left for the rest of the summer.  I guess I'm pretty greatful for football though, because at least Alex has to be back at the end of July and won't stay gone through August.  Any time we take Alex down, there is always this mad rush at the last minute.  This time wasn't any different.  I had Jim (my honey) run to McDonald's to get lunch so we could eat on the way down.  I gave him the list of food, and he said, "Where's yours?"  I laughed.  I told him I'd eat something else...that today, I wasn't feeling the strength to have a little...that I'd want the full blown Big Mac deal.  There are some days where I feel I can be strong...but when I'm dealing with not seeing Alex for almost six weeks, that isn't going to be one of them.  He got off to his dad's just fine although I actually didn't see his dad that day...my ex-mother-in-law.  She has...had always loved me.  Said I was the best "daughter" a mom could have.  It's funny how things changed, even though I had good reason to leave(which is a WHOLE other story).    B - Nothing   *Note: I did, however, manage to avoid Krispy Kremes.  If you've ever had them, you know what a feat this was, lol.  L - Two skinless chicken thighs, 1 ounce cheese, 1 Wasa light rye.  S - One beef stick  *Note: We always stop at the gas station (it's a halfway point between his dad and me)...I avoided the jumbo hot dog and chips :)  D - A grilled chicken sandwich with no mayo from Steak N' Shake.  This made for about 975 calories (and 19.5 Weight Watcher's points).  Well below my projected points range.  Father's Day is going to be bad...I know this ahead of time.

      Is that even possible for someone of my size?  Who loves to eat the way I do?  It was yesterday, I guess.  I dropped my husband off at work and since I had spent so much time working with his inventory that week, I had neglected my cleaning.  I was going to pick my son up from camp that evening, and I had a massive amount of work to get done (which I did).    The "challenge of the day" was going to come later though after I picked up Alex (of course not his real name) from camp.  We always stop by The Creamery for a treat.  Since I had hardly eaten for the day and it was 6:30 at night, I was hungry.  We pulled up to the drive-thru and I wanted coney dogs, french fries, and real ice cream (I don't really care for soft-serve).  Well, I was a good girl :( - lol.  B - Nothing  L - Two skinless chicken drumsticks, 1 cup cabbage, 1 Wasa rye cracker, and 1 oz cheese  S - One small fat-free frozen yogurt  D - Two skinless chicken drumsticks  S - 5 melba rounds, 2 tbs cajun krab dip, 1 oz cheese  I came in today at a whopping 750 calories.  Just goes to show that I eat emotionally and out of boredom (mostly when I'm bored).  As for the yogurt, even though I really love hand-dipped ice cream, that fat-free frozen yogurt was really pretty good.  I'm not sure if it's because I haven't had anything like that in...six days...or if it actually was really good.  Last night in bed I was thinking about exercise.  I hate to exercise.  I think anyone who weighs as much as I do hates exercise, mostly because it's just so difficult to move around that much poundage.  A lot of times when I've tried to diet, I would absolutely exercise.  I wonder if maybe that was actually part of my failure (when I didn't exercise as 'scheduled', I blew it for the day and ate what I wanted).  I decided last night that the best thing for me was going to be just learning how to eat healthy, in normal proportions, and be happy about it.  I think once I've lost several poundages, it'll be easier to exercise then.  We'll see -

      Yes, I went to my in-laws, and yes, I ate the pizza.  Do you know how awkard it would have been to say "no thank you" while everyone else sat there and ate.  They always buy the Pizza Hut fours pizza...you know, the one where you can choose four different pizzas in one box, and then they cut each of the little pizzas into fours.  Well, I ate two pieces (two teenie weenie little squares)...one green olive (my favorite pizza) and one taco pizza without the chips.  It was soo good.     It was late enough when I left there that I went to my honey's work, and we ran to Wal-Mart for a few things.  I was pretty darn hungry at that point, and it was difficult to not buy "convenience foods" because I was so hungry...but I didn't.   Well, my food diary for the day is below.  On a whole, I don't think it was such a horrible day and certainly not as horrible as it could have been.  I came home and snacked on a few things but stayed under 1100 calories for the day.   B - 8 oz orange juice   L - One can tuna, 1/2 tbs mayonnaise, one Wasa light rye cracker, 1 cup shredded cabbage, 2 tbs Italian dressing   S - 2 skinless chicken drumsticks   D - Two squares of pizza (green olive and taco)   S - 1 oz goat cheese, 5 melba rounds, 1 Wasa light rye cracker, 2 tbs Cajun Krab Dip (it's really good and only 90 calories)   On another note - I don't know about your town, but in ours - we have really weird, skanky people that go to Wal-Mart late at night.  One girl from behind looked exactly like Paris Hilton, the blonde pony tail, short white ruffle skirt, midriff baring top...Skanky.     Or maybe just sour apples...  :>

      Tonight I'm supposed to go and visit my in-laws (my husband works 2nd shift so I'll go alone).  They regularly have dinner with my brother-in-law's ex-girlfriend.  The whole situation is kinda weird (he has dated her twice in the past, the first time he stopped because he decided he was gay...they actually started dating much later, got engaged, and at the last minute decided that it wasn't fair to her because he still has "feelings" for guys).  She is super sweet, and his family decided they weren't going to lose her because he can't seem to make up his mind.    So the dilemma, whenever we go there, we always have some kind of take-out because she doesn't cook (that is an entirely weird story itself).  I just got off the phone with her, and we're having pizza.  Should I eat?  In the too-numerous-to-count past 'diets', every time I eat something I shouldn't, it starts the thinking of, "I've blown it today, I may as well have fun."  I think this is a common mentality among dieters - thus, instead of calling it a diet, it's more PC to say - a healthy way of life, LOL.  I always laugh at this.  It's a freaking diet for me...abstaining from certain foods and the amounts I want of it is a diet.  Will I eat pizza?  That is the question...  We'll see ---- :)

      So I create a journal to help me get started and stay on track.  The next day, I go to log in and my blog isn't on my dashboard.  I e-mail for help and three days later, the problem is solved.  I accidentally created two accounts - profile was on one, blogspot was on another.  Well, regardless, it has been figured out.  Today I'll just write quickly my meals for the last three days just to get caught up (I actually kept track of them elsewhere).    Tuesday B - 8 oz orange juice L - 2 oz sirloin pork, 1 oz cheese, 0.5 oz rice crackers, corn on cob D - 5 oz lean steak, 1 cup brussels sprouts S - 1.25 oz Rudolph's bacon snacks (pork rinds you microwave...how gross does that sound?  They actually aren't bad and when you love chips as much as I do, they are a great low-carb substitute!)  Wednesday B - 8 oz orange juice L - 1 can tuna, 1 tbs mayonnaise, 1 Wasa light rye cracker, 1 cup shredded cabbage with vinegar and Splenda D - Two skinless chicken drumsticks, 1 small yellow squash S - 1.25 oz Rudolph's bacon, 1 oz cheese, 5 melba rounds  I did my duty, I wrote it down...  I'm not quite starving to death yet, lol. I suppose I could go without food for months with what I weigh now...

      It's finally that time - when you know you can wait no longer.  I am 34 (too soon to be 35), and I have tomorrow'd my life up until now away.  I've got at least half my life left, and I've pretty much done all the self-pity and hating of myself that even I can handle.  So - since I can be honest with no one but myself regarding what I eat and how I got to where I am, why not let the pressure (and maybe even accountability) of people reading this (while maintaining a certain amount of anonymity) help me out.    Who am I?    I am the oldest girl in my family.  My mother, a quiet, non-confrontational, half-Japanese woman is one of my best friends.  She loves me unconditionally and that is so great.  My dad is a retired career Army sergeant.  While we were growing up, he -was- authoritarian, controlling, strong, verbally abusive, and had a penchant for thinking his two daughters were there for his sexual pleasure and excitement.  He has since found God and moved on with his life, finding a new wife, new town, new church, even a new name...all the while leaving behind him a trail of messed up people.    My sister, darling girl that she is, has her own eating issues - she just chose to go the opposite direction.  She is very thin and can be wickedly mean if crossed.  We are the best of friends, but even though I am the older one, my little sister rules the roost.  She doesn't like to talk about personal things, and if she hurts your feelings and you cry, well, then you're just over-sensitive.  I ought to know - I'm a very over-sensitive person, so I've been told, lol.  My little brother, who is a good five inches taller than me, has committment and sex issues.  He is married to his third wife, just had his third child (each by a different wife).  I just hope to goodness he stays married this time.  For one, she's a really nice girl (although I don't think I'd like to cross her either), and two...who can afford THAT much child support.    Finally, there's me.  I am the oldest.  The responsible one.  The control freak.  Chaos makes me crazy.  It's not uncommon for me to get an idea in my head and to obsess about it until I've done it.  I have a hard time doing things halfway.  (Kind of makes you wonder why in the world I fail so terribly at dieting.) When I buy a book I want to read, I have to finish it all in one sitting (this has accounted for missed days at work and nights spent lying awake until 3 or 4 in the morning).  And of course, this wouldn't be "How Far Can A Fat Girl Go" if I didn't have an obsession with food.  Food is my comfort.  Unfortunately, food in a lot of ways is my life.  When I'm upset, happy, angry, sad, or celebrating, you know it's best done with food.  I love to cook, and I love to eat.  My mother once told me that even as a little girl, I would sneak food and then lie about it.  I'm 34 now and have to admit to still doing that.  It's embarassing to be fat and eat in public.    But - can I change that?  Goodness knows I hope so.  I have a husband and a son who I want to be there for and not just in presence.  I refuse to go to an amusement park or ride an airplane because I know I wouldn't fit in the seat.  I get really grouchy if I have to go somewhere (like a summer event) because I know people are staring at me.  So here goes -  I'm 34 My height is 5 feet 8 inches My weight is ... why is this so difficult when no one will even know who I am?...My weight is 322 pounds. I wear a size 3X.  Daily I will post what I eat, what kind of exercise (if any) I've done, and my thoughts about how I'm feeling or something (no matter how boring) that occurs to me.  Weekly I'll post my weight.  And if the humiliation of failing in front of an internet audience can't motivate me, then I'm just as pathetic as I thought I was, lol.  Let's hope that's not true...I'll be positive - I can do this.  Feel free to respond, offer suggestions, ask questions, and for those of you who are just really amazingly hard-hearted and want to write things that are not constructive or just plain mean, do me (and yourself) a favor and just move along to the next blog.  I'm sure there's some beautiful thin blonde out there who's ready to hear how great she is.  Food Diary:  B - A mini Keto chocolate peanut butter bar  L - A whole zucchini, 4 oz skinless chicken thigh, 1 oz mozzarella  D - McDonald's grilled chicken cobb salad, balsamic vinagrette dressing (including the croutons)  Exercise:  Treadmill for 10 mins (I think we can all agree that my heart is a little out of shape)  Well, that's it for today.

      Pretty much a boring day.&nbsp; Nothing but working, a little exercise, and tv. However,I came up with a few ways to amuse myself:   I shaved my dog. I was working at the computer when I looked over at my dog and decided she needed a shave.  Reecy is a red merle australian shepherd. It's been so hot lately that I thought she'd be cooler - so I shaved her - and left her with only 1/8 of an inch of hair. I was the one covered in hair by the time I was done but was entertained by the fact that she looked completely humiliated.   I purchased a guitar. I ordered&nbsp;it off the internet, and I can hardly wait for it to get here. When in high school and college, I played the piano and clarinet and I miss putzing around with music. I've always wanted to learn to play the guitar so I guess I'll teach myself.  I gave serious thought to bypass surgery. I am just so completely amazed at how many people have that surgery...especially after I read the complications. Is it the easy way out? For me, I think it would be.  When people get to the point where I am at and ones weight endangers health, what makes us keep on with the bad habits that got us here in the first place?  Unfortunately, the procedure fixes part of the problem but it doesn't fix the mind that put you there.  Also, you lose such masses amount of weight so very quickly that excess skin just hangs off of you - and that's not attractive - and you find yourself in another position where in order to get rid of that, you have more surgery. I am not dogging medical advances, but I'm wondering if it has allowed people to reach a goal without the "rewarding" work that produces not just physical but emotional, spiritual, and mental growth as well.   I've been exercising a little more. I think it's probably a good idea. I'm concerned that it will burn me out - because I really don't care for exercising (hate would even be appropriate) - but I really need to build up my heart health.   Foods: Lemon Luna Bar  1/2 cp low-fat cottage cheese  bacon snaps  1 oz almonds  cucumber  1 cp mushrooms  1 can tuna  6 melba toasts  Keto mini PB bar  grapefruit   Total cals 1173.  Did the exercise routine, took my vitamins, and because it was so hot, ended up drinking 80 ounces of water.

          It's been a while...weeks actually.&nbsp; I haven't been doing the greatest, but I haven't gained any weight either.&nbsp; I've been writing my food down in a "snail" journal so I think that's pretty much what has saved me from really going overboard and putting back on all the weight.&nbsp; I had gotten into the habit of eating pretty much nothing but frozen foods, still staying under, but I think the fat and sodium and lack of real "nutrients" was causing me to not lose any weight.&nbsp; So - back to eating more natural foods.&nbsp;   Food for Tuesday:  Apple 1 oz almonds cucumber mushrooms asparagus Keto mini peanut butter bar Can of tuna Six low-carb melba toast grapefruit bacon snaps  A total of 953 calories.&nbsp; Not bad.&nbsp; I even did an exercise routine and played a set of tennis (6 games).&nbsp;

      It's hard to believe that I have hit the top and everything after this is all downhill.  I hate getting older.  I truly do, and it didn't help matters that I had to weigh in today.  I was 316 pounds...two down from last week, up three from two weeks ago.  Pathetic.  I did, however, get my birthday wish.  I didn't want to do anything.  Jim woke me up at 9:00 to say happy birthday.  He brought me breakfast in bed and my gift.  He asked me what I wanted to do today, and I told him..."I don't want to get out of bed today unless I have to go to the bathroom.  I don't want to take the dog out.  I don't want to do dishes or cook or work.  I just want to lay here and watch t.v."  And that is exactly what I did.  The Animal Planet network ran their reality show, King of the Jungle.  I don't think I missed one minute of it.  I laid on my side, my back, my belly, at the foot of the bed, the head of the bed.  It was luxurious...even though I did get restless from time to time, lol.  I cannot remember the last time I did something like that.  B - A cup of Edy's Dreamery Butter Pecan ice cream, :).  L - A turkey and swiss sandwich and pringles.  D - Turkey and stuffing frozen dinner.  S - Another cup of butter pecan ice cream.

      *Catch-up post  I had a surprise visit from Alex on Saturday evening.  He came up from his dad's with his friend Robert.  They are all going to King's Island in Cincinnati for the next three days, and they both stayed the night with us before going back to Robert's dad's.  It was wonderful to have him here.  Sunday morning, he came in to say good morning (at 6:50) and asked if there was anything for breakfast.  I happily got up to scrounge around to only find milk that had gone bad and carb control yogurt.  I ended up taking Alex and Robert out to breakfast to the Big Boy, and they left a few hours later.  Jim had a tennis match to play (he's in the Parks and Rec league).  He won and had tons of energy left so he and I actually played too.  Unfortunately I forgot to bring my water with us, it was close to 80 degrees, and I was getting a little shaky and we had to stop...but I did play for 50 minutes and that was good.  We usually go to the fireworks downtown, but we decided not to do that this year.  I love fireworks but I hate crowds, and we have people come from all over (including from Ohio and Michigan) to watch our city's display.  We spent a quiet evening at home.  Well, sort of.  One of our neighbors must have used their last paycheck or two for fireworks, and we listened to them until almost midnight.    Tomorrow is my birthday.  I hate that I'm another year older and as fat as ever.  I don't know what I'll do if next year I haven't lost a significant amount of weight.  Somebody may as well just take me out back and shoot me.  B - Grits, three sausage links.  L - Weight Watcher's enchilada frozen meal.  D - Bacon snaps.

      I love nothing more than waking slowly on a Saturday.  This only happens when Alex is with his dad because if he's home, he is up before 7:00 and likes to come in to say good morning...whether we're awake or not.    We left the house at 9:30 to go play tennis.  It was fun although my stamina is low enough that I didn't get to play as long as I wanted.  As I've said before, I've been putting off "exercising" until I get to a weight where moving quickly is somewhat bearable, and Jim has been so busy at work that it's hard to find time to work tennis in.  I think we played a whopping 30 minutes this morning, and I felt pretty discouraged about it.  Jim was sweet enough to let me know though that even though it was a short period of time, I played really hard (noted by both good shots and the intensity of wheezing coming from my side of the court).  I'm anxiously awaiting the time when we aren't limited by my poundage.  A year or so ago, I had gotten to where I could comfortably play 1 1/2 to two hours at a time.  Maybe if I had eaten breakfast, my energy level would have been better...yeah, that's it.   Dinner this evening was a pre-birthday celebration.  I didn't know what we would be having so I more or less tried to conserve my calories for whatever that might be.  Jim's mom warned me she had plans to cook, but I may get pizza if she didn't feel up to it.  As you know, Jim's mom doesn't really cook, but she (with a lot of help from dad) actually did tonight.  We also sat at the dinner table (which we've done exactly two other times in the last almost four years).  Mom did really well for about five minutes into dinner but had an "attack" and had to excuse herself.  She says chicken gets stuck in her throat, but only when it's hot.  I truly don't understand what the difference is between cold and hot chicken (and it seems to me hot would be less dry).  There is nothing physically wrong with her.  She's just weird that way, as Jim says - not me :).  Dad says it's her nerves.  I say it's her head.  Ah well, she made the effort so kudos to her for that.  B - Nothing.  L - Skinless roast chicken breast and thigh, broccoli.  S - Bacon snaps.  D - One skinless chicken tender, 1/2 cup green bean casserole, 1/4 cup scalloped potatoes, 2 green olives, 2 black olives, 1/2 cup brussels sprouts.  S - 1/2 piece of birthday (commercial) cake, 1/4 cup sugar-free ice cream.

      Being Friday, I felt like sliding into the weekend by taking it easy today.  I worked at my computer, got Jim's orders ready, took apart a Weider exercise machine, and watched Wimbledon.  I love tennis...playing and watching.  It's a sport that for me is so much fun to play, I don't even bother thinking about the exercise I'm getting - I'm just out there having fun.    Saturday is the women's final at Wimbledon.  I was really hoping that Lindsay Davenport would make it to the final.  It looks like she'll be retiring soon, and she's always been a favorite of mine.  However, I suppose many will be looking forward to the gratuitous cam shots looking down Sharapova's dress as she waits for service come Saturday in addition to Serena's bare ass (the little bloomers under her dress have a tendency to ride up the rear...pretty deeply too).  It'll be interesting to see if the Russian glamour girl has what it takes to challenge Serena Williams.    As for food today, it was okay.  I'm sweating the weigh-in Monday so I'm hoping to be very careful over the weekend...but that's really going to be difficult considering we're going over to the in-laws for my birthday (before the birth day).  B - 1/2 cup cottage cheese, 1/2 cup blueberries, 2 tbs half and half.  L - Skinless chicken breast, 1/2 avocado.  S - Two Snackwell's creme sandwich cookies.  D - Skinless thigh and leg, 1/2 avocado, 1/2 cup cooked yellow squash.  S - Bacon snaps.

      It was a decent food day today.  It was the first time I haven't eaten out at some kind of restaurant in six days.  As stated earlier, I put a halt to that for the time being.  Because I've been so horrid lately, I decided to cut carbs as much as possible and keep it to strictly protein and fresh fruits and vegetables.  I also worked my ass off today.  I rearranged rooms, moved boxes and furniture, hauled trash, and just generally didn't sit down too much (other than to catch up on the Wimbledon matches).  I really felt the need to stay busy so I wouldn't obsess over food and the exercise was just an added bonus.  I kept the air conditioner off and with it being 90 in the house, I think I lost at least a half-gallon of water.  B - One raspberry carb control yogurt, 3/4 cup blueberries, 3 tbs. half and half.  L - One boneless, skinless chicken breast, 1 cup mushrooms.  D - Skinless chicken thigh and leg, 1/2 cup strawberries, 2 tbs. half and half.  S - Microwave bacon snacks.  As a side note, fresh berries have a tendency to go bad really quickly...especially smaller ones like blueberries and raspberries.  When I get them, I wash them right away, drain them, and put them back in the container I purchased it in and into the freezer.  They keep a lot longer and when you pour a small amount of half and half or cream over frozen berries, it freezes right to the berry and it's a very tasty dessert, :).

      Dining out has now become taboo for me.  I've decided, for a while anyway, that avoidance of restaurants will have to be my reality.  It is in dining out that one of my many warped ways of thinking rears its ugly head.  Seriously, why go out and spend money on a salad when I can stay at home and make that exact same salad...not to mention doing so for a lot less money?  I guess I've always viewed eating out as a "treat".  Growing up, going to restaurants was not something we did regularly.  We really only went out on Sunday's after church and always to Long John Silvers.  Well, since Alex has been gone for the summer to his dad's, we've been going out more.  It's simpler to go to Arby's for dinner on the way home from work or grab a sausage biscuit and hashbrown on our way out.  Unfortunately, a grab on the run meal is usually fast food and entails ordering off the "value menu".    The value clearly is only in the realm of dollars you spend because there's pretty much nothing of value for people watching what they eat.  It's convenient, it's cheap, and it's ridiculously full of calories, carbs, and those "evil" fats.  I have the hardest time going through a drive-thru and saying, "I'll have the small salad with an apple dipper, please."  Don't get me wrong, I like salads and I love the little apple dippers, but when I pull up to that menu and see all the choices, salad is at the bottom of that list.    Maybe someday I'll be able to go and be satisfied with ordering a salad but until then, I guess I'll be bypassing the restaurants.
