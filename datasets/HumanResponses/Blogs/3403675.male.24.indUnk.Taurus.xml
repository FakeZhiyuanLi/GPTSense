       08062004 today i witness my 2n or 3rd dog euthanesia....the sight of the aunty was even more depressing as she held back wat would seem a tide of tears n saddness the aura of hurt filled the room n as the green light for death came along i was there to witness it....it was different from the C.O's dog as it wailed its last cry tat sounded like a final 'Why??' it was silent n quiet like a v. sad goodbye as i touched the lifeless carcass for the last time with a light pat like a 'god speed' a cold chill filled the room as if its soul lifted...the lady returned shortly after with the swell in her eyes and a slice of tissue in her hand her tear were tat of a loss of a really good friend and companion...many years of innocent friendship n tons of laughter....sad is this day sad......i'm not totally devoid of feelings actually...i still feel pain and hurt....or at least i shared hers today.....

       1: the dream  last night i had a anime cartoon moment like dream i dreamt i was in a hanger observing female pilots,pilot robots manouvering them like they were goin for war as they were lining up and all suddenly the air-horn sounded n it was an air raid...the sky rained Scuds and they fell like rain a dud fell thru the roof ripping the concrete as the opening cracks ripped into a huge hole i could see the storm for a sudden moment the look of defeat on each of their eyes and a song in the background became their anthem....dream theatres 'hollow years' den the screen morphed int a cream colored screen, jus the outline and a few patches of my back like falling into a pool of milk,a radiated ripple formed from the side and all was silent.... admist the silence i awake to find myself on the opposition...  2: baby had a long day yesterday....lecture n all in the morning the afternoon was spent self studying and all and in the evening a meeting (i tot it was a lecture) i had the day to my self...cat called in the aft to ask if i was off....we met in the aft,chilled and visited the farm.... she left shortly after....in the eve i was home all done with dinner n all about to topple n baby called...we had a conversation which didn't go so well....the differences between us became more prominent in a way that i was pretty ok with the way things are and wouldn't mind change taking stuff slowly..baby had a mind of her own n after an exchange of opinions we're left at a cross road again....i was very upset and bothered by the whole thing i couldn't sleep and tumbled in bed till i dozed off....i woke up somewhere in the middle of the night...feeling totally crappy....the buried feeling of sadness shot up to the head like a bullet thru the head...delayed effect?? i was so upset bout the whole matter i was on the verge of tearing.....its a pretty busy morning and a pretty slow afternoon... the day sems to pass so slow and i wonder hows shes doing........i'm still reflecting on the conversation feeling so down..........i used to b stronger.....like nothing could harm me or something like tat... guess there 're some up days n really down days...i feel like my lungs r trying to move up my throat.....

      things to check out for during an operation  1.Heart Rate-using a stethescope to monitor heart beat e.g total heart beats in 15 sec x 4 (every 5 min or when asked by the vet surgeon)  2.resiratory rate-observe the blue air bag during surgery e.g total number of expansions in 10 sec x 6  3.CRT or mucus membranes on the gums-applying pressure in the gums and observe how long it takes for it (the gums) to recover its original colour    4.mucus membranes(tongue)-observe the colour during surgery to see if it turns  pink(good sign) or Pale(Bad sign)  5.ISO fluid-the amount used should be reflected in the report to the surgeon so the surgeon can determin if more or less amounts should be administered,complications arise when the animal is either very old or pregnant or other wise,the heavier the dosage the riskier the animal is....    how to replace a can of oxygen  when doing surgery the typical surgery takes up 2-3 black notches of oxygen displayed on the gauge if the amount you see is in-suffecient it might cause death to the animal involved so always check the pressure or amount of oxygen in the tank, the upper gauge is to display the air pressure of the outlet and the lower gauge tells you how much pressure and oxygen is left in the tank  . turn off the valve in the old tank . unwind the device attached to the head of the cap (loosen) . using the proper tool to unscrew the cap off the old tank n place cap on the new tank (remember to tear off the 'in-use' tag) . screw on tightly . tighten mechanisam attached to the cap but not too tight so the disc won't rupture or   spoil (consult vet b4 tis move) . using a kidney dish with soapy water produce as many bubbles as possible . with a sponge wipe the nut connecting the head to the tank and the outlet nuts (this process is to check for air leakages) . check the gauges to see if the outlet gauge displays a rise in pressure and the lower   gauge too... . after installation check back after 30-45 min if the pressure drops or the connections    to the tank (e.g nuts,bolts or the mechanisamm on top of the cap) is loose . record on the tag the date of usage and dun tear off the 'in-use' tag till the tanks    empty then replace new tank with these steps all over again

      i learnt tat even at the height of ur game calmness n being relaxed n clear minded with the spirit to learn/de brief  is the key to success example ppl tat play pool real well have a habit of smacking the ball in real hard into the pocket cuz its kind of an ego thing with tat last "kiak" as the black 8 ball rolls in with break neck speed or take example bowling yesterday some ppl like to spin it some jus throw it some use all their might to fling the ball into the pins only to end up in the 'drain'  'they're lousy wat!' or 'wah leow!!!!' r words of bitterness n the stubborn [its impossible or i can't lose] syndrome also known as the 'kiasu' disease esp in singapore but when u evaluate the situation n try to keep calm n use the learning spirit to evaluate the situation to try another method u find tat 'hey tis works man' or 'tis is the last time i'm doing tat'.... like mayb lightly with precision tapping in the black 8 ball or moving your wrist jus a tab to the left.....its not so hard if it works u jus found another way to do stuff but if it dun den its bout determination....'everythings possible, its jus how badly u want it'-adam khoo and if ya lose or things dun turn out the way u want it too (which always happens) dun get sore...get even hahahaha kidding evaluate n see how things went wrong...attack an obstacle from multiple angles the out come is seriously different....'always attack ur enemies strong point cus he wont b expecting it be in the middle of the battle cus thats living'-sal bandini.....with all tat said dun u think its funny?? some ppl work n slop all their lives n gain nothing...a routine tats all life is...some jus kick back n suddenly their rich but not everyone is like tat some work hard to maintain a stable carraer at the end of it ya gotta ask yourself...are u happy??? is this wat u want or is this where u see yourself 5 yrs down the row the young chaps would go ya den job hop the older chaps probably dun have a choice...all of us...fickle minded....so does it mean if i chill everyday i'll be wat they call happy go lucky??? mayb,maybe not 'god only helps those who r willing to help themselves'-the bible   jus a thought... think about it.....
