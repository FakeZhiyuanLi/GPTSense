       I recently had a conversation with a friend of mine about his expectations of women.&nbsp; He said that he expected them to know how to cook and clean, and most importantly, he said that he expected them to be nurturing.&nbsp; He said that when he realised a woman was really a little bit of a slob, or messy, he would be surprised.&nbsp; He automatically assumed they would be neat.&nbsp;   I started to think about this and as a woman I started to get riled up.&nbsp; What do you mean women NEED to be nurturing?&nbsp; Aren't we supposed to be able to be just as heartless as men?&nbsp; Really, we are in the 21st century, we're career women, we don't have time to nurture every man that expects it.&nbsp; They want us to act like their mothers did, and wasn't that a different time?&nbsp; I feel a little bit heartless saying this, but as a woman I do not feel I need to be nurturing.  Their is another side of womanhood though, motherhood.&nbsp; I find that here my expectation of a woman changes.&nbsp; Here, you've taken resposibility for a child, and I do expect mothers to be nurturing.&nbsp; I expect mothers to be a little neater.&nbsp; No,&nbsp;I don't expect toys to be picked up, who has time for that?&nbsp; But&nbsp;I do expect dishes to be done and there to not be a general layer of filth.&nbsp;   That said, I also have different expectations for a father than I do for a man.&nbsp; As a baseball fan there is a perfect example of this difference.&nbsp; A man will dive in front of a little kid, practically elbow him in the face, and refuse to give the kid the homerun ball that the man just caught.&nbsp; A father will go out of his way to catch the ball just to hand it over to his child.&nbsp; Not the most noble gesture in the history of the world, but still a fatherly gesture such as it is.

       Paul and I were eating breakfast at a family style restaurant called Leon’s.&nbsp; There was a baby that wouldn’t stop crying.&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I wouldn’t have been able to tell you that except that Paul pointed it out.&nbsp; I didn’t even notice, but I do have&nbsp; theory about restaurants and children.    1.&nbsp; McDonalds and other restaurants with a “Play Area” – children are a given, shut up about it and go through the drive through if they bother you that much.    2.&nbsp; Family Style meaning $5-$10 entrees – Children will be present, hence the title “family style”.&nbsp; If you don’t want kids look for the “Families Without Children” restaurant.     3.&nbsp; Buffets – Duh!&nbsp; Especially breakfast buffets on Sunday.&nbsp; There will be children any place you can only pay $2.50 for your child and not worry about all the food they will waste.&nbsp; Also, once they get the plate in front of them of what they “just had to have” and decide they want something else, no big deal.&nbsp; Just get up and get it.&nbsp; The perfect place for the parent with the whiny and picky child. &nbsp;   4.&nbsp; Restaurants $10-$20 ex. Fridays, Applebees – This is where it gets slightly more complicated.&nbsp; Children here are fine during the day, but once it gets to be about 8 pm, well, take the kids home and let me have my really expensive, kind of good strawberry daiquiri in peace. &nbsp;   5.&nbsp; $20-$40 Restaurants – Children should be seen and NOT heard.&nbsp; This is where you take a well behaved child over 10 as a special treat.&nbsp; Let them get dressed up, order their own meal and talk quietly.&nbsp; If you gave birth to a demon spawn that runs around a restaurant do not expect me to sit quietly while your child wastes the money I’m paying for the atmosphere. &nbsp;   6.&nbsp; $50 and up per entrée restaurants – If I am paying over $50 a person your child better be at home with a babysitter.&nbsp; I am there to enjoy the atmosphere, my food and probably my significant other.&nbsp; Maybe the company of a small group.&nbsp; I am not there to tell you your child is so cute and look how well behaved they are sitting at the grown-up restaurant. &nbsp; &nbsp;   These are by no means rock solid guidelines, I am sure there are plenty of other places where I don’t want to see your kid.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

       Last night I watched "The Apprentice" on T.V.&nbsp; No, I didn't miss the boat, I am watching the series again.&nbsp; When reality T.V. first started I didn't watch it.&nbsp; No Survivor, no Big Brother, no Real World, no Bachelor.&nbsp; I thought I was above such things.&nbsp; Now I seem to love reality T.V.&nbsp; My 2 favorites are The Apprentice and Last Comic Standing, but I am not above shows like Next Action Star if I happen to see them.&nbsp;   I hate following the crowd, really, I hate it.&nbsp; If a book hits the best-seller list before I read it chances are I will never read it.&nbsp; If I read it before it hits the list, I comfort myself by thinking that everyone followed me, I was first.&nbsp; I know, I'm a pompous ass but I can't help it.&nbsp; This is why it actually bothers me that I like reality TV.&nbsp; It's the new craze and I don't want to like the new craze.&nbsp; The only comfort I take is that I still don't like reality TV that involves relationships, especially marriage.&nbsp; That way I can tell myself that I am only watching the "quality" Reality TV.&nbsp;

      I was bored last night and couldn't sleep so I googled myself.  I didn't expect to find anything but. . .there I was.  Sara Stevenson from Kankakee Illinois and Bourbonnais Illinois.  Now that can't be a coincidence so I clicked on it.   This is some of what I found.  My self esteem just went into the toilet.  I was confronted with an ultimately more successful(and in my mind a more talented and sexy) me.  It wasn't me.  It was another Sara Stevenson from my 2 towns in Illinois and born in the same year I was.  I found her resume and she is graduating this year with a masters in architecture.  She graduated from Olivet Nazarene University with a prestigious womans award.  She is realising her dreams and I just sold out mine.  I wonder if I could pretend to be her?

       Recently a very good friend of mine wrote a post about how lazy he is.  I recently(tonight) had a similar lazy experience.  I am extremely hungry.  My freezer is filled with 2 kinds of food - bakeable and microwaveable.  Now it's not like baking food is a whole lot harder than microwaving it, but the fact that I actually have to get a pan out just made me cross everything bakeable off my "maybe i will have it for dinner" list.  A pan.  One pan out of one cabinet. Sad.

       I start my new position tomorrow so tonight I am up late from nervousness.  I decided to put the time to good use so I took a 7 day HTML course in about 1 1/2 hours.  I went to this website  and now I feel like I can finally start comprehending this stuff.   I'm sorry if this gets annoying but of course   now I have to play with my new found knowledge.   This is going to be   a boring post to read but it's being fun for me to write. This is  Paul  and I.  I wanted to experiment with an image too.  Paul is the greatest man I've ever met, except my dad and brother of course.

      I do not have a phone this weekend.  I normally have a cell phone through work, but I recently switched positions in the company.  I start my new job on Monday, so Friday I had to turn in my old cell phone and on Monday my new department will issue me a new one.  So for the weekend, no phone.  I am trying to convince myself this is a good thing.  I am independant for the weekend.  No strings.  No attachments.  It's not working.  basically I just feel like I am out of the loop.  I now have an obsessive, possible unhealthy, connection to my e-mail.  Having no phone sucks!!!!!!!

       So I am a little behind on this whole internet thing.  I know, I'm 25.  That means i am supposed to run to the computer the first time a questiohn pops in my head and google the answer.  I actually used to look things up in an encyclopedia, I know, practically the dark ages!  The more I explore the internet the more I realise I was way behind.    Today, I was listening to the radio and heard about this website called snopes.com.  I know that you have probably been there and read everything that could possible be important to you and now it is old hat.  I had never even heard of it before today.  With the help of my friend Paul I also discovered thestraightdope today.  I know, way waaaaaaaaayyyyyy behind.   If I was watching a movie before and saw someone i kind of knew but wasn't quite sure where i knew him from i would just put it aside and finish the movie.Now, i have to stop the movie and jump online, go to the imdb and look up every possible thing about this basically unknown (and unimportant) person.  I'm not sure it wasn't better before I knew the imdb existed.  unfortunately, there is nothing i can do about it.  I am now an addict.

       Like I said earlier I am freshly heartbroken, and by freshly I mean yesterday.  I think we can eventually settle down to be friends but for now I feel like my chest was just ripped open.  It is Sunday and I have the house to myself so I have settled into a comfort myself day.  I have a 24 pack of Mt. Dew(the nectar of the Gods!), peanut butter and chocolate cream Oreo's, and my copy of Legally Blonde.  This is a movie that I thought I would hate.  I saw the previews for it and thought to myself "Great, another dumb bitch gives women a bad name."  It is not like that at all!  I highly recommend this movie to women everywhere and most especially heartbroken women.  It is an "I'm better off without him but not without men in general so it is not bitter at all" movie.  Plus it has the added benefit of making you laugh, a LOT, while you watch it.  It is a funny, intelligent(i know, who knew?), and uplifting movie I highly recommend.  And after you watch that one, move on to Legally Blonde 2, Red, White, and Blonde.  You won't regret the time you spend.

       I always thought I would be going to school to follow a dream.  I now find that I am going to school to follow a paycheck.  I've always wanted to be a virologist.  I planned to major in biochemistry and then move on to masters and PhD area.  Now I start school for my bachelors in Business Management in 3 weeks.  It's a far cry from studying virology I know.  I have worked for my present company for 2 years and in my field for 6.  Somehow in all that time I never managed to start school.  I always thought virology was a passion.  But if it really was a passion I should have found a way to start school for it by now, right?  I have advanced in my job a lot in 2 years.  I start my 4th position in the company next week.  I've pretty much gone as far as I can without a degree, though.  So now I finally enroll in school.  It takes a dead end to get me to start something new.  I've always thought I was a driven person, now I'm not so sure.

       This is something new for me.  I am not used to writing anything for others to read.  It seems like I should have to demonstrate some basic writing ability or at least a miniscule amount of intelligence before I could write where other people actually get to see it.  But thankfully that isn't the case so I am going to subject you to my opinions, ideas, and lack of skill.   So what do I say about myself?  I am 25 years old, freshly heartbroken, starting college from scratch in 3 weeks.  That's scary stuff.  I have been in my current job for 2 years but I've been in sales for 6.  That does not mean that I am a liar though.  I am always amazed that people think lying and sales go hand in hand.  I don't sell used cars so no need to lie(to all of those used car salespeople I apologise).  I rent a 2 bedroom house and just got a new roommate.  It's hard learning to live with a new person but she is pretty cool.  I am originally from Chicago area and my parents still live there.  I love to read, and read, and read, and read.  Wow, this is pretty boring so I will wait and let you learn more about me through future posts.

       I went to see Princess Diaries 2 tonight. It was predictable, written for teenage girls, and an excuse for everyone in the movie to have their own solo. I loved it!  But enough about the movie. I went to see this one alone. I kind of like doing that, it gives me a chance to people watch before the show. There was a woman with 4 girls that sat in front of me. 2 of the girls looked to be about 10, 2 of them looked to be about 7. The way this woman acted made me think about a few things.  I tend to think that the more “perfect mom” someone acts in public, the more evil they are at home. Taking that into account, I think this woman beats her children, starves them, and then locks them in the closet overnight. She was planning their Halloween AND Christmas parties with them. Already. In august. They were talking about the games they would play, the HOMEMADE snacks she was going to make for them(yeah, mom. Zombie rice krispies sound great!! So cool!), the costumes she would sew for them, and the Santa suit she was going to get for their dad to play Santa at the Christmas party(Sorry to anyone who thought Santa was real).  They were talking about dinner tonight. She was making each one of them their own favorite dinner. Cheeseburgers and fries for two of them, spaghetti for one of them, and chicken nuggets with fries for the fourth. She bought each one of them a small popcorn and drink. Then asked them all what kind of ice-cream they were going to get at the Baskin Robins after the movie. One of them didn’t like ice cream so they were going to stop at the store and get her some cookies. One of them said something negative(I don’t remember what. Really, who cares what a 7 year old says?) and the mother said, ”Now let’s not talk about that. Remember, we like happy thoughts.” Oh, yeah, someone is gettin’ their ass whooped tonight!

       “Men always lie about other women, and women always overreact to other women.”  My best friend Sara said this to me recently.  I’ve been thinking this over and I have a couple of thoughts.  Providing the man isn’t cheating, I think this statement is true and the fault usually lies with the woman.  Let me explain.  I like to think of myself as pretty open and trusting.  I know that the person I am seeing right now would never cheat on me.  I trust him implicitly.  But, when he tells me he is spending time with a female friend I get a twinge.  I stomp it out quickly(usually) and remind myself that I trust this man, but still a twinge.  And sometimes this twinge leads me to over-react, be a little more possessive than I want, or need to be.  Given the fact that I tend to overreact to other women(not in the “oh my god, you slept with her” way but in the “oh really, your gonna see her?  Ok.” But im not sure I really meant ok kind of way) I think I would have to forgive a man for lying to me about a female friend.  Now I am in no way excusing a man who lies about a woman he is cheating with.  Also, don’t tell me you are hanging out with your buddies and have me find out you were with a girl, that will only lead me to thinking you were cheating.  But go ahead and downplay the friendship.  If men over-reacted to my male friends, I might downplay them too just to avoid the drama.   When it comes down to it, I know I can act dumb sometimes when it comes to friends who are girls.  I don’t mean to but let’s face reality, it happens.  I can’t think I am the only girl who does this(in fact, in comparison to others I think I’m pretty tame) so I don’t blame guys for downplaying the importance of their female friends.  It really is our fault.  We have forced them into this position.  It’s either lie to us, or face our drama.

       I have a lot of quirks.   That's what I like to call them, this way it sounds cute instead of mentally disturbed. Everyone has quirks, right?      So I like to play with numbers, on my fingers. Let me explain. When I see a number, be it on a clock, an overpass height sign, an exit number, a license plate number, etc. I start playing with it. I cut it in half, double it, cut it in thirds, then add it all back up to make the whole number again. Not so weird you think? Wait, I'm not finished yet. This wouldn't be so bad if it was all in my head. No one else would ever know. But I play this whole thing out on my fingers. If the number is 436, I will actually flip my fingers around to make this number, and adding them all the way back up. And I do this all in the base system of the number. if the number it 3 ft 6 inches I don't just make it 36 and half of it is 18, i cut it in half in the base 12 system. Same with time, I use the minutes and seconds. It's ok if you don't understand what I mean, I probably didn't explain it well, and, really, it doesn't matter. :)      Weird you say? Not even weird yet. I do all of this without knowing it. All of a sudden I will stop and notice that my fingers are pressing into the steering wheel making number 356, the last exit I passed. I am constantly doing this. I don't know how to stop! When i consciously try to stop I do, but only until my mind wanders. Then it starts all over again.      Please tell me I'm not the only one who does things like this. Please? Someone?

       I've been called a picky eater in my time. I happen to think I just have an advanced palate. I recognise good food when I taste it. Everyone else just eats any crap that comes their way, like mushrooms. How can anyone eat mushrooms? Really, they taste like dirt.       Here is a list of foods i won't eat. . .wait, that's too long.         Here is list of foods I will eat:      1. Any type of meat as long as it wasn't anything you would normally consider an internal organ. And it has to be cooked well done. No pink at all!      2. Corn, but not creamed. Creamed corn looks like puke or baby diarhea.      3. Potatoes, any kind but baked. Also, no red potatoes. Basically fry them up or mash them. That's about the only way I'll eat potatoes.      4. Peas, but only frozen ones that are cooked in the microwave with butter on them. Canned or cooked over the stove no way! Too mushy.      5. Fruit, except for melons and bananas.  Well, I will eat watermelon, but no other melon!      6. Any kind of dessert, as long as there are no nuts in it.      Yep. Thats about it.       Now, I will say that things are starting to get better. Someone came into my life who is actually showing me that onions and seasoning can be a good thing. He also has convinced me on several occasions to try things that I normally would never put in my mouth(get your minds out of the gutter people, im talking food here) and I will say that it wasn't always terrible. I even enjoyed some, ok, most of it.      But mushrooms still taste like dirt. Really!

       It is 3 A.m. and I should be asleep.  Unfortunately, I have an overactive imagination.  I am not afraid of real life.  People look at me weird because I leave my house unlocked.  Well, not anymore because I have a roommate now, but I used to.  I also am not really worried about my car being stolen.  I used to leave it in my driveway with keys in it.  I know that's not the smartest thing in the world but I never really thought anyone would take it.  I don't worry about being in the "bad" part of town.  I think I never grew out of the "I will live forever" teenager point of view or maybe I just have a naive view of humanity but I always feel safe, at least with people.      Zombies and aliens on the other hand terrify me!  I went to see the movie Dawn of the Dead with Paul and we had to turn around and go see another movie so that it could help clear my mind.  I was afraid I would run into a zombie in the parking lot.  That night I couldn't let Paul spoon me because that is the position the couple was in in the first part of the movie when they are attacked and the man became a zombie.  I was afraid if we slept like that I would wake up and Paul would be waiting to take a chunk of flesh from my throat.      Tonight I am afraid of alien infestations.  I just read a book where some astronauts get infected with a disease.  Except it turns out it's not a disease, it is actually alien eggs.  They get into their brains and grow until they actually explode the skull and the eggs hatch.  Do I feel a headache coming on?  Now I am up watching Finding Nemo to try and get the thought that I might have green alien eggs growing in my brain to go away.  Maybe this is why I have bad dreams.

        I haven’t had a cell phone in almost a month.  I am so starved for human contact when I am at home that I try and use voice chat on Instant Messenger to fulfill my cravings.  It is a poor substitute for my addiction.  It is like having a cocaine addiction and someone hands you a bag of sugar.    I am trying to do the self deception thing.  The first thing you do in self deception is try to convince everyone around you of the fact.  So I’m trying to convince everyone around me that I love it this way.  Who wants distractions?  I can stop and smell the roses.  I’m not tethered to everyone, I am my own person.  I get to rediscover the ancient art of letter writing(in the form of e-mail of course.) I get to get back to my roots, Live like my ancestors did.  I don’t have a leash leading to the rest of the world, after all, who wants that?    I do, I do!    Give me wireless, headsets, voice dial, brain tumors from magic cell phone rays, picture phones, dropped calls, and so many chargers I could get powered up on the moon!  Screw smelling the roses, I have allergies.  Tether me, collar me, attach me to the universe!  I don’t care if I am reading a book on the beach in the middle of summer, call and interrupt me.  Screw my roots.  If I want to know how my ancestors lived I’ll read a book.  E-mail is great, when I’m at work and would get fired for calling, but other than that, talk to me baby!    So I guess I’m about to cave.  I have to either pay to get my cell phone reactivated or, ugh, get a landline.  Do people still use those?    Hopefully I will talk to you soon.
