      I had today off and all I did was lay around the house, and eat a ton of food.  I started the day by making potato salad and stuffed mushrooms (yum).  I had to wait for the Sear's repairman to come over and fix my treadmill (which was broke when I brought it home from the store).  So my treadmill is fixed and I don't feel like using it now.  Boyfriend and I went to a barbecue at my mom's, it was fun.  I am on disc two of Sex and the City season two.  Its a great show, I have never had HBO so I've never gotten to watch it before.  I bid on a pair of Chanel sunglasses on e-bay and I won!  Sorry mom.  Time for sleep!

      Today was a great day.  I went to Sandpoint and relaxed for hours at the lake.  It was a beautiful and hot day.  I love Summer.

      Well Mondays are always such a drag.  Lots and lots of paperwork and no motivation to do it.  My boss called me today and asked if I would be interested in advancing with the company.  Sounds interesting but I don't know if I want to do anything more than I already am.  I've decided I am just not a go getter type of person, I just want to live comfortably and take it easy.  But it was nice to have my bosses' boss say they liked the job I was doing.  Kudos to me!  I ordered some purses online and I am very excited, they should be coming sometime this week.  Yea..  Tomorrow I am going to Sandpoint to see some friends and soak up some sun (hopefully).  Off to bed I go.

      Today was great!  I slept in and then we went shopping all day.  We drove to downtown Spokane to shop at Riverpark Square.  This weekend was Hoopfest so there were thousands of people all throughout the streets.  Parking cost $15.00, what a ripoff.  Well anyways, I spent a alot of money.  I bought clothes from Abercrombie, Banana Republic and the Gap.  We had lunch at the Sawtooth Grill (yummy!).  Then we went to the Valley Mall, I bought some more clothes at American Eagle, and the Gap.  Got a new purse at Wilsons, and we paid our bills!  So yes, I am addicted to shopping!  Now I will be broke for two weeks, oh well.  We went to dinner at Rancho Viejo (it sucked).  I rented "Sex and the City"  season two.  I plan on walking on my treadmill and watching the DVD's for entertainment.  We watched half of "Euro trip", but Boyfriend was too sleepy to finish it.  Ah, tomorrow is Monday, my busiest workday, I am not looking forward to it.  I might take a trip to Moscow to check on the manager there.

       It is only noon and it is already 1000 degrees outside.  My house is a mess, and I have to go to work now.  One of my packages is stuck in customs, so god only knows when I will ever get it.      I am very grouchy today.      Boyfriend is leaving me for the weekend so I am sad.

       Well my birthday was great.&nbsp; On Saturday morning I went crazy doing cartwheels in the yard.&nbsp; By evening I was trashed and literally bouncing off the walls.&nbsp; I sang lot of Karaoke and did a lot of dancing.    &nbsp;  On Sunday I couldn't function at all.&nbsp; We had a "picnic" at mom's amd I got a cute princess birthday cake.    &nbsp;  On Monday (my real birthday)&nbsp; I still could hardly walk, but I managed to get my nails done and go out to dinner.&nbsp; It was fun.    &nbsp;  Today is Thursday and i am STILL sore..........    &nbsp;  And NO, I still haven't received my package.     &nbsp;

       Its 1:00 in the morning and it is still 90 degrees in here.&nbsp; I am never going to be able to sleep.&nbsp; This house sucks.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Momma came over and cleaned my house for me while I was at work.&nbsp; That was really nice, now if only I can keep it straightened all weekend.    &nbsp;  I didn't do anything tonight, I rented Sex in the City season 4 and vegged out in front of the TV with some junk food.&nbsp; It was definitly a relaxing evening, besides the heat wave going on.    &nbsp;  I am sleeping in tomorrow (today actually).&nbsp; That is, of course, if I can fall asleep.

      I had today off.&nbsp; I spent the day being lazy, did some walking on the treadmill while watching soap operas.&nbsp; Did some shopping (not online).  My damn package still hasn't came, I am very upset.&nbsp; Since I placed that order I have already received five other packages that I ordered afterwards.  I'm going out on Saturday night for my birthday, I am excited.&nbsp; I am going to sing some karaoke and make a fool out of myself.  Well I guess I'm off to bed....

      I am so sick of waiting for my package to arrive.&nbsp; I ordered three bags: two Louis Vuitton and one Christian Dior.&nbsp; It has been over a month since I placed my order and still nothing.  I really hope I am not getting ripped off.  &nbsp;

      Wow, what a great weekend I had (being sarcastic). &nbsp; First of all, yesterday was my day off.&nbsp; I woke up with horrible cramps so I decided I would lay in bed all day.&nbsp; My phone rings and it's work calling.&nbsp; Apparently for some unknown reason the big front window at work has broken, and is slowly crackling away.&nbsp; Its the entire front of my store. &nbsp; So it is Sunday and you can't get ahold of anyone.&nbsp; So I drag myself to work to figure out the whole situation and when I get there I see that the entire thing is smashed. &nbsp; Anyways to make a short story long It took hours to get ahold of someone to&nbsp;check it out&nbsp;and I had to close the store down while they temporarily "fixed" it.&nbsp; So the sales for the day were $16.00. &nbsp; So what's next!!!!

      Today my car broke down on the side of the freeway, it was the worst day ever!  First, I realize that my car is no longer accelerating, then it is completely not running at all.  So I pulled over to the side of the road.  I started walking down the freeway, and the grocery store was close by.  I walked off the freeway and towards the store but there was a huge fence with barbed wire on it.  I had no choice but to climb over the fence.   I ripped up my favorite dress and cut open both of my feet and my hands.  So here I was, stranded with blood pouring down my foot.  I had to have a tow truck come and get it.    Now I don't know what I will do.  To top it all off, I still haven't gotten my order in the mail.  I have been expecting my purse' for a month now.  Waaaaaaaahhhhh!!!!!!!!

      i am posting this title in the hopes it will motivate me to stick to a diet.  I have gained a lot of weight in the past few months.  I am very bitter towards people that are losing weight successfully and looking good.  I don't like being this way, I have a terrible attitude.  Anyways, my goal is to stick to a diet for at least one week.  After that, we'll see...

      Well today was payday and I immediately spent my whole check.  I just can't seem to wait until payday comes and then I spend all my money in the blink of an eye! I guess I just don't make enough money to last throughout two weeks time.  I love buying stuff online, I just recieved my Chanel sunglasses in the mail the other day and I love them!  Its cool because I get to shop in the middle of the night and early in the morning without ever having to leave the house.  I just finished watching season three of Sex and the City, it is a great show, I am becoming obsessed with it!  I am currently still eating up to four bagels a day, I think I am going on week three of non stop bagel eating! LOL....

      Okay....Once I eat something that I really like, I continue to eat the same thing for many, many days.  I'll be on a taco kick, then a hamburger kick and so on.    So right now it is bagels.  Bagels for breakfast, bagels for lunch, bagels as snacks, bagels at midnight.  With cream cheese, or butter, or chedder cheese, Bagel sandwich...you get the picture.  I can't stop eating said food for about a month or more, and after that I am so sick of it I won't touch it for weeks afterward.  Oh well, gotta go, I am craving a bagel.

      i just wrote a really long blog and the damn thing didn't work and now I am pissed. So now I don't even remember what the hell I wrote.  My car door was broken and I took it in today and apparently some bolts had fell off and my door was gonna fall right off the hinges. They fixed it though (for free).  I was going to have the weekend off but now I have to work because the new manager at the base sucks and I need to give her some "guidance". And there is an inventory in Moscow on Monday so I have to go down on Sunday and do an audit and then on Monday I have to be there to supervise it. It sucks cause I will have to stay the night there on Sunday and I will miss my boyfriend.  TGTIP (thank god tomorrow is payday).  If this doesn't publish I will cry.

      Well I had a blast at the concert.  I got pretty trashed though.   I am taking an online class on nutrients.  Work will pay me to take it.  My car got fixed yesterday.  I had something wrong with my fuel injection or something like that.  My car seems to break down every week now.  I wonder what will be next.  My newest obsession is Von Dutch bags.  I really, really want one.  Bad.

       I just realized I am so broke, I have absolutely no money at all!!!!!!      I got my nails done today and I thought I had money in my account but it turns out I am very very broke.      My car's check engine light came on yesterday and now my car is running like shit.  Its going to break down soon.      Boyfriend is out of town for the weekend, how sad.

       Well this has been a fun filled week of redoing the entire store.  Its called a reset, we take everythiing off of the shelves and then put it back on the shelves in new spots with new shelf labels and signs and stuff.  We have to do it once a year.  So I've been pretty busy.      Mom won tickets to the Brad Paisley concert.  Its on Sunday at the ski resort on the mountain.  She is going to also win back stage passes at 9 this morning.  At least I have a feeling she's going to. lol.       I bought a pair of seven jeans online for super cheap, I got them in the mail yesterday and they are obvious fakes.  I am very depressed but I guess you get what you pay for right?  They cost at Nordstroms $178.00 a pair and I bought them for $75.00.  I should have seen the red flag but I am an idiot.      Well anyways TGIF everyone!

       I usually have Sundays off, but I had to work because all of my employess needed it off.  It was so slow, I had no customers for the last half of the day.  It was boring but I got lots of paperwork done.      I am very sad because one of my managers quit this week, it sucks because she was just starting to bring up the numbers in her store.  And now I have to train a new manager, and the one we hired is old.      I bought tons of stuff online this weekend, I'm excited.  I finally have a great, dependable person I order from who sends my stuff right away.

       I really hate waking up at 6 every morning to drive bf to work.  It really sucks, mainly because I stay up too late every night.  I will be so happy when his truck is finally fixed and things get back to normal.      I've had the last two days off, its been very nice.

       Yesterday was an exciting and adventurous day. I went skydiving, mountain climbing, bungee jumping and river rafting.       After that was all done, I robbed a bank. Then I took the cash and went to the casino. I won $500,000 playing Texas Hold'em Poker. I took all of my winnings and spent it on alcohol and drugs.    Then my fiance' and I decided to fly to Vegas for the night and elope  .  We partied all night long and it was great fun until I woke up and realized I was in bed with some dirty bum.      So this morning we flew to Mexico for a quickie divorce and now I'm broke.      The End..................

      The question always crosses my mind whenever the Boss comes into town.  And she will be here tomorrow.  I am always so paranoid.  In part to my guilt that I don't work hard enough, but also because since she took over my region she has fired 9 managers.....OUCH!  So I always have to cross my fingers and hope for the best (the best for me, I mean).  Meanwhile, I have a new package that is now MIA.  I have been expecting it since July 19 and its still not here.  Geez, will I ever learn?

       Well just another hectic Monday.        Yesterday Boyfriend's truck broke down, I guess the engine blew out.  Now I'll be  taking him to work at 7 am every day until he gets it fixed.  Which will be a couple of weeks.      Its hotter than hell in my house.  Last night I almost went outside to sleep.        Oh yeah, and my refrigerator broke.  So all of my soda's are warm.  YUM!
