      I have learnt my lesson well. The truth is out there I can sense, Dunn look back and be surprise ... Live your life till the last puffs ...   Tommorrow the last paper ... I just received an sms from Juli, wishing me be strong ... I really appreciated. And Liza, trying to find a person to drive her to the airport. As much as I wannt to see her off at the aiport, but I can't. I am still stuck with the last jargon.   And this is the first time, I study all alone without my mom or dad's actually support. Man, stop the Sudirman's song.. I know .. not now .. later, day of tomoro .. Dunn need to remind of my folks....  there's is a lil boy still at the corner of greenacre road,   he's been sitting down there all week long, he is studying hard, knock to the ground,  and he start to say, still studying for the last paper ....  what about me .....  while i pass this time  so listen , what about me .. nobody change, and i feel cold and lone... and i guess i luckly , some i ask for more ... WHAT ABOUT ME ....  What about me .....  No mom's cooking, no daddy's wise words... All alone studying thru the lates nites ....

      Seindah tiada lagi kau kuingatkan Sayang kau hilang Menanti biar sampai akhir hayatku di dunia ini  Kau tahu betapa kusayang padamu Hanya bidadari sebagai ganti Hanya takdir menentukan ia Oh belaian jiwa  Oh angin sampaikan laguku padanya Yang sedih pilu Terimalah laguku jadi teman hidupmu Untuk selamanya  Kau tahu betapa kusayang padamu Hanya bidadari sebagai ganti Hanya takdir menentukan ia Oh belaian jiwa

      Tertutupkah sudah hatimu Untuk menerima ku lagi Apakah keras hatimu Tak bisa lentur lagi Bukan ku sengaja Mahu kau terluka Bukan niatku  Kalau pun memang Aku bersalah Namun sebesar manakah Begitu susah utk kau maafkan Hingga ingin kau singkirkan Bumi yang manakah yang tak pernah basah Bila hujan mencurah  Aku usah berubah Usah diturutkan hati marah Di hati kecilmu Ku tahu kau tak begitu  Sudah lumrah cinta Suka bersulamkan air mata Kita dihiris rencana Terpetik cinta sukunya  Kita buang keruh yang melanda Kasih pasti jernih semula Tak siapa di dunia merasa Cinta terlepas sengsara  Tanpa rajuk hiba Tak ketemu makna Nikmatnya cinta

      I love this lyrics, keep singing, keeping reminding me of home, Razak, Holland Ville, Adam Rd, Alif, and last Tekong ... Oh, and my dad, mom, my bro and my gf .....  ---------------------------------------------------- Di sepi ini aku mencari Sinar matamu Lama ku tunggu tidak ku temu  Ku ayunkan buaian cinta Di pohon duka Berguguran keindahan kernamu  Akan ku simpulkan tangis ini Memaut harapan yang tenggelam  Airmata berguguran Menyapa penantian Yang kecundangan  Cinta ku kau persiakan Tiada arah haluan Terbiar sayang  Akan ku simpulkan tangis ini Memaut harapan yang tenggelam  Airmata berguguran Menyapa penantian Yang kecundangan  Menjelmalah wahai sayang Biar pun sekilas pandang Oh di mataku  Di dalam keresahan ini Inginku mengadu rindu

      I am really sad and worried for my JAVA subject. It is really a tough jargon industry for me. I dunn know wherether I can pass this subject or not.  CSCI213           Java Programming Assignment Test 1 = 75%                   Java Programming Assignment Test 2 = 95%                   Java Programming Assignment Test 3 = 75%                   Java Programming Assignment Test 4 = 60%                   Java Programming Assignment Test 5 = 80%                   Exam = 18 June 2004 ????  Technically, I scored 38.5% out of 50% for my assignment. And I need 12% marks more to pass. But the stupid university states the rule that I have to pass my exam, in order to pass the subject ... Which means... If score 12% more, I still failed. But if I score 25%, scrapping thru the paper, getting 63.5%, means I straightly get a credit. Wierd top IT school in Australia ...  Anyway, I just pray to HIM that He will guide me and pass my subjects...  Amen.

      A tall slim and graceful woman who walks proudly like she is walking in a beauty pageant competition. If she slips or nearly falls, she will nicely covered it up and continue with her graceful and impressive walking step. She knows how to use make up to enhance her beauty. She looks at the world positively, so her face always seems so happy. She will not get up set easily.  Self confident woman who believes in her own style. She will not follow fashion, but standing in between simplicity and too modern. She is a very open person, sometimes can be too blunt. She is an honest person and never try to cause troubles for any one. She likes to say something that you do not want to hear and yet she can say something so pleasing at the same time. Example she may say "I wish you could make more money, so you could afford better cloth, but anyway it is better this way. If you make more money you could be thinking of money too much and become greedy". She can say such thing and make you wonder if you should get up set or love her more.  She is also a free spirit and does not like to stay home. She likes to be protected, but not to give her orders. She has no respect to a weak man. If she try to over powered you, then you have to calm her down and try to control her to be in a limit by doing the same thing too. She will listen if she respects you. She likes to be herself and like her guy to be himself.   She is a no nonsense woman, so you will not hear she says "Guess what I will do next", or "Guess what I am thinking" because she always say what she is thinking out loud like a guy. If you do not understand her in this matter, you could easily break up with her. She sees problems in her love life as another funny story.  She is clumsy and it is in her nature. You may think it is cute, but for some neat guys this could be so unbearable. She is very friendly, so she can easily turn her enemy to be her friends. She has good taste in fine cloths, good food, first class and first services. Even a poor woman in this Zodiac will struggle to afford such good taste. She could spend lots of money as if she can not understand how difficult it is to make money. If you think of let her borrow money, think again.  She is a paranoid. If she thinks you like her, she may already think about getting married and lost her freedom and so on and on. A jolly woman who loves sports. She is an ordinary woman who could dress like a tomboy. She has more guy friends and sometimes could act like one of a guy. She does not care about rumors, so she can get home very late and couldn't careless what her neighbor will gossip about her. She thinks either good or bad, you will know it yourself, so you should not bother what people think.   Her wit and innocent look are her charms. She is often hurts from love, but never afraid to look for a new one as if she is singing "Do that to me one more time". She likes going straight and being straight forward. She will not go around to get what she wants, or beat around the bush just to say something. If you meet her and tell her straight what you think, she will admire you.

      Frankly, I am really very disappointed. My girlfriend was so fussy about the T.A.G Board. But, she never left any message on mine. I dunn really understand, what goin on with. Usually, she supported the idea. Is this one of the signs from them?  I only left with 1 paper to go. 1 Jargon Player. Java. I really hopefully about to pass. I woke up early, to pray Fajr. Lately, I think He is watching me. Cos, I can feel in my nevres.... I just wanna to pass all the subjects and get on to the next sessions, Insya-Allah.

      A tall slim, cool and quiet woman. Once she is mad she can be very fierce. She can work better than some men and she is very highly confident woman. In her opinion, woman is not just a flower or decoration at home or at an office and certainly not a weak sex who needs protection.   She likes to control and hide her weak emotions. She will never try to change anyone, but she will learn to accept them as they are. If she does not like someone, she will not comments or criticize but she will completely ignore that person.  She hate plastic and an artificial flower because it make her feel that you are not being sincere. She loves real flower and its scent. She loves a guy who wears after shave cologne. If you are a type of a guy who wears your Jean one month before washing, or wear an old sneaker, then you can forget about her.  She loves music and nature even there is a rare case otherwise. She loves to go picnic in nature, so if you don't have so much time for her, you can take her fishing too. She is not as jealous as Aquarius or Leo woman, but do not cross the line O.K. Better not to see she gets mad, especially in front of public when she feels like loosing face. She loves to make up and dress perfectly and very neat, so never rush her for this matter.   She has her own goal in life and does not care if you have a doctorate degree or not, if she thinks you are not bright then she will not care about you at all. She likes smart people by character not by certificate shown. If you cannot show her this quality, go and take a bus and go to the next stop.  She does not like a dreamer who talks about his dream but never put his hands in action to make it happens. Don't bother to tell her "everyone is doing it, you should do it too", or "I think you should do it, it's good for you", because she will do what she wants to do only.  She is a neat and tidy person, so if your apartment is a pigsty, do not take her there. If you go out on a date with her, try to be presentable such as nice and clean dress, clean nails or else it will be your last date.  She is a cool type and will not nag, so easy on your ears. She is a slow but sure type. She will always respect and honor you and will never try to make you loose your face. If she loves you, she will help you in anything you do.  She likes to help people and expect nothing in return. If she asks you for a favor and does not get one, she will feel very disappointed. She has a high hope and a high faith and beliefs in her own confident than believing in "Luck".  If she is your wife, you will have nice and clean home and a gourmet cooking. If your parents visit your house, they will be please. She is a 3 in 1 means , a perfect mother, a perfect housewife, a perfect wife or you could say "happily ever after".

      A man who loves social life and curious about every new progress, new development to make sure he is in the era and always have all up date information. He likes to know what the latest trend of fashion is and make sure he is not out of style. You can easily spot him at the grand opening of new pub, new restaurant for he loves to participate in social activity.   There is a few Sagittarius who is a private person as well, but you could see that he will be ahead of his friends. He will know what is the best seller book, what are the top 10 hot hit of the week. The hottest movies showing now, he must have already seen it.  He hates routine, it makes him bored. He likes to get to his goals and succeeding in doing so is his true reward. Money making is O.K. but it is not his true joy, for he can easily spend them in a short while. They say if you want the truth, go and ask Sagittarius. They are right, you can ask him and he will tell you all the truth and very straight forward. Even he may speak bluntly, his friends loves him. If you have problems, all your friends may feel sorry for you, but Sagittarius will be the one who will give you a helping hand first and even expect no return favor. That's why he is a real charmer even sometimes big mouth.  When he is mad, he can be quite fierce but quickly dissolve and easily forgotten. He is not a person who will take revenge, so if he say he going to burn down your house, you can relax. He likes compliments and sweet words, so you can manipulate him easily. If he knows you are not sincere, you will totally become meaningless to him.  Some Sagittarius are gifted musician, or singer. He is a happy soul, has a good humor and has lots of jokes. He loves freedom, lively and very energetic. If he is working, he will take his job seriously. He likes to travel, likes to see new exciting places. Going out or traveling make him happy.  Sagittarius man is like a free bird. He lives as if everyday is Sunday. He will hardly be in a bad mood, but if he is in a bad mood, you will better leave his sight. If you want to talk to him in such mood, try to avoid issue of commenting his life. He flirts like other man, but he has a built in brake, so he will come back to you by himself. If he disappear for a few days, not to worry for he is only recharging his battery to be that same lively person again, them he will be back.  He has allergies to Pretty woman, so in love with many women for him would be normal. Setting dating schedule is his games and it's fun for him, and this will keep him from being bored. He hates obligations, so the word "marriage" would suffocate him. If you allow him to have freedom, he will not go anywhere.  He falls in love as easy as he catches cold, especially if she is cute, funny and she has a strong personality. No one can tell how long he will be in love each time. If you want to really hold Sagittarius man, act like you are in an adventure movie. At all time, you should make yourself lively, tells him some jokes, always be cute so that it will ease up his allergy to other pretty women a bit.

      Network Technology have define our life to "feel so near, yet so far." I was quite really pretty glad when see Hafizah online. At first, glimspe, I thought she was at Foley St, but nope. She is in Singapore.  This show technology have change our life. The defacto is that I do chat with my galfriend everyday. I always feel so near to her. But realising that she was a distance away from me.  I just want to see my Dad badly. Give him a good warth hug from his son. And today after Isyak prayer, Shiek Abdul Rahman, spoke to us about a Hadith regarding death and funeral. I am really sad when I heard that speech from him. He really make me feel that I want to go home.

      Life have never been so quiet. I thought I am the only bloke, who now feel down. Firdaus, a buddy for the last 4 months do felt the same feeling, when Hafizah and Juli left this morning.  Sunday Morning, 13th June 2004. UOW Library, once against. I am starting to kick off my studies with BUS316. Frankly, I don't really know, how to pass this paper. Insya-Allah, with his guide, I believe I will. That is also if I put in a little bit of effort.  Tommorrow, my girlfriend will be going to NIE to an interview. I really wish she make thru the interview and become a teacher. Maybe a language teacher, who teaches English. Then, it would be more practical for me in future, I were to relocate and she were to tag along with me  The Hazzie Show... was pretty dramatic..... Tears drop quite a couple fo times. Anyway, i got to continue studying ....

      What do that both person mean to you?? Mr Sandman or Mr Dreammaker?  Sometimes, it does really frighten me at nite, when meeting both of them. Last nite, I was talking a stroll on the street with my dad and brother, after meeting my mom's side(relative). It wasn't a good visits, cos everyone is blaming me for imgrating to Australia, while my brother chooses another destiny path for his life. Dad just tagging along with us.  Lord, what does this mean... Soon after a kilometers of walks, we met an accident, killing both of my loves. I am really feel depressed and sad. They just left me alone to finishes the stroll to the end of the gate.   Sound familiar, right? This is like my current situation in Australia. I am living on my own two feet, walking toward to the end of the gate. my destiny path is still a long way to walk . I need a person to walk me home, with the background from Mandy's song ...   Walk me home,  I dunn all the way alone.... Baby, will you take my hand, baby, come to a special place ...  And, I am still typing all the way....  I have to bath, get ready for the journey to Jervis Bay, near Nowra. I am going to watch the miggration of whales !!! I say again WHALES !!!! I never seen whales before... Lord , please please , let's me see the Whales, that Prophet Ayob took..  Whales is one of the magificent creatures, Lord have created. And one of the creatures, that have play a part in Islamic's history. Insya-Allah, he will allowed me to see one of the greatest earth creature, with a pleasant journey. It will be about 1hr 15mins drive from Wollongong.

      Legend has it that men make the first move. The truth is that women have always made first move and orchestrated the pace, flow and direction of romantic relationships.   Masters of intuition and emotional manipulation, women are adept at body language, able to gauge the emotional temperature of a room quicker than our nipples stiffen in a breeze. You can bet your next G&T, if we're on our way over, we   advertisement were the one who lured her there.

      First time in my life, I have witnessed so many new muslim in my life. I have attended two days seminar by Shaik Kalid Yasin, an Afro-American. He does gives preaching to the open society. The first day it was regarding The Historial Jesus, latter was The Hidden Treasure of Islam. This lecture is held in Liverpool, Whitnam Hall, Sdyney.  A lots of youth attended this occassion. Some of the are not even Muslim yet. The gals are really pretty, I have no comments for that. Always from, I would walk in with a non-muslim gal and covert her for the love of my religion and love.  Ops, I have a girlfriend. I guess she will be reading this. I really so lonely. Witnessing 6 gals accepting Islam, was really one of the gracious time for me... I never seen stuffs like that before.

      I have known her longer than my girlfriend. She is one of the few girls inspired my dream chaser project, a girl who have guild me thru in my decision ending up in Australia. Curtin is only of my top choices, when they offered me a double degree, Bachelor in Bussiness Administration and Computer Science. Yes, I do have the idea of going to school with Hazlina Hanaffi, way before last year.   One of the reason, why I am not heading for Perth, even not for Murdoch, due to the recognisation. Wollongong is still one of the top for the IT industry. That why I am heading for Wollongong. And Wollongong is really a distant from Perth, even also from Sdyney.   80km down south, sitting below than 15 degree, sometimes reaching about 0 degree. It does really can make me feel homesick. Hafizah Hashim, Juliana Jamal, Nurliza Kamarudin and Nuradlin Ayob all are back in Singapore. Even, Rahizan Zainuldin also have headed back home.   I am only left with this Firdaus Zakaria. He is a good man. But, sometime I am do really feel down, to some issues maybe, I am too sensitive. Which I gues I am, currently now. I need friends, friends who I can trusts, jokes, and going to place where we can enjoy ourselves... Just like my brother, Abdul Razak A. Rahman. I guessed, Razak still the best, no one to replace his accompanionship.  My girlfriend? She is great, I am thankfull to God, till today, I am still with her. But just lastly , I am really quite ignore by her characters. Just that she is not used to be the collage gal, I love so much. True, she is trying to change herself so much. I can see her losing her weight and her hair is dye, brown...   I told her I prefered gals with highlight hair, not brown. But .. it alright, I am not fussy about that. Cos, shw look much interesting now with bown hair. There is she online now. Just give her a minute , she will click and try to cath with me. For now, it is alright for me.   But during exam, she kepe talking wired stuffs to me . That really making me pissed off. Anyway, i am already happy with my girlfriend. But, if she want to be anger with me asking me what is wickedweasel gal? I dunn really care.  I am really feel to the maximum of boreness in my life. Hoping on the July 1st, I would clear all my exam and pass with credits. Insya-Allah.  Yupz, sometimes, in the middle of the nite, my tears do flow out. I never cry in my sleep, thinking about my dad, when i am in the army. I guess Australia, this phase of life is much tougher than army ....  All I wise was November 27 to come soon...

      The last 7 Days was really my best day in Australia. I dunn really felt the stress as students. My Singaporeans friends, Rossman and Sharizan, came down from Brisban. We travelled a few places, jokes around, spending the time of the greatest.  7 minutes laters, they will be on the country train to Melbourne. I was planning to join the crew, but budget was my limit. I really fell heavy to reject join them.  I am really appreciate, with Rossman staying over my place for the last 3 nights. I do enjoyed cooking for them, Lemak Chilli Padi and Chilli Honey Chicken. Usually, I only chat with him thru the net, but now, we jokes and teased each other. I didn't know this pray would grant him  Sharizan, a great hilarious bloke. I didn't know he is from NYP too. Cool, power... At least, we have something in common to chat about NYP life ... And jokes too at nite.  Guys, I you really read this .. I really have a great time here ... I really enjoy myself. Thanks for comming, and accompony me ... I really appreciated it very much Really going to miss both of you guys. Hopefully, ya back to 'the gong' before leaving for Brisbane.

      singaporeansinuow.cjb.net's web team plans to joint venture with Temasek Society and Malaysia Associations For Students, in providing their club member with the community service. Their associate members now will be able to know each other events, club's news, etc. They can also participate in the discussion forum.  The web team will be appreciated if the plan will be going well, and this will be another milestone for the site to give services to the community. This will also encourage the two groups to work together and bring the live of students in Wollongong.

      We have just emailed to all our Singaporeans friends and close friends, promoting about this community site. This community site is completely done at a Beta Version last night, around 0245hrs, Sdyney time. The uploading to the free ftp servers was really a painful time bomb. Lots of errors were prompted out during the process of uploading to the server. Anyway, it's a free server. No comments can be made from that issue.  Cool, now every part of the intergrated designs is working, although there are some bugs can be identified from the site. We are still looking into the matter. No hurry ...  Hopefully, by the end of this week, this site will progress with more contents and lives here. We really appreciate all your support.  Cheers, People At Haxmanz Technologies. Bridging The Community Networks.     "Networking doesn't only exits in technologies or relationship. It mean a wired world bridging everyone together into a common goal"

         "Flying Singapore Higher"  My fellow Singaporeans, When I was sworn in as Prime Minister on 28 November 1990, I pledged:   "to ensure that Singapore thrives and grows after Mr Lee Kuan Yew; to find a new group of men and women to help me carry on where he and his colleagues left off; and to build a nation of character and grace where people live lives of dignity and fulfilment, and care for one another."  It has been 14 years since I made that pledge. Though this National Day Message is my last, I address you with a happy heart.   Our economy has grown significantly. Our society is  more compassionate, open and gracious. We have inducted a capable group of younger leaders. As a people, our bonds have deepened. As a nation, we are maturing. We are now more confident of who we are, and what we stand for.   The first seven years produced bountiful harvests. We distributed the fruits, and helped lower-income Singaporeans.   The next seven became lean years. First, Southeast Asia was struck by the Asian Financial crisis. Then followed September 11, terrorism, Sars and economic recession.  But we did not throw up our hands in despair. We rallied and fought back. We worked and grew our economy again.   And together we defeated Sars. It was a frightening time. A good number of our loved ones died. This was my saddest moment in government.   But our collective response to Sars and other crises strengthened my confidence in Singapore's future.   We went through fire together; the steel in us strengthened.   This is what I am proudest of, my fellow Singaporeans, this fighting spirit, the character of our people, our strong bond and social cohesion.   Many of you have thanked me for taking care of Singapore. Tonight, I want to thank you. I have had the privilege of leading Singapore. I could not have shouldered the responsibility alone. I am deeply grateful to you, my fellow Singaporeans, for your support. And the support of my Cabinet colleagues, Members of Parliament and my Party.   The responsibility of taking our nation further will now rest on the shoulders of the next generation of leaders. How do we fly Singapore higher and further? I want to share with you key lessons which I have learnt over the past 14 years.   First, Singapore's future depends on the commitment of its people to the country.   Building a nation is not like building a block of flats. It is not just a matter of laying bricks and pouring concrete. Material wealth alone is not enough to root Singaporeans to Singapore. More important are the emotions and intangibles that bond us to our country - our shared values and memories, our families and friends, our progress as one people and our common commitment to a society where each of us can achieve his or her full potential. I believe that Singaporeans will love their country more when they feel valued and have the opportunity to shape its future.   The second critical factor to keep Singapore going is trust - the trust between the different communities and the trust between the people and the Government. The discovery of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) network after 9/11 shocked our people. I was worried that it could break the trust between our Muslim and other communities. I remember our first dialogue session at Kallang Theatre with community and religious leaders. The anxiety was palpable. We explained why the Government had made the JI arrests and that they were not targeted at Muslims. We urged non-Muslims to reach out to the Muslims. We also urged the Muslim community to integrate more with the other communities.   I was relieved when speaker after speaker - Muslim and non-Muslim alike - rose to support the Government's actions. They condemned the terrorist plot as the work of misguided individuals. They emphasized that the plot had nothing to do with our Muslim community.   We could deal with race and religion so openly because of the mutual trust we had built over the years. We have deepened this trust with the way we handled the JI episode.   The third critical factor for Singapore's future success is the quality of national leadership.   Singaporeans are not naturally drawn to politics. So we have to systematically seek out good and able people and persuade them to become MPs and Ministers. And amongst them, there must be at least one who can eventually take over the controls.  Politics was not in my blood. I was asked to stand for elections in 1976 by the late Mr Hon Sui Sen, who was then Finance Minister. I accepted. It was my duty and privilege to serve the country. I had benefited from how Singapore was run. Like many of my generation, my family could not afford to send me to university. I went through university on a government bursary. I advanced in my career because Singapore was not run on the basis of race, family connections or money, but on equal opportunities and merit. By the time Mr Hon's invitation came, I was the managing director of Neptune Orient Lines, leading a comfortable life away from public glare.   I never dreamt that one day I would become your Prime Minister. When I took over from Mr Lee Kuan Yew, many people, including my grassroots leaders, worried for me. At my first National Day Rally, my friends feared that I might fall flat on "live" television. After I finished my speech, I could hear the collective sigh of relief. The audience clapped! And I saw Senior Minister Lee beaming away. He looked immensely relieved. He wanted the younger team to succeed. Had I failed, I would have jeopardised the process of political self-renewal.   Like Mr Lee, I have paid much attention to leadership self-renewal. Planned, orderly transition is what distinguishes Singapore. In other countries, the politicians exploit the divisive forces in society to get elected and, in the process, pull their countries apart. I call this the "politics of dissension and divergence". In Singapore, the political leaders do not fight for personal power or gain. Instead, they mobilise the society's energies for the nation's collective interest. This "politics of consensus and convergence" is the best way forward for us.   I have piloted Singapore for nearly 14 years. Everything is in good working order. The economy is growing strongly. Growth in the first half was 10 per cent. For the whole year, we can expect growth to be between eight and nine per cent. Now is a good time for me to hand over the controls to a new captain and his crew.   Hsien Loong and his team will face different and tougher challenges ahead. The world has become more uncertain. The global economic environment will be more competitive. We must expect lower-skilled jobs to migrate to lower-cost countries. Older, less-educated workers will have to be retrained.   Hsien Loong will also have to deal with fundamental changes in Singapore society. There are fewer babies and more old people. He will have to manage the rising expectations of the younger generation. Many more Singaporeans will live and work overseas. He must make sure that their hearts continue to be Singaporean.   I am confident about Hsien Loong and his team. They are ready to take our nation to a new level. But they cannot do this on their own. They will need your full support and active participation to fly Singapore to greater heights.   I am very happy that I can leave the office of Prime Minister at a time of my own choosing. I do so with full confidence about Singapore's future. We may meet the occasional storm but we will pull through.   I will be there with you too. Hsien Loong has asked me to stay on in the Cabinet. I have agreed to do so.   Tomorrow, when we celebrate our National Day, my heart will fill with pride for Singapore.   My fellow Singaporeans, serving you has been the highest honour of my life.   I wish you a very happy National Day!   Taken From    Updated Aug 8, 7.50 pm (Singapore time)

      PRIME Minister Goh Chok Tong delivered his last public address to the nation on Sunday night with a 'happy heart' and thanked Singaporeans for supporting him during his 14-year tenure. In his National Day message, PM Goh also urged Singaporeans to rally behind the new team of leaders taking over to help shape the country's future.      In retrospect, he recounted that Singaporeans had enjoyed seven years of 'bountiful harvests', followed by seven lean years, marked by the economic downturn and last year's devastating Sars outbreak  But Singaporeans did not give up, choosing instead to rally and fight back.  Mr Goh said that things are looking up again with the economy growing at 10 per cent in the first half of 2004, and the full year growth expected to be between eight to nine per cent.  In his speech telecast on Sunday night, Mr Goh shared key lessons he learnt over the years on how to keep the nation together and 'fly Singapore higher'.  Singapore's future, he said, depends on the commitment of its people to the country.  'Building a nation is not like building a block of flats. It is not just a matter of laying bricks and pouring concrete. Material wealth alone is not enough to root Singaporeans to Singapore,' he said.  Mr Goh said he believed that Singaporeans will treasure their country more when they feel valued and have the opportunity to shape its future.  He said the second critical factor to keep Singapore going is the trust between the different communities and the trust between the people and the Government.  PM Goh cited the discovery of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) network, after Sept 11 World Trade Center attacks in the United States, as an incident that shocked Singaporeans.  He said he was worried that it could break the trust between the Muslims and other communities here.  But he was relieved when Singaporeans, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, supported the Government's actions in making the JI arrests, and that they 'condemned the terrorist plot as the work of misguided individuals'.  Mr Goh mentioned that third critical factor for Singapore's future success is the quality of national leadership.   He said that Singaporeans 'are not naturally drawn to politics' so the Government has to 'systematically seek out good and able people and persuade them to become MPs and Ministers'.  Mr Goh also said that Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, 52, who will take over the reins of power on Aug 12 had asked him to remain in the Cabinet, but did not elaborate on his role.  PM Goh said that DPM Lee and his team 'will face tough and different challenges ahead,' but he was confident that they are ready to take Singapore to a new level.
