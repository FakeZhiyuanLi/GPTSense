           What a terrific day i had in the cricket!!      Today i tried to bowl fast instead of medium from the start itself. as i am fresh today i am able to get speed i needed. and i bowled really fast and ball fell on right areas. i was elated by this though i got only one wicket, i am able to contain the runs => I WON THE MATCH!!  i have to try this when all the main players are present.      Tomorrow will be a boring won as others are going for exam supervision. i was also trying to go for  it. but its too late. hmm!

      play it cool:     I should explain why did i choose this as my title. From time to time i have experienced this. whenever a crisis/problem/important thing comes, most of the time i will get tensed inside though i wont show it. result: Bad show. a lot of things happened by this way. my graduate seminar (at M.Sc) and the list goes on but sometimes when i really get cold i can come through it specturalry. result: entry to IIT (Indian Institute of Technology) and ...    the same thing in cricket too. whenever a situation comes i will try to play it cool. and mostly the result will be positive.     i think confidence also plays  a important role here. becaz most of the times i am not confident at all. this sometimes give me advantage as there will be no expectation from me for me. so that reduces my pressure/tension.     it was exactly what happened at my M.Sc . when i was trying to prepare for the examination i didnt think/expect getting into iit. i want to improve my knoweldge on chemistry and i was reading regularly at the vacation.even at the time of examination i dint think abt that. i was just relaxing-sleeping well at  my brother's room. and at that time of examination i was really cool and i was wondering when i saw junta studying and discussing furiously before the examination whether i will be upto the bar. even some of batchmates are disucssing(acting? i now wonder) this and that. so there i was, thinking abt nothing and went to write the exam blankly. After exam i rarely discussed the answers and almost forgot abt. the same thing happened for NCL(national chemical laboratory) entrance examination. but for this exam i started discussing answers a bit but some of friends had different anwers for which i was sure that i was correct. so i stopped  discussion. after these esaminations i went back to my home from chennai and almost didnt think abt that.  and i was abt to get or i got (i didnt remember exactly, but i'm sure i didnt apply)application for bharathidasan university.     then the result came for NCL .   BANG!!   i was in 43rd position and though the seats are half of that. but i was assured that i can get as top ranked will be going somewhere else (IIT!). so i was preparing to leave to pune. at this time there were hot discussion was going on between me and my parents.  at this point i should tel that at the time of applying to NCL they turn red and started scolding me when i told i want to apply to pune- which is atleast 1000km from our place- for my MSc. the application was merely hundred rupees. and they were reluctant to give! after peruasion from my brother they agreed. though i was irritated by my brother's domination( thats different story, later i can explain it). Finally, after so many discussion with lot of people they agreed. meanwhile i asked my brother to check the status of my IIT exam. i dont think he checked and he told i didnt get thru it. Then the day came. i was ready  to go trichy ( which is 35km from my place) for booking ticket to pune. the train was at 12.30 and it came -   BIGBANG!!!    A letter from IIT. It said i were in the waiting list and it moved, so i got admission to IIT. i cant believe myself! but my parents are not convinced whether i should got iit or pune. i made the decession but still they count. again afte a lots of discussion they agreed to IIT though the fee was very much higher than pune.   SO I GOT THROUGH IIT  - One of the premier institutes of India and argueably asia. i think i started somewhere i ended up somewhere.

      Today i had a mixed day. In the morning itself fight started. rajeev againg playing politics. i and rajneesh got very much irritated. i am slowly knowing the things abt world. i never thought fight will come over money.  In lab... well, as usual there are power cuts. god damn.. i dont know how i'm going to work here.frequent power cuts almost spoiled the day. the distillation i started didnt go even half. no work.. just roaming here and there.  even i am not able to get signature of ramiah sir's.its badluck for me. as i kept looking for him. but...hell... he went early today. but in cricket, i had a good time. three wickets in a over. one run out and two stmpings, credit should also go to keeper. and another match though no wicket, i bowled well. in batting.. its poor show. i had to hit since i wont and didnt get many chances. In the night it was better.i'm able to continue the distillation. but i dont know whether it finish before 12 as it's a rule( i hate it!!) here: either leave before 12 or stay upto morning. okey, that's all for now.

      so, i am gearing up for my first blog ever!  to startwith... my birthday.. yesterday. i expected a call from my mom&dad, though i didnt expect from my bro. since i didnt callup on his first marriage anniversary last month. i felt very sad for not calling him. i was struck up with my work on that day. after that i didnt feel to call him as felt ashamed. as expected he didnt call though  he knows it.  but i recieved call from mom today. she said that my phone didnt work, as they were trying atleast ten times yesterday. hmmm! lets see how it goes. i know i had to more consistent in this regard. i too know that i cant.   anyway, the only gift i recieved yesterday is from my labmate. she gave me a cup, though a simpler one, i felt somewhat happy. other labmates thought they know it... well, i didnt expect from them. my other new friends doesnt know abt my b'day. again, i felt may be .. shy to tell to them that TODAY ITS MY B'DAY!.   so thats my b'day celeberations. the celeberations is decreasing every year. hope the trend doesnt continue.
