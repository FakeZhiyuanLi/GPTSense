      This is a program where you save animals, people,the world.  We need more people saving the world. Feed dogs veggies not meat  because what meat does is make dogs more savage and mean.  You can also start like a little liter program were you pick up liter from everywhere. You can also start adoption agencies because alot of animals are killed either because they are abandond or nobody adopts them or stray. SO BE COOL AND HELP THE WORLD!!!

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Haven't figured out how to earn NPs yet? Well, here are a lot of tips:   Open a Shop. List your shop on Neopets Fan pages, the Notice Board, or in the chat rooms. Join a web ring on Neopets. You can search the shop wizard for extremely cheap items. Turn around and sell those cheap items for much more!  After you open your shop and started getting money. Take half of it and put it in the bank and use the other half to stock your shop. Start your shop off with food items. If you buy them from the main shops, but can sell them for 10 times the price you bought them at.  Go to Advent Calendar and collect your prizes in the Month of December.  When you are making trades, check the prices of the items on the market wizard. This way you can be sure to get a honestly good deal!  When doing the faerie quests, it isn't worth doing the Earth Faerie Quest. She tends to ask for really expensive things and feed your pets in return.  Try to get free things from the snow wager. He sleeps at certain times of the day. You can turn around and sell the things you get for free!

      &nbsp;  urlLink Bank  - Collect Interest! This can add up over time! If you have 100,000 NP, then you can collect 9,000 NPs a year! Make sure you collect your interesting before you deposit or withdraw! If you don't collect your interest, you will lose it for that day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink Fruit Machine  - You can visit the fruit machine once a day. You never know what you can get! Anything from food, to NPs, to petpets can be won at this machine! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink Healing Springs  - Have a sick pet? You can visit the healing springs once every thirty minutes to try to heal your pet. The Water Faerie will either feed your pets, give you a potion, heal your pet of disease, or restore some/all of your HPs. Sometimes she will both healin your pet, feed your pet, and restore HPs at the same time! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink Laboratory Ray  - Have you collected all of the lab map pieces? If so, you can then visit the lab daily! The lab can both do your pet good &amp; do your pet harm. Either way, it is fun to see what the lab ray has in store for that day.. ;) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink Giant Omelette  - This neverending omelette will help supply you with one omelette a day. An omelette will feed your pet three times! This is helpful for those that can't afford much food. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink Coltzan's Shrine  - Hmm. What will Coltzan give you today? Sometimes nothing happens. (Well, it seems that most times nothing happens for me...) But, if you are lucky, Coltzan can improve your pets stats, give you food, NPs, or battledome items! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink Check your Stocks  - Do you keep NPs invested in the Neopian Stock Market? It's wise to check your stock daily! You never know when stock prices rise or fall. So, keep an eye on your investments! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink Tombola  - Over on Mystery Island, there is a Tiki Tack Man that gives out all kinds of things. Though, sometimes he needs NP donations to help fund his giveaways. All you have to do is show up once a day to get a lottery ticket. If you win, you can get anything from NPs to Faeries! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink Giant Jelly  - Oh Yum! You can't pass up some FREE FOOD daily! Your pets will thank you for it! This is another great daily event that can help keep those pets of poor neopians well fed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink Wheel of Excitement  - This wheel costs 150 NP and can only be spun once every two hours. You never know what you can get with this wheel! You can get anything from 8 NPs to items worth over 100,000 NPs! (Sometimes you can even have items stolen by the Pant Devil.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink Wheel of Mediocrity  - This wheel costs 50 NP and can only be spun once an hour. This wheel doesn't have as good as prizes as the Wheel of Excitement, but it is still worth the spin.
