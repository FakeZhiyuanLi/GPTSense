      well i got back hme from MSBI (missouri state band institute) yesterday and let me tell you i think that was the funnest week of my life...nooooo joke!!!! I met sooo many awesome people and i cant even begin to explain how cool they were. I cant thank sam and paul and huston enough for tellin me about it!!! I think that my most favorite person i met was samantha tho cause she was sooooo awesome!!!!! we are like totally alke and people accually mistaked us for twins (like 4 people) b/c we wear the same size clothes and weboth have same hair length and we act the same (THIS IS FOR YOU SAM-killer squirrel, rape whistle, gutter s*ut hahaha, certain someones we had crushes on and incedents like that, hangin out in the girl br couch then relizing what they mustve done on this couch, secret brick, secret window, secret phone booth lol, riding the conveyer belt that we put our trays on, our specialty suicide drinks, and soooo many more things man!!!)  but camp was fun id wake up at 6 and shower get ready, go to breakfast, hang up in sam and pauls room w/all the guys till sectionals. Wed have sectionals for about an hour and 15 min (i think i lost my tag thing) then wed got to band prac. for 1 1/2 hours (i was 2nd chair), then lunch, the more band prac for another 1 1/2 hours. Then wed have the snack break, then for i had Jazz Improv(not so fun...u have to use ur brain) and the session 2 which for me was Jazz (1ST CHAIR BABY!!! AND I IMPROVED A SOLO AT THE CONCERT!) then wed have dinner, hang in dorm room or w/e then from 7-9 every night we had evning activities like go to brady commons, ultimate frisby, scavenger hunt, talent show (me n sam were in it...i played green day and he sang. and friday night was the dance and there are MANY funny stories from that. heeheeheehee.   so much stuff happend and even tho im SO happy to be home and be in my own bed and not have to share 8 showers w/25 other girls in the mornings i will still miss like EVERYONE from camp and if ur from camp and ur reading this...I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!  wow i had a lot to say....  today i did nothing...i went to softball practice and then relized we didnt have practice so i had to wait like 30 min till i could call my dad to come back and pick me up and then we went to jason's and ate ice cream (which reminded me of derek at Eva J's when he got the HUGE ice cream cone that one morning and was licking it and we were all like eww that doesnt look right) and then i came home and layed on my futon that i got when i got home from camp and watched degrassi and talked to sam t, ashley w, alex f, and micah s. and they gave me some good pics of msbi! ahhhh i hope i dont keep thinking of it cause im sure ill annoy all my hometown friends w/stories.....but i know ill see all of u msbi ppl next year and maybe even at SEMO!!!!! we are such band losers but thats ok!! good night(or good morning in my case 12:42am) ~erin

          THE BESTEST STORY EVER    Written by Aleksy and Erin at 3 in the morning. On July 29th, 2004  &nbsp; Its 3 in the morning, as the gnats hit Erin's computer screen, annoying her to death, as Aleksy Conjures all his magical strength into exercising the demon Gotenmaru. Well not really but it is more exciting then saying Aleksy was online talking to Erin. Not say it was a bad thing but to anyone who on looked it was easy to get lost. The conversations could only be understood by those two, who were almost inseparable. They would spend hour upon hour talking and would love it. As time passed they talked away the night and had numerous conversations which is why it was just nothing special that night as the gnat hit Erin's screen. Or was it? See Aleksy and Erin were secretly spies for the AABW (Awesomely Awesome Black Warriors). So they had to talk in code. What Erin thought to be a annoying little gnat....happened to be a camera. As she told him about the gnat or as it was known in secret code camera. Aleksy soon figured out this was no gnat this was Gotenmaru the leader of all power rangers all of the sudden Gotenmaru coughed up a hot dog and explained. He was irradiated by a freak lab accident and now poops his pants every 5 minutes. It gave him powers beyond all imagination. Like pooping powers. Super pooping powers. He could spray people 100 yards away with crap. By lab accident I meant lab like dog ,That explains the poop and the smell. The poo was green implying it was super. And it was runny implying it was poop. Aleksy and Erin Look at each other totally Disgusted. Aleksy and Erin soon figured out that if we took this green lab dog poo and placed it into a bottle and fed it to our gremlin friends that they would soon turn to robots. It was so obvious. Why didn't they think of it before? how dumb could they have been? but then suddenly Aleksy drank the poo!!!! the poo turned Aleksy into to Erin and Erin in to Aleksy. and we looked at each other and decided it was destiny...why hadn’t they seen it before? They decided to have a E-marriage and have Ryan Ott as the Priest…..THE END!

People are being so weird this summer. oh well i shouldnt worry about other people i guess.....ahhhhhhhhh. Last night Jessie spent the night. We walked up to Mikes house to only find out the football practice was going on and we felt sooo dumb b/c we didnt even remeber prac. started at 6. lol So we came home and we made cookies w/our names and watched the big lebwoski and we made commercials for pepto bismol and laxative and wart remover hahahaha. good times.  "applejack warts"   &nbsp;  Tonight my family is going out to eat w/my brothers girlsfriends family...to chevys but i dont know if ill go....free food but i dont feel like going out to eat tonight i guess.   &nbsp;   If only more people were pacifist

       Today I went to the mall, got my hair cut (got some awesome bangs! yay!) and my mom and i got our eyebrows waxed and then we went grocery shopping. Then we went to the farmers market and got some DELICIOUS peaches andthey are reallllly good.&nbsp; The we came home and watched Big Fish.......    &nbsp;  I was thinking today tho.......ok heres my unanswered question, if jesus died to wash away all of mankinds sins, then why must catholics confess their sins to the father in order for them to go to heaven wouldnt god except them no matter what sin they did?......same as, why must christians not say anything to redeem their cleanliness.....i know im not that religious but soon i will be going to church w/jessie b/c my grandma streeter was a strong catholic and i learned a little about it from her, also i have just been reading about the different religions and i feel that catholisism is a very good one....but thats not the point.......maybe i just have no idea what im talking about and no one really probably ever reads this. But I just wonder sometimes.     &nbsp;  Today was a thinking day i guess haha.....ill bet none of that made since or something is worng about what i said b/c truthfully i dont know squat about religion........so dont pay attention to that. ok.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Today&nbsp;the girl that cut my hair&nbsp;said i looked like Gwenyth Paltrow : )&nbsp;&nbsp; Cool.
