       Two stories, posted at the same time, quoting the same sources, have two totally different conclusions.  How can anyone be expected to gain an understanding of what is actually going on with the economy ??  NEW YORK (Reuters) - American consumers slowed their spending pace in April and a key measure of inflation moderated, a report showed on Friday, giving the Federal Reserve (news - web sites) leeway to make only modest interest rate hikes to keep inflation in check.   And then this...posted at the same time.  AP -  Consumers — whose behavior plays a crucial role in shaping economic activity — increased their spending in April by a solid 0.3 percent, a good signal that the recovery remained firmly rooted as it entered the current quarter.

       The Power of Consumer Patriotism  I might argue that buying things at lower prices helps American consumers save money and invest in savings/retirement etc...but I know that it just makes them buy more!  So if we're going to spend, lets at least consider keeping our money here in the US.

       Associated Press - May 24, 2004  PITTSBURGH - Most people can fold a piece of paper by the time they're in kindergarten, but it's not child's play for a robot, which must use complex mathematical formulas to accomplish the task.   That's why officials at Carnegie Mellon University are excited about a graduate student who has developed a robot capable of doing origami — the traditional Japanese art of folding paper to make figures or sculptures.

       By LAURA WALSH, Associated Press Writer  May 24, 2004  WESTON, Conn. -  As the nation grapples with pumped-up gas prices, car owners are turning to their favorite restaurants for a solution: recycled vegetable oil.   Environmentalists have been using the fuel alternative for years as a way to cut back on sooty emissions, but as gas prices soar above $2 a gallon, they say their "veggie cars" are also a great way to save some cash.

Talk about nailing the thoughts of their target customer.  Nobody every says "If I'd only spent more time at work."

       http://www.appenzeller.com/  I was told that this kept the Swiss healthy...by the bartender doing shots with us in Luzern.  Rough Translation In 1902 Emil Ebneter invented the Appenzeller alpinebitterly. Today, after over 100 years, its prescription is top secret. An open secret against it is that almost any adult Swiss knows the inimitable beverage from 42 herbs and 29% Appenzeller Spirit. So we can state with good conscience that hardly another alcoholic beverage enjoys such high Bekanntheitsgrad. And we are confident that remains also in such a way.

       http://www.schwartz-pr.com  I've been with Schwartz Communications for almost 5 years  My daily life consists of working with companies to identify, create and manage opportunities to get the media interested in what they are doing.  Attaching what they are doing to current market/technology or workplace trends or creating something new for the media to run with is an important part of my job. I'm always trying to figure out the "back story" of news and events to help my clients navigate through their marketing communications actions.  Writing press releases and other marketing materials is part of the job, but the real work is behind the scenes developing relationships with reporters who trust (and therefore repsond) to what I am telling them.  I've worked on technologies such as XML and Web services for eXcelon, CRM and BPM for Applix, video over DSL for mPhase Technologies, human resource self-service applications for Authoria, network performance management for NetScout, compliance management for IBS and embedded intelligence technology for Questra. Key placements include USA Today, Investor's Business Daily, BusinessWeek, Business 2.0, Computerworld, CFO Magazine, Field Force Automation, InformationWeek, PC Magazine, CIO Magazine and many other national and local publications

       Are happy, fun, thoughtful stories less interesting ? When we travel to Maine, I'm always amazed at the amount of stories that are on the news that would never be covered in Mass.

        They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.  With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging hot spot.  Don't it always seem to go  That you don't know what you've got till it's gone  They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.   They took all the trees and put 'em in a tree museum.  Then they charged all the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.  Don't it always seem to go  That you don't know what you've got till it's gone  They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.   Joni Mitchell 1970  Big Yellow Taxi

       The movie starts out with Arthur, King of the Britons, looking for knights to sit with him at Camelot. He finds many knights including Sir Galahad the pure, Sir Lancelot the brave, the quiet Sir Bedevere, and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir Lancelot...

       Robert Johnson was a blues guitarist, singer and songwriter. Disgusted with fieldwork, he left his sharecropping family around 1930 and took to the highway, recording, in his unearthly voice, 29 songs.   Johnson's music was so good, other men said, that his talent could not be natural: Delta legend has it that one day at a backcountry crossroad, Johnson waited for the devil to come by. After that, Johnson could play any song he wanted, but he had surrendered his soul.

         I have to admit, I was more than a little curious last night as I was flipping through the channels and saw that ABC Family channel was showing Blazing Saddles !! I caught it at a commercial and just had to see just how this could be...I mean, ABC is owned by Disney !! And, this was on the Family Channel of all places. I knew that it was going to have to be edited and I wanted to see just what they were able to keep in.   I was amazed as they came back from commercial to the scene of a group of cowboys sitting around a fire eating beans. Of course we all know what happens next. But instead of hearing the usual outcome of a bean supper, the censors had filled the space with random horse neighs and winnies. The cowboys still made faces, did the lean, etc. but to someone who may have never seen the movie before, it must of been pretty confusing when someone said &quot;More beans Mr. Taggert?&quot; and he replies &quot;I'd say you boys have had enough!&quot; while waving is hat through the air. Come on now....they really needed to cut out the fart noises??!! Maybe the editors haven't seen the Sponge Bob or even Rug Rats lately.    I could only take about 5 more minutes as complete scenes were cut out and others were just (badly) dubbed.    My confusion lies in that I can't figure out why they even bothered. Surely, they could of found something else to put on that was entertaining without going through the considerable effort of hacking this classic to death.

       As in the glassy pond itself on a still morning, you can look into Thoreau and see a reflection of the person you might like to be. Henley put it well when he said, "Thoreau was everyman, and he chose Walden to be his everyplace."

       "I asked myself what Thoreau would have done." &nbsp; So this guy gets the bright idea to give away free copies of Henry's book in the parking lot of the park. Not so fast...what about book sales at the gift shop ??!! Is it the words, the packaging or the ideas that are really important for a visitor to take away from Walden.  &nbsp; Henry would have surely enjoyed the irony but without the added publicity that permeates all of life today. Let's see if he heads&nbsp;North to give away copies "The Maine Woods"....that truly will show his commitment to the cause since his actions will definitely cause less of a reaction up there. (If he sees anyone at all!) &nbsp; Part of me agrees with his principle but I'd hate to risk any of the money that helps keep Walden special.

       Got to thinkin about this movie the other day....just couldn't get the thought of "Andy" paying off his neighbors to act normal so he can sell the house.  "When Andy and Elizabeth buy a farm in Vermont, they can't imagine the trouble that awaits them. Andy has quit his job as a sports journalist and is planning to use the peace and quiet of the country to write the Great American Novel. From the moment the movers' truck gets lost with their furniture, though, there's little peace and less quiet. From a manical mailman to a dead body buried in the garden, Andy is distracted by the town and its wacky inhabitants."
