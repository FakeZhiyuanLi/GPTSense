       Today I went to this great  urlLink art deco exhibition  at the Legion of Honor. It was pretty awesome, how often do you see a streamlined, chrome-plated meat slicer? It can make ham paper thin, with  style . Afterwards, I went to  urlLink Musee Mechanique  in its new habitat (Pier 45). It was  alright . There were a lot of stupid tourists everywhere, what with their purchasing of shot glasses with "San Francisco" and an image of a cable car or somesuch painted on. The new location wasn't the same as before. It didn't have the same feel of the cramped, claustrophobic, creepy little room with strange noises in the background. The  urlLink old timey machines  were still cool though.

       After taking a glance at  Into Thin Air , it appears that my life goal of making a harrowing account of a mountain expedition gone wrong need not have the  Tuesday With Morry  element, unless, that is, seniors with terminal illnesses get really good at mountaineering any time soon.

       I was just wondering. Is orange (the color) named after the fruit, or is the fruit named after the color? Also, are we (genetically)99.9% monkey, or are monkeys 99.9% human? A cookie to whomever can give me an answer. We may never know, not in my lifetime, nor perhaps your hypothetical child's lifetime, or even your hypothetical child's hypothetical child's lifetime. Who know what, I'd say this is worthy of two cookies (no, they are not chocolate chip, so stop bugging me).

       Here is the official list of my aspirations that are to be achieved hopefully somewhere within the next 87 years:      Create a metric time system     Beat level 15 of tetris     Hike some crazy high mountain that has hardly any oxygen at the top     (optional) Nearly die in the process, only to triumphantly survive and write a memoir about it, making millions in the process. It'd be like   Tuesdays With Morry  meets  Into Thin Air .     Free the balloon people     Get a haircut     Live to be 100     Design an awesome invention that does nothing to advance humankind     Eat 8 saltine crackers in a minute     I'll get back to you, my loyal readership, if I can think of anything else.

       Check it out! David has not one, but  two  blogs. Not only do I have bathroom walls to convey my emtions upon, but also two little corners of the internet. I feel like a big man. Now, down to business,  FREE THE BALLOON PEOPLE!  Now, some of you may be wondering, "Why the crap does this kid wanna save the balloons?" Well, I'll have you know that it is my firm and esteemed beleif that inside every balloon is a small,  urlLink smurf-like creature.  It is my mission to free them. You see, back when I was growing up in the hills of West Virginny, pop always had this saying. It went, "Never leap a gift horse before the muffin batter settles." Now, if that saying was actually relevant, it would have tied things in quite nicely. Unfortunately, that is not the case. That is all.

       I hope everyone has a very enjoyable and memorable Wednes Day, the world's most popular weekly holiday! "But whatever in hell is 'Wednes Day'" you might ask? It is a celebration filled with a history of tradition. Wednes Day (pronounced "weens," the "d" is silent) dates back to a few minutes ago and is thought to have originated in Holland where it was celebrated by the ancient Hollish. You see, a Wedne was a special type of Hollish ornamental tea set, all of which were destroyed or stolen when the Dutch invaded and renamed Holland as the Netherlands (how dastardly!).  urlLink Few exist today.  Wednes Day is in memory of all those brave tea sets that didn't survive to see tomorrow.  urlLink Semper Fi.

       Today I got back from my backpacking trip in the  urlLink Ohlone Regional Wilderness . It was a doosey: 28 miles in two days. But I'm okay because I'm still in one piece, it's just that my lips are peeeling off and I can only hobble around like an old man (no blisters though!). Otherwise, things couldn't be better, I have hot food, a hot shower, and a warm bed. Life is good in the land of David.  Motto of this weekend: "That burning feeling in your legs, that's how you know you're alive."  Also: My infamous sherpa hat has gone missing! I think that I left it in the school auditorium. Perhaps I'll organize a posse to find the bugger.

        Hey man, I'm not one of those pie-pan wearing, shotgun wielding crazies. For those of you that know me, or think you know me, you can say without fear of contradiction that I'm a very logical man, right? Okay. So it's like this. I'VE BEEN PINNED&nbsp;AT THE CENTER OF A VAST CONSPIRACY. Not like, a&nbsp;"Big Brother is watching you!" or "The aliens have landed!" conspiracy. Just a&nbsp;vast one.     &nbsp;   Here's how it went down. I was merrily sitting at my computer, playing&nbsp;a&nbsp;shareware game when I get an AIM invitation from a certain "ShhBeans". How could I refuse? My hollow life could use a little human interaction here and there. So I accept. And that's when it all began . . .     &nbsp;   He kept calling me "bungie" and insisting that I posted something at  urlLink this crazy website  and had some sort of&nbsp;affiliation with  urlLink this blog . So this is all pretty crazy and nonsensical to me when it gets better: he insists I have something to do with  Halo 2 .   In the next ten minutes or so, three other people that I didn't know at all were talking to me though AIM about the same things. Are you bungie? What do you have to do with ilovebees?     Well, enough of that. In other news, I'm going backpacking on Thursday! w00+! I also got some pictures back from my last trip and will post them soon. I've assembled an "A" team&nbsp;to work on it around the clock.    David out.

       Yesterday I was walking with my sister who's back in town (she just graduated) to the movie theater on West Portal to watch  Fahrenheit 9/11 . On the way, at the roundabout by West Portal Elementary School I spotted two, unused road flares. I had to have them. I instanly regressed 8 years and instantly deemed it a case of "finders keepers." But to my sister's protest of "they've been in the street" and "what the hell are you going to do with 2 half-hour road flares?" You never know when you might get into the sort of situation when you might need that sort of thing. Like if China invades. Then what do I do? Hide? No, I whip out my trusty road flare and fight off the Communist invasion. Or, I signal for help, watch the flare die out, then ball up and cry. But still, having a flare is better than none. So she suggested I go to one of those survivalist/paramilitary storesand get one. But those are just a bunch of nuts who are waiting for judgement day and in the meantime are stockpiling arms for some vague reason. So it was either pick up the flares from the sidewalk or become a paramilitary survivalist waiting for doomsday. So I came home empty-handed. You're no fun.    urlLink Join David's Crazy Paramilitary Survivalist Splinter Group!

       I am so angry. My e-mail crapped out on me. I had this sweet Gmail beta account (hosted graciously by Google)with its 1,000 megabytes of storage. Then, all of a sudden it dies in my arms. There I am, kneeling in the jungles of 'Nam, with my wounded e-mail account in my arms. "Don't die Bubba," I plead, but it just looks me in the eyes like a lost puppy and goes to meet its maker. (Remorsefully) After that day, I never e-mailed again. The only way for me to get over the pain was to get wasted on Windex. I still have the occasional bottle, looking at old photographs of the account and me in a darkened room. I just sip my Windex and sob, thinking of what could have been, but wasn't.

       That was a pretty crazy week. Memorable, but nonetheless crazy. Right now I'm feeling pretty tired. May have been all that pie I ate. Or perhaps the lack of sleep for the past few days. Anywho, I've just gotten back from my backpacking "adventure," if you will, and am feeling quite... spent. Some highlights of this week included jumping into Sierra rivers at dawn (river + Sierras + 5:30am = effing cold beyond description), watching my buddy, Gus, puke his brains out, and getting funny looks from them "civilized" folk. Well, now for some after game statistics (or bragging rights).  Miles hiked: 70 CLIF bars eaten: 5 Quantity of Chapstick used: Ungodly amounts Blisters received: 0 Changes of socks: 2 Weight lost (lbs.): 4 Character built: Far too much Stupid song stuck in my head for majority of trip:  Lord of the Rings  theme  I am David, son of Richard, son of Edward. Hear me roar! (Thumps fist on chest).   ALSO:  For all you high falutin' city slickers going to Lick-Wilmerding, I met the principal's son on the last day of my trip. He was through hiking (doing the whole thing in one sitting) the Pacific Crest Trail (it runs over 2,500 miles from Mexico to Canada), which is hardcore backpacking. Time for sleep now.

      As  urlLink  recent events   have shown, the United States GDP is rising. Or spiking. Democrats squirm. Rebulicans laughs manically.

I implore you to ponder over  urlLink this article  from an Atlantic Monthly. Why do the two major parties value this relic from the stone age of the depression so highly?   Thus, I, Ackmed, purpose a new system. A number between 1 and 100 will be given out by the Satiricist council, and this number will tell the common-folk are doing econimically and psychologically. The units will be known as "Kutlar." With the current administration in power, many analysts would give the average to be at most 40 Kutlar. However, these analysts high up within the party have shown that if a Satirical party member were to take the reigns of control into their own hands, this number would increase exponentially, and some guess that the rating system may even have to change to account for the dramtic increase in general population happiness, well-being, and economical status.  Until then, fellow member, I ask thee, spread the word of Satiricism. Not one step back. That is all. This is Ackmed, once again, and thus I bid thee farewell.

      I am Ackmed. Controller of all that is zero's and one's. This would be my first writings of the Satiric Party blog. May I first tell you that I have been involved with the party since its very conception. I have given support to it, even when it was not "hip," as to speak, to be Satiricist. I implore you, do your duty for Satiricism and join the party.  Without furthur ado, I present some campaign slogans that you might want to use to convince your friends to join Satiricism:  "For the common good, join Satiricism!" "Take back our country!... for Satiricism!" and "Your friends are joining Satiricism, so why aren't you?"  That is all.

      The Satiric Party was founded in 1789. It has always been that way. To believe otherwise is to commit thoughtcrime. Don't give in to your "false memories".

      And so, St. Davidicus trekked to the top of highest peak in all the land. He walked for three days with neither food nor rest until he reached the very summit. And thus did the booming voice of an All Powerful Deity Of Sorts did say to Saint Davidicus, "Go forth, my creation, and convince people into doing your bidding, for fear of incurring my omnipresent wrath upon them." And the All Powerful Deity Of Sorts did grin, and like a beam of sunshine spread across the land. Upon the return of St. Davidicus there was much rejoicing. And the merry people did feast upon the pigs, and the cattle, and the sheep, and several brands of breakfast cereal that came in easy-open individual serving pouches, and did the bidding of St. Davidicus. "Sweep thine welcome mat" St. Davidicus would say, and the All Powerful Deity Of Sorts fearing folk did, for dread of his omnipresent wrath. And it was good.

      On the morning of June 6, 1904, Harry Fergeson Gloster, the father of the ideals of Satiricism, died alone and in deep debt, but his soul lived on in the hearts of those who listened to his speeches at the local pub. For the next 100 years or so, Satiricism hibernated in society, occasionally being spread from person to person by word of mouth. At this point it is believed there were never more than 75 members of The Party. But Satiricism was not vanquished, it was merely waiting, waiting for the opportunity to for the perfect time and place to be released upon society (not like it's the plague or anything).

      The roots and ideals of Satiricism can be traced to radical writings and rants of Henry J. Foster, who single handedly planted the seed of our noble ideals in the Devronshire pub,  The Raving Scotsman . On the cold evening of 16 January 1897, Henry, in a drunken rage talked of the imminent threat of a banana led invasion of Wales. It wasn't until the next night at the same pub that a now sober Foster laid down the foundations of Satiricism to a sleepy crowd of 3 fellow barflies. And so, the legacy of The Party began. Its birth signified the death of the monarchy.       It's Easier To Think When You Don't Have To -Big Brother

      Ah, another year has passed. Although once the Party starts the use of metric time, years will become 100 or even 1,000 days long. Everything before Satiricism is B.S. ( B efore  S atiricism)  and everything after the creation of Satiricism would is A.E. (age of enlightenment). In closing, have this little 2004 (1 C.E.)

      Do you have a complaint or dissatisfaction about Satiricism? Then just come on down to our newly commissioned "Complaint Services" building, also known as the Ministry of Traitor Disposal/"Processing". It's located in a luxurious warehouse that was formerly home to the Packard Meat Mangleing and Butchery Co. People with "constructive comments" can wait their turn to talk with the head complaint processor. They are brought one at a time as they sit on our deluxe conveyor belt. As they pass through rubber flaps to isolate them from the judgment of others, they begin to meet our "complainer processor" which is now fully automated. With this great new technology, many hundreds of people with comments can be "processed" per hour. At this great speed, many more people than ever before can be served with minimum effort. So c'mon down and get your meat ration at the brand new distribution center. "Complaint Services"? What in the devil's name is that? I have no idea what you are talking about. That's not screaming you hear, that's the sound of satisfied "customers".  DISCLAIMER:The writers of that last post would like to apologize to the world for that last bit. It was tasteless, foul, obscene, and seriously un-kosher. Please don't e-mail us, because we know it was terrible and would like to make amends ahead of time.

      As our potential readership of  millions  may have noticed, the timestamp format has been altered into a more logical layout with a 24 hour clock and listing the date as day/month/year. Although it is not entirely perfect, it will have to suffice until the Party can allocate the proper energy and funds needed for R&D of a metric time system. Soon the second will be as antiquated as the bushel, peck, acre, hand, or stone. As you may have known, metric is the official measurement system of the Party for it is more practical, efficient, and sensible. Push on without rest, for the continuous effort for the cause has put victory in the near future. Fight to the very last! Kamerad out.

      Under Satiricism, meaningless paper notes called "currency" are unneeded, and are simply tools of the Bureaucratic fatcats to catch everyone up in red tape. These "bills" can be simply replaced with ration points. These ration points are to be distributed weekly to every citizen of a Satiric government. For instance, 5 kilowatt hours of electricity would expend 20 ration points (RP), or 1 loaf of bread would cost 2RP. Children would be able to buy toys with their saved up ration points, workers food and other necessities, and Party members could have access to some luxury goods. With a self-contained system, these RPs could circulate down to the masses and back to the top again (think pyramid shaped). The current exchange rate is 1RP=23.1USD. Trade? Who needs trade in a global economy?! We must only exchange goods with other free thinking Satiricist states! Self reliance to the end! At times, our will and resolve shall be tested, in times of "The arduous March", we must push relentlessly forward, towards VICTORY!

Not only that, but this Kamerad Jakbute fellow is so full of GREATNESS, that if he went to a sewage treatment plant, they would think that he's the sack of A HARD WORKING PERSON THAT IS FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT he is. If you haven't noticed, propaganda has been integrated into daily NOTHING. By the time a message reaches the public, it's so garbled that it IS THE EXACT TRUTH AND SHOULD BE FOLLOWED TO THE LETTER.

      Ah, well, I've been forced to post. Or what not, but still, comrades, I encourage you to harken to my tale, so that you may support the party. You see, I met a small child, and the child asked me, "Mr. Ackmed, Why is it I can't say what I want?" The Gistapple quickly took away the small child, and he never asked a question ever again.

      That's right fellow Satirics, we're going to take the capital by storm! If our 1st amendment rights aren't enough to convey our message, I guess we'll have to exercise our 2nd amendment right and speak with our bullets instead of our words. The damn liberal commies will never know what hit 'em. Literally.  "Remember, you can't spell 'aardvark' without 'aard' or 'vark'." -Kamerad Jakbute

      With the newly inducted "Party Reading List", the blatant sarcasm of Satiric Party Headquarters can be accompanied with a more subtle, thoughtful, sophisticated satire that only articulate writers can make. But that can all change once we take control of the education system. The doctrine of the "3 R's" (reading, 'riting and 'rithmetic) shall be perfected under Satiric rule and everyone can have an equal chance at success (or failure, look at it any way you want). People aren't created equal, but we can make them equal. Anyways, back to the subject of our very first book of the month book. Start at the top of the list and work your way down, think of it as your personal crusade against ignorance, and someday, you too, may be able to be a nervous wreck, balled up and rocking back and forth at the bottom of your personal bunker in fear of the hellish fate that humanity unwittingly awaits. But why be consumed by fear when that fear can be manipulated and utilized by the Satiric Party? With hordes of other like minded individuals roaming through the streets, you can gain a sense of "belonging" by alienating others and burning their houses down. Now doesn't that sound much better?

      As you devout Satiric Party members may have noticed, the Party now has an official reading list, think of it as your very own book of the month club, except we don't read any female empowering, mamby-pamby,  urlLink Oprah endorsed prole feed.  So go forth, fellow Satirics, to your local sate run book recepacle (also known as "libraries") or use the convenient links made by our technicians. All links lead to other sites where you can buy these great books all for less than $10 +s&h. Every now and then I'll add another book to "the list." Buy Satiric Victory Bonds today! Remember, you can't spell "aardvark" with out "aard", or "vark", which begins  with "v", which stands for VICTORY! HUZZAH! HUZZAH!

      National welfare is falling apart, our planet's precious oil reserves are being depleted, and China's flooding our markets with cheap textiles has put many out of the job. Only the genius of the Satiric Party can solve this problem. All we need to do is to setup a network of rocking chairs across the country. Then, we herd consenting citizens of senior age (60+) into government constructed homes for the elderly. There they are provided their own rocking chair, knitting needles, and a daily milk ration. To create a clean source of energy, we can harvest all of that precious kinetic energy made by the rocking chairs by way of miniature generators affixed to each one. To occupy their time on the chairs, they will be given the opportunity to chat and will be provided knitting supplies. The Chinese may be able to operate sweatshops at pennies per person, but our labor will be free! Thus, after only a few years, energy costs will be lowered, the elderly will get their welfare, and trade tariffs with China may be lifted. Once again, the superior logic of Satiricism has defeated the governmental Bureaucracy and its backward, maniacal ways.

      Contrary to what many of you may be thinking, the Satiric Party is not full of blood thirsty crazies that want to take power in a bloody coup. Instead, fellow Party members, I urge you to send some of my "grandmother's cookies" to your local senator or representative as a sign that the Satiric Party is party of peace. Here are the ingredients for "grandmother's cookies": (1) 1 ft. of 4 inch PVC pipe (2) 8oz. fertilizer (3) pure alcohol (4) 7 inches of wax string (5) match (6) "Happy Birthday" greeting card. I'm sure you'll figure out the rest. While you're at it, whip up some "grandmother's cookies" for your local law enforcement officers, crossing guards, or community leaders.

      Congratulations, you've just made an important choice that separates you from the people that  want  to take over the world and puts you into an elite group that wants to take over the world  and  has crazy hair (i.e.  urlLink Kim Jong Il ,  urlLink Donald Trump , or  urlLink Bill Gates ). Now, this may shock you, but making a nuclear weapon isn't as much of a cake walk as Hollywood would make it seem; there's more to it than sticking a fuse into a rod of uranium. Now, let's get cracking!   Phase One    Stop worrying and love the bomb, goddammit! "Radiation sickness" is just a myth created by wimpy test subjects who didn't want plutonium injected into their veins.   Phase Two  (Optional) Tell everyone you know about your aspiration to become a nuclear power. Watch as the simple minded proles dismiss your ramblings and continue their meaningless, pathetic lives.   Phase Three  Gain access to a high grade uranium, the more the merrier ( that is, if you measure merriness by the amount of hair that falls out). A good spot to look for this is the neighborhood weapons research lab. There are several stratigies that can be employed to retrieve the said uranium. a) Get a younger brother of sister between the ages of 3 and 7, the years of peak cuteness. Use your adorable little munchkin friend to distract the guards whilst you covertly sneak 'round the back and pop a few rods of the weapons grade stuff into your jacket. b) Obtain a sharpened stick ( urlLink fig. 1 ) and, in a Ramboesque rage, storm the facility, shivving all that moves. Once in possession of the uranium, work your way back out and hold a last stand with your now dulled weapon. Just as you're about to make it out alive, you trip on your boot lace that became disheveled during the intense fighting and get hot uranium spilled all over your crotch (this stuff is worse than coffee).  Tune in next time for Part 2 of, "So You've Decided to Become a Nuclear Power."   "Politics is war without bloodshed while war is politics with bloodshed." Mao Tse-Tung

      As we speak, our comrade Ackmed is touring China. Let us wish him a safe journey and that he doesn't get expedited to a Chinese prison. Believe me, spending ten months in a Chinese cell for littering in Tiananmen Square isn't the best way to spend your spring break (not to mention summer break and winter break too). And no matter how slowly or loud you yell, "I AM AMERICAN," it just doesn't get to the guards. The billy clubs they carry hurt, especially if they stick a rusty nail through it.

      Today I watched Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11 , and although I don't want to sound snobbish, I am not amused. Well, actually I am amused. Some parts were entertaining, but overall, I found it to be an emotionally manipulative film that left out chunks from the big picture just so he could make his point. The movie was made more to fire up people who were already shared his opinions on Bush, Iraq, etc. than it was to convince those of opposing thought.  For example, images of Iraqi children playing, people eating at cafes, and a wedding (all pre-war) were shown as President Bush read a speech on the "threat" posed by Iraq. Then, in the next scene, footage of Bush talking about the justness of our cause was mixed with charred corpses of innocent children were being dumped into the back of a pickup truck as mothers wept and cursed the U.S. Another thing I disliked was how he speculated what George Bush was thinking as he was informed of the terrorist attacks on the morning of September 11, 2001. It was just slow-motion footage of Bush sitting in a chair while Moore made suggestions of what he thought was going through Bush's mind.  But the movie still had some parts I found entertaining. Upon his realization (and to his horror) that most legislators don't read the bills they vote for, Moore commandeers an ice cream truck and reads the Patriot Act on a loudspeaker as he drives through Washington D.C. I also think he had a point of how the post 9/11 "trust no one" and "constant vigilance"  mindset was exploited through scare tactics in order to pass the Patriot Act.  In the end, I think it is very unnecessary for someone to spend millions of dollars making a movie so that they can tell me that politicians have the capacity to lie.

      People these days. Them and their loud music, long hair and supposedly unalienable rights. What this nation needs is a good, swift kick in the arse, and I know just how to do it.  What we need is to do away with all of these unnecessary "rights" people think they deserve. Most of them hardly use or are even aware of them anyway. We'll start with that pesky 8th Amendment. Capital punishment for capital crimes I say. Heck, they don't even need to be capital crimes. Littering should be made punishable by public burning at the stake. That'll make the streets cleaner. Like Singapore. Why can't we all be like Singapore? It's so clean. And efficient.  See? Already things are better. Clean streets, more parking (no more need for street cleanings) and public executions to keep our nation's youth from staying in the house and rotting their brains on violent television. Hate those people who close the elevator on you? Well, that could be made punishable by being strapped into a chair and being forced to watch reruns of teletubbies for the rest of eternity. I'm not even breaking the current standing 8th Amendment  that  much. A punishment isn't unusual until after the first few hundred times, and cruel is a very subjective word.  Let's see, what other unneeded freedoms are just rotting away in the leaky corner of the basement? Let's toss out freedom of the press. They're doing a shoddy job of it anyway, that free press. Why just tonight, I was staring at the tele-you-what-to-do-a-ma-bob-vision when I saw "breaking news" on  Inside Edition  of VP nominee John Edward's son's thumb sucking problem. Egad. Or how about the constant gossipy prolefeed produced by supermarket checkout tabloids like  urlLink  The National Enquirer   or  urlLink  The Globe  . You see, people are idiots. You don't want  them  in control of what you think, do you? People who think they're happier because they are told so are happier. It's the great placebo. Why, just look at good 'ol North Korea. They may have hundreds of thousands of people starving per year, but they're starving with a  smile .  Slowly, we can phase out any and all forms of liberties and have a fully operational oppressive government up and running within the next 2-3 years. It is here where my point is made. Hey, we have a lot of freedom other people in the world don't. Use it well.  Perhaps we ought not go as far as to create a totalitarian regime every decade or so, but instead have an annual, two week-long "Totalitarian Fest" in which every citizen of the U.S. lives in a gulag type camp. Productivity of say, commerce may slow a bit for two weeks, but ditch digging will be at an all time high. All I ask is two weeks, the other fifty can be yours.   "Let them eat cake."
