                  Welcome to the SIFF History Site        Staten Island Fantasy Football        We will be using this site to store league details.  I'm going to try to re-post all the results from the past five years; but at a minimum everything will be stored from season IV and on!  Hope you enjoy!  On an on going basis, I will store draft orders, season standings, buy-in amounts and anything else that seems relevant.  If anybody has league information from previous years, please provide me with it, and I can fill in the holes...       I. League History :  Our original interest for fantasy football started back in Susan Wagner High School in the early 90's.  We held our yearly draft on Sunday mornings before the season...There were only six teams back then.  Everybody had a pretty good team!  We did everything on paper and waited for the Monday newspaper for the results.  That was back before the internet.  Now with the internet everything has become easier.        II. Season Overviews & Standings:   If you click on the season, you will get a season summary written by the Eric Diamant our   "Secretary Laureate & Directory of Propaganda"  .  Also, there are season champions, standings and other information about the seasons.  Starting with Season V, we will have the draft and money information about each year.           1.  urlLink SIFF Season One (1999)   2.  urlLink SIFF Season Two (2000)   3.  urlLink SIFF Season Three (2001)   4.  urlLink SIFF Season Four (2002)   5.  urlLink SIFF Season Five (2003)   6.  urlLink SIFF Season Six (2004)          III.

       urlLink    That's Tara's brother Kevin; we are playing croquet.  Did you know, that when you hit somebody's ball, you can put your foot on your ball and crush their ball as far as you can hit it....I missed out on this sport for 28 years.  I think they need to create some commercials and America would eat up this sport!
