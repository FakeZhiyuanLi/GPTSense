      	I have a pattern of faith lost and faith restored in humanity. I was sitting on a bench at an snacks booth at a park and thinking about who knows what, certainly nothing important. Those around me are not thinking of anything important either, because to think about, and say, something important would require a cease and desist order on humor, which we can't have. I don't think real conversation bares humor, but every time you make a crack in a serious conversation you can't seem to get back on topic. So I'm sitting here, and I begin to actually listen to what people are saying. Have you ever done this? It's where you stop thinking about what you are going to say next, or where you want to turn the stream of talk, and process the words that are issuing from another person's mouth. 	The topics are as follows: What I did today, what I did yesterday, what I plan to do tomorrow, what happened to me sometimes in the day a month ago, and what I like to do sometimes as a late night activity. You don't need specifics, but we could not get past talking about what we had done the day of, or the day directly adjacent to the day on which the conversation was taking place. 	Here is the pattern I see emerging. It starts with the initial fear of silence, a primordial emotion present in every one of the speakers. No one can think of anything to say, and you don't start with something deep; you build up to it, which is why starting with the weather has slowly risen to the status of cliché. Will somebody please congratulate it. 	But everybody listens to the first pointless comment, because if they don't, they will miss taking the seed of conversation and planting it in healthy soil. However, the comment is pointless, and has nowhere to go. For instance, "my toilet almost overflowed today. I think I flushed down way to much toilet paper, and it started swirling around and rising, and I was like, holy freak, it's coming out!" However, once this comment is finished with, another potential silence waits crouching at the edge of the conversation, and so someone drops another comment, much the same as the first. 	Repeat process. 	It's hard to follow this formula with just two people, because one of them usually starts to notice that these comments have no stream of consciousness, and so they feel hollow inside, because words have been passing into their ears but nothing has stuck yet, and how crappy is that to have happen? You want something real. You really do. 	So we finish at the snack place, and everyone splits up. Some have to go home, and some do not yet feel like going home. I, personally, had my interests in whether another person was staying or going, and so I chose indifferent. Realizing that we had lost pretty much all hope of a shallow conversation even, we turned immediately to a shallow activity. I wont go into details because it's pointless, and there's no story to it. 	I'm an introvert, in case you hadn't guessed. I came home at like 11:00 o'clock, which is a fairly early hour, I guess, but I was too exhausted to move. Not tired, but exhausted. I can come back from any activity that involves a lot of others, and come away with a desire to take up my own call of hermitage. I don't even want to go into it. I'm way too tired.

      	Have you ever felt like everyone is so busy thinking of something to say and something to do that no one ever actually says anything? I was sixteen when I realized that none of my friends had spoken to me in years. The troubling thing was, I had spoken to myself plenty of times, and they often say this is the first sign that you're losing it. 	Let me clarify here. My friends have been saying things nearly every time we meet, except when I meet a girl I like, in which case no one says anything. But we don't actually speak. We just talk. I went to the mall with a girl the other day, and asked her, because I was actually interested, not just because I wanted fodder for my conversational cannon, what she was interested in what her passions were. She told me that she played basketball, which I knew, and ran cross country, which I knew. I asked her again, with modified wording, what her passions were, but it went nowhere. 	Does this mean that she had no deep emotions, no deeper feeling than an abiding love for athletics? By no means, but it does mean that she has been programmed by modern society in the tradition and habit of avoiding actually saying anything. Words, words, and nothing else. 	So I'm driving along a windy road the other day, above a busy street, and I look over at an open patch of grass, and I suddenly realize that if two people walked up the slow slope of that hill and sat on that grass and overlooked the business district, they could have a real conversation. Since then this patch of grass has embodied all things meaningful and deep in a friendship, or possibly a relationship. 	The only thing is, I finally get the spunk and resolve to phone a girl up-I'm phone shy-and say, "Honey, let's go sit on a hill overlooking the business district", it's one in the morning and I tell myself I am temporarily insane. This is all part of a large, and sometimes unquieting game, namely, that when I wake up the following morning, my first thought is no longer a philosophical quandary about finding meaning in other people, but what cereal I am going to have for breakfast, and whether I should run before or after this cereal, weighing the heaviness of the milk against my hunger. 	So it comes and it goes, but I think I grow most when it comes, or rather, after it has arrived but before it has left, so that it is the current state of things. I suppose one solution is to artificially induce this mood all of the time, by reading classic works of literature, and having it be early morning all the time, but I can achieve neither of those, and want neither of them, so it seems that I am stuck in a state of fickality. A sore problem, is it not? 	Let me tell another quick story before I get to mine. I'm sitting next to this girl, and I haven't talked to her in a little more than a decade, but apparently we used to live near each other. I remember three things: Grilled cheese, a movie, and a short conversation with her mother. But I am optimistic. I can make a conversation out of this, because, after all, all humans share memory as a common thing, and events in the past take on a rather magical air after years have gone by. 	"I heard," I begin, "that you remembered me from some ten years ago." We moved past formalities. "I don't remember much." I recalled what I did, and ended, signaling that it was her shot as some semblance of conversation. She gets a quirky expression and says, "weird." 	I take two lessons from this. First, never expect things to start a real conversation. You have to take your words, and theirs, by the neck and steer them. Second, never try to start a conversation while waiting to go back into a fast moving dodgeball game.

      This blog is, currently, like a world of newfallen snow: there doesn't seem to be anything there. Well, that would be because this is the first post. You will see where this blog is going as soon as I begin to write.
