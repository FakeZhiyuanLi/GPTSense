      Regine Velasquez and Ogie Agasi  Bakit di magawang limutin ka  Bawat sandali'y ika'y naaalala  Tangi kong dasal sa Maykapal  Makapiling kang muli.   Bakit dika maalis sa isip ko  Ikaw ang laging laman nitong puso ko  Kahit pilitin kong damdamin magbago  Ikaw pa rin ang hinahanap ko   Refrain:   Hanggang ngayon,  Ikaw pa rin ang iniibig ko  Ikaw pa rin ang natatanging pangarap ko  Ikaw lamang  Hanggang ngayon   Ikaw lang ang tunay na minamahal  Ikaw lang hinihintay  ko ng kaytagal.   Ikaw ang ligaya,  Ang buhay at pag-asa  Ikaw lang, wala ng iba  kaya't   (Repeat Refrain)   Dapat ba nating pagbigyan  Ang ating mga puso ay muli pang buksan  At ibibigay ang lahat ang pag-ibig na tapat.  Sa iyo.  Sa iyo.   Hanggang ngayon,  Ikaw pa rin ang iniibig ko  Ikaw pa rin ang natatanging pangarap ko  Hindi ko na kayang mag-isa  Ikaw lamang,  Ikaw lamang,  Ikaw lamang,  Hanggang ngayon.

      Kyla   If ever you wondered  If you touch my soul  Yes u do  Since i met u  I'm not the same  you bring life to everything  I do  Just the way you say Hello  with one touch  I can't Let go  Never thought  I'd Fall in love with you   *Because of you  my life has change  Thank you for the love  And the joy you bring  Because of you  I feel no shame  I'll tell the world  It's because of you   Sometimes i get lonely  And all i gotta do is think of you  You captured something  Inside of me  You make all of my dreams come true  Its not enough that you love me for me  You reach inside and touch me eternally  I love you best explains how i feel for u   Repeat *   The magic in your eyes  True love i can't deny  When you hold me  I just lose control  I want you to know that  I'm never lettin'go  You mean so much to me  I want the world to see  It's because of you   Repeat*   My life has change thank you  For the love and the joy  You bring  Because of you i feel no shame  I'll tell the world it's because of you  Because of you...

      paolo santos  I look in your eyes and I can see  You've loved so dangerously  and you're not trusting your heart to anyone...  You tell me you're gonna play it smart  We're through before we start  But I believe that we've only just begun  When it's this good there's no saying no  I want you so I'm ready to go  Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall  For just to be with you I'd gladly risk it all  Through the fire, through the limit come what may  For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...  Right down to the wire, even through the fire  I know you're afraid of what you feel  Your still need time to heal  And I could help if you'll only let me try  You touched me and something in me knew  What I could have with you,  Now I'm not ready to say goodbye  When it's this good there's no saying no  I need you so I'm ready to go   Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall  For the chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all  Through the fire, to the limit come what may  For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...  Right down to the wire, even through the fire  Through the fire, to the limit, through the fire, even through fire

      Apo Hiking Society  There I was an empty piece of a shell,  Just mindin' my own world;  Without even knowin'  what love and life were all about.   Then you came,You brought me out of the shell; You gave the world to me  And before I knew,  There I was so in love with you.   Chorus:  You gave me a reason for my being  And I love what I'm feelin'  You gave me a meaning to my life,  Yes, I've gone beyond existing  And it all began when I met you.    I love the touch of your hair  And when I look in your eyesI just know,  I know I'm on to something good  And I'm sure my love for you will endure  Your love will light up my world;  And take all my cares away  with the aching part of me.   Chorus:  You gave me a reason for my being  And I love what I'm feelin'  You gave me a meaning to my life,  Yes, I've gone beyond existing  And it all began when I met you.   You taught me how to love,  You showed me how tomorrow and today  My life is diff'rent from the yesterday;  And you, you taught me how to love  And darling I will always cherish you  Today, tomorrow and forever.   And I'm sure when evening comes around  I know we'll be making love like never before;  My love, who could ask for more?   You gave me a reason for my being  And I love what I'm feelin'  You gave me a meaning to my life,  Yes, I've gone beyond existing  And it all began when I met you.  When I met you.   You gave me a reason for my being  And I love what I'm feelin'  You gave me a meaning to my life,  Yes, I've gone beyond existing  And it all began when I met you.  When I met you.
