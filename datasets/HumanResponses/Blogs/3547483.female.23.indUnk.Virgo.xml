      I cannot tell you how happy I am that my house smells like Clorox bleach.

      It's Sunday.  But, then again, you already knew that. I spent the evening cleaning out my fridge for, I swear, the last &*#@ing time.  Well, a little backstory:  Six months ago, I bought some celery and left it in the ol' crisper, which seemed like a good idea at the time.  Well, stuff got piled on top of it and I forgot about it for a few months.  During that time, the celery liquefied and became a gawdawful stew in the bottom of my crisper drawer which filled my fridge with a nasal-numbingly awful stench that seemed to defy the awesome cleaning powers of vinegar, Comet and baking soda.  Over the last couple of months, I've tried various attacks to free my fridge from the dark, evil, lurking dead soul of celery past - to no avail.  Today, I scrubbed down the sides of the fridge with bleach and have turned the fridge off and stored what little food I had in it in a small cooler.  During this process, I have learned that I have a small drinking problem.  The contents of my fridge were as follows:  1 bottle of mustard, 1 bottle of A1 sauce, 1 bottle of Japanese green tea, 2 bottles of salad dressing, 1 bottle of lemon juice, 1 bottle of soy sauce, 1 bottle of syrup, 2 bottles of cider, 2 bottles of vodka, 1 bottle of margaritas (pre-mixed), 2 bottled cocktails, 1 bottle of Skyy Cosmopolitan mix, 1 bottle of DuKuyper Apple Pucker, 1 bottle of DuKuyper Buttershots, 1 bottle of Guinness, 1 bottle of Malibu Rum and 1 bottle of Peach Schnapps.  This, of course, does not include the alcohol I have in storage in my freezer.  Sweet Jesus. Well, in any case, I hope that this cleaning effort works because it will be incredibly nice to tuck into a plate of scrambled eggs without them being seasoned with the piquant taste of 3 month old celery.  The parental units stopped by Casa de Outerlands for a Father's Day lunch.  Since, thanks to the fridge of death, I cannot cook, I took them out to T.G.I. Friday's where we had a nice slab of The Expected and went back to my place.  There, my stepmother was in a pissy mood about having to climb the 3 stories to my place - as if I have control.  She also seemed upset with the sword collection on my wall.  "Don't you have to have those registered as weapons?" she cooed.  Uh, no.  They are swords, not 9mms.  Come on.  Well, in short, they left after an hour.  Saturday was spent with a visit from my mother and stepfather.  We spent the early afternoon in Long Grove where we looked at stuff.  Then we went to Lalo's and had Mexican food.  Then we went home.  No, no, it wasn't as boring and crappy as it sounds.  It's just that my weekends have been so...mundane lately.  Blah.  I'm so not digging this scene.  So...the plan, ladies and gents, is for me to restart my excersize routine and get back to eating nicely instead of this crap I've been eating lately.  I have   gained a few more pounds and am pretty sick of it all.  That, friends, was the largest impetus behind me cleaning out my fridge:   the desire to look my damn sexiest in a black leather corset .  That...  Ah, yes,  that  is an admirable goal.

      I am, frankly, at a loss for words.  Which is not to say that I am  surprised  by any of this, I'm just sick of wasting my breath.  Anyway, the following is a letter Daj* forwarded on to me and it made my eyelid twitch.  I would have just typed the highlights, but that would have required me to think more about this $%@#!@* administration and I want my eyelid to stop twitching.  Well, um, "enjoy", but that's probably not the right word for it....  ******************************************  Subj:    Fwd: Highlight Cheney's Corruption -- Starting TOMORROW    Date:    6/14/2004 8:15:11 PM Eastern Daylight Time    From:    XXXXX    To:    XXXXXX, XXXXXXXXX     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Subj:    Highlight Cheney's Corruption -- Starting TOMORROW    Date:    6/14/2004 2:16:16 PM Eastern Daylight Time    From:    "XXXXXXXXXX"      To:    "XXXXXXXX"       Dear MoveOn member,  Just this morning, the L.A. Times released a new Halliburton bombshell: it's now clear that over the protests of an Army official, Vice President Cheney's office helped ensure that Cheney's old company Halliburton would receive a $7 billion no-bid contract for rebuilding Iraq.[1] Faced with a choice between serving our troops and helping out his corporate buddies, Cheney chose the latter.   The timing for our new ad exposing how Halliburton and Bush administration officials took taxpayers for a ride couldn’t be better. And starting tomorrow, Congress will be holding hearings on whether Halliburton used its close ties to administration officials to get sweetheart deals, shortchanging both our troops and U.S. taxpayers. Since Thursday afternoon, we've already raised about $420,000 to air the ad. But in order to get the ad in front of swing-state voters for a week starting tomorrow, we’ll need to raise about $1.1 million. Together, if we all pitch in what we can, we can make it happen.  Take a look at the finished ad and help get it on the air at:   urlLink https://www.moveonpac.org/donate/halliburton.html?id=2940-4122654-kl2i8M6O6CSxmrNpwy6Cmg   The list of governmental investigations against Halliburton just keeps on growing. Just last Friday, Halliburton disclosed yet another one -- the SEC is investigating one of its subsidiaries for foreign corruption. Halliburton's unethical behavior is in the news this week, and with your help we can get it in front of key voters in battleground states as well.  Thanks for all of your help. We've attached the original email on the ad – which has a lot more detail about Halliburton's shady deals with the Bush administration – below.  Sincerely,  --Eli Pariser   MoveOn PAC   June 14th, 2004  PAID FOR BY MoveOn PAC P.O. Box 9218, Berkeley, CA 94709  ----------------- Original Message re: Help Take On Halliburton June 10, 2004 -----------------  Dear MoveOn member,   There are lots of reasons that things are going south in Iraq. President Bush alienated the international community, lied to the world about the threat of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, failed to plan for reconstruction . . . and the list goes on. But there's another less talked-about reason that things are turning out so badly: President Bush and Vice President Cheney simply can't resist a chance to help their corporate friends make a buck, even when it undermines the troops.   Today, we're launching a new ad to call the Bush Administration on its ties to the scandal-plagued company Halliburton. In just a year in Iraq, Halliburton employees have accepted $6 million in illegal kickbacks (1), the company overcharged taxpayers millions for gas (2), and charged hundreds of millions of dollars for meals for our troops that were never delivered (3). It's a perfect example of how Bush and Cheney's taste for corporate cronyism has weakened our country and cost taxpayers billions.   We know from polling that for many people the Halliburton debacle illustrates a core weakness in the Bush program, and helps convince independent voters to vote against Bush. That's why it's so important that we get this ad, which hammers that point home, in front of as many people as possible. If we can raise $1.1 million, we can run the ad deep for a week in a number of the key "battleground" states. Please contribute what you can to help us get it on the air today at:    urlLink https://www.moveonpac.org/donate/halliburton.html?id=2940-4122654-kl2i8M6O6CSxmrNpwy6Cmg   On that page, you can also read a full script of the ad and take a look at the story boards.   Revelations regarding Halliburton's unethical and at times illegal behavior continue to pop up at a regular pace. But perhaps more worrisome are indications that the Bush administration isn't just turning a blind eye to Halliburton's corrupt business practices -- it's actively helping the company along. For example, Time Magazine exposed last week that newly disclosed internal Pentagon emails suggest that the office of Vice President Dick Cheney was instrumental in sealing an $18 BILLION no-bid contract for the Vice President's former company (4).   Nor does Halliburton's track record end at fraud. In a Pentagon audit, Halliburton was warned that its food service facilities which serve our troops in Iraq were dangerously unsanitary, with "blood all over the floor" of its kitchens, "dirty pans," and "rotting meats ... and vegetables." (5) As Representative Henry Waxman (D-CA) put it, Halliburton is ultimately "a company that arrogantly is overcharging when they can get away with it and not providing the quality of service that they agreed to do." (6)   Vice President Dick Cheney still holds hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of stock options in the company.(7) So it's hardly surprising that the Administration's response has been anemic, even when faced with clear evidence that the company is bilking taxpayers.   That's why we need to get this ad on the air. Can you contribute to make that happen?

      Well, I've spent the afternoon today doing close to nothing.  I just put a load of dishes in the dishwasher and am currently waiting for it to leak.  I've only asked my apartment management peeps twice to fix it, but the lazy, shiesty repairmen they have claim it "doesn't leak".  Apparently, the lake in my kitchen is only in my imagination.  The last guy who came to "fix" the problem used  half a roll of my paper towels  - and if it wasn't to mop up the water then what the freaking &#^@!?!  This is only  one  problem of many I have here in Forest Dwelling Apartments*, so I am dreaming of the wonders of home ownership.  So, yesterday I spent the entire afternoon at the  urlLink Chicago Botanic Garden  with my friend Seraph*.  We pretty much saw the whole place and got a good hike in.  It's a great month to go since a lot of plants are starting to bloom and everything has gotten pretty green.  One recommendation:  Bring your own water or soda - unless you like paying $1.75 for a can of soda or bottle of water.  There are water fountains a couple of places throughout the park so you can always refill your bottle there, if you like.  The shop they had there had some fantastic stuff, but expensive.  For example, I fell in love with a bar of soap - but was unwilling to part with $20 for it.  Same goes for the cafe - but I did manage to escape with an apple, a snack bar, a square of chocolate cake and a bottle of skim milk for about $6.  Well, okay, enough for the economics lesson.  We also visited the  urlLink Baha'i Temple .  The temple is simply stunning.  I really don't know how to describe the beauty and serenity of the place.  You will have to check out the link to see for yourself.  Seraph and I sat in side for about 15 minutes and had some nice time for quiet contemplation before setting of home.  During all of this, we had to drive through  urlLink Kenilworth ,  urlLink Glencoe ,  urlLink Wilmette  and  urlLink Highland Park  whose houses are, to say the least, stunning.  I have never seen so many multi-million dollar mansions concentrated in one area.  It's nothing but huge estates all the way up the north shore from Chicago to the Botanic Garden, so the drive is pretty interesting.  Well, actually, it's pretty sickening, to be honest.  *All names in my blog have been changed to protect the not-so-innocent.

      Well...  This is my first posting.  Very exciting, so far.  (Sarcasm, served dry here.)  It's Friday.  So, I'm feeling Friday-ish.  My plan is to spend the night putting together my webpage (yet to be uploaded) and at least find some webspace for it.  ::sigh::  Though, I'll probably just end up drinking and watching MST3K or something.  Like that's such a  bad  thing.    I HATE MY JOB    I'm sorry...  I just felt the need to shout that out.  I mean, this administrative bull$%&# just isn't the glamourous dream job I had imagined it to be.  I sat at my desk today for about an hour and a half, pretending to work.  Conversely, I spent all of last week working 12 hour days, praying to a benevelent god to let me go home on time one night.  Nothing much to report on, really.  I'm way too braindead to really go on much here.
