      So I just found out that I got a free flight on Southwest!  I think it can be redeemed at any time, so I can decide to go somewhere last minute (probably DC to SF I suspect).  I love Southwest...  Speaking of flying, Danny and I leave tomorrow for Chicago, where we're going to a wedding in Milwaukee on Saturday.  We get in Friday night, with plenty of time to go to Roscoe's for vodka lemonades.  We're staying in the Palmer House on Friday, which should be very nice.  I love that hotel.    And now, it's time to edit this damn opinion.  I'm so sick of it, I can't wait to start working on something else...

      After getting the wrong book for the South Beach Diet (grr), I went over to Fenwick to join Danny, Shuster, and Hulse for drinks in Danny's office.  (It scares me a little that Michael has vodka hanging out in his office, but that's another matter).  After Tina joined us, we went over to Merenda (and met Yaron and Ken) for the final event in Danny's 30th Birthday Extravaganza.  The dinner was decent for the most part - I had a raw salmon and greens salad, homemade spaghetti (which was great), lamb (which was decent - a bit overcooked) and a fabulous chocolate cake for desert.  Danny's steak, however, was inedible - it was pure grizzle and fat.  I won't go back to that restaurant, and for anyone thinking about it, for the price you can get a much better meal elsewhere in the city.  But, all that being said, it was very nice to hang out with everyone and celebrate Danny's 30th, which he's taking rather well (as he should).  Happy Birthday, baby!

      Some  urlLink interesting remarks  on our current foreign "policy" by our former VP.  Long, but interesting.  I wish Kerry could come out and say something this forceful.  (NB: I haven't read it all yet, so not sure I agree with it - it'll be muni reading)

      The Ninth Circuit today  urlLink  struck down  a directive issued by Ashcroft barring physicians in Oregon from implementing the physician assisted suicide law on pain of losing their licenses to prescribe drugs.  Basically, the Court concluded that since this was the regulation of the doctor-patient relationship, something ordinarily entrusted to the states, it was at the outer edge of Congress's powers.  Therefore, the Court applied the "clear statement rule" which requires Congress to be clear when it is butting up against the edge of its constitutional authority.  Here, however, the Controlled Substances Act ("CSA") provides no such clear statement, and indeed, strongly suggests the AG has no authority to issue such a directive.  The main sticking point is that the statute requires the AG to first look to the state disciplinary board when deciding whether to revoke someone's license, which he clearly isn't doing here.  There are some other factors he clearly ignored when issuing this blanket directive.  It's a long opinion (58 pages including a dissent) but well worth a quick skim at a minimum.

      So I'm thinking of going on the south beach diet.  It looks a bit more sane than Atkins - from what I can tell, you can't eat all the fat you want, and the no-carb thing is only for two weeks to get over your carb cravings, which I definitely need to do.  At a minimum, I'm going to buy the book and read it - I suspect even if I don't do the diet, I'll still get alot out of reading the book.  I've definitely fallen off the wagon, and it's time to climb back on.

      Well, we started the party for Danny's 30th a bit early last night.  What was supposed to be "a quick drink because I [Danny] have to get up at 6:30 am for a meeting" turned into a few at badlands, a few at Detour (including three shots), a few pool games, and then champagne at Danny's.  Oof.  I'm surprisingly ok today, although a bit dehydrated.  It's 10:15 a.m. and I'm just getting into work.  I'm going to finish these opinions how exactly?

      Interesting article on Bush's speech last night:  urlLink Magical History Tour by William Saletan .  I still don't understand what the Republicans like about this guy except that he's not a Democrat.  His five points to guide our Iraq policy were completely empty - they're good headings for an argument, but there is no argument there.  I have a feeling there is going to be a real mess when we wake up the morning of July 1...

      I'm now in work - and surprise surprise, the judge fedexed two opinions from France for me to work on.  That wasn't exactly in my calculations for what I need to do work-wise.  It'll all get done, I suppose. I just may be taking some work with me to Chicago and D.C.   Here is a brief recap of Vegas.  We arrived on Friday morning, and after renting a car from National (never again), we  drove with Danny's friends Bill and Todd to the  urlLink Hoover Dam .  It was very cool - so big, so much concrete - and so much water missing.  You could see from the limestone deposits how much water has been lost lately.  It reminded me of a NYT article (May 2, 2004: Drought Settles In, Lake Shrinks and West's Worries Grow by K. Johnson and D.E. Murphy) that argued that the drought in the West is not an abberation.  Let's hope they are wrong; otherwise Lake Powell is due to be empty by 2007!  Very scary.  Makes you want to take down all the golf courses out here...  We then drove back and tried to check into our hotel room at the  urlLink Paris Hotel .  We discovered that they did not have the setup we paid for (a suite attached to a room with two queen sized beds).  I won't go into the bitter details, but suffice it to say that there was no such configuration in the entire hotel, and after much time and effort, they gave us a much larger suite and a room with two queen sized beds down the hall.  Although that was less than ideal (and dampered our moods), the suite itself ($1800/night normally) was gorgeous - a living area with a couch, armchairs and a large coffee table; dining table; bar area; two bathrooms; jacuzzi, etc.  It was fabulous.  We took a break and grabbed a bite at a Deli in the Forum Shops, where we met Danny's long-lost cousin Adam.  Adam was very sweet and very, very, hyper - he talked a mile a minute.  Although I chalked that up to him being excited to see Danny, I figured out over the rest of the weekend that the boy is constantly full of energy - which was nice, as it helped to energize us as well.    We then went to see the  urlLink Blue Man Group .  they were really good, although the show was the same as I saw in Chicago; fortunately, it was new for the Birthday Boy, so all was well.  This was followed by a nice dinner at a Chinese restaurant in  urlLink Mandalay Bay  that was attended by me, Danny, Michael, Richard, Bill, Todd, and a late-arriving Patricio.  We tried to go out gambling afterwards, but everyone was too tired as we had for the most part been travelling all day.  We then crashed, and geared up for the next day...  On Saturday, we got somewhat of a late start, and had the buffet in the Paris Hotel after playing some craps in Bally's with Yaron and Brian.  We all met at the Hilton for the  urlLink Star Trek Experience .  It was a little hokey, but definitely fun.  I got my picture taken with a Klingon, and it was cool to see the timelines, props, and such.  The new Borg 4-D ride wasn't as good as the older Klingon one, but they were both entertaining.  We then walked to the  urlLink Stratosphere  which has a 108 story tower in which you can see all of the Strip and the surrounding area, which was very cool.  We went on two  urlLink rides  there, the Big Shot and the X-Scream.  (See movies at website).  The Big Shot was awesome - it shot you up in the air, and then you got to free-fall for a few seconds.  I wasn't such a fan of X-Scream; my fear of heights got in the way.  Danny, of course, thought it was "boring."  After a few drinks in the bar while watching a beautiful sunset over Vegas, we went back to the suite where we all drank some cocktails and wine, and got ready for the big birthday dinner at  urlLink Mon Ami Gabi  a really nice steakhouse in the Paris.  We got our own room for the 10 of us, and the dinner and conversation were very nice - and surprisingly, not too pricey.  I'd recommend the restaurant if anyone goes to Vegas.  We then had a brief trip to only Gay Club in Vegas, Gipsy.  Again, however, we were all tired and so made a fairly early night of it.   On Sunday, Danny couldn't sleep, and so he and I woke up at 6:30 a.m.  We went over to the  urlLink Flamingo , where were staying that night, and had some coffee and watched the African penguins, flamingos, swans, and other assorted birds.  We played some more craps and some video blackjack at the  urlLink Bellagio , and walked around their beautiful flower garden.  It was so nice and peaceful there early on a Sunday morning; you almost forgot it was Vegas.  After checking out of the Paris and checking into the Flamingo, Danny and I had our first-ever massage at the Paris Salon.  It was very nice - very professional, nice soothing music, and the massage was great.  Both of us were a bit nervous as it was our first time getting a massage, but the women who did it were very nice.  I haven't felt that relaxed in a long time.  After the massage, we met up with Michael, Richard, and Adam, and went to the  urlLink Aladdin  where we tried to win a Mini and a BWM, but to no avail.  We then sat by the pool at the Flamingo until dinner.  Dinner was at Hamburger Mary's, and we met Danny's childhood friend Steve, Steve's mom Julia (who was very nice) and another of their friends from Winnipeg.  After dinner (at which there was this  awful  lounge singer, we went to the Cirque du Soleil show  urlLink Mystere .  Unfortunately, do to our early rising at 6:30 a.m., Danny and I were both exhausted, and could barely stay awake through the show.  From what I could remember, most of it was impressive, although it had this awful character who was kind of the funny ringmaster - except he wasn't too funny (I generally took naps during his parts).  I may have appreciated it if I were more awake.  After that, we hung out with Adam briefly, and went to bed.  Monday was our last day in Vegas.  We woke up, had breakfast, checked out, and then went to play Craps at the Paris.  Danny and I both had good luck, and won a fair amount, usually by betting against the shooter.  After cashing out (and playing some slots), we went to ride the roller coaster at  urlLink New York,N New York .  Surprisingly, it was a real roller coaster, and quite good, although a bit shakey.  After eating hot dogs and ice cream, we played air hockey at the arcade, as well as this bowling game in which you have to navigate your ball through the streets of San Francisco, around street cars, and up hills to hit the balls.  All of us got really into it, and it turned out to be a fun game.  Although I managed to bruise my thumb in the process, I beat out Danny to win, with 191 points. (That'll show you, buddy).  After a sad goodbye (with about 10 hugs each from Adam) we flew home - all in all, a nice trip.  Pictures will be posted on snapfish soon, I'm told.

      Interesting  urlLink article  on  urlLink Slate  about gay marriage.  Basically, it's a response to the traditional slippery slope argument that once we have gay marriage, we have to legalize bestiality.  I suspect the same arguments were made in response to legalizing interracial marriages, but I haven't seen any man-dog marriages as of late.  Hopefully, everyone will notice that the world hasn't come to an end even though the queers are getting married in Mass.  I also noted that Bush spoke again about the need for the federal marriage amendment.  I'm grateful that this thing doesn't have a shot of passing (at least in this term), and hopefully it won't come back: I suspect Bush doesn't really care about it, and so won't push it once he's reelected, and if Kerry is, we know he'll fight against it.  Still, I don't understand why my gay republican friends want to put someone in office who has spoken in favor of it.  But, what do I know?

      Today has been a complete waste.  I'm slightly hungover, thanks to going out with Danny last night to celebrate his finishing his biology class.  But, the Judge left for France today, so everyone is kind of not working.  Unfortunately, I have few days remaining, so I need to kick it in gear.  Maybe next week.  Tomorrow we leave for Vegas (Vegas, baby, Vegas!) where we'll be celebrating Danny's 30th birthday.  We're taking a tour of the  urlLink Hoover Dam  on Friday, and then Friday night we're going to see the  urlLink Blue Man Group .  Several of us (me, Danny, Yaron, Bill, John, and maybe Patricio) are staying in a suite in the  urlLink Paris  which should be "very nice." Other than that, it's going to be sitting by the pool, going to the local gay club (Gypsie).  It's going to be a blast.  Now let's see if I can get any work done...

      So on June 8, I turned 26 years old.  Contrary to the views of some, this means I am decidedly still in my mid-20s.  I really enjoyed the age of 25 - for me, it meant I was really an adult, but still young enough to be silly and have fun.  I guess the same is true of 26, although a bit more adult and a bit less fun. :)  The actual day was very nice.  My parents sent me a bouquet of 15 sunflowers, and Uyen made me a South-Beach friendly key lime cheesecake, which although very rich, was very yummy.  After work, I took the new bullet train down to Moutain View to meet Danny, Michael, Richard, Yaron, and Ken for dinner before seeing MADONNA!  (See review  urlLink  here .  She was absolutely fantastic - the dancing, the sets, the costumes, the music, all of it was fantastic.  I had been warned about (a) the political nature of the show; (b) Madonna can't sing; and (c) she didn't perform any of her old stuff.  None of it turned out to be true.  American Life was the only political song, and it was non-partisan - although maybe I was not upset because I somewhat agree with it.  Her singing was also quite good, and she did some neat things with familiar songs, particularly with the temp.  All in all, great show.  I then went to Danny's office where I got my birthday present - a  laptop!   I couldn't believe it.  I've been having some issues with mine, so this comes at an opportune time, but still - he's nuts!  It's a Dell, which is what I have now - and although he claims it isn't souped up, it's 10X better than what I have now.  I, of course, was so excited that I had to go out and buy a new bag for it (which I had been planning on doing for the old one anyway) as well as other accessories. :)  It'll be nice to have it when I work in DC.  In other technology news, Laura gave me a  urlLink Gmail  account, which is very cool.  1 gig of storage space - it's awesome!!!

      I'm doing "ok" on the diet thus far - as I said, I slipped up on Friday, and a little on Saturday, but Sunday was a good day.  I think I'm going to just go to Phase II and be done with it - I've lost 5 lbs. thus far, which is pretty good.  In an ideal world, I'd be able to do Phrase I for three weeks, but my lifestyle is such that occasionally, I have no choice but to eat some carbs.  And I really miss fruit...

      This weekend, was unfortunatly, dominated by work.  I'm trying to get everything done before I leave for D.C. (9 a.m., June 30th) - I have two benchmemos and two opinions to write between now and then (one opinion already mostly written).  It's not looking good.  Poor Katherine might have more to write than I had hoped...  Friday I had dinner with Danny at the Hulses - they made a fabulous steak, and there were plenty of cosmos to go around (needless to say, I disregarded my diet for a day).  Danny spent some time with his ex, Michael (it was the first time they had really done so since they broke up, so that was good), while I entertained Danny's british friend at Metro.  Yaron, Michael, and Danny then joined us, and we shut down the place.    Saturday, after an expensive haircut in which he barely cut anything, I was dragged to a high school dance performance .  That's right.  High School.  Don't ask.  Needless to say, it was painful, and I'll never regain that two hours of my life.  C'est la vie.  We then went to work until 11, and then went home and watched the Matrix III before bed.  Fortunately, I had such low expectations of the movie that it wasn't as bad as I had feared.  That being said, it really sucked.  Sunday was work, work, work, followed by dinner with my sister for her birthday.  After buying her a drink (now I can!) I went home to read some cases and watch a bit of TV before bed.  Laura came home after studying all day, and as she sat down, fell into the huge plate glass window beind her, breaking it.  She was fortunately ok, but I'm not looking forward to seeing how much the window costs.  I think I may get renter's insurance in D.C. next year...

      I think this  urlLink article  illustrates just how far we've come, although unfortunately I think it's wishful thinking on the part of the court.  It is the case that it shouldn't be bad to be called gay - much like it'd be hard to state a claim for libel if you were reported to have black hair instead of brown.  For some people, however, it unfortunately still is somethign that would result in harm to their character, but I think there is something nice about courts having a blind eye to that; to do otherwise would almost countenance the view that gay is synonymous with bad (or, if you're Sen. Santorum, a pedophile, adulterer, etc.).  My favorite quote:  "There may have been better terms for Albright, far more accurate than 'gay,'" wrote a columnist in Boston's The Enterprise. "That isn't a word we would use for someone who dated a woman and then turned around and sold personal information to the media. 'Cad,' perhaps, or maybe 'weasel.' But gay? He hardly seems deserving of the term."

      So I started my south beach diet yesterday.  Although I don't have all that much weight to lose (maybe 15 lbs), I decided I needed something to jump start me again, as I had started putting on weight from law school that I had lost.  Right now I'm in the "induction" phase, meaning that I can't have any carbs (outside of vegetables) for two weeks.  That includes all bread, pasta, potatoes - and alcohol!  I'm actually really excited about the detox, both from food, coffee, alcohol, etc.    Unfortunately, it's also very time intensive.  I spent $150 at the grocery store yesterday, and three hours cooking (although I made breakfast for the week, dinner for two nights, and dinner).  Yesterday for lunch I had a greek salad with chicken, for dinner grilled salmon with a salad, and a ricotta cheese dessert.  Today, I had a quiche for breakfast, grilled chiken salad for lunch, and I'll have leftover salmon for dinner.  There are snacks in between meals, which I like - so hopefully I can keep on this for awhile.  I'll give regular updates as to my weight - as of this morning, it was 154.4.  Wish me luck!

      This weekend I went to the (very rainy) midwest with Danny.  One of his law school friends was getting married in Milwaukee, but rather than fly in and out of there, we flew to Chicago and drove to the wedding, spending Friday and Sunday in Chicago and Saturday in Milwaukee.  When we got it, we met up with Arash, one of Danny's close friends from law school.  After dinner with some of his friends, we went to Roscoe's for their fabulous $10 pitchers of vodka lemonade.  We hung out there for awhile, and upon closing Danny wanted to go out for more, so we headed to Charlie's, which is open until 4.  (It's amazing: I lived there less than a year ago and I couldn't find Charlie's!)  We had a great time dancing, especially with this very attractive guy who, as is custom in Charlie's, lacked a shirt.  We eventually made it back to the room at 4 a.m. or so, got four hours of sleep, and then got up to drive to Mikwaukee.  The drive was fairly uneventful, although we were really pushing it on time so it was a bit stressful.  Fortunately, we made it with plenty of time.  The wedding was very nice - bride seemed very happy, as did the parents and friends, so that's a good sign.  After a brief pre-reception party at a local pub, we went over to the reception, which was also nice.  However, it was the post-reception part where things got interesting.    Danny's friend John wanted to go to a gay club where there were dancers.  None of us knew Milwaukee, so I called my friend Joe to ask if he could find something on the internet.  He pointed us to C'est la vie.  We get there, pay our $4 cover (which includes a drink) and discover that there is not a single person in the bar under 50.  The "dancers" were in fact drag queens - many of whom had been doing this for many, many years, and were clearly bored by the whole affair.  Combine that with the fact that the CD player kept skipping and the drag queens screaming at the lesbian running the thing, and you have one of the campiest bars I've ever been to.  It was awesome.  We then left for a club where they actually had dancers which was a few doors down.  It was also kind of seedy, but we had fun talking to the bartender and interrogating a dancer for half an hour.  We then called it a night - again, around 3 a.m. - so we could make it to brunch at the hotel the next morning.  We did in fact make it to brunch, and after saying goodbye to all of Danny's friends (who were all very sweet) we hit the road again.  We made an emergency stop at an A&W, where Arash wanted to buy some cheese curds.  They tasted good, but apparently didn't sit right with me.  About 15 min. from Chicago, I got very carsick very quickly.  Let's just say that the cheese curds are now on the side of the road.  (It was so weird, I've never had that happen so suddenly).  We then checked into the hotel and did a little shopping at Filene's Basement (a bargain discount store sort of like Marshalls).  Afterwards, we had dinner at  urlLink Hugo's Frog Bar , a steakhouse in Chicago.  We met up with my friend Jay from law school, and had a really nice dinner.  We then went to a bar around the corner and were joined by Andy, another U of C alum.  It was great having them meet Danny, and everyone seemed to like each other, which was even better.  We left a bit early as we had an insanely early flight to SFO, which we  barely  made.    All in all a very good weekend. :)

      (Note: this is likely to be more of personal day to day activities for awhile.  Internet is sporatic so I'm not reading all of these articles, and certain people in SF may want to know what I've been doing...)  So it's been awhile since I've updated the blog, but I've been busy.  Long story short, I'm now sitting in a starbucks in Dupont Circle - I'm finally in DC!  It was very hard to leave SF behind - Danny and I had a GREAT day at the zoo, and petted some alpacas, goats, and saw many other fun animals.  After moving the last of my stuff, we had a WONDERFUL dinner at this fancy seafood restaurant whose name escapes me (Danny, help me with this so I can edit it in!).  I'm sure the price was equally wonderful, but it was very romantic, and very good.  Afterwards, I went to Metro to say goodbye to my friends, and had a great turnout.  KHo even made me a sash that said Madame Justice.  It was hysterical.  It was a lot harder leaving Danny at the airport than either of us thought - but given that he just found his free ticket on American, maybe I'll be seeing him soon.  (hint, hint).  Got into DC last night, and after a hellish ride on the supershuttle (I know, I swore never again, but I had a lot of luggage) I got to my apartment.  The furniture is great, thanks to Jeff (and Jake for helping him move it in) so the apartment is in great shape.  Had dinner with Rokus, and then unpacked my suitcase, and read a bit more before going to bed.  Today, I woke up at 6:30 am b/c there was a loud pinging coming from the air conditioner.  I roamed around Cap. Hill looking for a starbucks so I could hook up to the internet, but to no avail.  So, I came to dupont circle, knowing there was one here.  Now that I know where all the various starbucks, CVSs, Citibanks, grocery stores, and dry cleaners are int he area, I'm set.  The rest of the day will likely be errands, especially a trip to bed, bath, and beyond in pentagon city.  It sucks not having a car when moving in, but I have plenty of time, and a magazine to read, so it shouldn't be too bad.  Nick wants to go to Remington's tonight, but I also promised the boys (as Jay, Jeff, Jake and Andy will be known hereafter) some drinks, so we will see.
