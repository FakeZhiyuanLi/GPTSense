      The Seventh Wave By Brian The Demolition Man Little Written 1998  The seventh wave is&nbsp;strongly approaching us As we moved closer today.  Our hearts cried all day to be together And we knew that we needed each other Because we love each other.  The seventh wave touched us as we hugged Trapped us in like prey as our lips touched each other And blazed though us like wildfire as we looked into each others eyes.  Our hearts healed us as we realized our destinies And that we are meant to be together forever.  The seventh wave is love, The love that will belong to us forever.

      Perfect Life By Brian The Demolition Man Little Written Spring 1996 - Courtesy The Spectrum  I'm a rose in the garden of life Young and healthy Wanting attention and love But being left out Only because I'm a rose.  A bee came up to me one day And asked for some nectar From my dying body And promised to help me And I said it was okay But the bee never helped me.  Now I'm almost dead My body is weakening and decaying Of loneliness and unhappiness But when I'm in heaven I won't be forgotten.

      Splinter By Brian The Demolition Man Little Written Late 2000  When you look into my eyes Do you see the splinter of my past Haunting out into your soul Or do you just seem emptiness Like the rest of the world does?  Have you ever been put in the place When someone broke you down And you tried to get up from the ground Yet the force of what that person left Left you too tired to keep trying?  I keep trying every day To see beyond what she left But all I get in return Is an empty life And no sign of a love.  We all tell ourselves There is someone for us Some find and some don't After the pain she has left me I doubt I have the strength To look again.....

      Why Wouldn't I Love You By Brian The Demolition Man Little First Half Written 1997, Second Half Written Tonight  You came to me one day And admitted something to me I found it strange you said this Because I didn't expect it.  But how can I return it When I am in a state of shock?  Why wouldn't I love you when you love me?  I ask myself this as I walk alone tonight Looking at the stars and the moon Then I look down at the ground And see two stones on the pavement.  Things became clear to me, My heart believes in love And that love is for you.  Why wouldn't I love you when you love me?  (To Angela)

      The World Before The World By Brian The Demolition Man Little Written Tonight  Moonlight and sunlight It all comes together In one blinding light Under a starfire of chaos Burning in a circle of fire High above the endless ocean Where the sea monster roams For millions and millions of years Right before the last tidalwave Crashes upon the rocks upon the shore Where the people lie about Running in a circle of winter When the blowing winds sends those out Now its a cold cold world In one blinding light It all comes together Moonlight and sunlight.

      Untitled Poem #1 By Brian The Demolition Man Little Presumed From Early 2001  It just pains me in my heart To see you walk away And into the arms of another But what am I supposed to do You just seem to ignore my cries I still feel for you in my heart Yet you seem to ignore that Your intent is only on seeing me fail Yet I tried to help you over your pain.  Why don't you see my pain Bleed into a river of sorrow Instead all you see is a victory Of breaking me down into insanity Then parading with my heart Only to splatter it upon the world I once loved you.  I must let go now I must survive Yet how can I do that Without you in my heart.  ----  When I wrote this I was mourning over the loss of a woman who at the time I thought I loved. Little did I realize that she used me so badly that I became too blind to her games. Looking back upon the words I wrote back then and the path I have gone on since then, I realize one of the biggest mistakes I made was trusting her. So to Jessie, I hope you are happy with how you hurt me. Because the pain you gave me has only made me stronger now. While I might forgive you one day for what you did, I will never forget. Never. I can promise you that.

      Its All Your Fault By Brian The Demolition Man Little Rough Draft, Unknown Presumed From 2001  Its all your fault why you left me You can't blame me for your decision Because I am not to blame here.  Its all your fault why you dumped me You say you still love me and care However I am not to believe that You then tell others you are mad at me But when I ask You just tell me nothing.  Its all your fault why I'm putting you behind You tell me I have an interest in another girl Which was never true (so ha ha) She now knows bout what you said And even if I did have an interest in her To hell I will never tell you now Because its none of your concern.  Just remember many years from now Its all your fault when I am long gone And you are all alone in your life.
