      Yessa! gig over. stress over. my tired also over2 sia. today was the big day. GIG DAY! woke up around 11, took a bath, watched some soccer, ate and siap2 for gig. went to syed's house for the boots, then took 65 to planet paradigm. met jun and achit at doby ghaut mrt. met mithun at planet paradigm itself. wen we arrived, there was only TERMINAL CRY and CYNICAL ANNIHILATION. sound check was suppose to be at 2, but it ended up at 4, bcoz of a power trip or sum shit. our sound check sucked, well at least it sucked for me. i cud not fucking hear wat the hell was i playing! then, wen it was over, the feedback was that my soung was too raw. LIKE A GARAGE SOUND! wtf??!! aaaaaaaaah. damn it. i was kanchong like shit sia my sound like fuck. wen TERMINAL CRY started playing, the crowd started to gather themselves in front. they wanted to hear MASQUERADE, but they kept it till the last. they also covered METALLICA'S CREEPING DEATH, with their own female vox style. up next was ANGEL OF SIN. that was wen i started shivering like shit. my heart was beating fucking fast. i had to sit down alone to recover my thoughts sia. they were not that tight, especially the drummer, whose double pedals weren't constant. their guitarist had some problems as in the middle of their set, he's sound disappeared sumhow.that really made me scared like shit. wat if it happens to me? like stupid sia i will be. then, we were next. ah fuck it. we took our gears n went up stage, with illnath's song being played in the background. i setup my gear, n then, sumting bad happened. NO SOUND! NO FUCKING SOUND! the metalzone wasn't lighted up. i juz fucking changed the batteries in the morning sia. the soundman helped me a bit, n luckily got sound. n sumhow, dis time my sound was sumwat balanced with syed's! yeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!! we started playing, n the crowd began headbang along with us! yeah! here's the setlist:  1) INTRO 2) DIMENSION ZERO - YOUR DARKEST HOUR 3) IN FLAMES - JESTER RACE 4) DEAD ETERNITY - AN EMPIRE FALLEN 5) DARK TRANQUILLITY - WHEN THE SUN FIRED BLANKS 6) DEAD ETERNITY - TRACK 2 7) IN FLAMES - JOTUN  im happy to say that everyting went well. settled our tix, took some band photos and blast e sound photos, n we went home. ah tired. very tired. exhausted.......

      Just got back from jamming n im tired. what a day it was. woke up around 12, took a bath listened to some blind guardian, n siap2 to go prayers. met frens there, then went to have some ice kachang. MMMMMMMM, YUMMY! then went to take my guitar n to syed's house, together with hafiz. lepak2 at his house, practiced sum shit, watched hafiz play xbox, i watched some hilariously sickening happytreefriends episode. sniffles is dumb man. wakuakuakua. then went home to get ready for madrasah, or was i? haha. cabot madrasah so tat can go jamming. it was a crucial session as the gig is juz one day away n we needed the practice. n im happy to say that everything went well. well, it was more than well. it was EXCELLENT! haha. my guitar sound n syed's one was finally balanced. jun did good in bass. achit was also excellent, except for some minor errors, especially for 'track 2' . other than that, we were ok. mithun had a throat infection, so he did not strain himself too much. saw YAKAMASHII jammed, albeit without their 2nd guitarist. they were good. damn good. FDM was also at I.J. they were mixing thier songs or sumting. man they r fucking hot. wohooooo! im now quite satisfied with DEAD ETERNITY. there's still room for improvement, especially our originals, which we are gonna practice again tomorrow. hopefully we will have a smooth set on the gig. weeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!
