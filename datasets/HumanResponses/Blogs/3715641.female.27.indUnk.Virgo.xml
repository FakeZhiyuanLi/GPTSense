      God I hate Michael Moore! How can any one person be so arrogant and so naive at the same time??? On the other hand, he has a gift for manipulating and twisting facts. I'm sure that's how he's come this far. His gift must be honed though. If he really wanted to consider himself a master, he'd be able to do it without anyone being the wiser. Right now, he's just some ultra left-wing animal spewing his anti-Bush religion to anyone and everyone that will entertain him with their ear for more than 2.5 seconds.  Enough of that.  Have you ever heard of the 24,000 cycle of man? It's been called a million different names and is followed quite avidly in the Hindu religion. I don't subscribe to any religion, and I am equally interested in the science of it as the spirit of it, but it basically goes like this.  Precession: the phenomenon whereby the Sun on the day of the equinox (that day when the day and night are of equal length) rises in different constellations, changing by about 50 arc seconds per year.*  Essentially, what that translates to is that about every 2,000 years or so, our sun rises in a different constellation. It has been in Pisces for about the last 2,000 years, and is now on the verge of changing to Aquarius (brings new meaning to the song "The Dawning of the Age of Aquarius" when you know more about what they're singing about, right). From Aquarius it will go to Capricorn and work it's way through the "signs".  I know, so far this has been rather dry. Here's the exciting part: every thing in life goes through cycles. In spring, life begins, sprouts flowers, births new creatures, etc. Summer they mature and prepare to die. Autumn they die, and winter they hibernate and prepare to do it all over again. The theory behind the 24,000 year cycle is that man is going through this same cycle on a very grand scale. Starting with the Golden Age, we cycle through the Silver, Bronze, and Iron Ages before cycling back up through the Bronze and Silver Ages back to Golden.  According to historians and scientists, we are now located somewhere past the Iron Age and in the beginning of the Bronze age on our way back up through the cycle. This is what keeps me going when my thoughts take me to places that I certainly don't want to be.  Through all of the terror, horror, and maladies that we've experienced in the last few centuries, we're on our way up. As a race, we've seen amazing things done in the last few millenia (pyramids, stone henge, sphinx) that still aren't fully explained--because we can't comprehend them yet. We lost knowledge (anyone remember the "world is flat" theory) and are slowly regaining it. If we can come this far and we still have another 16,000 years to go before we start "getting dumb" again, just imagine how amazing life will be for our future generations.  I am no longer worried about our children, apparently we've been through this before, and will be through this again. It is the natural progression of things as it seems. Please read more on this topic  urlLink  in a wonderful essay written by Walter Cruttenden.   He explains it much better than I ever could.  *"Precession of the Equinox: The Ancient Truth Behind Celestial Motion" by Walter Cruttenden.

      Common sense tells us that we will not always get along.  Common sense tells us that no matter what our good intentions, someone will always get the short end of the stick.  Common sense tells me that no matter how my heart bleeds for the injustices that happen in this world, every day I must wake up, brush my teeth, get dressed, and live my life.  Common sense tells me that one day, this privilege will no longer exist for me. That scares the hell out of me.  While we're talking about what scares the hell out of me...  It scares me that you can have two people that have never met each other, have no mutual friends, don't even live in the same hemisphere, yet they can hate each other with such passion that it destroys their entire lives.  It scares me that two people can worship the same god, but because they worship him differently, they must hate each other. Hate each other so much in fact that they feel they must kill each other.  It scares me that no one will acknowledge the fact that pride-not money-is the root of all evil, and is responsible for every war, every altercation, every terrorist attack that our poor planet has endured.  And now for everyone's favorite blogging topic...(you know you saw this coming)...Iraq.  Let me put this out on the table right now--I am not anti-war. I wish there were a better way to stunt evil, but until we figure it out, we don't have many alternatives.  Having said that, let me get to my real point. The war in Iraq is not as successful as the Bush administration planned for one simple reason--timing.  When we were attacked by Al Qaeda on 9/11, we did not take immediate action. Yes, we sent a few troops to Afghanistan to try to find Bin Laden, and we patrolled our air space and our borders, but that wasn't enough. After a few months of searching with no Bin Laden turned up, we decided that we needed to change our focus. Bad bad bad.   By changing focus mid-run, we did the worst thing possible. We insulted every Iraqi citizen by telling the world that it was more important to destroy them than it was to find the real evil who committed true crimes against us. We insulted ourselves by underestimating a few psychotic terrorists and thinking we could just go get them and bring them to justice. We forgot that we would have to find them first. We were arrogant and stupid.  What needed to happen: After 9/11, we needed to send every single available troop to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and every other country suspected of harboring Bin Laden and Al Qaeda supporters. We needed to search until every single stone was overturned, and every single man, woman, and child understood the value of human life and the consequences of dismissing it.  Only then. Only after we'd captured every independent figurehead of terror and torment should we have turned our focus to organized terror.  Like I said, I am not anti-war. I only think the timing was completely wrong. Had we shown the world that evil will not be condoned, accepted, or allowed from anyone, from the beginning, other countries and (especially) the citizens of Iraq would not be questioning our motives in unseating the maniac that is Saddam Hussein.    Enough politics for now.  Mik is very excited that we will see public space travel in our lifetime. I think that is the dream of every man born in or after the 60s. I personally have no desire to go, but I'm very excited for all the little boys.  I just can't wait to see what happens next.  How can it be that so many amazing things can happen in the same year as so many horrible things???  I was just wonderling...

      More on the cycle of life... &nbsp; As children, we need love more than anything else. As much as we must be fed, housed, and clothed for our bodies to grow, we need love to nurture our spirits. When we don't receive that as children, our spirit becomes tainted and untrusting. I used to think this was an unfortunate, but surmountable circumstance. I still believe this, but I also believe that the amount of work involved to do this--wait, wait, I'm getting away from my original point. &nbsp; As we grow to become young adults, we must learn to love ourselves. We still need&nbsp;the love of others, but the strength and knowledge and understanding associated with it must come from within. &nbsp; Then something strange happens when we mature. We no longer need love as a staple in our lives. Instead, we need to give love. It is our driving force. To receive love as an adult is a wonderful beautiful thing because, as adults,&nbsp;we now understand the effort and steps needed to be able to give love as it should be truly given. To receive love as an adult is wonderful, but to be able to give love, to find an object for your affection that moves you so deeply that you want to give your entire being to that person is unequivocally the most amazing (and defining) experience of one's life. &nbsp; A quick aside: when I speak of ages involved in the cycle of love, I do not necessarily speak of numerical ages. It is possible for a person of almost any age to be at any stage of the cycle. However, the order of the cycle remains constant. &nbsp; More on this at another time perhaps...

      Where are our Iraqi blogger friends during all this recent excitement? Are they too tired? I don't blame them, but the trial of Saddam Hussein is too big a thing to ignore.  I'm having some serious mixed feelings about all of it. Should we have turned custody over to the Iraqis? It's too soon to tell on that, but I don't think there ever should have been a custody to turn over. Saddam should have been killed the moment he was discovered. Instead, we decided to take him captive in the hopes that he could become political currency. We hoped that someone would want him bad enough that we could use him to exchange for ??? I won't even begin to guess what, but I know it's going to be bad--all of it.  Now that Saddam is in Iraq where he can be attained, we can expect to see even more suicide bombs, more insurgents, more violence. We can expect to see the dirty, disgusting side of "political currency". "You give us Saddam, or we will kill 10,000 more of our people." It will begin soon. Poor Iraq.  In other wonderling events...  Have you read the 24,000 year cycle essay yet? It's your choice whether you want to know more or not, but let me just explain my stance on the whole thing.  We are in the bottom of the upswing right now. That means that we have so much potential as human beings individually and as a race right now that there would be no greater shame than to not even acknowledge that concept. I have recently encountered so many people that simply do not want to know more that I am literally confused. Actually, I have 2 reactions--1. Their lack of curiosity of where we might have come from and what might have happened before us just demonstrates that we are still on the bottom of the cycle, and 2. It irritates me to no end that most people are more happy to swap gossip at the water cooler than they are to actually consider any kind of higher meaning to this life--or any "deep" thought for that matter. I get very frustrated by it all, but I've said my piece, so I will sit in peace ; )  More about me...  I have a twin sister. She is my best friend. Everything that you heard about twins is pretty much true. She can feel it when I am in pain and vice versa. I think being a twin is the closest demonstration to the perfect socialist society that there is. One of us will never have much more than the other, it just wouldn't be right. We naturally maintain this balance without any conscious effort actually. The only reason this works so well though, is because we're both equally hard workers. In our lives, you can't account for luck, but luckily, in our lives (being twins), we don't have to.

      I thought liberals were supposed to be more open minded, more socially conscious than their traditionally more conservative counter parts. I don't know about long gone, but I think those days are certainly gone forever.  Doesn't it seem that instead of furthering the advancements of humanity these "people" (I know, that's a stretch) are 100% for furthering their personal agendas which 99% of the time means destroying what the rest of America has worked so hard to put in place? That's not the scariest part to me though. The scariest part to me is that since September 11, 2001, this liberal thinking has infested and infected large portions of people on the planet who never even had an opinion before. I have to give them credit, those leftists were louder, faster, and more aggressive than anyone ever thought they could be.  The question of the day: Why can't the liberals put as much effort into lobbying for a cure for AIDS/MS/Anthrax/West Nile/The Common Cold as they put into their "Hate Bush" campaign? Why can't the (usually completely ill-informed) Hollywood crowd put their donations into science and education rather than give it to John Kerry so his team of flunkies can litter the internet waves with yet more political spam?  New topic:  I read about the arrest warrants issued for Ahmad Chalabi and his nephew Salem (two different, unrelated crimes). That makes me happy. If we thought there was corruption in politics here, we haven't seen anything. I feel very fortunate (and sympathetic) to not be an Iraqi national right now. It would have been bad enough to have to pledge allegiance to one mad man for fear of your (and your family's) safety, but now you have to pledge allegiance to all of them(believably) because pledging to none of them just isn't an option. Can Iraq say "Gun Control"?  Riverbend, Raed, Salam Pax, and everyone else in Iraq that is true of heart and free of agendas: good luck to you all, I think of you all the time.  That being said, I have some bitching to do about the local mindset in Iraq: You can not blame America and President Bush every single time a bomb goes off, a maniac decides to drive his explosives-laden car into a mosque, a teenage girl gets abducted on her way to school... This is not America's nor Bush's doing. These things did not just start happening in Iraq since the war. These horrible things have been happening all over the world since the technology to do it began.  It is terrible and sad that they are happening in abundance in your forlorn country right now, but it is not us driving the car bombs and abducting your people. However, it is the main reason why we are still in your country. And until we are confident that you can protect yourselves from every psycho with a pipe bomb, we will continue to be there. Don't be mad that we are still there--be mad when we leave.
