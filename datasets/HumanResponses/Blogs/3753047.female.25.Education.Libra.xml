        urlLink It looks like they're calling in the IRR   The IRR, for those of you who didn't know about this, is the Individual Ready Reserve.  Soilders sign up for a certian length of service but actually only serve about half of that.  After they leave the military, they can be called up to serve the rest of their term at any time.  My understanding is that the people who may be called up haven't been in training since leaving the armed forces.  So it's a little like a draft, I guess, in that you have a bunch of people who weren't expecting to have to go to war going over there.  Except that they've already been trained once years ago.  One can only hope their training has stuck with them better than my C++ classes.  I guess this answers the "how are we going to get more troops to fight all these wars" question.   urlLink Slate has a little info about the IRR today

        urlLink Slate  has a little write up about the limits of Iraqi sovereigty.  I have a little beef with the ending paragraph:  Of course, there's nothing that says sovereignty means equanimity. In his new documentary Fahrenheit 9/11, filmmaker Michael Moore notes that the United States invaded "the sovereign nation of Iraq" when it went to war last year. Considering the totality of Saddam Hussein's control at the time, that statement is both correct and seemingly irrelevant. After all, governments such as Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy also met the base-line definition of sovereignty, and American troops helped dislodge them from power, too.   Yeah, yeah.  Of course Germany was in the middle of invading SEVERAL COUNTRIES by the time we went over and invaded them.  It's not comparable in anyway and I thought we had dropped the Hitler/Saddam comparisons a year ago.  It was silly then and it's even more idiotic now.  You could use any number of countries that we've invaded since WWII, why bring up Germany?  Why not use, I don't know, Chile or North Korea?  Geez.  Anyway, I have to say that this whole "hand over" thing is very silly.  The government that's been set up to run Iraq until such time as they have elections doesn't have any more power than it did last week.  We aren't handing over much of anything and we certainly aren't leaving Iraq anytime soon.  I guess it plays with in the papers.  I have noticed that that reports are saying "two days early" like that's some sort of accomplishment.  If the papers were really hating on Bush, they could have said "in secret due to worries of assai nation.  Just a thought.

       People stop listening to you when you  urlLink bust out the Hitler comparisons   This link takes you to the Bush/Cheney '04 website.  Check out the "Kerry's Coalition of the Wild-eyed" ad.  Ok.  How many times do the MoveOn.org people have to say that they  urlLink didn't fund or support those silly Hitler ads?    Bringing up the issue  yet again  just seems desperate.  Is this all Bush has?  Bush spokesman repeat over and over again that Bush has a "clear vision".  He's "optimistic".  Where's the vision, here?  Where's the optimism?  Attack ads speak to neither vision nor optimism.  "I'm not an American hating Nazi like *that* guy" isn't much of a platform for any candidate, let alone a sitting President.  One would think that at this early stage in the campaign Bush would be reminding us of all the wonderful things he's done for the country in the last four years.  I'm not a Bush supporter.  I think he's been a terrible President.  I think this country is worse of than it was four years ago.  But I'm not running his campaign.  If his image-makers can't even come up with something positive, the administration is in serious trouble.    The above links and more comments brought to you by  urlLink Slate .

        urlLink  AP news story about Monday's ruling   So the Court just gave Bush a mild smackdown about detaining citizens without due process.  I don't think they went far enough.  Any citizen in this country has the right to due process no matter what their crime.  That's why we call it a right, people.  If we can go around taking due process away from people we'd call it a nicety.  The government has been holding citizens without access to lawyers for well over two years now.  I thought holding political prisoners was something *other* countries did.  You know, those third world kinds with dicators.  America is better than this.  If we have real evidence against the people being held, let them have their day in court.

       We've been hearing a lot today about the secret hand over of power to the interim government of Iraq.     urlLink http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=U5NVBXYLBXM0ICRBAELCFFA?type=topNews&storyID=5532920"> Reuters story about the transfer   This is clearly not the most popular government ever.  Having to hide the change over because you're afraid of getting blown up doesn't really give you confidence that the will of the people is behind you.  But this change over has got me wondering.  Who are the people "in charge" now?  Where did they come from?  What did they do before they were running this new Iraqi regime?  I found a few outlines of who the head of each department is and a little bit about thier background.  I'd like to dig up a story or two about the actual structure of the government.    urlLink  Guardian UK profile of each minister    urlLink  ABC news, Australia summary of each minister   Apperantly everyone but the Oil Minister has been out of the country since the 80s.  I wouldn't be so skeptical about people who left Iraq while Saddam was in power but with the exception of the Foreign Minister, none of these people have any activism on behalf of thier country on their resume.  If we're so concered with bringing democracy to Iraq, you'd think we would have found some advocates around somewhere.  Maybe actual reformers aren't too into being told what to do by Americans and getting shot by thier own people.  Who knows.

       I suppose I should start out by introducing myself.  My name is Nicole Wilkins.  I’m 25 years old and I live in Oakland, California.  I’m a native Californian.  I graduated from Mills College four years ago with a BA in history.  My focus was 20th century American history (also known as current events) but I’ve also studied some modern Chinese history as well as a good span of European history.  I’m a software programmer.  I’m also a bi-racial queer leftist feminist.  I’ve toyed with the idea of starting this blog and never introducing myself fully.  All of the facts about me that I just shared would allow anyone reading this to dismiss me all too easily.  One of the powerful things about the internet is that it allows you to voice your opinions without being tied to ridiculous identity politics.  You can have a voice without being pigeonholed and dismissed as unimportant.  If you agree with me, what does it matter what I look like, who I am and where I’m from.  If you disagree with me I’d rather you do so because of my ideas and not because of your preconceived notions about what I think.  In the end, though, I decided that the opinions people hold do not form in a vacuum, unrelated to their experiences as flesh and blood human beings.  I think what I think because of my background and you think what you think because of yours.  There’s no way to separate yourself from your experiences.  So here I am.  This is who I am.  This is what I think.  Read what I have to say or don’t.  Put it in any context you wish.   Now that introductions are over, I’m ready to begin.  I’m starting this blog to work out my opinions on politics and American society in general.  I talk sex, money, religion, and politics constantly and I want a space to get more fully formed ideas out.  I don’t expect many people to read this but I’m hoping that those who do comment and start talking back.  I’m open to arguments.  Change my mind.  Find faults.  Find contradictions.  Think, speak, grow.

        urlLink US budget deficit to hit $445bn   The numbers are in.  Let's take a look.   The forecast is, however, lower than a $521bn figure projected in February, an improvement the White House put down to better than expected tax receipts.   Well then.  I guess that's a buy rating right there.  How many times have "fiscal conservatives" yammered on and on about "liberal overspending"?  Too damn many, if this is the best a Republican Congress and White House can do.  You'd think with all those business leaders running the country, we'd be doing a little better.  Oh wait.  Bush is running the country just like all his other businesses - right into the ground.  With a track record like that it's amazing anyone's letting him touch anything.  I guess that's what a Yale degree and a good family name will get you.  If this guy were running a reputable company, he'd be thrown out on his ear.  I'd like to see some "tax and spend" happen here.  This whole no revenue and spend thing seems like a bad idea.  What happened to the "tax cuts will bring us more money" thing?  Oh.  Right.  That was just something people say.  I can see why they waited until such a late time on a Friday to get this news out.  With DemCon making Kerry look so good, these numbers are nothing to brag about.  This is yet another standard to judge Bush unfavorably against.

       Ok.  I'd like to take a quick moment to bitch about these mainstream news orgs starting blogs for DemCon 2004.  Blogs have been around for years, folks.  There are some standards that I think you should need to abide by.  Like having freaking perma links for each entry.  Every damn blog service on earth archives posts as single events.  That way when I need to throw a fit about some off hand comment our press core types, I can do so with ease.  Got that  urlLink CNN ?  How 'bout you  urlLink Slate ?  Slate, I'm most ashamed of you.  You who are entirely and  online  magazine.  What excuse do you have?  None.  That's how much.   You've had a running "blog" in the form of the Kausfiles for years and you have yet to figure out how to format a blog properly.  For shame.  Why can't you be more like your older sibling, cuter  urlLink Salon ?  Would it really be that hard?

        urlLink House Bill Strips Federal Courts of Power Over Same-Sex Cases   I have many things to say about Same-Sex Marriage.  There are a lot of arguments made and a lot of legal wrangling to do.  So right now I'm going to try to focus on the attacks conservatives are making on our court system.  The House just passed a bill that would strip the federal court's jurisdiction on gay marriage issues.  I'm not totally sure how this is would work.  According to this  urlLink Find Law Article :   If the MPA were to become law, the federal courts would be divested of the powers to hear two kinds of "federal question" cases: Cases relating to the MPA itself, and certain cases relating to the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).   It seems to me that the Supreme Court would easily overturn the Act if it were brought to them.  I'm having trouble imagining that the Federal Courts would allow themselves to be bound by such a law.  The entire point of the Supreme Court is to rule on the constitutionality of cases brought before it.  How could Congress limit what they rule on?  The DOMA is iffy on a constitutional level at best so I can understand conservatives trying to pull this sort of thing now.  They must figure that proposing acts that are at base simply a political statement and not a serious law will be enough to energize their base.  The DOMA passed as a meaningless statement.  There were no pro-gay marriage rulings at the time of it's passing. In fact, I'm guessing that the Gay Marriage issue became  more  mainstream after it's passing.  Social conservatives must figure that they can fight for this act as well without fear of doing real damage to our court system.  And real damage they would do.  If the courts actually let this sort of thing pass, where would it stop?  Why not pass all kinds of laws banning anything you please and then pass laws that prevent them from getting stuck down?  It could easily work against conservatives as well as liberals.  Congress could easily pass laws concerning interstate trade.  Say, banning shipping anti-abortion pamphlets across state lines.  Then they could pass a law saying that you couldn't challenge that law in court.  They could do it with gun control as well.  There wouldn't be any limits on what you could ban the courts from ruling about.  The Supreme Court is mostly conservative these days.  They wouldn't want to limit their ability to get precedent set for the things they want any more that liberals do.  Laws can change on a whim, but court rulings have a lasting affect on legal and political debate.  They wouldn't want to limit that affect any more than liberals do.  It's absolutely ridiculous to think that any serious lawmaker would try to get this passed.  The people pushing these things through the House are political attack dogs with no respect for our system of government or the rule of law.  They're trying slick legal tactics to score political points and it is detrimental to the political process.  When our political leaders start rallying around laws like this it sullies the reputation of Congress as a whole.  These law makers are not here to serve the public so much as they're here to gain power and keep power.  They should be ashamed of themselves.

        urlLink White House Helps Block Extension of Tax Cuts   I love this.  The White House blocked extending it's own tax cuts because Democrats weren't opposing it.  That's right, they opposed their own plan because the opposition didn't oppose it.  (Yeah, I love the word 'oppose')  Now, I sort of understand the Bush Team Logic here.  Bush's solution to everything is tax cuts.  (Too much money going to the government?  Cut taxes!  Not enough money going to the government?  Cut taxes!  Too many jobs?  Cut taxes!  Too few jobs?  Cut taxes!)  It's pretty much the only thing he's got to stand one since he's opposed to government spending across the board.  (In theory anyway, we all know how much he likes to spend money on wars of choice and public funding for churches.)  So he can't really offer people government programs to make their lives better.  All he can do is cut taxes and take away funding to government agencies.  So if his single issue has bi-partisan support he can't really run on it, can he?  You want middle class tax cuts?  Both Bush and Kerry will give them to you plus Kerry's going to offer you more stuff.  I'd go with the plus stuff if I were a swing voter.  So Bush has to make sure that he scores big on any tax issues.  But getting something passed that nobody opposes won't make much news and won't really define him as a man with singular vision.  Of course, he'd rather his tax cuts be pushed in with some squabbling and fanfare.  But damn.  Opposing your own plan?  How much sense does that make?  If this story gets a lot of play, you just end up looking like a crass politician with no ethical or ideological foundations.  You end up looking like you don't really care about the American people so much as about your own hold on power and ability to get a good photo op.  And of course, political mongering of this kind keeps you from being able to accuse your opponent of political maneuvering of the same kind.  Way to paint yourself into a corner.  When's Rove getting the boot?

Wow.  This is a damaging claim, if I've ever heard one.  As each argument for the war falls away, we're told that Iraqis are much better off without Hussein in power. Yet we've but men like this in charge of the country?  If that's the only argument hawks have, they're doing a poor job of making sure it continues to be a valid argument.

        urlLink "We've had elections in this country when we were at war, even when we were in civil war.  And we should have the elections on time. That's the view of the president, that's the view of the administration," Rice told CNN on Monday.   So I've been interested in what, exactly  urlLink The Constitution  says about voting for President.  It's interesting.  Our Founding Fathers didn't actually believe in "one man, one vote".  It looks like, technically, we don't have to have an election at all.     Each state shall appoint, in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States, shall be appointed an elector.  The electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves. And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for, and of the number of votes for each; which list they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such majority, and have an equal number of votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President; and if no person have a majority, then from the five highest on the list the said House shall in like manner choose the President. But in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by States, the representation from each state having one vote; A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice. In every case, after the choice of the President, the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President. But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes, the Senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President.     So our state legislators pick out some folks to go vote for President and Vice President.  The popular vote isn't mentioned at all.  It's just sort of a custom, I guess.  "America - the birthplace of modern democracy" my shiny metal ass.  Luckily, the Constitution isn't the only place where the rules of governance are established.  The Congress gets to draw up agreements about when the electors are selected and how disputes are resolved.   urlLink http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/electoral_college/provisions.html">Presidential Election Laws Provisions of the Constitution and United States Code relating to Presidential Elections     The electors of President and Vice President shall be appointed, in each State, on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November, in every fourth year succeeding every election of a President and Vice President.   I guess Congress could choose to suspend the election.  However, Bush's term would still end on the Jan 20, 2005.  At which point, I guess Congress gets to figure out what to do.   In short, Congress would have to OK suspending the election.  I don't have too much confidence in this Congress, considering that most of them didn't even bother to read the Patriot Act before signing it.  They've also pretty much let Bush do whatever he wants, no matter how damaging.  Two things can be done.  One: Write your Senators and Representatives and tell them that you don't support any postponing of elections.  Two: Prepare to take to the street to protest.  I think that the people running this country think that we're just going to accept underhanded crap like this.  Let them know that we will not.  Law doesn't bind them; custom binds them.  We have to make sure they know that we aren't just going to sit down quietly while our system of government is destroyed.

       I'd like to take a moment to talk about Republicans and their dislike of "trial lawyers".  One of the arguments against Edwards that the Bush-Cheney camp has been throwing around is that he's a "trial lawyer" - meaning that he's a personal injury attorney.  Which means that he helps people who've had debilitating accidents get enough money to live, because God knows that the state won't be of much help.   So what's wrong with being a personal injury attorney, exactly?  I mean, yes, you can paint a picture of a sleazy Lionel Hutz style picture of an unethical ambulance chaser, but for the most part personal injury attorneys are just trying to get the best deal they can for their clients.  Isn't that the American way?  Republicans argue that we need to cap the awards people can get in malpractice lawsuits because they're not "fair".  One person with a good attorney can get a lot of money while someone with a lesser attorney will get very little.  They describe this situation as being like winning the lottery.  This is all well and good, if you actually believe that Republicans care anything about equitable distribution of wealth.  It seems pretty clear that they don't, however.  Let's think about it.  Doesn't putting a cap on the amount of an award you can get run contrary to the rights of the individual?  Didn't that trial lawyer do a good job?  Shouldn't she be rewarded for being the very best trial lawyer she can be?  Shouldn't the plaintiff get everything they can out of the system?  And shouldn't doctors be held accountable for their screw-ups?  Isn't that the "personal responsibility" that social conservatives say is so lacking in today's society?  But let's look at it in another way.  Republicans love a good "lottery".  That's why they hate unions, isn't it?  People don't get to negotiate their own wage if unions have set wage standards.  I would argue that non-union labor is like a lottery.  If a company has the budget to hire two employees for the same job, it's highly likely that they won't be paid the same amount.  Each person will have to negotiate their own terms based on very little information about how the company pays or what anyone else is getting.  So person A could, in theory be getting thousands of dollars more a year for the exact same work person B is doing.  Person B may even be a better employee but she didn't win the "wage lottery".    How does this relate to personal injury claims?  Well, Republicans argue that personal injury claims aren't really based on anything but how the jury feels about the plaintiff and there's only so much money to go around so if Plaintiff A gets a lot, plaintiff B will get less.  So instead they want Plaintiff A to get less money.  Ok.  Well, you could look at salary the same way.  Workers A and B aren't being paid for the quality of their work, they're being paid based on how their manager feels about them.  And if Employee A makes a lot of money, it probably means that employee B will make less money to make up for employee A's large salary.    So it seems to me that they really don't care about people getting unequal money for the same things.  What they care about is the insurance lobby not wanting to do their jobs and pay claims.   And somehow they're trying to tar John Edwards because he works against their lobby.  But it seems to me that people like John Edwards are the only thing getting normal voters their claims paid.  Which the Kerry-Edwards campaign could easily argue.  And it would be a compelling argument.  Who'd you rather elect, the guy fighting with the insurance company for you or the guy with the business degree who's on the side of the insurance company?  I think most voters would rather vote for the trial lawyer.  It's a bad argument against Edwards.     Unless, of course, the Republicans aren't really trying to sway Joe Public and are instead trying to get the insurance industry on their side.   Wow.  Good job, guys.

       Why must Bush insist on making cynical conspiracy theorists correct?  How can we, as Americans have confidence that our government officials aren't planning secret take overs of our country in smoke filled rooms when he keeps pulling things like this?   urlLink U.S. Mulling How to Delay Nov Vote in Case of Attack -Reuters    urlLink  Officials discuss how to delay Election Day - CNN    urlLink Report: US 'considering' postponed elections - Al-Jazeera   As soon as Tom Ridge made his terrorist threat announcement last week, the chatter started.  People all over discussed theories as to how Bush was going to use this to scare people away from voting or stop the election all together.  And now they make this announcement.  This whole thing leaves me wondering about Bush and his supposed political savvy.  Bush, I ask you!  How are God fearing, America loving people supposed to keep from questioning Bush and his motives if every crazy liberal conspiracy theory turns out to be true?  How, I ask you, are we supposed to ignore the dire warnings of America haters if you keep taking away rights and scaring people for no reason?  How is Bush supposed to be vindicated by God if he is not allowed to stomp his opponent in the election is there's not election?  And finally how are you going to keep large scale, kids in black masks, Seattle type protests from breaking out when you try to pull a fast one on the American public?  Are you just hoping that we're all so apathetic that destroying the very core of our democratic traditions won't get people off the couch?

       Apparently the AP decided to actually  urlLink look into what the military was telling them about the Iraqi insurgency.   Or rather, the government is changing its story all of a sudden.   Contrary to U.S. government claims, the insurgency in Iraq is led by well-armed Sunnis angry about losing power, not foreign fighters, and is far larger than previously thought, American military officials say.   I guess that whole "we're bringing terrorists out so we can fight them" spin on the Iraqi resistance isn't going to fly anymore.  It was a stupid justification anyway.  Overthrowing a government so that people who have no ties to said government would come fight you?  How is that a plan?  I think Bush has mostly dropped that line of reasoning as of late.  Which is a good idea considering it was so difficult to understand.  So if there weren't any WMDs, and there weren't any terrorists there before hand and there aren't any terrorists now, what exactly are we doing?  We don't even have the support of the Iraqi people.  With our death tolls rising to over 1000, it seems like it might be time to figure out a strategy that isn't just "shoot them all until they shut up".

       I was browsing through the latest issue of Time earlier this week when I noticed this  urlLink tiny story  about the Guantanamo decision last week.  According to this article, while the prisoners have the right to a trial, they may or may not have been informed of this.  It's also unclear as to how anyone who doesn't have a lawyer already will get one.  Great.  So you have the right to a trial but you have no access to the information about getting one.  You may not even know you have that right and after two years of being told that you have no rights, it seems unlikely that anyone will start asking all on their own.  What good is the court ruling in your favor if you have no idea that anything has happened?  Due process doesn't mean a whole lot if you aren't even aware that there is a process.  I realize that it's only been a week since the ruling, but with the amount of foot dragging the Bush administration has done already about these prisoners, it seems unlikely that they'll do anything to forward the prisoners cause without being further prodded by the courts.  Lets hope I'm proven wrong.  And if not, let's hope hat there are some super active lawyers out there.

        urlLink Barbara Ehrenreich's column for the NYT  is making me happy.  In this column she responds to the comments Bill Cosby recently made about those oh-so-lazy Black youths of today.  I agree with  urlLink Timothy Noah.   I hope they try to keep her on staff.  I think she's a sharp writer and would make and excellent columnist.  Also, I really enjoyed Nicked and Dimed and I think everyone should read it.  It's an eye opener for us college educated middle class types.

       Tom Ridge announced today that  urlLink Terroists might be planning something around election time.  I have trouble taking these announcements too seriously.  The office of Homeland Security makes all kinds of announcements about up coming events and I don't see how this is any different.  They seem to sever to get people a little on edge about whatever event they were planning on attending but they don't seem to do much else.  The Bush administration would probably argue that this is their attempt at keeping the public informed.  It seems to me that it would be much more useful to make specific local announcements about threats than to scare everyone in the nation.  It's pretty unlikely that international terrorists are going to hit a little town in the Midwest so why make the people living there on edge?  And people in major cities like Washington DC and New York know that there's always a vague threat.  How is getting on TV and announcing a bigger vague threat useful to them?  The Bush people aren't stupid.  They know that getting on TV and telling people that we could be Attacked At Any Time is only going to foster a sense of fear and not do any good.  It seems to be their aim.  So given that, it is deeply disturbing to me that they're making these announcements about threats to our "democratic traditions".  It seems to me that if previous announcements of threats have only served to scare people about going to 4th of July picnics and shopping malls at Christmas, this threat announcement can only serve to scare people about going to the polls, going to rallies, or protesting at the conventions.  Now, I like to think people will still go to the polls, but I have my doubts.  If people are afraid of something happening while they vote they may just avoid going.  I think that further scares about the election could also serve to get people scared enough to want to postpone the election until the threats have passed.  This all seems too 1984 for me, but who knows?  So many tactics the Bush administration have used have smacked of the Orwellian as it is.  I couldn't rule it out entirely.  Terrorists attacking before the election would only serve to re-elect Bush, as this article in Slate  urlLink points out.  I think simple threats of it may do the same.  I think that it's our duty to go out and be as active as possible during this election.  If no one votes, the terrorists have already won.     urlLink Full Transcript what Ridge said

       It's been a slow news day for me.  Not a lot had caught my eye.  But I am delighted to see that  urlLink Ken Lay's getting indicted.   I'm happy to see that he is actually going to face a trial.  Let's hope he actually has to serve some time.  It's the best we can hope for since it's highly doubtful that he'd have to give up any of his ill-gotten gains, which would be the most appropriate punishment.  How bad is it to get convicted of a crime if you can live without having a job for the rest of your life?  I think investor fraud should be dealt with at least as harshly as drug crimes.  Enron's misdeeds directly hurt thousands of people.  I think raising energy bills of elderly and poor people and stealing the savings of many thousands of your own workers ranks up there with whatever societal harm you could claim drug dealers do.  We take everything a drug dealer owns - houses, cars, cash money - no matter how much or little they're caught with.  It seems like we could do the same with CEOs committing the scale of fraud this guy did.    He wasn't even a very good CEO!  You'd think Enron could have done better just messing with energy prices in CA.  But even with that, Enron still didn't turn profits.  The hell?

       The US tends to give lip service to using international organizations.  And by lip service, I mean that it seems like we are all for them but only if they do exactly what we want.  The Iraq war is a recent example, but our flip-flops on international organizations have a much longer history.  Our pulling out of the Kyoto agreement is another example.  As is our use of unilateral actions against the governments of small countries with whom we disagree - Vietnam, Chile, ect.  So I decided to look a little bit more into our opposition to the International Criminal Court.  I found  urlLink this  on the state.gov website.  It's our announcement that even though we signed the agreement to start this thing, Bush has decided that we aren't going to recognize its authority.  I find the logic to be a little flawed.    -We believe that states, not international institutions are primarily responsible for ensuring justice in the international system. -We believe that the best way to combat these serious offenses is to build domestic judicial systems, strengthen political will and promote human freedom.     Ok.  Now, the whole point of the ICC is that war criminals wouldn't be prosecuted by their governments.  Either the criminals are  running  the government or they're following the orders of people running the government.  Your run of the mill war crime (mistreatment of POWs, rapes, theft, et cetera) is committed daily by troops from every country in the world.  The ICC wasn't established to take care of those things.  The ICC was established to take care of the heads of state who order or condone genocide and widespread, systematic war crimes.  As such, the heads of state would not be brought to justice without force from the outside.  Domestic systems of justice work well for prosecuting those offences committed by people low enough on the totem poll that high government officials won't be brought down by the trials.  These arguments really don't apply to most of the governments in the world in the first place.  Domestic court systems?  How is a dictatorship supposed to prosecute its war criminals?  That's ridiculous on it's face.  The Bush administration used past war crimes as a reason to overthrow Saddam Hussein.  Clearly they don't actually think that such crimes need to be dealt with domestically or we would not have used that as a reason, right?    We have concluded that the International Criminal Court does not advance these principles. Here is why:  -We believe the ICC undermines the role of the United Nations Security Council in maintaining international peace and security.    Huh.  Is this the same Security Council that we deemed useless in the case of Iraq?  It interests me that we use that a measure for international legitimacy and then call it useless.  Which is it, people?  The rest of this document is more of the same.  The only point that they make that actually means anything is that the Bush administration sees the ICC as a threat to our sovereignty.  And it is.  I mean, we can't just go around doing anything we damn well please if we have an organization out there with the authority to hold our leaders personally accountable for their actions.

        urlLink Short Washington Times story about pre-war interviews with family member of Iraqi scientists.   Ok.  Now I can see how you'd be inclined to not believe Iraqis who claimed that that Iraq didn't have banned weapons.  I mean, they'd be risking thier lives to say otherwise, right?  But this on top of all the clearly false "evidence" that we were throwing around just makes us look bad.  You'd think that we'd be somewhat inclinded to listen to people who have direct contacts with those in the know.  Instead we chose to believe the shakey rumors from  urlLink some guy working for Iran?   Oh, speaking of Chalabi, what is this I hear about his nephew being in charge of the Sadamn tribunal?  I'm having a hard time finding a story that even mentions that Salim Chalabi is related to Ahmad Chalabi even though they're family members.  Weird.

       It looks like  urlLink John Kerry finally picked a running mate.   Edwards has been rumored to be the front runner for a while now so there aren't any suprises here.  I'm glad this issues has been settled.  I was tired of hearing conservatives babble on and on about how much they wanted Hillary to run.  It was getting tired.  I don't really have much of an opinion about Edwards.  He's a lot more photogenic than Kerry.  That's about all I can say for him.  He's pretty.  I am glad he didn't pick Gephart as the  urlLink New York Post  announced.  Gephart would be way too establishment.  He's been around too long and Kerry's voting history will already be a huge issue in the election.  Edwards was hardly in office before running for President.  He's a safe choice.  Now we'll be yawning all the way to November.  I wonder what the parties are planning to do to keep the press at their conventions.  The Republicans have no drama and neither do the Democrats now.  I suppose the Republicans are hoping for some rioting in New York.  I don't know what the Dems have planned.  Maybe they'll let Nader speak.

       Last Friday several house members sent a letter to the UN  urlLink requesting election observers be bought in for the November elections.   I'm not sure how much press this has received but  urlLink Rush Limbaugh  and  urlLink Al-Jazeera  both picked up the story.  I'm pretty surprised that anyone in our government would go so far as to contact the UN about election fraud here.  We generally think ourselves above that sort of thing.  I guess people really are still pissed off about what happened in 2000.  I notice, however, that the signatures of this letter were all in the House.  I'm concerned that no Senators have been willing to take the political risk.  It's pretty clear that election fraud happened in Florida last time around (not to mention the questionable happenings in other states), why won't any Senators take a stand on this?  It seems to me that election fraud hurts everyone.  We bemoan the lack of voter turn out and yet we turn away voters.  Why would anyone think that they have a stake in the political process if you can't even be sure you can vote at all?  I think everyone in the government (and hell, everyone working and volunteering for our political parties) should make this a top concern.  How can we talk about bringing democracy to other countries if our voting system is broken?  We need to be an example to the rest of the world.  It's bad enough that we don't have a "one man, one vote" system here.  (The Electoral College guarantees that voters in some states are more important than voters in others.  Even if there was not voting fraud in Florida and the state really did go to Bush, Gore still would have had the popular vote.  You can see from this example that the people do not directly elect the person in the highest office in the land.)  Why make it worse?  I'm guessing that many people will argue that asking the UN to observer the election just makes us look bad to the rest of the world.  Airing our dirty laundry in public and all that.  I disagree.  I think that having   someone  in the government willing to take any measures necessary to have a clean election shows that we really do care about our democracy.  The letter is clearly just a publicity tactic designed to highlight their concerns about the election.  Hopefully it will serve to make people more aware of voting rights issues.

        urlLink Al Jazeera article about the Afgahn elections   I heard about this on NPR this morning, but a quick look on google news and top AP stories didn't have it.  The Al Jazeera article also talks about the continued fighting there.  Anyhow, according to Al Jazeera the elections have been postponed because the 22 diffrent political parties couldn't agree on a date or what should be voted on.  22 parties.  That's pretty amazing.  I wonder how much a base each party has.  All the reports I've read indicate that the newly installed government doesn't reach too far away from the captial.  Are they parties represting war lords or are there real parties there?  It's unfortunate that Afghanistan has fallen out of the news.  Our government rebuilding track record isn't so stellar and I think the press ignoring the situation in Afghanistan has allowed the government to ignore the situation there.  It's also allowed Bush to paint our allies in Europe as false friends even though they helped us in Afghanistan and continued to do so while we were changing the name of the french fries on Captial Hill.    Hopefully the press focus on Iraq will continue.  I'd like to see at least one of our efforts turn out well.

       Intresting.   urlLink U.S. Removes Peacekeepers Over War Crimes Court   We're pulling out some troops from Kosovo and Ethiopia because they aren't going to be exempt from prosecution in the international criminal court.    I don't know what our beef with the criminal court actually is.  According to this article, the US argument against the International Criminal Court is that politically motivated suits would be brought against US troops.  I suppose that might be the case, but I’m wondering who would be bringing these suits if we aren’t doing anything.  War’s messy.  I’m assuming that even the best intentioned force could end up being accused of war crimes.  It just seems to me that unless we’re breaking international law all over the place, isolated incidents would probably not be prosecuted.  But I could be wrong.    I’d like to hear more about our opposition to the court.

       How many times have you seen American pundits and American administration officials complain about the foreign press and their "anti-American bias"?  Over and over again we're told that the press from other countries don't try to stay objective, that they have an agenda they're pushing.  You can't take anything they report on seriously, they're just biased.  Now, I know that any thinking person will recognize that our media has some bias to it.  Conservatives argue that it's all "liberal bias".  Liberals, on the other hand, will argue that there's either no bias in the media or else it's slightly right. (I personally see little to no liberal bias in the media.  If the media was really biased left we'd all know about good recipes for vegan cookies and how to run our cars on  urlLink biodiesel  or vegetable oil.) In any case, most people recognize that there is  some  kind of bias in the media.  But I think people fail to realize the kind of pro-American bias we see every day.  It's the American media; American companies and American people run it.  There's going to be a heavy American bias.  That's normal.  I just want people to notice this when looking at our news sources.  Case in point:  urlLink  Defiant Saddam Rejects War Crimes Charges.   "What's biased about this headline?" you ask.  Well, first off "Saddam" is not the man's last name.  It's his first name.  Would you ever see an article about GWB refer to him as "George"?  No, obviously no.  Bush isn't Madonna; we use his last name.  So why are we using Saddam Hussein's first name all the time.  He isn't Madonna either.  And another thing, for the last few days any pictures of Saddam Hussein you saw were from when he was captured.  Nothing of the man in a suit or, I don't know, his hair combed.  You could argue that the capture photos were the most recent picture of him but, you know, when Regan died you didn't see hundreds of pictures of him crapping his pants.  I bet you there were many recent photos of him with drool on his face that we'd never see.  I'm not defending Hussein here, nor am I comparing him in stature to Regan.  I'm just pointing out the bias we can see in little things like what pictures get shown with a news story.  And while we're talking bias, I should go find some stories about Clinton while he was in office.  GWB is almost always shown as a large figure in front of a flag or a sign that says "integrity" or "progress" or some other silly thing.  I don't remember this from Clinton's presidency.  I could be wrong.  Clinton could have always been photographed like that, but I doubt it.  I think it's probably another case of not-so-subtle bias that no one ever thinks about.

        urlLink Bush plans to remove troops from around the world.   Man, can Bush time anything properly?  Normally I'd welcome any scaling back of our military around the world, but with the way Bush has conducted foreign policy these last four years this just comes off like a five year old throwing a fit and taking all his toys home.  I'm not sure how this fits into Bush's overarching strategy of global domination, though.  It seems to me that Germany is a better place to launch an attack on Iran or whatever country he dislikes this week.  Pulling out of these countries seems like it would be counter to what he wants to do.  Unless, of course, he thinks that this will punish our allies.  Or he's getting kicked out and is trying to cover....

       I'm so tired of this stupid "statistical likelihood" argument about racial profiling.   urlLink Steven E. Landsburg, you're an idiot.   In today's Slate, he makes two basic arguments:   But there are two points those on both sides seem to have missed. First, detaining 14 Middle Eastern men is neither more nor less an infringement of civil liberties than detaining 14 passengers chosen at random. Either way, 14 people have their liberty infringed.   And:   If you're going to detain 14 people, they should at least be the 14 people who are statistically most likely to be worth detaining.   ...  Now, that first argument is a little silly.  People don't get detained at random.  They get searched at random.  Their luggage gets searched at random.  We aren't dragging random people to the backroom for questioning at random, though.  The premise that since we're going to detain people anyway so it might as well be Arabs is false to begin with.  Besides which, I would argue that it's much more of a threat to civil liberties to detain specific people rather than random people.  Random searchers are problematic on their own.  You can at least argue that while you're giving up your right to privacy you do so willingly for safety reasons.  If everyone else has to give up these rights, you aren't putting people into special classes.    Pulling people out of line because they look a certain way is a much, much bigger problem.  This creates two classes of people.  You're asking one class of people to give up freedoms that you yourself do not wish to give up.  How is creating a racial class system where some are denied their rights while others are not ok?  How many times must it be said that racial profiling like this is simply not going to work?  I haven't written anything about this yet, so I think I'll do it now.  Racial profiling in an attempt to catch terrorists is not going to work.  It will not work for a variety of reasons.  It will not work because racial profiling will not screen everyone you think it will, but it will screen thousands of people that you don't think you'll screen.  It will not work because racial profiling wastes resources.  And finally, it will not work because as soon as you have some screen process down pat, the profile of the people you're looking for will change.  Lets take this point-by-point.  Racial profiling will not work because it will not screen everyone you think it will, but it will screen thousands of people that you don't think you'll screen.  Case in point: me.  I have been taken for just about every broad ethnic or racial group under the sun, often times by people in said racial or ethnic group.  That's why I call my blog "ethnically ambiguous".  I am.  So if you start screening people simply because they "look" Arab, you'll screen me.  I'm not Arab.  I'm not even Muslim.  By your criteria, I'm not any more of a danger than the old Midwestern lady everyone feels bad about inconveniencing.  Using the "statistical likelihood" argument, I should not be held up.  I should breeze right through security.  But I'm not going to because I'm brown.  On the flip side of this, I have known a great many Arab-Americans who "look white".  They would never set off your radar.  They're ethnically ambiguous too; they're just not brown.  There are more non-"ethnic looking" Arabs running around than you think.  So while harmless me is sitting around having my underwear searched, you're letting the "statically likely" person walk right through security no questions asked.  Ok, you say, how about just screening everyone from an Arab country?  All the 9/11 hijackers are from Arab countries, right?  Sure.  Unfortunately, not everyone with Islamic terrorist leanings is from an Arab nation - hell not all of them are even Arabs.  Several people held in Guantanamo Bay right now are British or Australian.  The Brits and Aussies are our great allies and yet we're holding their countrymen indefinitely for fighting with the Taliban.  We even caught one of our own - a white kid from Marin county named John Lindh.  Why don't we just detain everyone who's ever opened a copy of the Q'uran?  Short of that, there's no good way to screen people based an affiliation with some group.  Racial profiling is going to let terrorists breeze through security and detain innocent folks from the Midwest.  Hey, sounds like what you say is going on now!  Next point: Racial will not work because it wastes resources.  I think I've already outlines how it will be entirely ineffective in screen all the people you think you want to screen.  You'd have to increase your resources ten fold in order to handle detaining all the brown/Muslim/Arab/whatever, folks.  Throwing all that money away when you're not even all that likely to screen the people you want to is wasteful.  But here's another factor - all those people freaking out because we aren't profiling are on the lookout for strange behavior.  Is someone acting weird near the bathroom?  You're going to notice and tell a flight attendant.  But if you think you're safe because all those "likely terrorists" you were worried about have been screened you're much less likely to be on guard.  So you're wasting government resources and you're not even looking out for yourself.  Waste, waste, waste.  Hell, it's more wasteful to profile screen than it is to randomly screen and you have no guarantee of effectiveness!  How safe is that?  And finally, racial profiling is not a well thought out idea because as soon as you have some screen process down pat, the profile of the people you're looking for will change.  I know we all like to think that terrorists are all exactly the same nationality, color, ethnic group, but they're not.  There were people supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan from all over the world.  I'm absolutely sure that Islamic terrorists could eventually find someone who does not fit your profile in any way and use that person.  Racial profiling would work for just as long as no one knows you're using racial profiling.  As so as you know for sure you're going to get screened you're going to find someone else to do your dirty work for you.  So, sure, for the next year you might be able to effectively screen people, maybe.  But you can't hope that it will last any longer than that.  Racial profiling is a wasteful system with no guarantee of success.  Why do we even need to argue about it's worth?  Instead of endlessly debating whether or not it's ok to screen hundreds of thousands of people based on a model that will change as soon as you start screening, we should be thinking of better security measures that have an actual change of working.

        urlLink Afghan electioneering gets nasty   Looks like Karzai dropped his running mate for the October election.  His running mate was the current Vice President and defense minister, Muhammad Fahim.  According to Al-Jazeera, there's talk that he did so to split up the ethnic Tajik vote:   Afghan politicians and analysts believe Karzai's change of partner nine weeks before the presidential election has effectively split the Tajik vote.  More than a quarter of all Afghans are Tajiks. They number in excess of four million people and form the second largest ethnic group after Pashtuns.     According to  urlLink Reuters  Fahim is now backing Karzai's main opponent, Education Minister Yunus Qanuni.  Apparently Qanuni decided to run after Karzai dumped Fahim.  Fahim is also accusing Karzai of having lost support from Northern Alliance leaders.     urlLink NPR:    Afghan President Hamid Karzai is seeking the support of former Taliban officials in an effort to stabilize the democratic process. The U.S.-backed Karzai has been fighting insurgents, some of them Taliban, since he took office.   Good times.  Good times.

       I watched John Kerry's speech last Thursday.  I think I'm going to end up voting for the guy, but there's not a whole lot about the platform he's presented that I can get behind.   John Kerry .  My Smart-ass comments.  Please note that I'm cutting out the boring bits.   urlLink Here's the BBC's full text.  ....   My fellow Americans: we are here tonight united in one simple purpose: to make America stronger at home and respected in the world.      Bush has totally completely pissed off the rest of the world.  If elected, we may be forgiven.  I promise not to piss everyone off.  This is one of Kerry's strongest selling points.  I think most people can agree that we actually need the rest of the world to get on board with our anti-terrorist plans.  International terrorism requires and international effort.  Bush doesn't seem to get that.       I was born in Colorado, in Fitzsimmons Army Hospital, when my dad was a pilot in World War II.  Now, I'm not one to read into things, but guess which wing of the hospital the maternity ward was in?  I'm not making this up.  I was born in the West Wing!        Man, how much was i hoping he'd say 'the left wing'.  I'm not sure anyone but those "God chose George Bush' folks really wants a guy who was destined to be President.  I dunno.  Maybe that's just me.    My mother was the rock of our family as so many mothers are. She stayed up late to help me do my homework. She sat by my bed when I was sick, and she answered the questions of a child who, like all children, found the world full of wonders and mysteries.     She was my den mother when I was a Cub Scout and she was so proud of her fifty year pin as a Girl Scout leader. She gave me her passion for the environment.  She taught me to see trees as the cathedrals of nature. And by the power of her example, she showed me that we can and must finish the march toward full equality for all women in our country.        "Hey ladies, here's a shout out.  I like my mom and by extension I like you.  I'm not really promising you anything useful besides being pro-choice right now, but hey, that's not so bad, right?"  Ok.   urlLink I appreciate the shout out.  Thanks.  You do mention the wage gap and the fact that women get worse healthcare than men.  You get some points.  But, like every other damn thing on your site, you tell me that you care and then don't really have anything concrete to address these issues.  "I've noticed that the situation for women sorta sucks" is nice but I'm demanding.  I want more than that out of a candidate.  This just feels like nice rhetoric without much intention of action.     My dad did the things that a boy remembers.  He gave me my first model airplane, my first baseball mitt and my first bicycle.  He also taught me that we are here for something bigger than ourselves; he lived out the responsibilities and sacrifices of the greatest generation to whom we owe so much.         "I like women, but don't worry.  I'm still a man.  Look, I played baseball."    I like that this assumes that a  girl  wouldn't have played baseball or rode bikes around.  You know, I played softball and rode a swank black boys bike.  In a skirt.  Hey!  My dad did the things that a boy remembers too, only for his daughter!  *gasp*  I live in a world where Title 9 is still being blamed for budget cuts in the "important" sports because they have to fund "girls sports" too.  Yeah.  Kerry's better than Bush, but he's not impressing me.  Yeah, yeah, I know that's might not be the intended message, but why throw that in there?  The bit about "things a boy remembers"?  It is there to contrast with the mother things.  But those are typical all American boy things too.  He's doing it to make it clear that he's not some wussy boy.  He grew up like all the other boys.  A "real" boy.  "Also, I respect my elders.  I really want you old folks to vote."  (cut to babble about growing up in Germany.  That one joke he made might have been funny if Kerry were better at telling jokes.)       But what I learned has stayed with me for a lifetime. I saw how different life was on different sides of the same city. I saw the fear in the eyes of people who were not free.  I saw the gratitude of people toward the United States for all that we had done. I felt goose bumps as I got off a military train and heard the Army band strike up "Stars and Stripes Forever."  I learned what it meant to be America at our best. I learned the pride of our freedom.  And I am determined now to restore that pride to all who look to America.        "Let's all remember that one time we did a good job rebuilding a country.  Hey!  I was there then.  I've actually been overseas!  Fighting Soviets!  When I was 5!"    Mine were greatest generation parents. And as I thank them, we all join together to thank that whole generation for making America strong, for winning World War II, winning the Cold War, and for the great gift of service which brought America fifty years of peace and prosperity.          "Just in case you forgot it, I like the old folks!"    My parents inspired me to serve, and when I was a junior in high school, John Kennedy called my generation to service.  It was the beginning of a great journey, a time to march for civil rights, for voting rights, for the environment, for women, and for peace. We believed we could change the world. And you know what? We did.        I do like this.  It contrasts nicely with GWB's unfocused youth.  Kerry's a straight arrow with a sense of duty.  It also gives a shout out to the liberals out there.  Bravo.    But we're not finished. The journey isn't complete.  The march isn't over.  The promise isn't perfected.   Tonight, we're setting out again.  And together, we're going to write the next great chapter of America's story.      We have it in our power to change the world again.  But only if we're true to our ideals  and that starts by telling the truth to the American people. That is my first pledge to you tonight.  As President, I will restore trust and credibility to the White House.     Ok.  He starts good, but ends a little weak.  He's right, minority and women's rights aren't fully realized.  But I'm not totally sure "telling the truth to the American people" is exactly the place to start.  I don't think that women earn 77 cents on the dollar to men because Bush is a lying bastard.  I think they're getting paid 77cents on the dollar because of bad hiring practices and unenforced equal rights policies.    I ask you to judge me by my record:  As a young prosecutor, I fought for victim's rights and made prosecuting violence against women a priority.  When I came to the Senate, I broke with many in my own party to vote for a balanced budget, because I thought it was the right thing to do.  I fought to put a 100,000 cops on the street.       "Hey, I'm not like those pansy-ass criminal loving liberals!  I like cops!  And balanced budgets!  Look!  Cops!"    And then I reached across the aisle to work with John McCain, to find the truth about our POW's and missing in action, and to finally make peace with Vietnam.        "Hey swing voters!  John McCain worked with me a couple of times.  We all over John McCain, right?  Ok, sure he's working for the other guy right now.  But look!  John McCain!"  Hey, I'm all for getting closure on the Vietnam POW issue.  I know that was important to vets, but the John McCain dropping here is just silly.      I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war.  I will have a Vice President who will not conduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws.  I will have a Secretary of Defense who will listen to the best advice of our military leaders.   And I will appoint an Attorney General who actually upholds the Constitution of the United States.        "Read my lips - no new neocons!"  (skippping some stuff about how bad your quality of life is)   We're told that outsourcing jobs is good for America. We're told that new jobs that pay $9,000 less than the jobs that have been lost is the best we can do.  They say this is the best economy we've ever had.  And they say that anyone who thinks otherwise is a pessimist.  Well, here is our answer:  There is nothing more pessimistic than saying America can't do better.      We can do better and we will.  We're the optimists. For us, this is a country of the future. We're the can do people.  And let's not forget what we did in the 1990s. We balanced the budget. We paid down the debt.  We created 23 million new jobs. We lifted millions out of poverty and we lifted the standard of living for the middle class. We just need to believe in ourselves and we can do it again.        Good job deflecting the "dour liberal" thing.  I like this theme and that whole "taking back the flag" thing he does later.  (skipping the crap about Edwards and his wife and Kerry's wife.  Yeah, yeah, kiss kiss love love.)    And in this journey, I am accompanied by an extraordinary band of brothers led by that American hero, a patriot named Max Celand.  Our band of brothers doesn't march together because of who we are as veterans, but because of what we learned as soldiers. We fought for this nation because we loved it and we came back with the deep belief that every day is extra.  We may be a little older now, we may be a little greyer, but we still know how to fight for our country.        "Hey, man, I've actually served in the military unlike you-know-who."  I think it might have been this point in the speech where Max Celand clapped with his hand and his amputated leg.  That was priceless.  (cutting out the "we're not holding grudges thing about the primaries)    My fellow Americans, the world tonight is very different from the world of four years ago. But I believe the American people are more than equal to the challenge.        SPETEMBER 11 CHANGED EVERYTHING!  (snip)    I am proud that after September 11th all our people rallied to President Bush's call for unity to meet the danger. There were no Democrats.  There were no Republicans. There were only Americans.  How we wish it had stayed that way.        Wait...what now?  You wish we'd all remained united under Bush?  Are you sure about that because he still sucked back then.  The economy didn't just tank when he started  the war in Iraq.  All those domestic problems didn't just appear out of nowhere.  Whatever.  I guess you're trying to dodge Republicans calling you un-American for campaigning against Bush during a war, but dude the war isn't why I want him out.  And you go on later to talk about how militant you're willing to be so it's not like you're the peace candidate or anything.     Now I know there are those who criticize me for seeing complexities  and I do  because some issues just aren't all that simple.  Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so.  Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesn't make it so. And proclaiming mission accomplished certainly doesn't make it so.       As President, I will ask hard questions and demand hard evidence.  I will immediately reform the intelligence system  so policy is guided by facts, and facts are never distorted by politics.  And as President, I will bring back this nation's time-honoured tradition: the United States of America never goes to war because we want to, we only go to war because we have to.       Nice.  Stand by being intellectually engaged.  That Bush guy might as well be napping his whole way through his presidency.    I know what kids go through when they are carrying an M-16 in a dangerous place and they can't tell friend from foe.  I know what they go through when they're out on patrol at night and they don't know what's coming around the next bend. I know what it's like to write letters home telling your family that everything's all right when you're not sure that's true.       In case you missed it, war hero.    As President, I will wage this war with the lessons I learned in war.  Before you go to battle, you have to be able to look a parent in the eye and truthfully say: "I tried everything possible to avoid sending your son or daughter into harm's way. But we had no choice. We had to protect the American people, fundamental American values from a threat that was real and imminent."  So lesson one, this is the only justification for going to war.    And on my first day in office, I will send a message to every man and woman in our armed forces: You will never be asked to fight a war without a plan to win the peace.       That's funny, because you're keeping us in Iraq.  And um...promising to use the military to do exactly what Bush is using the military to do.  So um.  Ok.    I know what we have to do in Iraq.  We need a President who has the credibility to bring our allies to our side and share the burden, reduce the cost to American taxpayers, and reduce the risk to American soldiers.  That's the right way to get the job done and bring our troops home.       Here is the reality: that won't happen until we have a president who restores America's respect and leadership -- so we don't have to go it alone in the world.       And we need to rebuild our alliances, so we can get the terrorists before they get us.       Ok.  Good, good.  So you're willing to work with the UN and take their advice when they say that going in somewhere is a bad idea, right?    I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as President.  Let there be no mistake:  I will never hesitate to use force when it is required.  Any attack will be met with a swift and certain response. I will never give any nation or international institution a veto over our national security.  And I will build a stronger American military.       Oh.  Um.  Ok.  So no.  No you won't.  So how, exactly is this policy any different from Bush's?  I'm supposed to just trust that you won't go around invading people.  Because, of course, you saw the intel on Iraq and decided to vote against it....oh wait.  You voted for it.  You voted for a war of choice, based on shaky intel.  But you were on the intel committee in the Senate so you should have known it was shaky.  And you voted for it anyway.  And you're not going to take the advice of the UN if you don't feel like it.    Right.  Great.  Well, you've got my war-protest vote.    We will add 40,000 active duty troops not in Iraq, but to strengthen American forces that are now overstretched, overextended, and under pressure. We will double our special forces to conduct anti-terrorist operations. We will provide our troops with the newest weapons and technology to save their lives  and win the battle.  And we will end the backdoor draft of National Guard and reservists.       Ah.  So you'll expand our military to send kids in harm's way on a war that we all know is founded on nothing.  Yay!  Sign me up!  (snip)    We need to make America once again a beacon in the world. We need to be looked up to and not just feared.         ...by not promising to honor our obligations to the UN or act in accordance with it's mandates....    We need to lead a global effort against nuclear proliferation to keep the most dangerous weapons in the world out of the most dangerous hands in the world.        "Now that all the nuclear powers in the world are our allies, I don't think anyone else should get nukes."  Bold.  Real bold.    We need a strong military and we need to lead strong alliances.  And then, with confidence and determination, we will be able to tell the terrorists: You will lose and we will win.  The future doesn't belong to fear; it belongs to freedom.         "I ain't no hippie!  But you know, it'd be sorta nice if other countries could pay for a few things now and then.  But I'm not promising anything.  Screw you, France!"     And the front lines of this battle are not just far away they're right here on our shores, at our airports, and potentially in any town or city. Today, our national security begins with homeland security. The 9-11 Commission has given us a path to follow, endorsed by Democrats, Republicans, and the 9-11 families.  As President, I will not evade or equivocate; I will immediately implement the recommendations of that commission.  We shouldn't be letting ninety-five percent of container ships come into our ports without ever being physically inspected.  We shouldn't be leaving our nuclear and chemical plants without enough protection.  And we shouldn't be opening firehouses in Baghdad and closing them down in the United States of America.        Ah.  Please follow through with this and fund our first responders.  I'd like that. In fact, I think people should be far more worried that we don't have the funding for first responders here that we should.  Who cares if we invade France if a grenade in an office building can't be responded to properly?  (snip)   That flag doesn't belong to any president. It doesn't belong to any ideology and it doesn't belong to any political party. It belongs to all the American people.        "I can flag wave with the best of 'em!" I'm actually all for taking the flag back from Republicans.  I can't stand that seeing flag waving makes me think of neocons and religious zealots.  I'd like to see it stand for more than that.  Of course, Kerry likes to get his war on so I'm not sure how much will change.    My fellow citizens, elections are about choices. And choices are about values.  In the end, it's not just policies and programs that matter; the president who sits at that desk must be guided by principle.        WHAT?!?!?!?  No he didn't.  Did he just say that his "values" are more important than his policies?  What?  How does that even make sense.    "Please don't vote for Nader.  I promise I'm liberal too, even if I won't implement any of my policies."    For four years, we've heard a lot of talk about values. But values spoken without actions taken are just slogans.  Values are not just words.  They're what we live by. They're about the causes we champion and the people we fight for. And it is time for those who talk about family values to start valuing families.         Doesn't that just contradict what he said above?  Are values our actions or not?  (snip nice use of repetition in listing off all the way Bush has failed to provide anything useful to people)     We believe that what matters most is not narrow appeals masquerading as values, but the shared values that show the true face of America.  Not narrow appeals that divide us, but shared values that unite us.  Family and faith.  Hard work and responsibility. Opportunity for all so that every child, every parent, every worker has an equal shot at living up to their God-given potential.       "Bush is trying to play on your baser instincts.  Don't let him."  (snip all these "real life" examples.  he's pumping me so full of sap I'm blowing my nose with a pancake.)    And so we come here tonight to ask: Where is the conscience of our country?        I dunno, where?    I'll tell you where it is: it's in rural and small town America; it's in urban neighbourhoods and suburban main streets; it's alive in the people I've met in every part of this land. It's bursting in the hearts of Americans who are determined to give our country back its values and its truth.        Oh.  There it is!  Under my couch!    We value jobs that pay you more not less than you earned before.  We value jobs where, when you put in a week's work, you can actually pay your bills, provide for your children, and lift up the quality of your life.  We value an America where the middle class is not being squeezed, but doing better.        I'd also like to say that I value a job where I can get a raise instead of having to company hop to earn more money.  But hey, I'll take what I can get.  Also, last time I checked the middle class could generally pay their bills.  It's the working class and working poor who can't make ends meet.  What's up with this middle class thing?  I guess most people in this country consider themselves middle class even if they aren't but man, you'd think you could use the right terms here.    So here is our economic plan to build a stronger America:         Yay!  New plans!    First, new incentives to revitalize manufacturing.       Second, investment in technology and innovation that will create the good-paying jobs of the future.       Third, close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping our jobs overseas.  Instead, we will reward companies that create and keep good paying jobs where they belong in the good old U.S.A.        We value an America that exports products, not jobs and we believe American workers should never have to subsidize the loss of their own job.        I think the manufactuaring boat has sailed, dude.  The 90s took care of that.  Yay!  investment in technology!  That'll be great for those of us who were already on the right side of the digital divide.  Oh.  That's nice.  Close those gaps!  And while you're at it, could you stop giving contracts to companies that have tax shelters in the Bahamas?    Next, we will trade and compete in the world.  But our plan calls for a fair playing field because if you give the American worker a fair playing field, there's nobody in the world the American worker can't compete against.         What now?  Fair playing field?  What does that mean, exactly?  Higher tariffs?  Getting the WTO to force other countries to bend to our will?  Or do you mean relaxing regulations here so it's like third world countries?    And let me tell you what we won't do: we won't raise taxes on the middle class. You've heard a lot of false charges about this in recent months. So let me say straight out what I will do as President: I will cut middle class taxes.  I will reduce the tax burden on small business. And I will roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over $200,000 a year, so we can invest in job creation, health care and education.        Read my lips: no new taxes!    Our education plan for a stronger America sets high standards and demands accountability from parents, teachers, and schools. It provides for smaller class sizes and treats teachers like the professionals they are. And it gives a tax credit to families for each and every year of college.     Huh.  Ok, this tax credit thing is only so helpful.  This kids who have the hardest time paying for college are the kids whose families have so little money that a tax credit won't mean anything.  Tax credits might help better off families and that's nice an all but what about the kid whose mom is on welfare?  Where's their chance at a higher education?    And we value health care that's affordable and accessible for all Americans.        By being willing to fight for socialized healthcare so that everyone can have it no matter how poor they are?       Our health care plan for a stronger America cracks down on the waste, greed, and abuse in our health care system and will save families up to $1,000 a year on their premiums.  You'll get to pick your own doctor and patients and doctors, not insurance company bureaucrats, will make medical decisions.  Under our plan, Medicare will negotiate lower drug prices for seniors. And all Americans will be able to buy less expensive prescription drugs from countries like Canada.         Oh.  Just kidding.  We'll just make insurance slightly less expensive and let you buy drugs from Canada.  Drugs from Canada?  Ok.  Look here, buddy.  Drugs from Canada (and if your Californian, Mexico) are not the answer.  The answer is to make drugs cheaper here.      Why are you campaigning on a dumbass workaround like this?  Where are my big ideas?     And when I'm President, America will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected it is a right for all Americans.      By letting you buy drugs from a country that actually values the healthcare of their citizens!  Seriously, people.  Offering the same healthcare plan members of Congress has to everyone is great but it does not solve the problem of people who can't afford insurance in the first place.  How are you gunna tell a Wal-mart employee to buy your insurance if they can't make the rent as it is?   (Cut all that crap about mid-east oil.  Yeah, it was a great line but I don't really care.)    And our energy plan for a stronger America will invest in new technologies and alternative fuels and the cars of the future -- so that no young American in uniform will ever be held hostage to our dependence on oil from the Middle East.       He wants to  urlLink burn more coal.   *hack*  *wheeze*    I've told you about our plans for the economy, for education, for health care, for energy independence.  I want you to know more about them.  So now I'm going to say something that Franklin Roosevelt could never have said in his acceptance speech:  go to johnkerry.com.       And get more non-information.  Seriously, I'm looking at the website right now and I'm not seeing a concrete plan here so much as expanded campaign rhetoric.  Ok.  I'm done.  I have more to say about this but this post is long enough as it is.  That man is long winded let me tell you.
