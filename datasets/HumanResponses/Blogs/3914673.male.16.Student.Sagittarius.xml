       NO .... NOT THAT YOU PERVERTED DUMB DUMB!   Its just that since i have been seriously working on something (many u guys know what) at nights my whole stupid schedule is re arranged. And when finally dad gives me a chance to set it straight, me like an eternal dumb dumb, which I am, spend my time on the WEB! (Aah well but WEB and Spiderman are related to each other ... :P) Stupid forums spree has got me STRUNG once again. I have already started to develop those wrinkles under my eyes. Havent slept at night properly for about 3 days now, and the thing that made it so easily possible is .. PANADOL EXTRA .. (I luva PANADOL!) !  On another  note, thankyou Talhasupremacy for honouring me in your blog and yeah for appreciating me as SPIDERMAN .. there are very few who understand .. :P .. lool .. !  Oh and yeah .. the new article is out baby ... and is not gonna last long .. only 3 more days .. Feast your eyes and (stupid) brains .. to the article on  urlLink http://www.mecampus.com  in the student news section!  Well now my (DONKEY) computer or mebbe DSL has started itching me once again for staying too long on it .. (coz when i do .. it refuses to upload any web page) Hence my only choice now is to Publish this post .. and sign off  Ma3salaam den

      Incase some of you dont know what SHOSHA is .. in japanese it means .. Winner! And gagaagagagagaggagagaggaggaaaa .. LOL .. Lanka kaheen ka.  According to the word of ear .. :P it was a nailbiting match right till the end, but anyways i need to air my thougts too. Srilanka .. shud have one,  agar they had used there top floor, or maybe they did, but not very effectively. Anyways, Pakistan is a lighter competition than India, I have to say, even though i am a paki. Now I seriously want India to win, so that Sri Lanka realize their stupid mistake of not letting the Paki's in, coz if we wud have been there, they had a chance, now, the road to victory is too narrow.  Anyways this is my opinion on my blog. If you have yours .. comment please..  Ma3salaam LuDa

      Salaamz / Hi people  Most of you'll freaks would be fully aware its gone gold .. Doom3 .. maan its amazing ..   The most intersting thing about the games previews is that JOHN CARMAK (the creator of the game) .. got scared himself playing it. Therefor your bound to get the creeps out of this one people, and if you dont then mebbe youre too old to be playing it and you have seen it all, or mebbe your gf/ bf is just as beautiful .. :P :D ... Any ways so much for that.   They just announce there Benchmarks .. and the people who played the game were stunned to see that it worked extraordinarily well, even on a G force 4 Mx 440 with 1.5 GHz Intel System!  Now thats golden for me baby, with a few bux my snail of a pc will be able to work it, like a horse in a race .. (inshALLAH) I hope so. And that is if the A levels dont chop my brains for total studay and no funneee... :(  Anyways Ma3salaam for now ..   LuDa ..   and yeah Doom 3's gone gold BABAY!

      Salaamz  Everything is just so happening this summer for me (Alhumdulillah), unlike the past others where boredom was the favorite pass time. Btw its 6 47 now .. and .. forget that clock under my post .. doesnt work .. hmm .. or maybe it does .. its set wrongly .. maybe .. :P .. hmm .. aah w/e the truth is i dont know how its set. &nbsp; Aah so .. where were we .. hmm .. all happening .. yeah .. Actually .. its so much that it feels like i am on a fast train, or mebbe I am a fast train and i dont know when will the tracks stop&nbsp;..  I have a few bleak conceptions, like ok .. I have to do this .. THEN .. and that THEN .. but when .. will this speed ride stop .. or .. crash (hopefully not :P) .. I dont know! ... DAMN YOU SPIDERMAN .. come save me .. :P&nbsp;.... hmm .. wait a sec .. I&nbsp;AM SPIDERMAN .. damn .. life can play tricks on you .. :P &nbsp; I like staying busy, and well I know I am gaining alot of experience points here.&nbsp;If the opportunity is good and legal .. grab hold I say, and well thats what i am doing now days, prolly thats the reason i am so stuffed all the time (not with food god damn it! .. with work ... and ... hmm play sometimes .. :P)  &nbsp; Any ways ... All i know is that i need&nbsp;rest .. and for some of the people who know what i am into .. will know why as well. But then, if i pause for rest .. i feel so bored .. coz there is nothing to rest onto ..&nbsp;and&nbsp;in the end i end up bored. So much for rest. &nbsp; Stoopid CS still doesnt go on low ping! I am kicked out all the time, with a very nice polite message, Sorry your ping is too high please try agan later. And in that sweet sorry i can see a smile/grin of some terrible idiot who thinks its so UBER COOL to kick me out .. grrrrr... &nbsp;238 - 300 latency .. I mean comon .. mein nay kya gunah kiya hai .. All&nbsp;I wanted to be was a terrorist .. (ALL PUNS INTENDED :P) &nbsp; And now out of the blue the PC starts functioning like a Donkey with ME&nbsp; sitting on it! ..&nbsp;Moreover, yesterday the net wasnt working .. proper .. and i had some real important assignments to send .. and ... well i was so pissed .. I slammed my mouse 2&nbsp;times .. and now i feel sad .. My&nbsp;intel 3.0 ... the one i bought from MY OWN&nbsp;MONEY&nbsp;!!&nbsp;(ok yeah .. it was second hand .. SO WHAT .. :P .. ?)&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyways, I&nbsp;feel so lazy ... and .. HEAVY&nbsp;( yeah .. VERY HEAVY .. :P) and i dont wanna do anything, but then i&nbsp;dont wanna be bored .. so i do something .. :P Oh man i am totally not making sense here .. Sorry&nbsp;to all you folks .. who have taken my nuisance .. and thank you as well .. In the end .. Alls cool . (I hope so) .. &nbsp; K den .. bouncin Ma3salam LuDa&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
