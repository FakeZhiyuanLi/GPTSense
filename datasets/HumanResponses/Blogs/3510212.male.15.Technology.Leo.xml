      Yep, I decided to create a blog :) Hmm, I guess I'll write down what happened earlier today..  I stayed up until midnight last night, so I slept in until 10 this morning. I woke up, had a banana, read the newspaper, then got on the computer to check my email and different forums. I saw a digital camera roughly equivelant to my first one that cost $80, for $18 shipped. My neighbor came over asking me if I could print out the windows XP logo (?), but my printer's black ink system is buggered, it's like a light grey. Did that before and after I changed the cartridge. Maybe I'll try cleaning the head assembly later.  I went over to my neighbor's house, then we went up to the mailboxes about 1/2 mile away (to the nearest paved road), and did some wheelies and stoppies on our bikes. That got boring, so we went back to his house, and I tryed tightening the chain on this old BMX bike he had lying around; I did but the gear on the front was bent, and he was about to throw it in the trash, so I asked if I could have it. He said sure, so we brought it over to my house and left it there. Then we went in and played tony hawk 3 for a bit, then went to his house to play atv offroad fury, then I came home.  Before I came inside, I tryed fixing the old bike a bit more. I got the gear straightened, and the chain tightened well, so I took it out for a spin. The chain came off when I really pushed the bike, but if I rode easy, it was fine.  Then I came inside, had food, went on the computer, watched TV for a bit, went back outside, rode around, hung out, blah.  After that, I came inside, watched part of some movie with my mom, had more snacks, had dinner, watched part of Diagnosis murder, then got back on the computer, and started this blog.  Tomorrow, I go in for my first day at my first job, at a local computer repair/retail shop called Alternative Computing Solutions. They said they'll start me at 7.00/hr, and I'll be doing part-time general computer repair, and apparently installing DSL and computer systems at people's homes (That'll be fun, having to walk around through town in the summer, or getting a ride...)  Anyway, I guess that's all for today.  -Jon Buder.

      Well, I was kind of busy the last couple days.   My first day at the new job went pretty well; I went on a service call with an older employee, then helped repair an old 90MHz doorstop when we got back from that.  My neighbor also got an ancient PC, his was only 75MHz. I tried to get it to work, but it needs a windows reinstall, and it won't boot from a CD, and when it boots from a disk, the monitor goes blank after POST.  Anyway...  The next day went pretty well too. I stayed in the shop, and worked on quite a few. I reinstalled windows 2000 on a laptop, got the printer to work on the same 90MHz PC, and started to reinstall 98 on another PC.  Right now, I'm about to go for a bike ride, then I'll go into work.
