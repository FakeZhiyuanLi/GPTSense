      I think royal is a good man. ALthough he may have some sharp eages. He is still afectionit, sometimes too much. Like when he went to kiss Mattie two time and first wanted to go and touch her breast and then go down her pants. But thank god Mattie stoped him . I really like it though because they seem  like they are meant to be. Because it was so cute when Royal told mattie that he had been looking at a ring for her and he found one,and how if he were to buy it would she mary him.  ANd she said " Yes ! !" Sometimes he may act really werid and too touchy but, thats how boys are sometimes.. You can't live with them you can't live without them.

      Through out out this chapter Mattie has read 2 letters. But now she feels  that grace brown is selfish and underhaned  because she feels is wondering why Grace brown gave her the letter to burn. Although, I have a question.. What if Grace Brown wanted Mattie to read them... for her to know about her afair with chareles?? And how she was pregnat.  Also why did Grace Brown give the letters to mattie and why couln't she burn them herself? The more Mattie reads the letters the more she finds out about Grace and may un clover clues to her death.

      1) I think that the beginning of theis chapter was really sad/depressing. Because in the beginning of it, drunking people beat up weaver and called him the N word! I really hate that. Also about how he wanted or was going to become a laywer and kick out all the people that were asalting him to jail. One more thing the part were Mattie tells Royal to forget about her was really a shoke and was sad.And For Minne too because of her house and how her breast are being eaten away.  2)It definetly gave me a nother side of Minnie's life and how she lives. It seems pretty bad.  3)My Ideas are the same..It may open a new way to show me more about the book, and what is going to happen.  1)I really agree with how Weaver wants to start his life over or change it in a way with getting out the whole racist issue.  2)I am Felling sorry towards Minnie's life : (  3)I want to know if Mattie wil go to visit Minnie more, Ans if Mattie and Royal will get married which i am wishing for  4)I know that back then it was very normal for children to have kids at a young age...some still do  5) I would loveto know if Mattie will get marrie dto Royal? And will they live happily ever after? - It will tell me more l8ta in the story
