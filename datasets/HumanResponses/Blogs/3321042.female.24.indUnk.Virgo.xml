      Sorry I've been slightly busy over the weekend, I came back to work yesterday but I had loads to do so I didn't have time to write.  I went to a barbeque on Saturday, it was at my friends house down the road, it was her boyfriends 21st.  We had a really good time and we all went into town together afterwards.  On Sunday I went to the Good Home Show at the NEC in Birmingham, we were there all day it was really good, I went with My mum's sister.  They were giving away loads of freebies and we had a couple of free glasses of martini!  I came back with bags and bags of stuff, and I'd hardly spent anything.  On Monday it was my Nana's funeral, it was nice to get it all over and done with.  Nearly all the family were there apart from the little ones.  We all went to the New Inn in Little Eaton for a few drinks and some food afterwards, Chris came along too, he managed to get the day off.  It was a lovely day the sun was shining all day, which made the day so much more bearable.

      I am sooo tired and so in need of a lie in.  The past couple of weeks have really done me in.  I have decided I need a treat so I'm going to the pub at lunch with the guys and we're all going to have a chip butty, forget the diet!!!!!!  I'm sat at work at the moment and the sun is shining directly onto my back, it's so nice, the only downside is that it makes my computer screen very difficult to see!

      Its Thursday, I am tired again, I didn't get my night in front of the telly as I planned yesterday, we got a phone call at tea time and it was my father in-law asking us out for a drink, so we went out for a couple.  My brother and sister in-law were there with our Neice Jessica.  Jessica's two going on 22, and a right little handful, but it's fun seeing her grow up.  I'm going swimming tonight after work, and then I definately have promised myself a night of doing very little apart from cooking the dinner.  I met my mum at lunch to go and organise the flowers for Nan' funeral on Monday.  I picked a posy with pink and burgandy flowers in it, it's small but effective.  I'm going to the good home show on Sunday with my aunty, i'm looking forward to that, I hope I'm not too hungover though cos we're at a 21st birthday party the night before!!!!!

      Chris really enjoyed his first day in his new job, he says it's very relaxing because he's not the manager.  He says he does want to be a manager again but this will be a nice break for him until something else comes up.  I had a fantastic game of squash last night with my friend Helena, I nearly won, and she says I am getting loads better.  I didn't have a great nights sleep though, I woke up at midnight to some screaming outside, I thought someone was being attacked so I ran to the window but all I could see was a fox, I wonder if it was that?  I keep forgetting that it's my Nana's funeral on Monday, it's been such a long time coming, I'm worried i'll get really upset again.  The good thing is Chris is able to come, his new boss has let him have Monday off, it'll be good to have his support.

      What a day I've been so busy, I don't feel like I've stopped all day.  Well I should sleep well tonight.  I'm going home in about ten minutes and I'm soooooooo ready.  I'm playing squash tonight at 8.40pm, it seems ages away, I'll have just got comfy in front of the telly by then!!!!!  I'm getting quite good at it now, even if I do say so myself.

      Well Chris has started his new job for now, he couldn't wait to get there.  It's great to see him happy again and his confidence in himself has reappeared.  He can't stand not having a job, he's never really been out of work before so it was an eye opener for him.  From now on we're going to have to be extra carefull with our money, I think what has happened will make us appreciate every little penny we have and it will make us think before we buy things.  I am so relieved everything has turned out for the best, I don't know how Chris would have coped if he's have been out of work for a long time.  I'm so happy happy happy!!!!!!!!!

      Chris has just phoned and told me that he may have a job to tide him over until a management position comes up at his old place.  He's got to pop and see this guy at three o'clock, so everyone keep everything crossed for him!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Well Chris is still without a job, but we are trying to stay positive.  He's applied for loads of positions so soon we should be hearing from some of them (Fingers crossed).  The weekend was ok, I did the race for life (See last post), Chris left the hot tap on in the bathroom for three hours on Saturday (I was not impressed).  We went to a BBQ at Chris's mum and dads yesterday, I was really tired though so I didn't enjoy it that much.  Anyway that was my weekend, not thrilling but OK.

      Well I completed the Race for Life yesterday, it only took us about 45 mins and I really enjoyed it, it was really hot so I got slightly sun burnt, but the great thing was that all the women were there for the same reason.  I have managed to raise Â£110.00 in sponsor money so that's great too.  I think we're going to do it again next year.

      Well today seems so much more bearable, Chris is still unemployed but relieved thet he hasn't got to go back to a job he really did not like.  I've just get to get him sorted with the internet looking for a job, he's not very confident at the moment.  So I think this weekend will be spent applying for loads of jobs.  I've got a big meeting this afternoon, I'm actually looking forward to it, but I'm going out for a couple of drinks at lunch to work myself up to it.  I've also got to cheer up my friend at work Mike, he's having a bad time of it at the moment, what with studying for some accountancy exams and work, he's always tired and sometimes he can be a bit off with me so I thought we'd go out for lunch and he can have a good moan about it all.  Anyway better go TTFN  Em

      Well things have not improved much, we've had to cancell signing for the new mortgage, but it's ok because we are able to put that off for six months.  I think we may end up not doing it at all, one of the only reasons we were doing it was so we could borrow some money on top of the mortgage to do up the kitchen, I think i'll live with the one i've got.  I nipped home to see Chris at lunch and he's really low, he's worried that people think or will think that he's no good at anything now, he's really had his confidence knocked.  I'm so angry with his bosses for making him feel this way, Chris feels like he's no good to me now he's not bringing any money in, and this is only the beginning.  What if he's out of work for weeks, what will that do to him?  Mum and Dad have said that they will help us if we need any money so that's nice of them, I think we can just about manage to pay the bills with my wages but that's all it will cover, that's not to mention things like food, petrol, the insurance on the car etc..... it all adds up.  Even if chris does get a job soon, there's no guarentee the money will be any near what he was getting.  I sort of wish it was me that lost the job, because I'm not the main breadwinner it wouldn't be such an issue, we would have got by just fine on Chris's wages.  I suppose I should be greatfull that I have got such a great job, but I wish Chris could have the same.  But as they say everything happens for a reason and I'm hoping that that's true and that in a few months time we look back and say that we're glad all this happened because Chris may have a better job that he really likes.  I hope all this makes our relationship stronger as well.  Anyway got to go  See ya

      Well they say it never rains it pours and they couldn't be more wrong at the moment.  Chris lost his job this morning and on the day we were due to sign for our new mortgage (Which was very dependant on Chris's wages).  I have done notheing but cry all morning, it's just a complete nightmare, and I am not coping very well at all.  I honestly don't know where to turn, Chris is my rock and now he's like a broken man.  Don't get me wrong he didn't love the job and it wasn't ideal for him, but having a job sometimes gives you the confidence to find another, Chris's confidence has been completely knocked.  He only started the job last year but it took alot for him to do that, the place he was at before was fine and he'd been there for 5 years and I think it was a case of better the devil you know, he was attracted to this job because the money was a bit better and that meant we could finally do all the things to the house that we've been wanting to do for ages.  So he left and started at this new place.  He seemed to be getting on well with them to start with, but after Christmas things started looking bad and they took a disliking to him, they kept preventing him from doing his job properly, then this morning they fired him.  They said it wasn't working out.  I don't get it, I don't understand how they cannot like Chris, what is there not to like?  But then i'm his wife!!!!  Anyway i'll let you know what happens, speak soon, em x

      I am doing the Race for Life this weekend for Cancer Research.  Funnily enough i'm looking forward to it, I don't always enjoy things like that, but it's only three miles and I've raised over Â£60.00 in sponsor money already.  It's come at a good time really, I'm going to race in memory of my Nan (you have a pink piece of paper on your back where you write the name of the person you're running in memory of).

      A little bored and still emotional from a bad weekend, my Nan died on Sunday, she's been ill for a long time, so in a way it's a relief but it's still sad.  The funeral isn't for another week or so yet, which isn't great as I think just as I'm getting over it all I have to go through it all again at the funeral.  I'm trying to remember all the good times, which is easy as Nan had her moments!!!!  Work have been really good about it all, I'm glad I work in such a nice place.  It sounds wierd but I'm sort of looking forward to the funeral, because I can see all my cousins.  I haven't seen some of them since me and Chris got married.  It seems to be that way now we've all grown up we only see each other at weddings and funerals!!!  Anyway better get on with some work  See ya

      We were so upset last night!  We just couldn't believe we were out!!!!!  But that was just the beginning of my upset for the night!  Me and Chris walked home after the match, we made it home for about 11, I sat on the door step whilst Chris had a fag and moaned about Beckham, then I noticed a shape next to my scooter on the drive.  At first I thought it was a bag or something, then I realised there was a person next to my bike!!!!!!  I asked what he was doing and he got up as if he was drunk and walked away then he got on another scooter and road off.  Me and Chris stood there in shock for a minute, then we decided to phone the police.  The police turned up, I told them that I thought he was trying to nick it, they took a statement and that was that......until this morning.  Luckily Chris was giving me a lift to work this morning because if I'd got on my scooter I could have had a very nasty accident.  They had actually been trying to steal the wheel off my scooter, they had undone some bolts and disconnected something to do with the breaks (to technical for me).  So i'm very glad I didn't get on it this morning, although I will have to pay a fortune for it to collected and fixed.  What a night!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      How mortified we were!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I went to watch the match at a friends house and we had so much hope (and beer!) we were convinced we would win.  What a shame.  All I've got now is a hangover!

      Well actually I was back at work yesterday, but I was so busy catching up on everything I forgot to log on!!!!!!  I had an absolutely mad weekend, I feel like I spent nearly all of it with children under the age of two.  I can definately say that it has put me off having children for the time being.  I was with my cousins little boy on saturday whilst she moved house.  Josh is so cute but very quiet and more interested in sitting back and watching what's going on around him than actually playing!!!  I took him to the park but he wasn't interested in going on any of the things so we walked and walked and walked......... It must have been good for me pushing a pushchair all that way!!  Lets hope I've lost a little weight.  On sunday it was my neice Jessica's 2nd birthday party, which seemed to consist of a small child screaming her head off untill she got what she wanted!!!  On Monday I went to visit my best friend Beanie, she normally lives in Ireland with her boyfriend and their little boy ben (6 Months) but she's back for a few weeks.  Another of my old school friends was there too and she had a little boy 3 months ago!!!  I feel like I am the only person on this earth with no baby!!! (not that that's a bad thing).  I did feel a bit out of place.  On tuesday I finally got some exclusively adult company, for part of the day at least.  Chris was off so we went to Megabowl, and did some unlimited bowling (I'm paying for it now, I ache all over).  Then we went to my brother in laws as it was Jessica's actual birthday (Yes that's right we have to go round twice!)  So that was my weekend!!!  I then had to come back to a pile of paperwork, and went home yesterday with a massive headache!!!!

      Work has been a complete nightmare over the past few days.  The phones were down on Tuesday (all Day) so we had very little contact with the outside world, we had to use our mobile and claim it back.  Anyway that wasn't the worst of it, because the phones were down it's put us back a few days.  I have gone home every night this week feeling emotionally drained.  I'm really looking forward to the weekend as I have also got Monday and Tuesday off.  I initially booked them of so I could get some house work done, but then I realised I've got so many other things to do the house work may have to wait.  I'm having my hair done on saturday in the morning, I have to be in the house on Saturday afternoon because my cousin is coming to pick some stuff up for her new place.  I'm at my friends mum's engagement party on Saturday night.  On sunday I'm at my neices 2nd birthday party.  Monday, I pretty much have the day to myself, but Chris is at work, it would have been nice to spend some time together!  Then Tuesday Chris is off but it's My neices actual birthday that day!!!  Yes that means we have to go and see her again.  Don't ask!!!!  She's the first baby in the family for a long time (Chris's side of the family) so a big fuss has to be made!!!!!  None of this will happen when we have kids, it sounds too much like hard work to me.  Maybe the excitement will have died down by then!!!!  So there we go, now you know in advance that if I don't post anything over the weekend it's because every spare moment I get will be spent sleeping or cleaning!!!!!

      Is tuesday, I've had a long weekend and a mad one.  I went out with everyone from work on Friday night, we went round a few bars in town and then onto one of the late bars and had a bit of a dance.  Apparently I was dancing all night!!!!!!  Well it definately felt like it the next morning.  I was so tired and I had a sore throat from all the shouting over the loud music!!  I stayed in on Saturday night, but that was when I got a strange text!!!  My cousin is married to another one of my cousins (all legal and above board, if a little strange)  Me and Chris sometimes meet them both for drinks with their little boy.  So I thought nothing of it when she texted me asking if we'd like to meet for a drink, but when I read the message more closely I realised it was all 'I' and 'Me' and not 'us' and 'we'.  so I text her back to ask if it was just  girly thing or if my other cousin was going to be there.  She told me it was just a girly thing.  Which in itself is strange because I can hardly remember meeting her on my own.  So I went round on my own on Sunday.  When I got there she told me that her and my other cousin are seperating because they have both been seeing other people!!!!!  Shock horror!!!!!  I thought these two people had such a strong relationship, because they had been through so much together proving that they loved each other because the family wasn't all for it!!!!!  I just couldn't believe it. So all in all it's been strange, I'm not sure what to do, because they are both my cousins, normally when people split up it means that you may not see one of them much at all, but I have to have contact with both of them because they are both my cousins.  Families hey!! Who'd have em!  Well no matter what I wouldn't be with out them!

      I have had a good weekend, partly because I didn't do much.&nbsp; I had my hair cut on Saturday morning which was a lot cheaper.&nbsp; My Hairdresser has gone mobile so it only cost me Â£15.00, that's about half the price it was!!! &nbsp; I Spent the rest of the day on Saturday on my own as Chris was working.&nbsp; I finally got to send some time with him yesterday, which was nice! &nbsp; It's now Monday, and it's back to work.&nbsp; But not for Chris, he's got the day off today,&nbsp;it's annoying being at work when he's off, but I suppose it's the same for him when I'm off.&nbsp; Next weekend he's working all weekend so I'll hardly see him at all.

      Again I am so ready for the weekend, still really tired though.&nbsp; Went to the gym last night and had a really good workout but I'm paying for it slightly now and I'm sure I'll feel it even more tomorrow.  &nbsp;  Going out for lunch soon with one of the guys from work, some of us always like to go out on a Friday for lunch, but there's only two of us going today.  &nbsp;  I think I'll be chilling out most of the weekend, my hairdresser's coming round tomorrow morning and then the weekend is my own, I think i'll do the garden if it's nice.

      I am so tired today, I could just fall asleep here and now and possibly sleep for a week.  I played squash last night, we didn't have th court booked until 9.20pm so by the time we were due to go i'd settled in front of the telly!  We had a fantastic few games though and I did win one of them.  When I got home I stayed up to watch Big Brother and then I kept the telly on till midnight, so I'm completely done in.  Work isn't getting any easier at the moment, the new contract stuff I'm doing seems never ending, I'm hoping it will be done in the next couple of weeks.  The insurance guy came to look at my bike yesterday and wrote it off, which is good news because now I don't have to worry about getting it fixed and selling it myself, also they are going to give me enough money to buy a new bike even though I don't want another one, so now we can have a break this year, we're thinking of going to Scarborough for a couple of days because we haven't been for three years.  So even though I'm tired today I'm in a reasonably good mood!

      I'm sorry I've not posted for a bit.  I've had such a lot on in the past few weeks.  Firstly, Chris has got a new Job, he seems to be enjoying it, and the place where he used to work have also offered him a job, so he's got some decisions to make.  Secondly, my scooter has been stolen.  I went out the other friday night, when I got back at two in the morning I didn't notice if it was there or not, I just went straight to bed, then when I woke on the saturday and looked out of the window it wasn't there.  I phoned the police and they caught a 15 year old riding it on saturday night, but they've wrecked it by the looks of it!!!!  It's quite upsetting because now I have to get lifts to and from work and I can't go to the gym until chris comes home which is sometimes gone 8pm.  So things have been pretty hectic on the home front, but work's mad at the moment, some new regulations have kicked in last week, so we've had to redo all the contracts (That's where I come in) I have spent hours on all this paperwork and still I can't see a light at the end of the tunnel!!!!!  I can't complain though really, because I do love my job, it's the best job I've ever had.  My brother is going to Afganistan either today or tomorrow for three months, so that's another worry, he was in iraq for three months last year and that was horrible not knowing how he was and waiting for his letters to come through, I'm hoping he'll be ok again this time.  He's looking forward to it, after all that is what he went in the army for.  Anyway I will keep posting and letting you know how my brother is getting on as and when I hear from him.

      Right, now I have time, I'll update you on what's been going on.  On monday I felt a bit strange, and I realised that my period was late, I didn't think that much of it as it has happened before!  Anyway I nipped to the chemist and picked up a couple of home tests, when I got back to work I thought I'd do one then.  Well, I didn't believe it at first, I called my friend from work to come and check it, she agreed with me that it was positive, then she burst into tears, at this point I was in shock, I didn't know what to think.  Then I realised I had told my mate before I'd told Chris.  I rang him straight away and he was over the moon.  I went to the doctors on Monday night, he told me that they don't do anything until 9 weeks, I'm about 5 weeks at the moment (We think).  But he said if my period was late and I'd done a positive test, then I'm definately pregnant!!!  Chris and I went to our parents that night and gave them the good news, they were all slightly shocked but all in all they are happy.  So here I am on Wednesday, and today is the first day I've felt sick, and boy did I feel sick this morning, I really struggled to eat anything this morning, but it's a little better now, I've managed to have some lunch, although not much, and what I did have was not exactly healthy!  I really ought to sort that out!  So there we go, Chris and I are going to be parents, it feels kind of wierd, we always said we'd do it one day, but not quite now.  I suppose we have to be greatful that Chris is back at a job he loves and that I'm in a secure job, and that my work will support me whatever my decision!
