      I am really so naughty...but in a nice way. Guilty of the former coz I skipped work to spend some quiet and intimate time with my partner. It was nice which I'm guilty as I'm charged. We slept till the sun was high and the birds stopped chirping. Poor her had to work till the wee hours and slept till late. I was awake early and had such a good time using the computer, which usually I don't have the 'permission' to go on for hours and hours. Nice. It was only me and the laptop, seems like I'm conquering the whole technology world (which I'm quite an I.T idiot)....hahaha!!! We took our own sweet time, like a typical old neighbourhood couple, roaming around, grocery shopping and exploring places. Though we did nothing much the whole day, but I believe that company counts a lot. I had a nice time, being simple, away from the hustle and bustle of orchard road. I hope that she felt the same kind of peacefulness  and fulfillment like I did. Sometimes in life, we chase after things we want and get so caught up with all that we simply have no time to stop and smell the roses. It may be insignificant to others but to me, it'll be a tiny sweet memory tugged away.

      Heard about this blog thingie  from a very dear friend. I was contemplating whether should I air my thoughts and inner feelings for the whole community to read about. Won't that be an invasion of my privacy? Perhaps...perhaps not. These pages of empty space will just be my witness on what my five senses (maybe six) could conjure up to report on a daily basis. There will be beautiful encounters as well as bad experiences that lurks at every turn or corners in my life. With the good comes the bad, too many experiences,so let me get connected to my inner self and let no one but me to trample on this 'holy grounds' of my own space and fairground. Let the thoughts begin to flow......

      My world is like a fairground Like every ride I would venture Mustering all courage within myself I face each day like a roller coaster ride Butterflies in my stomach? Perhaps like a tumbling washing machine? With the person next to me Strong arms holding me tightly Telling me that its alright Close my eyes if I'm scared, " I'll be here" Relax your body Let the ride envelopes you With trust I threw my all into the wind I put my everything into your hands Lying on your shoulders Gripping your hands tightly Holding on to my dear life Fear and Happiness washes through me Wishing that it would end coz of the former Wishing it to last forever coz I have you by my side Its not the destination that matters Its the journey and the one that rides with me that counts Where are you?... Will you?.... Please do

      Woke up feeling like I've slept for a thousand years, maybe that's how sleeping beauty slept, though pale to comparision...hee!! Didn't feel like doing anything today. One rest day a week is not enough, wicked employer tortures me a whole week and I get one lousy off day!! Have you ever have to make the choice of painting the town red versus having rejuvenating rest at home on that ONE precious rest day? How evil can it get, even when its my off day, I'll still have to fight the battle of making decisions, well...F*#k it!! I'm just gonna roll all over the house and not go out, month end is approaching and let's not waste more money hanging around Orchard watching the world go by. Look on the bright side, its my JUNK DAY...YUPEE!!! Once a week I gorgue myself with food, unhealthy, oily. fat induced, disgusting and 'to die for' kind of FOOD!! ( tongue hanging out) GET A GRIP MOO!!! Ironically, I don't have to spend much to have junk food in Singapore but healthy choices burns a hole in my pocket, now you know why I'm half empty till pay day...Jeez!! I'm eating prata as I speak...yummy, one with cheese and another with egg. Too bad my tummy's too small, so hard to stuff myself with all kind of yum-yum in just one day. Oh well, I'll have to wait till next sunday then. Bon Apetite!!!

      Its been such a long day, to begin with, had not much sleep the previous night to begin with. Frustrating job today took all the zest in me to live. In total I've probably worked more than 12 hours. Bollywood stars came to town and my company was doing a post party for them. Dealing with North Indians was excurciating, these people think a great deal of themselves, have their eyes and noses stuck on top of their freaking heads. I was extremely patronizing which is so unlike me, I probably could earn myself an oscar for being the most plastic door bitch in this universe...jeez!! Gf and her sis were a real gem, came down to keep me company for awhile, till I could sneak off at about 3am (party suppose to end at 6am). THANKS SWEETIE, THANKS ELLA!!! Hopped over to zouk for awhile but the 3 of us were dying of exhaustion,then decided to retreat home ( where love is, some say) I had to coordinate my limbs to take me into the shower, drag my battered body out of there and struggled to clothe myself. Poor sweetie crawled into the shower and crawled out with her eyes closed, poor thing. Hungry strikes, at the same time, slumber entices me...darn...this is mind boggling. Slowly and with half a mind left, I'll painstakingly finish this entry and roll into bed. Perhaps I can dream about food, then it'll not be all bad, I'll be getting my beauty sleep and having scrumptious food at the same time. Think happy thoughts moo, tomorrow will be a better day, its my well deserved OFF DAY...YUPEE!!! Good night cruel and real world.

      Why start to have doubts about yourself? why do you have the feeling that you're second best? Have I shown in my actions that you're not being loved enough? Have I let you down in some way? Please don't start to compare coz there's none existing to begin with. I love you as who you are, appreciate you in ways that words cannot define. The moments that we've shared were irreplaceable, you are irreplaceable. The capacity of appreciating others is bottomless, so is my love for you. There will be others that sees me thru my life, leaving footprints along the way, affecting me in other ways and senses that you may not. Please, do not think that you're not comparable, not good enough. It is just not the same, others affect me differently, like how you do, in a most unique way. Losing you one day will change my life totally and that would be the last thing I have in mind. Nothing and no one can ever come in between us, our bonding I view is that strong, that understanding and that trusty. Once again, I beg you, to love me, stay by me, trust me and never doubt the purity that bonds us.

      Sitting by the road in winter I ponder Are you missing me I wonder With the inconsistency of the weather Did loving me ever matter All the memories that we've created Falling over me like petals in the snow   Birds start chirping Soaring high in spring time sky Like a fresh beginning  It is time of praises and rejoining Window of my heart's ajar Waiting for you, near or far   Looking up in the blue sky in summer Children playing about in clutters Happy faces and the innocence they render Is our love like that? Pure and simple Images I try to find, like the sun I want to shine Engulf me with passion Nothing else, only this notion  Time stood still,  Autumn came You're still not here, how I blame Leaves falling around me Like dead and sad memories That you left embedded in me Why? I ask, that you can be true heartless Walking away like you must Just waiting for the cold wind Ending us like a dream

      Besides my own family, I have two very special siblings that I share my life with. They bring laughter and joy to my life, filling up empty voids with beautiful memories that money cannot buy. When pain and suffering undertake them, it hurts me most and brings tears to my eyes. Tall and as beautiful as an angel one is, sharing all my heartaches and deepest secrets. Always my little baby that I could seek positive energy from and being emotional tofus together. Boys brought tears to our eyes but we were always there for each other to make things better. To know that the next morning would be a day of goodness coz of each other's will to be happy and comfort in one another. She's young, but just in numbers. She's my princess and nobody can ever take her place, she's mine and mine only. With a heart of gold and the best listener I say about the other, people around seeks the pleasure of sight and only adores beautiful things around them. This other sister of mine doesn't appeal to many in sight, but to me, I woulden't want her in any other way. Its not true that ' good things come in small packages', my little Zhumei stands out differently and confidently of her own. Another individual that doesn't take crap from others and firmly believes in herself. I love the two of you deeply and truly. Although we are all victims of emotions and relationships, but as long as we stick together, the sun will still shine brightly when we wake. Do not let others make us feel small, make us feel unworthy to be loved or to love. We're like the  three charmed sisters on telly. One major difference is that we're not a show that would come an end. What we have binds us so tightly that it'll last for eternity. Thank you so much for loving me, for being here for me when my life doesn't make sense. Now I understands why god made me the youngest in my own family, because he had sent two guardian angels to be called my own, to be called my sisters when I face the tough and unpredictable world outside. In my prayers every night, I pray for your good health and that god would only have the best in stored for the both of you, nothing less but always more. Perfection in whatever you come upon...love...family...career...friends and most importantly, appreciating yourselves.

      It was nice seeing you last night, I felt warm and electrified when you put your arms around me and our hearts connected. Though we were apart for the longest time since we knew each other but that didn't hold me back of holding you. Maybe that's how friends/sisters are meant to be, no fuss with words, actions speak louder than words, they say. I feel happy and sad when I saw you. Happy coz I missed you so much and sad coz I was told that you're single. You must be feeling like crap and still trying to pretend that you're strong. Even though we don't have the chance to meet up so often or talk on the phone anymore, but that doesn't mean that I don't love you or care about your well-being. In fact, I do and at times, I feel that you're pushing me away, that you're putting up a fence. Please don't misunderstand that I see you as a lesser companion now that I'm with someone else. All of you are different. It hurts me to know that you're keeping to yourself or trying so hard to stand on your own, denying everyone around you. If you think you'd know me well enough, then, please know that I care and adore you. I don't want you to go away or see you any lesser than we are already. I pray that you'll hear my pleas and know where I'm coming from my dear.

      Many people don't understand the meaning of friendship. True friends don't have to be around each other 24/7, they don't have to keep trying to impress each other or appear sympathetic when they don't really mean it. The older one gets, the lesser friends we've got. Its not the quantity that counts but the quality. I've got a few friends that can be called buddies and even soul mates. We don't have to see one another for the longest time or spend every waking moment together. True friends can be apart for the longest time but when they get together, they can talk till the cows come home. They can open up to each other with the most intimate details like their life depends on it, and feel most at ease. I haven't seen SM for the longest time, more than 8 months at least and yet I miss her everyday and messages her once a while. Still there's that connection and she's still my true friend. Thanks to all my friends that stuck around me, to guide me and be my pillar of strength when I'm in the dumps. Valerie, Jo, Pig, Zhumei, SM, Chris and Sean. With your kind understanding and support, I know that my life is still worth living for. Though we may have our differences at times, but we stick by each other. Friendship to me is many things that I cannot describe with words, its the warm feeling I get when I'm with them that makes it all worthwhile. Its the lessons of life that they can teach me and make me a better person. Thank you from the bottom of my heart and please do not let the distance and differences keep us apart. I love each one of you and all of you have a very special place in me that I keep locked away.

      I'm sorry for blowing things out of proportion. I don't know what got into me but the worst happened. Its our first fight and there's much to learn from it. Not knowing each other's raging temper hormones made things worse. I'm short tempered, very short indeed, and pride got in the way. Someone has to take the first step back, I didn't, neither did you. I needed to get out of the house, the tension was raising and I could no longer suppress the anger and fume I had in me. If I would have stayed on, things would have been uglier. I sat downstairs waiting or hoping that you'll call. Probably not your style and it most certainly not mine to make the first move, but I did. After settling down and taking deep breathes, I calmed down and thought things thru. Its my fault and I think its big to admit one's fault when one commits it. After much waiting, you didn't call and I went home, realizing that probably you didn't care as much as I think you did. I'm sorry I didn't handle it like I should, I lost it. It made me feel bad, like whatever I portrayed in the last few months didn't mean a thing. I should be bigger, wiser and less childish, how different am I from an 18 year old. Nobody says a relationship is a bed of roses or it will be plain sailing all the time. It will have its ups and down, happy and sad moments. All I'm hoping is that our next fight would be of more substance and grounds.

      Been a few days since my last entry, work is crazy. not enough girls to spread around. With outside catering, girl on leave, grand opening at Wisma and preparing for anytime that the girls will stood me up is all driving me nuts. I'll have to plan my week out carefully in order to fit in everything- work, gym, partner and maybe (by the grace of god) some private time.  Not exactly feeling great coz I'm not feeling good about myself. Been lately having comments that I've put on weight. Gosh!! My world is crashing in, how did that happened? Like what people say " If you don't look good, you don't feel good". How true. I've gotta stick to the program again, its gonna be tough coz I've been slacking, but I have to. People have seen the better side of me and now if I don't measure up to it, I'm so gone. Please give me the strength to accomplish it. Totally different life-style now, and I let myself succumb to it, what a stupid idiot I am. Sorry, I promised you that I'll not slack and look like crap, but I think I can qualify as crap now. My confidence and moral's rather low and     I've only got myself to depend on to pick it up, not like in the past. I'll do it, for my sake, I will. Wish me luck...and lots of hard work.

      "FAMILY". A very important word. Life begins with just this insignificant little word that bares such great depth. Without our parents, there is sub-zero possibility of having us (children). However, what defines "good parents"? Those who stick by each other, love their children and induces the best values for their next generation? Unfortunately, I come from a broken family. Daddy's not around but by the side of half sisters whom blindly took away the fatherly love that I once had at a tender age. A mother that is very dear to me but often taken for granted by my siblings and I. Was supplements of material needs one form of  making up for the lost of a father figure? Was a few words of care and concern enough to make up for the times that he misses out on the important events that moulds our future? Leaving a wife that has to take on a fatherly and motherly role most of my life. Enduring all the awkward questions that relatives and friends  buries on her. No partner to share life's bittersweet. My poor mother. I'm not one that stays at home or render the best company to her. I am ashamed of myself, I remind myself from time to time that she's a wonderful woman with too much pent up sorrow and anger with no outlet. I cannot blame her for lashing  out on us but at the same time I do. My rebellious and stubborn nature makes me unable to yield to defeat, I'm sure I've hurt my mom zillion of times but she loves me all the same. Daddy... how I miss you. I am unable to convey my thoughts and questions of living my life to you. Once I am of age, you are long gone, communication and connection came to a permanent halt. Not knowing your children must be one of your greatest regret in life. Not knowing you...? Is that my regret or blessing. I do not hate you, I do not have many fond memories because I was too young to collect any. I pray that the short-lived years you played father to me serves you well and good. I hope that you live healthily and at peace. Perhaps how I am today has something to do with your absence. I am incomplete and never will be able to live thru your legacy and be influenced by your greatness, intelligence and wits. I am merely just one of your daughters that you never knew.

       Disturbing dreams woke me up so suddenly, it felt weird. It feels like this is one part of me that I cannot be in control of. Seems like my weight problem isn't the only thing that I'm losing control of. The vacuum space of floating images and characters in my dreams are thoughts that I think about during the day that reflects at night( that's what people say). Very mind-disturbing to be tormented even during my slumber. I often wonder what dreams are really trying to say. Is it a past memory that I've not completed? Is it depicting my future? Am I missing something or someone too much, thus its haunting me while I sleep? Guess I'll have something to do while going about my day, my thoughts wondering aimlessly, not able to put a finger on the dreams that fills me at night. Is that how my life is going to be as well...aimlessly.

      The sounds of soothing classic music Fills my heart and invades my thoughts Every note and crescendo of tunes Erects inner feelings that are hard to release Feelings kept locked away, haunting memories Evoking all my senses, runs through my veins Bittersweet images Some tugs at heartstrings Others,beckon to be forgotten  Am I living in the past Letting it once again engulf me Hitting me hard  Solid like every musical note Strumming and Drumming Till the end of each piece Like every of my heartbeat Alive with each note Massive waves Sweeping thru my body  What my future beholds Composing with effort  My next piece of music Soothing and surreal Only I holds the power Creating each new memory Like Extraordinary momentum Chains of beautiful notes Completing my masterpiece  Once again, I play on Feeling and sensing The strength and empowerment Allowing me to go on To be strong and alive My life prevails, my dreams go on

      Its been 5 days since my last entry and still I'm feeling lower than a caterpillar's belly about the way I look and fighting the battle of being weighty. Often I would suggest friends who have the same problem to ' get down and do something about it...no pain, no gain'. Now when I'm facing the same problem, it irks me to see that the effort and change is too slow or non existence at all.  How frustrating it is, perhaps I need a good slap in the face to wake me up and smell the urgency of being skin deep once more. It seems that the harder I try, the more pressure I allocate to myself and there's when the food monster will come get me. Perhaps its the stress I'm undertaking at work lately, perhaps its the company that I'm keeping...perhaps its everything. Its all excuses moo...WAKE UP!!! I urge my friends around me to please lament the fat fact in my face each time you see me, so I'll strive to work harder. People all around are just too skin deep, they've seen the better side of me, and the expectation of keeping up with it its always there. Don't get me wrong, I'm not doing this for anyone, its just sheer vanity that's talkin. I'm being tolled underwater coz of this and probably will not surface till everything gets better. Don't tell me its alright and you'll still love me the same no matter what, the case here is, I CAN'T EVEN LOVE MYSELF!! Wish me luck and drill me till the day I become a butterfly again, for now, I'm a hermit crab...a fat and ugly hermit.

      Darn proud of myself, if you were here with me, you'll be patting me and telling me how proud you are of me. Went to East Coast with Monic and a few of her friends. Some of us took up the challenge of taking a 3.5 click jog/run. I managed the to and fro journey with no stops in between. I was sweating like a horse but it was worth every drop of perspiration. Running outdoors is really so different compared to the treadmill, ten times harder. I'm sure I can complete it faster given a few times more practice. It felt wonderful and a sense of achievement when I was done running, I ran like Forest Gump, I ran as fast as my feet can take me and with thoughts of you in my mind. I feel confidence creeping back in slowly but surely, I'm not far from the finishing point, wait for me, I'm on my way.

      Its back to the basic 'military style' training for my diet and workout routine. Just like one and a half years ago when I was still a sack of potatoes. Now I truly understand the rigidness and toughness of keeping with the program, once you're off course, its damn difficult to revive it. I'm still struggling at the gym, sticking with the schedule and strict eating habits. Everyday I wake up feeling lousy and seriously, I'm tired of being this way. How could I be so stupid and throw all that I've accomplished to the wind. Now I've got to start from scratch again. Everywhere I go now, its no longer positive comments but only ' Oh wendy, what happened! you've put on weight'. Isn't that annoying and sad. It just shows how visible the gain is. I'm giving myself till the end of July to lose the extra kilos and start living again. At the meantime, I'm under construction...MAJOR construction!!!

      Sunday was quite a blast.. literately speaking in fact. What got blasted? My skin. Was at the beach most of the day and the sun was scorching. However, it was well worth it. It took a little persuasion and a bit of courage to dawn my swim-wear and parade nearly naked in the presence of many people. I am having an internal battle with my weight problem, remember? Thankfully, the beach ( East Coast) was crawling with people, guess nobody would notice an insignificant me. Then again, given the choice, I would rather be at sunset bay any day compared to East Coast. Too crowded, too many families with screaming children and too loser-ville for me. Afterall, its not that bad an experience. The last time I was there was about 9 years ago, not kidding. I must say that the facilities and amenities had grown leaps and bounds, I am rather impressed. Still the people irks me. I did the whole tanning ritual ( half hour belly up, half hour belly down and another half belly up again). My tan came out beautifully, was sweating like a horse though, but well worth it. HAHAHA...I'm toasted wholemeal bread once again, give me another session under the sun and I'll be PERFECT!! Wait a little while more, I'll be gracing sunset bay once again after I get my weight down and installed with self confidence, I will again sweep the beaches at Sentosa...patience my lovely beaches, my gorgeous babes and hunks and ever smashing hot sunshine ...Moo'll be back real soon...WHAHAHAHA!!!

      Sometimes I think we're a mismatch Sometimes I don't understand you Sometimes you make me wonder Sometimes it is tiring Sometimes mind disturbing   Why do you ask many questions Why do you not like talking about my past Why are there doubts Why are there insecurities Why must it be frustrating Why must there be tears Why must there be discord  Is it you or just me that is making things difficult Am I asking for too much or are you expecting more I question myself  I burden myself  Who am I What I want Am I not doing enough Maybe not lovable Perhaps its the bad moments that evoke ill thoughts I'm certain that we don't need all these extra burden We've survived enough broken heartaches   Let's just make peace Let's just have fun Let's not spilt hairs Let's not compare notes Let's try to share Not engulf in their own life Coz life no longer only contains one  Please...let's just....

      Where should I start with this entry? There had been so much going on for the past two days that I hardly know where to begin.  Zouk was a blast, I danced the night away, perhaps more so compared to you ( heehee). Can't really blame you coz you had the most tiring first few days at work. Think you're facing the computer more often than seeing me, stupid piece of machine, taking away more of your attention than I do *jealous*. Then again, Told myself that I'll have to be slightly more patient with you coz your job is one hell of a pain in the arse. However, it pays the bills and put food on the table. Appreciate your effort of wrapping up work early and making it possible to be at Zouk.  I had a really tiring Thursday as well, thought I coulden't make it to Zouk in one piece. Gosh!! Its was crazy at work. All those miles that I've travelled running about with so much errands at hand. With no regrets to be at Zouk, not so much for the Femme Quest but a good time to catch up with old friends. The biggest perk was seeing my sis there. Have not partied with her in ages and we had so much fun. Damn!! she looks hot too, well, more room for improvement but still fine. Met her other half and I am happy that she found someone she likes. Suddenly, the world made sense for her again. I hope you had a good time too and thanks for looking out for me coz I was half gone and sweet of you not to take the chance to get fresh with anyone ( heehee). Though I was a little troubled when your ex kept hanging around, but its alright, I should at least have that much faith in you. Had a few too many to drink, all in the name of good fun but a little too much. Woke up the next morning still smelling like a distillery and a bad hangover. Getting to work was a drag, barely made it thru. Feet hurts like a son of a bitch, that really was the core. Then when night fell, meeting you made everything better. Though I had to wait ( again) for you but seeing you descend like an angel in front of me made most of the unpleasantness go away. Still the feet were throbbing with pain. It was nice, a little quiet time. Nothing loud or complicated as you know I don't like fuss and after a night at Zouk, being among many people doesn't sound appealing. Thanks for the company, it was good. I had fun, hope you did too.

      People come and go in our lives Past is not something to dwell on With no past The present will be bleak Let alone a future to depend on  I hardly say I thank you I hardly make you feel special I discounted you coz I'm afraid I discounted us coz I'm too tired  Nightmares haunts me Refusing me a chance to gamble Efforts of building becomes a letdown Eventually everything I touch becomes stone Life takes me for a ride Steals my precious Leaves me with nothing   Let it be no more Hiding and dodging To reach the end of the rainbow Perhaps its a long journey But I'm glad you're walking with me I thank you once again For your love, patience and care For the everlasting effort To reach the pot of gold

      Nothing left between us  Only words of encouragement Blessing from so real within Pages of thoughts and feelings Binding our past so tight Mercilessly voiding a future together Perhaps its not meant to be Perhaps its all but a dream A rude awakening Evolving into life's worst nightmare  Without your presence I would have never learnt Without your harsh words I would have never succeeded With your absence, now life made sense  You gave me a chance to stand on my own Being independent, knowing that I'm strong Breathing for you no longer Living for you no more Only God willing That life will be for once All about myself  My truest blessings be with you My deepest gartitude for teaching me right My aspiring dream to see you well That life is treating you fine You were everything that I was Now I carry on my life without you Hoping to be nothing less than yourself  My friend My family My mentor I honour you

      Tiring day. While others enjoy the leisure weekend with loved ones and relaxing their stress soaked bodies, Its still work for people like me. In the F&B line, I guess weekends are not something sweet to conjure up. Did an outside catering at Sembawang today, jeez... do you have any idea how far that place is? It is some God forsaken piece of territory that a regular joe doesn't ever visit. It seems nearby, there's where the prison training school is. The catering was for The American Association in conjunction  with the 4th of July ( America's Independent Day). I worked to my bones and perhaps suffering from old age, my body is calling out for help now. After a long, soothing shower, I feel much better now. Tomorrow's a good day, its my off day. Just one day is too short and I'm too brain dead to think of what to do tomorrow. I'd probably just waste the day away, bask in the sun a little with a nice storybook and a cool drink in hand. I hope that all workaholics will enjoy some peace of mind like I will on a nice relaxing sunday. Come Monday, we'll face the horrid world again. Sometimes living day by day isn't that bad I reckon.

      I'm sad that you've left, I'm sorry that I can't do much to help. I'm guilt-stricken that I've lost you to the unfair jurisdiction of those imbeciles. I don't mind the extra work that now befalls on me, I can live with the stares and gossips going around the company. Neither are they true nor important. What I seem to not be able to live with is without your presence. The times we sit for hours to brainstorm on matters, the bitching sessions and cynical laughters that we've shared. You're my right-hand man, my watermelon and my friend. I curse those who speak ill of you, I curse those who got you into this fix and I curse those who are rejoicing at your absence. I will still guard our fort, still train and treat right our 'soldiers' and make sure our flag rise high and proud. For the both of us, and all of the girls, I will try my best and bring glory and respect to the team. I miss you.

      Everlasting is nothing but fairytales that we would like to believe that exist on this earth, maybe in our lifetime we wish. With the harsh reality thrown to us like unstoppable fireballs, how could we stop for a second and let our heart rule over our mind. Others whisper sweet-nothings and promises that seems too good to be true. With the purest and depth of their love they standby, with hopes and dreams of a future they cooed. We fall from high above, wrecking our hearts and smashing our dreams. What future? What forever? All thrown to the passing wind that once carried us on its back, full of enthusiasm and delight. All that's left will just be hard piercing rain that cuts us like a knife. Slicing thru the wholesomeness, banishing all thoughts of heart-warming rights. I beckon all to look pass the visage of attaining perfection, to be weary like bees to honey. Perhaps its not our virgin attempt of falling in love, perhaps its not our virgin attempt to try. Still, there's only one heart, our heart that's hurting and probably never be able to function like the virgin time when we knew what love was all about. How it felt, like the first ray of sun light and the softness of a baby's skin. So I beckon again to think before we leap and not fall with at least a little restrain to this thing easily called 'love'.

       Perhaps the times of loneliness was too lengthy, succumbing to it once you've found 'love'. You imagine that she's a God-sent,  I pray that the angels will open your eyes and your mind to read people clearer. I worry about you, slipping too deep, too fast. You're my precious and seeing another making a mickey out of you worries me to the core. What can I do? I constantly ask myself. How do I protect people who are so dear in my life? I am but a bystander, outside of the equation, probably with a simpler overview of what's happening all around. It is not my biggest wish to smash your hopes and dreams, but a negative feeling just grows within. I'm afraid to relate to you how I feel coz you might not be able to hear me, using your heart that is. Your heart is now dominated by a stronger force, I just hope I don't lose grounds with you. Please do not be blinded by what seems to be 'love'. Please take a minute out and apprehend the situation. Perhaps there are things that I know but you don't comprehend. I did not raise you to be oblivious, I did not induce teachings in you to be thrown into the wind. I know I cannot do much and I won't. I won't be cruel to crush your perception, neither will I be the catalyst of any downfall. Only can I pray that you're blessed with all the love in this world and maintain a clear mind that perhaps can overrule the feelings of your heart at times. In the grace of God I will just silently pray.

      oh my little zhumei, where have you gone to? Its been 2 days since you wrote anything on your blog and I worry. It has become an addictive habit of reading about your life since I cannot always be by your side. Now that you've stop writing for the last 48 hours, you seem to have cut away my oxygen supply. I hope everything's alright and will still look out daily for your entries. I miss you.

      The work problems on hand is still the biggest hurdle I'm facing now. Still sitting in the office with neverending paperwork to wrestle with is not helping a weak-minded person like me. Today is really mind boogling, with problems after problems coming up like sprouting of weeds. Its burrowing on me till I can hardly breathe. I know a week ago that its going to be tough, but never in my wildest dreams to know that its this tough. My confidence and will has been beaten down over and over again. I fear that I'll have to raise my hands in defeat, to acknowledge the fact that I've failed. I wish for Sunday to come quickly, being my off day, that's the only time I can cast the official blunders and worries to the wind. The boss is coming back from KL tomorrow,sigh, more questions and bombarding that'll take place. Guess I'll have to worry about that when the time comes. I'm so drained that I'm not even affected to know that the boss is coming back. Jeez!! I so need to get away from work. The only consolation was to hear that familiar voice over the phone after such a hard day. Nice to know that at least there is someone to run to at the end of the day, comforting and securing arms. Though we have our own problems at work, but least we can run into each other's arms for comfort and protection. Thanks luv!!

      Job has taken a major toll of my life. Subconsciously I worry about it till its affecting my slumber. I spend the whole night tossing and turning, slipping in and out of sleep. Not only about work but also about fitting my personal life into its busy and stressful grasp. What about gym? What about Jo? What about my friends? Perhaps I'll have to keep my priorities right, deal with it one at a time. With the authority I posses at work, the fair share of responsibilities strings along. Please understand that I do not wish to talk about work and its problems after work. I know that you're trying to fit in, trying your best to understand. Along the way, naturally if you do, then you do. It gets a little frustrated telling you the problems and I'll have to explain the break down of the scenario further which I'm not in the state of mind too. I'm sorry if I'm sounding a little too harsh, I do not mean it that way. Really I do appreciate the effort of your involvement but not at times when I'm so drained that I find it taxing to even breath, literately. Which is most of the time since now Brandi's gone. When we have moments together, I'll be happy to listen to your problems at work rather than discussing about mine. That we can build more personal memories with our friends and joyful things we do, not circling around our jobs which takes up more than half of the day. Hopefully this bad saga of mine will pass quite soon and things will get lighter on my side, then we'll be less agitated with each other. I apologies for getting cranky and short tempered, I'll try to be more patient even when I'm feeling tired as a dog. Hopefully, we'll stop rubbing each other the wrong way anymore.

      Now that I've realized not only MY past haunts me but YOURS too. Perhaps I've bitten off more than I can chew. Perhaps I'm not as strong as I'm portraying. I am but only human, but only a woman that posses the high caliber of being emotional unbalanced or falling into the pits of jealousy. Its not right to dwell in the past, then again I cannot help having flashes of what I've seen. You can deem it as a silly thing to hang on. However, if I weren't affected at all, does it mean that I have not rendered any feelings towards you at all? I would very much like to shake off this negative feeling but the flashbacks are thought provoking. I'll try my best not to be affected, I'll try to be grow up about it. All I need is a little time and understanding.

      When we have it, we don't cherish it When we lose it, we blame heaven and earth We take for granted of what we have till we lose it We get all red eyed when others posses what we once had We forget the plain beauty of the touch and caress of the other Would we hold on to it if we ever have the chance again Would we dare tread on danger waters again Would we dare to toy with fate again There are so many 'what ifs' There are too many memories May we keep them tightly within our hearts May we be glad that we once bloom and lived Memories are just what it suggest and says Let it be water under the bridge Let it just be a distant reminder To have a better and more beautiful life ahead

      I think she's everything rolled into one. Sometimes a bundle of laughter, other times much of a handful. Like a roller coster ride, she's rather unpredictable, yet again she seems easy to read. Looking at her reminds me of the child within, perhaps I've missed out a big chunk of it during mine. With each attempt of being bubbly and cheerful, makes me think to myself " have I done that before?" Probably its the lacking of such carefree character that made me into a person like I am now. Where was my childhood? When was the last time I threw my hands up and let my hair down? How is it possible that I grew up so fast and too furious that I forgot my last innocent and pure laughter? Looking at her made me feel old, too burden and too serious. Then again, isn't this life? That we must leave all simple and plain memories to be just memories. Innocence was long gone, perhaps about 12 years ago. The only thing which is tangible now is the 40 odd years ahead where life is too fast and too real. But its nice to have her around, as a remembrance that I once lived like such. I had my moment.

      Dear Lord Almighty, I pray with sincerity in my heart, for you to take away the subtle but nagging pain that is tormenting monica. I may not be worthy to praise your name coz I render myself a fallen angel that has long left your side. With whatever goodness that is left in me, I pray for your forgiveness for our sins and the many teachings that we turn away or choose to ignore in our daily lives. With the vastness of your heart and the undying love that you bestow upon us, your children, we pray that you'll guide us in our weakest moments. Watch over us with your patient like lost lambs over the open fields. Take away all the evil that torments Monica and bless her with peace, pureness and love. let her rest well and spread your goodness the next day and many days ahead of her. In you precious name I pray....Amen!!

      There are days when I feel moodless and I think today can be rendered one of those days. I wish that I can be stuck under the covers and not face the world or converse with anyone. If it is possible, I'd probably would call in sick, but I can't. To friends out there, my apologizes to you if you do not get prompt replies on the sms or constructive conversations with me for the day. Hopefully, the day will end sooner than later and perhaps tomorrow will be a better day. Moodless moo.

      People often take for granted what God has given to them from the beginning. The heartaches and haunting nightmares only slowly seeps in when the love ones and favorite  things get left behind or taken away. I've only roam this earth for a very short period of time, not experiencing the full agenda that is made out for me. Yet I feel the heavy mile stones in every step of the way, dragging me down like a hundred ton of anchor to shore. I find the strength to raise to the top, to take in the fresh air and beautiful sunlight that nature has provided. I find in me the memories and daily challenges to fight on. Loved ones by my side and the subtle reminders of bliss around me brace me for the wake in the mornings. The sounds of encouragements, the surreal portion in my head I seek comfort in, the soft whispers of promises and faith tugs at my heartstrings enables me to raise to the occasion each time, every waking hour. Telling myself constantly that life is how I want to make it out to be. With no one we should trust, no one to depend on, but only the will to become better. Like an ugly duckling to a beautiful swan, a caterpillar to a ravishing butterfly, a stubborn calf to a adorable moo. These things I promise to myself.

      Its only been a couple of months that fate brought us together, perhaps things always happens for a reason, in this instance too. We shared laughter, anger, crazy times and tears and perhaps more to come.  Slowly, we should synchronize  our foot steps, our heartbeats and our wave-length. However, what you said last night at Zouk did cut me like a knife. Lightly but surely, I can feel the discomfort. I am not angry anymore, just a little disappointed but it has blown over. I may not be as matured or old as the other, I may not beat the crap out of the party that tries to bring you down or spear words of attack when there wasn't anyone to target on. Neither did I think the matter was grave enough to throw the first punch. I may appear 'chicken shit' or ' ball-less' to you. Personally, I think I'm matured enough not to make a scene in public till its rightfully necessary. I can bleed for you, cry for you and protect you when the time calls for, but not raving like a 15 year old that doesn't have a commendable  composure or a tight head screwed on. If you think the lesser of me, I will not defend myself coz there is no need to. I clearly know who I am and what I am capable of, which is not public embarrassment at least. Please do not get upset after reading this, as writing my blog is one of the few options of emotion outlets I have. Let's try and keep an open mind in the future and not lose our cool so easily. -It takes a bigger man to walk away then to throw the first punch-

      I am told that one cannot fight everyone's battle. That means at times I would have to ride with the wind and blend in. Whether its work, family, friends or relationships. It drains me to try and understand sometimes, and try to tell myself that its alright. I'm a fighter, I have grown up to be level headed and matured, very matured, I woulden't deny. I may have my childish moments and I hope that is not overpowering. I will not let myself be span round any fingers, worship the grounds that were trampled on. Giving too much did not bring me anything in the past and I've learned my lesson from then. I am only hoping for space in between to compromise. I am not difficult to live with. Neither am I one that portrays great emotions and speaks aloud. My preference is subtle, yet speak volume. I do not appreciate loudness, false pretense and forced intellectuals. These do not impress me, on the contrary, it pushes me away, making me shut many doors in the process. Perhaps I'm not as chripy like the day, perhaps I'm most comfortable like the night, fitting like a pair of gloves with the darkness. This is just me, no sudden changes, no hidden identity. I am the same person with all, that might sound a little harsh and hard, but least I'm so with everyone. It is just me, what you see is what you get.
