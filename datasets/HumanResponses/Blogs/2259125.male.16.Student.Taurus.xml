      It has a lot of holes and is not entirely complete but it is still okay.  It is nothing near the quality of a school essay.  Of course I am right.  Everyone, at one point or another, witnesses the stereotypical kindergartener’s argument whether it is over equipment, rules of a game, or whether they scored or not.  It always seems to follow out the same way. "Yeah huh," "No!" "Yeah, my daddy said so!" However, do we really grow out of pointless arguing?  It seems that no matter how mature we supposedly become, our arguments will forever remain either unnecessary or utterly pointless.  I will demonstrate that the majority of arguments are results of issues that could otherwise be avoided.  For example, pride, or the inability to admit you are wrong causes a multitude of unnecessary arguments.  Such as when we choose to not even consider another’s point of view; naturally assuming that we are right.  The argument at this moment is void, since no progress will be made toward influencing either of the individuals.  An effort must be made to at least explore the opposing participants case; at which point if the case is deemed valid in our mind, we must concede, if only part of the argument.  If, however, we find the person’s case true and continue to debate them, then we are simply arguing for the sake of dispute and are much like the children on the playground.  In the same way, bad communication, or lack of understanding other’s positions, causes misunderstandings that may develop into an argument.  I cannot forget the time in which a friend of mine and I got into a particularly fierce disagreement and after one of his remarks I looked at him and said, "That is exactly what I have been trying to tell you."  What we had not realized before beginning wrapped up into the argument was exactly what the other was trying to prove.  An easily fixable situation is neglected simply because people fail to take the time to understand one another, therefore causing a pointless argument that will always end in frustration.   The most viable reason for an argument would be conflict of interest, in which, because of differing personal beliefs, parties have different solutions to different problems.  Conflict of interest is the most understandable reason to argue, but may still be avoided if a calm discussion is enacted and a compromise is reached.  However, if parties refuse to settle the dispute in a tranquil manner, it will ultimately lead to a battle of some sort, whether in the media, with friends, or in extreme situations, war.    Consequently, most arguments are preventable by simply evaluating the causing factors.  Whether it is because of pride, bad communication or conflicts of interest, most are capable of being averted.  In addition, if we took more time as humans to understand what is the causing of arguments, and then prevented them, harmony as a species would be greatly closer than ever before in the past centuries.

      Am I at the point of no improvement? What of the death I still dwell in? I try to excel, but I feel no movement. Can I be free of this unreleasable sin?  Chorus: Never underestimate my Jesus. You're telling me that there's no hope. I'm telling you your wrong.  Never underestimate my Jesus When the world around you crumbles He will be strong, He will be strong  I throw up my hands "Oh, the impossibilities" Frustrated and tired Where do I go from here? Now I'm searching for the confidence I've lost so willingly Overcoming these obstacles is overcoming my fear  (Chorus)  I think I can't, I think I can't But I think You can, I think You can I think I can't, I think I can't But I think You can, I think You can Gather my insufficiencies and place them in Your hands, place them in Your hands, place them in Your hands.  (I don't know why I am posting lyrics because you can't actually hear the song, so I find it very pointless. okay, out of my system.)

      Well. I thought I would kind of do a big generic email/blog thing to let everyone know how Costa Rica is. Since, after all, you don't all reply to emails (coughaustincough) and I forgot some email addresses (coughconnorcough) I thought this could be the best way to keep in touch right now, since this time tomorrow I may not have internet connection at Ernesto y Adri's.  Costa Rica has got to be one of the most beautiful places in the world. Okay, now that we have the setting down. lol anyway, right now I'm staying with Suzie and Michele. They have got to be some of the biggest sweethearts God ever made. Honestly. Anyway, I think the 2 biggest things that have happened so far are these.  On Wednesday (I think) I gave my testimony to an evangelism group from the youth group that Michele is working with. See, Natalie and I had to sit in on the meeting (I understood like half of what was going on). And they were learning how to write testimonies and give them. So Michele had already helped me write mine out and asked me to give it. So I did. It was really cool except I was sooo nervous that I couldn't get the word mia out. First it came out mio and then miaeee and then they all laughed when I finally got it to mia. lol and then later I couldn't say involucrada, becuase that word and I just have issues. So this one guy who said nothing the rest of the night, I was like 'involcr... no involucrud' and he goes 'involucrada' and i was like 'si!' and then kept going. lol it was funny. And then they all clapped and cheered afterwards. I'm still working on whether they were happy for me (cause they said 'amen' when I said I want to be 'una misionera por que yo quiero compartir el amor de Jesucristo con otras personas) or if they cheered cause they were happy I was done. lol  Then I was talking with Suzie about the 'illegals' which are Nicaraguans. I never knew that Nicaragua was having such a  hard time, but apparently they are. So I asked if there was an I-Team down there, and Suzie said no. But this other girl Maribela wants to go down there and start one but she needs someone to go with her, you know? And I was thinking about it a lot lately (which means in the past 3 days) that maybe this is what I want to do. THey don't need me here, they're already well established. But they need people for Nicaragua. And even though I couldn't go for another six years cause of school, I could spend summers helping Maribela prepare to go down there. I could come to Costa Rica for a year of school and work with her to plan it. You know? But then, I'm not sure if this is just me thinking of all of this, or if it's God showing me what His will is for my future. So I've been praying about it. I almost want to do the whole Gideon and sheepskin thing, but I don't want to be like testing God, I just want to know for sure so I don't screw up some vast eternal plan.  Anyway, those are the big things that have happened. Email me. You all have the address.  Working on my spanish, sara  ps, bring something for the rain.

      (For those of you who didn't know, I wrote an article against gay marriage and homosexuality in general for my school's newspaper. It was published in April, obviously during the school year. I am no longer on the newspaper staff, thank God. I'm just glad that I got the article out there for people to read and think about. A lot of the stuff under this is stuff I wanted to write in that article but knew the editor would never let it be published.)  I have been thinking about this for a while now, and it is time for me to go off. I have a friend (and yes, for future reference, we are actually very good friends, although it is beyond me how that came about because we are so different in what we believe) who is "homosexual." We argue about this issue frequently. He sometimes says that "God is an invention of people in power to keep the people they wanted to control in check." He tells me this almost as often as he tells me that the only reason I think "homosexuality" is wrong is because I have been told that by my parents who were told that by their parents who were told that by  their  parents, and so on and so forth until you get to some silly, old-fashioned, close-minded priest* somewhere who had somehow gotten the idea in his head that oh my goodness, "HOMOSEXUALITY" IS A SIN. Well, it is, if you take the Bible at face value, which you should. (Read Genesis 2:24 to see what God says a family should consist of and Romans 1:26-27 to see where God says that "homosexuality" is not natural.) But my friend doesn't like hearing that someone out there isn't afraid to disagree with him.   The reason I put the word "homosexual" in quotes is because personally, I don't believe there is such a thing as "homosexuality." There are no "homosexuals." This is because "homosexuality" is NOT something you are "born with" and it's not something you can't change. Sexual orientation isn't determined by your genes or an unbalance of chemicals or   The whole idea of more than one sexual orientation in the first place is something that was created by man to justify their actions. Different people have different stumbling blocks - some lie to get out of whatever trouble they've gotten into, some are kleptomaniacs, some succumb to the temptation to look at or watch pornography, and some gravitate towards members of their own gender on a romantic level and say "it's natural."  A "homosexual" is (and this will sound harsh) just another word for someone who is living completely in sin... much like a drug addict or even a murderer. Now don't get me wrong, I am in NO WAY calling people living "homosexual" lifestyles druggies or murderers. There are definitely some relatively "good" people who call themselves "homosexuals", I can attest to that. As many times as my friend who is "homosexual" threatens to run me or other people who occasionally irritate him over in the parking lot with his car, I know he won't. But murderers and druggies can change the way they are living their lives in the same way that anyone else can stop giving into the sinful nature of their humanity. I'm no better than anyone who says they are "homosexual". The only difference is that I have given my life to Jesus Christ, and through him I am rescued from any sinful desires I may have... and believe me, just because I'm a Christian doesn't mean it's any easier to resist them. But at least I can know for sure that God will provide a way to escape the temptations so that I can stand up under them. (1 Cor. 10:13) People who don't have that relationship don't have the ability to stop living in sin and are going to try their very best to convince everyone that their favorite kind of sin is a perfectly normal thing.   "Homosexual" activists constantly argue that "if God says we should love one another, then why don't you? God loves me the way I am, he made me this way!" First of all, yes. God loves you. God loves you so much that he gave his only Son to die for you. Don't ask me why, we're really special to him for some reason that I will never fully understand. But think of it this way. Your parents love you, right? But if they find out you're shooting heroin in your closet, they aren't going to be too happy. If they're good parents, they're going to try and get you into rehab and to get you to kick the habit. It's sort of like that with God. He loves you more than anything, and yeah, he will take you as you are if you're willing to come to him and worship him, but he doesn't want you to keep living in sin. Jesus didn't die on the cross so you can say "wheeee, God loves me, now I'm going to do whatever I want because it's the way I am." Yeah, it's the way you are, but you DON'T HAVE TO STAY THAT WAY, and if you don't want to change then you haven't really understood what it means to be a Christian. Jesus died on the cross so that you can have a way to escape your sin nature. He doesn't WANT you to keep living in sin. And he clearly defines what sin is in the Bible, so you can't get away with anything. He's going to forgive you if you ask him to, but if you just go and do whatever you want because you know you'll be forgiven, you are abusing his amazing grace. If you truly and honestly love the Lord, you will strive to obey him and please him. People who are not truly walking with the Lord should not be able to get away with saying "God loves me the way I am." God loves you the way he created you, and he created you to worship and love him. If you're not doing that, you are instead dishonoring God's intentions for your body. What "homosexuals" do is not what God intended for them, therefore the argument that "God loves them the way they are" does not apply.   Because some "homosexuals" are Christians who have fallen for the worldly lie that says they are "born that way," the rest of the "homosexual" community believes oh, well THOSE must be the real Christians, because they love us for who we are. It's time for us to stand up for ourselves. The truth is so rarely heard anymore and frankly, I'm tired of being the only one defending what the  real  real Christians believe to my "homosexual" friend. We got in an argument during my science class one day and we were practically screaming at each other by the end of it, and all the other Christians in the room that I knew were listening were just sitting idly by, watching and listening. Maybe they thought I could handle it, but still, some support would have been nice. Or maybe they were afraid he was going to cuss them out, which could very well have happened. It happened to me practically every day. The world has been trying to get Christians to shut up for forever. There is always someone out there who is going to throw everything they've got at you. Get over it. It comes with the territory (John 15:17-19). There are worse things than being ridiculed for believing in God. Like, all your friends going to hell, for example. Keep that in mind.   *I'm not Catholic, but some of my ancestors could very well have been. My dad has researched our family tree for as long as I can remember, it's sort of a hobby. We're not Mormon either and he's not looking for names to baptize into the church. I think we had some Mormon ancestors though. This has been your useless Sarah trivia of the day.

      Dramaboy57: I had planned on telling you guys tonight Dramaboy57: like right now twentyfour4skies: you're always drugged up and about to sleep... and about that, we're girls, we don't just go "oh, okay, it's fine that you're doing something instead of hanging out with us like you said you would, we'll just go do something else then" it is more like we sit around overanalyzing why you said that and it becomes "oh my gosh he hates us, he doesn't want to hang out with us and thinks we are the most retarded people in the world" twentyfour4skies: so... basically, it's just a good idea to tell us up front why you can't do something when you already said you would, or at least say you'll explain why later twentyfour4skies: instead of making up a million excuses twentyfour4skies: i'm not mad, but sara is kind of depressed since she's leaving on monday  twentyfour4skies: and wanted to hang out with the people she isn't going to see for a while. i.e., you and me and connor  Good to know that I have friends who understand me. Like Sarah. And thanks to Austin for letting me chew you out last night. I'll see you all tonight!  (Although, Connor never seems to be available...)

      "I did turn 75 today -- but remember, that's only 24 Celsius."  "It's true hard work never killed anybody, but I figure, why take the chance?"  "A friend of mine was asked to a costume ball a short time ago. He slapped some egg on his face and went as a liberal economist."  To wife Nancy after John Hinckley, Jr.'s 1981 assassination attempt: "Honey, I forgot to duck."  During a 1984 debate with Walter Mondale: "I'm not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience."  "You can tell a lot about a fellow's character by his way of eating jellybeans."  "Politics is supposed to be the second oldest profession. I have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first."

The bombing begins in five minutes.''  "Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall."  "Mr. President," TV reporter Sam Donaldson yelled out at Reagan after a 1982 press conference, "In talking about the continuing recession tonight, you have blamed the mistakes of the past and you've blamed Congress. Does any of the blame belong to you?" Reagan responded, "Yes, because for many years I was a Democrat."  "Now, so there will be no misunderstanding, it's not my intention to do away with government. It is rather to make it work -- work with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back. Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it."  "Well, this administration's objective will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy that provides equal opportunity for all Americans, with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination."  "Above all we must realize that no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women."  "I hope you're all Republicans," he told doctors who were about to operate on his bullet wounds.  "Did we forget that government is the people's business, and every man, woman and child becomes a shareholder with the first penny of taxes paid?"  "We do not have a trillion dollar debt because we haven't taxed enough. We have a trillion dollar debt because we spend too much."  "Abortion is advocated only by persons who themselves have been born."  "America is too great for small dreams."  "We will always remember. We will always be proud. We will always be prepared, so we can always be free."  -  Ronald Reagan    urlLink http://connorwalsh.blogspot.com/2004/06/in-memory-of-ronald-regan-1911-2004.html   urlLink http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,63813,00.html

      "If you hadn't been screwing around, it wouldn't have gotten stuck."  Now what is the person really talking about, guess.  C-dub and I (the doctor) went bowling and i tried to be cool and do the ally cat strike thing where the girl spins the ball, but it fails and goes really slowly down the gutterlane.  Well before it gets there I roll another ball and the first one stops because it is going so slow, then this really old guys comes out and he is really angry and says "If you hadn't been screwing around, it wouldn't have gotten stuck."  so that is that story.

      it doesn't take much for my heart to break and you have done it for what seems the millionth time  whenever I hear of your saving grace and how you gave your life in exchange for mine  sometimes I wonder why you even love me and why you ever chose to call me child then I remember it's by your sacrifice I can say that  I am yous and you are mine  It doesn't take much  for me to shed a tear and you have done so many things to make me cry whenever I think of all that I've done wrong and everything that you have done to make it right  it doesn't take much for my heart to break and you have done it for what seems the millionth time ~Third Day  that song has helped me a lot this week.

      I got up this morning all ready for a stressful day, because it will be. I jumped out of bed, pulled on some of Josh's old gym shorts and ran across the street to water the neighbor's flowers and feed the cats. It was like 9:45. Then I came home, had coconut cream pie for breakfast and watched Saved By the Bell reruns. After that I took my shower, and then ten minutes later I was ready for whatever may come today. Yet, for some reason, I wasn't as frustrated as I was last night. And good ol' unorganized me sat down to make a list of my things to do today:  lay out clothes for packing hair cut ortho appt. discipleship with Daniella clean room clean bathroom meet for dance team (early with derek) FIND COSTUME FOR DANCE TEAM  The last one has been a major problem and issue of stress since about 7:30 last night. Ashley was supposed to find us costumes, I mean, honestly, I trusted her with my waist size... and then yesterday she told me that I was going to have to figure my costume out on my own. I wanted to lean over the bus seat and be like "oh, and when exactly do you expect me to do that eh? Saturday I have to pack, and I'm busy from 2-10 and Friday I'm spending with my family and Sunday I have to spend with God so I don't freak out in Costa Rica (since, if you don't recall, I will be down there for a MONTH!) and tomorrow I have cleaning to do! would have been nice if you could have given me some more notice." But you know me, I didn't say anything.   And I got up this morning expecting to run around like a little chic with her head cut off. But God was just like "hey, this is my thing ok? you let me handle it all."   Whew. Good to know someone up there has things under control. Cause I sure don't.

      The four of us (Austin, Connor, Sara without an H and me, Sarah) organized this mostly because we were bored, but because we (Sara and I, since we got this whole thing rolling) also wanted to start kind of an opinionated blog, where we could post what we think mainly about things going on in the world and in the church, but occasionally other various topics may arise (like Austin's brother's "job").  At any rate, our little motto is, appropriately, "all for One and One for all." This is not only a statement meant to unite us in our friendship, like it is in the story of The Three (or Four) Musketeers. It means more than that to us - all for One, as in Jesus Christ, the one we live for, and One for all, because Jesus is the savior of ALL mankind, and he is the ONLY way to get to heaven. That is what we believe - we're on this road together, and we're not afraid to stand up for Him.

      I have promoted myself to editor of this blog, seeing as how NO ONE BUT ME reads over their posts for mistakes, and in case you hadn't noticed I like it when words are spelled right and sentences are formed correctly.  Something else really cool that happened to me today, besides my promotion, was that I got an Inspector Gadget ringtone.

      So I dropped my brother off at I think 8 or 9 this morning. He goes and hangs out with 2 of these boys in middle school. I came back and my brother is $60 richer. He gets paid to hang out and go to the pool and launch water ballons at people everyday.

      Age is a measure of time, God is outside of time, so logically if we even want to consider age, we must consider it as a measure of maturity. Unless in cases of the law: such as driving age, drinking age, and smoking age, where breaking the law is disobedience to God, your age is defined by your maturity.

      I was talking to my friend Becca online today. We had this really interesting conversation about friends and the friends we've lost recently. She was telling me about this mutual friend that she had a lot of problems with Freshmen and Sophomore year. Then recently, this friend came back and practically begged for Becca to take her back.   Becca said no. This girl had put her through too much and she was tired of being let down. I didn't know what to say. I just thought about how we used to be this great group of friends. Then freshmen year, everything went wrong. People went to drugs and alcohol. We kinda turned our backs on each other, and now there's barely even three of us left that are still trying to hang on to what was there before.  Then I was talking to my friend Matt. It was his birthday on Tuesday and he was making fun of me cause I forked the wrong house.&nbsp; But he still got the card cause he knew the people we did it to, and he thought it was great. And then he all of a sudden said he had to go. This girl, Gracie had called and they were all going to see a movie.   They being the people at my old youthgroup. I didn't really like my old youthgroup but I wanted to curl up and cry. My friends at school are all divided. My friends from the old church never talk to me anymore. And it kinda hurt.  Because I just realized. That I can't go back. I can't be the person I was and be the person I am today. It doesn't work. It won't ever be the same again. It might be better. But it won't be the same.&nbsp; And I can't go back.

      I found a blog somewhere that mentioned this article. The New York Times ran it. The headline was "Lives; When One Is Enough." Now, let's think about that. What could that possibly allude to? What's the first thing that came into YOUR head when you read it?   I'm guessing that probably what you thought was a little different than what it actually is about. I don't subscribe to the Times (and frankly I'm not planning on it) so when I went to the website I didn't have access to the article. But there was a summary of it that was just as appalling as the story itself:  "The Lives column in The Times Magazine on July 18 gave a first-person account of the experience of Amy Richards, who had been pregnant with triplets and decided to abort two of the fetuses. Ms. Richards, who told her story to a freelance Times Magazine contributor, Amy Barrett, discussed her anxiety about having triplets, the procedure to terminate two of the pregnancies and the healthy baby she eventually delivered; she expressed no regret about her decision."  How would you like to be that kid? Think&nbsp;about it.&nbsp;I don't know what would be worse - growing up knowing your siblings were murdered in your mother's womb right next to you or growing up NOT knowing and then finding out that your mother is the kind of person who would do that to some of her children and not all of them. Either way I would be devastated.  Just a thought...

      I talked  to Minor on MSN last night! It was so great! I haven't had any contact from anyone in Costa Rica since we left. I was actually feeling kinda depressed, just wishing that they could get to an internet cafe or Andrea and Arnulfo's and write me. Especially since I've emailed like three or four of them. It was a total God thing. Exactly what I needed to cheer me up! Yaaaaay! (and of course, he somehow managed to ask if I like Jose... lol.) So he's supposed to say hi to everyone out there for me.     I'm just so excited that I got to talk to him! yaaaaaaaaaay!

      I was reading a Dave Barry column on the Miami Herald website&nbsp;and I noticed in the sidebar that there was a link called "Gay South Florida." I clicked on it out of curiousity, and&nbsp;on the page that loaded,&nbsp;I found a Gay Q&A with a guy named Steve, who is a homosexual. It broke my heart when I read this one:   Q. Steve, what can we do to get these bible abusers to get real and acknoledge that they are trying to steal civil rights from a minority, as the Nazi's did repeatedly in the early 30's ? They refuse to see their own bigotry, THEY make blind assumptions and present them as FACTS. I never asked to be gay. I tried to be "normal" for these people, it caused YET another failed marriage in America, and MORE children raised in a "broken home" when I could no longer live a lie !  -Dolphins fan 4 life, Memphis, TN&nbsp;  A. Dolphins fan, the best thing people can do is to tell their own stories, just as you've done. I'm sure other gay people will relate and nongay people will have something to think about. Thanks.    Christians  are the ones making blind assumptions? Well who is calling who a Nazi, here?   Dear Dolphins fan 4 life,  Okay, first of all: I'm sorry that the experiences you have had&nbsp;with Christians were so awful that you now&nbsp;associate&nbsp;all of us&nbsp;with Nazis and call us "bible abusers." But, well, we're not like Nazis, really.&nbsp;It hurts that you're making such a blind assumption of us,&nbsp;Dolphins fan.&nbsp;If we were like Nazis... well, things would be a lot worse for you, is all I can say. In case you didn't know, Hitler killed Christians. He wanted to create a new world religion and replace Jesus Christ as the central figure of worship with himself. He is not our best friend. So if you don't mind, don't call us Nazis.   Second of all, I would just like you to know that the Christian "agenda" is not to "steal civil rights from a minority." That's blind assumption number two for&nbsp;ya, buddy. What would be the point in stealing civil rights from&nbsp;someone?&nbsp;It's not like they're something we can hoard all to ourselves, or&nbsp;anything. "Ahaha, these are MY civil rights! Precioussss!" No. That is not&nbsp;what Christians want. At least, that isn't what REAL Christians&nbsp;want. Sometimes, as&nbsp;Christians, we&nbsp;can come off a little strong with our fire and brimstone talk, but&nbsp;ultimately... well,&nbsp;real&nbsp;Christians want to spread the truth of God's&nbsp;Word to the world. We're not supposed to point fingers and&nbsp;act like we're better than everyone else, because we're not. But, well, like it or not, God's Word says that homosexuality is a SIN. Yes, that's right. SIN.&nbsp;It's a hard word to hear, I know.&nbsp;But guess what, EVERYBODY DOES IT! MYSELF INCLUDED!&nbsp;SIN IS A HARD THING TO DEAL WITH!&nbsp;The ONLY difference between us&nbsp;is that I recognize my need for a Savior. I know I sin. I know I can't do anything worth doing&nbsp;apart from Christ. And I know and believe&nbsp;that Jesus&nbsp;is the only way for me to escape the consequences of sin.  (Collective gasp) WHAT? There are CONSEQUENCES for SIN? But... I thought I could just do whatever the heck I wanted and get away with it! Isn't that what America is all about?  IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE, BUT IT SURE IS LOOKING THAT WAY LATELY.   But you know what the absolute greatest part is? Yeah, there are consequences for sinning. To put it bluntly, people who sin go to hell. Which means that all of us are condemned to hell. (Oh yes! I  went  there! Final destination for sinners = HELL!) But you don't have to go to hell.  What? But you just said...  Yeah. Remember Jesus? You know, the guy who came to Earth roughly&nbsp;2000 years ago...? Well, he did this thing for us. He died. On the cross. He was crucified, which is actually a pretty painful way to die. I don't know for sure, but I would&nbsp;even venture that it is probably THE most painful way to die. But see, he didn't die because he did something wrong. In fact, he never did ANYTHING wrong in his entire life. He never sinned, not once. Which is pretty amazing, if you think about it. The reason he was able to not sin his entire life was because he was actually God in the flesh, which is even more incredible. God!&nbsp; Walking around! &nbsp;On   Earth!  &nbsp;TALKING to people!&nbsp;Come on, doesn't that mean something to you? It sure means something to me. You know why? Because he came to Earth to die for ME. He did it because he for some insane reason LOVES me and wants me to be with him in heaven for eternity. So when he rose again three days after he was put into the grave, he had conquered death and from then on, all you had to do was believe in him as your Savior and follow him. That's it. Believing in Jesus = salvation from sin and its consequences.&nbsp;It's REALLY not that&nbsp;hard to understand.   Dolphins fan, in fear of sounding incredibly hateful, let me just say this. Gays and lesbians should NOT be whining about being persecuted. You're getting an amazing amount of press because of all your&nbsp;various antics, and all the blame for your supposed "unhappiness" is landing on us Christians. After all, we're the ones upholding the founding fathers' Constitution. We're the ones who want to keep America's last bit of purity before we lose it completely. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not bitter about the whole persecution thing. It's promised in the Bible that because the world hated Jesus, they will hate his followers. So really, I don't care if you do it. But because this is America, and we have freedom of speech and religion, I'm able to defend what I believe, which is what I'm doing.   I'm a Christian. Am I afraid of change, like everyone always accuses us of being? YES! I an desperately afraid that this nation is going to forget their Creator. I'm so scared that America is going to be a highway for others in the world to be led astray, and I'm scared that even more people are going to end up separated from God for eternity. It is MIND BOGGLING that SO many people actually believe the lie that they were "born that way." Satan is having his way with this country. Homosexuality isn't the only thing that's wrong with us.&nbsp;There&nbsp;is a plethora of other things that should worry any thinking person.&nbsp;Why wouldn't I be afraid? But thankfully, he who is in me is greater than he who is in the world. And he's our only prayer right now. He's always been our only prayer, and personally, I wouldn't have it any other way.  Sincerely, Sarah  Dear Steve,  Thank you for posting that comment. It did give me something to think about.  Love, Sarah

       I just found this really interesting website (all thanks to Sarah,&nbsp;I might add). The guy on there calls himself Jesus. I could totally understand that if he was latin or something, but I'm thinking he's not. Although, I could be wrong...&nbsp;but for my sake I'm going to assume he was being a moron who thought he was funny.   I clicked on his website after looking through people who have the same interests as me on their profiles. I thought it looked interesting because he had both Christianity and Atheism listed as interests side by side. Oh it was interesting all right. I just want to clarify a few things that he said about Christianity. I just want to point out what was right and what was wrong, in case any of you ever see it, you'll know.   And he isn't a Christian, so I think I'm a bit more of an expert on our beliefs. But hey, you don't have to believe me. It's your brain. It's your own screwed up twisted and brainwashed mind,&nbsp;don't let me tell you what to think.   He said that Christians believe homosexuality is wrong. Welcome to biggest problem in America 101. It is. For a Christian to walk around saying that being gay is okay, and then claim to know God's laws and commands is impossible. That person is a liar. Mentira. They obvoiusly have not read Leviticus. If you are a Christian, I'm talking to you.&nbsp; Being gay is a sin. I don't think of it any differently than lying, because in God's eyes, sin is sin, there's no difference between lying and murdering. It's a hard concept to grasp, but it's the truth. So I don't freak out about homosexuals. I think it's kinda gross, just because I could never look at a girl that way, but I'm not going to walk around my school and tell people to turn for homosexuality or burn in hell. If that was the case, I would be burning in hell for all the times I'm disrespectful. Thankfully I've got Jesus to pull me out of that.   If you don't believe me that being gay is a sin according to God, well I'm not the one who came up with it.&nbsp; "Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable" (Leviticus 18:22) If you don't take the Bible seriously, and you don't believe that what it says is word for word the absolute truth, well honey you need to get a life. Estupido nika. (AY! lo siento) So it says right there that it's a sin, just like lying or cheating, although the consequences are greater.   Then this 'jesus' guy said that Jesus (as in Jesucristo) can save you from homosexuality. Well yea, that's true. Because Jesus saves us from our sin. He saves me from my lying, my cheating, my disrespectful attitude, my cussing, bla bla bla. So since homosexuality is just another sin, he saves you from that, and helps you to turn to God and the right way. In this case, heterosexuality would be the right way; God's way. In my case, using my mouth to be nice and encouraging rather than making fun of people would be God's way.   It's just sin guys. It's a little more visible, that's why some people are so bothered by it. But it's just sin. Hate the sin, love the sinner. Becuase if you don't love the sinner, how will he see Jesus in you? If a man says he loves God and yet hates his brother, he's a liar! God is love, we should be, too.   That's it in a nutshell. That was the one that really bothered me. I just wanted to set the record straight with everything that's going on in the country. How could I let someone tell the world what I&nbsp; believe, and yet be totally wrong about all of it? I had to tell you myself. I just wanted you to know. Becuase this guy 'jesus' doesn't know what he's talking about. But my Jesus does. My Jesus always knows what he's talking about. Because my Jesus is the truth.&nbsp;    (Almost forgot, I'm really sorry if I keep saying stuff in Spanish. I even did it at Master Drive today. I don't know what's wrong with me.)

      Well, that was the best title I could think of for this post. Because there really isn't anything that can be said to announce what I want to share. Partially, because I have no idea what I am going to share with y'all today. Okay, that's not true. I know what I'm goind to say, I just don't know how. I guess...   I have a friend, who for the sake of privacy, I am going to call her Annie. Annie's a sweet girl just a little lost and craving love and attention. I know, newsflash, isn't the entire world. But Annie has had a particularly bad time with things. She has a good home and a great family who loves her, but she's incredibly unhappy, or at least she was when she started drugs. She's doing better now, and she only cuts on the rare occasion. (yay)   But as a Christian, I recognize that as not being enough, especially since the only one who is keeping her from drugs and cutting is her boyfriend. We all know how stupid and unpredictable boys are. So I just told her one night online (at close to 12 mind you) that I wish she had something a little more constant. Of course the question came, what could be more constant. And of course, my answer was Jesus.   Oh great, now there's a can of worms that I just opened. But she actually didn't flip out on me like I expected. On the contrary, she just said thanks, she knows I want her to have 'good things' but she's okay right now. So then I said something along the lines of 'I don't know about good things, I just don't really want you to go to Hell.' and then she asked why that would happen, because she's a pretty good person; sure she hurts herself, but she doesn't hurt others a whole lot. At least, she tries not to.   But it was so insane. I mean, I got to totally share Christ with her. I gave her the '4-1-1' on Christianity, salvation, Jesus, God, sin. You know? And hello?! It was all over IM.  IM!!  Who honestly shares Christ over the internet at midnight?! It was almost 1 when I finished and stold her I was going to bed.   It was just so amazing because the week before Derek and Kari talked about being Jesus here, and not just on mission trips. They said that we need to bring the mission field back to our school and share Christ with everyone. And it's hard, they know. I mean, they're only seniors. But I just kinda scoffed when Kari said something about, not waiting for the opportunity but creating it. I figure, God creates the opportunity, not me, I'll just take it and run with it when He gives me something.   Oh, He gave it to me alright. I never thought I would share Christ with Annie. I always thought she would tell me no, she didn't want to hear it. And then I told her how much Jesus loves her just 2 nights ago. I may have made that comment about having Jesus as a constant in life, but even that wasn't me. That was God. I got offline and just couldn't stop thinking about it. I've seen God work in crazy ways before, but never like this.   The whole thing was God. I could do nothing to start something like that, I could do nothing to open up Annie's heart and make her willing to listen. That was God. My words were God. I saved the conversation and reread it yesterday. Holy Cow*, I could never say those kind of things on my own, not unless I planned them ahead of time!   So I guess all I have to say is, yea Annie may not have become a Christian. But for some reason, God used me ( me of all people) to show Him to her with some text in a little window on Monday morning. I think it's really cool when you can see God work like that. It's not very often, but it happens once in a while. So guys? just keep trying. Because you don't have to do anything, God will give you the time and the words to say. He did for me. And trust me, it will come up in places you never thought possible. Like IM at midnight.   luv y'all bunches and bunches! Dios le bendiga.   &nbsp;  *sarah, yes it is a special Cow.

      "O My beloved, abide under the shelter of the lattice for I have betrothed you to Myself, and though you are sometimes indifferent toward Me, My love for you is at all times as a flame of fire."  &nbsp;  This is the first sentence of the book  Come Away My Beloved  by Frances J. Roberts. When I read it, I almost started crying. Everyone's always told me that God knows exactly what I'm going through in every situation because he lived on the Earth and&nbsp;went through the whole&nbsp;human experience&nbsp;firsthand. But in my ignorance, I always sort of doubted somewhere in my mind that he knew what it was like to feel unrequited love, to know what it's like to be rejected by the object of your affection for whatever reason. Looking at it now it seems so  stupid.  Of  course  he knows what that's like. I do it to him  all the time.  We  all  do. He loves every single one of us so intimately and so dearly, but half the time we're off doing our own thing in our own little world. He loved us so much that he  died  for us, and any pain I ever went through because of a guy not liking me back is absolutely insignificant compared to the pain that Jesus goes through every single time&nbsp;we turn away from him, indifferent.  &nbsp;  He  knows.

      "The nature of Christ's salvation is woefully misrepresented by the present-day evangelist. He announces a Savior from Hell rather than a Savior from sin. And that is why so many are fatally deceived, for there are multitudes who wish to escape the Lake of fire who have no desire to be delivered from their carnality and worldliness." -Arthur W. Pink

      I have a really good friend; I think I mentioned him yesterday when i said I was a moron? Yea, that one. Well he apparently is okay with me and my stupidity. He came over this morning and gave me these two cards he'd picked up at walgreens. My brother thought he was a salesman and wasn't going to answer the door. And I was still in my pajamas, so I had to pull on a huge thick freaking hot hoodie to go upstairs and peek out the window, because I thought that myabe by some weird coincedence it would be him, after what I'd just read two seconds ago on the blog.  And it was him. Stupid brothers. So he gave me the cards and I let him in and we talked for a few minutes and then he had to leave. And then my brother made some stupid comment (after he was gone) like, "he knows he has to come through me first, and dad. wow, that's like double! 'hey, you're in!'" Which was totally lame because it's not like he likes me or something. But my brother is kind of a moron like that early in the morning...  But it was hilarious, because I was reading what he wrote in one of them and it was something about puting up with his shananingans. See, I wrote him this long apology last night (actually this morning at like 1:00 am) and I said almost the exact same thing. So, it was funny to me.  I'm just glad to know that I have such good friends who are willing to deal with my ups and downs and my conspiracy theorist.  And most of all, I'm glad I have Sarah and her 'couples therapy.' Even though, we aren't a couple, it was good to work stuff out with Austin. Because without her, I wouldn't be talking to him currently. Which would be really stupid because he's leaving tomorrow for some boy scouts thing. (speaking of which, why is he still in boy scouts? he's 16 for crying out loud!)  And it's been really confusing after getting back from Costa Rica. I've lost a lot of things and I've found a whole lot more. But I don't know what to do with any of it. It's good to know that I have friends that are going to sit next to me on the roller coaster and hold my hand when it gets really bad. Because it will eventually. Costa Rica changed a lot, and as much as I wish, it's not going to go back to the way it was. But I think that's okay. Because, as always, God has it under control. We're just here to ride along and make the occasional choice about which ride we're going to next.

      Why I am posting this, I could not tell you, but the computer doesn't seem sufficent enough.  I don't know why you would want to read this unless you were terribly horribly bored beyond any reason.  I am not venting because I am angry, I just want someone to hear.   Sometime this week I was driving home from seeing Anchorman with people in my car, which was okay with my parents.  Turning on a Venneford, a residential street from highlands ranch park way. I slowed down to turn left and so that my friends could wave by  (bad decision I know) well my friend who is at least 10 seconds behind doesn’t notice that I have slowed down and runs taps the back of my car.  I pull off left and she right and I could go into a huge description of what happen from then but we will just say that that she hit me and I was not happy but told my parents and got yelled and her parents agreed to pay she even said that it was all her fault.  I talked with my parents and we yelled and then got sad and we cried and everything was better. Saturday I think I went to Red Robin and that was fun but nothing too exciting unfortunately since Jessica had left.  While leaving the parking lot my friend got really sick and threw up in the grass.  Kate from RI had to drive Jessamyn’s car home (Kate only has a permit) I had to lead her home the safe way and she was going about 35 which is smart but took a while.  I don’t remember the rest of Saturday. What has happened, going from Sunday, I set my alarm for church but being the smart person that I am, I hit the off button, well I finally woke up about 9:10 or so, which for those of you who don’t go to my church, it started at 9.  I run around a drive over and arrive maybe about 9:35 or so, (half way through the service) right when worship was ending.  I the next part was listening to a sermon by the seniors, which I applaud, but (and no offense) is not as good as an intern or pastor, and are not expected to be that good.  I continued by going to the mall and walking around for a while.  My feet began to hurt and since it was around 1:45 or so I wanted to go home because I was bored and was not doing anything productive (no offense to anyone at the mall I was very tired).  I continued to go home and ask my parents if I could not go on the canoeing trip and got talked into it.  Monday woke up and started off okay, was planning on running but that didn’t happen, got called by Kate, my friend from Rhode Island.  Went over to the park about 1 or 2 or so and I stayed there for a while before I decided that I just needed to go somewhere else.  So I rode my bike (my brother had taken the car) over to Phil Fisher’s house because I knew him and Kevin Berry were over there playing video games. Well they were down in the basement so I went over to the Lauren Pagnard’s house (2 houses down) to ask if I could borrow the phone and call Phil and make sure that Lauren knew that she was invited to the park with Kate.  (Note: this is the girl who the previous week hit the back bumper of my car.)  I came in and it was her mother she laughed and joked and I borrowed the phone and told Phil to open the door. So he comes up and opens the door and I play counterstrike with them for a while. I go home and get ready for Scouts that night, I have a meeting with the Canoe trip people and that goes well except I had a huge headache and I really didn’t want to be there. Turns out at scouts the leadership was gone so it was free night, naturally I left and went over to Walgreens because Monday nights Kate Meek from church works there so I buy cards for friends, 1 for a sick friend, Jessamyn and 2 for another friend Sara.  I stood there for a while and wrote encouraging notes. Got home, and did nothing productive.  Tuesday I wake up and want to go running again but I have to make sure Shane wakes up for work so I play video games all morning then my dad says write your mission letter so I don’t because I smart like that.  Later I want to go hang out with Kate and my dad gets angry (note* my dad gets angry very quickly)(note*my peeve is when people get angry very quickly) he had the right to say no but he didn’t, thank you.  I went over to the park and hung out with Kate and friends then we went down to Teresa’s house and I watched the first 15 minutes of School Of Rock but I went home at 9 because my dad had called and said that there was an emergency.  Naturally I was concerned so I came home promptly at 9 thinking it was my grandpa or something.  Well my dad was on the phone and so was my mom and they didn’t seemed to worried, then 15 minutes later they sat me down and asked everything that had happened during the accident (going back to the beginning) I was confused as to why they were asking again.  They had told me that an anonymous letter had come in the mail about the accident.  I told them the story about how I had switched in to the left lane on Broadway in front of her and slowed quickly to turn on to highlands ranch parkway and how I had sped up to 55 at the max just because were teenagers (stupid decision and I am never speeding or racing ever again) and then told them that I slowed back down and stopped at the left turn off of highlands ranch onto venneford and waited for a car so that I could go and she would have to wait that way we would not egg each other on and she would not follow to closely, I continued to slow down was I had turned and she didn’t notice and tapped the back of my car, causing some damage which she said was her fault and she was soooo sorry. Well back to my parents and the letter, the letter had come and said (from the point of view of a student in the car) it was all my fault and Kate’s fault for wanting to slow down and I should be ashamed and was a horrible friend and Christian for not taking the blame and making Lauren (the other driver) pay. (Note: my mom has a degree in psychology and is extremely good with people and understanding them, I take after my mother in this and we are extremely good and discerning, in fact I think it is one of my mom’s spiritual gifts, it is impossible to lie to her.  My family is one of psychologists and you don’t try to deceive us, especially not my mother.)  My parents and I had a very long discussion and I got more lecturing, we then wondered who might have sent the letter and I deemed that most people in the cars would be too shy or to lazy to send a letter and only certain people knew the info in the letter.  I had narrowed it down to Jessamyn, but my mom being the genius that she is knew Lauren very well, and Ms. Pagnard (her mother) and wondered whether it was Ms. Pagnard who had sent it in order that she would only have to pay half the cost.  I thought it back and forth (and you should see me and my mom do this, it is really quite amazing how we only using psychology to do this and my dad sits in the middle dumbfounded while we are like detectives.  We narrowed it down to Jessamyn, Ms. Pagnard, or Lauren telling Teresa and Teresa writing a note (which I don’t think was very plausible so I didn’t consider it).  I was extremely hurt if it was Jessamyn because I did not want her to think those things about me since we have been friends for 12 years almost and I value that friendship a lot.  Wednesday I went over to her house around 9 am (she was leaving at 10 to go to Utah for Jr. Olympics for her sister) I gave her the get well card and asked her in her honest opinion if she though the accident was my fault.  I realized that night before I went to bed that it wasn’t Jessamyn because I remember her supporting me and she doesn’t write in cursive and that was how the letter was addressed.  She very strongly said no that it was all Lauren’s fault and that legal it was her fault and that I should not have to pay, I ask about the letter and she said it was horrible and that she did not write it. So if it wasn’t Jessamyn that left one other person Mrs. Pagnard.  She had written a letter saying mean things about me and saying it was my fault and acting like she was a student so that she would only have to pay half the costs.  We are pretending like the letter was never sent and continuing with them paying for the damages.  I was personally offended, well I get back and my dad flips because he wants the letters finished and so I write them and address I still need to send them.  I finished them so I went to brunch with a friend and had a talk with that person but it wasn’t a very happy one because they don’t me that life sucked and they hated living and that they were cutting themselves and that the medication to bring them out of depression wasn’t working (they goes to a shrink). I tried to encourage them and get them involved with a church or something but I am still afraid. I then came home and worked on packing for my canoe trip which I had all my stuff together but it wasn’t packed enough for my dad so he started yelling at me.  I then asked if I could go to the mall with Sara and Sarah and there was more yelling at me. So I packed and slept and then my mom got home and I was still angry with my dad so she got angry at me.  More yelling and arguing.  I then ate dinner, which went well because Brent and Shane were home.  I then got online and was talking people and I accidentally angered a friend (note: I hate IM because I am a person who deciphers most of what is being said by voice inflection and body language, it is the psychology thing I was talking about earlier.)  Connor kept on calling and I was talking to him but so much was going on I couldn’t keep track and I was trying to get over to his house but I first wanted to work out the problem with this friend.  I didn’t quite know what to say at first and I felt like a kept on rambling on.  Finally I got the impression that we were okay and I had to go (yes I did get the last few sentences but had to leave) I was already late by 30 minutes for Connor’s, but things went better because Ryan was there and I hadn’t seen either of them in a while, and we watched Bourne Identity. The only problem is that I have had a headache since about the conversation with my friend and over IM and it was only getting worse, I was afraid that I might get a migraine and have to be picked up.  I was supposed to be home by 11 and didn’t get home till 11:40 or so because the movie ran over, luckily my parents really don’t notice when I get home as long as I check in.  I came home and checked the blog and received a very touching apology, which I accept humbly.  I am now helping my brother pack for his camping trip and just told him about the accident and he just gave me another lecture.  It is now 1:36 on Thursday, I have no idea what I am suppose to do with this writing, I have just been talking to my computer for about and 1 ½ hours.  Maybe I will post it. Hey I still need to get those 2 cards from Monday to Sara before I leave. Good night.

      Today I got mad at a really close friend of mine. My brother has this theory about how a woman's brain works. There's a three ring circus with four men. There's crying man, all he does is cry and cry, there's Skitzo, and when he's up, you can never understand what she's thinking. Then there's conspiracy theorist, and no matter what you say, if he's got the mike, she's going to think you're saying she's fat or ugly. The last guy is a midget. He's in a straight jacket and he's all black and blue because the others beat up on him so much. He's logic man. The trick to understanding, and communicating with a woman, is to know who has the mike.  all of today conspiracy theorist was in control in my head. And whenever Logic man tried to take it from him, he got bashed in the head with the mike. And instead of realizing it myself, I just went all out and ate this guy alive. Poor Austin had no idea he said anything. And he even apologized a million times and I wouldn't take it. Because Logic Man wasn't in control. I finally told him I was sorry for being a freak and being immature. But he didn't respond.  Maybe, just maybe he wised up and realized that maybe I'm not worth all the trouble I give him. In some ways, I hope he did (for his sake of course). But on the other hand, I want a second chance, to not be such a moron.  All I'm trying to say, and this is mainly for the girls, guys don't process things the way we do. I know you've heard that a million times. But trust me, I just figured it out today first hand. And it's an experience you don't want to have. So just know when they're joking. And if you want them to be serious, you kinda have to tell them. And when you're talking to someone online, be careful, because with out the tone of voice and facial expressions, it is really hard to understand what someone is saying. Be careful. And give your guy friends some extra space.  and guys? do the same thing for the girls. Because sometimes we're stupid and we take things personally when we shouldn't. Just give us some time, and we'll be okay again.

         "In your lives you must think and act like Christ Jesus. Christ himself was like God in everything. But he did not think that being equal with God was something to be used for his own benefit. But he gave up his place with God and made himself nothing. He was born to be a man and became like a servant.  And when he was living as a man, he humbled himself and was fully obedient to God, even when that caused his death-death on a cross. So God raised him to the highest place. God made his name greater than every other name so that every knee will bow to the name of Jesus-everyone in heaven, on earth, and under the earth. And everyone will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and bring glory to God the Father."  Philippians 2:5-11 (NCV)

      By Dale Buss  "When I'm teaching Sunday school, I'm encouraged by what I hear from the teenagers at my evangelical Christian church in suburban Detroit. They seem to understand - and, more important, to believe - the bedrock tenets that will help them hew to orthodoxy throughout their lives and make them salt and light in the world.  But the hard numbers say otherwise. It turns out that, while they may profess the faith and indeed love Jesus, the vast majority of Christian teenagers in this country actually hold beliefs fundamentally antithetical to the creed. The forces of moral relativism and 'tolerance' have gotten to them in a big way. In fact, some leaders believe that mushy doctrine among the younger generation ranks as the No. 1 crisis facing American Christendom today.  About one-third of American teenagers claim they're 'born again' believers, according to data gathered over the past few years by Barna Research Group, the gold standard in data about the U.S. Protestant church, and 88% of teens say they are Christians. About 60% believe that 'the Bible is totally accurate in all of its teachings.' And 56% feel that their religious faith is very important in their life.  Yet, Barna says, slightly more than half of all U.S. teens also believe that Jesus committed sins while he was on Earth. About 60% agree that enough good works will earn them a place in heaven, in part reflecting a Catholic view, but also flouting Protestantism's central theme of salvation only by grace. About two-thirds say that Satan is just a symbol of evil, not really a living being. Only 6% of all teens believe that there are moral absolutes--and, most troubling to evangelical leaders, only 9% of self-described born-again teens believe that moral truth is absolute.  'When you ask even Christian kids, "How can you say A is true as well as B, which is the antithesis of A?," their typical response is, "I'm not sure how it works, but it works for me,"' says George Barna, president of the Ventura, Calif.-based research company. 'It's personal, pragmatic and fairly superficial.'  ~~~  Some commentators produce even more startling statistics on the doctrinal drift of America's youth. Ninety-one percent of born-again teenagers surveyed a few years ago proclaimed that there is no such thing as absolute truth, says the Rev. Josh McDowell, a Dallas-based evangelist and author. More alarmingly, that number had risen quickly and steadily from just 52% of committed Christian kids in 1992 who denied the existence of absolute truth. A slight majority of professing Christian kids, Mr. McDowell says, also now say that the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ never occurred. 'There's a greater disconnect now than ever in the history of the church in America between what a Christian young person says they are and what they actually believe,' says Mr. McDowell, who has ministered mainly to youth for more than 30 years. 'Christianity is based on truth; Jesus said, "I am the truth." But you have an overwhelming majority even of Christian kids saying there is no absolute truth.'  Catholics have noticed the trend as well. A few weeks ago, in fact, Pope John Paul II specifically warned several U.S. bishops about the 'soulless vision of life' that seemed to be overtaking America, urging them to 'confront directly the widespread spirit of agnosticism and relativism which has cast doubt on reason's ability to know the truth,' especially among youth.  Indeed, the consequences of this theological implosion now pervade the thoughts and actions of believing teenagers, following the moral breakdown of the broader American culture. Here's one practical example: Only 10% of Christian teens believe that music piracy is morally wrong, according to a recent Barna survey, not all that different from the 6% of their non-Christian peers who feel the same way.  Then extrapolate the situation to other possible big-picture results. Nearly 60% of evangelical Christian teenagers now say that all religious faiths teach equally valid truths, according to Mr. McDowell. It's bad enough that they seem to have been co-opted by relativism from within our culture and even from within the church and family. But it's even more disconcerting to realize that  we're relying on this generation for the future defense of Judeo-Christian civilization  against the highly motivated forces of militant Islam.  Perhaps it's counterintuitive to believe this problem is as severe as that outlined by Messrs. Barna and McDowell. After all, we're told that spirituality is de rigueur among youths these days and that Christianity is right up there. But this zeitgeist largely reflects a pseudo-faith that is fed by a steady diet of pop-culture feints, from the allegorical 'Lord of the Rings' movies to the T-shirt that recently adorned Pamela Anderson saying, 'Jesus is my homeboy.'  The kids in my Sunday School class really do understand that. It's their peers I'm worried about."  ~  Hey guys. Let's try to not give them reason to worry.

      The other day, I was thinking about how sometimes I just feel like I try to be involved in youth group for no reason. I know, I know, I haven't been back from Costa Rica even a full week yet and I already started feeling the old familiar pity party starting back up again. I felt like nobody really cared because no one bothered to call me when some people were going to go see a movie. Really childish, yes, because I do know better. It wasn't one of my better moments; I felt like convincing myself that the world DID revolve around me, I WAS the center of the universe, everyone should care about ME, cater to MY needs because I'M the only one that matters or who has feelings or wants to be taken care of. But then I realized how retarded I was being and moved on to being depressed about other things that don't deserve to be discussed on this blog.  Anyway, my point is, what really made me stop being depressed and start contributing positive vibes to society again is I remembered that it's not about ME. I'll admit that I didn't read all of The Purpose-Driven Life, but I definitely read the first sentence, and that's what it is: It's not about YOU. There's more to life than not being invited to see a movie with some people, there's more to life than not seeing your friends when you want to or missing out on something you thought you were going to get to do. Who knows what kinds of things you could end up doing instead of what you planned? God's in control of EVERY situation, and even if it pisses you off at first, the only thing for it is to make the best of what you're stuck with. God doesn't switch things around because you throw a hissy fit and whine about it for hours. He's happy to listen to you, of course, but he wants you to trust him that he knows what's best for you. And right now I'm even trying to convince myself to do this, because it's not the easiest thing. I'm still having problems figuring a few things out, and remembering how to act when certain people are around. And yeah, I'm a little upset at the way things have been going for me, and the stuff I've been putting myself through by complicating things isn't too fun either. But God is in control. He knows what's best for me, and I will love what he's decided for me.   Even so, it's hard to remember. After all, I'm only human.

      This is me venting!  Early this year I signed up a canoeing trip called Boundry Waters with Boy Scouts.  I asked the guy who led it a billion times, what are the dates, he FINALLY got me the dates and I said okay.  Then about the beginning of Summer I realized that I did not have time for this trip, so I have been calling him for hmmm may 18th or so trying to tell him "Hey, I can't go!" because the trip is about 11 days, which is fine because then someone else could just take my spot.  I left about 5 messages on his phone saying "Hey call me!"  and he ignores them and then goes on vacation for 2 weeks and finally i get a hold of him today and he tells me that there is a meeting tomorrow, oh but not only that, but he is adding an extra day so it is now 12 days and I have to miss the photo party.  I want to tell him, "well that is too bad, I can't go because I have a previous arrangement for teh night of the 16th", oh did I mention that I have only paid 100 out of 450 dollars for the trip because I couldn't get a hold of him.  I want to say "Too bad I am not paying, get someone else to go!" but my dad would be mad because then I would make the guy angry and he might be on my eagle board of review, which is unlikely but possible, nd my dad doesn't want to be rude. (which is unusual because most of the time he wouldn't care and if it was anything but scouts he probably wouldn't) so now I am stuck going on a trip that I really don't want to go on for 12 days and then I have another trip after that and I am left with 14 days of summer in which I am home. gggggggrrrrrrrr. I rarely (like maybe 4 times a year)get angry but I am right now. I am missing so much more, it is not even just the photo party, I am missing a ton of stuff even when my friend from Rhode Island is leaves, and this is the last time she will come to colorado.   I hate this trip with the firey passion of a 1,000,000,000 burning suns all exploding in one enormously cataclsymic violent hateful blast!!!!!!!!!!!!   Thank you for listening to me vent, it doesn't happen very often so thank you for enduring.

      Last night they had a comedian at church. My parents dragged me to it, but hey, the free dessert was awesome! But he said something last night about Unity in the church. I thought, finally someone who agrees with me! I've wanted a pulpit to preach from quite a few times. It's always about unity in the church.  It's so stupid to. I mean, why do I have to drive down University and see four or five churchs, and under their name is splayed "lutheran church" "Evangelical" "Methodist" I mean honestly. Doesn't it really all come down to a man dying on a cross, and coming back to life three days later to save the world? Isn't that CHRISTIANITY? So why the big hang up over denominations? "Ooo, I'm methodist, I can't talk to you southern baptist freaks." I mean seriously, who does that?  I have to admit I used to be in on it to. I kept asking my parents what I was, and I finally managed to get it out of my mom, "if you really want to label your beliefs, you're probably closest to a baptist" But that ended in like eighth grade. I mean, why should I have to label my faith? I'm already a Christian, is there more to it than that?  I know there are differences between denominations. but that shouldn't separate us. Hello? We're Christians, we are apart of one body. How can a body be separated? If my eye pops out of my head, turns around and says 'hey, I'm apart of Sara's Body, but I'm also separate from everything else here, I'm Saran but I'm an eyeish-saran' don't you think that's going to hurt me? Like me in my basic self is not good enough for my eye!  I think that's how Jesus must feel. We were all the same back in Palestine. Yea, they had issues and doctrinal questions over things like circumsision and kosher. But they didn't separate and go, 'I'm a galilean Christian, are you a Jerusaleman Christian?' The few times that they did that, and started talking about who they followed (apollo, paul) Someone turned yelled at them and they got right back into line. I think Jesus sometimes must be sitting up there looking at us fighting over stupid things that don't even matter, and I think he's saying something like *sigh* 'my children, I love them to death, but they can be so stupid! Don't they understand anything? I died for them so that they could be one with me, and one with eachother. Now they're screwing it up again over dumb things. Was my death not enough to hold them together? It's no wonder they aren't getting anything done! It's too bad they aren't like the Muslims who actually have their act together when it comes to unification. How can they expect to get anything done, if they're fighting all the time!? Hello???!!! I DIED FOR YOU! GET IT? THAT'S ALL IT TAKES. THAT'S ALL IT'S ABOUT!!! Now just try to stop fighting and see me again? Please?'  Because that's what we're doing. We're fighting over stupid things. And when we can't agree, when we can't stop fighting, how do you expect us to move and share Jesus with everyone else? It's impossible!  And there shouldn't be anything to fight about. We have to come back to the basics, because that is what got us here in the first place. We have to come back to Jesus. His death and his resurrection. Beyond that, nothing matters. Because beyond that, nothing gets you to heaven. Nothing keeps you out of hell. Nothing is worth living for. Worth dying for.  If we all believe that, why are we fighting?

      Lord, I want to be a servant of the King! And I want my life to be inspired by all You bring.  But for this I must die!  And sometimes it's hard to understand the reasons why!  Isn't there wome way I can save a piece of me?  Isn't there somehow You can take this cup from me?  Lord, I hear You whispering that this is how it has to be.  But, my God, it's awfully hard to say goodbye to me.  Hold me close as I say goodbye to me, Let my heart know that you are all I need,  I'll stay right here on my knees, Until I have the strength to say goodbye to me. 'Cause i'm tired of livin' somehwere in-between My love for you and my love for me. So take whatever's left of me I sacrifice it, Lord to Thee, Goodbye to me!  Help me cast down every idol that I've built Lord, and lay them all where Calvary's blood was spilt, There where You sacrificed Yourself for me, Now it's my turn, Lord, to die for Thee!  Hold me close as I say goodbye to me, Let my heart know that you are all I need,  I'll stay right here on my knees, Until I have the strength to say goodbye to me. 'Cause i'm tired of livin' somehwere in-between My love for you and my love for me. So take whatever's left of me I sacrifice it, Lord to Thee, Goodbye to me!

      Well. It was one month yesterday. Sitting on the plane looking out the window, it was weird. It seems like years ago that Suzie picked me up at the airport, but then, I can't believe that I am already at home and it's over.  God did a lot on that trip. I learned a lot about myself, how God works (or doesn't) and boys. Which I know is weird to learn about on a mission trip, but I really needed to.   It feels good to be home. I just can't believe it's over. I can't believe that I won't go to the church tonight and hear Kenneth say something about his nipples (how did that start again?) and the leaders won't stare at us becuse they don't know he meant dimples. It's so weird to think that I won't see Brian again, and I won't drive with that maniac for another year, and hello? I can't believe the tping with Mary Jo is over. I can't imagine not going to the church tonight, I can't imagine not seeing Connor tell Jose what he's doing wrong with the mime tonight.  I just can't believe it's over. What do I do now?

         Every Sunday I serve my time in God's army aboard a luxury aircraft carrier. We move slow and we are rarely anywhere close enough to shore to actually see any of the people we are out to liberate. We fly sorties such as Operation Short Term Missions, Operation School Curriculum, or Operation Beth Moore Conference. Most of us don't fly in these important missions, but there's nothing wrong with enjoying the prosperous life of a soldier. Our ship has plenty of activities - putting greens, a sports ministry, restaurants, and even a special 'fright house" on Halloween! We don't get a lot of visitors from the outside - but thats the benefit of being on a mega-sized luxury aircraft carrier - there's enough people around to pack it in without noticing the lack of outsiders (besides - you can't let just anybody on a luxury aircraft carrier - there's a war on!). Critics may say its more a cruise ship than a battle ship, but who said soldiers had to be uncomfortabe? Nope. We are going to win this war - and win it in style. God help the S.S. HouseChurch patroling the Chinese rivers. Perhaps we'll airlift in a care package of VeggieTales and Purpose Driven Books to help our poor brothers in the good fight. Fore!
