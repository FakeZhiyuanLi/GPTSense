      it's been a while since i wrote in my blog. Hope she still checks this out from time to time. Why does she always lift me up? She's really like my angel in disguise. She was sent down from heaven to bedazzle me and change my life. am i being exaggerated? maybe a little. but it's still all true. the way she encourages me to go on. to enlighten my mind is a way to say it. she so kind, gentle and obviously as pretty as a fairy. thank you very much. i don't know what to say. i don't even know what to do. tomorrow is CAT again. i hate it so much. the way we get pushed aaround by people that we used to know. .that is one of the things i lose interest in school.. and of course the silly practices.. i also hate it.... err- 4get about it. the thing i wanted to say is.. even though the tides turn, she's always there for me. i'm really confused big time. BIG time..

        things don't really last forever.. i knew it, why the heck am i searching for it. I'm a big failure of society. Why am i thinking like this, what's wrong with me..i don't get it. All of a sudden, i lost everything. I lost interest in winning.. i lost interest in studying.. i lost interest in learning.. i dont want to study anymore.. i lost my self-confidence... i lost my passion for taekwondo.. but one thing i still keep.. it's what my heart keeps that's why it still beats as of this moment.. this one thing has the power to change the world. my world that i live in. A small message from her ignites my circuits, gives me the reason to live. In spite of all the things i have been through, i know this one is so true.. i miss her but i couldn't have her. Maybe that's just how life is.. i got to accept it.     i love you

                      The time now is 4:46am according to the digital clock that I can see at the lower right of my screen. You might be asking me why the heck am I awake at this moment in time? Well to tell you honestly, I could not sleep. What could be the reason for this? I just had my UPCAT test and now I should feel relaxed. Because it’s over. But no, there’s still another reason why I can’t sleep. My sub-conscious mind tells me to go online and check out my dear friend’s blogspot. I always think about this friend. maybe she's the reason i could not sleep. And indeed it was so timely that I saw what I needed to see.

                dis evening will soon end. a brighter tomorrow will reveal itself upon him. but the part he enjoyed the most is because she remembered. he thought she had forgotten about it, but no, she indeed thought of him. and he was so happy. he wants to see her. he wants to be with her. tomorrow he will ask her out. what would happen? we don't know yet. knowing the fact that he still has to take the most important test in his life, he is still thinking of her. it's always been her. if only she knew... his destiny awaits and his heart will wait...

      this saturday, he will have a hard tym on concentrating on the test. you might ask why? well it's been one of the greatest mysteries our universe has known since the dawn of men.. the phenomenon of love.. being lovestruck can change his life. it has affected him in ways you would not imagine. he could see her. Be with her. Look at her but it all stops there. He cannot have her. or can he? up to now , he has been asking himself that very same question. and he'll not be contended until he finds out the truth. Could they go beyond that line of friendship and advance to something they've always dreamed of...       ... only in his dreams.                Gretil, i miss you.lol. = p    * "he" in the post pertains to my close friend*   * if you believe in me? *
