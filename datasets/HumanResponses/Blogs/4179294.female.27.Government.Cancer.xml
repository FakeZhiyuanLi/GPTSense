       so the meeting this morning was supposed to start at 9.. because my immediate superior was going out, so they moved it to 11am. 11am came and went... we finally started the meeting at 11.30.. hehehe.. all praise En. "Hitler" (that's what i call my boss in private)...  my director (this one, i'll refer to Big Branch aka Big Boss) spent about an hour   lecturing   us on what he gathered from the talk we  all  attended last Monday at HQ. however, they say that you should treat yourself like an empty glass when it comes to knowledge.. so i let what he said "flow" over me.. i did get a better understanding of what a balanced scorecard is supposed to do for our organization.  i'm late for  German Class  but i guess i'm addicted to blogging.  *chuckles* . so anyway... Hitler, Big Branch & Abang Long (my colleague) will be leaving for Bukit Merah Lake Town Resort tomorrow to present the paper they've (Abg Long, actually) prepared. teehehe. i now understand what they will present and i'm kinda looking forward to finding the results of their discussion there.  i don't envy Abg Long at all. they'd probably start discussions at 8am and sleep at 12am. poor Abg Long.  back to the meeting - i was starving!! i didn't eat much of the cakes we ordered for the meeting, was busy taking notes and answering Big Branch's questions.  (as to why i call him Big Branch.. well.. let's just say he's distantly related to Michelle Branch). teeheheh.  a little updating of what's going on... what we (the officers) have accomplished and we were done by lunch. * exhales relievedly*   that's all, i think. not very interesting, but then i didn't get more work, so that's ok. hehehehe.  later!!

       i've decided to start a blog on the meetings/serious discussions i attend.  maybe this will help me keep my head screwed on straight. hahahaha.  so, the meeting was held at a very nice office (but i'm not telling you where, hahaha!). they were a bit stingy with the food, but besides that... i guess it's ok.  i liked the chairman. he was direct, polite, funny at times and to the point. we didn't linger much - just discussed the important issues and  that was it ! the issues i raised were about the signboards, facilities for the inabled, security passes, and parking spaces - i really hate it when other ppl park in my space. i mean,  hello!!!!  do you  mind ???  when i got back to the office, i reported back to my boss. he wasn't really happy about our parking spaces being used by unauthorised persons. i nodded, listened to him gripe about it, listen to him telling me of the complaints he got from the boss, shrugged and went back to my room to dole out letters to the building manager. what really got to me was that.. the building manager didn't even come to the meeting!!  he didn't even send a representative!!   between rushing to complete reports, minutes, going for german classes and now blogging, is it any wonder that by the time i reach home in the evening, i'm pooped?  we have another meeting today - to discuss the papers to be presented at our organizations' strategy planning retreat. * chuckles * this should prove   interesting  , nicht war?? i'll just listen and try not to fall asleep. * giggle *. sometimes the issues they raise are  so  silly and irrelevant.  of course, there are meetings which i enjoy attending and everything gets done. but sometimes you have silly meetings that you have to endure.  later - i better check if my boss is back.

      i skipped German Class yesterday. (kit pauses to the sound of reproachful gasps). hey, i had a bad day!! i wanted to get some work done and hang out with my best gal pal... let's call her...  cookie ... (since she complains that i bandy her real name around so much)... hahaha..  oh, and just to jot this down.. the other party invovled in the accident i was in yesterday has been harrasing my mother and me through our handphones. what sillies. i'm not quite sure about mom... but i haven't been responding at  all  despite all the provocation. if things get too sticky, i guess i'd have to make a police report on this harrasment.   i mean.. hello!! just cos your  daddy  or your  boyfriend  knows some sergeant in the police force doesn't mean you can bully to get your way in everything. i'm not going to pay for your car. the accident wasn't completely my fault... go claim insurance la.   so, if you guys hear that i've been murdered or killed in the next few weeks/months, you have  suspects. the other party's " abang ipar "aka brother-in-law/boyfriend/male relative/friend who's been harrasing me. and the others la.. the big sister, the driver herself.. her younger sister.. their handphone numbers are in my sim card. btw, i've already mentioned to an officer of the police force and the sergeant who took my statement that the other side has been calling me up demanding for money or that i pay for their car's repairs. i was polite but firm. i was  thinking  some stuff, but i  didn't  say it to the caller. it was the guy, btw. i'm still not sure what he's doing getting caught up in all this.   and i actually got an sms from them last night, asking me why is my mother invovled in all this.. that i'm not "spoting". hello?? it's   sporting  , btw... do you have eyes? can you use them? tchah!!! so, they tried to provoke me by saying i'm not sporting and that my mother's stupid and i'm stupid.. that we're not cultured and we don't have manners... bla bla bla. i was thinking to myself... hmm... uneducated, arrogant and idiotic. not bad for a whole family and boyfriend.  i was also laughing at them. yes, laughing. because  they    got the guy (who claimed he was her brother/brother-in-law) but whom i think is just someone's boyfriend to call   ME   up  and ask for money. come on.. using a guy to deal with a woman when  you're a woman yourself ? that's not just low. that's    COWARDLY  .        anyways...on a more cheerful note...   cookie   and i went to midvalley yesterday evening to have dinner. we did the usual in the car, dance to music, sing out loud, talk about outrageous stuff.  it was after dinner when we were ambling aimlessly in midvalley that one of the most interesting subjects came up -    do men appreciate women who are sexually aggresive?    maybe i should explain. what we meant by sexually aggresive would be women who know what they want and when they want it.  would men be comfortable with women who knew what they want and how they want it?    cookie   and i always complain to each other how we'll probably marry guys who are nice, suitable (in our parents' eyes) and a total bore in bed.  at the end of our outing, the judgment was : some men would be horrified to discover that their chosen ones did know about sex... and unless we found the sporting, cool ones, we're doomed to marry conservatives. ( you know what they say about conservatives, right? they wouldn't change their underwear if they could help it ).  personally, i think things like this would have to be explored together. having been with a strong minded individual.. who's very supportive and  fun , i know what it's like to laugh about stuff like this together. besides, all those romance books  by amanda quick and bla bla bla is pretty educational.    by the way... ****, if you're reading this, (and i know you are, hahaha) AIRTIC, liebchen. argh. this is what i meant about not being able to say "no". not to another person, but to myself. oh well... the more love i send out, the better.    i've decided on something really  big  during my "blue funk", as   zyrin   puts it. i will be friends with guys who are interesting.. but i'd really like to stay single for a while. it wouldn't be fair to start a relationship with someone else when i'm not really ready for it. right now, all i can offer is friendship, maybe go out and date.. but committment i  cannot  give.  yeah... things could change. but not just yet. i'm not ready yet. i'm so glad i had time to think and consider stuff... before things happen and i cannot take them back.. or..    tarik balik , as the malay phrase goes.  another subject close to   cookie     and my heart would be chocolates.. (chocolates!!!) and other "feel good" food.. like.. cookies, and.. ice blended berried treasure...you know, food like that.  somebody   wondered if orgasms would be better than chocolate chip cookies..  how did that discussion start? actually   cookie   started it. she bit into a butterscotch pecan cookie and started moaning out loud in the middle of midvalley. i was worried some people might think that Famous Amos had put some aphrosidiac in them cookies. heheheh. or that we were a lesbian couple doing stuff and get arrested for it. so i told her to keep it down.  what was i thinking? this is   cookie   we're talking about here!!! keep it down? she just giggled and went on munching, after a final (and exceptionally loud & expressive) moan. i just rolled my eyes and prayed for patience.    cookie     and i made plans for this saturday. we hope our dear gf   coolchick   would be able to join us too...   coolchick   has a really cool satria and is usually kind enough to send us back home. i  love  hanging out with the girls. hehehehe.    cookie   loves being called "cookie". she thinks it's erotic. would anyone like to comment on that? yes? no? yes? hehehe. tell me what you think.   cookie   will be online too, once in a while.  in fact, if i can get her off her lazy @ss and write something, i'll post up  cookie's  thoughts here too. whaddaya say,   cookie  ?  well, it's back to the grindstone.  y'all come back now, y'hear?

      FYI.. (to those who are interested la) yours truly was on medical leave yesterday. yes, your ever-lovely, wonderful & vivacious blogger was unwell... reasons cited are P&amp;C, and will only be divulged to certain individuals. the rest of you can wonder. (if you guys even wonder what i was sick of, that is). so, on to today's ramblings. (note:   zyrin    rants.  kitty    rambles).     tak best betul la minggu ni. memula semalam sakit. pastu pagi ni..   sebelum sampai ofis..   dah accident. salah sapa? kit rasa salah dua2.. tapi maybe pemandu lagi sorang tu salah lebih skets la..  accident kat roundabout dekat ofis.. so, lepas accident (dia langgar kit dari tepi).. kit pun lay-by kat tepi jalan.. makcik dua2 org tu.. turun2 terus tinggi2 suara...   ape, ko ingat aku suka sangat la keta  ko  langgar aku?  makcik drebar tu kata kit bawak laju.  fine.  adik makcik ( passenger  la nih) kata dorang dah  pandang  kit masa nak masuk kanan tu..     hekeleh.  ko ingat ape? zaman ni org sempat tengok ke sapa yg bawak keta? ingat ni zaman 1940an ke, dik oii??? org bawak keta.. bukan naik kuda, jalan kaki, naik keta lembu.. mana nak pandang2  pemandu   keta? pasal tu la dicipta  SIGNAL keta ....    tapi part kit tanya, apasal tak bagi  signal..  boleh ke dia jawab... "i tak payah bagi signal, sebab semua org tahu lane tu boleh belok kanan".   ape, ko ingat org boleh baca ke otak ko tu?? ke ko ingat Malaysia ni  bapak  ko punya sorang??  pastu, mintak2 duit. kit jawab ah, ape nak duit2 nih? dua2 salah.. cik gi repair keta cik and bayar sendiri, saya gi repair keta saya, saya bayar sendiri. dia tak nak.. dia nak   kit   bayar repair keta dia...    banyak la ko punya cantik!!! kalau ko lelaki pastu handsome macam  Jason Behr  pun aku tak nak bayar. (tapi mintak no. hp tu ye la). hahahaha.     ha... masa  ni, kerani ngan driver kit dah turun dari  office  naik  pajero..  dorang dengar2 je.. pastu  uncle (driver)  tekankan la.. mmg salah kalau tukar  direction  keta tak bagi  signal . dia  argue  balik, apsal kit tak bagi  signal ?    kit peliks la. seingat kit, kat kelas memandu dulu ajar, selalunya terus tak yah bagi signal. yg nak pusing kiri/kanan    mesti   bagi signal. dorang ni gi skolah memandu ape ah??? aku cadangkan lesen mengajar memandu utk skolah tu ditarik je.    aku dah naik malas dengar bebelan/sungutan/rungutan "manja" makcik dua org tu... pastu pakcik  suggest  kitorang  go our own ways.  aku mintak no hp si makcik memandu tu. dia bleh   tak nak bagi????   dia soh adik dia bag dia punya no hp.. hello!! sapa yg bawak keta ni? ko ke adik ko?? adik ke? aku tengok lain sangat je ropanye... adik ke? yg adik tu putih melepak... kakak dia gelap... tapi muka pun jauh benor bezanye... lantak korang la.. adik ke,  life-partner  ke, anak murid kelas memasak ke.. suka hati la. yg penting, memula dorang nak buli kit, sebab kit sorang depa dua org. pasal tu kit panggey kerani ngan drebar office turun.. biar dorang tengok driver dia sapa. mana la tahu benda ni drag on kat court..  at least my side  ada la saksi.    so after the accident i went home to pick my parents up..  yelah... nak gi  report police ... kalau tak bawak skali karang merajuk.. dorang rasa kit tak perlukan dorang lagi.. so bawak la.  at the police station, everything went pretty ok la. except the fact that the sergeant made a blunder. he thought that i was the other party who  had called in earlier to ask for favors . my father's face was like a thundercloud...  pilih bulu ke wei!?!    bengang2 pun... selesaila nak report2 ni.. pergi  KLCC to get some food. went to Burger King... queque  bukan main lama.. ramai org.. matsaleh kat depan  jumped queque.. my mom s abar lagi... kit dah kat meja.. tolong "book".  dad had went to answer nature's call.  it was mom's turn and she used malay to place her order. the bratty girl behind the counter pretended not understand malay. mom repeated her order twice and still she pretended not to understand malay. the girl's name is  YAN  by the way. a chinese girl .. with an exxagerated (and painful) american accent.  tetiba this makcik from the next line (who was still queing) told the girl to not be so "mengada-ngada, takkan la tak faham melayu!".  YAN  turned a bright pink and started to take my order. then her arrogance reared it's ugly head again. she told my mother haughtily... " makcik , please don't use the word "set" while ordering or else i will be sacked. this is by the manager's order". mom just told  YAN  that she couldn't care less. mom got her order and dropped the food off at our table. dad was back then, so i loitered behind mom and listened in as mom asked a few pointed questions to the manager on duty at the time. her name is  YATI  and is very good. so, in the end, Yati promised to have a word with ms-my-name-is-yan-n-i'm-so-bloody-stuck-up. plus, the manager assured my mother that there are no orders saying that if  customers  mention the word "set" the worker will get sacked.  this  YAN  girl... i wonder if she's been using her ears lately?  at the same time my mom was talking to yati, 2 other customers came up and added their opinions. one lady said that the staff in this outlet was the most arrogant and  pilih bulu  among all the other few outlets she's been to.  i silently applauded mom, who still looked huffy and kinda mad. she cooled down while she ate, thank God. hehehe.  this reminded me of the I-Robot preview that Hotlink offered to Hotlink members last 29 July 2004. The show was supposed to start at 7pm, so my dear old dad went and waited from 6.05pm at TGV. there was nothing set-up (not like spiderman2). when i arrived at 6.20pm, there was still nothing ready. i waited until 6.30pm then i went up to one of the hotlink girls who were waiting prettily at their table (in front of TGV KLCC) for goodness knows what. when i asked what was going on, they said they don't know. when i asked that they ask  someone who does know , one of them answered, "we are only here to give out passes, the rest we're not in charge" in her irritating chinese-accented english. not that i'm against those who speak with accents, it's just that she was looking down her nose at me when she said it, paying particular attention to my tudung and my baggy clothes..   so what's with my tudung? and it's my choice not to wear clothes that look painted on!! (incidentally, she was wearing one of those skirts that barely covered her @ss when she got up to walk. and they say they don't use women for advertising anymore. my foot!!   so i smiled grimly at her, and said "i don't care. i'm a hotlink member and therefore  YOUR customer.  you  ARE  customer service, aren't you?   and if you don't get up and ask someone  who  DOES  know what's going on, i  promise  you there will be problems arising". needless to say, she got off her skinny little fanny and led me straight to the horse's mouth. (or the horse, rather). so i met one of the event managers... who were in discussion with TGV. apparently, TGV " overlooked " the fact that the preview would start at 7pm and not 9pm. they got " confused " and thought it started at 9pm like spidey2.    what a load of crap to used as a reason.   so... they announced that the preview would only start at 9pm. hello??!! my dad is about 60plus and  cannot  be expected to stand on his feet for that long!! so i made enough of a ruckus (and was joined by the other angry hotlink members) and so, a few of us got to watch the movie at that time..  i mean, even a big organization like TGV screws up. oopsie!! what a blunder. heheheh.  that ends kit's ramblings for today.  thanks and come again, folks!!

      my typist is supposed to attend a course in JB starting tmrw and ending on Friday. she looks mutinous today. i get the creepy feeling that she's likely to drive a dagger into my back everytime i walk past her. i'm puzzled. she was informed about the course i think a few weeks ago. and she seemed fine yesterday (probably because she wanted me to support her request for a transfer back to her home state). oh well, the perils of having subordinates.... you get used to being hated.  i'm better today, although i'm still feeling a bit "out" with the world. i guess withdrawing... or hibernating is my way to center myself. i'd go crazy if i couldn't. thanks for understanding, guys. and thanks for all the messages & phone calls to those who were concerned enough to ask me how i felt.  i was at breakfast with an officemate (meeting cancelled today) and i bumped into one of the guys i had a "fling" with at senior high school. he seemed so grown up, so.. much more handsome (and he lost weight!! about 15 kg). but he denied being married. so that made me lose any respect i had for him in the first place. ok, ok.. to give himt he benefit of the doubt, maybe the source of the information isn't that reliable. i  did  hear it by the grapevine. but it was my own girlfriend who told me the news. and she's hardly ever wrong. still.. she isn't perfect, i know.  he gave me his number verbally (we both didn't have our mobile phones with us) but i'm not sure if i'm going to call him. maybe i'll call him to reconfirm the number (if he  could  be trusted to have given me his real number and not one he made up on the spot). my friend and i organize reunions and it would be useful to have his number. he keeps in touch with a lot of our old schoolmates.  but if there is a reunion, i don't think i'm going. why? well, because i'm not really interested in keeping in touch with my old senior high schoolmates. i always felt out of place (and there were only a precious few that i felt close to) and i couldn't wait for school to finish.  wait a minute.  oh, message received from a guy i've sorta been going out with (as friends) for the past two years. mr. M kindly messaged me, asking where exactly is my office and if i could call him, as he's in the area. so i did.. and we made plans to meet up later. what is it about today? i keep seeing men from my past.  anyway, talking abt the old-flame-that-never-burned i met this morning (hahahaha). i did call him up, just to reconfirm. i was thinking while talking to him.. i must be getting diplomatic as i get older.. i didn't say anything out of small talk.  i received an email to my friend who broke up with his gf... he told me that she wanted more attention and time than he could give her. she's a student, he's working... apparently she wanted him with her all the time. * sigh *  how  silly & selfish  could someone be? it seemed to me she's saying to him, "when i have classes, it's ok for you to do other stuff, but when i don't, and i know you don't have  work , then you'd better be with me". so it's ok for  her  to spend time with  her friends & family  but  NOT  ok for him? it's so unfair.  i thought about it for a few moments. from all the stories i've heard and seen, it seems that more women than men do this kinda thing. of course, i know  there are men who are like that too . but i think more women than men demand for attention. maybe its subconscious. men used to leave the cave (which represents safety) a lot back in the cavemen days. women would stay at home, not knowing if their men would ever come back to them. not to mention the wars in which women were not allowed to take up arms and fight, just stay at home, do the chores and hope their fathers/husbands/brothers/sons/loved ones come back.  talking about fathers... i watched dad last night, as he went about his way. he's so changed from the dad i knew while growing up. i know i've never really known my dad, not as a person. when i was small, he used to put me up on his shoulders and carry me about. i was his darling girl... i could do no wrong. he, like mom wanted (and still do) the best for me. if the best meant being grounded and scolded, that was what he'd do. he'd sometimes lose his temper with my brother, because my brother tends to be very vocal..  dad's gentleness shows itself so clearly nowadays, especially when dealing with my nephew, syaqirein. dad's so thin now. i wish he'd eat more. although he's so quiet, the house seems empty to me when he's not around.  his presence is always felt at home.. at least to me. while mom makes her presence felt by the "noises" she makes as she goes about our home, dad's silent but steady presence is felt by the marks he leaves in a room - the fan is switched off, the curtains adjusted to let the light in or keep the night out.. clothing brought in frm the line and heaped carefully at the edge of my bed... shoes and watnots properly arranged at the shoe rack... sometimes you’d hear his cough, or the firm steps he takes as he walks about.  it hurts when i hear him cough. and it hurts that i can’t do anything about it.  dad’s one of the reasons I have control over my emotions. although he himself is hot tempered, he’s always cautioning me to not give in to my own temper. he has really good ideas, my dad does. and the thing I admire about him the most is how  through  he is. he’d think things through and then voice them. being rather impulsive, i’ve sometimes cursed my errant tongue…i wish i was a bit more like dad in that aspect.    so you see.. being in hibernation for me is a very good thing. i think about lots of stuff... i like being alone sometimes. it helps clear my head. thanks again for understanding, guys.    auf wiedersehen.

      i'm feeling quirky today. someone i love very very much gave me the Corrs cd yesterday... via a mutual friend. thanks, ****. and to answer your question, yes, it's still a.i.r.t.ic for me, even after all this time.  my fav song would be  Humdrum    Hey you're too true to be good And I'm to bad to pretend Transparent and  transfixed, I'm uncool  Heart beat you're looking at me Must stop I'm  letting you see This isn't how I want it to be  I have vision like no  other So romantic you'll discover  I wanna take you for granted   Drift while you're talking Bathe while you're downstairs And chat on  the phone  Fall sleep before bedtime Pass in the hallway Forget  your birthday And shrink all your clothes  (I wanna)  This is  every girl's dream No milk left for your tea Baby's crying louder than  me Who lost the keys of your car Sorry that would be me I'd wake up  only I'm not asleep  I have vision of another So romantic you'll  discover  I wanna take you for granted Drift while you're talking   Bathe while you're downstairs And chat on the phone  Fall sleep  before bedtime Pass in the hallway Forget your birthday And shrink  all your clothes  (I wanna) (I wanna)  Did I say that out loud?   i just got an sms from a person whom i think of as a younger brother. he broke up with his gf last night. which came as a  big  surprise to me cos they (i mean the relationship) seemed fine the last time we talked.  i called him immediately - he  sounded  alright but i'm not too sure. someone i know once started drinking because he was forced to break up with his gf of 4 years. but then they got back together 6 mths later, so that's all right. my point is (and yes, i do have you, you impatient person!) is that people do crazy shit when they're upset.      i'm going into hibernation mood today. there's so much to think about. so much to do (naturally).  talking to    zyrin    today really made me realise that i   have serious issues   to solve.     so here it is. kitty is taking time off to think things through. i may not be available for some time. a few days. a few hours. who knows.  i have a headache from all this thinking i've been doing.  i mean, the weekend was pretty good, but i don't wanna go into that for now.  kit is feeling under pressure for purely personal, not professional reasons... things seem pretty bad and i'm slipped into of my darker moods. i don't really feel like talking to anyone about anything right now...

       There's something 'bout the way You looked at me Made me think for a  moment that Maybe we were meant to be Living our lives separately And It's strange that things change when I've been wanting you so  desperately  Oh, I cannot ignore it, I keep giving in, But I  should know better 'Cause there was something 'bout the way you looked at me And it's strange that things change when I've been wanting you so  desperately  You looked my way, you said "you frustrate me" Like  you're thinking of lines and times when you and I were you and me You took  our chance out on the street Well you missed my chance and chances are It won't be coming back to me  Oh, I cannot ignore it, I keep  giving in, But I should know better 'Cause there was something 'bout the  way you looked at me And it's strange that things change when I've been  wanting you so desperately So desperately...  I keep giving in, But I should know better I keep giving in, But I should know better So desperately    I want you so desperately   ====>>>> Michelle Branch - Desperately   God, why is it so hard to say "No"... sometimes in your life, you meet that one person that you  know  you can't be with. But you can't seem to say no. And after everything is over.. you still think about him sometimes... you know if you keep on with it, you'll just hurt yourself... Oh, the lack of willpower just irks me sometimes.  i know that there are somethings that are just bad for me. but i can't help wanting to keep on thinking about it.. about the past.  hmm... i wonder what  bear  is doing. probably asleep.  what a slugabed. hehehe.  last post for this week it's the weekend...tonight will be the last AF2 concert. i certainly hope zahid wins. because i think he's talented and is a good performer.. plus i  like  him and the way he is.  the girl who gets him is one lucky girl...  i never fully understood what my teachers must've went through until i started to tutor some girls.. my cousin & her friends (in Form 4) and a family friend's daughter (Year 5). it isn't so bad with the older girls, they're 16 and quite serious about their studies.. well, almost all. i wish my cousin is more serious about her studies, like her friends... but i digress (yes, i do that a lot).  i get some pocket money from all this tutoring (about 6 hours a week) but it's not consistent.. i like teaching. the little warm glow i get when i see understanding in someone's eyes is sometimes payment enough. people think English is such an easy subject to teach. but how can you instill an appreciation for poetry and arts? or how to do show them the difference between knowing why a certain adjective is used and just going by "sound"?  i never appreciated my teachers enough. how horrible of me.  i wrote to my big sister Kathy yesterday. she's a very talented woman who's bringing up 3 teenagers (what a saint! teehehe!) and a husband. oh dear, did i just say that? hehehe, sorry Al. what i meant was, Kath &amp; Al are bringing up 3 teenagers - Mike, Amy &amp; Amanda. we haven't talked for some time, me and Kath, so i'm just catching up with her. she tells me that some days she doesn't even turn the PC on. she must be really busy.  hmm..i don't know if i could survive without the internet for more than a week. oh, well, got some work to do.. and i'm off for the weekend after this. have a good one, everyone!!

      teehehe. just got of the phone with   zyrin  . boy.. is that girl lucky or what?? two guy friends who fits her description (and kinda mine too, incidentally) of a delicious guy...  broad, good shoulders, tall... naughty enough for the spirit and yet decent enough to be with. intelligent, witty... naughty... (oh, have i repeated that? sorry!! heheh..)  what more could a girl ask for? having the same faith, single and working goes unsaid la...  but then, i was only teasing   zyrin   when i said to her...  "He hath caught mine eye, rin.  Give him to me !!". oh, alright... just  half-teasing  then. * chuckles wickedly *  last night i had a fight with the  Queen.  as usual, nothing i say or do satisfies her. it's like i'm expected to live my life out according to  her  plans and not according to what i want. but i made it up with mom this morning though. * grin *  i think i've been talking a lot to a certain someone lately. which is kinda strange for me. i mean, i am talkative, but what people don't notice is that, when i'm babbling (at the office, etc) i'm not really saying anything  important  and close to my heart. but with this friend i am. i think it's strange. am i ready for this kind of closeness?    i still have doubts though. lots of them, to be honest about it.    one of the things we talked about were regrets. i read somewhere once that you should leave life with no regrets. i have so many - regrets over my own actions.. and regrets over things that has happened in my life that i had no control over. i wonder, does any among us live their lives with no regrets at all?  in a few days time, insya-Allah.. i would be settling a few debts that have been hanging over my head. so i'm feeling a bit upbeat... and relieved.    setiap masalah ada jalan penyelesaiannya.. as long as we have faith in Him...     i pray that all my friends' problems will get solved soon too. * smile *  about two years ago, i watched the movie "A Walk To Remember". the movie was based on the book of the same title by Nicholas Sparks. i loved the movie so much, i went out and bought  both  the book  and  the soundtrack.  there's a really cool song on the soundtrack which has two versions : one is by Switchfoot and the other is by Mandy Moore... it's called "Only Hope" and it helped me get through a lot during one of the darkest times of my life. i listened to it again last night.. it made me smile.  it's actually about how you give up all your hopes and dreams and trust to God. so the "you" in the song isn't really a man/woman/person.. it's God.  oh,   zyrin  's here. time to go for lunch!!  l8r...

       i still can't get into jiwang.org. from yesterday afternoon. i don't  think  the administrators have blocked access to it... i mean, they have other things to do than to check who's been surfing what.. plus,   zyrin   can't get into it too, so i guess it's the server problem.   bear  starts work today. i hope he likes the job (though i doubt it) and i hope he won't be too tired by tonight. i don't like canvassing jobs. i think i'd hate that kinda job. but.. to each his own.  yesterday evening i was among the last to leave the office (again). i left at about 6.40pm, and was walking down the single flight of stairs in front of the building entrance to get to my car. there was a lady standing there, and we smiled at each other as i walked past. her handphone rung, and she started talking into it. the lady was in her late 40s.. and i noticed a young man sneaking up behind her, also talking on the phone. he tapped her shoulder and she started and turned behind. they both laughed. from the pretty, heartwarming picture that scene made, i knew that they were mother and son. and that they had a loving and strong relationship. strong enough for the son to tease his mother that way.  since i had no classes, was in no major rush to get home, i took the Jalan Ampang route to get home. it was congested, no doubt.. but it wasn't that bad. i like driving alone in the car. i'm kinda ashamed to admit that ... i kinda like traffic jams. i don't mind getting caught in a traffic jam if i don't have an appointment  and  if i have plenty of petrol in my tank. i get to think things over, listen to Lite & Easy... these past few days, it seems like i'm always thinking about relationships. reading the   Mists of Avalon   doesn't help either. it's all about relationships too, that book. * sigh *  while i was driving, i thought about how much i loved my nephew. he's only three, but already quite independant. he wants to do everything himself. but he still snuggles up to me when i get home from work.. he still sits in my lap and sometimes fall asleep in my arms. i'm beginning to think that i should get married quickly, just to have a baby of my own in my arms. then that part of me, that's a little bit  wary  of committment screams at me. but i still want a child!!  maybe it's my maternal instincts screaming at me to procreate.      i thought about the relationship that a mother has with her child. it's so.. fragile, and at the same time, it's something that cannot be broken. to carry someone under your heart for almost a year, to endure such pain to bring that person into the world... is it any wonder that mothers are so demanding of their children sometimes? for that time being.. the time it takes for a mother to carry a child in her womb, they are as  one being . not one person, but two people in the same "shell".  it's a complex and sometimes painful relationship.. it gets even more when some mothers set such demanding standards on their children.. especially if they   see themselves   in that child. mothers are so protective. they want only the best for their children, sometimes to the point of not seeing that that "child" is a grown man or woman.  i wonder how many times i've hurt my mom with the things i've said, or the expression, attitude i've shown to her. countless of times... and all in the bid for freedom. for a little respect from one adult to another. but like that little boy whom i rocked and carried in my arms last night will probably never be a grown man to me, i know i will  never  be a grown woman to my mother. no matter what my age. i sometimes wish i had the courage to tell my mother:    " i'm sorry, mom. i'm sorry for the things i've done and the    things i will do in the future   . i never meant to hurt you... but i'm grown up now... and i can't do things the way you want me to do them all the time. i can't be the daughter you want me to be, i can only   be me  .."           i love my mother so much.. sometimes i wish she'd see  me  and not the woman she wants me to be.

       I'm not looking for someone to talk to   I've got my friends, I'm more than okay   I've got more than a girl could wish for   I live my dreams, but it's not all they say    c/o: Still I believe (I'm missing...)   I'm missing something real   I need someone who really sees me    (Don't want to wake...)   Don't want to wake up alone anymore   Still believing you'll walk in my door   All I need is to know it's for sure   Then I'll give all the love in the world    I've often wondered if love's an illusion   Just to get you through the loneliest days   I can't criticise it, I had no hesitations   My imagination just stole me away    repeat c/o    (Guitar/Tin whistle solo)    Love's for a lifetime, Not for a moment   So how could I throw it away   I'm only human, And life's more colder   With no one to love me that way    Yeah, I need someone who really sees me    repeat c/o     Sometimes it's hard to know... if you're with that person because you really love him/her, or because you're afraid of being alone?   Food for thought - love breaks and love divides, love laughs and love can make you cry.. love can give, and love can take away.  ..

         hola! hallo! guten tag! bonjour!  ok. enough showing off already. * grin*   last evening started off pretty much as usual.. i went for german class, i went home.. took my nephew and sister-in-law out to mcd's... i spent time with my da - we watched the shows he likes the most.. like.. the muslim forum. in between reading the   Mists of Avalon    by Marion Zimmer Bradley.  i   love   reading that book. seriously.  but i digress.....  later that we watched astro's channel 4 - there's this show hosted by Datuk Dr. Fadzilah Kamsah (i admire this guy a lot..) the discussion for the day was something kinda relevant to me - at my age (and in this society) i suppose i'm past my time to be married. i mean, i should've been married about.. oh.. two years ago? heheh.  the gist of what i got from the discussion (and tips) from the revered and most excellent Datuk Dr. is as follows : -         Hati yang bersih.    Berdoa untuk jodoh yang baik      selepas sembahyang.    Berdoa untuk sahabat yang      masih bujang utk mendapat jodoh yang baik.    Buangkan sikap negatif    Tetapkan tempoh or tarikh      bila anda ingin berkahwin           Datuk Dr. Fadzillah mengumpamakan badan/hati manusia sebagai "magnet". The conclusion, hati yang bersih akan dapat menarik "jodoh" seseorang. So, from now on, try to stop hating people. hate makes it harder for your "jodoh" to find you. In fact, it might even repel your "jodoh". So if you hate anyone, forgive them. Kinda hard to do, i know. * sigh *  No. 2 tu simple la   kan   nak faham... No. 3 tu... Apa yang i faham, kalau kita doakan kawan/sahabat kita mendapat jodoh yang baik, malaikat di sisi kita akan mengaminkan doa kita dan sekaligus (skema nye ayat....) mendoakan utk kita sekali...Ok, bagi bahagian ini, kurang pasti sikit. Tak sure la pulak kalau malaikat itu akan mendoakan kita skali atau macam citer Chain Reaction.. hehehe.  untuk buang sikap negatif tu, contohnya, takut kegagalan yg lalu berulang, atau kegagalan rumahtangga ibubapa menjadi penghalang untuk mencuba memberi peluang kepada "jodoh".. kena beringat la.. kegagalan dulu tu, let it stay in the past. yg ada sekarang ni, bagi la dia peluang utk buktikan diri.  bagi yang tetapkan tempoh itu, Datuk Dr. Fadzillah maklum, kalau kita set (contohnya) tahun depan untuk berkahwin, itu adalah doa and secara automatic attitude kita akan berubah.. we would be more..  attractive  to those around us, maybe because of the increased confidence, willingness to be more open...  dad and i discussed this as the show was going on. he said "it doesn't hurt to try, especially the doa part.. tak rugi apa2...". he wasn't telling  me  personally, he was just voicing his opinion. the thing i love about my parents is that they've never pressured me to get married. in fact, they told me that.. if i don't find anyone suitable, they won't pressure me.  shim went through some serious pressure from her mom a few weeks back about this. the situation is, she's friends with a guy.. a nice guy. but there is no chemistry... but since they're been going out together (as frens tho) her mother wants her to make a choice.  so the question shim asked me  "should i settle for second best? grab whatever choice that i have in front of me? am i different from everyone else, just because i enjoy being single?" .  i felt dismayed when shim told me about what had happened. i felt for her. i know what it's like to feel that you're different and abnormal, just because you're enjoying life.. but as i told my dearest best fren, "there is no shame in enjoying life... and you shouldn't just ' grab whatever/whoever ' there is in your life to be your lifepartner, you deserve the "best".  after watching Datuk Dr. Fadzillah's show, shim and i talked again. i shared with her everything i heard and digested from the show - because i want her to be happy with someone good enough for her. shim is beautiful, funny, intelligent. she has principles and is not afraid to stand up for them. shim has confidence in herself - and it shows. so, yes, i do believe that she deserves the best... but like i told her this morning...  she has to give those suitors a chance to prove themselves .. and maybe give herself a chance to finally love again too.    as for myself.. well, i've always known i'm a bit of a committment-phobic. but i've decided to give that "someone" a chance.. i can't deny that we'd still need to get to know each other.. but so far.. my instincts tell me that he is what he seems to be.    i like him. i like him very, very, very much, and for right now, he's dear to me   .           and like i told shima.. i gotta give myself a chance at love too.    so this morning, i spoke to one of my girlfrens who i'd like to think of as a " kakak ". she's getting married next month, after a long and trying romance. i'm happy for her, and at the same time, i'm  so proud  of her. throughout all the adversity, the pain she went through.. to be with the man she knew she was in love with;  kna  showed tremendous faith in God and courage.  i think i'll listen to  kna 's advice. i  will  enjoy my time getting to know one of the more amazing persons i've ever met. i  will  have fun. teehehe.  i hope i don't freak anyone out. * wink *  to be continued....

      yesterday evening i posted a blog just before i left. i had felt as if something was chuckling evilly and reading over my shoulder as i was typing that post.  at dinner with my mom and sister-in-law last night, we talked about it.. the supernatural. how sightings of a"succubus" or pontianak have been reported the past few weeks in Kg. Baru, KL. how my brother "saw" things like that while we were growing up. how sometimes, late at night, when i'm left alone, i feel like something malicious is watching me as i go about our home. my mother doesn't like leaving me alone at home all night. she usually tells me to invite a friend or one of my cousins over. or, she asks me to sleep over at my aunt's home.  i remember one night, when i was 18, i was all alone. mom and dad went to perlis to attend a wedding, and the friend who was supposed to sleep over that night had something to do. so i slept alone, in the queen size bed (my brother was still in UK). it was about 3 or 4am when i woke up feeling freezing cold and thirsty. i was half-asleep and could barely keep my eyes open. there was someone sleeping next to me. i knew it was a "him", but it didn't alarm me. i just climbed over him and went downstairs for a drink. but as i was drinking, i remembered that i was alone at home. so who on earth was sleeping in my bed upstairs?  feeling a bit like one of the three bears in goldilocks, i crept upstairs with a hefty umbrella in my hand. i pushed the door open and sprang into the room. it was cold. it was freezing cold. i suddenly felt angry at the "person" toying with my fear. i slammed the door to my room shut behind me and went to sleep in my mother's room.  i think part of the beauty of growing up in a malay/asian culture is the exposure to things like these. i grew up knowing that my brother is not crazy when he turns pale and tells me he "sees" a spirit walking next to us in the park. i grew up knowing that when someone or something strange beckons to you to follow in the middle of the night, you don't.  there are a few types of spirits that i've encountered. the malicious type, the angry ones, the mischievious one, the sad and haunting ones. of all i've come across, i think it's the sad and haunting ones that frighten me the most. they start off being sad and asking you for help... but of course you usually don't know what they want, of if you do, it's almost impossible to help them. so they turn mean on you.. and they try to hurt you..  then, there's the type where they don't even seem to realise that they're dead. they just carry on with their routine...  i wonder if the people who "see" these spirits are blessed or cursed. it sure felt like we (my brother &amp; i) were  cursed  while we were growing up. but it faded once we left our teens. i wonder why. could it be that the lost of innocence also meant that the "sight" becomes less clear?

      how come when you're all alone in a building (make that a really old building) that you begin to remember all those creepy tales you hear about being in the office alone after office hours?  i seem to get the feeling that something fey is reading over my shoulder as i type this and chuckling evilly. *looks over shoulder tentatively*. nope, nothing there. well, nothing i can see, that is....  i've been busy with work since my last post, and now, it's after office hours so i thought i'd just drop by, create a new post and try to fix some stuff i want for my own blog - like links, images, forum... but i'm not very good at this so i don't like the way my blog looks at all.  i did download some of the nicer skins i found on the 'net, but since i have no experience at all about all HTML.. i got stuck. unless some nice person would like to suggest ways i c0uld create links and counters, etc, etc..? *chuckles*  actually, i was at modblog.com but i couldn't login so i "ran" and escaped here at blogger.com. teehehe. i'm not very loyal, am i?  ah.. i see my fren alhar is online. i think i'll go talk to him awhile....   *shudder* i still have that creepy feeling that something is behind me. I think i'll go home now. you guys have a good evening.  Guten Abend - Shonen Abend nacht!! :))

          Nein... ich spreche nicht Deutsch, aber ich   lerne   Deutsch!!    first post - God, i hope i don't make a mess out of this... between struggling to earn my pay, be a  dutiful   *kit makes a face at the word "dutiful"*  daughter, a great friend and finding myself as a person.. i thought.. "hey.. i should have a blog...".  a new acquaintance suggested that i have a blog.. i wondered why i listened to him instead of all those times i thought of starting one all by my little ole' self. hmmm.  i was told on saturday by my gal pal sal (uuu.. that rhymes...yes,  saturday...  when most decent people gets to sleep in and relax) at the bowling competition my bosses decided to have ( of course i'd HAVE to be there - i'm "mary jane"; maid of all work!)  that we'd all have to go to Lumut, Perak for the strategic planning session.   *sigh*  then , on the way home from bowling (all right, it wasn't  that  bad - teehehe) i realised i had misplaced/lost RM50. ok, so it isn't much, but it was the  only  money i had in my purse at that time! thank god i had my " spare"  money in my coin purse or else i wouldn't have gotten home without calling my mum.. and i would've gotten severely scolded for losing my money too!!  then today i was told i wasn't even invovled and so i  danced barefooted  in my own office for joy! plus,   ZYRIN,   my gal pal told me her silly old " bodoh-sombong"  (that's in Malay - i can't really translate that - sorry! hahaha) is getting transfered by next Monday or the first of September. hooray for   zyrin  .  i spoke to my lil' bro  alhar  today. he seems happy and cheerful.. maybe because of the wonderful news he had on friday. *smile*. i like being an aunt. i   might   spoil  alhar 's baby... but maybe i won't.. *chuckles wickedly* first babies are always petted. i think i'll wait for  alhar & iha's   second baby . hehehe. iha... belum dapat number 1... kak kitt dah cakap pasal number 2 ye?? sabar la iha ye...  oh yes - it's Merdeka Month in Malaysia!!! Independance Month in Malaysia. national flags everywhere... i love celebrating independance month. i know the older generation think we'll never appreciate the struggle they went through for independance.. but i'd like to think i do. i'd like to think we all do, and that we value the fact that we gained independance without any bloodshed.   bear  was in a bad mood last night. poor  bear . but he's better today, and is his usual upbeat self. i like talking to  bear . he's cool, funny.... hehehe. i better not say too much or he'll get  perasan  and will be utterly un bear able to be with. *smirks*. and he asks me why i call him bear. what's  perasan ? oh.. conceited. hehehe.  the reason why i put " Gehen wir raus! " as the title for this post is that i    want  to go out but i'm unable to.. i think i've overspent for this month, thanks to me being careless and losing that money, going out with my cousins and the girls... no more book shopping for this month!!  let's see how it looks, aigh t?
