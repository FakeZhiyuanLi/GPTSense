						   My sweet husband was in Iraq for over one year and he just returned home a few months ago.  I'm not sure if I can put into words what it is like to have your spouse gone to war for so long.  Every day was hard...it felt like someone was sitting on my chest and I couldn't really breathe...it was as if one of my arms and one of my legs was missing and also half of my brain.  It was scary and lonely and overwhelming.  I firmly believe that I would not have gotten through it without God and the love that only He can give, the peace and comfort and companionship that only HE can give.  I praise God that that deployment has ended and that He brought Wes home safe and together Wes and I thank God that He used Wes in such an awesome way. Wes loves to serve the Lord and America and I'm so glad he was able to make a difference in some Iraqi's lives. The pictures he brought home will move you to tears...and they clearly show what we are fighting for.  Wes would go back overseas in a heart beat to continue to put an end to terrorism, to free other nations and people and help others, and to try to spread peace by helping to eliminate evil.  I support him completely and as unbearable as another deployment may seem, I know God would get us through a hundred more if that was what was needed.  If everyone would do what they had to do to help others, the world would be a lot different.  I'm so very thankful to have Wes home.  I'm so thankful to him and to all those serving our country.  Wes comes from a family of Patriots and brave men who served and are serving our country.  His father, Stan, is a Sargent Major and has served in the military most of his life.  He works at MacDill Air Force Base and is trying to get deployed so he can go help his fellow soldiers overseas.    Wesley's brother Jason is also in the Army.  Jason has been in Afghanistan for about 8 months.  The good news is he will be returning to US soil in just a couple weeks!  We are all so excited that he will be back home soon.  Jason's wife Aly is an amazingly strong woman and she has made it through the deployment with such courage.  They have a two year old daughter and Aly gave birth to their second daughter four months ago.  Wes and I, along with Wesley's folks Stan and Anna, are all driving up to NC to welcome Jason home.  Watching Jason and Aly and their two babies reunite will be such a beautiful thing! Actually I feel odd to be there at that special moment for their family...but well thats just the way it's going to work out.  ;-)  So soon Aly will be joining me up here on CLOUD NINE!  Our husbands will be home safe for a while anyway, and we are grateful for that.    Some people's heros are people that are famous, rich, athletic, attractive, talented etc.  Like Pitt, McMan, Trump, Jorden, Barry, Carey, Jackson....  My heros are my husband, fathers, brother in laws, grandpas, uncles, cousins, friends, and also those I have not met...who choose to put their lives on the line, to protect, fight, and help others.  They have true servant hearts and they are the true definition of the word HERO.

						   One of my best friends, Cela, has a blog and I love reading about her life.  It's a great way to stay in touch even though we live so far apart.  I thought it would be good to create my own Blog so Cela and others can read about what is going on in my life as well.  Not sure if I will keep up with posting messages to my blog but we'll see how it goes.
