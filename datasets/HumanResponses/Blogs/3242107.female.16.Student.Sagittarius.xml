      this is one i wrote about chris when the whole thing with meg happened...  you hurt her so bad, you tore her whole world apart. when she first met you, she thought," heres a new start". but you didnt think. you just said "whatever". but the sad thing is, she thought youd be together forever. everyday and everynight, all she did was think of you, and just how happy she was. but because of you, her whole world turned upside down. that beautiful smile turned into a frown. those tears of joy, stopped falling, and new ones fell, but full of sadness. all the lies you told her, you probably thought,"oh she'll get over it". but its not that simple. shes not a little toy, one you cantoss around and play with whenever you want. shes a real person, she has feelings too. did you think of them? your real friends? the people who new the truth, but still stood behind you. i guess not. because if you had, you wouldnt have done it. you would have thought twice, about what you'd lose in the end.

      ok so i was going through some things and i found this book i used to write in when i was mad.. or just bored. at the beginning i was mad at a friend because it was like they dropped off the edge of the earth and didnt call me anymore, write me, or even say hi when they visited. i remember one time, it was valentines day, and when i was walking home , i looked ahead and saw them with someone, and just kept walking home figuring theyd come by and hang out like usual. but no... they didnt, so that prolly had something to do with some of the poems... but  yea... ok so heres something i wrote... a few ppl have read it, but i think only 2..k well here it is... i hate the way you make me feel. i hate the way you make life seem so real. i hate the way you make me smile, and make the small things seem worthwhile. i hate the way you make me laugh,i hate the way it feels so right, i hate they way i want to love you, and at the same time want to hate you. i hate the way you make me cry, and always make me wonder "why?". i hate the wya i really hate you. i hate all teh lies that make me cry, and all the times i waited for you, when you never did show.i hate all teh dreams that will never come true, but most of all, i hate the way i cant hate you.

      ok so today is clint and danielles 1 year! lol im really happy for him. whenever they get in a fight, hes always telling me how he wants everything to be ok, and that he really loves her. and i can so totally tell, without him telling me. its like the longest relationship hes ever had, and im not sure but  i think jenna was the closest to being with him the longest. but we all remember that story, and how after he told her the truth she broke up with him, and then asked him out the next day... yea buddy. but clitn and danielle really do sound perfect for eachother. i could prolly make it a definate, if i saw him or them more often. who knows, cathy- clints stepmom- took early retirement when they did all the continental layoffs, and she told me she still had her flight priveledges, so maybe they should coome back here sometime, it would be totally cool.

      ok so yea yesterday was chris's party. i couldnt not go because shes one of my best friends, but it was so weird because of the people that were there. they were cool, dont get me wrong, but only a few of them were people that i could see me actually having a conversation with. ok and then i went to the game and chilled with drew. spring run-ruled tomball 15-0 in 5 innings, then i came home and crashed. then today i went to church and saw everyone but mandi!- where were you!?!? so much for going to mrs.schillings together- anyways then we went to our sunday school teachers house . it was cool, its a huge house and its just her and her husband so it felt even bigger. they live in a country club, so that was cool. speaking of country clubs, i wish i could go see megan but shes like grounded for life now because of jason. so i tanned all day and swam and then when we all left, kate didnt know how to get to becky's house from there, so i told her to follow me, and then we were at some light, and some guy was checking me out in the left turn lane, bc i just threw on a spaghetti strap shirt over my bkini top and some shorts, and i rolled down my window and was like" um yea, no chance ... youre like 30- ew, o and by the way, your left turn light has been green for like ever" EW! and i looked in my mirror to make sure kate was still behind me and she was laughing her ass off. ok so then on the way home, becky started to give kate directions, and beckys house is on the way to mine, so we raced down 2920 and aldine westfield. fun stuff.

      ok so today was chris's party. it was really kinda awkward because i was the only person from spring and whenever someone would ask me what school i went to, i'd tell them and they'd be like "oh....thats cool" because we dont really like the woodlands and they dont really like us. so at 5, i left and went to the baseball game. me nad drew  had been calling eachother back and forth talking all day while i was at chris's house, so i told him i was coming to the second game, and to save me a seat. so i got there and he was standing at the top already there, so i went and stood by him. he said that chrystal was going to come, so i was kinda excited because we havent talked in a while. so she finally got there, and drew went to go meet her at her car, and when she either saw that i was there, or saw that she would have to climb through the stands she left.so drew went chasing after her, and i thought she was going to come back, but she didnt, when he came back i asked him if he was ok, and he said that she didnt want to watch the game anymore and was just going to meet him at his grandmas for his cousins birthday party later. he looked really sad. but yea, we got to hang out which was cool. hes exempting lightfoot's pre-cal honors exam which made me mad, because i cant exempt the trigonometry exam we're taking in lightfoot's class. o well, so tomorrow im going to church, then im going to mrs. schilling's house to hang out with our sunday school class, and then im coming home and studying for my exams i have next week.

      yea so yesterday was the last day the seniors had exams... it was pretty sad, especially since Gib and Becca were going to be gone... it'll be weird with out them. and then today in spanish, chuck's phone rang and mr.wilson flipped, and told chuck that if he didnt put it on silent he was going to pull out a pistol and shoot him lol.(he was joking) and then morgan was like " if you shoot chuck, the phone will still be ringing " and then mr. wilson was all like " well then we'll have to answer it and tell them that he cant talk right now! " lol it was so funny. and then chuck told us that it was trace that called lol.---> trace is a senior from our spanish class, that gets on mr.wilson's nerves, along with morgan, chuck, stefani, christa, and travis. it will be really weird finishing school without all of my senior friends :( i was walking with anna to 7th period and i told her how much emptier the halls were , and that i'd rather the freshmen leave and the seniors stay. jeez, we have way too many freshmen.....1006! craziness. o well, im going to graduation next week , o and i so scored! i got out of taking 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th period exams..! that means i get out 2 days early.

      haha idk why i thought about this but i just remembered about the football game i went to for clint. lol i remember it was in 8th grade and me and mandi were going to go cheer him on. earlier during school he told me about how he didnt play and there was no point in me going to the game, and i was like i have to go, bc its your last game and i havent gone to any all season. lol so im leaning up against the fence seperating the stands from the 5 foot drop to the track and i remember screaming " go clint! "  and then he went in the game as the qb. haha. but yea. if youre reading this clint... haha i still have that pick of you in the football team pic. lol i remember that day too. you forgot your socks or pants or something lol. good times good times. and dont forget! when you come back the first thing we're doing is playing that stupid game we made up, and then we're going  to megans, and then we're all going to the mall and stuff, and then we're going to the skate park thats kinda by her house! lol i really need more pics of you for my scrapbook.

      (*tune of jingle bells*)  Twinkle Toes, Houston Blows, I want to move awayyyy, Pack my bags and drive a car, and end up in SA.... hEY!     ok so thats my song i got from a sk8er guy here, in case you havent heard me sing it before. i cant wait to leave. so i was thinking about what happened yesterday with my dad, and then i remembered something he said... we... i mean HE was talking and telling me what i did wrong and crap and because apparently i was driving way too close to the car infront of me, even though i was going 45 and there was like room for 4 cars inbetween us on the freakin empty road. well anyways he goes "sara, sara, sara damnit! slow down!! we dont need you to end up totaling your car too. jeez, lets not be like mandi and ride too close." O MY COW!  how messed up is that?!?!!? my dad knows how messed up i was after mandi got in that wreck. i was so scared that she could have died, or that christa could have since she wasnt even wearing her seatbelt. and then he goes and says that about my oldest friend!!! but what really makes me mad is that mandis older sis, erin, totaled her firebird when she was 16, and since then my dad was like ," you cant look back at erins mistakes and assume that mandi will be the same, just because theyre sisters" ok so he's like a hypocrite now, and hes telling me that im going to end up in a wreck totaling my car like mandi. and we're not even RELATED! well, practically we could be but we're not! ugh maybe its not spring and houston, or texas all together i hate so much.... maybe its just the way my dad treats me. a while back i was talking to clint and i was crying about how much i hated my dad. i told clint my dad treated me like crap , and he got really  mad because he thought he had hit me or something. but i told him about everything that my dads done to be an ass since i was like 12, and thats when i realized that my dad and clint's dad arent that different in ways.

      ugh. my dad makes me so mad. he rode with me when i went to pick up my sister from her clinical,( since her car is messed up ) and apparently, driving since i was 12, taking drivers ed and then taking defensive driving ( at MY PARENT'S request ) isnt good enough, because its obviously wrong to make a turn crossing traffic at 15 mph through a 45 zone, it is neccesary to begin slowing down 100 feet before approaching an empty intersection with a red light, and you shouldnt go over 5 mph for the first 50 feet after leaving a stop sign. ---> how about not so that i dont get creamed by a jacked up  f250 4x4 driving behind me. ugh and then with my dad AND my sister in the car togehter feels like the epocolipse is going on, and all hell's broken loose. its totally like i said a while back. my dad treats me like the red-headed step child. and the whole way home all he did was criticize me. and ugh! UGH! now... this is the 2nd major time my happy level has gone way down. the first was that one day....( my best friends know what im talking about... *cough cough* clint and megan and chris. )UGH! just another time that i wish i could go live far away from texas, or even houston like clint. it sucked not having him here for my sweet 16th birthday.., not having him here for his bday or christmas, and it'll really suck not having a senior year with him, but oh well. when you play "kitty" and you get dealt crappy cards, you give in and move on to the next game. but sometimes i really do wish i could move away. i'd go to cali and live with my family in sacramento or wherever they live by the water and go surfing to relieve my stress and just chill with my friends, or i'd go to new mexico and snowboard all day with my family and friends there. or maybe id just move away with mandi and go on that super  long road trip we've always talked about. idk but i MAJORLY need to get out of this place!!!!!!!!!

      ugh my dad makes me so mad! ok so i was still tired this morning from the game last night, and he got mad at me bc i didnt feel like going to the lake. he was all like, i dont care, youre going... you got back from the game before  it was too late last night, and maybe if you had gone out with the seniors like you said you weer i would understand but you were asleep by midnight... ok so hes all bitching at me...LIKE HE ALWAYS DOES!- clint-> you know what im talking about- and i was like im not going. i have to do a 139 question biology honors review, a history review, spanish 3 review and an algebra 2 honors review before monday morning, im not going. and then he went on one of his power trips and was like why do you have to have it done by then. so i had to spell it out in lamens terms that my homeroom class was turning all of our school issued books in on monday. and then my mom wasl ike- i dont understand why do you have to turn them in monday. so i had to explain that, and then my dad was like- do you mean to tell me that your teachers gave you these reviews on thursday and friday and ezxpected you to do them all over the weekend?!?! and so then i had to explain to him that not every one of the 3 thousand something students in our school was turning their books in on monday that it was spread out through the week. ugh! so then he was like... FINE! u stay home but dont complain to me about being bored and not being able to do this and that.. ugh he acts like i dont have a car.anyways. ugh and me and clint have talked about this next part before. my dad totally treats me like the red-headed step child. if my younger brothers do something they shouldnt, they dont get in trouble and he acts like he doesnt even care. but if i do something that doesnt even come close to the severity of what they did, he goes and acts all mental. and then he yells at me, and makes me get mad and start yelling back and all this crap.  and he acts the same way between me and stephanie. ugh! i swear the only time hes ever decent  is when i have a game. or he wants to talk about softball. and then ugh 1 day i went to go watch the guys play the woodlands and i came home and was excited because it went into extra innnings and darrel got a walkoff homerun and i was trying to tell my dad aboutit and he was like- sara, i dont care. go tell your mom. OMG! CAN U SAY WHAT A BITCH!??!??! i can. and it goes on and on. sometimes i wish my parents would split so i could just be with my mom and only choose to see him when i wanted. but idk. lifes a bitch.

       ok so in the last 10 or whatever years they've had softball at our school, the varsity team has always gone to playoffs. And we never make it past the quarterfinals. Ok so  since we won district again, we got a bye for our first game. Then we played Belton, and beat them like 4-1 or something I don't remember, and then last night we played magnolia. Yea buddy. Their pitcher and our pitcher are like the best pitchers around. Like ours, megan gibson, got a full Scholarship to Texas a&m university at college station. And its worth over $80,000. So yea, shes pretty good, well we faced off magnolia last night, and in the 3rd inning they bunted to cilla and she threw the ball to 2nd to get the lead runner out. Well it was a bad throw and they ended up advancing to 3rd. And so there were 2 runners on and it sucked something happened and they scored. Then with another runner on 1st, amanda scarborough came up and hit one over the 210 fence off of megan- her 1st ever- and scored 2 runs. well long story short, we lost 4-0. It sucked major. coach wy called us out to left field so we could have our talk like usual and all she said was" i enjoyed coaching y'all, this is most definitely my best team ever." and she was crying the whole time. Then she left and that made everyone cry even harder, esp. the seniors. so everyone was crying even me and all of our fans just sat there and stood on the sidelines. and then coach meade was like "ok, lions on 3... 1..2..3.." and we said lions but you could tell we were all crying.when we left towards the dugout to get our stuff, everyone was clapping and that made me cry even more. and its not like i like to cry so yea... like when kirby died, i told myself i wouldnt die... and then when the rest of the team around me was crying and i saw drew's lil bro mitch cry, i just burst. it was so sad.  and now last night i was like , crying will make it worse, dont cry. and when i saw becca, megan, jackie and everyone else crying i had nothing to do but cry. while we were waiting to load up in the vans, me and mandi saw coach wy just sitting off in the distance crying. it hurt so bad. we all wanted it bad. and to bring up the mood me and mandi were talking about how we always take a bus to quarterfinals and we lose so we took vans like the ones we had in arizona, and we lost, so next year we're taking charter buses like we do for the 2nd playoff games. ok well sob story over for now... im gonna go eat some cinnamon toast crunch or trix, i havent decided yet....  l8er peoples

      yea so today was ok i guess. i woke up, let sadie out, and made plans to go pick up mandi and go to the baseball game so we could hangout and just chill after what happened yesterday. ok so im getting ready and then my dad just happened to nag me about getting a job again. and he presses it so hard, omm! mainly because stephanie = my sis thats 21, doesnt do anything but drain my parents bank account. she hasnt had a job for like a year, shes in college, doesnt pay her insurance, cell phone bills, doensnt pay for clothes,  NOTHING! ok shes 21 and still living at home .. what does that tell ya?!?!? EXACTLY! it sucks major. because she never really HAD to have a job until her senior year bc she didnt get her license until she was already 17. my bad, im sorry i had to be the middle child, im sorry i had to have an older sibling to ruin it for me, im sorry i had to be the child that wanted to be ahead and life and start drivign before her. ugh and i swear she hates me. my aunt told me that steph never liked me  since i was a baby. and my mom even said steph stopped liking me the day she realized i wasnt going anywhere after i was born.  thanks for letting me know right?!?! how about not. so ugh my dad went and made me cry and storm out, then my mom came in my room and gave me this long speech how i was over exaggerating and crap and ugh. it made me so mad. i cant wait to get out of here. screw texas, im leaving... as soon as i graduate. my mom was like, sara, we told your sister we would pay for her tuition and that she would be on her own otherwise. if i had known id be paying her insurance and bills for 4 years, it wouldnt have happened. and then ugh ... so yea there steph goes again. why do they have to hold me,.... sara, the 16 year old daughter, to as high of a level as steph- a 21 year old daughter. its not fair at all that they do this all the time. and todays not the only time. my dad has to throw it in all the time. like the night of a game after we get back and i did good, and im excited and he just has to spend a minute yelling at me and nagging to go and ruin it. and thats atleast 2 times a week. but im going to my aunts tomorrow for mothers day, so im sure i'll hear about it plenty.

      after i realized how lucky i was that mandi was ok, it made me think about drew's accident, back in december on the way to the memorial service for ryan kirby. i had just seen drew, given him a hug, and told him id see him later at school, and that i wasnt going to the burial. he ended up getting in a wreck, and totalling his truck. i guess the reason i didnt see how bad it really was was bc i wasnt there. i didnt see the truck. i just talked to him on the phone, at school, and at church about it. i was actually there, standing 3 feet away from mandis car. but now i see just how lucky i am that i didnt lose drew or mandi

      ok wow. today was totally weird. we were leaving school, going on the feeder, and i saw a bunch of wreckers and 2 girls, a teacher, and another person. as i got closer, i realized " wow, i cant believe this. its mandi's car. " so i pulled over and ran over to her and wanted to cry so bad. she was standing stiff like she was frozen. omc. apparently, a car 2 cars in front of her slammed on their breaks b4 turning onto louetta, and the car infront of her slammed, and then they left her with out any time to stop. so she slammed on her breaks and it was too late.the hood is  oractically cracked in half, bent back  at the end of the engine block. the wrecker said it was probably unfixable, and then that he was pretty sure it was totaled. omc and christa was riding with mandi too. the airbags went off. thank God. mandis got a few burns from the air bag stuff and a mark from her seatbelt., and christas got more. she normally does, but she didnt wear her seatbelt. but thankfully everythings ok.  it was so scary. when i got home, i called chris, and just started crying bc i was so scared. i kept thinking... what if? what if the air bags hadnt gone off? what if she was going faster? what if she hadnt had her seatbelt on? all i could think about was how close i came to losing one of my closest friends, the one that ive known the longest, knows me so well, lives a few streets away, is my throwing partner for softball, all around. how close i was to not having her anymore.

      ok so yesterday was Kim's baby shower, she lives down the street, and used to baby-sit me all the time and i was always friends with her lil sis Laura, and i had a class with Travis. well i wanted to go, but i promised meg and christine we could hang out since meg's parents were letting her drive with me and all now. so my mom went with mandis mom. well anyways, i totally missed out on the gossip lol even though that sounds really wrong. this morning my mom came in my room and told me that sarah schroeder is pregnant too, and so is renee peoples, and then that our old volleyball coach from dueitt- ms. baumgartener well anyways, her daughter lindsay is steph's age- 21- and ms.b ended up picking up lindsay from a party bc she was drunk and didnt want to drive home drunk, and ended up getting in a car after she got home and driving somewhere while she was drunk, and got in an accident. she rammed into a car and killed the man in it, and his wife is in critical condition at some hospital so yeaso she'll prolly get charged with manslaughter andthats really bad. plus she was going to college on a volleyball scholarship or something. but yeah. then my mom said that mrs. gloria- kim, travis and lauras mom, said that travis got in a wreck sometime super early saturday morning like around 1 or 2 or something, but hes ok, so thats good. and GOOD NEWS!!! hmm. let me think of some first haha...well... i found out that Matt Morrison really liked me alot and i turned him down because i met somebody that changed me instantly and prolly has no clue how i feel about them, but that might change in a while ... megan has some big "plan" lol. i dont know if i should worry or not

      yea so lets see... hmm. my mom flipped on me last night because i didnt finish taking the stupid antibiotics that gay doctor gave me. then my mom went all skippy and went off telling me that this is why people die from bacteria infections, this is how people come immune to the antibiotics. jeez, ok i took honors biology this last year, i couldnt sleep in the class because it was 1st period, i watched all the videos, took all the notes, passed my tests and quizzes, and definately passed the class by a mile. does she really think i wasnt paying attention!?!?!?! i know about the meds, and what happens. i know the procedures i know what goes on, i've seen osmosis jones lol, then she went and goes "i hope you dont get sick" like she really cared. oh well, time to move on. and im still pissed about what she said about me needing to move on. yea whatever, theres nothing for me to move on from. and she acts like she knows everything that me and him have told eachother. maybe if she knew she'd be saying different things to me like..." im so sorry sara for all the things i've said about it. i didnt realize what was going on, i didnt know he said that, and did that, i didnt realize how hard it was for you to deal with it, im sorry for nagging you about him constantly." yea thats in my dreams right..

      ok so far summers been great. well, except for megan being grounded for like ever, and just recently getting phone priveledges and her parents letting her go places with me. she said her mom thinks im a really good influence on her or something. but im not complaining. then christine got majorly busted, but not as bad as it could have been. so shes been on the worst restriction ever. they took her cell, only let her talk to people once each time a day, and for 10 minutes! now thats majorly gay right?!?!?  lets see, then i met this totally cool guy that goes to klein, and hes everything ive known to like in a guy, but then something else happened. i met this OTHER guy and realized that everything i liked in the first guy was crap, and i just liked him because of something that had happened before i met him. so this new guy totally opened me up to see what i really wanted and that it was him! lol so he called me the other day to tell me that he was going to the mall, and wanted to see if i was going to be there. and what sucked was that i had just gotten back from the mall with christine and me and my mom were at her new house when he called. so i couldnt even talk long. but whats weird is that i havent felt this way since the first time me and clayton talked that one night when we talked from like 10pm until 5am, without a moment of silence. but needless to say, my mom managed a way to make me feel like shit. asking about the guy from klein and if he was a potential boyfriend, and when i told her no, she asked why, and i told her because i didnt really like him. and then she just had to go and put me down, telling me that i had to move on, away from someone in my past, who she needs to understand that i was never UNDER HIM!, so theres NO WAY i can get OVER HIM!

      yea ..  me and mandi definately need to get soem road trips in soon. since like 7th or 8th grade we've been planning our trip to cali and i dont think nos padres will let us go until we graduate lol. but that still leaves college station, south padre, austin, wimberley, galveston, and tons of other places. and then in '06 whoop whoop we'll hit cali again. that was so much fun- the softball trip. we flew out to vegas, rented our cars, and then had to drive over to arizona but it was super dark, and me, christine, jill, and mandi fell asleep while mr carey and mr mike drove - leading the other cars- and then all of a sudden im like half asleep and i heard mr mike say "pat, ive been looking at the map, and im pretty sure we're not in arizona or nevada.... i think we're in cali." so that woke me up and i reached over and woke mandi up and she was like " so we're in cali... are we by where clint lives?" and i was like "well we've been driving for like ever, and if we're by where he lives we're screwed. because that s on the OTHER side of cali." so we turned around and got back to where we were supposed to be. that was one ofthe best parts. except for our last day when we went to hoover dam, and chelsea was wearing laurens zebra cowboy hat and it flew off and landed somewhere in the  water and she just stood there hanging over the rail for liek ever saying " wheres the hat? wheres the hat? omg its gone!" that was hilarious.  and then later we were back in vegas and we got doen eating at hard rock nad went to find our cars that the dads and the guys took over to soem german steak place, and we found them and were waiting in the parking lot  and meg and becca nadmo and amy were walking over to this bar that we found out was a gay bar, and started singing " we're going to a gay bar" over and over and right when they gotto the doors 2 couples came out and they all ran screaming back to the cars! it was so funny then coach wy locked them out of her car, and amy was like "why dont you love us anymore?!!? " and it prolly didnt help that when we were leaving hard rock walking, everyone picked up the hooker ads and porno mags out of the magazine racks and started flipping through the guys and making fun of some "things". lol but yea good times. then we left and drove down the strip one last time andamy jumped out of the car at an intersection to take a pick of the m&ms place . great idea right. haha so then we went to the airport and some chinese guy cut me in line and mr renfro- beccas dad went bazirk and went up to him and was yelling at him and telling him to go back to the end of the line. it was cool what sucked was that by the time we got to our gate it was like 11 nad everything was closed and me and amers were thirsty and couldnt find any water or anything so we went and watched some old people play the slots by the gate, and we all played cards on the floor bc our flight wasnt for like atleast and hour and when we got back home in houston my dad was waiting for us in baggage claim and it was already light outside. our flight landed at like 6 something.  but it was the best time ever. too many memories.. the gay bar, cali, getting lost, the hotel, kitty, losing money haha except for mandi lol, cilla not being able to stop crapping, megan waking up and screaming and me and mandi being next door, beating all the cali teams, and only losing 1 game, all 3 teams from texas that were invited getting in the top 10-> elkins taking 1st, south lake carrol taking 3rd and us taking 9th. the stupid bandage mr mike put on my leg that changed the color of my knee, and stayed that color for months, all the dinners and that one lunch at that place with the ppl that had off campus lunch- ugh, EVERYTHING! but the best part had to be morgan's lil bro kyle running up to some cali team saying we heard them dissing us and staring crap. that was funny. but i def wont forget when that one girl from south lake carrol dove into home and landed wrong. that was super scary. we were watching and cheering them on, and it happened and we all freaked bc megan and their pitcher were friends on the same select team. the girl coudlnt move and they had to call an ambulance it was so scary omm. but she ended up being ok so that was good. but all in all spring high softball + 4 vans + las vegas + hoover dam + and the tournament of champions national invitational softball tournament- ramada express = our principal regretting letting us go. haha jk jk the best spring break ever!

           my mom said she talked to mr.rick- clints dad and asked him when he was coming back and he said clint had summer school or something which sucks major.  he totally needs to come back soon! i found his christmas present in my closet and you could tell it was from christmas lol so yea, and i think hes pretty much long overdue for coming back to spring. since hes been gone, me, mandi, chris, have all turned 16, drew turned 17, we all started driving legally, steph had surgery, sadies grown a bunch and clints still the only person she doesnt bark at when they walk in the house, softball season has come and gone, its almost been a year. that totally sucks. i so miss the once a month visits he used to have. i still even have the letter he gave me when he left for good the first time. i remember i cried...shhh... and he came back every month like he promised until like march or something. anyways. my best friend needs to come back lol and if he thinks im the only one that misses him hes totally wrong. i know for a fact that his family here misses him. esp christina and tiff. me, baylin, megan, helen, kipp, jacob, fernando, nathan, and im pretty sure theres more people im forgetting.

      ok where to start, hmmm... my neck hurts like a mother trucker's dead dogs mom, my head feels like its going to pop and explode quicker than mandi's tire on the mustang when some bitch slashed it, my throat is like red, hurting major, swolen, and dry, and to top it all off, the stupid doctor said all that was wrong was that i had allergies, and some virus thats going around. ok wow, lets see, i've had allergies how long? lol for like ever!, hmm...  it didnt take a genius to figure out it was a virus, i mean come on... flu seasons over, ive already had it ugh, its not cold, its freakin hot outside, so im pretty sure it could only be meningitis, west nile, or a virus. come on now. i can move my neck -to a degree- , so meningitis is out, even though its been raining,  i havent seen a mosquito, so  im pretty much sure i dont have west nile, so yea buddy, sara has a virus, im taking way too many meds -tylenol, motrin, benadryl, sudafed, alegra d, amoxocilin, im sure theres more. and the freakin amoxocilin pill is like an inch big- whoa nelly, and looks like a horse freakin pill, thats like 875 mg or something, so i have to cut it in half in order to swallow it. i cant drive while im sick, so no going to megans, chris's or anywhere i want, all day i can either go outside and lay in the sun, watch tv, talk on the phone, computer, or sleep. so thats peachy. and to top it off, the baseball game on friday is in round rock adn i dont think my dad will want to drive me, and hopefully i'll be able to go on saturday to the championship game when spring baseball gets 1st place in state playoffs. kk, well im going to go talk to my peoples...

      ok so i think things are better with me and mis padres now... last night our family.. well steph didnt go as usual... well anyways we went to the lake  and chilled. and my dad let me drive the boat.. the boat is brand new, and we've only taken it on the lake like 4 or 5 times and maybe 3 times to galveston. ok so my dad goes "sara, do you want to drive?" whoa nelly, yea i totally didnt see that coming. but it was good. i almost didnt even go because of what happened the other day, but i guess im glad i did. but what sucks is that i dont think im going to get to go to java jazz tonight. o well, i'll go next week. and i think we're going boating and tubing and stuff again tuesday and saturday next week so yea. we'll see if this holds up. OH YEA! ok so the guys at school are still in state playoffs for basball. its great. baseball hasnt gotten that far since like 1977 or something. softball is like the only team that usually is in playoffs. but this week theyre playing at texas a&m university on teh baseball field there. last night they played rockwall and won 8-0 and then tomorrow at 2pm they play them again in the series. YEA BUDDY!

      ok so earlier today i posted things about COW COUNTRY and i didnt really get to finish becausei was in a rush to go work out with soem friends. alright so yea i just cant do it. i cant be that far in the middle of nowhere. i swear, when me and mandi and drew went on the world changers trip to dallas i thought i was going to die. it was only a 3-4 hour drive, but HOUSTON to DALLAS is completely nothing but COW FREAKING COUNTRY! when we finally drove up about to go through downtown dallas, my heart totally jumped when i saw the buildings. i was so excited to see civiliation. im a city girl, a beach girl, a rodeo girl, but NOT a COW COUNTRY GIRL! going on road trips through arizona, nevada, and california--- i can totally do and love, but i dont think i could live in cow country for longer than a week or two. speaking of road trips, me and mandi are still taking that one to california senior year, and im thinking that we need to go back to college station sometime soon, WITHOUT our moms, because tons of super hot guys and a lot of people thought we went to Texas A&M University, and didnt think we were sophomores in high school. but what was really weird, is that once they found out we were still in high school, they asked where, and we told them Spring High and a lot of them had gone there too. so that was cool. and i think im going to Java Jazz on friday. me and matt have been talking and i think thats what we're going to do, because i cant get out of the house  until 2:30 or maybe 3 every day because i have to watch my bros while the parentals are at work, and he has football practice after that. so yea its kinda confusing i guess. but its good, and theres open bar while the bands are playing from 7-11pm so im definately overdue for a Cookie Monster, its totally been to long since i had one.

      yea buddy. ok so i dont know whats going on with jared. and part of me really doesnt want to know. this weekend was great even though me and clint didnt get to talk as much as we usually do but its all apples! lol anyways... things are different now.i was thinking about how clint moved to be with his mom in cali, and chris moved to the woodlands , and megan moved to magnolia, and it all really sucks ass. if mandi or drew moves im going to have to do something about it because im running out of people that i can talk to whenever i want about stuff. so yea buddy. then i started thinking about my great aunt- (clint-> the one with the cows ->) and how much shes been in the hospital lately and all, and i heard my dad talking to my mom and if she dies, we will get all of her land and assets along with my aunt sharon splitting it up. well anyway. my aunt sharon and uncle tom are always traveling because she works for anadarko nad he is a photographer, so theres no way they'd take all the land. and my dad has always wanted to move up there because when he was a kid he spent his summers there. ok so my dad really likes it there. and its nice i guess, if we took some 4 wheelers up there and a jeep it would be more fun, but its nice, but hello! the down point- 1. its COW COUNTRY  2. its  COW COUNTRY and 3. its COW COUNTRY! ok to go to the mall, you have to drive to bryan or college station. how about not! thats like over an hour drive to the closest freaking mall. ok lets see, here, in  SPRING, TEXAS---> i can choose from 3 full sized malls  with me having to drive 10 minutes to deerbrook, 20 min to the woodlands, and maybe 30-40 minutes to willowbrook depending on how much traffic there is. im pretty sure i would die if i spent more than a week in  cow country. the only good thing would be COW TIPPING --- which i promise clint, i'll take you up there and let you do it haha

      ok so yeah. weird things lately..hmm... well me and megan have been hanging out with holden, jeremy, nathan, and brian. and its been really fun and all. then this morning CLAYTON im's me out of nowhere. ok claytons the guy that i had a phone convo with that was like from 9 pm to 5 am and there wasnt a moment of silence the entire time! i remember it lol perfectly. well he tells me that he loves me, and that he wants me to go out with him and how he wants to be with me and im just like.... what are you on??? lol and we talked and he said that he thought about it and seeing my picture again made him realize that what he wanted was ME of all people. and i was like, clayton, youre just a horndog you dont really want me. and then of course he was like... yes sara, i do. so we went down that road again, and then some how it led me saying "i guess" to something and him going " sara, it ahs to be yes or no, not i guess" so i said "fine then, its no." and he got all mad and i was like stop being a titty baby and get over it. you just want me because youre a freakin horndog. and yea. i dont really know whats going on, but i do know that clayton is not the person i want right now, but im still not sure who i do want. o well. clint  should  be coming back soon for the weekend or something and i'll have him to talk to about everything.

      omg. i was talking on the phone with meg and she said brb theres someone on the other line.... so she coems back and says "sara, chance died, i've got to go". so i called christine and told her, and she didnt really know him as much as i did, and she was like, "call me back when you have the details." so then megan calls me back. (now you have to know the story. megan liked chance, a lot.&nbsp; and when we were out with holden, nathan, and jeremy on friday night, meg called brandi to check up on her, and brandi told her than chance told her that he liked megan a lot too. so everything seems perfect right?!?!?!? exactly.) so megan cals me back this morning and tells me that chance was swimming in the woodlands saturday night and he just got tired and drowned. i didnt know what to say, and i still dont. i've never had a friend of mine die. the closest i've come to it, was when jessica kirby's little brother ryan died. and that was horrible. i remember leaving school to go to the funeral service at our church, the whole sanctuary was packed and its a pretty big sanctuary. i remember the whole varsity softball team sitting together crying when they played his favorite song, and drew's little brother mitch- one of ryan's best friends- just breaking down and balling a few rows infront of me. it was horrible. and i didnt even know chance that well, i had only heard about him. but i hate that megan is going through this. and now, thinking about it, im still shaken. i hate funerals, i've gone to so many, and i just hate them. i always tell myself that im not going to cry, that im going to hold it in, but&nbsp; at lil kirby's funeral, i just couldnt do it, it was so horrible, he was only 12. i just wish everything could be better for megan...

      ok, so i really am sorry for everything that has happened; Brian, Jared getting the wrong idea, and the whole Matt thing.&nbsp; but when i look at it, i see the glass as being half full. i mean, if everything hadnt happened the way it did,&nbsp; then i dont think that ai'd be where i am. like, now i see things so much more clearly, and i know what i want. but anyways, i've moved on and am really sorry. but when you cry a river, you have to build a bridge to get over it. well... i'm already tearing the bridge down. so dont ever frown, because you never know when someone's falling in love with your smile!

      ok so where to start... i went to pick up megan yesterday around 3:40 -ish and then we went in to the woodlands to go see what time our movie was playing that night. ok so i miss the turn, and pull a u turn on timberloch and right when i got into the furthest lane over, my battery dies! ok so i call my dad and he says hes on his way, and then me and meg called holden to tell him we'd be late to see him if we even got to go. well then as me and megan lay in my car for like an hour and a half, holden is on the phone and tells me that some guy is going to come up in a black van and ask us if we need help. then kidnap us, kill us, and have sex with our corpses. yea so i was like .. thanks holden.. alot. THEN right after that, this f250 extended cab pulls up behind me and meg says that the guy is coming over to my window. so me being freaked out, he asks if my car broke down. you have no idea how much i wanted to say." no mr., we just thought it would be nice to sit in my hot&nbsp;car on the side of the road for an hourwhile its over 96 degrees outside.... THERES YOUR SIGN!" so i tell him my dads on his way and he leaves. then my dad takes me and meg to get a new battery and then my padres tell us we can go on with our&nbsp; plans just to be home by 10:30. so we go on, call holden and christine to tell them we're ok after all and me and meg decide to go to barnes and noble to get coffee. well we finally leave and go to taco bell where holden tells us that hes in the woodlands too at a park sk8ing. so christine meets us at taco bell and leads us to the park bc i would so get lost trying to find it. we got there and holden and nathan were waiting by his car. we didnt stay there long, but it was fun while we were there. then we left and went to meet jeremy at bear branch park, so we followed holden there. and right when we got there some psycho cop over reacted to jeremy and almost arrested but the cop new holdens dad so he let him go. so yea, that was pretty "exciting" me meg and christine sitting on the curb by the cars while the cop tells nathan to get in holdens car, and tells the other cop to check out jeremy and nathan. but anyways, then christine left because it was almost her curfew. so me meg holden nathan and jeremy went to burger king off of research forest and chilled there for a while. then i called my house to tell my padres that i was about to come home and they were gone and my bros were there. nathan thought i was at a bar so i gave the phone to holden so hed believe i wasnt, and holdens like "yea man, we're at a bar gettin drunk".&nbsp; then i called my dads cell and told him i was about to leave and he was like... be careful hunny lol. so we told everone "bye" and then headed to my car. holden asked me if i knew how to get to the freeway from where we were and i was like... uh i think so lol, so he told me and then megan ended up calling him asking him if we went the right way or not, even though i told her i knew where we were so yea. so normally it takes me 15 min just to get to the freeway from my house, and 20-25 min to get to the woodlands from my house. well not last night lol. me and meg were pretty hyper so the stereo was up and we were goin for a while and we ended up spending less than 5 min on the freeway, getting from the back of the woodlands to my house in only 15 min! so yea. definately a friday me and megan will NEVER forget lol.

      yea so earlier i really started feeling shitty for what happened with me and Matt. everything was great, almost perfect and then i had to go and meet SOMEONE else and that guy totally changed my outlook. i totally lost what i felt for Matt and couldnt bear to break his heart. what really hurts me more is that i broke his heart, for someone who prolly doesnt even see me the way i see them. COUGH COUGH "SOMEONE".  so yea, i wish clint was here to make me laugh or something

      yeah buddy. so todays wednesday.. thats cool. im supposed to go work out with mandi tomorrow after volleyball practice and conditioning. yea, and jackie told my mom that she wanted me to go to the 9-11 session in the weight room at school and work out with her. so i'll prolly do that a lot this summer. im really gonna miss her a lot. after i quit the avengers tournament team the summer before freshman year, she was the one that got me to try out for her tournament team and take christie's old spot. so yea, and shes totally cool and one of the greatest friends ive had in a while and she really is the sister i never had. because stephanie doesnt even really seem like a sister anymore. but yea. needless to say, im gonna miss her sooo much when shes at college next year and im definately going to be driving up to Tyler to hang out with her and watch her softball games there. i got the pics developed from the softball banquet and theres a really good one of me and her so of course its on my wall.

      hmm. today i went over to chris's house, and we chilled outside for a while laying in the sun in the backyard and talking about the good 'ol days when we still went to the same school. so of course we had to talk about how nick, kris, and budd thought she was pregnant in 8th grade when she was craving pancakes at lunch. and when me, meg, chris, and mandi went to the sock hop at jenkins together and then went to fuddruckers ms. jan afterwards and christines mom started talking trash about cheerleaders and we were like " um.. mandis a cheerleader" and i was just like , i guess its a good thing i didnt try out after i did all the practicing with mandi after all lol. but yea. i miss those days. but i guess one of the days i cant forget was when me and clint left baylin skating and went on a "holly jolly walk" as he  calls it, and went back into the woods nad ran across the golf course, that was freakin funny lol and i guess now i need to think about a recent funny lol. last weekened me and mandi were up in wimberley at the deer lease and we thought it was cool of all the people to wave at you when you let the cut in front of you on the road, so on the way back from the store, we decided to wave at all the nice country people, and NO ONE WAVED BACK! talk about rude lol. so we decided that we werent pulling into the lease in the truck until someone waved back at us. well.. unless a horse or a deer or maybe a stupid mosquito waved, NO ONE WAVED! so yea... we lost a lil happiness on the happy meter for a while. that is until we jumped in the creek and got in a "STONE THROWING" fight with my lil bros. yea i know, not smart right? well we were the ones running from the stones!

      ok so yea. whats new?. hmm... well me and Clint got in a fight, thought we werent friends anymore, but now its all better (or getting there anyhow) um my sister Steph still hates me, so thats not really new. and you cant say "oh, she doesnt hate you, youre over exaggerating", because i have proof. whenever Steph denies hating me or blames something on me, my aunt Mickie will go " Stephanie Michelle, you know youve hated her since the day she was born, just because you want to act like a spoiled little brat." or my mom will jump in and say "Stephanie, youve hated Sara since the day you realized we werent taking her back to the hospital". so yea, none of that bologna. anyways. hm.. my family and Mandi's family went to Wimberley this past weekend. it was fun i guess. we didnt really feel like riding the four wheelers much, or anything, i guess you kinda grow out of it. but the creek behind the cabin and trailer at the deer lease was flowing over the spillroad, so me and mandi put on our bikinis and went in the creek for a while just looking at stuff. it was weird, the last time the creek had that much water while we were there i cut my foot on a rock with algae all over it so it sucked, but i didnt this time thank God. but there were FISH in the creek, not just tadpoles or minnows, there were FISH  that were inches long in it. so yea. then my dad and Nathan were walking over the spillway (idk why) and the current from the water flowing over it swept them off there feet and Nathan landed on his butt in the road, and my dad slid down the slant  that goes into the creek. it was pretty funny. mainly bc after me and Mandi went to the store, we found a paper plate that Nathan drew on, and it was a pic of him lying on the road and my dad falling in the creek, it was pretty good for an 8 year old, i have to admit haha. now hmm... what else is new in the world of Sara?!?!?!? oh, everytime i spend too much time with my brothers, of course im going to get agrivated with one of them.. well ive decided that spending unnecessary amounts of time with my dad is JUST ASKING FOR TROUBLE. its like hes just asking for it when i "get an attitude" or "smart off". and i'll admit that i do it, but its kinda hard not to. ive told Clint how my dad acts to me and how he treats me different than my brothers (of course i think its because they are boys) and then he treats me different than Steph (because they both think im a bitch, and obviously dont mind telling me) but yea. well im freezing cold, so im going to climb into my nice cozy bed with a huge comphy blanket and stuff, so yea... l8er

      megans coming over tomorrow, and im pretty sure jacobs gonna try and ruin megans and my weekend. hes always calling her when he knows im there, and its really annoying, and he acts like shes her property WHICH SHE ISNT!!! and wants to know where she is, where shes going, why, with who. ugh then he always talks crap about me and clint, while im there next to her. and it made me so mad once i took the phone and told him off. i know me and clint arent on "GOOD TERMS" and i doubt we'll ever make up, but he was my friend, and it makes me so mad when ppl talk about him like that when they know im right there. UGH but anyways, megans coming over tomorrow for the weekend and thats all i care about!

      yea so here i am, being the smart person i always am. i started thinking about school, homecoming, and everything, and then i remembered about the tan lines from my bikini, so i totally dont do the whole fake-bake thing so i was like... hmm its 93o am... pretty sunny outside, so i decide to go outside, lay in my back yard, and get rid of those lines right?!?! ok so i see these 2 bottles on my desk that this coach gave our whole team last year and it was tanning stuff. so theres this before and after sprays and i put on the before spray, and im like ok, then i go in the backyard and lay in the sun for a while, but sadie (my dog) was out there too, and she started barking at the neighbor's dogs so i went inside. so im in my room, and i look down at my chest in the mirror, and i was like " holy shit! thats redder than a tomato!" lol and im like.... somehow i remember now why i havent used this stuff in a literal FOREVER! so yea. im hoping im not allergic to that crap bc that would totally suck, and the redness BETTER go away or im going to be majorly upset. now i have to deal with the burning lol. way to go sara!

      yea so the mood for now is "depressed" i guess. anywho... me and meg dont really get to talk much anymore. which i knew would happen eventually with her moving to magnolia and all. i was reminded of the new fish coming to softball next year and most of them are annoying of course but i'll be stuck with them anyway. apparently my mom thinks i need to see a shrink, which would be a waste of money bc all i would say is "i dont know whats wrong. leave me alone" or id go on about how much my family aggrivates me. the only person ive ever felt talking to about whats really going on is clint, and he prolly wont be coming back anytime soon. which sucks bc id prolly give anything about now just for him to come back for the day. that would make me feel a lot better for sure. and theres so much for both of us to tell eachother but ya know how that goes when two friends dont live in the same place anymore. one in texASS and in cali. so yea lifes pretty peachy. iv been trying to find a pic of me and mandi from when we were lik 11 at her grandmas house. we went through that whole tube socks, astros hat, phase and i know ive seen that pic of us in our worn out astros hats we wore everywhere somewhere. o well, i'll look for it later.

      yea so.. lol. i just felt like adding another post . well. my brothers pregnant cat is not so pregnant anymore, so if you want a kitten tell me because theres no way in hell we're keeping them, theres 3 all black, 1 black and white, and 1 grey and white. hm.. what else happened? lol for  some reason, i was looking at my calendar yesterday and looking at all of my friends birthdays and stuff. and then i saw daniel zometa's birthday on it. i was like... man i havent seen that kid in forever. and then i couldnt remember how i got his bday bc we only had math and english together for1st semester and we werent all buddy buddy. but damn he was hot lol. hmm... what else is new?i had the weirdest dream last night. instead of going out with chris, i went to java jazz for a while and saw holdens "band" play lol. and it was pretty weird bc i was sitting on like boxes by the other bands where they were waiting to go on, and then brendan was standing infront of me just staring at me lol. so we talked and then he went somewhere and i saw meg with ashley which was so uncool, bc she was back in spring AT JAVA JAZZ and she didnt even tell me. so that pissed me off, and then i kept watching holdens band play and some guy from his band wasnt playing for some odd reason and he was sitting with me on the boxes telling me about all these things holden does to be funny, and just trying to get me more into him. then afterwards i went to denneys with the band, and thats always fun so that was good. yeah so i dont really remember the rest of the dream.. i think thats where it cut off, but it was kinda weird because like i didnt really talk to holden yesterday so i wasnt thinking about him or anything when i went to bed, and as far as i know hes not in a band, and he hasnt even gone back to java jazz since he got in that one fight forever ago. hmm.. what else is there??? OMG kimberly is so pregnant right? well she gained 4 lbs like a week ago and the doctors going to induce if she doesnt have it this week!! i am so excited lol thats about it for now. haha im looking through my window and sadies rolling around in the grass playing in the sun. its sooo cute lol.
