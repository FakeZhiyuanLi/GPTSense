      Hey Levi thanks for helping me figure this whole thing out, mad props bud!   This is how I feel You don't know me, so dont talk about me! I know what happened, I was there and you weren't! He is saying that I keep calling and bugging him, but I'm not. You didn't here the things that he said to me and you don't know the way he made me feel. He was my good friend, He could tell me anything, problems with his girlfriend or school, I could also tell him anything, I thought that I could trust him. I was wrong. He told you lies so that way he could be cool and I would be a fool. So this is how I feel. Right now I'm not thinking about what we could have had, Because you are not worth it. Why would I want someone who tells lies? Why would I want someone that can't respect me? You might ask why I am saying all of this if I think your not worth it, But the truth is I don't know either,  I guess that's just how I feel! -Chelsea

      Church was so much fun last night especially when we had the banana and orange eating contest.  You might be asking why it was so much fun, well the reason why is because you could only use one hand to eat both of them and I beat 4 other people!   Levi, Jessi, Joni, AJ, and everyone else knows how fun that was.  After church I went to one of bestest friends house, we ended up staying up until like 5 in the morning!  We ate Burger King for dinner and had Taco Bell at like 2am.  When we got to the window at Taco Bell we could not stop laughing, I wonder if the guy thought we were high (Levi knows what I'm like at 2am lol).  That's about all that we did.   Hey Sarah!  It was so good to see you at church, since I haven't seen you your graduation party.  Next time that I talk to you I will tell you who the peom is about.   Sorry that I don't have any more wonderful writings for you, Sarah and Levi, but I will try and write something later, so that way you will really know how I feel!  Love ya! ~Chel'C
