                            All about Da Mini     When was the last time anyone out there saw a flesh and blood miniskirt? I am among those unfortunate souls who can't recall when they last had darshans of Da Mini. I even went to Paris and London looking for this elusive creature as, I was brought to believe by that favourite channel of all guys, FTV that these to cities  were the equivalent of Mecca and Medina for the followers of Da Mini.But   I was forced to come to terms with reality, the creature I had come halfway around the world to see had eluded me yet again and all I could say was 'Fuck you Mr Michel Adam for getting my hopes up'(now you know why BK is so anti-frenchie)     I am all to often told by those more clued in on fashion (ie Vidz) that as far a clothes go I know fuckall, well all I know is all of  todays fashion gurus are women with not nice legs or gay faggots who are more interested in kilts. Why else would anyone in their right mind say the mini isn't cool?    Its a cruel cruel world, how can a sane person do away with this   urlLink    (Hope the link is showing)and replace it with a pair of jeans that doesn't even allow one to admire the scenery? I mean whatever happened to the adage 'Less is more'.   Now you know why we cristened our blog fucked up fashion. Till more pure minded souls like me decide to do something to unfuck it, I guess shall have to make do with Da Mini I see everyday even though its not quite as good as the one that has been removed from my life.

       Its all in the Jeans   Recently, the two of us were taken Jeans shopping by Vidz. This, along with past discoveries, lead us to the conclusion that even jeans have gone mad with fashion.  See, there used to be a time where jeans were simple. They basically came in two shades of blue, and one style. It was this simplicity that lead to their popularity, and acceptance, and their status as a youth symbol. But no. Today's fashion has to go and destroy that.  Here's what happened. You simply can't go and buy jeans anymore. They now come in 500 different colours and shades, most of which are actually not blue.  So you've chosen the color, good for you. You think its over? Far from it. Now you have to choose design. There's tight, baggy, low cut (The type that leaves your ass hanging out, but thats another topic for another day).  Done that? No here comes the real killer. You might want to have your jeans PRE-FADED! Good lord! Why? Faded jeans take a lot of work. They're a symbol of your love for the jeans, and your refusal to wear much else. Some of these jeans today even come pre-torn! Its a generation of wannabes, I tell you. The worst are the ones with these patches of fade, running down the front and back of thigh. One wonders what the wearer was heavily rubbing against to get such a fast fading on these particular areas.   So get back to the basics. Buy a pair of blue jeans, unfaded, not baggy, not tight, just normal, blue jeans. Return to some of the purer things this life has to offer.   Next issue, PC offers his views on the dissapearance of Da Mini.

       Body Piercings   I don't understand body piercings. Lets get this in perspective. To get a piercing, you must voluntarily allow someone to shove a large needle through your skin, scald it so that it doesn't ever heal back, and leave a permanent hole through you(note, THROUGH you, not even leading into you, as if you don't have enough of your own). You then must choose from a thousand different varieties of shiny metallic bits, sometimes with rocks in them, to fill that hole in with.  Which leads me to the question, on your body, what looks better? Skin, or shiny bits of metal? The answer is quite obvious. If metal indeed looked better, Robocop would have got all the babes, but we know that didn't happen.   Worse than the actual ear piercings are the alternate areas you can get pierced. Navels, they're perfectly fine as they are, and don't need accecories. Tongues! Why in gods name! Think of all the eating it would interfere with. I'm sure it would interfere with other activities as well. Oh, and the ultimate in stupid fashion statements, piercing one's penis. Thats just wrong on multiple different levels.   So if you have to go punching holes through something, make it a file. An alternative suggestion would be to get a puncher and yoink someones hair off, that has in the past proved to be very amusing, and surprising for the unsuspecting victim.
