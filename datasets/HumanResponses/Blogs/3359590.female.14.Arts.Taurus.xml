      Yesterday, me and my mom got into a fight. Now understand, it's my persona to say things like "You can all burn in hell," etc. It's just who I am...I find it partially comical, seeing as I would never actually WISH for somone to go rot within the bowls of hell. During this fight, I told my mom 'I swear, I will stab with that knife." And I pointed to a rather large butcher's knife. I lost my 'puter privelages. Now, I can see how someone might take that as offensive. But my mom knows me, and she knows that even though I've gotten over the depression, my mind's still a fucking mess from when it happened.   However, I've had soem fun. Including seeing the following hillarious movie: http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/demented.php ZEEKY BOGGY DOOG! *Nuclear Explosion*  LMFAO! Anywho...another high point was when I finally screwed Miss. Z over without her knowing. She has a TV Screen in her classroom that she watches God knows what kinds of tape on. I disconected the TV from the []D[]V[]D[] and the [-o-VHS-o-] player. So now, she can't watch shit. ALL HAIL THE MASTER OF RE-WIRING! YAH!  I also had a great conversation with Marc, a school friend. Oi, he's great.  AND JAN IS BACK! She had good MIA for two days. My fucking mom pulled me away to do Spanish. Then she randomly decides to throw Math in there. I feel really BAD for her. Always leaving her like that...  And I've realized something through all of this. My mom told Dr. B, my Physchitrist, that I've been having darker thoughts. That's true, but since I haven't been able to use the 'puter lately, that is partially her fault because I vent the stress of my reality through writing. People don't think that my life is tough, dificult, depressing for me. Well, first off, YOU FUCKING TRY AND BE 'HAPPY' WHEN YOU'VE JUST GONE THROUGH 30 DAYS OF YOUR LIFE FEELING LIKE YOU COULD KILL YOURSELF,  EVERYDAY !! GOD DAMN IT, I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM REALIZE I HAD ACTUALLY ALMOST STABBED MYSELF! Secondly, YOU ASSHATS DON'T EVEN HAVE THE SLIGHTEST UNDERSTANDING OF MY MENTAL PROCESSES. IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE FUCK LIFE IS LIKE FOR ME, THEN DON'T FUCKING RIDICULE ME BECAUSE I CHOOSE TO DO SOMETHING! WALK IN SOMEONE'S FUCKING SHOES BEFORE YOU START GIVING THEM GOD DAMNED LIFE LESSONS, WHICH ARE INCOHERENTLY WRONG BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT! YOU'RE ALL FUCKING RETARDS, I DON'T CARE IF YOUR GRADUATING COLLEGE. IT TAKES MORE THEN BEING ABLE TO COME UP WITH A GOOD PUT-DOWN TO BE A SMART, NICE PERSON! GOD!  Okay...sorry...I'm just REALLY pissed off right now, and I needed to vent some steam. So I just did...  -~*Kyora*~-

      Today, after making most of the day through school, the very last minute, I discovered something. 8th Grade can no longer do bus duty. It may not sound like such a big deal, and really, it isn't. However, why I'm pissed off is not WHAT, it's WHY. But, let me explain something to you. The 7th Grade gets Free Pizza parties once every fuggin' week. We may have gotten just as many in 7th Grade, but WE PAYED FOR THEM. And I'm not just saying that, I KNOW. They leave lunch early everyday because they go outside. 8th grade, go outside for lunch? HA! As if that'll happen. They say we have locker privilages. The only reason we have LOCKERS is because it'd be impossible to fit all our stuff inside out desks. And one point, we had our 'Locker Privilages' revoked because we were 'so loud while changing periods.' Of course, they couldn't keep this for long because of retaliation from parents, the fact that we couldn't fit all the fucking stuff they gave us in our 'desks' and the retaliation from the students. During that time, we had to carry all of our books from the first perioid until lunch, and then until we left. We could only restock during Social, which happened normally last period. You have no idea the amount of suckage that was. Although, again, it's all apart of 8th Grade at St. Shit-adicts. Ya know, its one thing when ya think life is hard, because it most certainly is. However, when someone is just so fucking stupid that you just really don't CARE if you fail, get detention, whatever, then they KNOW they're do something wrong. Okay, sorry about that. I'm not THAT angry over the whole matter, it just annoys me. Oder den dat, today was great. Got to watch Monster House & Garage, got to hand in my Science thinger, so that's outta the way, and I had NO HOMEWORK! w00t! The best part? I FINALLY HAVE DR. B TOMORROW!!!!!!!! YAY!!!!!  ~*Kyora*~

      Just got back from the boringist place on the planet, Chataqua. Why? Ok, I'm not a real out-doorsy person, I like staying inside and writing/drawing, although I will ocasinally draw outside. The writing requires my computer, however, because my handwriting is illegiable even by myself. Once down in Chataqua, however, I could no longer do these things. To me, Chataqua is th ekind of place to go to if you're older: As in, you like vacations in quite, peaceful places. However, I can't stand quite. So, naturally, I hate Chataqua. I really do. And now, guess what? I've got some shit-ass report on Galileo Galilei to do. It's HARD, damn it, and my mom keeps expecting it to be done the minute she steps in here. I hate her too. FAZHIR'ABLGOG!!!!!!!! Ok, so I've got very little time to spend here, so I must be going. Buh bye.  ~*Kyora*~
