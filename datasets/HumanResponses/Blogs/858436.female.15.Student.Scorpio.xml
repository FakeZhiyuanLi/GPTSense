      Hey. Yep, this is my blog thing. Enjoy. :-)  Today was uneventful. Went to school. I did okay on my  Tom Sawyer  test. Not as good of a score as I would have liked to get, but oh well. Went to lunch. Laura bought me a soda since she owed me a lunch punch. Spilled some on my shirt, but I guess my shirt is liquid repellent or something because it didn't even soak in, which was a miracle. Haha.  Came home, got on AOL, that was it.  Virginia is spening the night out. Yes! "Seabiscuit" is in town, and me being the dork that I am, might go see it with Mary if I can ever get a hold of her! Oh well.   I'm nominated for homeroom rep., but I think that J.P. guy will win it... ah well.  Better get off the computer before I get struck by lightning! ;-)

      Peer Helpers was fun today. :-) The "Bog of Stench" game or something like that. It was funn.  Tomorrow is the dance! I'm going over to Caro's house before the dance to get ready with she and Allison, and they might get to spend the night afterwards. :-) I wish I had a date, but I'm going with the girls so it'll be fun! :-D  And guess who missed only ONE on their PHYSICS QUIZ?!? ME!!! Hell yeah! Maybe I'll get partial credit, because I named four rays, but not in frequency order. I didn't know the order. Whoops.

      Well, today my day started off with the words "OH SHIT!" It was 6:30 A.M. and I was just waking up. So I had 20 minutes to get dressed, to my hair and makeup and get out the door. So I didn't have time to shower, but I didn't smell too bad. Haha. Then I got in the car and was doing my makeup, when I spilled liquid foundation all over the seats and on my pants. It came out of the seat and most of it off my pants when I got to school and washed it off. So things weren't as bad as I thought they'd be. Today was a nice day, in fact. It just was. Nothing pivotal happened, it was just a nice day.  If you haven't heard the acoustic version of "Come Back to Bed" by John Mayer, I suggest you do it. What a beautiful song. OMG. On the "Heavier Things" album, it sounds country western and I hate it, but plain acoustics, it's gorgeous. This is the 4th time in a row I've listened to it.  And Sarah said she'll introduce me to some of Brandon's friends, which I'm looking forward too. ;-)  Make that the 6th time I've listened to it.

      The weekend was fine. Babysat on Saturday and got 40 bucks! That's always fun, especially when the kids are as easy as they were.   Chances are I'll be going to the dance single. Ah well. Going with friends will be fun, right? Of course. It'll be a lot of fun. It would just be cool to have a date, y'know? I'm sick of being single. Lol. Even if I just had guy friends, that would be cool. I really don't have any guy friends. Being around girls all the time gets boring.  Anyyywho.... I guess I'll go do homework.

      Today was the kick-off for Activity Week. I laughed so hard at the assembly today that I almost had tears in my eyes! Haha.  And tonight was the freshman dinner. I worked outside at the carwash. Caro and I hung out with Haley Bohnert. She is the sweetest person ever! OMG I love her! Hehe! :-P And I met Demi, Jessica, and Destiny too. They're sweet girls as well. :-)  I am so hyper right now! I can't stop laughing and I'm not talking to anyone! That's what I get for drinking like, 1 iced tea at the dinner and 2 Pepsis at home! :-D

      School was fine today. I'm bummed out that I have a C in Physics and a C+ in Geometry, but oh well I guess. I have an A in Civics and an A+ in Theology. English, ha, I'll be happy to get a B. I hate that class. I don't like any of my female teachers. Well, I like Mrs. Choir Seyer. But that's it. Mrs. Welker and Mrs. Ha I cannot stand.  I got my outfit for the dance. :-) It's a sleeveless burgundy/red top with a funky collar thing, and these pants that are kinda khaki, but they're not. And they have these buttons up the two front sides. Very cute. :-) If only I had a date! Haha.  Later kids.

      School was fine today. Nothing exciting really.  Got hit in the head with a volleyball in P.E. I wasn't paying attention, and Chrissy Renick served and swacked me in the side of the head. It didn't hurt but was really embarassing. It's alright though. :-)  And who is STILL date-less for Activity Week dance? Me! Of course. Lol. Me being the freaking loser that I am. Haha. Ah well.  Going to Wal-Mart tonight to get the new John Mayer CD. I'm excited. :-)   I'm also going to Memphis tomorrow, and I'm excited about that as well.  Laterrr.

      Hey hey.   My dad decided to be a bitch last night. Made me feel bad about getting a C on my physics test and a C+ on my midterm Geometry grade. And he's one to talk, he can't even help me with my homework half the time! Whatever. Nothing satisifies him. Nothing that I do, at least. He said I'm not trying as hard as I should. Ha! I think I did okay on my geometry test today, but who knows. School is so uneventful. Nothing exciting ever really happens. I pray to God that my lunch shift switches next semester, otherwise that would just suck biiiiiiig time.  Got bitched out by Evelyn today for being late for carpool. Sarah and I were trying so hard not to crack up. :-)  Hey, um, yeah, if you know anybody else at ND with AIM, tell them my screen name, because, yeah just do it. Haha.  G'bye.

      Tomorrow the new John Mayer CD comes out! I'm quite excited. Just need to get to Wal-Mart to get it. :-)  Had a fun time at Mandy's. I'm still worried about Al not being in training, but hopefully things will work out. He was good when I rode him. We were gonna go on a trail ride, and I didn't really want to ride Al considering that his left front ankle was a little swollen from a cut. So I rode one of Mandy's horses. It was really fun. And it's good that I decided not to ride Al on the trail, because we rode maybe five miles! We were in the woods, as well. And through this really deep creek. It was really cool.  Let's see, what else. Saturday I'm going to Memphis with my grandmother. To see a play. And shop. 'Twill be fun, indeed.  Did I mention that Chris is freaking hilarious? He cracks me up, dude.  Tomorrow I have a geometry test. Oh joy. I have a C+ in that class and my dad still seems disappointed. And I'm ranked 17 out of 28! Hmph. I told him how I got a C on my physics test and he seemed disappointed too. Well, sorry that ND is a LITTLE bit harder than SFX! My God! He doesn't even get geometry, and he's all mad at me?! He said he wasn't mad, but he said my grades need to be higher. Yeah whatever. I'm trying, okay? I'm trying.  I need to start planning an outfit for Activity Week dance. I can't decide whether or not I should wear a skirt or pants and a cool shirt. For some reason, I'm envisioning red pants and a sleeveless black top, maybe a sleeveless black turtleneck? Hm... if only I had MONEY! Haha.  P.E. today was okay, since we didn't have to do anything with balls. We jumped over boxes. I did all of them except the last one. I didn't even try that one to spare myself the embarassment. Haha. If only we could ride horses for P.E.... now I'd enjoy that class.   Mkay, this post is long enough.

      Okay, this post better go through, because I've already typed it out twice and my dumbass computer keeps screwing up!!!!!!  I didn't win homeroom rep. J.P. won it. Ah well. I'm not upset about it. I'm the freshman rep. for Blue Crew, but that's not really a big deal. Haha.   Um, I think I bombed my Physics test, and I'm not sure about Geometry. I hate those classes. With a passion.  P.E. was hell today. We had to play volleyball and I felt like an idiot. Why? Because I suck at sports! Of course everyone else on my team was good at it, but I didn't get made fun of, which is nice. At least, they didn't make fun of me in  front  of me. Lol.  I'm going to visit my friend Mandy tomorrow! We're gonna ride and stuff. It'll be fun. :-)  I met a guy that I kinda like. I'm pretty sure he doesn't know I like him, at least I hope I'm not being too obvious. ;-)  Fair starts next week. I'm excited, even though I'm not going to ride the rides because I'll freaking PUKE! Maybe someone will stand with me. Doubt it. Haha.   Things are fine, not much has happened. I'm whipped from getting up so early and doing so much work.   Dear God, PLEASE let this post go through!

      Last night was fun!  I stayed at Caro's house. Sarah and Alli were there as well. We went and saw "Uptown Girls" which was really cute. Went back to Caro's house. Ate really good hamburgers. Hehe. Chilled most of the night. Her mom has the best dip ever. I ate so much food I think I gained ten pounds. Haha. We can't wait to get our nails done. :-)  I love Red Fusion. :-D  Came home. Did homework. Chilled. My breath smells like Doritos. Haha. I still have Theology. Better go do that.

      Not much has happened lately. I've been having some whacked out dreams as always. On Thursday night I had a dream that Sam, Caitlin, and I were at a bar dancing. Haha. And Caitlin was wearing a shirt that had flames on the front and said "the fire within us" and on the back it said "o.a.r." Then last night I had a dream that our little lunch group was at school having lunch, and Logan was going to beat up Matt because Matt was playing around and said I was weird. Yeah it was really strange... haha.  Might do something tomorrow if I can get some people together. Maybe the movies or something. My mom is being really stupid and yelling at everyone for the tiniest things and it's getting really annoying. I need to get out of the house.  13 days till my birthday! I'm really excited. :-D

      Well, I just had a long-ass post typed out but it got deleted. Ah well.  Went to Kaci's party tonight! It was a LOT of fun, I thought. We just hung around and stuff. Got some close contact in there now didn't we, Court and Cait?! Haha.   Just ate food, sat around the bonfire, laid on top of each other at the sacred ground as JP would say. :-P I had a great time. I became more comfortable around a lot of people I didn't know very well.   If there's one thing I've learned from being at ND so far, it's that you should give people a second chance after your first impression. Because a lot of times it's totally different that what you thought before.   Bye babes.

      Sorry I haven't been posting, I'm just too lazy to. Lol.  This post is mainly a collection of randomness from me. Lol.  School has been fine and all. Not much to say there. I have two C's, but all you can do is try. I was really tired from the excitement of the weekend, so I faked sick today and didn't go to school. Hehe.  Guys are great. If only I had one.  The LSU/Florida game was a BLAST! I had a ton of fun!

      Yeah I know it's a day late, but I'm saying it now anyway.  We just went to my grandmother's house and had lunch. I wish my aunt and uncle and cousins would have been there, but they were having all of my uncle's family over to their house, so they didn't come. I really want to have a normal holiday like we used to have.  We'd all go over to Mamaw and Daddy Sam's house and have the holiday lunch. Mamaw, Daddy Sam, Mom, Dad, Virginia, Charles, Aunt Rebel, Uncle Mark, Holt, and Boothe would all be there. And sometimes Ovie and Glennon. We would all eat and talk and visit, and if it was Christmas, we would open gifts after we ate.   But then holidays got different. For Thanksgiving 2001, we went to Alabama instead. For that Christmas, we had my mom's family over and then we went to Mamaw and Daddy Sam's later and we were the only people there. And Easter... *sighs* It was a fairly normal Easter. We did the egg stuff at my house, but then all the Storys were going to our new cousin's christening party. So I got to see alllllll of my family. But that was the last time I saw my grandfather. He was sitting in a chair, talking and laughing with all the other old people. I ran up to him and threw my arms around him. "Happy Easter, Daddy Sam!" I said. "Happy Easter, Madeline!" he said with a hug back. Then I ran off to talk to some cousins. And those were the last words we said. Why didn't I tell him I loved him? THat's what hurt me so much when he died 9 days later. My dad told me that Daddy Sam was sure he knew I loved him, but why didn't I tell him? Why didn't I sit down and talk to him?   Don't wait till it's too late to tell someone you love them.  *breathes*  Okay, on a lighter note...  EVERYONE: GO TO TJ'S ON SATURDAY! I MEAN IT! I'VE NEVER BEEN AND NEITHER HAS SARA OR ALLIE, AND WE WANNA GO! SO BE THERE OR BE SQUARE! :-P   Seriously, go to TJ's. We're spreading the word around. :-D

      Let's see, things are going a little rough between my parents and I right now. I didn't speak to my dad for about 4 days. I'm on okay terms with him right now, but I'm still mad at him. And worried about other things.   We went to the LSU/Mizzou game. That was a lot of fun.  My parents are out of town this weekend. My grandmother is staying with my brother, sister, and me. It's pretty fun.  I'm having a party for the ND/Sikeston basketball game when they play in Sikeston. I think it's December 19th? Or something like that. Spread the word! Hehe.  Wanna see my Christmas list? I know you do. Haha. My grandmother had me make one last night. It's not very big this year.  Madeline's Christmas List:  Money Accessories and such If you want to get me a gift certificate, here are the stores you can choose from: Wet Seal, American Eagle, Aeropostale, PacSun, and Hollister's if it's open in Cape yet.

      My grades weren't that bad. My lowest ones were Cs in Geometry and Physics. All that stressing out for nothing! Haha. My dad did put a timer on the internet now though, so I can only be online for 1 hour a day, which sucks really bad. Ah well.  So tonight was Halloween. I went to Beth's and we went to that haunted house thing. It was FREAKING SCARY! I screamed every two seconds. And my eyes were closed half the frickin time! I just held on to Kaci and Emily. Haha. And there was this one part where I saw this little opening in the wall that led outside, so I jumped outta there because I thought you were supposed to. I was all relieved because I saw Jack and everyone out there, but turns out, I wasn't supposed to jump out of the hole, so I had to go back in. Haha. Yeah it was a lot of fun. Sorry for screaming in your ear, Kaci!

      Went to the game last night. ND won! It was fun. There weren't a ton of people there, but I did see Caitlin, Emily, Allie, and Sara. They are playing Charleston right now, so I'm wondering how that goes...  Well, I was going to stay with Mandy for a few days during break while Mom, Virginia, and Charles were at the beach at Dad was at the Sugar Bowl, but she's going to Cancun. I really wanted to stay here and spend New Year's with all my friends, but ah well.   So I'm leaving tomorrow morning for Pt. Clear, Alabama. About 30 minutes away from Gulf Shores. The beach is right across the sidewalk from my grandmother's house. We have our own pier and everything. It's really nice. I just wanted to be at home. But... things didn't work out.   My cell phone number is 573-258-0934. Text or call me, please! I don't care who you are. I'd love to hear from everyone and hear what's up. If you give me your address, I'll even send you a postcard.   Love you all.

      Sara Richter is the funniest person alive. She's so random! I love her!  After reading Laura's site, I've been fighting the temptation to steal her survey really hard. I promise. No surveys for at least 3 days.  I've been staying up so late every night! I love staying up late, but everyone is no fun and they all go to bed, leaving me all alone on MSN. What's up with sleep anyway?  Because of the time right now, it's Christmas Eve! Yeah! I love Christmas so much. Not just because of the gifts and stuff, but just because of the whole feeling you get leading up to it. You look forward to it for months. It's kind of sad the day after Christmas. Nothing too look forward too except boring old January. At least you have New Year's, though.  I GOT MY PERMIT!!! Yes, Madeline Grace Story is now going to be driving on the roads, so watch out! I went to the armory today and took the test. The guy graded it right in front of me, so I saw that I missed 5. I didn't miss any on the vision or sign tests. I'm so happy! So tonight I wanted to just drive around, so my mom said fine if we go to the grocery. So after getting in there (and jumping the curb, yikes) she made me go in and get all the stuff. I felt like Kevin McCallister off of "Home Alone" being all young and shopping for groceries. Haha. So then we drove around a bit and went by Sarah's house and honked the horn.  My New Year's Resolutions:  1. Be more outgoing - I don't people to think I'm some bitch that hates everyone, so I'm going to start saying hi to people more and just being more outgoing. 2. Study more - Enough said. 3. Stop procrastinating so much - Enough said. 4. Have more fun - I have an old soul, and I need to act younger.

      I'm writing about a few of the first impressions I got of people when I first started at ND. If your name isn't on here, it's not because I don't like you! Lol. These are impressions that I've found to be completely the opposite of what the person is really like, or ones that are completely the same.    Samantha Brandon :   I thought she was shy. Maybe because when she sat behind me in Physics and Mr. G called on her, she was all quiet and stuff. I would be too if I had just moved here.   Sara Richter :  I knew she was wild and crazy all along! Lol. At the lock-in when she just would not stop laughing, I knew that we were going to have an interesting lunch shift.   Haley Bohnert :  I just didn't see how someone could be so  nice  all the time. I was really quiet and shy at the beginning of school, and one day in Physics, she just looked at me and smiled. I wasn't sure if she was smiling at me or at someone behind me, so I just kind of looked away. But she did it again, so I smiled back. Then at the car wash, I found out how sweet and fun she is.   Jack Wedemeier :  We have a ton of classes together, so he was really nice and said hi and stuff on the first day. Then at the lock-in his sporty competitiveness came out and I thought he was pretty cocky. But I found out that he really isn't, and that a lot of times he's just joking around being Jack.   Matt Rosenquist :  I thought Matt was kind of stand-offish. Like he really didn't want to be around anybody. Lol, because on the first day our lunch shift was walking around the school building, and some teacher kept asking him if he wanted somebody to hold his planner since he was on crutches. I felt really sorry for him. He kept refusing, saying that he'd carry it himself. I didn't know quite what to think of him. But I guess I'd be pissed off too if I had to start school on crutches. But then at the lock-in we were next to each other for a few of the games, and I found out that he is kind of quiet at first, but once you get talking, he's so nice.    Allison Bode :  At first I thougt Allie was going to be shy, uptight, not really wanting to have fun. Her jewelry all matched her outfit, her nails were perfect, and her hair never looks bad. Geeze was I wrong! Allie is crazy, and I love her to death!   Myself :  People usually think that I am quiet and too serious. Trust me, I'm definitely not! Once you get talking to me, I'm really a nice person. Trust me. Sometimes I am shy until I get talking.  If anyone is reading this, what was your first impression of me? Be honest. It would be interesting to hear.

      America Online is a piece of crap! Ugh!  Today this error thing kept popping up, so I couldn't get online, so after 2 phone calls with AOL people, I've finally fixed it. First, I talked to some middle Eastern guy I could hardly understand, and he didn't help. Then I talked to Melvin, another middle Eastern guy that I could understand, and after an hour on the phone, we got it fixed. Don't waste your money on AOL!  Today I sat around the house and did nothing. It was boring.  I'm not finished on anyone's Christmas presents at all! Well, I have my sister's and my mom is getting my brother's for me, but that's it. Yikes.   Mmm... peppermint stick ice cream.

      If you don't watch The OC, it's an awesome show. My favorite one. And it has such awesome music. This song in particular strikes me as... beautiful. It's so pretty.  "Strange and Beautiful" by Aqualung  I've been watching your world from afar I've been trying to be where you are And I've been secretly falling apart Unseen To me, you're strange and you're beautiful You'd be so perfect with me But you just can't see You turn every head but you don't see me  I'll put a spell on you You fall asleep When I put a spell on you And when I wake you I'll be the first thing you see And you'll realise that you love me  Yeah Ye-ah  Sometimes the last thing you want comes in first Sometimes the first thing you want never comes But I know that waiting is all you can do Sometimes  I'll put a spell on you You fall asleep I'll put a spell on you And when I wake you I'll be the first thing you see And you'll realise that you love me  I'll put a spell on you You fall asleep Cause I put a spell on you  And when I wake you I'll be the first thing you see And you'll realise that you love me, yeah  Yeah Ye-ah Yeah Ye-ah

      Thank you, sweet JESUS! Christmas Break is HERE!  Last night... went to my little sister and brother's Christmas play. My parents are very patient people, having to watch those things since 1996. It was weird seeing one and not being in it. I never knew they were so bad... haha.  Tonight... went to the ND vs. Sikeston game. It was fun. ND did fine until we went into overtime, then we lost by 16 points. It was fun seeing everyone though. Kaci's Mountain Dew is a slut hehe. My phobia of walking into places by myself turned out okay when I saw Sam and Destiny in the Commons, so I walked in with them, since I halfway know Sam.  Oh, I didn't tell you about my permit! Well, last Tuesday I was FINALLY ready to go take it. We were in the car, and then we realized that you have to have a birth certificate. Mom says she will get it the next day and I'll go to Charleston to take it. So I'm all pumped. The next day? SHE LOST IT! SHE COULDN'T FIND IT! So my dad called the state of Virginia and we got it in the mail today. So I better damn well pass that test on Tuesday! Otherwise I will be PISSED! Haha  I hope I see everyone during break. I have to go to the beach, and I don't want to. I told Jack to go for me. Give me your address and I'll send you a postcard! Haha.

      The dance was FUN! Much more fun that the Activity Week one. I had a great time!  I met Kaci, Goodson, Emily, and Claire over at the Bira's house. We got ready and stuff and then went to the Pasta House. Zach Cook, Zach Capriola, Squeeb, Richard, Brett, Matt, Kaci, Emily, Goodson, Emily, Cort, Lindz, and I all went to dinner together. It was very nice.   And then we headed to the dance. (Operation Wallpaper didn't succeed, Kaci and Emily, but it will by the end of this year!!!) Everyone looked so nice. Especially the guys in ties. Kaci and I have a fetish over guys in ties.   And now I'm back home, nice and comfy in my pajamas, which is a nice change from my dress because I haven't been able to breathe since 3:30! I took my hair down, and it's all gunky with hair spray, but I'll just wash it in the morning.  A bunch of guys are over at Squeeb's house, and I contemplated on asking Sarah if she wanted to go over there and crash it with me, but I decided against it. Hehe.

      It can't snow tonight! The Christmas dance CAN'T get snowed out!  Yep, Christmas dance is tomorrow. I'm excited. I'm lacking in the date department, but I'm going with the girls so it's going to be more fun anyway. I'm headed over to the lovely Claire Bira's house at 4:00 to primp, and then we are out to the Pasta House. At first it was Bella Italia, but since a bajillion people are going, we decided against it. So Claire, Claire Goodson, Kaci, Emily, maybe Aimee?, me, Matt, Brett, and Zach are going to Pasta House. It'll be fun. :-)  Since my fingers are too cold to type, I'm being random again...  *My fingers are healed.  *I'm getting my hair done tomorrow.  *I'm going to die during finals.  *We have a 90% chance of snow tonight.  *Sara and Allie have gone insane within this past week.  *Some guy stole Sara's phone and left me a hilarious voice message.  *I'm going out to eat in a formal dress tomorrow, which I have never done.  Goodnight kids.

      THANK GOD I NEVER HAVE TO SING THAT STUPID SONG AGAIN! YES!  Mixed Chorus Christmas concert was tonight. We weren't as bad as I thought we'd be. Haha. We were actually pretty good. Chrissy and Jessica have such pretty voices. They sounded very nice.  Let's see, "I didn't do much this weekend... dunno if that's good or bad." Haha Matt. The words seem right. Um, I babysat on Friday and Saturday night for the O'Brien's. They are the EASIEST and sweetest kids ever. Friday I just had to babysit Annie Georgia and got $25 for that. Saturday it was Annie Georgia and Gavin, and they gave me a Christmas present! It was so sweet. Then Mr. O'Brien brought me home and gave me the money in the car. I didn't look at it until I got inside, and it was $40! I was only there for 5 hours, so I called them and told them that I thought they overpaid me, and maybe they meant to give me a $25 and $5 instead of two $20s. Mrs. O'Brien said no, that they were grateful that I could babysit and that they gave me some extra money for Christmas. Such sweet people!  I haven't done much on my Theology project. I have to do Geometry too. And Tuesday I have an English test, Civics Test, Physics quiz, and Theology project due. I want to bring all of my grades up, so when I don't do so well on my Geometry final and my grade is, ahem, awful, my parents won't be too terribly angry.  Mandy and I have decided that we want boyfriends by next July so we can call them from Nationals and tell them how we did. Haha. We're losers.   I tried on my Christmas dance dress today. It fits. The top it tighter than it was in May. But hey, people grow. But I'm kind of pissed anyway. So this week, no junk food for Madeline. Nope. No snacks either. Just meals. And really, that's only 1 meal a day, because ND food is nasty and I hardly even eat the salads anymore. If we're having chicken nuggets or crispitos, I'll eat it. Otherwise, it'll just be dinner lol.  I *might* go down to Pt. Clear for New Year's. But I don't really want to. But I do. If my Aunt Daly and her kids are going to be there, then I'll go. Because my cousin Scears is awesome, and my Aunt Daly for that matter. If they aren't going to be there, then I'll just stay here and hang out with everyone. Maybe I'll have a party of some sort. I hate living in Sikeston though, because all my friends would have to haul-ass down here.   More Randomness:  *I keep biting my nails, and now I have sores on my fingers. So I've doused them in Polysporin, and right now I have Band-Aids on 6 of my fingers.  *My grandmother went to by me the OAR CD, but she asked for OAK. Haha.  *Uncle Matt and Aunt Amy's babies from Russia won't be here till January.  *I'm as pale as a ghost.  *My little sister saw a picture of Jack's back in the ND newspaper and said he looked hot from the back and she really wants to see his little brothers.  *My little brother is weird.  *"Scent of a Woman" is an awesome movie.  *My cell phone is being stupid. 258-0934 in case you wanted to know.  *Matt and I don't have social lives. So call me sometime and we can do something. And call him too. Because he's a nice guy.  *LSU IS GOING TO THE SUGAR BOWL, BABY! GEAUX TIGERS! My dad was telling me and he got all choked up with tears in his eyes. It was touching and funny at the same time.  *I had two big chunks of bourbon fudge today. My mom said it was way too strong for her, but I love it. :-)

      I hate geometry. With a passion. And guess what I find out? Mrs. Ha won't be giving us a study guide for finals. We have 8 to 10 proofs and she won't tell us the number of steps either. That's such bullshit! Does she WANT everyone to flunk? Sure seems that way. I'm already a low C in that class. This isn't good.  WANTED: A date for the Christmas dance. *HINT HINT* :-P  Shoutouts (since I'm extremely bored): Kaci Jean: Love ya tons babe! We are gonna be soooo pumped to flunk this final in geometry! Pumped to flunk and ready to walk down the hallway of death! :-P Sara: I just want some freakin' implants! Uh... I said "did you..?" OMG I almost died! Allie: A Moment Like This! We're gonna whip out the spotlights and everything. Hehe.

      I'm trying to get something together for tonight but nobody is home! I called Sara's cell and nobody answered, Allie can't do anything tonight, Sarah is babysitting tonight and tomorrow, and then Kaci is supposed to call me back in about 15 minutes. I might call Caro too, I dunno. I just want to do something tonight! Lol. Last night nobody was online, it was gay. But I still managed to stay up until 3 AM doing nothing haha.   If you can't already tell, I have a wide range of music likes. I'm a huge John Mayer fan, I love O.A.R., Dave Matthews Band... but I also am a Doors fan, and some 80s music is pretty good. This song is one of my favorites. I guess you'd have to actually hear it to get the full effect, but yeah. Mhm.  "Case in point: their other Songs from the Big Chair-spawned, No. 1 hit, "Everybody Wants to Rule the World," was a meditative contemplation of the struggle for power within interpersonal relationships as a metaphor for global supremacy--which, thank god, had a good beat so you could at least dance to it." --Billy Altman  One of the best songs ever made...  Everybody Wants to Rule the World  Welcome to your life There's no turning back Even while sleep We will find you Acting on your best behaviour Turn your back on mother nature Everybody wants to rule the world It's my own design It's my own remorse Help me to decide Help make the most Of freedom and of pleasure Nothing ever lasts forever Everybody wants to rule the world There's a room where the light won't find you Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down When they do I'll be right behind you So glad we've almost made it So sad they had fade it Everybody wants to rule the world I can't stand this indecision Married with a lack of vision Everybody wants to rule the world Say that you'll never never never need it One headline why believe it? Everybody wants to rule the world All for freedom and for pleasure Nothing ever lasts forever Everybody wants to rule the world  That's it for now...

      I have never been so thankful for a Friday. This week was so retarded.  Today I had a motherload of civics to do that I finished most of in homeroom. Physics was bizarre! We had that A schedule thing y'know, and Mr. G was going psycho! It was a very strange thing. It was pretty funny.  Then at lunch Shannon told Kaci and me the proofs we needed to know for the Geometry quiz. I had those things freaking MEMORIZED! By God, I was going to get those damn proofs RIGHT! It was going to be my first time ever. But... of course we get the quiz that has different proofs! That really made me mad. They weren't very long though so I didn't have to totally BS my way through them.   Mixed Chorus.. GEEZE! My blushing problem is out of control! I had to look Mitch Glueck in the eyes and he kept pointing at his eyes and then at me and I turned RED! I mean RED! I can't help it! I don't mean to! Sometimes I don't even know I am blushing! Geeze Louise. I don't even like him like that, I mean, I hardly know him!  Well, it's midnight and NOBODY is online! What's up with that? That's bizarre.   So now I'm just chilling. I just wanted to stay at home tonight and get over this gay week. It was seriously just stupid. Tonight is nice, Virginia AND Charles are both spending the night out with friends so I'm an only child! I came home and nobody was home so I called my mom's cell and she was over at Ginger's house and then they went to dinner or something and then my dad got home around 4:00. And of course he didn't want to cook so we called Yang's and got some food, so I got to sit in front of the TV watching "The Real World" and eat Chinese food. Quite nice. Then I CLEANED my room! Whoa! Haha. I had all these plastic boxes under my bed with all this crap in them and I threw a bunch of it away, so now I'm down to 1 box of junk, my horse show scrapbook box, and then another box that I keep all of my notes in. Haha I'm such a packrat. But I got rid of 2 big boxes so I'm proud of myself.   Hm.. well if you wanna do something tomorrow call me! Because I want to do something! And... if you're reading this and don't know my number it's 471-4524 and the cell is 258-0934. Haha that was gay but I felt like saying that. Night!

      Mkay, so yesterday was just an all around SUCKY day! I swear nothing went right. Today was better. But then I get home and my mom said she called Mrs. Ha and blah blah blah. So I am getting a tutor on Monday. John Kiblinger. Don't know who he is. I would have been totally fine with this if she would have told me beforehand instead of acting like I'm in the damn 3rd grade. I DON'T like people checking up on me behind my back. I am a very independent person and I don't want to treated like I'm freaking 5 years old. This really pisses me off.   Alright enough of that. I STILL have ea bunch of civics that I haven't done and left it at school. I just keep forgetting! I don't know what my problem is. So tomorrow I'm going to have to rush through it before school since I have the class 2nd hour. I am SUPPOSED to be in 3rd hour but nooo my art class just had to get screwed up and then screw up everything else. Geeze.   ENOUGH OF THAT! Haha everything today is in caps. Today was that all school mass. It was really short. But it was nice.. Mhm. I think I'm gonna go finish making everyone's Christmas presents.. yeah a month late but WHATEVER!

      Well, I was going to go up to Cape tonight to do something with Allie and Sara, but then we heard about a freezing rain thing so now I can't go. :-( Ah well.  Went shopping today. It wasn't a huge power shopping trip, but I got some things I needed. A khaki Tommy skirt I can wear to school when it's warmer and some cute Tommy khakis, but they're too long. I tried them on for Mamaw at home and she said it would be hard to hem them, so we're going to Paducah tomorrow to see if we can find them in regular instead of long lol. And then I got a baseball type shirt from Gap that's green and says "Brooklyn" on it. It's cute.  Caitlin, Jack, AND Caroline's birthdays are all this week! Hehe. Caitlin is on Monday, Jack is on Wednesday, and Caroline on Thursday. Pretty neat.

      Friday at last!  First off, I want to say this. If I ever start sounding obsessed, tell me, okay? Because I don't want to sound psycho.  Almost done with my poetry project. Just have to write the paper on it. Geeze. Monday we have a vocab sheet due and quiz and poetry project due, and Tuesday we have a rough draft, plan, and brainstorm due for our hobby essays. Man!  Tomorrow I'm going shopping with Virginia and Mamaw. In Carbondale and Marion. There's a skirt in Hollister that I really want and I might get it. I dunno.   What's up with everyone going to bed? Geeze. Nobody's online. Lol.  I got my nails done hehe. They're pink. I'm so in love with this color. "Pink-ing of You." It is so pretty! It matches me. I think I might buy it lol.  Hrm.. don't have much to say...

      Let's see... haven't updated in a while. I'll go over my weekend.  Saturday I went up to Anna to stay with Mandy. It was raining so we couldn't ride, so that night we went to the Carbondale mall, saw a movie, and then went out to eat with some of her friends at Fazolli's.   Sunday we trailered Al and Sy up to Todd's since he has an indoor ring. OMG was that eventful. Al was flipping out from the trailer. Long story, but we got there and back safely so it was good. Then that night we rented Seabiscuit and Crossroads and stayed at home, since it was snowing.  Monday we went to the mall again with another one of Mandy's friends. And then I went home.  Yep, it was a nice weekend. Tuesday was school and then that night I got pissed at my parents because they don't think I shoudl go to the Central/ND game next week since "my grades aren't good enough". Grr... And then today I was really sick so I stayed home. Tonight we're supposed to go have dinner since Charles's bday is tomorrow, but I'm going to stay home.  Guess that's all for now.

      I'm talking to him rightthisverysecond.  And I've run out of things to say, like an idiot. Mhm.  What sucks is knowing that maybe if you tried a little harder, talked a little bit more, you could have a chance with him. It sucks.  Guess how long I've liked him? Since  September . How pathetic is that? I've liked him for almost 4 months and nothing at all has happened. I've liked him for a third of a year. Geeze.   Can't get a ride to Cape tonight... so pissed. I can't WAIT until I can freaking DRIVE MYSELF UP THERE WHENEVER I WANT!  "Doesn't it just make you want to give him a hug?" Haha... don't step on it!!  Silence. Mhm. No more conversation.  Gonna go start working on my poetry project.. SINCE SIKESTON IS GAY AND CAN'T GET A SOCIAL LIFE AND GO TO THE GAME AND GIVE ME A RIDE!!!!

      Frozen peanut butter cookie dough is too good. I need to stop eating it now before I get sick.  Let's see... today was Monday. Retarded Mondays as usual. Everyone's tired, doesn't have homework done, and is rather blah. At least I don't have much homework. Just some prepare stuff for Geometry, which I am completely retarded in. I don't know how I got in an advanced math class in the first place.   Enough bitching. Lol. I vent and rant too much. Have you ever noticed how in P.E. all we listen to his heavy metal stuff? Trying to get us motivated to pump the iron? Haha. Allie and I made that observation today.  Thursday I said that Virginia wanted to see Jack. Well, she saw him. And she thinks he's "sooo fine!" Lmao! That is just too funny. I told Kaci and he thought it was hilarious too. She said I need to tell Jack and that he'd die laughing. Either that or think my family is weird haha.  Let's see what else... had and english vocab test today. Easy. Physics lab today.. easy for once! Geometry.. hard and confusing as always. I finished my carving for art. It's a piggy bank. Haha.  What else can I add to this long post... oh yes, I think everyone in the world now knows who I like. And I like him a lot.

      Tonight was homecoming! Sooo much fun. We lost the games, but oh well. I got to see everyone, and it was just fun.  The dance was fun. I got by Brother David without him yelling at me for my shirt, so I was relieved, since Haley's covered a lot more than mine did and she still got in trouble. Um.. just danced and stuff lol. Ran around on Jack's crutches while he danced with Kaci. It was fun! Haha, I'd never used crutches before. Yes, I am a dork. :-P  My friends are my heroes. ;-)

Well, I'm gonna go eat dinner and then go to the awesome haha not outlet mall to find an outfit for tomorrow!

      Got home today. It was... eh. It was nice seeing family, but I got bored. At least it was warm.   Yesterday was the one year anniversary of Kelsie's mother passing away. Liz Hawkins. What an awesome person she was. She is missed very much.  I found out from Myka's xanga that Nathan passed away over break. That's so sad. I didn't know him. He was in my geometry class. It's still just heartbreaking.   Time to be random again.  *Mississippi must really love the song "It's My Life" by No Doubt, because I heard it on the radio about 45 million times.   *I feel... weird. "I'm weird but I'm feelin' fine." I don't know, I just don't feel myself.   *It feels good to be home and I can't wait to see everyone. :-)

I got a 22/30 on my last quiz! It doesn't sound that great, but honestly, that's the highest I've gotten in a long time. Lol.  Um.. not much to say.. haha.  Things I Want at the Moment:  Rooney's CD This one skirt from Hollister.. A pair of Hollister jeans Bath and Body Works Pleasures lotion in Sweet Pea And can't forget the boy.. hehe.  Hm.. I still have a bunch of birthday and babysitting money left. Maybe I'll just ask for the lotion for Easter or something. Yeah okay I'm being way random..

      I think that is now one of my favorite songs.. very pretty.  Babysat the O'Briens tonight. Gavin and Annie Georgia are the sweetest kids ever. I love those kids so much! I was tucking Annie Georgia in bed, and she was like, "Madeline, you are my favorite babysitter ever." And I was like "aww thank you so much, that's so sweet of you!" And she was like, "I love it so much when you babysit. It's so fun." It was so sweet.   Guys are so, frustrating. Like, I dunno, I like a guy a lot but I'm a loser and I am too shy to make a move or anything. The whole thing is stupid. Honestly, I don't even know him  that  well. I mean, yes, I do know him but we aren't close friends or anything. Why do I like a guy so much that I don't know extremely well? It's not for looks, even though he happens to be gorgeous. I just like him. But I don't know why, and that is frustrating.  Oh yes, The Lion King 1 1/2 is a kick ass movie haha. I watched it with Gavin and Annie Georgia. :-)

      Finally. It's about time I had fun!   Went to the game tonight. It was fun. I'm mad that they're all over, because I didn't go to many. Don't know why. Oh well. It was fun though. Got good seats, didn't we Claire? Muaha.  Did anyone see The O.C. on Wednesday? I'm so pissed! Ryan and Marissa CANNOT break up! NO NO NO! Haha it's pathetic that I am so absorbed in a TV show, but I actually like it more than THe Real World. *GASP* Hehe.  Since I'm lazy... I'll post some lyrics to a very great song.  Wonderwall by Ryan Adams  Today is gonna be the day That they're gonna give it back to you By now you should've somehow Realized what you gotta do I don't believe that anybody Feels the way I do about you now  Backbeat the word is on the street That the fire in your heart is out I'm sure you've heard it all before But you never really had a doubt I don't believe that anybody feels The way I do about you now  And all the roads we have to walk are winding And all the lights that lead the way are blinding There are many things that I would Like to say to you But I don't know how  I said maybe You're gonna be the one who saves me And after all You're my wonderwall  Today was gonna be the day But they'll never bring it back to you By now you should've somehow Realized what you're gotta do I don't believe that anybody Feels the way I do About you now  And all the roads we have to walk are winding And all the lights that lead the way are blinding There are many things that I would like to say to you But I don't know how  I said maybe You're gonna be the one that saves me You're gonna be the one that saves me And after all You're my wonderwall You're my wonderwall You're my wonderwall You're my wonderwall

      I think I will take Dori's advice. Life throws shit at you, but just keep swimmin', or try to at least.  Let's see.. last night my parents went out. YES! Virginia had Mimi spend the night and Charles was here so I had to "watch them" but it wasn't a big deal. They didn't bother me all night and my parents didn't get back until 1:00 AM. I hate a bunch of chocolate and played music really loud, it was nice.   This morning, none of us wanted to go to church, so Virginia, Mimi, and I pretended like we slept in so we didn't go haha. I'm sorry, God. I hung out in my TV room all day long. I only went downstairs when I had to. Like to refill on Diet Pepsi or something. Then my father called in to El Bracero's so we had dinner from there. Virginia and Charles had never seen "Finding Nemo" and I was extremely appauled. So my mother went and picked it up for us and Virginia, Charles, and I watched it up in Virginia and my TV room. Now I'm on MSN. Virginia tried to type "I love you and I want your sexy body" to a certain guy I was talking to.. hm wonder who that would be.   So yes, my weekend has pretty much revolved around my brother and sister. Today my mother started bitching at me for something, and I barely raised my voice in defense of myself. Then I got yelled at for yelling at her. I tried defending myself again, but she told me not to backtalk her. So whenever I try to defend myself, it's backtalk, but she is more than allowed to bitch me out. Makes sense. I still have barely spoken to Sam and Mary Ellen. My dad asked me if something was bothering me. Idiot. I swear, the intelligence level is this house is spellbinding.  Enough of my cynical-ness. I don't want my parents rubbing off on me. I am my own person and I don't want to be just like them.

      Grounded on a damn three day weekend.  And until "my grades come up."  Did they not forget that my geometry grade came up 2 percent in 3 days? Idiots. English has come up a ton, but "we're only worrying about physics and geometry."  Of course the good things go unnoticed. Why should the odds be for me? The world is pissed off at me. I don't know what I did wrong, but everything has decided to turn around. I feel like I'm no longer in control, and these 2 imbeciles are trying to fix things they don't know shit about.  Today I get home, and I'm not even home 20 minutes before I'm crying. I cried my eyes out yesterday, and I cried some more today. I don't think I've cried so much since my grandfather died. 4 months of angst and anguish have been released, and it's relieving yet scary at the same time.  Tonight I decided to start working on my theology paper, since I have nothing else to do. I go to our little library den thing, and start looking for a book because there are half a million in there on the shelves. My father buys all these weird off the wall books that are probably out of print now, so some we kind of interesting really. Then I found this one book that had nothing to do with religion but interested me. I sound pathetic guys, but on a Friday night, I was reading a psychology book. It was pretty confusing but cool. There was this quiz in the front with a million questions that gives you your personality type. I am an INFJ. It stands for some stuff, but I forgot. I read my description, and it was scary how much it matched me.   It says that INFJs like writing and make phenomenal psychiatrists and therapists, which is what I want to be. It went into detail about the type of person I am, and it was so exact. My personality only makes up 1 percent of the population, so it's really rare. Haha I'm awesome. And people who are so called psychics are INFJs and people who have ESP are always INFJs. Awesome, so maybe I'm psychic too.   I'm going to lose my mind this weekend, guys. Being here alone with a bunch of people who hate me. Virginia and I have been getting along tonight, so at least someone around here likes me. I have made minimal conversation with my parents. I don't even look at them. This isn't all just because I'm grounded. It's because I am so damn frustrated with all this shit they are giving me. Making me miserable is not going to encourage me. What kind of parenting is this? This whole afternoon I was just completely numb. And you know what my mother asks? "Well, what are you all upset about?" What a dumbass. If you have to ask, you probably don't deserve to know.  I hate how one day everything can be perfect and the next everything is horrible. This time last week, I was with friends having an awesome time. 4 days later, I'm bawling my eyes out and it really hasn't stopped all week. Every day this week has been something. Someone telling me that I'm not good enough. I guess I'm just a class A loser, and I need to accept it.

      Tonight was fun! Went to the game against Oakville. I really had fun.. I dunno tonight everyone was in a good mood and it was nice. Kaci was cussing up a storm! Haha 5 in a row! And then she ripped Luke's hoodie on accident. It was pretty funny. I was freaking blushed (more like turned into a tomato) again for no reason! And Goodson was cracking up. SO not funny! Hehe. Haley, I'm not quite sure that this plan worked out so well. *cringe* Hehe it was funny though. ;-) And I'm Snory (rhymes with Story) in the Sleepytime Club! Thanks, Beth! Yeah!  Oh yeah yesterday was a snow day! It was nice, but Charles was home. Ugh. He was sent home because he has pinkeye. It's looking better now. I bet that sucks.   Hm.. well it's 11:30 and I haven't eaten since 6th hour today, so I'm kinda starving. Gotta go get some food..

      Last night was the ND vs. Central game! Wow was that fun! I'd never been to a game vs. Central. Sara and I went home with Allie after school to get ready and stuff. It was crazy and random! Hehe. I got to meet WILL BODE! And make up songs about Sara's man lmao! And Central is oh so low class. I swear they were so ridiculous. Grr..  Today... had a geometry test. It was like all the others -- hard. In English we went to the library and it was really funny haha. I've never laughed so hard in the library. CLAIRE GOODSON ROCKS MY WORLD! Haha. Girl, lunch is going to work next time!! ;-)  We might have a snow day tomorrow! That'd be awesome.. hehe.  Well, Virginia is bitching for the computer, so I guess I have to go.

      Man am I tired. I stayed up till 3 AM again last night haha. And today I went to church and babysat some kids, that's about it.  Well NOBODY could do anything last night. Sara never answered her cell, Sarah was babysitting, Allie couldn't come back to cape, Kaci was babysitting, Claire B. was babysitting, Cort and Lindz had to stay home, and Caro was out with her parents doing stuff. So that was gay. But I am DEFINITELY DOING SOMETHING NEXT WEEKEND, DANGIT!  Yeah and my dad wants me to have a party. Probably because I don't have a social life haha. But yeah, maybe I'll do that during spring break. Living in Sikeston is not fun. That would mean everyone's parents would have to haul ass down here and drop people off. Things will be different when everyone is 16. Mhm.  Well, that's it.

      As if you couldn't already tell, I am entirely obsessed with music.  You know how there are some songs that just make you feel like it is damn good to be alive? They are rare to find. They are those songs that you always remember, and can't stop listening to.  I think I may have found one. Download it. Buy the CD. Listen to it. You will be glad you did.   I have been online for one hour and twelve minutes, according to the AOL timer. This song has been on repeat for one hour and twelve minutes.   "Sunday Morning" by Maroon 5. Enjoy!

Hm.. not many people are on MSN.. so I don't know what to say haha. It's only 1:30 AM... No school Monday! Yes! Spring Fever Reliever Week, thank God! Haha I am just not in a school mood!

We had a fun time though. :-D  Tomorrow... going shopping with Caroline. I have an American Eagle gift card to use, so I'm excited! Hehe. Not much to say here.. I'm happy that I actually went and did something for once! It's great! Hehe.

      Wow.  Last night.. saw  The Passion of the Christ  with my mom. Wow. You MUST see it. Yes, some parts were hard to watch, like the crucifixtion at the end, but WOW. Honestly, I really don't take religion that seriously. I rarely pray. Last night, I got home and prayed for the first time in months. The whole time I was just thinking, "How could they do that to someone and find pleasure in it?" It was a lot to comprehend, and it still is. I definitely recommend seeing it.

      Went to the last game for girls basketball sectionals tonight. We lost by 3 in overtime. That sucked, but tonight was a ton of fun!  Rode the bus again! Emily, Kaci, Sara, Goodson, Squeeb, Matt, and Brett did too. Except Goodson didn't come back on the way home.. LOSER! Haha just kidding girl. Played the legendary Hat game again.. except this time the people were smart and figured it out easily, so it wasn't as good. Except Goodson, she didn't get it. Haaha.   Oh yes, there is something that I want to say. Shit has been going on at school with a friend of mine, and it is really stupid and unnecessary. I should have spoken up and stood up for her at one occassion, and I didn't. Next time, I will. I am not going to sit there and listen to people trash my friends about stuff that they obviously know nothing about. Half of the stuff said was bullshit! That is just something I am clearing up. If you are a friend to me in any way, you better believe that I will stick up for you when you are being trashed.  Just thought I'd let you all know that! Love ya!

      Last night was so much FUN!  Went to the game at Park Hills or somewhere around there. My parents actually let me go! It was great. So I stayed at school until 4:15 when the bus came. Before that, all of us were starving, so Squeeb had a pizza delivered to school! Haha it was hilarious.  So then we go on the bus. That was probably the best part of the trip haha. Me, Claire, Emily, Squeeb, Brett, and Matt all talked and played games and whatnot haha. On the way home we played this game that Squeeb taught us that I SUCKED at! And now I finally figured it out and feel like a retard haha. But it was great. Oh and we won the game 65 - 28. :-D So I'm probably going to go on Saturday.  Today I got my geometry test back and I got an 82%!!!!!!!!!!! YES!!!!!! I am so happy. Hehe. Tomorrow is FRIDAY!!!

      "So much wasted in the afternoon, so much sacred in the month of June, how bout you...."  The acoustic version of "Clarity" by John Mayer = AWESOME.  Hm so today I went to my grandmother's house to finish up the physics extra credit and some other crap my parents felt like bitching about. My computer is a PIECE and is about to die, so I can't even open up Word. So I got that done so they'd be quiet.  So I've just chilled this weekend. That's alright. In a weird way, I don't want school to end. I don't want to be forgotten during the summer. I won't let that hapen. I still want people to call me and ask me to do stuff. I don't want to be one of those "school year" friends...  But yeah.. next weekend is 3 days so I'm thinkin I may have some people over. Not sure yet. The parentals are okay with it. They want to meet my friends or something like that. :-D

      Friday!  Just chilling at home tonight. Everyone has tryouts and meets and whatnot going on. Mom and Virginia are going to see "Cats" tonight in Cape. Dad and Charles are in Baton Rouge. :-D  Speaking of dad, last night he was yelling like a madman about me not doing physics extra credit or doing the scholarship essay. Yeah that was a bunch of BS, since I HAVE been working on them and I turned the scholarship thing in today. He thinks it's due May 1st, so I just let him believe that. Plus, our computer is about to die and you can't even open up Word on it. So how the hell am I supposed to do all this? I've been doing it all at school, which is why he hasn't seen me working on it. So, being the SMART ONE he is, put an AOL timer up on my screen name and didn't tell me what time it's for and went down to Louisiana this morning. So.. genius, I can't work on the physics extra credit! *skies open up* WHAT A BRIGHT IDEA! MAYBE IF WE BLOCK MADELINE OFF HER AOL, SHE CAN'T GET ON TO "TALK TO HER FRIENDS"! BUT DID WE THINK ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DO HOMEWORK? NAH OF COURSE NOT!  The stupidity! It truly amazes me. Virginia has been nice enough to let me get on her screen name to do homework and get on MSN. So HA!  Anywho.. enough of that. Lunch today was just a tad bit embarassing, but I'll live. That was by far the reddest my face has ever gotten! :-S Jack, you're toast.   I'm running for Sophomore Class President! So far it's just me and Ed running. If Abe and Brett sign up then I definitely won't win, but it's all good. I just did it on a whim for the heck of it. So vote for me! Haha.  Hm.. guess that's it!

      So since I couldn't go to the meet and game today ugh.. I stayed at home. It was okay.  I had the house to myself for most of the day. I had to do a bunch of laundry because like I said, mother was upset. So I did that and then since it was so HOT, laid out outside in my swimsuit! I got some sun! A teeny bit burnt actually.. it's nice so I don't look so pasty anymore!  I'm gonna try to get something together tomorrow, don't know what it will be or who with, but at least something! Haha.  XOXO.

But yeah, I can't go to the track meet and baseball game tomorrow. SO PISSED! Grrr..... it's all stupid.   My newest list of CD's that I want.. (It's out of control! haha)  Maroon 5 -  Songs About Jane  Jet -  Get Born   Romy and Michell's High School Reunion  Soundtrack Rooney -  Rooney  Ryan Adams -  Rock 'N' Roll  The OC -  Songs From "The OC" Mix 1   Haha dang!

I promise you, I am ALWAYS here for ANYTHING! *hugs*  Gave my PowerPoint presentation today. I was extremely nervous, and I guess it showed. Kinda sucks when people are rude enough to start laughing and make fun of you... a little thing called class would tell you that openly cracking up is not very nice, and can hurt someone's feelings... yeah.

      I can't believe summer is finally here!!  Got out a week ago, but I just haven't posted lately. Friday I went to Claire's thing at her farm which was a BLAST! (The sacred bluff, s'mores, Old TiMe RoCk 'N RoLl!, it was raunchy and risque but definitely not mono-tonous, hehe)! What an awesome time. Oh yeah, I got 5 inches of my hair cut off! I'm still getting used to it. Today I officially got my job at the country club. Working with Jared, Alex, Grant, Jami, and Mat. I know Jared obviously but have never met the rest of them but they all seemed pretty nice. So come on down to the SCC and buy some food and help with my Buy Madeline a Car Foundation! Haha.  Blogger got a new layout and I like it a lot! Haha. And you can post comments to my posts! So make a comment! :-P  Hm.. that's about it right now.

I went to bed at like, 12:30 which is a record early for me on the weekends and then slept till 2:30!!  I'm just like, burnt out. I can't wait till summer.  So obviously, I'm resting at home tonight. Plus, my parents want me to study and blah blah blah. Whatever.

      Okay, so this has definitely been the best weekened all summer!  Friday - Caroline's party. It was me, Caroline, Emily, Nicole, Shannon, Lindsey, Zach Cap, Stratty, Ryan, and Josh. We swam and ate and it was a lot of fun! And Mom, Virginia, and Charles left for Pt. Clear so I'm just with my dad!  Saturday - Went to Cape with Aunt Rebel. We went to Best Buy and bought CD's (I got The O.C. soudtrack which is really good), saw "The Terminal", and saw Holt's band at Broussard's. They were awesome! Got home around midnight that night.  Sunday - OMG what a BLAST! JP's 16th Birthday party! There were soooo many people there and it was so freakin fun! The police had to tell us to turn the music down haha but it was a blast! Defintely the most fun I've had in a long while. Austin brought us home and then Sarah spent the night which was fun too.  Man, what an AWESOME weekend!

      Tonight.. went to Virginia's art show at the bank! It was very nice. I'm so impressed that my 12 year old sister can paint so well. I'm not kidding. She's phenomenal. She was the featured artist. So yep, I am kinda proud of my lil sis today. Austin was there.. and he wanted to buy one of her paintings!  Tomorrow.. Caroline's party! Looking forward to that because her house is always fun. :-)  Saturday.. mom, Virginia, and Charles are leaving for the beach! I am so excited! A week of just me and my dad. And he's working late now so I'm pretty much to myself for a week. So I'll prolly have some people over. And then Aunt Rebel (yes, that is her name) told me that Holt's band is playing tomorrow and Saturday at Broussard's in Cape so I really want to see him play since I have yet to.  Sunday.. JP's party! Very excited about that. :-D  So my weekend is pretty packed! I'm excited. :-D

      ^^^I   Hm.. so yesterday I babysat the Klostermans. It was fairly easy, just tiresome. They have a pool so we pretty much just swam all day and I got kind of sunburnt, but it's all good. Their dog attacked me though! It was this huge fancy gigantic thing that kept eating my arm.. surprised I still have my arm! I had teeth marks all over me yesterday but they're gone now and I've survived. Today I did my country club thing. Tomorrow I'm off, Thursday I'm country clubbing and Friday babysitting the Klostermans again.  Funny how people promise you they'll call you to do stuff over the summer and you never hear from them..  I'm glad that I have my horses. Riding is my passion and it's always been a refuge for me. Something in this world that I can actually do right. Since it seems nobody has faith in me in anything else.

      Let's see.. what has been going on...  Been working at the club still. I swear, I hate that job SO much, but it's so easy. It's just annoying and really boring. I got last week's paycheck today.. $72 last week for doing pretty much nothing. Filling styrofoam cups with soda and handing towel-wrapped children their Snickers. It's great! Haha.  And then I'm working every day next week pretty much.. Sunday at the club, Monday babysitting for the Klostermans all day, Tuesday at the club, Wednesday off, Thursday at the club, and then Friday babysitting for the Klostermans. Babysitting is from 8 AM - 4 PM and then the club changes every day, but usually mid-afternoon which isn't bad. And no more six hour shifts thank God, because that was just plain MONOTONOUS! (hehe Em, Goodson, Claire)  Hope to go see The Day After Tomorrow on Saturday with some people.. Em and I are organizing it I believe. :-D  Late night summer MSN chats are the best.. hehe.

      Well, yesterday was my first official day of working at the COuntry Club. QUITE interesting let me tell ya. It's easy work, but um.. yeah. Haha.   Today - went to St. Louis to a shoe store and also picked up Charles. Got some cute shoes. Then I went and rode Al this afternoon and didn't go as well as I wanted and I was kinda pissed because his canter is not good at all. He's all tight on his front legs and it's so frustrating because I don't know why he's doing this. He just needs to get back in shape. The whole time I kept thinking of how awesome it would be to be back up at Kim's and actually have him in show condition. And these freaking chickens are always running and squawking all over the ring and it's annoying as heck, and these dudes outside were vaccinating some cattle, which Al absolutely hated because he's never really seen cattle before. But these two old cowboys were there and they looked pretty impressed, so I had fun doing a bunch of fancy leg-yields and changes across the diagonal at the canter hehe. Everyone at this barn rides western and I'm the only english rider there and they were like, "Wow, is that an Arabian??" :-P  Yeah, not much going on here. I have to work on Thursday and Saturday and then I don't know when else after that. I've worked at this place only twice and I already don't like it much. Haha. Oh well.

       Sounds like the barn is definitely doing well at Nationals! I'm so happy for them. I truly am. They've racked up quite a few Top Tens, and 2 Reserve National Champions! Way to go, guys.       Ladies and gentelmen, I read a book. Yes, a novel. And it was quite good.  The Lovely Bones  by Alice Sebold. It took me less than a day to read it. It's pretty sad, but very good in the end.       Tomorrow I have to work 11-3, and then Sarah and I are going to Cape to the mall, being the little fashionistas we are.. hahaha. Going to check out the new Old Navy and all the other good stuff. I have a gift card for some free underwear at Victoria's Secret, and I do love free stuff, so we'll hit there too haha.       Then on Sunday, Dad and I leave for our "Southern College Campus Tour"... hm. This will be interesting - a week on the road with my dad. We're going to see Auburn University, University of Alabama, and Louisiana State University (of course) haha. We'll be back August 8th. So please be sure to call or text me to save me! Haha. The number's 573/258-0934. Lol. This will most likely be my last post until I get home unless I get internet access at a hotel somewhere... so don't miss me too much!! I'll miss you all.. love ya!

       I'll fauking miss you, babe.     &nbsp;  Caro moved today. I really will miss her. Even though we aren't as good of friends as we were in the beginning of the year, I'll miss her. She was one of my first friends from ND.     &nbsp;  She was my first new friend that invited me over and had me spend the night.. Allie, Sarah, Caro, and I went and saw "Uptown Girls"&nbsp;(btw, I still have the ticket stub, sounds dorky, but&nbsp;I put it in my scrapbook next to a pic of the four of&nbsp;us at our first high school dance)..&nbsp;Allie and I got ready and had&nbsp;spaghetti at her house before Activity Week Dance.. and the four of us all had our pictures taken together at Activity Week Dance and at Christmas Dance. So yes, I do have some good memories of our friendship. And I'll never forget Friday night.. fauk! Hehe.     &nbsp;  Thank you, Caro, for the memories. We'll never forget you. *hugs*

       Last night was&nbsp;SOOOO freakin' fun!!!    &nbsp;  I spent the night at Sarah's.. Emily, Chrissy, and Caro all spent the night as well. We ate pizza and stuff and then around 9:30 Huskey aka the molester haha, Anwar, and Kies all came over and stayed till like, 1:30. And we all piled into Huskey's&nbsp;car to go get a movie.. then to Wal-Mart.. then back to the movie store and we ended up getting "Meet the Parents". So we watched it at Sarah's and hung out and stuff and then Kies and Anwar played the guitar and Caro did some freestyle singing which was tooooooo funny!&nbsp;Then after the guys left Sarah ended up falling asleep and the rest of us did prank phone calls which was sooooooooooooo funny!!!!!!!! OMG I haven't laughed so hard in such a long time and that felt really good. "This is Wong Chong Ching from China Palace..." "DON'T FOCK ME OVER!!" "You know how when you smile you get dimples on your cheeks? Well I have those on my ass because I am FAT so don't fock me over!!" LMAO! Holy crap that was hilarious! And then we went to bed around 5:00 A.M. and slept till about 1:00 P.M. and had cinnamon rolls haha. Then I had to go to work at 3:00 which sucked, but no one was there so I just kinda rested. Omg last night was soooo fun!!!! :-D

      I'm sorry if you all read my blog and become madly depressed. I don't mean to bring you down. I just vent.. and it's my blog so I shouldn't care! Haha but I do.  Today I worked 11 - 2. Nice. Then Sarah came when I got off work and we layed out for a while and talked with Riley, Bill, Flaker, and this new guy that moved here named Joey who I thought was pretty cool. And Jenni, Taylor, Madeline, and Meridith were all there too. But we hung out with the guys lol!   But it was good because I really needed to get out of the house.. plus all the paint fumes were giving me a headache. We'll be finished with painting tomorrow! Yeehaw.  And about all the stuff in my previous post... yeah I'm just trying not to think about it because it brings me to tears. I'm not going to call anyone at Nationals until sometime next week when classes start, because I do want to know how everyone is doing and how much butt they're kicking. I'm happy that they're down there, just unhappy that I'm not.  Sara might be able to come to the concer with me! :-D  So.. guess that's it peeps.

       Completely heartbroken.     &nbsp;   Today I knew I should do it otherwise I never would. I got up the courage to call everyone and tell them good luck at Youth Nationals. I SHOULD BE THERE. But I'm not. It's a long and painful story that a few of you already know, but I don't talk about it much.     &nbsp;   Called Caitlin first. Her mom answered. I was okay, I was ready to tell her good luck. "Hey! May I please speak to Caitlin?" "Oh I'm sorry, she's out of town right now, may I take a message"? "Oh hey Debbie.. this is Madeline, I just wanted to tell her good luck.." "Oh well thank you so much for calling! She went down with Kim and Becca and the horses. They're probably there by now. Paul and I are flying out tomorrow." And so on....     &nbsp;   So after that call the tears started coming. I got it together and called Kassidy's cell phone. No one answered. So I left a message. And I lost it. As I babbled on about how I hope they have fun and to kick ass, I just started crying. I couldn't help it and I felt like an idiot. So I hung up.     &nbsp;   I went outside and started painting my desk and chair, the latest project I've been working on. A few hours later, my mom came out with the phone. It was Kassidy and Mandy. I talked to both of them, and they were laughing and having fun and enjoying every bit of Albuqerque. "It just doesn't feel right without you here!" "Well, it doesn't feel right being here." And as I said that I started crying again. I can't stop crying. I am supposed to fucking be there. But I'm not. I went and hung the phone up inside after I was finished talking and my mom asked me if I was okay and how she knows I'd rather be there. Yeah. Sure. I know you damn well know I'd rather be there. And I would've rather been at every damn show this summer than being around this lame ass town. But you're not the one who's heart is broken into a million pieces, so it's all good.     &nbsp;   I was going to go ride Al today, but just looking at my ribbons and trophies and pictures made me bawl more. I'm bawling now. I just couldn't go out there today.     &nbsp;   If you care about me.. that's great. I truly love you for it. Truth is, there are few people that I think genuinely care about me. Most of the people that I know&nbsp;actually care about&nbsp;me&nbsp;come from Kim's barn, and I haven't seen them in a long time. So&nbsp;I just feel great about myself, don't I?&nbsp;It's about time I say it.. I don't like myself at all. I'd never hurt myself... I just dislike myself to the point that I go completely numb and cry alone uncontrollably.     &nbsp;   Do you even know how good it feels for me to say that? I've been wanting to say that for so long. To my true friends - I love you so much. I think about you and pray for you every day. I won't ever stop loving you.     I love horses and showing and riding   so much  . I love&nbsp;them more than life itself. And I want to win National Champion   so badly  . I've come   so damn close   to it and haven't won it. I'm not giving up. No, I'm not finished yet. I'm going to do everything&nbsp;I can to accomplish my dream. No insatiable dumbass is going to take my dreams away from me.     That is all.

      ..you're gonna be the one that saves me, and afterall, you're my wonderwall.." &nbsp; Oasis is awesome! Sure, I'd heard of them before, but after watching "I Love the 90s" and hearing how awesome they were, I decided to check them out on AOL. How awesome! And I found out that "Wonderwall" by Ryan Adams is actually a cover of their song. The Ryan Adams version is beautiful, but the Oasis is way cool. :-D &nbsp; Hm.. today we painted Virginia's room! Next we're doing mine. Buh bye ugly brown paneling.  &nbsp; Tomorrow - working and painting. Fun. Someone please call me and ask to do something!! I'm going insane. Goodson - where in the world are you?! I've called like, 3 times and no one is there. And last night your phone was busy forever! I finally went to bed haha. &nbsp; John Mayer concert next Wednesday.. still don't have anyone to come with me. I hope I can find someone before tickets are sold out, because I would definitely be upset. If not, he'll be in Nashville on August 27th, but still. I want to see him NOW! Haha.  &nbsp; Guess that's it. This it the 8th time I've listened to "Wonderwall" today. Haha.

We ordered pizza and then went to the 9:15 showing of "Spiderman 2" at the lovely Malco Trio. What an AWESOME movie! I seriously loved it. Way better than the first one. I wanna see it again. Totally kick-ass.    &nbsp;  And then we stayed up until 2:30 talking and stuff and then had to get up at 8:30 to get ready to go to church. So I'm pretty tired. But I took a nap because then I had to go to work! Haha.     &nbsp;  And then I talked to Rebecca and turns out she can't go to the John Mayer concert with me.. so seriously if you wanna come tell me because I need someone to come with me. Buy your own ticket, but we'll let ya stay with us haha.    &nbsp;  I love the new "I Love the 90s" shows! Hehehe.     &nbsp;  And another random list since I am bored..    &nbsp;   CDs That I Want     &nbsp;  Ryan Adams - Love is Hell   Dashboard Confessional - A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar   Oasis - (What's the Story) Morning Glory?

Song Memories   No Such Thing by John Mayer reminds me of eating at Quizzno's with Caitlin right before Youth Nationals 2001.  Calling All You Angels by Train reminds me of the California Pizza Company with Caitlin and Debbie and shopping at the Dove mall right before Youth Nationals 2002.

I seriously hate this job SO MUCH. But only another month or so of it and I'm finished.   *I'm going to be taking Driver's Ed. soon. For insurance reasons. It cuts down the cost. So I'm taking it from this old black guy and I think it's going to be fun! I seriously need to learn how to park. Haha.  *Tomorrow Virginia and Charles leave for camp!!!!!! Hell yeah!!!!! This is gonna be great.  *If you want to come to this John Mayer concert with me, tell me. You'll have to buy your own ticket, but I'd be happy to bring you along!!  *That is all.

      Squash, cucumbers, and zucchini. All I intended to do was give Mrs. Reynolds the vegetables from our neighbor's garden and be on my way. They weren't washed, and were in a plastic grocery bag. I was just bringing some vegetables to a lonely old lady who lived in a big house behind ours.   I came to the front porch and rang the doorbell. Her old car was in the driveway but no lights were on, so I figured no one was home. It was very hot outside and it was around dinnertime, so I figured that if she was there, she would most likely be having dinner, or in bed already. The door opened. "Oh, hi, Ms. Toy! I just brought some squash and cucumbers and.." Her face lit up with a joy I cannot explain. "Oh, come on in, honey!" She said.   I walked into a pristine living room with pretty things that were very breakable. She picked up a cordless phone sitting on the chair next to the door. "Oh, Elizabeth honey, I've got company here with all sorts of great vegetables who has come to see me! I'll talk to later." She told me that she had just been "gabbing with one of her girlfriends" and that she'd love for me to come sit down.  We went into the impeccable kitchen and sat down. No lights were turned on in the entire house. It was around 7:00, but the early evening July sun was still streaming in through the kitchen windows. "Now, you're the oldest? Madeline?" she asked. "My, you are just so pretty! I mean, you just have the prettiest face. You certainly have grown into a lovely young lady." I could tell that my visit was really meaning something to her. She immediately began chatting about her latest health ailments and her daughter who lived down the street and all her different medications. After a lowdown on everyone above age 75 in Sikeston's health, she asked me how my family was doing. "Oh, pretty well.. Virginia and Charles are getting ready for Camp and we've just been so busy this summer," I said. "Well that's what you should be: busy," she replied with a smile. "I remember once, maybe three or four years ago, your little brother and his friend were playing in my pebble pile I keep over there by the carport. I keep that pebble pile for my flowers," she said. "And I looked out the window and they were scattering my pebbles. So I went outside and kindly asked them to not play in my pebble pile, and before I had even opened my mouth, that little boy shot off through the gate and into your yard! Oh, it was so funny! I've told so many people that story and I get such a kick out of it every time!" I easily imagined my mischevious little brother shooting through the fence. "Your family is young and y'all should be having all sorts of fun. I remember when my husband was alive, we just loved sitting out on the porch and hearing you kids play in the yard and jump out there on that trampoline. And we loved hearing the Sansagraws across the street in their pool. Reminded us of when our kids were young and we used to go on road trips all over the place." Her eyes were lit with nostalgia.   She told me stories of her husband with heartfelt detail. "Yes, those last thirty-seven days seemed like years," she said while straightening a placemat on the table. "You never know what life is going to throw at you. I guess you can understand that with your grandfather." "So how is your boyfriend doing?" I asked. "Oh, not well at all," she said looking down. "Terminal cancer." My heart broke into a million pieces. Her husband died six years ago from cancer, and now her boyfriend of one year was being stolen away by it as well. "Well, maybe he'll get better," I thought to myself. "We just love each other's company," she said smiling. "Just going to church and eating at each other's houses. And oh we laugh together so much! Last night we were talking on the phone and he was hallucinating from all the morphine he's been getting.." The pieces of my heart broke even more. "And he was saying alll these crazy thing! Oh but they were so funny so I just played along with it. And this morning when he had come to his senses we just laughed and laughed!" "Well that's good, that you are both having fun, especially now," I said. "Oh it sure is. Just enjoy life while you can, darlin'."  She was in the middle of another story when the doorbell rang. "Please let it not be my sister," I prayed in my mind. "Oh look, it's your sister!" she said answering the door. I was sad to leave. I was enjoying listening to her stories and sitting in her pretty home with her new carpet she told me about, and the curtains she sewed herself last winter. But more than anything, I was sad to leave her in that house all by herself. "You girls come visit me anytime!" she said with a cheerful smile. "We certainly will," I replied.   "Were you guys talking the entire time?" my sister asked as we went down the walkway. "Yep, how long was I there?" I asked. "Maybe an hour or so," she replied. "Well, I really enjoyed being with her," I said, blinking into the sun.  And as I cut through the yard to my house, my eyes were filled with tears.

      This was written by my friend Jade, whom I love dearly. Her writing talent is phenomenal and definitely surpasses mine. Almost everything she says here is exactly how I feel, but I didn't know how to say it. Even if I did, I know I couldn't have done it as eloquently as she. It's startling how much of this I feel. The only part that doesn't really apply to me is the actress part, and not remembering you. I  will  remember you. I can guarantee you that. And I do need you to remember me.    The sad thing is, I really have no idea who I am, what I want to be. I write these long posts about what I want, what I desire in life but really, I am so caught in limbo that it’s not even funny. I’m a walking contradiction: the girl who remembers what her teacher was wearing the last day before spring break in second grade, but forgets to empty her trash can; the brutally honest dreamer; the actress who cries genuinely. I can’t even decide what I want for dinner tomorrow, much less decide what I want to spend the rest of my life doing. I want to do something that makes people adore me. I want to do something that makes lots of money. So, I want to be an actress. It just so happens, that I’m good at it. I invest all of myself into who I portray on stage. I get so involved that each time I finish a role, each time I finish a monologue, a little part of me leaves.   I am a wonderer—if that’s a word. I wonder about anything and everything. I sit in my bed, surrounded by pillows and empty cups of tea, and wonder while the world passes me by. I wonder if I’ll even remember that I kept this journal, wonder if I’ll even remember where I’m living right now. Remember how it smells and how it looks and what television shows I watched on empty summer mornings. I wonder if anything will ever be important. I make changes without changing anything. I think without thought. I’m constantly at odds with the world. I envy people who can make concise decisions because I cannot. Long after, I have made my choice; I sit in my bed, surrounded by empty cups of tea and wonder if it made a difference. I am fragile and delicate—or at least that’s what I’d like to believe. Once, someone told me that I was and I thought long and hard after. Once again, I am a thinker who doesn’t think. Nothing ever results from my thoughts.   And I want love. I ache for love. I want someone who loves me dearly and 2.5 kids and a house in Greenwich and the whole shebang. I want a big happy family and an airy kitchen and beautiful, intelligent children who cling to their mother’s leg. I want beauty. I want a face so pretty that it makes people sigh and wrists so fragile that people stare.  I am a walking contradiction, and even though in ten, twenty years, I will not remember you; I need you to remember me.

      Okay, I think my feeling right now is definitely excited!  Here's the conversation.. haha since I have a lot of time on my hands and feel like typing it out in a convo form lol.  Me: So mom, I have this question, and um yeah you know I love you.. hehe Mom: Mkay, so what do you want? Me: Okay well, what would you say if I bought my own ticket, went with a friend, and got dropped off at a concert? Mom: How much? Me: $32 or something like that. Mom: Where? Me: St. Louis. Mom: When? Me: The 28th. Mom: Who? Me: John Mayer. Mom: Oooh he'd be a good one to see. Me: Yep... Mom: So it sounds like you've been talking to someone about this? Me: Well I've researched the ticket, but not the friend yet. Mom: Well I don't see any problem with you going to see him. I'd just drop you guys off and then come pick you up when it was over. I don't know how your father would react to that but we do have to run it by him. Me: Sounds good.. plus we have that Jimi Hendrix thing on him. (LISTEN TO THIS! When my dad was TWELVE his mom dropped him off with a friend at a Jimi Hendrix concert in Memphis! So he better not freak out about this!!) Mom: Yes true, I'll talk to him about it. Me: You're the greatest, Mom. Mom: Yeeah.. haha.

      Jessica Dock rocks my socks! Man what a rhyme!  So.. Monday night I texted Dock about plans for the weekend and she called me and we ended up talking till 2 A.M. It was so great, just a nice convo with one of your best girl friends. And we both came to the conclusion that we both feel the same way on guys right now - confused.   I'm so confused. I've been liking the same guy for, well, a long time, and absolutely nothing has happened between us. Not a freakin' thing. And now I don't know if I like him anymore, but it feels weird to not have a crush on him. It's like, I'm supposed to since I've had it for so long. More or a routine and ritual than based on feeling anymore. And at JP's awesome party, I was like, "dude, there are so many other guys out there that are so awesome, don't stay stuck on the same one!" And so I dunno if I even like anyone right now. It feels weird. I'm sick of having a "crush". I want to  like  someone, as in, they know it and they like me back which could lead to more. I'm so fed up with being single. It's very overrated. In case you haven't noticed, I'm not overpouring with self-esteem, which accounts for a lot of my "crushes". I'm SO TIRED of not being 100% confident of myself.   But yeah... Today I went to Memphis with Mamaw and went shopping, which of course is one of my favorite pastimes haha. Got some cute stuff.. it was a lot of fun! Um.. guess that's it..

      Last night was so fun! We met up with some old frat brother's of my dad's, including the one that is a bajillionaire now. We went to his house first for     tails (no, I wasn't allowed one haha) and then we went to the restaurant. His wife, Sari, was so cool! So chic and fashionable... but with that kind of money it's hard not to be. So we had a great dinner at this really nice steakhouse.. and they served me wine!!! Muhaha. So then Sari was like well where to next?! So we went to this neat martini bar named Duvic's where I had a coke lol. Then finally around midnight we went to the hotel.  This trip was so much fun. I've discovered that my dad was absolutely wild in college haha, and it was all just so much fun. I don't want to leave! But.. I am ready to be back home tonight.  See ya!

      Haha so yesterday we toured the campus of LSU. It's really pretty. Not as pretty as Alabama or Auburn, but I like it. I found out that it isn't Spanish architecture, but "Northern Italian Renaissance." Haha. We met some people from Florida and Colorado who asked us if we ate at Lambert's!! Lol I don't understand why people are so infatuated with that retaurant! :-P  Then after that we went to the LSU Student Union and got tee shirts and stuff like that. Then we went to some nice store because my dad wanted to get some more polo shirts. And in the women's section they had SHOES GALORE! I'm talking tttooonnnnsss of Prada and Manolo Blahnik! Of course that isn't in my budget haha. Then we went back to the hotel and got cleaned up because we were going out to eat with some friends of dad's at the trendy sushi place! So we drove to their house at Lafayette... and WHOA!! I thought the people that we're eating with on Saturday have a nice house, but these people way outdo them. They had these secret passages in the bookcases and a  safe room  and a wine cellar and the house was brand new and really modern with these gorgeous verandas looking out over the river. It was soooo awesome. It was at least 20,000 square feet, no joke. The people who lived in it were friends of dad's. The wife, Martha, was a very good friend of his back in college. And she invited a friend of hers and her daughter to come to dinner with us, and they were very nice. The daughter is on a full scholarship from Wallstreet going to NYU!!! She's obviously very smart. And she was in all black and so hip haha, definitely very New York.  The restaurant, Tsunami, OOOOOMMMMGGG!!! This place was something right off of  Sex and the City!  It was really loud with all this techno music haha, and it was all dimly lit with tons of people packed in there. And it had this balcony lit with all these white Christmas lights. We sat in this booth thing where part of it was a booth and then chairs were on the other side and the booth part was really comfy and high-backed.  So first we get our drinks and stuff, and then we ordered sushi as an appetizer. I got some Sunset Rolls which were absolutley delicious! And they don't give you metal utensils. They give you chopsticks! So after Martha (who was just so sweet and hip) showed me how to use them I was a pro by the end of the evening! Hehe. Then after we had sushi they brought out salads and soups because I guess they're just supposed to. Even the salad looked cool. The soup was okay because I really don't like soup so I didn't eat it. But the salad was nice. Then they brought our entrees. I had shrimp teriyaki, and let me tell you, it was DIVINE! Ahhh.  And then Martha's husband, Pat, kept ordering bottles of wine lol, and one of our waiters thought I was 21 so he asked me if I wanted some so I was like SURE! Haha so I actually drank wine in a retaurant! I felt so cool haha. I'm such a nerd. :-P And the waiters were all really young and really cool, and the chefs were all these Japanese dudes who every now and then would get in a huddle and say some cheer and then take shots! Haha.  I was wearing a black open neck short sleeved shirt, with this knee length 40s looking skirt that's yellow with big white flowers and white ribbon at the bottom. And I wore my white leather stilettos with my white purse! Haha I truly felt glamorous.  Oh, what a mahvelous evening!!!!!

      Greetings from.... Louisiana!  Haha well what do you know, we're staying at a hotel in the same chain as the last one, only it is a whole lot nicer! And obviously, they have a free computer! Hahaha. We got here around 3:00 this afternoon and drove around a bit and saw some sorority houses and stuff. And my dad's old frat house. The campus of LSU is pretty, all in Spanish architecture with palm trees and stuff. I like it. Tomorrow we're gettnig a tour at 10:00. Then after that around 7:00 we're meeting some old friends of my dad's and we're going to this really modern and cool sushi restaurant! I'm pretty excited because I love sushi. Then Friday we're going out to eat with some other dudes, and Saturday is what I'm excited about because we're going to some really nice retaurant with this mucho rich friends of my dad's that he went to college with. I'm talking like, millionaires. Seriously. We went to their house last year when we came down here for the LSU/Florida game, and WHOA. I really don't mean to sound rude, but if you saw the house you'd understand haha. It will be interesting. But yeah, I think this trip is turning out to be pretty fun! I didn't think it would be but I'm having a nice time. :-D I wrote Goodson a very lovely e-mail telling her where I was hehe. :-P The home of the one and only, LSU TIGERS! Haha.  Thanks for the text messages! They make me happy hehe. Well, I better go because it looks like some dude wants to get on here and he's looking pretty     ed! Bye!!

      Greetings from Alabama!  So Dad and I left on Sunday and got to Auburn that evening and stayed at a  really  nice hotel. It was fun. Downtown Auburn is absolutely adorable, with all these cute cafes and awesome little boutiques. The next day we saw Auburn the college, and the campus was gorgeous, although somewhat small. Then that night we left for Tuscaloosa and we're still here, and I'm posting from the hotel's free computer hehe. Today we went and saw the University of Alabama, and I am VERY impressed. It is an awesome university. I am seriously considering this place. The campus is huge and state of the art and all this new construction is going on. The sororiety houses are beautiful. Tomorrow we're leaving for Baton Rouge, LA and then we'll see LSU on Thursday and then spend a few days down there. I'll be back on the 8th. Have a great time, don't get into too much trouble, and don't miss me too much! Hahaha. See ya peeps.
