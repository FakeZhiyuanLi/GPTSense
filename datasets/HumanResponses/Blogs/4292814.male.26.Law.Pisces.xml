      I watched the Major League debut of Scott Kazmir last night and I must say that any 20 year old lefty that can consistently throw 97 MPH should not have been traded for Victor Zambrano, damaged goods who will still lead the American League in walks, even though he joined the National League in July.  Kazmir looked a little wild - he had great velocity, and was able to hit the inside part of the plate to strike some hitters out but at times couldn't find the strike zone, and proceeded to walk too many hitters for me. Add that to repeatedly falling behind hitters, and he finished up 5 innings on 101 pitches and got his first major league win.  Not bad for a pitcher the Mets weren't going to call up to the majors for another 2 years...  How did the Mets do? Well, they started Aaron Heilman, last year's "Scott Kazmir", who went to on to lose nine straight major league decisions, and didn't even make it out of the 4th inning. Sometimes, I just want to bang my head against the wall when the Mets continue to make terrible decisions, such as this one.  I also learned that it is a lot easier and cheaper than I previously thought to download movies off the Internet. It's nice to have a roommate that knows what he is doing on the computer. I can't wait to watch Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle!  Sometimes, I wonder why I even bother. The old saying is that if you want different results, you should try a different approach (or something like that). I have never been the type of person to run away from my problems, so yesterday I attempted to reach out to someone who has been angry with me, so that we may resolve our differences amicably. Did it work? I don't think so...in fact, it may have fanned the anger to an new level, making me think that it was a bad idea to try in the first place. It's frustrating for me when people fail to acknowledge that someone else is attempting to fix something, especially when the easy way out would be to do nothing and let hostilities remain. Who knows where this is going. We'll see what happens today.

      I cried last night for the first time in awhile. I used to cry a lot but I have been much better lately. It's so weird how the most obscure things can set you off sometimes. This is probably gonna sound bizarre but I was watching Chasing Amy and right after it ended, the last scene really hit me. I don't know if I was just really tired or what, but I felt like I could really relate to Holden in the movie.  I thought about some of the relationships I have had, and how it seemed to me that everything was going really well, and then I did or said something really stupid, and the relationship was permanently changes for the worse. I thought about why it seems I always have difficulties with close relationships. I have not yet figured out if I am the type of person that likes to build walls and not let people in, or if I like to let people in, and don't know how to handle it because it is very difficult for me to share some of my most innermost thoughts.  This blog barely scratches the service and there is a lot more to me than I could or feel I should post here (at least for now). Some things are just meant for my eyes and thoughts only. I did figure out last night after I calmed down that happiness is like a very addicting drug. Once you have it, you constantly want more of it, it gives you a very strong high, and once you lose it, you will pay any cost, literally and figuratively, to get more of it.  I am also mad at myself that on Saturday, I decided that I should go to the Cadet office, while no one was even there, when I should have spent the time more wisely and went to visit my mom. It has been awhile and I think going to Elmont would make me feel a lot better about a few things. I also think that, despite being extremely mad at my grandfather for a lot of reasons, he is one of the few living relatives I have left, and I should attempt to reconcile some of the problems I have with him. I think in December, when I go visit Scott, I should take a day and see what I can accomplish. At least, it's a start.  Well, time to start the week.

      Good times last night with some of my boys...Spud and Greg made it out and we ended up getting together at Oddfellows near the train station...I have walked by there many times but have never gone in.  The bouncer (or whatever you want to call the dumbass checking ID's) was a dick all night...He gave my license a long staredown and than proceeded to do the same thing with Spud's...I don't know how anyone can honestly say we look under 21 but I guess that's his job.  Later on, he yelled at Greg for sitting on a pool table that no one was using too...the things you have to put up with to have a good time these days.  Oddfellows was pretty empty for a Saturday night and they did play pretty annoying 80's music all night (I think Warrant and Guns N Roses are beyond played out at this point), but they do have Sam Adams Summer Ale and pool tables so naturally Greg loves the place. I really wish I was a better pool player and maybe one day I will be, but it's really frustrating to get your ass kicked everytime you play (by a girl too, no less - Petra wasn't bad either)...especially, when you know the shots are makeable, so I'll definitely have to practice up in the future...  It was good to see Spud and Greg. We always seem to have a good time and than promise to make it out more often but it rarely happens. Chris never made it out (he said it was raining hard in Brooklyn so he couldn't make it to Jersey - what a bullshitter) but will supposedly visit today...we'll see how that one turns out.  The kid makes me laugh non-stop whenever we talk so it's hard to stay mad at him for an extended period of time...  I think I'm gonna get some sushi at Robongi later and go to bed early. Definitely not looking forward to going back to work tomorrow but I really don't have any choice. The weather is gorgeous today so maybe I'll chill on the balcony while I still can. Enjoy the rest of your weekend people!

      There's nothing more appealing to me than getting comfortable on the couch on a Saturday afternoon and taking in a good baseball game. Right now I'm tolerating the Yankees game until 4 when the Mets come on (they start later due to playing in San Francisco)...  340 Grill is one of the best restaurants I have been to in Hoboken so far. I highly recommend it for those that enjoy fish. The monkfish was excellent. It came with seasoned spinach, roasted red peppers and matchstick potatoes...I had a glass of Fonseca Port after dinner and it was strong and tasty...I started to get into wine last year when I attended my friend Jack's wedding at a winery in South Jersey...Since then, I have been attempting to learn the different qualities and varieties of wine, and there is a lot more to it than I originally thought...  The restaurant is on Sinatra Drive right on the water with a great view of Manhattan and there is a public park there where some people were congregating and enjoying the weather.  It looks like it's about to start pouring rain so I am regretting that I didn't get to play some tennis today but at least I found out where the Hoboken courts are...hopefully it will be nice tomorrow and I will be able to convince someone (ANYONE!) to make the trip back (the courts were on 10th near the high school).  This morning I took a trip to the Cadet office in Bergenfield to help them pack up the trucks on their move to Allentown. Both George and someone else at the office said that they would be there between 8 and 1 today, but when I got there at 8:45 it was deserted, minus one of the Cadet trailers in the parking lot in the back...I waited until 10 and than got really mad and left. I really don't understand why no one was there nor why there were no attempts to relay if they had finished packing up early (since they were doing it since Thursday) but whatever...It's kind of weird that after 70 years in Bergen County (the past 11 in Bergenfield), the Cadets are moving to Allentown.  After the debacle in Bergenfield, I went to the Riverside Square Mall in Hackensack to get my keychain fixed, but the person that does the repairs was out so I'll wait until I get a chance to go to the flagship store in Midtown...  My friend Spud is heading up north today for the fantasy football draft at Willie McBride's...personally, I don't understand why or how any human being can get so emotionally and financially vested in running a fantasy team, but it is a pretty popular activity...  Well the Angels are giving the Yankees a good beating so I am thoroughly enjoying a day of sports and no work. Tonight, Greg, my friend Chris from Revlon, and who knows who else might be coming out so we'll see what happens...the weather has turned from threatening to almost hurricane-like...man August weather is weird...alright folks, enjoy your Saturday...someone pass me the bowl and a beer!

      So it's Friday around 4:30 and I'm staring at the clock waiting to get out of this anal-retentive, pain-in-the-ass-but-unfortunately-very-financially-necessary experience I call a job. I think my boss (Christine) is out again today because I haven't had one phone call or email from her today (not that I would go to her office to check if she is here)...I guess I should get used to this type of day, considering she will be out for several weeks on maternity leave soon...  And, the woman that usually sits near me (Sheryl) broke her foot walking her dog (I have no idea exactly how she accomplished that feat), so it was her fault, but I actually feel pretty bad about it because she's really nice and she has been talking non-stop about going to Italy to see her son for 3 weeks who is stationed there in the Army (presumably, there will be a lot of walking involved)...  But alas...I've been reading many blogs lately and figured why not try my hand at it myself. I hope to share some of my thoughts, rants, and insights here (hence the title) for those of you that may or may not know me...  I will try my best not to offend anyone, their views, or opinions, but if I do, I apologize in advance and hope it doesn't discourage you from reading and commenting in the future...  Oh yeah, all comments are welcome, regardless of how ridiculous you or I may find them, and I will do my best (not making any promises here) to respond to all of them.  Well, that's about it. I am off to try the monkfish at 340 Grill tonight...I heard it tastes like lobster. We'll see how that turns out. Don't know when I'll be blogging again so enjoy my first time and flame away!!  :)
