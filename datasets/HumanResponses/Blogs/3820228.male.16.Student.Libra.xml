      I don't know you guys! I's definitly just time to go. I mean, I can't even talk to Bill anymore without  wondering who this kid is. It feels like me and him... well, it feels like it was a dream because I havn't seen him for so long. Today I was talking w/him and he brought up something and we kinda blew up at eachother. Look what this trip is doing to me, but more importantly, the "us". I can't recall the the last time that I hugged him or how it felt but I have a picture of him in my head that is seen clearly. I was at a stop light and he went right infront of me. I cried so hard on that trip home, It was just hitting me that I wouldn't see him for that long! I arrived home and was glad to see my mom home because I ran into her arms and received and much needed hug. I think it was the first time I hugged my mom in awhile. It just goes to show that no matter what, moms really are there for you and I appriciate that. I can't remember the first time I talked to Bill because at that time I was talking to probably nine or ten people that I kinda liked at that time. I can however remember the first time I saw him in person, there he was sitting so patiently for me. I love that kid and... I dunno, I speechless (and crying) right now....     ok         gimme a second          Ok, yeah I just need to get home, get back into the swing of things. I think this trip is putting me through alot of stress and everything good and bad. I never cried harder the nights leading up to my leaving. I hope he knows that I love him! I think I should have to bow down to him and do what ever, he's to great of a thing in my life and I should treat him that way. But really... Oh my gosh! way to get off topic martin! Ugh, I'm gonna go to sleep now! g'nite peeps!!

      Today was such an awesome day! Much Better than I thought it was going to be! I went to "Blues Fest 04" that was taking place in Portland today and just being around good and fun people was enough. It was was my first time that I was flirted with (by a guy;) His smile was the cutest feature. Then, soon after that, I was walking the other way now and I caught this shirt-less, muscle man wearing a cowboy hat and an hot tan! Ugh, I love being in a big city!! Ya don't get this in Bay City! People that are gay in Michigan are either flamers or just plain ugly (well, the ones in my city). I gotta hand it to Michigan though, there are some hot mo-fo-ers here (Like my guy:) ...OH, and I was standing in the crowds minding my own buisness and all the sudden I get beer spilt on my leg! I look down and all I see is this older dude lying on the ground. Then I look back and notice that the older dude fell because these two chicks tripped and fell over the damn guy! I look down at the girls to make sure they're all right and they were laughing then turned and started macking right there!! It's just that it was done so... randomly! I couldn't belive this all happened in like seconds! sheesh! It was fun, then I actually had a cute guy walk up to me and started talking to me but my dad was right there! The one time that he is (ofcourse) Ugh! Anyways, I'm out! Later Bro!... and you too.

      Today was more eventful that normal. My grand-rents actually wanted to do something rather than sit around my dad's place all day! First, we went to Fred Meyer and I tried on these really slick pair of skateboard shoes by "NSS Preformance". I don't know how to skateboard but these were tight! They looked hella-good on me too! :) Mmm, what else? Ooo, there was Starbucks! the last Starbucks I was in, was in New York City back in April. Yuuup! Got the "Strawberry&Creme" Frap(Veinti size) w/whipped creme atop! Mmm, OH and there are some hot sales happening at Old Navy and Gap! I just got a HOT pair of boxers from the Gap though (arn't ya proud of me?!) Yeah, then I am going to a "Blue, Brews and Barbques" festival on the Willamette river in Portland. It should be a good time. Next Sunday, I'm going back heading back home (2 weeks earier than expected) but I'm not gonna tell anyone this news so I can suprise them. It will be six weeks that I was gone rather than eight weeks. Ehh, I miss some people there. This is a good chance to come back an improved person! I think I'll do that. Not judging everyone even if they'll find out or not and such... Yeah, that's the plan. (Not to mention, coming back a tanner man!)

      I dunno, I just seem to have this problem with being in a rather large city and not being out with freinds. I'm from Michigan, visting my father here in Portland and I bet there are some good hang-out spots here! I wanna just take my grandpa's keys there on the table and be off for the night!... My dad is too much of a light sleeper. He'll find me gone and you'll find me dead! Heh heh, that was funny! :) Oh, if ya wanna see some pics of me click  urlLink here ! Ugh, I'm feeling different emotions right now. I know that I want to get back to Michigan and see Bill but everyone else except for a few selected, I don't care about. Above all though, If Bill wasn't there, I would finish me two remaining years here without a doubt!

      I was down at the pool just as the sun was going down today and I went into the hot tub. There he was, the guy that was always giving me this look that said "Hey, your pretty cute". Well, I'm not sure if I know how to give that one but I was wondering if I did when he followed me into the hot tub. Then I got to thinking how BAD that would be if my dad walked over to check up on me if I started doing any kind of flirting. Ugh, not only that but I have a boyfrind back in michigan who loves me! I don't know what to do with these young hormones of mine sometimes. I love Bill too though and I wouldn't do anything anyways. But, sure enough, my dad came stollin' in! Ehh, it's alright!
