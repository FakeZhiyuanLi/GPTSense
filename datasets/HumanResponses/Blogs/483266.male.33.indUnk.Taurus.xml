      Well, another year ticks on and I make it to 33! WOW - Where has the last year gone ?  I know that the last 48 hours for me has been quite full on ! Started on Friday with my birthday - It was nice, thanks Tina and co :-) A nice easy transition into 33.  Saturday was then another memorable day. Why ? Well it was my leaving do from my current work place. A nice evening with friends from the ward at Gino's Italian pizza restaurant.  Thanks to: Nikki, Mandy, Karen, Marie, Mary, Helen, Margs, Tracey, Lisa and Wayne all for coming - and thanks to everyone else on the ward for their time, support and encouragement - Cheers :-)  Sunday was then a lovely day out to the sun and a trip to the Torquay region of Devon. Was so nice, thought I would include some photos taken on the day:    The village of Cockington    Brixham Harbour - 1    Brixham Harbour - 2  What a lovely day out - TOP. Went with my Mum and wife :-)  Then onto today !! First day of my new job.  An induction week which kicked off with the annual drug update :-/  And that was my weekend :-)

      Well, my new job is looming on Monday, and far be it from me to not make an effort. As my hair was getting rather long, I decided it was time for a crop.  The last two hair dressers have closed since I started visiting them (not sure if there is a connection there) so I tracked down a new one to try.  Whilst sat in the chair, I thought - what the hell!! Lets get radical. My old friend Mr Rudd always has his cropped and chopped, so I thought I would give it a go. The hair dresser then informed me that you can now get a grade 8 trimmer which was quite popular in today's trends.  So I went for it: Grade 8 all over the top and grade 3-4 at the back. You judge for yourself.    Before    After

      Anyone that owns an XBOX and knows a little bit about the current E3 computer fair will be as excited as I am about the new Halo 2 Multiplayer video available to watch.     Not seen it? Trust me, it's AWESOME !

      After rushing across Exeter in the mad rush hour traffic, I finally made it to the Odeon to go watch The Day After Tomorrow.  Bugger !  Sold out - So next on the list was the latest Harry Potter movie, the one where someone escapes from a prison.  I'm not sure if it was because I was looking forward to the other movie but to be honest, I found the movie kinda boring !  It didn't really grab my attention, and seemed really blank and drawn out in places. There are some nice special effects, especially I thought the moving tree and the horse come chicken come bird creature.  None the less, there was nothing ground breaking just more of the same but done better.  Still, at least I have TDAT to look forward to still :-)

      For me, someone who can't help but take things apart, it was only a matter of time before my XBOX got taken apart. Now I've done it I'm even more excited than before. The potential is huge !!  That little buty could be re-built into anything - only my imagination is the limit !!     Compact little bugger ain't she ?      Why! It's a PC in a box, crying to be modded !   I'll post any pics of final systems.
