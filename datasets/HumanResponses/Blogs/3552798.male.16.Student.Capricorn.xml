      I think he hates it when i call him that...but he'll get over it because i love him! I can't believe that we still havent run out of things to talk about! we talk forever and i love it. whenever i talk to him i feel so relaxed too. i feel like i can tell him anything and everything and dont have any doubts about it. thats the first time with anybody ive felt this way. even though there is stuff im sworn to secrecy i can't tell him about (if you tell me something you wanna be kept secret...i ALWAYS follow through on that) i wish i could tell. but i know that we will be together enough that he may beable to find out some of the stuff later. i love him soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo incredibly much! i dont think i can say it enough. i stayed on the phone with him for 45 minutes after he fell asleep and just quitely talked to him in his sleep. i feel so comfortable around him. i want to be with him forever. and i hope i can. but i guess ill shut up about him for at least 2 minutes :-). lets see here...today im picking up my parts to repair my car! then i can drive out to see my Joe! oops i was supposed to shut up lol. and my dad called me today, so im gonna be takin my car over there pretty soon, probably next week and fix it, then im going white water rafting. that should be fun. im gonna take Doug and my cousin Brandie along too probably. The summer has been going by pretty well after....you know lol...if you dont it starts with me meeting someone with the letter J. ;-) and also my friends have been comming over a lot. Last night i played 7 rounds of Jeoprady Junior Eddition on NES with Melissa. we're pretty good at it lol, and everything was before we were born!. i kicked ass though. i won every game :-). i love spending time with her. shes always fun. she also brough over a coloring book lol. good times. and i finally talked to Aaron last night too! he got back from his trip. i guess he didnt have any text messaging so i couldnt get ahold of him. sounds like he had fun though. and i almost freaked out too. he said his bf made him cry. i thought he hurt him, but lucky for him it wasnt way too big of a deal. i would do just about anything for that kid! but anyways i guess thats all i have to say. love you joe, aaron, and jake! and of course everyone else who reads this! peace

      My little cousin almost died on Saturday. Heres the article: 4-year-old says he jumped 'like a superhero'  A 4-year-old would-be superhero escaped serious injury Saturday after he jumped from a second-story window at his family's north Spokane apartment building.  The boy, who was not identified by police, lives with his mother in the 600 block of north Oak. Police said the child jumped through an open, unscreened window and landed on grass below, narrowly missing a patch of concrete and a barbecue. Police Supervisonr Sgt. Marc Wheelwright said the fall could have killed the boy had he landed in the wrong spot. The boy told nurses he jumped through an open window "like a superhero," according to Spokane Police. Officers said his mother and her boyfriend were asleep at the time, around 2 p.m. The window had been propped open by a stick, according to a police report. Police said the sill was about 2 feet from the floor. After being taken to the hospital, the boy was given a CT scan which showed no head injuries. He spent Saturday night in the hospital for observation and was listed in satisfactory condition.  Way to go Chrystal! next time close your fuckin windows if your not going to be there! you scared the hell out of all of us, im so glad hes alright tho, VERY close call.

      OK so you are all probably wondering 'who the hell is this Cameron kid?' if you read my last blog. Well im gonna tell you :-) ok hes this kid who instant messaged me one day on Yahoo. We talked every single day for at least 5-6 hours every night and then we talked on the phone a lil bit too. well we finally decided to meet. the day he came over to meet me i got hit by a car so i was havin a bad day but all that went away when i saw him. i was so excited to meet him. anyways we hung out a lil bit that day then he had to go to work. then the next day he came over and spent the night kinda, he had to leave early tho cuz he had to work at the Lilac parade (he was a crowd control person...he works for the SPD) so we watched movies pretty much all night, and he cuddled up next to me, and like 5 minutes later we started making out. this was my first time ever doing this with a guy. or anybody to tell you the truth. and it went a bit further but im not gonna talk about that. anyways after that i started to fall in love with him. and then the day after i pretty much asked him out, he asked me if i wanted to see his new boyfriend. i was so depressed! and he didnt even care. then he started bein a real asshole to me. I guess getting hit by that car the day i met him shoulda been a sign :-p. then he wouldnt even tell me when his graduation was, and we dont talk anymorel. which im fine with now. only time he ever IMs me is to see if he can have my laptop. i wish i never met him. i luv you Jake thanks for helping me through that! i dont know what id do without you... remember im always here for you too. but anyways thats what happened with Cameron. thanks for reading. check back later for more :-)
