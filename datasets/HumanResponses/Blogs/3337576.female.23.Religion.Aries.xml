      I wake up in the morning to dogs whining and barking.  Playful sounds of the animals are anything but soothing to me as I climb out of bed.  I'm almost angry that the sun rose again.  I open the baby gate and let the dogs out of the bedroom and then outside.  I would rather be in bed.    Joe is up, but he doesn't really bother with the dogs.  Assumes I'll do it, and a good assumption because I always do.  Yeah, I love those animals.  Their soft tongues waking me up and butts shaking to wag those tails to tell me hello.  It's more than wonderful to be loved by a dog.  Mornings though, back to that.  Take out dogs, say bye to Joe, start to work.  Check email first, respond to those that need attention, read those that don't.  Same mundane life that it's always been.  Could I have anything I ever wanted, it'd be to ENJOY life.  I've always wondered what exactly is the secret of those who really enjoy living.  Everything about it seems to make them smile or set their heart to beating that happy beat instead of the everyday boring thump thump thump.    I have God, that's not it.  And yet I have a hard time with the verse, "I came to give you life and Life more abundantly."  I see nothing abundant about my life.  Oh sure, some days I can see it.  Some days the wind in my face is enough to make me smile.  Some days I'm happy to be walking.  Most days -- those days I think about, dwell on -- I am angry at the sun for rising and angry at my heart for beating.  Suicide?  Nah.  That's not my thought.  Just that I don't want to get out of bed and live.  I know, it's contradictory really, but nonetheless how I feel.    Today hasn't been a good day overall.  Though I did talk to my friend this morning, and that made me smile.  I haven't talked to her in a while... not really talked.  We're starting to lose touch.  I'm starting to lose touch with them all.  My life has become mundane and I am a wife.  Simply a wife.  No longer friend, lover, confidant.  Those are all supposed to be balled up into one, but the word wife... it doesn't do it for me.  I need something more.  I need to be more.  I need to live MORE.  It seems though, that I'm all talk.  I talk about wanting to live more and never do it.  But then I'm a wife and I can't.  I have to think about Joe and what my LIVING would mean for his life.  He is before me.  Always has been.  Whatever he wants.  Whatever he needs.  Then me.  Buy food he likes and put back the food I like.  Buy him shoes and put away the sandals I want.  Let him have his Buicks and put the idea that I might have a hobby on the back burner.  No it isn't his idea, it's mine and I've let it or maybe even caused it to happen, but it doesn't change the fact that I want to LIVE more.  So what is living more?    Driving to the beach and sleeping in the car to watch the sun rise the next morning.  Quitting my job and getting another job at a bigger church where I have an expense account and an office and volunteers who LIKE to volunteer.  Leading a camp where kids can come and KNOW Jesus and KNOW Him more fully that is organized and somewhere people want to send their youth.  Holding a baby that is mine.  Raising that child to know God and love Him and love LIFE and everything about it.  Writing a book that people enjoy reading and recommend to their friends and sells copies out in stores.  Cutting flowers out of my flower bed where there are no weeds to pull and putting them in the beautiful vase in the center of my beautiful table in the middle of my beautiful kitchen.    Perhaps I need to learn to be happy with what I have before I can have what I want.

      I got in my first real fight with my preacher yesterday.  A lack of communication and poorly handled situation on his part led to a total breakdown on both our parts which led to raised voices, tears, and hurt feelings.    Preachers are supposed to be up on this pedestal from which they do no wrong, make no mistakes, etc.  Well, at least that's how much of the world sees it.  I tend to really disagree.  Everyone makes mistakes and he made one yesterday.    The situation: The youth group had a yard sale on May 8th (it was supposed to be May 1st, but someone scheduled the Family Life Center that day and caused us to have to move it at the last minute).  The youth were there from about 5:30 in the morning until 2 in the afternoon.  They worked hard, may I add, and did a VERY good job.  So, I let them leave without putting away all the leftover items.  There were A LOT of leftovers.  We did not have church in the evening of May 9th due to Mother's Day.  So, my plans were to take down the leftover items throughout the next week in the mornings (since I have a full-time 1-9:30pm daily job).  Monday - Wednesday I had unexpected appointments arise and on Thursday it was raining and quite honestly, I didn't want to get out in the rain.  Now, granted, I had told the preacher that I'd be there all week, but the fact was I didn't see it as a big deal because no one had reserved the FLC for the next week.  I had two weeks to clean it up as I saw it.  I did go over on Friday to work on it, however, upon arriving, I found it done.  Everything was put away.  So I smile and think, "Wow, what a nice pastor to get some people to help me out because he knows how busy I am."  Whoa, what a poor thought that was!  My pastor drives up in his Jeep with the trailer attached.  First sign something is awry.  His wife jumps out of the passenger seat signaling to me that her husband is mad.  Second sign.  He gets out of the car, walks a couple of steps to about 4 feet from me, crosses his arms and takes a defiant stance.  Third sign.  So I've already kinda prepared myself before he even started his rant.  I ask, "Did you do all that," with a smile on my face mind you.  him - "Yes." me - "Why?" him - "Because it wasn't getting done." me - "I came to do it today." him - "You didn't tell me that.  You told me you'd be here all week." me - "I didn't think it was that big of a deal." by this time, no more smile. him - "It is.  The ladies wanted to set up for the Senior Breakfast today, but I had to tell them they couldn't." me - "I didn't know about that." him - "I called you last night and you didn't return my calls." me - "Because I didn't get home until 10:30 last night.  I'm not calling you that late!" him - "Then you should've called me this morning." me - I was on my way over here this morning."  And so it continued.  It came to the point where he brought up the fact that I "chose" to work another job after I "already had a job at the church."    me - "I wouldn't HAVE to have another job if you paid me enough.  But I have to eat! I had no choice."  He continually said I should have called him and let him know what was going on.  I really didn't think about it.  I really didn't think it would be an issue and I didn't know about the Senior Breakfast because they DIDN'T PUT IT ON THE CALENDAR!  How am I supposed to know what he wants when he doesn't tell me!  I really wanted to quit.  To just up and say BYE.  But I'm one of those that preaches, wait a day, then a few days then if you still want to quit, do it.  So, I'm waiting a few days.  I am more rational now and realize that I probably would've been mad at me too if I were him.  But I still think he handled the situation poorly.    Comments are welcome.

      So I got my Mikey's Funny this morning.  It's an email humor list through Youth Specialties.  Mikey sends out an email to say YS is restructuring and he's been laid off.  He was very gracious to YS, saying he had loved his job and appreciated the 12 years he'd worked for them.    Really, that just stinks.  Mikey's Funnies was a great contribution, and I'm sure Mikey was too.  But restructuring is restructuring right?    The answer should be WRONG!  How many of us have give 12 years or more of our lives to a job and then been laid off without anywhere to go?  I doubt YS is this way, but in corporate america it has become the norm to lay off people who have been there too long and who the company has to pay too much to do the same job.  It's not cool.  They bring in the young people who haven't lived long enough or worked long enough to know how to properly run the business simply because the cost less.  It really isn't fair, is it?    Mikey, Godspeed.  My prayers are with you, and I know you'll land on your feet and continue running long after this.

      So I started a blog.  Yep.  We'll see how long that lasts. LOL... but really.  I'd like to update this often and keep up with it.  Maybe I'll even start posting stuff on here for my youth to read or something.  I'm at work and bored, which is I'm sure when I'll be writing the most.  Anyone ever wonder why it is we get jobs that bore us?  I mean, I'm a youth minster, but that didn't pay the bills completely so now I work here too.  Fun, but boring too.  Youth ministry, now THERE is a job.  Work hard... all the time... to be underappreciated... and loving every minute of it.  But my church is good.  They appreciate me.  They love me, but I know I won't be there forever.  We'll see.  Time to do a bit of work.  Post more later.
