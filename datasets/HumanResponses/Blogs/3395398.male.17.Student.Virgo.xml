       Today, I talked to the Walkie Talkie When i am alone,  When i can't find anyone to talk to When the world left me alone, sighing When it began to rain When i feel lonely When desperation hits me hard When the time, i need to hide my feeling When there is nobody listen to me When i feel sad I talked to the walkie talkie.  My words, My thoughts, My feelings, My unhappiness, My sadness, are sent out with the radio signal. Sent to unknown places, or maybe they are all sent to thin air. Did you hear me? I guess not. They all gone into the thin air.  No matter how long i talked to the walkie talkie. It will forever be dumb. It will only listen but never understand.  When i talked about myseld so much Did you hear me? Did you understand me? I hope it is a "yes" but i know it is a "no"  Another rainy day, i hold my tears and it shed for me. i stand in the rain, nobody can see, i am crying.  Can you hear what I said? I hope so.

      Everything has its own speed, its own course, its own way. We cannot make it moce too fast. Things may seem to be getting better at a faster speed, but the faster you go, the eassier you may fall.  Just recently heard of a story, it's about a relationship of these two people. Everyone believe that they are the perfect match, they had only met for two or three month. The fondness has grown in both of their heart. And they got into a relationship.   Everything seems so perfect, everything goes on so fine. Everyone believe that they will never be apart. However, apart from this perfection, nobody, even themselves, realise that they are moving along in a very fast speed. They are climbing the stairs of love in a fast speed, maybe is the boy, who pull the girl up too fast.   The boy is a very serious about relationship and this is his first time got into a relationship. It became part of his life. Affecting his emotion, his thoughts and his everything, love makes this strong willed boy cried. The girl, a cheerful girl, the love bring her out of her carefree life which full of freedom, a man step into her life, whatever she does, she got to think how would he feel and think. The happy teenage girl's life is nowhere to be found.  Maybe it is because of the seriousness of the boy make her feel uncomfortable, maybe it is the restriction which the girl feels. One day, she told one her friend that, she doesn't feel good with his presence and she is regretting to get into a relationship because she doesn't know him well enough and with the past few months of being with him, she felt that this man is not the one suitable for her, though he is very good.  Cause and result? Things are going on too fast. The pressure that the boy impose on the girl is too intense, like "having dinner with the his father". Though I believe there is no natural perfect match in the world, the perfect match only form after years of understanding of each other. Time is the factot for everthing, everything happens in its own duration, we all need the patience to wait.  ..................................................................................................................  Yesterday is the Catholic High Music Award, Justin, with any doubt won the Best Solo Performance and the Best Performance of the Night!   And i saw her again, after last year September, was not looking forward to see her anymore since last year September, but i saw her again. It is not fate that let me see her again, I believe it is not. Fate decide that we are not gonna be together for long and we are not meant for each other. There results the separation, not temporary but permernant. Two people, who used to like each other, who used to say "I love you" are now met again. But no matter what, they are all "used to", she chose not to be friends, that's her choice, i respect her choice. I never regret to initiate the separation last year, i believe i made the most correct decision in my life till now, we are not suitable for each other. Now she is no longer part of my life, which I am happy with. I have my own life, hope that she will never enter my life again,  we shall be strangers.   ..................................................................................................................  Today, Cheryl, Debra and Lirong are leaving for italy for their Choir Trip, hope they enjoy themselves, it is great to have a break before all the tiring workloads flood onto everyone of us. Bon voyage and take care girls!  ..................................................................................................................  Everyday, lots of things happened, we can't be perfect for everything, even we want, it is impossible for everything, we need to give up at times and maybe just LET IT BE.

      Yesterday is success for Student Leaders' Convention Pre-Convention Briefing. All my worries about yesterday were gone..  I was afraid that nobody may turn up, I was afraid that the invitation CD will not work I was afraid that the program won't flow probably  I was afraid that I might say something wrong during the Briefing I was afraid that people will get bored I was afraid that the response is not so good I was afraid...  There are so many things to afraid of. Yesterday while me and Candice were at the School front gate, both of us are worried and afraid of all the same things. So she started tell me, God had helped her in her Chinese and she corrected me that, God helps everyone, people who wants to help himself and people who doesn't want to help himself, just that God's will not help in the way you want him to. So, she prayed, prayed that everything will be fine. and God, again, shine his power and love on all of us, it was a SUCCESS and all our worries are gone.   Just yesterday, got to meet a few new friends, Khurshed, Yisha and Prisicilla(the mythical girl). Life should be like that, full of happiness, full of challenges, full of love, full of smile. Just hope that everyday is like that, I never want to live in a day of dullness.  Now is already end of May, i am just wondering if my wish for this coming 18th birthday will come true. Actually that depends on fate, nothing i can do.  Looking forward the actual convention!

      i remember, the last time i am writing an online diary, it was last year, i was still in the unawaken nightmare. It was only when i wake up, i realise the nightmare i had. Anyway, it was already the past. Let it be...  This year lots of change in my life, was chosen as the Head Prefect, join St. Nicholas Prefectorial board for the Student Leader Convention. Life is tiring, there are so many instance that i want to give up. Guess it is the passion that keep me up. Met so many wonderful people this year, Candice, Cheryl, Debra, Lirong. These four girls are from the ExCo of St. Nicholas Prefectorial Board. Finally i have a group of good friends who are girls, which i never had in my life till now. Of course not to forget about my fantastic 3 brothers in Prefectorial Board, Daniel, Justin and Yangbin, they accompanied me been through so much, at least i have the three of them to share whenever i am in doubt. Thank you God for giving me all these wonderful friends.  Hasn't been in love for quite a while. Somehow i just have this strong feeling to fall in love. Truthfully speaking, the feeling is strong, to many people, even my friends, i maybe someone who they think fall in love with girls very easy. To them, maybe i am portrayed as a Playboy. However, I know exactly, clearly what i am doing. I just want to have a girl whom i can give my whole care to her and accepted by her. That's simple isn't it?  Turning 18 this September, 18 years old, means independent to me, means lot of decision making has come upon me. Should it be a turning point of myself or will there be a major change in myself? i don't know, i guess nobody knows.   Sometimes, though i have friends, i do still feel i have nobody to talk to and relate to, even with the presence of my mother and m best friends, i do still feel strongly, loneliness. I don't know why. Anyone can tell me?  Hoping for everyday, but it is so difficult to find something to look forward everyday.  Un-Luck, Un-Love, Un-Warm. The Un-Breakable is Breaking.

      I thought you will never know, but now you know.  You didn't turn away from me, but walk into my life  Becoming part of my life.  You said, you didn't have the confident thatyou can provide with what i need.  Oh dear, What i need? I just need someone who will accept my care and concern. That's the only thing i need.  You give me a hope, give us a hope, a hope that will never fail. Trust me, it will never fail. I keep my words with action.   17th June 2004 Marks a new beginning, the start of our story.  Past shall be forgotten, finally I walk out the darkness of the past.  Our shared memories, I will not forget.  The places where we left our footstep, East Coast Airport Viewing Mall they will be forver there.  Memory Time Laughter Everything WE shared WE wont forget.

      You will never know. How much you mean to me.  You will never know. How you have made my day brighter.  You will never know. Those steps we walked, print deep in my heart.  You will never know. How much you change me.  You will never know. How much I am afraid of letting my heart get hurt.  You will never know. I am looking forward to see you.  You will never know. I let my heart to keep all my feelings towards you, deep and deeper into my heart.  You will never know. There are only two choices lay in front of me. To Fight or to Give up.  You will never know. The day i go for TOEFL exam, i was thinking about you all day long.  You will never know. I like you.  You will never know. Maybe one day of many years and years later, somewhere on planet earth, I will be thinking of you again, and tell myself, I once like you. You will never know, and  I like you still.

      When you stop replying me, When you are not online, When you are having fun, When you start forgeting about me,  I feel lonely, troubled.  Who can I talk to?

         things turn out the way, i expected. i worried so much and it happened. Is it only me, who feel that SLC grown into me? Guess it happens to be only me. Myself I  I want worries to go away,  but they come in bulk. Pilling up! Hai... I said "It failed." I know it won't. It will be a success! I trust I believe    thank you for your understanding  thank you for understand my worries thank you for listening to me thank you for your encouragement thank you for everything  A paper-made basket you made yourself, as promised every folding of the paper holds your encouragement  It holds a small note you wrote every words meant a lot to me. It fulfilled its task. It brighten my dull day.  Thank you!    You gave me, my life 18 years ago You are someone I should love You are someone the least I should hate  But now You are someone I hate the most. You made my day worst. You never understand me. You never think of what I feel, since young You never understand my day  You only think of "wild" plans for me You only want me to take the Exams you wanted me to You only want me to get to US as soon as possible You only want me to have friends who are successful You only talk to me about what kind of life I should get You only talk to me about how successful are other kids You only talk to me about how fat I am You only want me to go in the way which you want me to  I tried to talk to you I tried to tell you how I feel I tried to open up to you I tried to tell you my problems I tried to share my happiness I tried to share my pain But you never listen I gave up.  You have nobody to vent your anger on but only Me and Mum.  You should be someone I love But I hate you.  --------------------------------------------------------  To people in my ExCo,PExCo and MExCo who bright my days, in my days of darkness Thank you! I love all my friends!

       Listening to Eason's old song, SHI NIAN ( Ten years)      I am thinking, tens years. A short and a long time.      Do i still remember anyone I met 10 years ago?   I don't remember      Is there anything or anyone leave me a deep impression 10 years ago?   I don't remember      Do i still remember who is the person sitting beside me in class?   I don't remember      Do i still remember how many times i cried 10 years ago?   I don't remember      Now i realise, memories do fade.      i just hope, 10 years later, no matter where I will be and who I am turning into.    I won't forget what i have now;   I won't forget I am typing now;   I won't forget the friends I have now;   I won't forget every moment;   I won't forget the reason why my tears shed;   I won't forget year 2004 I was in Singapore;   I won't forget every road I had walked before in this country;   I won't forget every pairs of footstep I had left on the ground on here;   I won't forget all those nights I shared with you under the stary sky;   I won't forget all those moments looking into your eyes;   I won't forget all the routes we walked, under the sun, in the wind, in the rain;   I won't forget Sunset by my window;   I won't forget every meetings with the SNGS PEXCO 2004;   I won't forget everything about Compassidence;   I won't forget all those laughter about the lamest jokes;   I won't forget the first EXCO of Prefectorial Board of Catholic High;   I won't forget all of you.      If one day, I do forget everything.   It will be the day, I will never wake up from my eternal sleep.      Maybe, you will forget me   Maybe, nobody treasure all these i treasure   Maybe, you had already forgotten   Maybe...   Maybe, there isn't a maybe at all.       "Nothing is as real as a dream. The world can change around you, but your dream will not. Responsibilities need not erase it. Duties need not obscure it. Because the dream is within you. NO ONE CAN TAKE IT AWAY."      -Pathatai
