      Well ,I just got back from the 24 Hours of Rapelje, which is just 30 miles west of Billings, Montana, and I am happy to report that I came away with the win in the Solo category.  This was one of the strangest 24 hour races I have done.  The town of Rapelje only has about 60 people in it , and there is nothing for as far as the eye can see in all directions.   The course was a 15 mile loop located in the high plains of the Rocky Mountains.  If I had to compair it to any other existing course it would be like Sea Otter (Laguna Seca).  Lots of big rolling hills, and NO trees.  Instead of trees, there were lots of cactus.  If you were not running "slime-like" tubes, you were screwed.  I am happy to report, that I did not have any flat tires during the entire race.  I did have a major mechanical, but I will talk about that later.  The race started at high noon.  It was about 75 degrees, and a strong wind out of the north.  The race started with the the always fun Le Mans run.  Out of all the racers, I was about the 3 person to my bike.  The first lap, I rode with two guys that were doing the "4-man" race.  The three of us took turn pulling through on the entire course, since it was wide open.  I was the 2nd one back into town on the first lap.  I swang by my tent for some H2O, and continued on.  Teh 2nd lap was awesome, until the one technical section of the entire course.  It was a downhill on some of the local Rimrock.  It was about 50 yards long, steep, and full of large loose softball size rocks.  Anyway, one of these rocks kicked up and ripped on my X-9 rear derailluer on my full suspension NRS.  I had to single speed it back to town, and switch bikes.  Because I was single speeding, my speed dropped, and was caught by half the Solo field.  NOT GOOD!  I was so mad.  I got back to the tent, and switchedt o my hardtail.  The course was very rough!  It was like riding down railroad tracks for the entire lap.   The course just ate me up.  I had to drop air pressure in my tires and soften up my Fox fork.  That did the trick and I continued to rage.  I kept turning out laps.  I had no idea who was a solo rider on course or a team rider.   Everyrider I would pass I would fly by, acting like I wasn't suffering, but i was, to make them think they were in for a long ride.    The laps continued.  I continued to eat, drink , and keep an eye on my equipment.  It couldn't have went any better.  The night riding went pretty quick.  The Cateye Stadium 3 light I was riding turned the high plains in to day.  My night laps were just as fast as my day laps.    I survived the night with no problems.  Day light broke, and looking at the results, I had accumulated a 4 lap lead.  For the rest of the race i just keep riding, keeping the pace nice and easy.  In the end, I had turned out 16 laps on the 15 mile loop.  The closest rider to me was at 12 in the end.  Overall, I felt pretty good.  The only thing super sore was my ass, from having to ride the hardtail for 15 laps.  I could have asked for a better race.  Everything worked good!  The WTB Epic Wolf tires had awesome hookup, the Fox fork saved my body, and the Cateye Stadium 3 headlight kept my speed up at night.  I recommend this race to anyone!  The people are super nice, the entry fee is only $50, the course will kick your ass, and if you win you get imortalized in local cafe (I am the only solo winner NOT from Montana in the races history).  The Stockman Cafe is who gets all the money from this race.  They treat you like a god!  They serve a meal after the race, that is worth the drive alone.  If you are interested in this race check out the website link below  http://cu.imt.net/~yvcc/  It's time to unpack and get ready for work.  If you have any questions about equipment, or this race please contact me.

      Well, It's just about time to leave for Montana.  I still have to get everything packed up, but that won't take too long.  I figured I will sit here and chug down a pot of the "black-goodness" ,a.k.a coffee, and fill you in on the equipment I will be using to try to take the win this weekend.    Here is the breakdown.  BIKE 1 Frame:  Giant NRS Carbon Fork: Fox F100X Brakes:  Avid Mech. Disc Controls:  Truvativ Team Components: Sram X-9 Crankset: Truvativ Stylo Saddle: WTB Tires: WTB Epic Wolf 1.95 Tubes: Slime PV (this is a recommendation of the race director) Pedals: Ritchey WCS  BIKE 2 Frame:  Giant XTC Alum/Carbon Hardtail Fork: Fox F80X Brakes:  Avid Mech. Disc Controls:  Truvativ Team Components: Sram X-9 Crankset: Truvativ Stylo Saddle: WTB Tires: WTB Epic Wolf 1.95 Tubes: Slime PV (this is a recommendation of the race director) Pedals: Ritchey WCS  LIGHTS Cateye Stadium 3  There is a quick look at the equipment.  I have ridden Giant NRS Air's the past 2 year before I was chosen for the Cateye Enduro Team, and I love the way the bike treats you when you sit on her for 24 hours.  I would recommend it to anyone, and I am not just saying this cause they are our sponsor.  Last night I par-took in the hammer fest of the Tuesday night road group ride.  I was surprised to see the super fast roadie guys didn't show up.  They must be planning a taper for this weekends Iowa State Road Race Championships.  As for me, I got 5 hours in on the Giant XTC last night.  I went out before the group ride and did some speed work on the local training hill.  I felt pretty good, but I still fade just a bit when i start to crest the hill so that is something I need to work on.  After the hills, I hit-up the group road ride.  Once again, I was giving a bad time about being on the mnt bike.  I don't let it bother me, I just let my riding do the talking.  I felt awesome!  I rode at the front all night, did a few attacks.  It's goin to be a good weekend.  It's time to pack.  I will try to update this "blog" as I find Interents connections between now and next Monday.  I hope my race goes well, and I don't have any mechanical problems such as getting one of those Montana prairie dogs stuck in my cassette.  That could get pretty messy.  Thanks for reading, and I hope the next time I post, I am telling you about how I won the 24 Hours of Rapelje.

      WOW!  All I have to say is that doing long rides sure does a number to the appetite.  During the race season it seems like my grocery bill increases ten fold.  I really need to get this under control.  Atleast doing long rides keeps the weight off.  Well, I have one more day of work left before I leave for Billngs, Montana.  I think tomorrow after work I will hit-up the Tuesday night death march, also known as the Tuesday night road group ride.  Once again, I am going to show up on my Giant XTC and hopefully inflict some pain.  I know a lot of the fast roadie guys will take it some what easy since this weekend is the Iowa State Road Race Championship over by Dubuque, Iowa.  Today, I went out for just 1.5 hours on the mnt bike to work on leg speed.  Just fast enough to keep the heart rate at a calm 140 pbm.  I felt pretty good, and hopefully it continues into the weekend.  I think I will praise some of my new equipment for this year.  The component sponsor for Cateye Enduro is SRAM.  I had a been a Shimano guy in the past.  Last year, I rode the new XTR dual control levers with disc brakes.  That stuff is the shiz-nit!  I never had problems with it, and it fits into my riding style.  This year we are running the X-9 trigger shifters and rear derailuer.  X-9 makes XTR and XT rapidfire shifter a joke.  The SRAM X-9 is so precise and solid.  There is no play or slop.  It's push, and your in your gear.  The other cool thing is you shift only with your thumb, unlike Shimano, where you use your thumb and pointer finger.  If you get the chance to ride SRAM X-9, or even X-7, you won't be sorry.  www.sram.com  In other news,  I see on MTBR.com where Tinker had his bike stolen at gunpoint.  That makes me glad I live in the heartland, where the worst thing that can happen is your neighbors cows get out and wonder onto the highway....just kidding!   I seen that on MTBR.com, my teammate Eric Warkentin won the solo 12 hour category at the 12 Hours of Weaverville in CA.  That dude is fast!    Also on MTBR.com  they are keeping tabs on the 8 or so guys and gal that are racing The Great Divide mountain bike trail.  Those guys are freaks.  It sounds like a good time, but I say that as I sit here in front of my computer and not at 10,000 feet in the pooring rain at 2:00 AM.  Well, thats about it.  I wil lkeep you posted maybe one more time until after I return from Montana next Monday.  Hopefully, I might be able to find a internet connection in Billings and post a few words.  Ride hard!!

      WA-HOO!!  My WTB race tires just showed up today.  I am so pumped. I was starting to wonder if they would ever show.  Anyway, They sent a bunch of their Epic Wolf tires in both 1.95 and 2.1.  It looks like it will be a good all-around tire.  Check out the link.   urlLink WTB Epic Wolf   I will give a good write up on how these tires perform after I get a crash-course on them in my 24 hour race in Montana next weekend.  I really don't have to much to say today.  I went out this morning for an easy spin on the mountain bike.  My legs felt pretty good considering last nights carnage road ride.  I guess what ever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.  I think the reason I stayed strong all last night was because of the Hammer/E-Cap products I have been using. It took me about a year of trail and error for proper nutrition for my endurance events.  I tried Hammer's products and low and behold the stuff works.  I use a wide range of their products such as Hammer Gel, Perpetum, Sustained Energy, Endurolytes, etc...  They offer extensive knowledge on endurance nutrition, and back up all their products no questions asked.  I invite you to check them out.   urlLink Hammer Products and E-Caps   Well, that's about it.  We are having a down moment here at work so I thought I would get a quick blog in.  This weekend is our big RAGBRAI Sale.  For those of you who don't know what RAGBRAI is, it's a week long ride across the state of Iowa.  Actually, it's a week long kegger across Iowa.  Everybody thinks it's the biggest thing since sliced bread.  When I am out doing my training rides in my Team clothing cars will pull up and ask me if I am training for RAGBRAI. RAGBRAI is a great time for the "Everyday" cyclist, but to the racer folk, it's a joke.  I have nothing against RAGBRAI.  I have worked it before, being a mechanic out on the route and you meet lots of nice people, but every year it becomes more and more like a college frat party with lots and lots of drinking.  I have seen riders pulling full size kegs behind their Cannondale touring bikes in a Burley trailer.  Nice!  If RAGBRAI sounds like you idea of a good time check it out.  They make you register to ride, but not everybody does, and I recommend NOT.     urlLink www.ragbrai.org    Thanks for reading!

      Well, I just got back from the Thursday night road group ride.  It was a tough ride.  I showed up for the ride on my hardtail Giant with slicks.  The group rides are always tough, cause we have a mixed bag of riders.  There are Cat 1's thru Cat 5's.  All guys give me crap for showing up on my mountain bike, but to tell you the truth, the pain that you feel during these ride on a mnt bike is about what it feels like at about hour 18 of a 24 hour race.  There is really no other way to simulate this pain and suffering.  As for the ride, it started out pretty mellow.  We were cruising along at about 22 mph, until we got to the first hill, then all hell broke loose.  All the fast guys started to attack, an I was forced to start getting on the pedals.  Cresting the hill, I felt pretty good so I attacked and got about a 100 yard gap on everybody.  The local "Pro Roadie" caught up quick and we worked together to the next town which was about 5 miles away.  I don't have a computer on my mnt bike, so as I gasped for air I asked my partner how fast and he said we were pulling down the road at 33 mph.  I was shocked, cause my legs felt good since i was spinning like mad in my 44 big ring.    As for the rest of the ride, we ended up riding for 5 hours, and out of the 11 of us that started the ride only 6 of us made it pack to town in the lead pack.  I was thrilled with my perfomance.  I feel like things are going to be coming together for the 24 Hours of Rapelje in Billings, MT next weekend.    Thats about it for now.  I am pretty tired and I need to crash so I can get up tomorrow and spin the legs out before work.  Thanks for reading!

      Who says bike shops are buisy in the summer?  I suppose since we just had some nasty weather move through, all the fair-weather cyclists will stay indoors until the sun shines again.  Oh Well.  I figure I can use this time to rant and rave.  We are all caught up on repairs and all the cool bikes are assembled.  Check out my employers website:   urlLink www.europacycle.com   Lets see....what product am I currently using that kicks ass?  How about my Giant NRS Air frame set.  This thing rocks.  I have riden the NRS Air's from the last two years, and this one takes the cake.  The main frame is now carbon, which has a high "bling-bling" factor.  Plus, Giant has upgraded the rear shock from Rock Shox to Fox.  This is the biggest improvement.  There is to more topping out or bottoming out.  It's always smooth like bud'er.  The weight of the bike has dropped a bit, but the biggest thing the carbon adds is it soaks up a lot of the little trail chatter.  Thanks Giant!!!   urlLink www.giant-bicycles.com   This morning I got a 3 hour road ride in.  The weather, is what we Iowan's call "Swamp-Ass" conditions.  Nasty, humid weather, which makes you feel like your ass is always sweating.  What a joy.    Anyway, the ride was all good, until the Fed-Ex home delivery van buzzed me.  I gave him the finger! The car directly behind him saw the whole thing and got a good laugh out of it.  If that van would have stopped at any of the farm houses along my ride, I swear I would have ripped off him mirror. Atleast I wasn't wearing any of my "Team" clothing, so I stayed somewhat under the radar.  In Other News...The coffee maker I ripped off from Wal-Mart is still shooting out 12 cups of coffee in under 8 minutes,  One of the names I did on a repair today was Dick Herter...pretty funny!,  I found a 12 hour race to go to on September 18 down by St. Louis, the chinese take-out place next to us here at the shop has parking signs out front that read..."East China Paking Only"....and I am not making this up., My co-worker tonight is wearing a pink t-shirt that says "Tough Guys Wear Pink."  Well that's about it.  Tomorrow it's back to work at 8, then back on the bike to get ready for the 24 Hour of Rapelje which is June 26-27 out in Billings, Montana. I think I might hit up the Thursday night road group ride.  I haven't done as many of these ride this year, since I have been focusing in riding alone to learn to stay focused during my longer races.  Thanks for reading, and why doesn't anyone comment on my boring life???  Just Kidding!

      I just got back from a 5 hour gravel-grinder on my Giant XTC Alum/Carbon hardtail.  The wind was a little brisk, but the worst part was the fact that the County DOT just dumped 3 inches of fresh gravel on every single mile of gravel road from here to the Minnesota border.   It was nothing but mashing on the pedals for the duration of the ride.  I am sure my legs will be screaming in the morning.  Anyway, I want to use this blog to pimp one of the sponsors for Cateye Enduro.  Our hydration pack sponsor is Polar Pak.     urlLink www.polarpak.com   Yes, they make hydration packs just like the other brands, but..... the cool thing is that the bladder is filled with a gel which can be froze in the freezer or heated up.   So, if you want cold water, freeze the bladder over night.  Get it out for you ride and throw it in the pack, and off you go.  I did a 4 hour ride in 90 degree weather about a week ago, and the water stayed chilled the entire duration.  I have used Camelbacks and Hydrapacks before getting hooked up with Polar Pak.  Hands down, I would pick the Polar Pak over the other companies.  Check out their website.  They make all kinds of different packs based on riding style and activitiy.  The other day I did my part to take slow the corporate take over of the world by Wal-Mart.  I don't know if it's just in the Midwest, but it seems like every town has one of these places.  Anyway, I had a coffee maker that was brewing slow....as in like 3 hours slow.  I tried all the tricks to fix it....vinegar, cleaning solution, etc.  Well I went to Sprawl-Mart, I mean Wal-mart and bought the same coffee maker.  When I got home, I just cleaned up my old one and stuck it in the box, and took it right back.  Presto!  Hot coffee fast, and it didn't cost me anything!  DOWN WITH WAL-MART!!!!!  That's about all for now.  If I come up with anything else before i crash, I am sure I will post it here.

      Well, here I go.  This is my "official" first rant.   It's 12:24 in the morning here in the flatlands of Iowa, and I woke up to go to the bathroom and am having a hard time geting back to sleep, so i thought I would give you the low-down for my 2004 race season.  This year I am racing for the newly formed endurance racing team known as Cateye Enduro.     urlLink http://www.cateye.com/news/enduro_team.html   The purpose of this new team is to promote Cateye, and to test some new "high-tech" lights that they will be having come out sometime in the next 2 years.  All riders on the team are raging on Giant NRS AIR's, with Fox forks.  This combination is super plush and is ideal for long distance cycling.  Most of the races being hit up by the team include Trans-Rockies, La Ruta, 24 Nationals and Worlds, and other local events.  For me, I have only been able to ge to one event this year and that was the 12 Hours of Stump Farm in Green Bay, WI   urlLink www.wemseries.com   I ended up placing 2nd in the solo race which was good enough for the first race of the year.  The next race on the calander is the 24 Hours of Rapelje in Billings, MT.  This race looks interesting to say the least.  The town is so small that everyone is asked to carry everything in.  Plus, I don't think there are any trees on course.  Weird huh...?    Well, I am starting to get a little sleepy.  I need to get some rest for tomorrows big day in the saddle.    Stay posted to this site for rider updates, rants, thoughts, etc......

      Good day fat tire freaks!  Holy Cow do my legs feel like foo!  It's weird that I can go out and do a 6-10 hour endurance ride and get up the next day and still be able to go back out the next day and pedal at least one of my bikes.  Tuesday night was a road group ride, and I have still not recovered from it.  If you recall from my earlier blogs in the week, I was blow'n out the back while trying to hang with the group while going up hill at near 35 mph.  Who rides up hill that fast?  It must be a roadie thing.  I wish I could pull that off at my endurance races :-)  Yesterday I went out and did some tempo work on the mountain bike.  My legs felt pretty good doing that, but as soon as I started to rage, the dreaded BURN worked it's way back into my thighs.  Oh well, I just need to chill out for awhile.  Yesterday after my ride I got to do my first "scheduled" photo shoot.  How fun!  I meet up with the photographer that works with the Writer that is working up my story for this Saturdays paper.  It was pretty interesting.  The Photographer was like...."Do this."  "Do that." "Ride over that while looking over there."  "Don't smile."  "Ride over there, turn around, hop on 1 foot, pat your belly."   "Huck off that shelter house."   Well, you get the idea.  And, NO, there was no hucking.   Jeff does NOT huck!  I hope the pics turn out pretty cool, and I get some good exposure for the sport and my sponsors.   Look for the story to run tomorrow at the following link.  www.wcfcourier.com  Today, is going to be a early A.M. recovery ride, then to work.  Tomorrow I plan to a hilly gravel grinder to work on leg speed for climbing.  Just alittle more prep for Whistler, cause we all know Whsitler ain't flat.  Out!

      OK, endurance racers.  Here is a list of some of my favorite 12/24 hour race foods which can be picked up at your local grocery store.  1.  Ramen Noodles 2.  Ensure (it's not just for old people!) 3.  Clif Bars 4.  Balance Bars 5.  Flour Totilla filled with PB, honey, and a banana (Oh Yeah!) 6.  Coffee, a.k.a The Black Goodness 7.  Red Bull 8.  Kellogs Krave bar 9.  PB and Jelly Sandwich 10.  Cookies 11.  Chicken Noodle soup 12.  Vat O' Mustard (just kidding!) 13.  Pasta and olive oil 14.  Gummy Bears  This is just a short list of the "normal" foods I eat during longer races.  I also use a wide variety of Hammer / E-Cap products.  My legs were shot from the fury of last nights ride, so I just went out for a 2 hour spin on the local bike path with the mountain bike.  Tomorrow is another group ride.  I hope i am ready for this one.

      I official got my butt kick tonight on the road group ride. I'm not worthy! I'm not worthy!  Uncle! Uncle!  I went out 2 hours before the group ride and did about 5 five mile lactate threshold intervals with the Cat.1 State Champion.  That was painful, but again it's supposed to be.  I survived the intervals, and was pumped for the group ride.  We left town with a group of about 6 or us.  All the riders in the pack were Cat 2 or higher.  And then there was me, that  guy whose rides his mountain bike for extreme amounts of time.  And whats this.....he's on a road bike.   Yep, thats right. I broke out the road rocket.  The only thing, is that it wasn't a road rocket.    I survived the first 35 miles or so before I got throttled out the back while trying to hang on to the guy pulling up the hill at 32 MPH!  Oh well,  I would love to get all those guys into my element.   They wouldn't stand a chance.  I limped into town on my own, licking my wounds.    Tomorrow is a group mt. bike ride and Thursday is another road group ride.  I will have to attempt to get sweet revenge  Keep you eye to the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier Newspaper this Saturday, cause the Cedar Valley is about to meet the "Super Freak"  www.wcfcourier.com  Rage On!!

      Wow!  I just got back from a 5 hour hammer fest mountain bike ride.   I drove down to Sugar Bottom, which is just North of Iowa City.  My goal was to rage for 5 hours straight without stopping at a higher heartrate than my normal 12/24 hour pace .  Mission Accomplished, but I won't be able to walk tomorrow.    I got down there around 7:00, and filled up the PolarPak, and loaded my pockets with a Clif Bar and Hammer Gel and off I went.   I started cranking out lap after lap on the 10 mile loop.  The course was in excellent shape so the speed was high.  On lap 2 I about mowed down Bambi.  On lap 3 I about mowed down the Trail Patrol, and on lap 4 I about took out a family of 4 on Hybrid bikes with NO helmets.  Yes, I said Hybrid bikes.  The trail is next to the campground, so some families venture into the unkown of the mountain bike world.    My bike worked flawless once again, and my leg felt pretty good.  Not 100%, but good considering I put in a 3 and 4 hour days in on the road bike leading up to this ride.  Tomorrow I will do a short recovery ride and get myself pumped for the bloody furry that is the Tuesday night road group ride.    Oh, I almost forgot.   WAY TO GO POSTIES!  RAGE ON!!!  P.S.  If one of you two super freaks from Green Man are reading this, I hope you 8-10 hour road ride was a treat!

      Here are are my Top 10 signs that you are an endurance racer.  10.  While grocery shopping, you pass the Mayo and think to yourself "I wonder if that could work as Chamois Cream?"  9.  A 2 hour XC race never seemed so easy....."Was that the warm-up?"  8.  2 hour training rides are now 8+ hour training rides...."Sweet, the sunrise!  Sweet the Sunset!"  7.  What other style of bicycle racing allows you to stop mid race and eat a pizza?......."Can you scape off the meat?  It won't digest fast enough."  6.  You spend time reading this blog, and wonder if there will ever be "Cliff Notes" available for it  5.  Instead of calling your name, people now just say "Hey freak!"  4.

      Well, I couldn't hold out any longer.  I hopped on my road bike this morning and threw the hammer down.  I went out and did a 3 hour time trial, and ended up at about 68 miles.  Not too shabby since the last time I sat on my bike was last Saturday at the 12 Hours of Green.    The first hour sucked!  It hurt soooo bad.  My legs were chunks of cement.  I worked through it, and everything started to click over pretty good.    For the second part of the season, I have 3 major races.  The 24 Hours of 9 Mile in Wausau, Wisconsin, The 24 Hour Solo World Championships in Whistler, British Columbia, and the 24 Hours of Moab.  I am going to have to focus on some fat miles.  24 Hours of 9 Mile has a 15 mile loop, and when I did it 2 years ago I came just shy of 270 miles for the 24 hours.  That was a treat for my first ever 24 hour race.  Plus, Tinker was there and I had to attempt to keep up with him.  I came out pretty good.  He only beat me by one lap.  Well, it's time to check up on the Tour, and get ready for work.    Thanks for reading and keep on RAGE'N!

      Not much to talk about.  I am still in mid-season recovery.  It couldn't have come at a better time cause we are swamped at work, so i have been putting in longer hours.  I might hop on the road bike tomorrow, but it's no big deal if I don't.  Well, It's back to resting.   Ahhhhhh........

      There is nothing better than a mid-season break.  It has been 3 days now since I have sat on any of my bikes.  I wish I could go out and rage the group rides, but I know that if i want to do well and the 24 Hours of 9 Mile, World's in B.C., and the 24 Hours of Moab that I need to take a bit of a break.  Remember Kid's....rest is just as important as training.  Other than relaxing I have been eating.....and eating, and eating, and eating.  Did I mention eating?  That shouldn't come to no suprise since 12 Hour Nationals was at a cut-throat pace.  At my 24 hour race in Montana in June I spent just shy of 19,000 calories according to my Polar S210 HR monitor.  At last Saturday's race which was half as long I used a whopping 15,000.  That is only a 4,000 calorie difference for 12 hours.  Good God!   My average HR for 12 and 24 Hour events runs right around 160 BPM.  Last weekend my average was 178.   What the hell???  Oh well, there is nothing wrong with alittle suffering.  Today after work I was interview by the Waterloo/Cedar Falls Courier Newspaper.  It was great to tell the reporter what I do and have him sit there with his mouth hangin off the table in disbelief.  The look was priceless.  Look for the story to run in the paper and website in the next few weeks.  www.wcfcourier.com  Well, that is about it.  Tomorrow I am going to get out for a short road bike spin around, and think about a long mnt bike ride this weekend.  I am hoping for a 8 hour ride at Sugar Bottom in IA City, provided the trails are open.  Sugar Bottom has been closed so much this year.  They must have some new strict Trail Nazi patroling down there.  If anyone cares to join me this weekend for a long ride, just post or e-mail me.  If you work at a bike shop and are reading this, I have a great idea for a Tour advertisement for your local newspaper.  It would go something like this...... Now Through July 25 it's the Jan Ullrich You Blow Sale.   All floor pumps are 1/2 price.  Stock up for next year!  Ok, I know that's mean, and I better be quiet.....hey, he does ride a sweet bike.  I am out!

      Well I just returned from the suffer-fest that was the 12 Hours of Green National Championships in Duluth, MN.  The race didn't end up how I had been thinking about it for the past few weeks, but I have nothing to complain about.  The race started at 7 AM with a short hill climb to spread out the field.  The course was about 5.5 miles per lap.  It  had a mixture of everything: roots, rocks, pavement, singletrack, boulder fields, short steep climbs, pot smokers, etc.  There was a small field of Solo riders (23 if your counting at home), but everyone of them had a very good shot at winning this race.    There was about 5 of us that got away from the rest of the race, and opened up a huge lead.  About a mile later, one of the solo riders jumped off the front, one of the other solo riders who knew him said to let him go, so we did.  This would be the last I would see of this rider till the end of the race.  Anyway,  The 4 of us rode together lap after lap, keeping the pace high enough so that no other solo rider would bridge up to us.  On the 3 lap, we lost one of our pack riders.  He fell off the back, and was never seen again.  The 3 of us continued on, and the 3rd guy said to work together to catch the solo leader.  No more than a 1/2 mile after he said that he flated with his tubless tires flying down this fireroad.  It was his front tire, so he lost control and Superman'd into the grass.  He was OK, and finished the race.   There was just 2 of us left to try to catch the solo leader(the 2 of us being myself, and the rider that beat me at 12 Hour of Green Bay earlier in the season).  We road together till about the 7th lap, when I had to stop for chain lube, and some nutrition.   He saw this an attacked.  I tried to track him down, but it never came.  During this time I had a 4 lap stretch where I felt like crap.  I was fighting the bike,was un-smooth, and had no power to the pedals. At the end of the 7th lap I got back to my pit and slammed down a Red Bull, and it gave me wings!  I was rage'n for like 5 laps, and manages to lap the guy that was riding with us earlier that had flatted.   Now there were 3 of us on the lead lap  The solo leader dangling up front was caught and passed.  He ended up second overall, and the rider that attacked me eventually went on to win.    As for me, I ended up 3rd overall.  I have nothing to hang my head about.  All my equipment worked flawlessly, and my nutrition work.  I just had a few bad laps.  That's just how it goes.   Are you wondering about Mary-J?  Well, this race was run during the Green Man Sport and Music Festival.  What this is, is a modern day Woodstock.  The course actually went through the campground of this event.  So during about 65% of the race there were always these wanna-be hippies standing by the course hooting and hollaring, drinking beer, peeing in the grass; all while trying to hide their chronic.  It was funny cause you wouldn't know if you were coming up on the dust trail of the rider in front of you, or if it was pot smoke.      Oh, the joys of 12 hour racing.  Stay posted, cause I will post some photos and write up some more when I am not so beat.  Rage On!!!  NOTE TO READER:  I am not responsible for spelling or grammer.....you try to write a race recap after racing for 12 hours!  Just Kidding!!!  :-)

      I have some awesome news.  After a early season mix-up with some clothing sponsorship for the Cateye Enduro Team, the new clothing will be here shortly!!!!  We will be having the Euro clothing company called Agu print up the clothing.    www.agu.nl     (it's in Dutch, but you can choose to have the site published in English)  They have done the team clothing for teams such as Rabobank, Phonak, etc.  Should be some sweet stuff.  I have a picture of the clothing, but it is TOP SECRET.  The only thing I can tell you is that it is red, black, and white.   Today is an ultra short blog.  I am going to go out and do an easy road ride on my road bike, then head to work from noon to 8.  Rage On!!!

      Well, I had to ride my road bike on the road group ride instead of showing on the mountain bike.  I just got both of my mountain bikes dialed in for 12 Hour Nationals this weekend in Duluth, MN.  I don't understand how some of the guys just ride road bikes and never venture off road.  Road riding is so stale, and mind numbing.  Plus, you can't attack the group on the gravel shoulder with a road bike like you can with a mountain bike....they never see that one coming....heeeeee!  Tonights ride wasn't anything special.  I set my HR monitor to beep at 165, to tell me to back off.  I did this, so I don't fry my legs for this weekend.  So, I rode as hard as I could with the group unitl the HR monitor went beep, beep , beep.   There was a few times I got shot out the back, because i hit the 165 mark.  But, Oh well.  I have put a new picture on my profile.  This was taken by a gentlemen at the Green Bay 12 Hour Race.  I hope to have a picture from the 24 Hour Montana race to post soon.  I have to get that from my parents, and I won't see them till this weekend.  Well that's about it for today.  I will leave you with some fine words of advice  The road bike is the true portal to hell, or if you're a Star Wars junkie, it's the Dark Side!  Rage On!!!!   p.s.  I really didn't mean what I said about the road bikes, so you roadies out there that are reading this can call off your "Hits" on me now.

      Todays blog is being brought to you by the letter "R."  Why "R" you ask?  Well here is why....rocks, rough roads, and rain.  Todays ride was my last long effort before 12 Hr Nationals next weekend in Duluth, MN.  There were about 4 of us riding.  We decided to do a gravel grinder (see Webster's Dict. defenition below) down south to Tama/Toledo (about 40-45 miles one-way).  There was a 10 mph headwind.  The guys I was riding with just wanted an easy ride, so I stayed up front and pulled them all the way.  2 of the guys had to be back early, so they turned around about 20 miles into the ride.  Myself and the other guy kept riding.   This is a good ride do to the amount of climbing and the roughness of the road.  Plus, the rocks were really loose, so we were having a hard time controling the bikes.    GRAVEL GRINDER:  (v.) An Iowan's substitute to fireroads, mountains, singletrack, and downhilling  We made it as far south as we were going to go, then turned a round.  Behind us was what would soon be the "Great 40 Mile Down Pour"  We started headding north, and the skies kept getting darker and darker.  In a matter of 15 minutes after turning around, it began to pour.   If you want to know what the riding was like, put on your cycling clothes, hop in the shower, and turn on the cold water on high.  Then get a buddy to start throwing sand in your face.  All I can say is "Good Times!!!!"  This continued all the freaking way to Waterloo.  It finally let up once we were about 2 miles from home.  Oh well,  It was probably a sign of the conditions to come at either National's or World's.  Either way, if it is I will be ready now.    Hope everyone else had a dry and painless ride today.   Time to sit down to a nice big plate of whole wheat pasta.  YUMMMM!  Keep an eye to www.Velonews.com.  Today was UCI Marathon Worlds in Austria.  Should be a good read!  Oh, by the way, todays ride was 5.5 hours for those of you keeping track  Rage On!!

      Good morning!  Todays blog is being brought to you inpart by "Udderly Smooth."  White....creamy....soft....supple....Did I just say supple? Doh! Anywho, Undderly Smooth is the cheap version of Chamois Butter.  It can be picked up at Wally-World for less than 2 bills, and it keeps your bits nice and soft while your out logging the long miles.  Give it a try.  Your man-hood, and women-hood will thank you!  www.uddercream.com   If anyone out there is interested in saving 15% on Hammer Gel and/or E-Cap products, shoot me an e-mail that has your e-mail address, and I will send you an e-mail back that will allow you to pick and choose from their awesome products and save some cash!!!!  www.e-caps.com    Today I will be doing hill repeats.  For this I will be riding up Lookout Park Hill in Cedar Falls 21 times.  I do a hill repeat in every gear combination except for my "granny-gear."  It sucks and it's very painful.   I just think of the day when I will be able to power up this hill on my road bike in my big ring like Tony Kisch.  That dude is a horse!   Well, it's time to suit up in my superman outfit and rage the hill.  But first, I need to throttle down this last rich and delicious cup of the black-goodness.  As always, R-A-G-E  O-N!

      No riding today.  My legs are sore, and I want to be able to put atleast a 10 hour day in on Sunday.  I think I will just load up on food, and curl up with some back issues of Dirt Rag.  If anyone is interested in joining me for either all or part of my ride on Sunday, just e-mail me, or post on this site.   I am planning on either Sugarbottom outside Iowa City or Decorah.

      After yesterdays near 10 hour day in the saddle, today was a well deserved recovery ride.  I went out on the road bike for a little urban roll-a-round.  I kept the heart rate at or below 120 bpm.  I also stayed with in 2 clicks of my 39-23.  Super easy gear, for super easy ridin.  It felt awesome.  It was like someone was giving my leg a rubdown.    I suppose I could fill you in on some more of the gear I am using this year as part of the Cateye Enduro Team.  Our fork and rear suspension sponsor is FOX.  Lets just say that the other suspension companies don't stand a chance against Fox if things keep going the way they are.  This year I am riding the F80X and the F100X.  Both of these shocks rock!  They have the inertia valve in them kind of like the Specialized Brain shock on the Epic.  The fork is locked out until you hit a bump.  The cool thing is you can adjust how sensetive the fork will be to the bumps.  The weight of the forks is a bit higher than a Manitou or rock Shox, but for what you gain it is worth the penalty.  Also,  the Fox forks are super stiff.  I had been a Rock Shock SID user the past 3 years, and the first ride I could tell a huge difference.  The Fox fork goes right where you point it.  The only down fall to these forks is the price.  To the "average joe" these forks can set you back about $750 each.  OUCH!  But, look at what your getting in terms of technology and company support.  No other company can match it.  Check out there website for more info.  www.foxracingshox.com  Off to work.  Go Lance! Go Tyler! God, the Tour kicks major ass!  Rage On!

      Ok, I am officialy cooked!  You can stick a fork in me.  Tonights ride came out to 4.5 hours.  That's 9.5 hours for the day.  The group ride was NOT nice.  We had a newbie that was in town from Ft. Collins, CO.  I think all the fast roadies wanted to give him a flat landers welcome.  There was about a 15 mph head wind for the first 8 miles, which wasn't bad, cause it slowed the group down, but once we had the wind at our back, I could turn my 44T big ring fast enough to keep up with those guys and their 53's.  I was shot out the back along with some of the Cat. 3,4, and 5's.  I had to keep on it just to keep in contact.  Needless to say, this has been one of my hardest training rides this year.    THANKS ROADIES!!!!!!  Tomorrow, its an 1 hr easy spin followed by work.  I wish I could type more for you guys, but I am beat!  Rage On!

      I just got back from a 5 hour mountain bike ride, in which I rode on-road with full knobbies.  I felt pretty good.  Once again, it took about 2 hours to get the leg ticking over in a good pace.  Overall average heartrate was around 153 bpm.  That's good, cause that is my 12/24 hour race pace.  Now, I am going to slurp down a liquid protein smoothie, and elevate the leg and maybe take a nap.  After that it's back to the bike for the Tuesday night death march....I mean friendly road group ride.  Check back later.

      Happy Tuesday to all!  I have the day off today.  That means no "wrenching" on dept. store bike  or garage rot bikes.  Those aren't the only bike that we get at the shop, but it's about 50% of them.  I am happy to see that people are starting to realize that dept. store are not worth the money.  So, they come to us and by a $190 Trek mountain bike instead of buying 5 dept. store bike within the month.  How many of you have been keeping tabs on the Great Divide Race?  It was awesome to read and see Mike Curiak beat the tar out of the old record.  I can't imagine how hard that is on the body.  The longgest I have riden has been in my 24 Hour races.  Eventhough the pace is higher, I am still toast afterwords for like a week.  I am sure that Mike and the other riders will be in recovery mode for atleast a month.  Congrats to Mike and the other riders just for trying this!   Check out the race recap with photos at the link below: http://www.mtbr.com/gdr/  As for me, I plan to get some good bike time in today.  I plan on hitting up the local road group ride.  Tonights wepon of choice will once again be my Giant XTC hardtail.  As for tires, I have gone to a bigger tire for more resistance.  I was running a 26 x 1 Ritchey Tom Slick, this time I will be trying to rage on a 26 x 1.95 semi-slick.  This will be my first group ride since my win at the Montana 24 Hour race.  I hope that I can re-adapt to the intensity.  As I like to say....I will bleed out my eyes.  Bring the Pain!  Two weeks and counting until the 12 Hour National Championships in Duluth, Minnesota.  This is the first 12 Hour Nationals that I am aware of.  A lot of people have been posting on the race website asking what classifies this as a "National" race.  As long as its USA Cycling sanctioned, I believe that is it.  I hope they give out a Stars and Stripe jersy to the winner.  That would be nice to put next to my 7 Iowa State NORBA Expert XC Titles.  Well, I am going to chug down the rest of this rich amd creamy pot of French Vanilla coffee, surf the net, and then hit up the bike for some high quality saddle time.  RAGE ON!

      Six hours and 43 minutes is how long it took me to do my gravel grinder training ride today.  For those of you reading this that are familiar with Iowa, these are the towns that I passed either through or by:  Hudson Holland Steamboat Rock Iowa Falls Ackley Aplington Parkersburg and finally New Hartford  I felt pretty good,  I only had to outrun 4 dogs and one crazy old lady on her way to church.  The crazy old lady was the worst.  The funny thing is, she came up behind me, she didn't see me, and if i wouldn't  have gone into a mad sprint she would have drove over me at about 25 MPH.  Old people rock!  I think for the rest of this July 4th, I am going to recover from todays ride, by reading the latest issue of Velonews.  Has anyone else notice that the last 2 issues of velonews have had a "pink" theme going on with there covers.  Weird! Surfing the net for Tour pictures and news is always a good time, and a good recovery tool.  Maybe I might go out later and spin around the State Park.  Either way, I need to get a 3 hour ride in before work tomorrow.  Well that's about it for today,  I am going into recovery mode.  I almost forgot!  Todays  "Endurance Racer Tip of the Day" is get rid of your rubber handlebar grips and put on Gel Cork tape.  It's super cush, and your palms and wrist will thank you.  RAGE ON!!

      I just got in from a 3.5 hour mountain bike ride on the road.  It's a warm one today.  I went out at 6:00 AM, and the humidity made it feel like 90 degrees, and I was riding in the middle of a swimming pool.  On a scale of 1-10 (10 being the worst), todays "Swamp-Ass" conditions are at 8.  It's one of those days that you need atleast a hand full of chamois butter.  The ride went well.  It took me about 1.5 hours to get my legs feeling good, once they started ticking, I felt really strong, and was going pretty good and keeping my HR low at about 150ish.  I have uploaded a new picture to my profile.  This picture is from the Wisconsin Endurance Mountain Bike Series race that was held in Green Bay.  The rider behind me is Nature Valley/Penn Cycle rider	Ray Coyle.  We road together for about 10 hours of the 12 hour race.  On the 11th lap, my legs weren't feeling all that spunky, so I told him to go on by hemself so i wouldnt slow him down.  He finished strong for a 1st place win, while I came in 2nd.  We talked during the race, and he said that he was using these races to get ready for the Leadville 100.  Good Luck to him!!  That's about it for today.  I am do into work at noon, and need to run to the store quick to get some bananas.  Thanks for reading

      Good morning world!  Just thought I would get a brief Blog in before I head off to work to clean up my bikes and help out the people of the Cedar Valley with all their bicycle needs.  I went out yesterday morning for a 2 hour spin around to see how the leg feel after the 24 hour race in  Montana.  The legs felt great, but my ass felt like someone was sticking me with a fork everytime I sat down on my saddle.  My co-work (The-Chad) last night had the honor of listening to me talk about my ass pain.  I bet he loved that!   I guess riding the hard tail for 23 hours in the race was the smartest thing to do for my body. Oh well, I am sure i will heal.    Tonight  is yet another Thursday night group road ride.  I am going to show up on my Gaint XTC hardtail, so i can work on leg speed some more.   I am really going to be pushing it pretty hard these next couple weeks , cause the 12 Hour National Champonships are coming up on July 16-17-18 in the mountain biking mecca of Duluth, Minnesota.   Check out the link.   Its a Sports and Music festival.  Willie Nelson is supposed to be playing during the race.   What a better way to suffer than to listen to Willie Nelson and ride for 12 hours.  Ahhhhh....bicycles, and guitar playing pot smokers!  www.greenmanfestival.com  In other notes, 2 of my Cateye Enduro teammates had great results these past few weeks.  Lou K., pulled off a 2 place in the womens race at the Cascade Creampuff 100 out in Oregon, and Eric W. raged to a win at the 12 Hours of Weaverville out in California.    http://www.cateye.com/news/enduro_team.html  This weekend is July 4th!  Fireworks are not allowed in Iowa, but I am suer I will find some and blow stuff up.  I can't think of any better way to celebrate the USA's freedom , than to blow off 3 of my fingers.  I suppose i could go out and do a long mnt bike ride......fireworks, ride, fireworks, ride, fireworks, ride......?  Ride it is!  I am planning on heading down to Sugarbottom in Iowa City on Sunday for a 8-10 hour training ride.  Thanks for reading and have a exciting day!

This weekend is the Leadville 100  Good Luck to the following people:  John Adamson racing for Bike Tech from Cedar Falls, Iowa  Connie Inks racing for Bike Tech also from Cedar Falls, Iowa  Ray Coyle racing for Nature Valley/Penn Cycle from Minneapolis.  Ray has been racing strong at all the midwest 12 Hour events.  He won 12 Hours of Green  The Des Moines XC Mafia....I saw the start list and I know that there is a butt load of you guys heading out.

      Ahhhhhhhh.....the power of cheese.  No, cheese is not a race food.  Could you imagine coming thru at 3 AM and be like "Hey pit crew, break me off a piece of that Chedder and get me a new battery for my lights."   Then try to get that down your pipe? Goooooooo!  Better yet.....I could fill my Hammer flasks with Cheese Wiz.   Sweet!  Nome's you ask?  Wausau has a Nome-fest.  Don't ask!  This will be my last "blog" until I return on Sunday night.  Right now I am pulling some of my supplies together, and pounding down a 12 cup pot of Chocolate-Caramel coffee.  This stuff is the shiz-nit!  Anyway,   I plan on heading out around 10:00 AM, getting up there, and finding the best pit area for quick entry and exit for refueling.  I think everything is in order.  The bikes are dialed in, I have loading on the Hammer Products all week, and the stress level is low.  Now, my body has to do its part.    There is one thing that will suck at this race........darkness!  Lights will be needed around 8:30 pm and won't come off till 6:30 am or so.  That is 10 hours of NO sun.  This will be the toughest part of the race.  Mentality will play a huge part.   As the great Adam Sandler would say........"The Night Time is the Right Time, The Night Time is the Right Time"   I have somethiing up my sleeve for the evening laps.   If you want to know, you have to talk to Mark at Europa Cycle and Ski.  It's a well thought out plan, that will create havoc on the Solo field......Ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!  Evil!   Well, I need to get more stuff together, and  finish my "black goodness"    Thanks for reading, and if I have a chance I might test out the Audioblog feature later today or this weekend.  Off to Rage!

      Well, yesterday was the local tuesday night road group ride, and I didn't show.  Why not?  I was looking at the Weather Channel.com and saw that we were having one of those super windy days (20 mph NNW wind).  So, I decided to go out and train mind and body.   In 90% of my 12 and 24 hour races you are forced to ride by yourself, facing the elements for yourself.  Doing these 3-4 hour ride into a strong headwind builds up power, while teaching the mind that there in no backing out.  It's too easy to get tired during a road group ride and just sneek to the back of the pack and draft.  When you are by yourself, that is NOT an option.   My legs have felt pretty good the last few days, and I think this weekend is going to turn out pretty well.  Once again, doing well plays into many factors such as weather, equipment, fitness, and pit crew.  My goal for this race, other than getting first in the Solo Freak category, is to turn 20 laps.  As far as I know, that has not been done.  In 2002 when Tinker beat me, he only turned 18 laps, and I turned 17.  I feel 20 is doable, but I am not going to demolish myself trying with World's just a few weeks away.  If that goal is in reach I will go for it.

      10.  You left in your 39 x 23, and returned home in your 39 x 23. 9.  The ride was alittle over 1 hour. 8.  Your average speed was lower than the average wind speed. 7.  Your average heartrate was a whopping 118 bpm. 6.  You get passed by the local "FRED", and he thinks that all his training is finally paying off. 5.  That little old lady on the motorized cart passes you like your standing still. 4.  You could wear that same cycling clothing again tomorrow (not that I am going to......Grooooossss!) 3.  The hardest thing you did during the ride was changing a friends flat tire (Yes, Megan, I am talking about you!) 2.  You have no urge to raid the kitchen for food. 1.  Your saddle sores hurt worse than when you left, and why are they all red now?

            urlLink Tifosi Quam 1.0  Originally uploaded by  urlLink kerkovej .    STATS: Technically superior glasses for the everyday cyclist, the Tifosi's interchangeable polycarbonate lenses flex to providing you with excellent eye protection and the decentering process eliminates distortion for optical clarity and less eye fatigue. Vented Grilamid frames provide strength and resistance to fogging. Ventilated Hydrophilic nose and earpieces actually get sticky for a non-slip fit. Includes: Smoke (15%-LT), AC-Red (27%-LT) and Clear (93%-LT) lenses, carrying case and cleaning bag. Quam 1.0 fits faces small to medium and Quam 2.0 fits faces medium to large.  BEST THING: The Price! They are only $49 for a set of shades that come with 3 sets of lenses, a hard case, and a cleaning bag. The fit is great....super snug and no slip. Comes in 2 sizes for different face sizes. They don't fog up. Chicks dig'um!....I think?  WORST THING: Worst thing......What are you talking about?  MY VERDICT: I am all up on these glasses. If you like Smith or Rudy Project these are an inexpensive alternative. I was a Rudy Project user before getting hooked up with these for being on Cateye Enduro. They work just as good, plus my Rudy's would fog up. My Tifosi's don't! Also, the fit is a bit more off-road friendly than other shades I have used. The Tifosi's fit a bit tighter, so you don't have to worry about them falling off your face or out of your helmet if you stick them in your helmet vents while not wearing them. All in All, I give these shades a 10 based on value, function, and durability!!!  www.tifosioptics.com

      Well, it's Sunday, Sunday, Sunday (you are supposed to say Sunday in that booming monster truck voice).  This is what I have on tap.  This morning at 7:30 A.M. I am meeting up with "Carlos the Jakel" for a little 3 hour gravel grind'r carnage to Parkersburg and back.  This loop rocks.  Lots of loose gravel and lots of steep hills.  Steep by Iowa standards.  After that I ge to got work.....Oh Joy!  Shouldn't be too bad, we haven't alot of psyhco's come in lately.  As for the rest of the week..... Monday: Easy spin on the bike Tuesday: Hang on to the Tueday Night Road Ride.  I am looking to get in an hard effort before 24 Hrs of 9 Mile. Plan on going hard enough to openup the legs, but NOT to destroy them for 24-9 Wensday:  Easy spin on road bike Thursday:  Few short bursts, and hill repeats Friday:  Drive to Wausau for 24-9 and hangout / pre-ride Saturday: Race Sunday: Race and recover for World's Yo!

        urlLink        urlLink Start of Trans Alps     Originally uploaded by  urlLink kerkovej .     Here is a write up from Lou Kobin from Trans-Alps.  I found it to be a good read, and thought i would share it with the rest of you.  ENJOY!  Below is Louise's report from the Trans-alps.   Cristina Begy and I didn't start out with the best of luck at the trans-alps.Â  At the end of the first day had a really long road descent and as we were flying down, a van came around a blind curve.Â  Cristina had to slam on her brakes to avoid a head-on collision, she slid out with the bike going under the van, and then I flew over my handle-bars trying not to run over Cristina.  I had a deep cut in one elbow, and road-rash on both knees.Â  Cristina's wheels were tacoed and fork totally trashed, but luckily she was not seriously hurt.Â  We sat there for a while, trying to figure out what to do when a spectator came up and loaned Cristina his bike so we could coast to the finish.Â  I ended up going to an Austrian hospital for x-rays of my ribs and knee and getting my elbow doctored up.Â  Luckily my ribs were just bruised.  A couple of days later with about 30 K to go, Cristinas bike seat comes off.Â  we stopped a few times trying to get it back on, but it was damaged in the crash and she ended up taking it off and riding the last part of the race (which was luckily down-hill and a little flat) without a seat.Â  It was pretty funny!  We ended up in 4th place in the women's category. There were some really good competition, with a German team taking first, and Leslie and Gretchen from Rocky Mountain getting second.Â  The weather was great, except for rain the last day, and the scenery was awesome.Â  All the little towns in Austria were so pristine, with perfect houses and flowers everywhere.  And the mountains were just amazing!!  My bike worked great and I didn't have to do any major maintenance exceptÂ  for washing it and lubing the chain. The shifting was perfect the whole time and the suspension worked great. Pretty amazing for a 8 day race.Â  I have always had shifting issues in the past, expecially in stage-races.Â  I also really like how the NRS Air climbs. Pretty important in the Alps, since some of the mountain passesÂ  are 25-30 K long.Â  There was actually a little more single-track this year, which was fun, but could be frustrating at times.  There seemed to be a ton of people who were walking and wouldn't move to the side when you wanted to pass.  I guess the European men don't like to be beat by girls :-)  Looking forward to the trans-rockies next!

      Gooood Morning!  Looks to be a good day!  Right now I am wasting some time before work surfing the net and chugging down a steamy pot of the liquid black bean, a.k.a. black goodness, a.k.a coffee.   I surf the net too much, cause I don't own a TV or furniture.  So in my apartment it's just me, my bikes, and my G5........Is that how all bike racers / shop junkies live?  Yesterday was an alright day on the bike.  I went out in the pouring drizzle (not rain, drizzle.) and put in 3 hours on the road bike keeping the heartrate at a nice 130-150 bpm.  I felt good, and I hope I am good to go for tonights Thursday night road group ride.  My rides have been highly motivated lately.  I am pumped for 24 Hours of 9 Mile and World's.  Winning is the ONLY option for 24-9.  I just hope everything comes together to make that happen.  My goal for World's is the podium, which would be top 10, and I feel that that is do-able.   Looks like the entire Cateye Enduro Team will be at World's also.  That's awesome, cause I would like to meet my teammates at some point in the season.  I am thinking that the entire team can make it on the podium.  I came to the conclusion last night that the hardest part about World's is not going to be the race itself, but rather the 29 hour drive out there.  I think I will pull off the 29 Hours to Whistler, and try to do it Solo.   Riiiiiiight!  One other quick note.  I am now able to Audioblog which means I can call in my blog over the phone and then it will post it on this site in MP3 format.  I think I will take advantage of that at World's.  Anyway, it's time to replenish my mug with the black goodness, and start thinking about going to work.

      If any of you that are reading this have raced the 24 Hours of Moab, I am wondering what tire set up you ran?  Brand?  Size?  Knob size?  Air pressure?  Etc.  Just starting to plan out the Moab trip.  I have ridden at Slick-Rock, but I know that the course is way south of town and there is a crap load of sand, and not much slickrock.  Any suggstions would be great.

        urlLink        urlLink Cateye Stadium 3     Originally uploaded by  urlLink kerkovej .     STATS: The Stadium 3 is still the brightest bicycle headlight. A 12-volt NiMH battery connects to the top tube mounting ballast, which boosts the charge to 6000 volts, producing the equivalent of 80+ watts of halogen light. The Stadium 3 has a run time of 3 hours, and charge time of 3 hours with CatEye's quick-charger.   BEST THING: It's super bright!  Don't look straight into it or you will burn a hole straight through your head.  Runs for 3 hours and charges in 3 hours.  The light that is given off is white, so everything is seen in "true" color  WORST THING: This light consists of 3 items: light, ballast, and battery.  That is a lot of stuff to carry.  It is a bit heavier than most lights available now.  Takes up a water bottle cage.    MY VERDICT: This is the best light I have used to date.  You will have no problem seeing where you are going.  The only thing I don't like is the size.  If there was a way to roll the ballast and battery into one small pack that does not take up an H2O cage that would be swell.  Better yet....make it into a helmet mount with a battery the size of the existing ballast that would fit in your jersey pocket.   On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the best) I would give this light a 10 for light output and a 6 for its bulky size.

        urlLink        urlLink The Pit Crew....of One.     Originally uploaded by  urlLink kerkovej .     I have been requested by a number of people who have sent me e-mails to give out some of my "pit stop" tips.  Well, here are a few that ALL endurance racers should follow, unless your name is Chris Eatough.  If that's the case, you have it nailed down, and I wish I was as cool as you are :-)  HOW LONG OF PIT STOPS?  During 12 Hour races my longest stops are generally around 15 seconds or less.  12 hour races are run-and-gun, so there is no time to waste.   During 24 hour events, the same goes.  If I have a lead, I might take a bit more time.  To be successful at these events you have to keep moving forward whether it's at 2 mph or 30 mph.  DO YOU CHANGE CLOTHING?  During 12 hour events I can get through an entire event in the same shorts and jersey.  If it rains or the conditions change, then i will swap out top and bottoms if the competition allows. In 24 hour events I will switch clothing at the half-way point if I can (that's if the competition is not close).  Once again, conditions such as rain, heat, and yes snow will lead to many changes of clothing.  WHO HELPS?  My parents do an awesome job.  My mom (look at the nice picture) does most of my fueling and cooking.  For 24 hour events you need atleast 2 people to crew, and for 12 hour events I have been able to get by with one.  I have 2 bikes, so I don;t have a mechanic at every race.  At major raecs I have a bike junkie friend who come along to play mister fix-it.  SOME TRICKS:  To make things easy on my crew, I lay out the pit the same at every race.  I also have a dry-erase board that I write down what I need per lap (what drink mixes, what E-cap products, etc).  This is done before the race.  Keeping your pit crew informed makes things run smooth like nice warm butter.  I am also very organized.  I have all my clothing in one container, all my food in one container, my lights in one container, and cooking and general supplies in one container.  That way there is no searching for everything. One final note.  Eat and drink while riding,  keep the servings about hand size so you can take it with you and eat/drink it as you start your next lap.  I hope this helps.  If you have more specific questions e-mail or post.  Rage On!

I have now been converted!  I have done 5 hour mountain bike rides in 80-90 degree heat, and this pack keeps my water nice and chilled.  There is enough room to carry food, tools, hand pump, and extra clothing.  There is enought room to strap on your pet dog in need be (well....not really).  I used this at the 24 hours of Rapelje for the entire race and never had issues with it.  It has good features and awesome durability and comfort.

      Howdy!  Well, Saturday was interesting. It was the day that my story ran in the regional newspaper. I was plastered all over the front page of the Sports Section in full color. I also worked at the shop yesterday after my ride, and had people coming in asking to talk to "the guy who rides a lot." They mentioned the shop and my sponsors in the story, so people knew where to find me, and they were very interrested in Cateye products. Looks like Cateye's marketing dollars are hard at work. Here is the link for the story. Just copy and paste it into your browser .   urlLink http://www.wcfcourier.com/articles/2004/08/  01/sports/local/40bcccb655d6315d86256ee2001cbc29.txt  Yesterday, was also another WEMS race (www.wemseries.com) Looks as if my competition is still raging. Way to turn out 34 laps Scott Cave! It must have been a "hampster" course. Are you dizzy? Also, local Iowa new comer, Sean Noonan raged to a 3rd place! That is awesome, cause I think that is his first Endurance event. I better watch my back, and stop sharing my training secrets with him over e-mail. As for me, I am getting ready for 24 Hours of 9 Mile in 2 weeks. I have Monday off, so that means only one thing.....Long ass ride. I thinkg I might hit up the road bike and push the wind. We'll just have to see.  Well, that's about it. I am going out for an easy 3 hour ride with a co-worker, and then it's back to the shop to be "that guy who rides a lot."
