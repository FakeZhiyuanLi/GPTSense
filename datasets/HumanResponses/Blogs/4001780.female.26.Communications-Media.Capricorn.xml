						   Upon arriving at my gym, energetic and feeling wonderful about myself as I am about to exercise and thus become very healthy, my first concern turns to how I will avoid getting more-naked-than-I'd-like-to-be in the locker room.   When I was younger and went to sleep-away camp, I remember counselors telling us not to worry about being naked in the shower, the cabins. "The more you try to hide yourself the more people will try to look!" they'd say. True, for teetering wildly in the corner of the room with one arm through a t-shirt and the other carefully covering both barely-there breasts did, indeed, invite attention.   Now, safely through those harsh adolescent years, I've learned to love my body as all should. Sure, there are things I think about changing, times when I'd like to shed a few pounds, but I'm certainly not ashamed.   Nor am I bashful in the right situations. Nudity has never been an absolute no-no for me. Skinnydipping with friends in the right situations is absolutely delightful.   But still, I just cannot bring myself to bare it all in the locker room.   For some, I'm beginning to think this activity rivals the actual exercising in terms of importance. I'm not kidding.   Just recently, I emerged from the bathroom area, dressed and ready to go, to discover a 50-something woman standing in front of the full-length mirror with high heels on doing her make up. Just high heels.   I quickly turned away, mouth agape. Did she want me to adore her ample breasts? Her bare behind?   I know one is supposed to feel completely comfortable in the locker room. We are all ladies and we are all there to get more in touch with our bodies through the various realms of "getting in shape" so why not get a little naked beforehand? No one is looking.   I beg to differ. I am looking. And not on purpose, either, I just can't help it.   Some wave their hair freely under the hand dryer, bending over to get it just right, as they gab away with friends - bare ass naked.   Some traipse around gleefully, their shirt just covering the fact that they've got nothing on underneath; others wear a towel carefully draped to protect people from seeing their bottom half, their top half swinging before my eyes.   It's an interesting situation, and one I have started to grow used to. For the most part, these brave women are older than me, and I do think that has something to do with it. Naked? In front of strangers? Who cares? They've lived longer than me, and I'm guessing their knowledge in that department is far greater than mine.  I have progressed to the point where I can take my shirt off without looking around wildly to see who's nearby. I can stand, calmly, while I remove one bra and put on the other, because trying to create a intricate method of doing both at the same time just made me look pathetic.   Depsite the fact that I am so shocked by the variety of nudity I see when I go to my gym, I must admit that I respect it as well - I respect them. Perhaps before I move away, or end my membership I, too, will join their ranks.   As I walk, naked, from the sink to the mirror to my locker, I will proudly glance at my naked companions, silently gaining their approval.   For the time being, I'm pleased with my slow progression. I will remain banked in wondrous disbelief at the bravery allowed and practiced behind closed doors in the locker room.

						      I arrive home after a day of hard work, which is not a complete oddity for me, but perhaps not the norm either, and my boyfriend is not home yet. This is the way it is. As a scientist, he puts in many hours to get desired results.     We have been cohabitating since the beginning of June, and what a great relief it is (after coming home alone day after day to a rather damp apartment, crowded with two dogs and a cat, me and an ugly tan rug) to know that someone will always be coming home to me, or might be already there.    Our differences in lifestyle - everyone's - generally take longer to interpret than the immediately exciting things we have in common. J and I first bonded over a discussion of a Yo La Tengo album in a weight room at a hotel after a wedding, in utter disbelief that we had not met previous to that night...    But we live together now, and I come home, and am hungry. We disucss, perhaps, dinner as an option, but J has a distant look in his eyes. He wanders from room to room, and since we live in a house the size of 7 or 9 of my old apartments, I stray from room to room too, but never quite keeping up and never quite knowing where he has gone. "Dinner?" I wonder aloud.       People come over to watch a movie. Nothing has been accomplished on the eating front, so two hours later, after placing cold beers in our friends' hands, J and I finally sit down to eat. We make something together.     While he is finishing I see the look and he mutters..."tired..." - he is adorable with very blue eyes and slightly messy dark hair. "Oh no," I say. "No." Because I know him and what is coming. He will fall asleep on the counter. He will fall asleep on the counter with all of his clothes on and when I try to move him he will say, "No baby, I'm not ready to go to bed yet." Really? Because falling asleep in whatever one's surroundings might be would indicate a sort of perpetual readiness for bed, wouldn't it?     I've seen this, I'm not kidding. He falls asleep in the car almost directly upon buckling up - when someone else is driving of course. On long drives he regularly bolts upright asking, "You ok, baby? Are you too tired to drive? Is everything ok?" and before I can answer, he's drifted off again, muttering nonsensical things.     I'm not one to stick to strict regimens, per se, but I do enjoy going to bed with the lights and television off, my pajamas on, and to have the person next to me stick to the same guidelines. J challenges me nightly, and I'm up for it.     We have grown, actually, to understand eachother's eccentricities. And as many times as I've had to yell "Take them out! CONTACTS OUT OF YOUR EYES!" or reached over to turn his light off to his surprise (Want to fall asleep with all your clothes and shoes on? Fine. That's what you get), there is something wonderful in waking up with him there, or having him come home after a late night and I've already fallen asleep.     I don't mind having someone to take care of - and I'm taken care of in return.     And the things in common still outweigh everything, perhaps the most overpowering the fact that we both like what we've got together. Spent an afternoon driving around recently, listening to some of our favorite music, singing out the windows, screaming even. Two peas in a pod. Two nightstands, two lamps. One on, one off.

						   Mina awakens me with a unique maneuver. She places her warm nine-pound body just so that I cannot move my neck or head without a look straight into her eyes. Her behind is in the air. The tail commences wagging. Mina wants to know what our plans for the day are.   She is brown. Mina has floppy little ears and curly tail. Her name was Brandy when she came to the Orange County animal shelter. She was stiff as a board and had been living in a car for some time with her family, who could not afford to keep her anymore. I hated this dog.   Brandy lived in the director's office once she came around a little and snarled at everyone who passed by, or even tried to bite their ankles. I agreed to take her home for a weekend because I am crazy.   But the morning after that first night in my apartment, Brandy appeared from under my bed, wagged her tail for approximately 2 seconds, and disappeared again. And I began, immediately, to love her. I changed her name and bought her sweaters.   Once she ate her weight in taco meat. Once she bounded up onto a friend's kitchen counter to consume seven chocolate cupcakes (with wrappers). She chases cats that are bigger than her.   Mina has a definite plan. It is refreshed every morning when we both wake up. Mina is charged and ready for the day. Her day consists of finding anything edible within her reach, as quickly and efficiently as she can. Her day consists of absolute adoration for the people she has let into her heart. Her day consists of, sometimes, letting someone new in.   She still likes to bark at newcomers, or neighbors who dare to walk anywhere near our house. I have another dog, too. A regular-sized dog who does normal dog things like chew bones and jump up in excitement when she meets new friends. Mina plays with her, but it always a very serious endeavor. They run around the house at top speed, trying to get various toys from eachother. Mina bites my normal dog's ankles. She always wins.

						   On the agenda tonight we have a plan to go out and rally the individuals we know in this little part of the world.   My friends and I, we've got terms. We reach out and touch base with all the usuals, attempting to gain the affirmative from each (thus bringing them into the circle), binding them with guilt, and gaining momentum. The emails and/or phone calls begin "who's ready?" and end with "I'm in!" as though we were volunteering for a fun, but intense activity, such as mucking horse stalls or&nbsp;holiday carol singing.   We plan with the fury of dragon-slayers, but when it gets right down to it, what we want is an evening without firmly-laid plans. Why? There are too many options. Who knows where we might end up...who we might meet out...what sort of moods we will be in.   In this ever-distracting world, I have met many interesting people, some of whom have become my close friends. At 26-years old, I can say I've made a place for myself in the world, here in North Carolina.   But I don't have school, or some other circular cycle to guide me to my next steps. Since college, I've quit every job that ceased being interesting. Without a plan, I'd fumble through somewhat empty days (one period of note consisted of obsessively&nbsp;making clear blue and green soap in the shapes of turtles and frogs) until something would come along.   There is a lot of waiting and deliberating. I've heard many of my friends wonder out loud what the next step should be. Graduate school? Getting married?&nbsp;But in the interim - which is, technically, all the time - there have been some very good stories.&nbsp;Regarding the nights with no agenda, the unexpected romances, the morning walks with the dog,&nbsp;or the chance meetings that happen every day I must confess that a lot is going on, already. &nbsp;   I've always enjoyed the every-day instances, anyway. It is there, unexpectedly, I think, that the most fascinating happenings occur. &nbsp;

						   Sick. Aching body and head, feeling weak, feeling so tired. I've cast off today as a productive one. However, while sitting making hot tea, the dogs perfect angels at my feet - almost as though they understand I need peace - and a lot of time on my hands, I went upstairs to retrieve four or five movies, in the hopes that I just might stay in bed until tomorrow.   But on my way back down, I paused and inspected some storage boxes in the hall. Several old journals were piled up in one, and I added them to the stack.   I've kept a diary since I was 10 when one was given to me as a present. Then I recorded the serious dramas of which teachers were strict and how much homework I had. Honestly, a good deal of page space was given to the woes of homework demands. I moved on to talking about, even talking to, boys, in my pre-teens.  Commentaries regaring three-way call tricks in which I'd call such and such, asked if he liked what's her name, what's her name being on the line the whole time without such and such knowing a thing. The brilliance of three way calling for teenage girls. That, along with an obsession with horseback riding. Pretty cool kid. These were the things I wrote about, and I wrote often.   As I got older, and especially in college, this habit tapered a bit. I suppose I found other things to do with my time. I've got some of the more recent journals here, and the whole collection at home. Amusingly, from the trouble with fourth-grade history to the search for a career in my early twenties, the journals remain consistent in their sparsity of detail and overabundence of emotion. I was...am constantly trying to figure things out, I suppose.   A few choice selections I thought I would share:   March 2, 1999 (I travelled abroad the semester before this had a rough time adjusting to life in Boston after my return)  I haven't felt very happy in a while. I've been back at school having a wonderful time. A great time. Except for the happiness issue.   July 18, 1999   Life Goals: -adopt a greyhound -live in Maine -be on the radio  October 20, 2001 (this was after I met J, but still living with the ex - at that time current - boyfriend)   Trivially, really, I want to become a little more in shape so these jeans don't feel so tight. More importantly, I'm going to need to make some major decisions.

						   It was a rainy weekend, but the boyfriend and I were happy to be stuck inside, rearranging our house in all sorts of ways. We got some Chinese lanterns to put up. We found a place for my newly-framed print from the Met. But most importantly, perhaps, was that despite the rain, J has found a new hobby.   I was peacefully reading on our living room couch late Friday afternoon when I received an urgent, “Baby LOOK!” from the front door. When I arrived outside J pointed out a praying mantis sitting in a flower bush, lazily munching on a dead butterfly. “Gross,” I told him, and I meant it. I’ve never liked those huge green bugs, with their jaunty gait and smug little faces. But for my boyfriend, this was the beginning of an adventure. This was the beginning of an education.   He quickly procured my digital camera and began not only taking pictures of this beautiful act of nature but also of a variety of other insects. He researched on the internet and was able to identify the “Hummingbird Moth” which imitates the actual bird, and the species of our plant, which attracts such a plethora of bugs.   And this was the weekend of all weekends for such a hobby to arise. The things that were in store!  A dead squirrel in the front yard sent J on a mission that yielded even more than he could have hoped. He had to get rid of the thing without me seeing it, thank the lord. And he did so in a very gentlemanly fashion, guiding me around the atrocity with hands over my eyes when I came outside.   But J’s disposal of the creature led him on an amazing search of the woods behind our house. After he’d done the job he forced (and I mean forced – I didn’t want to explore the rainy forest after the squirrel incident) me to come see the green meadow and “secret” path to the creek that runs behind our neighborhood.   It was easier, he concluded, to thrash through the woods than go down the street (a thirty-second trip) and access the creek the way everyone else does. In addition, he had taken a good number of pictures of the creek’s risen water level due to all the rain, documenting, once again, the wonders of nature.     He says he’ll be forging a way through the wilderness soon. For now I will continue to use the nice wooden stairs at the end of our block.   But the best was yet to come.   While moving a box from the garage into the kitchen, J suddenly exclaimed, jumped back, and his eyes grew wide when a tiny creature fell to the floor. A black widow spider, the real deal, had entered our household. He showed me the hourglass pattern on its back, and we looked up pictures on the web to confirm.   Spiders have never bothered me much, even this one, especially after reading that while black widow bites are rather unpleasant, they are rarely, if ever, fatal, and don’t tend to cause permanent damage. Besides, J had cleverly caught the thing under a glass on the floor.   Why? Pictures!   He got a number of good ones, cautioning me each time he left the room to view his snapshots on the computer that I should watch the dogs so they wouldn’t release the thing from its see-through confinement. Finally, after the wildlife was properly documented and saved on the computer, J killed our spider. I felt a little sad, it having been so brazenly used for our viewing pleasure, and so quickly disposed of. But then again, who wants a bite which invokes cramping pain and nausea?   Later on in the weekend (the specific timing of each unique find escapes me) I spotted another big spider (of the non-poisonous sort) in a gigantic web outside the front door. I had just gotten J to leave the house after a number of attempts – “Are you ready, yet? Ready to go, baby? I’m down here. I’m ready. Are you ready to go yet?” – when I, in a moment of poor judgment, pointed the insect out.   “Look,” I said.   Hushed silence. And then a long breath and quick response.   “I’ve GOT to go get the camera,” he said. Damnit.  But after several brilliant shots of the evil-looking spider suspended in its web, we were off, a rich catalogue of our experience in the residential neighborhoods of Carrboro now safely ensconced in J’s hard drive.   The next day, the huge spider, like the black widow and murdered butterfly before it, was gone. Luckily, we’ve got the pictures to prove it. There is, I admit, a good deal of interesting wildlife all around our new digs. I saw a snake on the sidewalk when walking the dog the other day and failed to tell J until several hours later.   This was a mistake, marked by a look of utter confusion, and of course the question, “Why didn’t you tell me?”

						   He was absolutely the most suave man anybody had ever met. Dressed all in black, with a silver bottle opener tucked neatly into his faux-leather belt, the bartender made his rounds, checking on customers as if each were the only one in the place. It was quiet, for a Thursday night, but he would not let one drink go empty, one pretty girl's cigarette go unlit. He walked with a slight swagger and spoke in smooth, one or two word phrases like, "Oh yeah?" (with a mischeivous smile) or "Nice," used to punctuate a funny story. Sometimes he would wink after that one. "Niiiicceee." Wink. That's how you get the girls.   The above is a hopeful description - as in one I'm sure the actual bartender in question might have hoped for. He would see no tinge of sarcasm in this description. In fact, to make fun of this bartender to the point where he noticed it would, I'm sure, bring about pain too harsh for me to even think about. The strange thing is, I like this guy.   Last night after a few beers a friend and I decided it was time for a glass of wine, and an inevitable headache the next day (which did, on schedule, arrive). We chose the aptly named "Pub" for its charming decor. Christmas lights hang outside around a plastic covered dining area. The inside is smoky and "mysterious" with a bar surrounded by several tables and booths. On our only other trip to this pub my friend and I had planted ourselves at the bar right about where we ended up last night.   Again, the conversation with friendly strangers was effortless. We talked about fishing with our new best friend to the right, a gentleman who inspired the subject when he produced a picture of himself with a monstrous fish he had caught. To the group in back of us, more our age, the conversation was one of casual shouts more than anything really meaningful. "Drink!" "Woo!" Stuff like that.   My friend and I, experts in the art of baring our innermost thoughts and worries when out together, interspersed our deep dialouge with observations of our magical surroundings. Fake pine-tree vines climbed about the bar and over liquor bottles. "Is it Christmas?" I asked the bartender, probably one too many times - two times, being too many.   The bartender laughed though. His nonchalance about the place brutally clear; he made it so. The food? Not so good. The crowd? Pretty tame tonight. The red wine? May have been uncorked several weeks ago. His mission was clear. This was an ultra hip bartender in a mediocre bar - or at least, this was the persona being thrown in my face - "thrown," of course, in an extremely subtle way. This was his way.   He had an act. He had his black shirt tucked in neatly and his hair styled. He really did look after his customers, the bartender, and although he mentioned  several  times that this was an unusually small crowd, I got the feeling he liked it that way.   But I liked him. I liked this bartender because he made me feel cool. He made me feel like my friend and I, having our late night glass of red wine and deep, neverending talks, were special. He made me feel justified in making fun of the Christmas decorations in August. He made me feel like I could just go this bar alone, sit, and spill my worries, because that was his job - to listen - as the bartender.   I probably won't do that.   The last time my friend visited this particular "Pub" the bartender was a different sort. He was wearing safety goggles and encouraging us to attend '80's night. When we inquired about this other bartender and the famed "'80's night" to Mr. Suave, he scoffed at his competing co-worker, muttering something like, "Sure, he's always got some crazy thing going on..."  For last night there was no talk of Dixie's Midnight Runners or The Cars. Last night was about a mysterious man all in black who provided us with a hip attitude in a Christmas-decorated pub in a strip mall, a chance to talk, and red wine that had been opened for the least amount of time.

						   Dear Mr. King,   It is with great regret that I write to inform you I will no longer be reading any of your acclaimed works. This is made all the more regrettable as I have only read one of your books in the first place.   My recent experience with _The Stand_ left me restless, unproductive, and angry. Please let me explain.   It was with excitement that my boyfriend handed me the book, even after my proclamation that I did not like books about "horror and magic" etc. "This one's not like that," he said.   I began my experience enjoyably enough. I've always had a soft spot for incurable life destroying illnesses that produce large amounts of bodily fluids aptly described by an author or witness. Each time someone around me would cough or sneeze, I'd mutter "Captain Trips?" under my breath, sharing a delightful little private joke with myself.   The first inklings of my personal horror were innocent-seeming. I started wondering, from time to time, what I would do should the world be suddenly unpopulated, only a few souls to cling to, and rotting corpses all around me. I dreamt about it, sure, but the thought did not take over my regular lifestyle. Not yet.   I had a free weekend. Here in North Carolina, the summer days are filled with excellent activities such as cocktail drinking, swimming in the pool and taking leisurely walks. But I decided to stay indoors, all weekend, and read your book. Did I mention it was the unabridged version? Thank you so much for rereleasing that monster with so many additional pages of utter despair and completely dense paragraphs. And come to think of it, perhaps I should reword my above sentence, "decided to stay indoors." It was not a decision, but a mandatory demand placed upon me by my own, wearily addicted brain.   It was not long into my weekend-long reading frenzy that I started to actually physically worry about Frannie's baby. I drifted in and out of sleep on the couch in our living room (my night's sleeping disturbed, now, by thoughts concerning the future of the human race).   Harold Lauder danced through my fitful naps. If only he had tried a bit harder. The "dark man" sat upon my chest, asking, over and over again, why not choose the devil? And I endlessly compared Mother Abigail to a real 113 year-old woman I had recently met who remarkably fit her description. Had I met a messiah and let the experience slip through my fingers? I didn't know anymore. My dreams were filled with questions I could not answer. What would I do? Who would I choose? How would I deal? How much grief can be forced upon one society?   There were more uplifting sections, of course. I enjoyed greatly Glen's sarcastic wit. The dog, Kojak, was a phenomenal creature, and I projected Kojak-like expectations on my own pets. If I were dying, slowly, in the wilderness, would you bring me a dead rabbit, and wood to build a fire? Their answers were blank, questioning stares. More pertinently, I'm sure they were thinking, why have you not fed or walked us? Maybe you should get off the damn couch?   Characters in the book starting wetting their pants or puking on what seemed like every other page. Other worldly occurrences began to take place. Mixed in with the cast of every day Americans, there was now a hint of what I commonly think of when I hear your name, Mr. King. Good and Evil. Randall Flagg smiles and birds drop dead off telephone wires.   I finished the novel Sunday evening. I was left tired and questioning. Things never change, do they? The policemen want to be armed. Humans make the same mistakes again and again. And I still couldn't get out of my head the image of a United States covered with rotting corpses. Larry Underwood and the tunnel scene. I  had  to make myself answer the question...would I have been able to do it? Would I have been able to walk through that dark space of death?   I suppose this is the problem. Somehow, with your talent, you got me too involved. I knew a little too much about the situation to deem it imaginary. And so, I believed and had to face the possibility myself.   It was only upon reading the last words that I was able to free myself from the grasp of _The Stand_. And even that night there were a few more dreams. But upon entering my house from the porch, after thankfully closing the book forever, I found my boyfriend getting ready for dinner. We ate real food (not sustenance from cans due to an electricty shortage brought on by a rapidly spreading lethal disease). Neighbors and their children walked through the streets. This is my world.   The characters in your novel faced a great adventure and learned about themselves and the human race while they were at it. I'm glad I had you, and them, to describe it to me and take over my every waking thought for several days. But I'm glad to be back. I like my hairdryer. I like my shelter from the winter snow. The doctor's office.   Am I grateful for the experience? Somewhat. But I'm taking a break, for good if I can, from your wonderful writing, Mr. King. You have enough readers as it is, and apparently my imagination can't handle so realistic a portrayal of destruction and redemption through holy signs.   Don't get me wrong. You have my admiration - absolutely. We just see things differently. If I want pessimistic philsophy in the future, I think I'll just pick up some Nietzsche. I'll probably nod off quickly after doing so, and enjoy deep, dreamless sleep.   One more thought - I know you are from Maine and include the state in many of your works, including _The Stand_. My family and I have always chosen the Maine coast as a vacation destination. Now, when passing through the quaint towns, I will probably look beyond the seagulls and ice cream stands, the wild blueberries, and thriving wilderness, to a deeper, darker remembrance of ghastly and demonic plague-inflicted death. Thank you for that.   Respectfully yours,   Cara Maria Rotondaro
