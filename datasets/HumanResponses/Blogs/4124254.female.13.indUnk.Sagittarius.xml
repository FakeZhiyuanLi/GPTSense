      Sorry I haven't been posting in a while, back to school stuff! I thought it would be cool if I answered all of the questions everyone has posted!  garyg said . . . .Can you post some advice on how to encourage kids to become interested in politics? My 12-year-old daughter (I won't name her but maybe you know her!) shows no interest. How can she become more like you? Do your parents get some credit for your knowledge?. . . . . . . . . My parents have gotten me into politics , by watching the news, and talking about issues at dinner! role plays out. Whatever happens, I'm with W! the 2000 election came around I was happy to know a little bit more than my classmates! But politics isn't everyone's thing! I love politics but so many kids my age take for granted the fact we get to choose our leaders! I always encourage speaking out at school and stuff, that's another thing that got me into politics!  garyg also said. . . . . Don't you think it would have been cool if the two candidates had "run into each other" on the street in Davenport and had a spontaneous debate? Or maybe just an arm-wrestling contest. I think George W would have won. . . . . . . Oh yeah! George Bush would have won both the arm wrestle and the debate!  Maryrose said. . . . . . . This issue is a good example of how President Bush can compromise and work with the Congress. As a former intelligence officer, I did not like the 9/11 Commission's proposal to have another Director of Central Intelligence--in my thinking, there is one already in place. The DCI is the head of the CIA and coordinates all other intell agencies. So, my reaction was much like the President's. BUT I see his decisions to have a new director as good leadership: Bush will work with those he doesn't necessarily agree with. I was a bit surprised, though, at the specifics of the President's proposal...we'll see how the new director role plays out. Whatever happens, I'm with W! . . . . . . With all do respect, I think the Central intelligence Director was a good idea! This way the two agencies can collaborate information with eachother!  Bob said. . . . .If Kerry thinks that fighting back against terrorism causes more terrorism, how does he explain the terrorism of the 1990s -- the first World Trade Center bombing, Khobar Towers, the African embassies -- when the U.S. did nothing to fight back?. . . . . I completely agree!  jke sent this awesome article about John Kerry's short biography at the democratic convention! He actually re - shooted scenes from the Vietnam war!  Maryrose said. . . Interesting you mention Kerry's four months in Viet Nam. I was chatting with my Mom, and she was amazed by this intelligence. (My late Dad was a USMC Captain during Viet Nam, and served one tour in DaNang.) Mom said most military served two tours--she was aghast that Kerry had served such a short time. We told her that after receiving three Purple Hearts, a soldier or sailor can request a transfer of duty station...and Kerry did. Yes, he was heroic, but does this qualify him to be Commander in Chief? (I can't dismiss his "Viet Nam Veterans against the war" efforts, either.). . . . . . I heard that veterans who served with Kerry said he stayed in Vietnam until all his campaigns material was shot. . . . . I think that's hilarious!  Thankyou for commenting on my posts!

      The polls have been going crazy! To many's surprize Bush's approval rate went up after the Democratic convention. Newsweek's polls are like aroller coaster! In july, Newsweek showed George Bush ahead! This month, they show a narrow poll, but this time with the democrats ahead. Bush is doing pretty well. His highest 88%, lowest 47% and the average for 2004 so far exactaly 50%. Some of his best aproval rates were right after 911, where people actualy were united (didn't last too long) instead of critisizing Bush, like they are now.

      Oh no! President George and democratic candidate John Kerry, seem to have run into eachother on the campaign trail. Today the two are with in a quarter-mile of eachother in Davenport, Iowa. Iowa, normally votes democratically. A local news station, KWQC-TV plans to cover  both  candidates! And if that isn't enough,Vice president, Dick Cheney and John Kerry both plan to speak in southern Misouri at the same time! They will be making an appearance to primary voters. Just hope that nothing goes wrong!

      Democratic candidate John Kerry has accused President Bush of encouraging terrorist recruitment with polices that "make the world angry." Kerry made this ridiculous statement on the day that President Bush announced that he would create a national ineligence czar and a counterterrorisim center, as suggested by the 911 commission. George Bush dismised this comment,for the same reasons americans should, its just stupid!

      Monday President Bush said he strongly supported the 911 commission's idea to create the position of the national intelligence director. A head director of both the CIA and the FBI. Democratic candidate, John Kerry, told his supporters that he would follow the 911 commission's suggestions, if elected president. But now he is criticizing President Bush  for  considering the commission's ideas!(huh??) Well despite his toughest critics, President Bush is working extremely hard to keep America, and according to me he is doing an extremely great job!

      The Democratic convention was over- all successful, if you don't count the overwhelming star power, the constant "Bush bashing" and the creepy speech made by Teresa Heinz Kerry. But if you ask me, John Kerry's speech was not all that it was cracked up to be. The senator started his address with the cheesy line "I am John Kerry, reporting for duty!"First he accused the Bush campain of being too negative in their advertising he also had a-lot of bush bashing throughout his speech. A great example of the saying "do as I say, not as I do." Of course it would not have been an official John Kerry speech without some talk of his heroic deeds in the Vietnam War. Though which I have recently found out that his service in Vietnam was only four months and twelve days. Most soldiers served atleast a year and a half. If you ask me, John Kerry's acceptance speech was neither informative nor persuasive. It basically glossed over the many statements of Democrats in the past year.
