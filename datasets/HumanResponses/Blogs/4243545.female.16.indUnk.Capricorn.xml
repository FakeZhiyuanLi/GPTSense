      So now that I have decided to join this blog, live journal, whatever you wanna refer to it as...well. I have jumped aboard the online bandwagon, as it were. Eh, jumping is always fun, as long as it's done in the proper context. Into an active volcano, while my choice of death, would not be my choice of jumping. Bandwagong jumping is much less...lava-y.  I bet you're all wondering how my day went. Hmm...another exciting day in the life o Jen! I went to church, which was boring as usual. Can you say, brainwashing? Sigh. And since 2 out of the 3 cars at my house are at the shop, my dad had to drive me. Which meant I couldn't duck out early and actually do something constructive with my time...I had to just sit there...and watch Sister Vivian sing. Or attempt to sing, depending on how tone deaf you are. Afterwards, comes the exciting part. My newly acquired boyfriend, Paul, has been playing drums in a musical, "Pippin" In case you are not familiar, it's the same guy who wrote "Godspell". In case your STILL not familiar, both plays are just gigantic acid trips. Back to the whole Paul thing...I saw him play drums, and he was good. My God was he good. He is extremely talented in just about everything musical. The only qualm I have about our relationship, is that things might be moving to fast. Physically, I mean. He's the only guy I've moved this fast with...although he is the guy I've known the longest...but still. And he takes it in such little steps, that seperate they're ok...but I don't know. I know he's not doing it intentionally, he'd never do it intentionally, but we're moving awwwful fast. Scary thing is that I like it. Oh, one other qualm, if I may. There is *gasp* another girl. Lauren, his first kiss. She graduated last year, and she's moving to California, but under those circumstances I can see where he would not be completely over her. I simply can't compete with a phantom in California...she'll always be the same in his heart. I'm always worried he's comparing me to her, during our conversations, our kissing, even just walking. *green eyed monster flares* Yeah. So we'll see how that goes.  Then I went for a run! I wish I was skinny. I know everrrryone and their mother says that, but I really do need to lose this weight. I hate girls who can eat everything and still weigh nothing. Don't get the point wrong and think I'm all superficial...I just wish I could be more sure of myself.  One final thought...CREAM SODA!
