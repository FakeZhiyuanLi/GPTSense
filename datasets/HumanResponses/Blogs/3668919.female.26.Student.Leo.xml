      So here is my second entry.  I am feeling so discouraged today.  I am so tired of dieting.  I have been watching my calorie intake since May 31st and my weight hasn't budged.  I then early this week dropped my intake down from 1480 to 1300 and I gained a pound.  How discouraging.  I have been pretty faithfully exercising, at least 4 times a week and have been so good and careful about what I eat and I feel that I am at a stand still.  I mean come on, I only want to lose another 7 lbs. you'd think I needed to lose 100!  Plus as good as it felt to exercise yesterday I so over did it.  My neck and shoulders just ache, but I know I cannot give in.  I need to get out there tonight and get my butt moving.  On a different subject, would you believe this weekend I have to work at my other job both Saturday & Sunday from 7am-4pm.  WTF was my boss thinking.  As it is I work my day job M-F 8am-5pm, then I have school two nights a week.  Then she gives me the morning shift BOTH days of the weekend.  I am going to absolultey die.  Oh well, while the rest of the world is enjoying their day, I will be working my life away.  Jenny

      Well here is my first blog, how exciting.  Anyway the goal of this blog is to keep progress of my healthy living, healthy eating, lose a few pounds goals.    Today I weighed in at 154 lbs.  My first goal is to hit 148 lbs.  My second goal is to hit 145 lbs. My last goal is to hit 142 lbs.  My overall goal is to maintain a weight of 142-145 lbs.    I have been a yo-yo dieter my entire life, and frankly I am tired of it.  My latest relationship ended leaving me at a plump 172 lbs.  I started my current diet in the last two weeks of February 2003.  Previous to this relationship I was 142-145, and previous to that in a past relationship weighed in at a hefty 184 lbs, so as you can see relationships are disaterous to me.  My goals are to exercise 5-6 times a week.  Currently it's been more like 4-5 times a week.  My ideal work out schedule would be 3 days cardio, 3 days strengh training with a day off rest. (Well not really rest, the day I'd have off of working out would be every Sunday in which that day I spend 7-8 hours on my feet caring for animals as a vet tech)  My goal for eating habits are to for one consume more water.  I am currently up to 3-4 16.9 oz bottles a day and would like to increase it to 4-5 bottles a day.  I also would like to incorporate more fruits and veggies into my diet.  Another factor or problem for me is before bed time binging.  I don't know why it is but something about watching late night TV in your jammies makes your tummy summon the fridge.  My current calorie allowance for the day is 1300-1380 (down from 1480 last week)  I am sort of at a plateau and need to get this weight loss moving again.  I also try to eat five fruits/veggies a day.  My goal is to look good in my new bikni that I purchased when I was 168 lbs.  Sure I guess it's procrastination but hell look where I've gotten so far.  My goal is to at least look good in it by early to mid August.  Well perhaps I shall wrap this up.  Jenny
