      I'd like to start off by saying congratulations on the Birth of Jesus (pbuh). Hmm, according to the Gregorian calendar at least.   It's strange, but sometimes I feel as if, I don't know...as if the people close to me don't make Islam their priority like it should be. For example, if I tell them that something they're doing is negative, they'd tell me to stop being such a "party pooper" and to enjoy life because it doesn't last. I firmly believe that I'm not being anal. When I stress to them that this life's pleasures that they lean towards so protectively are temporary and the Hereafter is ultimately what we live for, they look down on me once again. They go on about how they do try their best, and that they're good Muslims. Selecting and following what is only convenient to you isn't sufficient enough, and neither is believing that you're simply a good Muslim. What exactly is a "good" Muslim anyway? It's unbelievably discouraging, and I start to lose faith in them although I probably shouldn't because in the end, Allah (SWT) will judge them.   The other day, I started discussing niqaab with a certain someone and how she'd react if I started. I don't believe I'm seriously going to start any time soon, but I was interested in talking about it since I wanted to hear her take on it. Although I wasn't expecting her to wholeheartedly encourage me, she went on about how it's ridiculously "extreme" and completely unnecessary, much to my dismay. I remembered how this was the same person who used to nag me about going to pray, and now it's me who encourages her to go pray. It's strange. I guess people just change and I feel helpless around them because there's almost nothing more that I can do to make a difference.   There was another instance and although it is kind of irrelevant to what I'm talking about, it had me thinking. I was talking to a cousin of mine and he mentioned that he usually avoids to pray or read the Qu'ran. I asked him why he felt that way and his response was that he has screwed up countless times in the past and that praying or reading the Qu'ran will simply remind him of the consequences. People tend to forget and go on sinning with the belief that it's useless to stop and ask for forgiveness. They believe that there's no way whatsoever that they can be forgiven. I stated to him that even if he has committed a thousand sins, if he truly repents with his heart and compensates for it, Allah (SWT) will surely forgive him by erasing his previous sins forever and letting him start from scratch. Hence this verse, "O My slaves who have wronged their souls, do not despair of Allah's mercy, for Allah will forgive all the sins. He is indeed very Forgiving, very Compassionate, Turn to Him then, and obey Him (in all your affairs)." (Al-Zumar:53,54)   In school, I don't have any Muslim friends whatsoever. I can't exactly blame myself considering my school's Muslim population is sadly non existent. Maybe an acquaintance, but I believe that that is all she'll ever be to me, an acquaintance. I'm not saying that my non-Muslim friends are of no importance to me, because they definitely are. They're amazing people who have shaped who I am as a person. Outside of school are my family, relatives, and only a few friends from my masjid. Nevertheless, no one from the people around me has actually influenced me in an Islamic way, if you know what I mean. I can honestly say that the people that I know online (yes, I'm talking about you, the Blogistanis!) have made the greatest impact on me by constantly inspiring and motivating me to do more. I'm anticipating college because I know the Muslim population there will not be scarce. Insha'Allah, I hope to meet people who have a positive influence on my iman.   I had typed this entry up early yesterday but I didn't want to post it just then. I figure I will now although I know I went off on a lot of tangents throughout my entry, heh. My mom's brownies are calling to me at the moment. Ciao, all!

      Ahh, break has officially begun! Twelve whole days of pure freedom. My friends and I had originally planned to go celebrate and eat out for dinner but I decided that I'd rather not. I don't know, I just don't feel like going for some odd reason. I hate how I feel so inactive and dormant lately. Scratch that...not lately, but for as long as what seems the past couple of months. It's strange but I guess I'll have to push myself to spend a little more time with my friends and "socialize" a bit more than I usually do.   This Friday is my cousin's one year wedding anniversary party at a restaurant in New York City so I'm really looking forward to that. It'll be awesome seeing all my family together considering that the last time I had a chance to see everyone was on Eid, which was nearly a month ago. Whoah, that day seems like it was months ago. Hmm, and next week we'll be going down to Virginia to stay at my dad's aunt's house for a few days. We were there back in March and I had a blast, so it should be fun.   Hmm, some things have been kind of irritating me lately. It's frustating that my friends and I nearly always talk about the most trivial of things. We almost never engage in deep or meaningful conversations. It's sad because I have so much that I'd love to talk about and discuss but never get a chance to actually do so because my friends are never interested to say the least. It's not that I don't make the initiative, because I do. I guess not everyone will have the oppurtunity to possess friends that they can talk to about anything and everything. There's tons that I keep bottled up inside that I'd probably never disclose to anyone, which is extremely nervewracking.   Yesterday, I was talking to three of my friends and somehow, something that had occured two years ago was brought up. I won't explain the situation because it's long and hard to really describe, but it was something that completely effected the level of trust that I had had in my three friends. To this day, I find it hard to fathom that they did what they had did, and to be reminded about it again yesterday was just too much. Funny thing is, I never had a chance to honestly confront my friends about it. Well, I did confront them but I didn't make it a point to let them know that it had in fact, hurt the trust that I had for them and along with that, our friendships. Heh, this was two years ago. Well, since it was brought up yesterday by someone other than me, I stressed how low it was of them. My friend blurted out, "well, what was it to you?" Haha, what was it to me? Oh man, don't even get me started. I started telling her about how manipulative it was of them but my third friend stepped in and told us that since it was two years ago, we should just forget about it and move on. I know that she's absolutely right, but I'm not the one who brought it up and delved into it. When I'm told that something so unimaginably wrong was nothing of importance to me, I'm obviously going to say something in my defense rather than sit there like a log. Eh well, whatever. I just had to vent because no one that I know in person would want to hear me talk about it. Thanks guys.

      It's actually Thursday night but I'll have to post this later when Blogger isn't down any longer and that will possibly be tomorrow. I just read over my entry from Sunday and I have to admit that I did overreact a tad bit. I mean, so what if one person put me down like he did? It doesn't change the truth in any way whatsoever and at the end, it only matters if Allah knows the facts. I suppose I did get a bit carried away since I tend to be extremely sensitive when it comes to people interfering in my personal life, but then again, who isn't?   We left for Virginia on Tuesday afternoon and returned home about an hour or so ago. It's nine thirty at the moment. I guess that explains for my lack of entries and comments on blogs, huh? I had the greatest time bonding with my cousins and my one year old cousin, Marya, is the most adorable kid ever! My other cousins Noorallah, a five year old, and Yadullah, a twelve year old, are just as awesome. It really is a shame that I see them so rarely. Hmm, we visited the Air and Space Museum yesterday which was surprisingly interesting and we all enjoyed it. Their house is simply gorgeous and it's so large that you can actually get lost in it. Haha, if I lived in Virginia, I'd be going over to their house everyday! Overall, I'm glad we went. I was a bit reluctant to want to go for some reason that I don't even know myself. I'm certainly looking forward to going back! It's funny how I had so much to blog about when I was there but I never found the opportunity since I was almost always with Marya. I would have described our short trip in much more detail than I did if it weren't for me being as tired as I am. Wording my thoughts is becoming harder by the second and I swear my brain is dying on me. Agh.  So the new year has finally began. I'm quite indifferent but there definitely is a considerable lot that I want to accomplish this year. There are a few things that I desire to change about myself but I'm not sure what exactly are the chances of that happening. I always promise myself to commit to a certain goal and carry it out but it almost never becomes reality. Thinking about that is somewhat depressing but oh well.   I can't forget the fact that many, many events, both positive and negative, have taken place during the past year. Certain people that I love very much have left me and this world but fortunately, I have gotten over this and life is going on. It's Allah's mercy that internal pain tends to soften as time passes. I've changed drastically in the past year and it's strange how we usually don't notice changes but I really do feel as if much about me has changed. I believe that my faith has strengthened and I'm a better Muslimah now than I was a year from now. What's important is that I started wearing hijab on August 23, 2003...that date will probably always remain imprinted in my mind! If someone had told me even a year from now that I would start, I wouldn't have believed it even for a second. Additionally, I know that I am now much more aware of my environment and the people that are around me...it's as if I've come to have the ability to see right through people. This helps me to a great extent because I have better judgment when it comes to who I should or should not befriend. I turn out to be right nearly all of the time. I've became closer to a select group of people and I know that we'll become even better friends in the future. Also, I've became a regular on the Muslim blogging scene, hehe. I think I created my first actual blog in the April of this year which seriously seems as if it were decades ago and not this year. I mean, I've had other blogs in the past but I can only really count this once since it's the most personal. It's been such a great privilege to come across the people that I have online. I can honestly go on forever about what has happened this year but I figure I'll stop now because my brain seems to not be functioning anymore! Then again, when is it ever? ;)

      The one thing that I absolutely can't stand is when people can't admit they're wrong. I was having a conversation with my cousin today and the whole time she kept going on and on about how I'm wrong and blah, blah. I actually started to believe her and so I simply gave up and even told her that, which was quite stupid of me considering the fact that I did turn out to be right. Ick, I knew it all along. Of course, I'm going to feel like a loser if I bring it up again, which I won't unless she mentions something about it first. Am I too over analytical? Maybe. It's just that she had the biggest attitude about it, as she always does with basically everything, and that grates on my nerves. If you're going to state what you believe, at least do it in a kind manner and not act as if you're superior to whoever you're talking to. Sheesh, I hate her sometimes. Her two sisters are just as irritating. It's as if they live for those "I'm right and you're wrong" arguments. I hate arguing with people... my point never gets across but then again, it's not as if they're ever willing to lend an ear.   School tomorrow. I so don't want to go... I wish I can just drop out. Well, actually, I don't because that was simply my stupid laziness speaking. Another five days consisting of stress and overwhelming feelings are in full view, although they won't be all that bad considering that the HSPAs (High School Proficiency Assessment) will be during morning classes from Tuesday to Thursday. It's basically a test that determines whether or not you'll be graduating high school. I hope it's not too difficult. I hate standardized tests with a passion. I mean, how can a stupid test represent your level of intelligence? Oh well, I don't believe it'll be too difficult. At least, I hope not.   I hope the rest of my junior year flies by because frankly, I've had enough of the same people and what comes along with knowing them. Besides that, I hate how I can never get myself to express how I actually feel about them. I have this tendency of being extremely cautious as not to let these people know what I actually think of them. It's not that I'm fake because with certain people that I strongly dislike, I make it a point to indirectly hint that to them. It's not ever too obvious, but they usually get the picture. I don't understand why they feel the need to put up an act as if everything's perfectly fine between me and them when it's not. Why can't they just leave me the heck alone? Blah. My school friends aren't all that great either. We've all kind of drifted away from each other, or maybe I've drifted away from them. I'm leaning towards the latter. Sigh. I won't go into it because there's too much for me to talk about and knowing how I am, it'll all come out as useless drivel.  My new goal is to update every single day. Whoah, that sounds a tad bit ambitious considering I never have the energy or motivation to do so. The fact that I blogged two days in a row is astounding, isn't it? ;) It's just that I have so much locked up inside and most of the time, I never get the oppurtunity to let it out in some decent form or outlet. I guess blogging's what some may consider therapeutic, and I actually believe it helps me greatly.  Well, I'm going to go read a little of  urlLink Born Confused  before hitting the sack. The book's actually humorous and interesting at the same time. I spent a long time at the bookstore trying to find a book for some light reading and that's one of the ones that I bought. So far, it hasn't been a disappointment.

      Oddly enough, some kind of motivation mustered within me and I suddenly wanted to blog again. Yeah, so I'm not deleting this blog as I had decided yesterday, although I did delete quite a few of my older entries, making sure to keep a select few that I liked. I suppose I should update about my life. Life's been going fairly well... I really think everything's back on track now, that things are going the way that they're supposed to be going. I'm actually satisfied with where I stand now. Believe it or not, that's a lot coming from me considering the fact that I'm always disappointed with myself since I tend to overanalyze everything there is. Going into every detail is obviously not a good thing to do. I'm seriously not as horrible as my mind makes me out to be, and lately, I seem to be realizing that with more understanding.   Hmm, what else? School's been good, I think. I'm doing pretty well in my classes and I'm happy with what my teachers recommended me for next year. I've been trying to figure out what I want to take next year. As for electives, I think I'm going to go for creative writing II (I'm currently in creative writing I), journalism, business and personal law, and Holocaust and Genocide studies. For academics, it's going to be advanced math, either physics or environmental science, English 12 honors, and possibly AP Spanish IV. Has anyone ever taken AP European history? I'm contemplating on whether or not I should take it because maybe that course may be too much for me... it's not that I wouldn't be able to handle it, it's just I just don't want to put myself in the position where I would regret it.  I heard it's really nice out... of course, I'm too lazy to get up and look for myself. We're going to be going to the mosque in New York tonight so I'm looking forward to that. They built a new masjid there so that should be cool, right? I had seen it when it was in the process of being constructed but now it's finally done, masha'Allah.   I haven't really talked to one of my good friends since Monday. A whole messy argument took place on Monday and well, harsh words were exchanged and feelings were hurt. Uhm, we did kind of talk on Wednesday... it's just that I finally blurted something out and we started talking but that lasted a couple of minutes. I think she's still somewhat angry at me about what happened, even though I hadn't initiated it in the least bit and everyone knows that. I guess you can say she's extremely stubborn and doesn't want to admit to herself that she was wrong. I'm quick to let go of things so I decided to start that conversation with her. Unfortunetely, we didn't talk again after that. Oh well.

      People are discouraging but sometimes that's good. You know, I gave up my "dream" of becoming a pharmacist after some indirect convincing from a few people such as my friends and guidance counselor, who I spent half of my lunch period talking to. I actually went to get my schedule for next year straightened out but somehow, a discussion about my future surfaced. I guess they're right about the fact that I shouldn't pursue something that would probably not even interest me in the future. I have no idea what I was thinking when I had decided a few years back that pharmacology is definitely what I want to major in. Ehh, I still have some time to decide everything over but the thing is, now that I've let go of pharmacy, I don't know what else I really want to do with my life. I mean, I have billions of interests but I'm not sure if they're what I'd make a career out of. For instance, I love history and English but I mean, I'm not sure if I'd major in those subject areas. Heck, more than half my schedule consists of intense history and English classes, completely outweighing my math and science classes. I actually would consider those areas but the thing is, my parents wouldn't appreciate it very much. Yeah, yeah... I know I shouldn't let my parents decide my whole future for me but I don't want to do something without their approval. Ugh, I don't know if I should be willing to sacrifice my happiness and fulfillment for theirs. Hmm, I can always think of other alternatives such as social working or even becoming a lawyer, but as I said before, I still have plenty of time to decide. I just need to come up with some ideas however vague they are.

      I'm avoiding the pile of neverending and time-consuming work that I have to get to eventually. Yes, later. It amazes that my hermit self hasn't stepped out of the house in such an annoyingly long period of time besides for school. I think it's been a whole week, wow. Oh well, in five mere days I'll have all the time in the world to do whatever I wish. I want to socialize by meeting up with friends, possibly catch a movie or two, spend time with family, watch hours of TV, which is something that has become quite impossible to do these days, and surf blogs. Oh, and it slipped my mind to mention that I'm going to California from the eighth of April to the twelfth. Woohoo, five whole days on the other side of the country! Should be quite an experience if I do say so myself. My family will be staying at my dad's khala's (mother's sister) house in Los Angeles.   Then the next two months will be full of rigorous SAT studying and all that jazz. Fun, fun, fun. I won't fail to mention that a large part of my weekend did consist of SAT studying! Sigh. I do have a long way to go. Insha'Allah though.

      Five more days until bliss, or should I say, spring break! I need this time off more than anything else in the world. Sigh. Earlier today, I actually registered online for the SATs on the fifth of June, something that I've been procrastinating to do for God knows how many days. I don't know, I guess the anxiety was holding me back from collecting myself together and actually taking that step, lol. Just please, please, please include me in your du'as! I would forever be indebted to you. Seriously. Pray for me, okay? College has been on my mind more often than not lately and sometimes I just get so freaked just thinking about it. What if things don't work out as I anticipate? What if I end up being unhappy with my major? How will I even decide what I want to do? I have no clue whatsoever. Well, I have a slight idea but I don't know if it's really my thing. Insha'Allah, Allah (swt) will make it easier for me.  Anyway, life's been going smoothly, alhamdulillah. On Monday morning, I went to guidance to record my schedule for senior year. The classes that I'm taking are as follows:  AP European History AP Spanish V English 12 Honors Advanced Math Business and Personal Law Women's Studies Honors Environmental Science Holocaust and Genocide Studies  I'm trying to decide between Holocaust and Genocide Studies and journalism because I'm not sure if taking three history classes would be too wise, lol. Insha'Allah, I hope next year goes well. I expect it to be the most academically challenging though. Blahness. Science should be cake though... haha, I'm taking an easy to handle science class on purpose so the load is lighter on me! Ahh, but the AP and honors courses will be a heck of a lot of work to handle.

      This week has gone by amazingly fast and I am ever so thankful for that. It's depressing the heck out of me that I have absolutely nothing to look forward to for this weekend after so many eventful weekends. Hmm, maybe something may come up but that's highly doubtful.   The past weekend was great though. I attended a presentation at the New York mosque about these  urlLink ruthless killings  and it basically consisted of a bunch of speakers who made speeches pertaining to world issues and such. I figure I should have made a speech or contributed at least something, but there's always next month. It's roughly a program at my mosque that takes place once a month in which a specific topic is chosen for different people to speak about. Sounds interesting, doesn't it? Saturday was actually the first day that it took place and I have a feeling we'll be keeping up with it, insha'Allah. I'm looking forward to speaking next time since I need to open up more. I think they're going to take copies of these speeches and put them in a newsletter kind of thing.   Then on Sunday, my family went back to New York to my cousin's house. What can be better than going to New York two days in a row? Nothing at all. I had a fun time bonding with my cousins. I wish I saw them more often than I do now.  I want to move back to New York more than anything considering New Jersey bores me. I think it has to do with the fact that New York is where my cousins are, whom I am extremely close to. They never fail to disappoint me. My friends here in New Jersey have, for lack of better words, drifted away from me. I mean, I still talk to them on a regular basis but our friendships are no longer intact. I've tried to mend ties more than once and frankly, I don't care anymore because there is no formula for friendship. It's either there or it's not, and in this case, it's not.   Don't you hate it when someone that you strongly don't want to talk to instant messages you out of nowhere? Argh, I'm sick of coming up with the usual lame excuses in order to avoid the person. It makes me feel somewhat fake, although I'm anything but fake. It's not that I dislike the person, it's just that I have absolutely nothing even remotely productive to talk about with her. She always makes the rudest comments about nearly anything that comes out of my mouth. She's definitely not the type of person that I'd choose to associate myself with.   I broke my I-will-update-every-single-day promise. Oh well, it's not like I was going to keep it anyway, lol. I usually have these short blogging frenzies that last a week or so and then slowly fade away, only to return a few weeks later. You all must have realized that by now unless you're oblivious. I've always been horrible at commenting, regardless of the fact that I read all entries. I guess I'm not who would be considered good with responding. That would explain the severe lack of comments that I've been recieving lately, haha. Anyway, soon it'll be a whole year since I became a part of this blogging world that we like to call Blogistan. Wow, a whole year! Time is slipping through my fingers like sand. Soon I'll be a ninety year old hag. Whoah, I just scared myself.

      How will everyone that I know react? Am I qualified enough to answer the questions that may come along with it? Someone had once said that we are Islam walking. Will I be able to handle that? Am I even ready? Hesitance and uncertainty raced through my mind whenever the subject of hijab was brought up, whether by other people or myself. I was aware of the fact that I was going to begin in the near future, or at least, that was what I repeatedly told myself. Every single day, I would brush away thoughts concerning hijab for another time, a time when I wouldn't be so doubtful. A time when I would have a better understanding of what Allah (swt) requires of me. This continued for years.  One evening in the summer of last year, after I had completed my Isha prayers, my mind somehow drifted into thoughts of hijab once again. However, this time, for some odd reason, my incoherent thoughts did not travel in endless circles that avoided the issue altogether. I was a fifteen year old who should have embraced hijab exactly six long years ago. Why had I not done this? Was it really as complicated as my mind made it out to appear? I reflected on this for a long time during that one sitting. I asked Allah (swt) to give me an encouraging push. Not a long while after that, a strange motivation mustered within me and I finally decided that I had shoved this crucial responsibility away for too long and I was not about to do it again. I was going to start.   I walked over to where my mother was and proudly told her about my decision and asked her for her views. I noticed how her face lit up and beamed as she started explaining to me that once I decide to do something unusually positive, I should start on it immediately without the slightest delay. That actually deterred the edginess that had previously began to settle in.  I am now sixteen years of age and it has been a little over a half a year since I started observing hijab. I have to admit that it is the most important choice that I have ever made in my life and things have definitely been for the better. I have the opportunity to clear misconceptions and misunderstandings whenever the need arises, which is an excellent way to give dawah. My friends never knew about the true meaning of the headscarf until now and they completely respect me for it. A few of them are even beginning to show an interest in Islam.   To me, it is not simply a "piece of cloth" as many like to conveniently call it, but rather, it gives me a sense of identity and guards my modesty so that I am not a slave to society and the endless vanity that surrounds us. While most girls my age are conforming to what society expects of them, regardless of whether or not it’s healthy for them, I can be free of that through my self-worth and closeness to Allah (swt). At least now I can determine easily who my true friends are, and those are the ones that accept me regardless of whether or not I cover.   My only regret now is the fact that I did not start to cover sooner. Nevertheless, hijab has become a part of me, a part of me that I can never imagine myself without. Allah (swt) has answered my prayer.

       urlLink One .  urlLink Two .  urlLink Three . Not one, not two, but three attacks in a span of three days. The death toll in the two cities in Iraq has risen to 271 and estimates of the wounded range from 300 to more than 400. Are a person's beliefs a reason for them to die? When will this stop? What disappoints me more is when people actually praise these disgusting acts of hate and violence.

      Believe it or not, I've been in the school choir since freshmen year. Yeah, three years in a row. However, I'm certainly not signing up for it next year, and I strongly don't want to be in it at the moment, but I have no choice since it's a full-year elective. Not only have I completely lost interest in it, but I actually gave up listening to music back in November or so. I never really talked about it until now because it's more of a personal thing, I guess. I reached to a conclusion about music based on what I read and researched because there was no way that I was going to quit without looking into it beforehand. What I did come to discover brought me to quit listening to it altogether, and for the past four months or so, I haven't put on a song on my own accord. Initially, I hadn't thought that I'd stick to the promise that I had made to myself, but surprisingly enough, everything came out different from what I had predicted. I'm usually not good about these kind of things.  But anyway, my choir teacher's in love with me for some odd reason that I've never came to understand, and probably never even will. I have a feeling that me leaving choir will be a big disappointment to her, and I feel extremely guilty thinking about that. Not only that, but a bunch of my good friends are a part of it and I guess you can say taking choir for the past three years shaped me into the person that I am. I'm not sure if that makes sense but it does to me. I guess I have to put these little reasons aside and look at the bigger and far more important picture.  Today was the second day of the HSPAs, and I believe I did fine. At least, the exam was considerably easier for me than I had previously thought, so yay for that. For the first part of the test, we had to write our interpretations of a picture, and everyone that I know wrote the most morbid stories ever. I guess the picture itself could be percieved as morose and morbid or whatever. On the contrary, my story was as optimistic as ever since I turned the whole meaning of the picture around, lol. I was surprised with myself. Anyway, I'm going to have to make up yesterday's math portion of the exam since I was absent. Sigh.  I must get started on my homework! Oh, I got my algebra test back... an eighty eight. I didn't even make any mistakes! It's just that instead of putting my answers with commas in between them, I wrote them separately or something like that. It's hard to describe, but I really don't think she should have taken off so many points just for that, considering I had the correct answers. Eh, whatever.

      Wowserz, this is my third consecutive day of updating. My day was terrific (when do I ever use that word?) although I was slightly disappointed with what I recieved on my chemistry test, an eighty nine percent. I really thought I had done better considering the fact that I had put such an incredible amount of time and effort into it... I skipped a night of not going to the mosque and afterwards, even regretted missing the lecture. Oh well, I guess the grade's not too bad, and my average did increase by a lot. Now I'm awaiting my algebra quiz grade. Sigh. I hate school. Honestly, I'm really not a perfectionist. Well, some that I know well may argue to that but I know for a fact that I'm not. Of course, I like things being a certain way that I want them to be but I'm not obsessive about it or anything. I just expect more from myself.  Remember that friend who I mentioned in my last entry or the entry before that? I seem to have forgotten. But anyway, her and I began to talk normally with one another. That includes laughing together and whatnot, so I guess it's all good. Hehe. I was starting to get worried... I hate the silent treatment.  I have this friend who's contradictory in every way possible when it comes to religion so sometimes it's rather difficult when I talk to her. It's not that I mind, because I really enjoy talking to her about it and attempting to clear her misconceptions. More often than not, we talk about religion, but especially lately, it seems as if I'm talking to a wall. She's actually a practicing Christian, but she questions a lot about her faith and religion in general. She believes in Jesus but thinks that a lot of stuff that goes along with the Bible is fabricated, which of course, it is. She also believes in evolution. I explained to her that that's really just contradictory to the concept of creationism and Adam and Eve. She agrees with that, but still leans towards evolution. A little while ago, I sent her a website that highlights the reasons as to why the evolution theory cannot ever be actually proven and yata, yata, yata. I think it would be pretty helpful. Well, anyway, she started talking about how every religion in the world says that people of other religions will go to Hell. I started going on about Islam and how it's different because that's definitely not what Islam states about the people of the book. Although she believes in heaven and hell, she also has the idea that reincarnation is very much possible. Actually, not even heaven and hell, only heaven, and that everyone who's deserving will have their own personal hells. She also brought up a lot of other points and I think that if I work on it, I can maybe get her interested in Islam and have her see the reasoning in it. Of course, I'm not going to try to impose my beliefs on her because that's something that I absolutely detest and don't understand.  It's already March. Where the heck did February go?!? It seems as if it had just started yesterday. I think I'm getting old. Oh no. Anyway, I shall be back later, or whenever I feel like it, which may be never. Haha, just kidding! I think I'm addicted to my blog again! Isn't that wierd? Okay, I'm off the wall kind of hyper right now and it's starting to scare the friends who I'm talking to online at the moment. It's rather amusing if I do say so myself. Anyway, I better be going.

      Oh man, oh man... I had this whole amazingly wonderful entry typed out and boom, an error message popped out of nowhere and there went my spontaneous thoughts which will be back who knows when. Maybe later. Maybe never. Sigh. Life sucks. Today sucks. Some people are horrible and should be kicked off the face of the earth. They don't deserve to breathe my air. I'm serious. Gr. I just want to kick someone right now. I mean, something did happen but I'd rather not talk about it. Hmm, just maybe I will talk about it later in my entry. Just maybe.   Anyway, there is something that's been crawling under my skin and hasn't been making any indication of leaving. It's been driving me crazy. I know it's horrible to constantly worry about how others percieve you and all that shiz, but sometimes that's hard for me not to do. I know, I know, it's not a great quality to possess, if you want to call it that. It's as if I have no control over it and I can just never suppress that anxiety. I hate having to censor myself when conversing with people because it's just plain annoying. I mean, I should have the decency to truly express how I feel inside, right? I've always wanted to be the type of person who willingly contributes innermost thoughts and emotions, awing people with bluntness and persistance on voicing what's inside and never for a second hesitating to talk. Why can I not change myself to become just that? Why is it so extremely difficult for me to just let the words flow out and do their thing? Yeah, I'm aware of the fact that I'm ridiculously pathetic and will probably never amount to anything if I keep treading this path of censorship and the need to please others.   However, I'm not too bad in that respect any longer. This quality of mine that I possess, or used to possess, has been dying down lately. It's amazing how much a person can change in such a short period of time. The person that I was only a few years back is hardly the person that I am now. I'll probably be saying the same exact thing five years from now, laughing at my current self and my life.   And so I was rejected from the PAL (Peers As Listeners) program at my school. It's this thing where seniors mentor freshmen on issues having to do with school, drugs, and alcohol. Yeah, it sounds a bit cheesy but that's what it is and it looks really good on college transcripts. Besides, I wouldn't have minded being able to meet new people and just basically talking to them and socializing. Anyway, and so I was rejected after my application was reviewed by the PAL committee. You know what's wierd? The PAL committee consists of a bunch of teachers and each application that is submitted is reviewed by only one teacher of the committee. Thing is, nearly all of the teachers that are part of that committee are teachers that I've had in my years at this school. Yeah, that can be a good thing or a bad thing and in my case, it's a terrible thing. I'm usually quiet in a class in which there is no one I really know... in the classes that I've been taught in by these teachers, that was the case. Now, these teachers are under the wrong impression that I'm a meek person who's incapable of talking it out with other people and being outspoken. That's unbelievably false and not at all how I'm like in reality. Once I start talking, I just can't get myself to stop... giving advice is really my specialty, not a weakness. Most of the teachers are just biased, never willing to consider the fact that I'm not necessarily the same person inside the classroom as I am outside of it. Sigh. Stupid teachers. I hate them. I really do. I think my application was near perfect, not lacking a single thing, lol. I really wish the selection system was designed in a way so that the teachers wouldn't know who's application they're reviewing, and just base their selection on the application itself rather than the person that they supposedly claim to know. Maybe use ID numbers instead of names? Anyway, no point in discussing this now since nothing can be done.   Anywho, we returned from California yesterday at around eight at night. The flight was at eight thirty in the morning and so we had to wake up at four. Argh, wasn't pleasant at all. Seeing my great-grandfather, however, was something that I'll never be able to forget. He's such a great person, just wow. Tears wouldn't stop coming out of my eyes the night before we left and the morning after that. It's just so sad how little we see him due to the fact that he lives on the other side of the country. I really do hope his health improves and his cancer doesn't spread. Just please include him in your du'as whenever you can and I'd be so grateful. Pray that his surgery that's supposed to take place in July goes fine. Just please do this. At least for me? I could go into so much more detail about California and all that occured but at the moment, my motivation is lacking and my brain's capability to think seems to be deteriorating by the second.

      My dad came home from work at around one in the afternoon to take my brother and I to our dentist for a checkup. While I was waiting for my mother after my appointment, I started a conversation with a young girl reading a Popular Science magazine and occupying the chair across from mine. Although at first glance most people would assume her to be extremely young, she said she was in the third grade. So we were talking and it turned out that she was reading the magazine for a school project, heh. Her mom and brother came out of a room and they seated themselves next to her. Her mom wouldn't stop glancing over at me. However, it wasn't anything that would make me feel uncomfortable because it was casual and rather harmless. Suddenly she asked me where I'm from and so I told her. Turned out she was a Syrian Muslim, hehe. I could have never imagined that they were Muslims. Masha'Allah, it's nice to come across Muslims like that considering the fact not many are to be found around where I live. She curiously inquired, "do people ever taunt you or say anything negative about your scarf?" I responded, "suprisingly enough, people that I've came across have been incredibly respectful to me." You know, it's funny when people ask me that question because I always have the same answer and others expect something completely different from what I respond with.   Hmm, tomorrow's my last free day before we leave. A part of me just wants to spend the rest of spring break here, not having to commit to anything. Sure, I want to see and experience something new but now's not the time for me. I haven't been feeling too great today and neither am I in the best of moods. I guess part of it has to do with the fact that my throat's been aching like crazy. I don't know what I could have done to cause it but I hope the soreness goes away soon. This is probably going to be my last update for a while, unless I decide to update tomorrow or from California.   I finished the PTV drama,  urlLink Lab-e-Dariya , a little while ago. Yeah, I guess you can call PTV dramas a guilty pleasure of mine. It's what got me in a depressed mood because the ending was a great shock to me, lol. It ruined the whole atmosphere of the drama but my mom argues that it was a realistic ending. I'm a sucker for happy endings. Nevertheless, it was a good drama. My mom claims that I look exactly like the girl who plays Shafi Muhammad's daughter, Naheed Shabbir.   I put up a tagboard after a long, long time of not having one so go on and drop a comment or two to let me know you've been here. It's looking mighty empty at the moment. I also added a bunch of new links to the left so yeah, go check them out when you have a chance.

      Sometimes I worry too much for my own good and other times, I just don't worry enough. Sigh. It's like a neverending cycle. Nevertheless, I'm not going to stress over what my last entry's rambles were talking about. I'm simply going to live life day by day instead of mapping out each and every element of it. If I have a mind set on pursuing that direction, what's the fun in anything? Funny thing is that now I'm not nearly as confused and perplexed as I was two days ago. I've grasped a more clear understanding of what I want from my life. Insha'Allah, I hope to keep gaining focus of the bigger picture so I can eventually come to discover what's right for me and what's not.   The past week had been one of much discomfort and tumultuously overwhelming feelings of stress. Alhamdulillah, at least I survived the last week of the third marking period that I thought was never going to terminate. As one of my recent entries had stated, this spring break will consist of all that I haven't had a chance to do in what seems ages. Sleeping sounds unusually attractive compared to everything else that is on my list of things to do. I just hope I manage to snag some "me" time before we depart for California. Time to myself is what I need more than anything.  Hmm, this is rather off topic but I tend to do that a lot so I don't really care. So much can be misinterpreted online and that's one of the things that I don't particularly like about the net. It's strange because you can not mean something and the person on the other end will understand it as something entirely different from your original intentions. Eh, everything good comes with consequences. People should at least attempt to word their thoughts in a very specific way, making sure to oversee the overall tone of their words, so as not to send across the wrong or unintended message.  My family will be going to the mosque in New York tonight after weeks. I don't know, it was all so sudden and unexpected that I was surprised. Hmm, going there is always an interesting experience. Besides, I get the oppurtunity to reunite with my wonderful cousins who always manage to make me smile. They're just incredibly cool. I know I mention them a lot in my entries or at least, I believe I do. I probably do once in a while. Anyway, so I'm anticipating going there again. Woohoo :)

      I'm free, for at least two months! Okay, I finally have time to breathe. Junior year officially ended yesterday. I have to say that out of all my years in high school, this was the most memorable and defining. I learned so much about myself that I couldn't have even imagined before. Both good things and not-so-good things.  I've been confused about my future for so long but I think I actually have an idea about what I'd like to do with my life. Actually, after much research and thought, I'm pretty much sure about it. I'm going to major in Biology, minor in English, and complete the required prerequisite courses as a pre-med. My undergraduate years are going to be tough but they're going to be incomparable to medical school, aren't they? Haha. Oh, and I think I'm definitely going to be attending college in New Jersey because I can't bear to stay away from home for too long! I'm such a baby. However, medical school will probably be in some other state (or hey, maybe even abroad!) far away. It may also be in New Jersey but I have to keep all options open, and considering how tough it is to get into medical schools, I need to consider all possibilities.  Anyway, enough about school! I just needed to put that all here so I actually remember. It feels nice to not actually be committed to anything at the moment. I mean, sure, I have tons of summer homework, volunteering, and college researching to get done this summer, but it's not anything that needs to be done right here and right now.

      Funny how just by my mom's vivid accounts of certain relatives of mine that reside in Pakistan, I have these clear images of them imprinted in my mind. How accurate they are, I don't know, but I'd like to find out someday. How long has it been since I've been to the motherland? Sad, but I was about a year old the last time I went, and that was for my mamoo's (mother's brother) wedding. People that I know visit often, maybe every year or every other year, and here I am, someone that has no idea about how it's like besides from the stories that others have relayed to me. So I'd really like to go sometime, preferably next summer since it'll be the ideal time for me to go, the summer before college. Due to my parents' overprotectiveness, however, my hopes may be futile since the idea of my going alone would be completely illogical.  I always wonder why my parents hesitate so much about going. What's the big deal? They don't ever provide me with substantial reasons for not going, so I'm always left with the notion that they don't want to have anything to do with Pakistan. I know that sounds extremely harsh, but that's how it comes off. I don't know what I base my reasoning on, but this idea's been in my head for many years and I have a hard time dispelling it.  I simply miss everyone there, regardless of however little I know them. Their stories have become a part of me, and I'd like to elaborate on that part of me. That can only happen when I actually meet these people in flesh and see for myself.

      I nearly had a heart attack this morning when my computer wouldn't start. After three weeks of being computer deprived, my dad finally managed to take some time out and see what's up with the computer. He installed a new hard drive and everything, but for some reason, the computer still wouldn't work normally. So for the past few days, I've been working using the safe mode with networking option. This morning when it wouldn't start, I seriously had a panic attack, lol. What if safe mode's stopped working, too? What if I never get to use my computer again?!? Oh my god! It really is scary&nbsp;how dependent I've become on my computer for the past few years, and the weeks that I didn't have any computer access were hard. Much to my relief, I tried restarting it a few hours later and suprisingly enough, it was working just fine! Shukr'Allah.   Well, I finally figured out that yes, I can get a gmail account of my own through my blogger account! Man, I should have realized this earlier, but nonetheless, I know have a gmail account that I can't stop gloating about, hah. If you want to  urlLink email  me or something, don't hesitate! Besides, I've been feeling pretty lonely this summer because I'm not getting to see my friends as often. While I didn't have computer access, my friends went behind my back and made plans (like having late night movie fests) and whatnot and didn't bother contacting me about them. Or they told someone unreliable to let me know about stuff, but the person either forgot or never bothered.   Sad, huh? The youth group meetings that I talked about a few entries down are going smoothly, alhamdulillah. Unfortunetely, it's pretty male-dominated as of yet because most of the group consists of guys. However, we're trying to get more girls involved but apparently a youth group that meets two hours once a week isn't worth their precious time. Girls suck.   Anywho, tonight is my first Princeton Review SAT class and boy, am I not excited. I feel as if my summer days are going to go to waste because I'll be having to actually think. Not good at all. Oh well, I chose to take the class and now I must.

      I've learned a lesson and that is to not get in the way of other people. Even if you were only trying to extend a friendly hand, you only end up getting hurt and feeling sorry for yourself. I don't understand how people can be so ruthlessly harsh, completely undermining the fact that their words and actions&nbsp;can break others.   There are times when I start feeling so miserable but then I think to myself, "so what if no one's on my side? Allah (swt) is on my side and always will be, so why am I torturing myself instead of holding my head up?" And to know that Allah (swt) is listening to me and understanding me better than I understand myself is too great a comfort. Slowly the pain begins to subside and I don't feel as pitiful. Breathing becomes easier.

      So I might get a job at Barnes & Noble. Woohoo, that means cash of my own! Honestly, I don't spend much to begin with. I'm not a huge fan of shopping so whenever I do have the need to go, it's my mom who drags me along her whether I want to go or not. My point is that I don't really need this job, but I'm going to go for it because I desperately need to fill up my time. It's the summer and the days are tediously long, so why not occupy my time with something that's somewhat productive, right?  There was a dawat at my house the Friday before the one that just passed and a lot of family from New York came over. My mom had planned it for my aunt that just came here from England for a visit after many years. My other aunt convinced my brother and I to spend a week at her house in New York, so of course I couldn't refuse since I have nothing else to do anyway. We returned from there yesterday. We did a lot with our cousins, including bowling, eating out, movies, and more. Overall, I had an awesome time and I wished I stayed longer than I did, which was about a week and a half.   While I was there, my cousin came up with the brilliant idea of starting a youth group. He called up prospective guys and I called up girls and as of yet, there are about twenty people willing to become a part of it. The first meeting will be on Sunday at the masjid near their house. Hmm, that does mean that every single Sunday, my brother and I will come all the way to New York to attend these weekly meetings. Sounds exciting, huh? Thing is, my cousin will see how it goes during the summer and then decide whether or not he should keep it going after the summer. Pray that we recieve a good response, insha'Allah.  On the other hand, life's been kind of confusing lately. Well, I'm perplexed about something specific and I don't know whether I should do something about it or just lay back and let the situation unfold itself. The former option can be risky considering my relationships with certain people can become awkward or even deteriorate. However, if I keep my heart optimistic, I can anticipate even something good happening as a result of taking action. Sigh. The latter option is just as risky, because if I never do a thing, then good things can be confounded out of my hands simply due to the reason that I didn't have the guts to initiate. I always turn to Allah (swt) for help and I just hope that everything falls into place as it should, and if things are not meant to be, and if I have to get hurt in order to prevent something worse happening in the future, then let me get hurt. It has happened before so what difference does one more time make?

      I'll be going to Lake George with my family this weekend, as I had mentioned in my angry entry a few below, lol. It's this place in New York by the shore with lots of recreational stuff to do, such as amusement parks, cruises, hiking, shopping, horseback riding, etc. I suppose it's a fun place, but I'm not really in the mood to go. I guess because there's so much that needs to be done at home that I can't even see myself being able to enjoy it while I'm there. I'll have that constant nagging feeling inside of me, annoying me to the point where I can't enjoy myself. There's loads of summer homework left for me to do, and not to mention college stuff. Although a month still remains until school opens, I still feel as if time is running out and I need to finish everything right here and right now. It's wierd. I'll have to live with that feeling. Is it just me or do only New Jersey schools assign ridiculously time consuming summer assignments and readings?  Anyway, classes are going fine, alhamdulillah. The three and a half hours don't seem tediously long, so thank God for that or else I would have died from the boredom. The instructor keeps things interesting and takes a creative approach towards teaching material. It's cool, but I'd still rather be at home, doing whatever it is I do on weekday nights.  Okay, I've been typing up this entry for the past like hour, so I'm going to go now. Lousy entry, yes, but whatever. I just wanted to say I'd back on Tuesday. Oh, and I installed a new commenting system (HaloScan) so all old comments have unfortunetely, been discarded. Sad, sad, but I'll live.

      There's been some leaving-the-net-for-good business these days. It makes me sad. Although I've never met these people in my life, I still feel like I know them personally. I guess I shouldn't get attached to people like I do, but really, can you control something like that? I highly doubt so. Well, I guess we just need to move on and put things in the past.  On a message board, someone had made a thread asking about how we came to Islam and it really had me thinking about my own life and what my circumstances were. I'll write what I wrote there, but add a little bit more. It was last year that I became genuinely interested in Islam, and it happened sort of accidently, really. I mean, I was born Muslim but often times I took Islam for granted and didn't take the time to understand it. It didn't have any significant meaning in my life, and to me was almost equivalent to my cultural identity. I was always a good girl, but kind of fluky when it came to came to Islam and didn't care to improve myself as a Muslim.  They say the net's good for nothing, but for me personally, it's played a big role in Islam becoming a part of my life. I stumbled across some website about Islam and soon I began visiting it every single day in hopes of reading the new articles that were posted. At first I didn't admit to myself what was happening, but I realized that religion started to make sense to me and became of relevance. Soon enough I became extremely interested in religion. I found a few Islamic forums and just by reading what people said, became inspired and whatnot. I began praying, reading the Qu'ran, observing hijab, etc. My parents were surprised as heck, but of course, I still have a long, long way to go. The journey never ends, right?

      I was more than upset when I wrote my last entry. When I read it again, I began to think about the reasons that justified my feeling that way, and I came up with plenty. No use in listing them, because it'll only make me more angry. But in any case, I have gotten over it and life is going on, alhamdulillah. I guess I tend to overreact sometimes, and that's why I've been attempting to practice the art of self-restraint for the past week or so. Judging from my last entry, you can guess how it's been going, huh? Then again, I have this blog as a sort of therapy for myself, and where else would I go to let out how I feel? As long as I don't have a fit in front of anyone, I think it's okay to vent.  I have a long way to go, and the journey will be difficult and strenuous, but I know in the end it's only myself and the others around me that I'll benefit. I have anger issues that need to be resolved. I have more of a silent kind of anger, not the kind of anger where I hurdle things across the room or (astagfirullah) cut myself out of frustration and pain. However, although it is internal anger, it can be just as painful as physical affliction upon myself. Things get to me that I shouldn't let get to me, no matter how hurtful they are. Why I act this way is something I haven't ever recieved the answer to, but I know I have to stop myself. Man, is this goal hard, but nevertheless, attainable. I know I can certainly change myself because I've done it before and I can do it again if I give it my all.

      You know, I've become so fed up with my life that it's gotten to the point where I have a hard time getting out of bed in the morning because there's absolutely nothing at all for me to look forward to. I can't help feeling this way, and today just added on to the big heap of things that screw up my life. I was looking forward to today's youth group meeting all week long, counting down since last Sunday, and it turns out that my dad's not going to take me because he has other, apparently more important, things to do. He has other priorities. Oh, and I can't go next week either because my dad planned for us to go to Lake George, as if we haven't went there enough. It's a total bore of a place, and I really don't want to go there. Anyway, he knows that these weekly youth group meetings mean a lot to me, considering I never, ever get the chance to talk to Muslim people around my age, or any age for that matter. Only once a while, and even that is rare. I have no Muslim friends. When these youth group meetings started up, I was excited that for once my parents had no objections to taking my brother and I to New York just to spend time with our Muslim brothers and sisters. I really felt as if I belonged there, and that no other setting could substitute it. My imaan had taken a leap and I could just feel the difference inside of myself, and it felt good. Better than anything else I've felt. Even that has now been taken away. He suggested I go to the mall instead, as if he didn't know that I hate the mall. My dad always does this. He lets us participate in something and then makes us withdraw from it, and the fact that this little something was what strengthened my imaan holds no value to him. He really couldn't care less.
