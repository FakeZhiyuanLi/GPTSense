      well, it started on friday. Hill and Dani and I decided to go to motion nightlife down town. i always have such a freaking fabulous time there. well we went to eat at Ocharleys, and then we met up with miranda.&nbsp; We started drinking in the car. Dani and I had smirnoffs and 2 bottles of wine from eastgate to MOTION.&nbsp; WELL, WE GET THERE, START DANCING AND I LOOK UP AND WHO DO I SEE, JASON, THE ITALIAN STALLION.&nbsp; HE DOESNT SEE ME AND I DONT KNOW WHETHER OR NOT I WANT TO TALK TO HIM. WELL I DRANK A FEW MORE BEERS AND GREW SOME BALLS AND DECIDED TO WORK MY WAY OVER TO HIM.&nbsp; WELL, HE DID RECOGNIZE ME, SO WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT WORK AND CRAP AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE MISSED ME AND STUFF, SINCE I HAVENT SEEN HIM IN AT LEAST 6 MONTHS.&nbsp; WELL THEN I WAS GOING TO GO BACK THE GIRLS, BUT HE ASKED ME TO DANCE WITH HIM SO I DID. WE STARTED DANCING AND IT WAS SOOO WEIRD, LIKE JUST LIKE ALLL THE TIMES BEFORE WE STOPPED TALKING. HE EVEN SMELLED EXACTLY THE SAME, CK1.. ANYWAY, WE STARTED DANCING THEN KISSING OF COURSE AND IT WAS LIKE ALL THE MONTHS HADN'T EVEN HAPPENED.&nbsp; THEN OUT OF NO WHERE HE SAYS "ITS FUNNY TO RUN IN TO YOU BECAUSE I HAD DREAMS WHEN I WAS IN CHICAGO OF MAKING LOVE TO YOU.." SICK, I KNOW.. I MEAN, IT JUST CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD. HE IS A NICE GUY, PRETTY HOT TOO. IT WAS LIKE A BLAST FROM THE PAST.

      Well, we are home, finally from a longgg weekend of crazy camping. I had a very nice time actually. It was weird having the entire family there. I was soo happy to get to know Danielle. Its so hard for me to figure her out, well it was at first, but now i feel like we are actually good friends. I want to hang out with her sometime, like for real. Make her feel happy, you know? I don't know whether or not she has a very good home life, my gut says, NO..   I went to sarahs tonight after Haileis volleyball game. It was fun at sarahs. i feel bad, like i have been a horrible friend to her through the whole "baby" stuff... I wish i could give her more of my time and of me... i just feel like i dont have anything to really offer her. She also seems to have a lot of friends (Jons friends girlfriends) who i couldnt really compare with. Like they are all around, 247 and i am not. I feel like an aquaintance instead of BEST Friend.. I am going to try harder.. I SWEAR!  Time to go watch Bowling for Columbine.. :-(

      Well... It is the big weekend of the summer, Fourth of July...The family is all going to Rocky Fork, again, to camp for the weekend.  It should be interesting, at least a bit entertaining, I suppose. It's bizarre because everyone from both sides of my family are going to be there.  It's always a crazy thing for me to see the members of my family coming together the way they do. I am so happy to have such fantastic people in my family, but its weird too to have so many people gathered from both sides of your family and for them to actually get along. You know, you see things on TV all the time about how people hate their family, or families don't get along on like "the other sides of the family." and then for my family to act like the Brady bunch, it's just a bit crazy and hard to handle.    Ok, Here's my problem with the perfect family... I AM A WRITER. When was the last time you saw an artist with a perfect childhood, idyllic parents, a family life to die for, and a strong relationship with everyone in my WHOLE family, LET ALONE the fact that I have only had to deal with (thank god) one really significant death in my family.  Its just hard, you know? Like, I never feel like I have anything important to say.  Like my trials and tribulations are adolescent and unexciting. Who would want to read all this mushy bull crap that I have to write about?  NO ONE... Well, at least that's what I think.  But, there has to be someeee one who would want to publish my stories. Maybe, if I got off my ass and actually started writing again maybe someone woulddd like to read my stuff.. What else am I doing? I mean, I teach 2 hours a week, and then sit on my ass the rest of the week doing nothing.     UGHHH! Today, Hillari and I went shopping. You know, I HATE SHOPPING. I really really despise it. Like it would be fine, I suppose, if I could find anything that I actually liked.  I have the hardest time shopping, but today I was on a roll..I bought a miami sweatshirt, 3 beer tee shirts, a gray hoodie, a black crocheted hooded poncho thing, and a comfy pair of pants.. finally I have somehting I can wear to a campground....  I am sleepy.. time for bed..
