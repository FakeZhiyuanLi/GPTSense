      First day of a short assignment today and it happens to be at a place I hate most; right in the heart of the CBD. The morning rush was horrendous with the crowd shooing and pushing one another; suddenly felt like a lost infant amongst them. Work was easy but boring. After all, it's purely data entry. The tons of paperwork I faced are enough to put me off typing for some time. The only consolation I get is the window seat and viewing the beauty of the city skyline from the 30th floor.   Made a serious folly this afternoon during lunch. Was having BK for lunch and I don't know what got into me. Was supposed to order 'chicken junior whopper' but ordered 'junior whopper' instead. It made a hell lot of difference; it was to my horror that it was beef instead of chicken I had ordered. But well, time was running out and there was no time to re-order. Gritted my teeth and sank them into that brown and aromatic patty. It was the first taste of beef after so many donkey years. Pretty proud of myself though for I managed to finished half of it. But the aftermath was pretty traumatising (somehow this statement reminds me of an orgasm gone wrong)...the lingering taste of beef in my mouth nauseated me for some hours after the meal. No more moo moo for me.  Things are starting to look brighter as part time assignments are coming in. Scheduled for a formal interview later in the afternoon; geez...hope all goes well. The real world is such a scary place. Dogs eat dogs, cats eat cats; who knows what else eat each other. I should start practising cannibalism.  I realize kisses do wonders to a person. Putting aside the sexual implications, kisses are actually pretty therapeutic; especially when they involve the tongue. Do I sound like a guru? My actions speak louder than words.    "Kissing without involving the tongue is likened a toilet without a toilet bowl"

      It's a heavy downpour out there. Come to think of it, it hasn't been raining for days. I love rainy nights; falling raindrops are music to the ear as I slowly slump into dreamland.   My heart sank as Susilo drowned in his opponent's strong and precise strokes. He found absolutely no returns to the latter's powerful and well plotted out moves. Wonder where his supremacy which carried him through went to. Guess he has to find comfort in girlfriend Li Jiawei winning her match. He must be grimacing not only from his defeat but also the money which he could have been rewarded.    "They say youth is a blunder; manhood a struggle; old age a regret. I have no qualms about these cause I'm in womanhood."

      I didn't know blogging can be so interesting and such a hassle at the same time. The html is driving me nuts...certainly killed a number of brain cells for an IT idiot like me. The few links I uploaded, though looking simple and unappealing, took me hours to figure out...was trying to decide how to do it, where to put it and how it shld appear...it's really time to empower myself with such skills.  Had always wanted to create my own blog but never got down to it; partly because of the reluctance to put in the effort. However, YZ kinda inspired me to start on it since I'm just as free as he is. I believe he and I would be entertaining ourselves to each others' blogs should I tell him about this.  Caught Ronald Susilo won his 2nd round match on tv. He's certainly got what it takes to win the competition. Though he's not Singaporean by birth, I'll still hope for him to win. Can't wait for Majulah Singapura to be played in Athens.  Job hunting has been bleak as usual. Down but not out; keeping the positive spirit and attitude alive. I would not have sustained that long had it not been someone special. Thank You for being there.  "In three words I can sum up all I've learnt about you: I Love You"
