      There is nothing worse than being about to tuck into a very appealing Thai green curry and being stopped in your tracks by the question "You look different - have you put on weight?" My weight and I have a non-engagement relationship.  I dont bother it, and it doesn't bother me.  I dont think about it until people bring it up.  Like my Mum telling me I have child bearing hips last year.  And the year before that when I got back from Thailand her best friend saying "You're looking well! Have you put on weight?" I've had weight issues in the past.  I've been overweight.  I had an eating disorder at 15.  It's an incredibly fucking touchy subject with me, however most people know how to keep their mouths shut, and I know how to not think about it.  I only think about it when forced to, and when I'm forced to, WHAM, here I go again spiralling down until I think I look like Roseanne at her worst.  I  know  it doesn't matter.  But my brain seems to do it automatically and force me into this place where I feel so disgusting I can hardly breathe.  I haven't been there for a while.  Not since last year in fact.  I've been happy being being happy.  And now I can feel that horrible sinking feeling in my chest, and I can  feel  all the fat on my body and suddenly I feel like I'm thousand times bigger than I am.  It's awful and so so hard to control.  Usually I do a pretty good job of it, and really have lately but right now I feel like I can't breathe.  When my Mums friend said that to me it took me a very long time to get past, and by the time I had, my Mum was telling me I had child bearing hips. Why does it matter to these people?!  Why does how I look matter?  I know you're thinking I should be asking myself that question but I know all the anwers but the emotional problem is there.  Call it body dysmorphia or whatever you like, but I control it to the best of my ability and it isn't an issue until others make it one.  I dont like being in this headspace.  It makes me feel horrible and out of control and really edgy.  I feel like screaming at everyone and locking myself in my room.  I feel like being  nasty  to people and that's not me.  All this from just one little question.  I've already decided to go and sign up the gym tomorrow merely just to make myself feel better about it.  It doesn't matter if I'm fat or not, the problem is that my body image gets severely distorted when people say things like this, and I have to do  something  to return to a semi-healthy state.  I hate being like this and I refuse to be like this and end up with a fucking tube in my nose.

      Today I have written 2400 words, and made Rainbow Brite pyjama pants.  I should feel like I've accomplished something, however I now feel caged in by homework and bored bored bored.  I can't wait until I am through this shit.  This has been possibly the worst semester I have encountered since the semester when I failed graphic design because Dad came back to Australia and I hadn't seen him for two years and he looked like skeletor because he was so sick and thin.  I got the shock of my life and promptly failed EVERYTHING.  This one obviously wasn't that bad, but it gets second prize.  Never in my life have I felt so unchallenged and uninspired.

      I've hit a wall.  My brain can't form arguments now.  It's a really interesting phenomenon that after 3 or 4 hours of writing I have to stop for the day.  At least that will help me with next weeks 3000 worder.  This is a lot easier only having two subjects though.  Four is hard!

      Just reading style.com 's summer report and COLOUR IS RETURNING!  No longer will I have to walk around seeing all these I'm-so-cool-I-look-like-a-corpse girls in their beaten washed out clothes and deconstructed flaking skin coloured crap.  You know what colours are coming in?  BLUE, RED, and GREEN.  You can't have a too cool for school attitude in those colours.  Fashion affects our whole world, you can't escape it once you step outside and while I will never own a pair of Ugg boots unless it's to warm my feet in the privacy of my own home, I am to a degree at the mercy of what's in the shops.  The last two years I think I have bought two pieces of clothing, and that was because their predecessors had holes in them.  I have hated current fashion, I partly blame September 11 because before that it was getting quite exciting, and then following it, it all became quite ruined looking and washed out.  I'm such a visual person that this was sheer torture :P   The only thing I would probably buy from this new trend would be coloured Lacoste polos because a few of those with jeans or skirts means summer is covered.  However I can't pay $72 US for a fucking polo with a croc on it so I'll just have to make my own!

      Excerpt from my essay, "What Makes The Web Work?  An analysis of the World Wide Webs' immense success".  "...Berners Lee found a simpler way to realise a human intellect augmentation system than Nelson..."  I feel like changing that to 'Human Intellect Augmentation & Thinking Universal System' and seeing if I get away with it ;D  Sums it up brilliantly.

      Yup I'm a thousand down and that just about covers my introduction.  I've set up the key principles, now it's time to knock em down!  Not that I'm going to.  Soon I'm going to go and grove it up with the other grovers with the drinking and laughing.    In other news I have solved the problem that is My Hair.  In primary school it was never an issue.  My Mum brushed my hair and put it in ponytails.  When I got to high school and it was left entirely up to me, it descended into the realm of pubic halo fuzz.  It was probably hormones too, but kids would come up to me and asked me if I ever brushed my hair.  They would tell me to tie it back.  And because they told me to - I didn't.  Quite the black sullen and contrary little madam that I was.  But I would look at the popular girls and take the passive aggressive line that they were just like that.  They were the way they were, and I was the way I was.  No one ever told me I could change, and I wasn't exactly the most forward and introspective thinker as a teenager.  I was too busy trying to escape reality to possibly think about how escape  myself .  I can't pinpoint when I did start caring, I think your hair says so much about you - literally too now it would seem if you read that study about your hair being your history.  Until now it has been a series of failures trying to make it do what I want.  I stress until now.  The hairdresser did two things.  The first was to remove a fuck of a lot of my hair.  I have really thick hair.  You could make shipping ropes out of it.  He spent an hour getting it to an acceptably thin level.  Now it looks like it sprouts from my head rather than hang flat like it doesn't want to be there.  The second was that he shampooed it twice.  This is the important bit.  Because after he did that - I tried it.  I've tried to copy hairdressers in the past, but always forgot that step.  It's (for me) the magic step!  The first shampoo is like yeah clean whatever, the second is ultra squeaky clean.  Which means it probably lets in more conditioner or something.  Yeah yeah whatever, at any rate my hair is now sprouty and shiny which is all I ever wanted.  Funnily enough, my stepmother told me when I was about 8 that my hair should be squeaky clean.  I took absolutely no notice of her because her hair looked like dogshit she dyed it so much.  No shit, it looked absolutely revolting - like straw and there was no way I wanted hair like that.    Yes as you can see, I'm just as informative and entertaining as usual :P  I just wrote a whole post about hair.  Because I'm such an interesting person.

      I really want an overlocker.  And a Husqvarna Lily.  I could probably buy an overlocker but lets be realistic, I am now out of a job (I dont particularly mind being out of THIS job).  So with my last pay, I need to buy a suit to look for more jobs.  I've bought a mobile phone so potential employers can call me reliably, and once I have a suit I'll be set.  I haven't heard back from the Monash International job and I applied on Monday so I'll assume I haven't got it and keep looking.  I would have taken it so personally a few years ago!  Now I'm all meh, onto the next one.  I am not exempt from the difficulty that is job hunting.  But gee I want an overlocker.  I could go so much faster.  Furthermore, the universe is conspiring against me.  Every time I look for jobs, the first ones that come up are 'fashion designer', 'pattern maker' etc etc.  Are the powers that be trying to sell me something?  I am no fashionista.  If I were to design clothes they would be sensible, warm, and well fitting.  The reason I dont go into it is because it is littered with people like Sophie and Sasha.  Vacuous chemically treated soul sellers who live their lives from aspirational purchase to purchase, who think that if they hang around successful people, they will be seen as sucessful too!  I couldn't stand it.  I can't enter that industry because of the stigma!

      Today I had to get up to level 7 of the engineering building with two laptops, my bag, and a data projector.  I have no strength.  The weight of those isn't so bad but when you start adding peripherals like the powerpacks, powerboards and extraneous cords, it all becomes a bit too much for my 5'2 frame.  Anyway at any given time in engineering, half the escalators work.  It's a power saving thing.  So they would carry me up, or I would walk.  I could hardly take a step upward!  Was pretty funny.  People behind me were getting shitty because they couldn't get up the escalator because on the moving ones I wouldn't move (they're exactly wide enough for one person).  And on the non moving ones it took me AGES to get up them because I thought I was going to topple backward!  I tried to distribute the weight evenly, one laptop strap went over one shoulder, other laptop strap over the other, data projector strap over first shoulder, bag with everyones assignments in over the second.   I collapsed into the classroom and dumped it all the desk and found a group waiting. Now this is where I began to get shitty.  If they had done this themselves in the first place, the group could have broken up the task of carrying all this shit and no one would have sore shoulders! It wasnt so bad but I fell asleep and started getting this blinding headache and when I woke up it was in full swing and my neck and shoulders are all bruised and feel like someone has been pounding on them with a jackhammer.  Don't even get me started on being woken up again by the usual suspects.  Trying to have any sort of routine in this house is impossible.  My Mum is erratic at the best of times and a shift worker, so she just does whatever, whenever.  My brother spent the first half of the semester going to bed early and now stays up all night playing computer games and then getting up really early.  I dont know how he does it!  I can't eat my dinner at a set time because the conditions in the kitchen are different every time, and I can't watch TV because someone always complains or makes noise if I do.  I have never craved routine in my life until this year.  I think you really need it when you work because your time becomes that much more precious. I may add that the other lesson I will learn this year is being a bit tougher with people.  I should have insisted my students get that gear, but I have a huge problem with asking people to do something I dont know how to do myself and I didn't know how to hire a laptop and projector until I went and did it myself.  I should have gone and asked in the first place so I could say to my students 'this is how you do it' and then they wouldn't have been so apprehensive in the first place.  It's the bloody horse shoe nail all over again!   For want of a nail the shoe was lost. For want of a shoe the horse was lost. For want of a horse the rider was lost. For want of a rider the battle was lost. For want of a battle the kingdom was lost. And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.    (Apparently it's an old rhyme but I first read it in What Katy Did by Susan Coolidge).

      Literally.  serps laptop was pretty heavy but then I went and got a library laptop and data projector too for my students to present with and had to haul them all across the school.  I lost the first round of student marks too when I rebooted the library laptop and it deleted everything on its desktop.  Nice one.  I found a temp file on the hard drive though that seemed to contain some of what I needed and the rest I can remember.  Fucken technology. I'm an angry little EZ mouse aren't I!  Had the best sleep after that post.  Pity there was only 6 or so hours of it but today the all engulfing tiredness has wiped out all emotion.  I'm still shaking from getting through the morning though.  To have to very quickly learn how to use the data projector and wireless setup so my completely incompetent students could do their presentations, to losing that first round of marks, and having to carry that shit everywhere.  Oh and the not much food part. I'm not whinging.  Dont mistake it for that.  This has taught me a huge lesson in organisation.  I am incredibly disorganised.  Ridiculously so.  I cannot manage my time at all.  So no prizes for guessing what lesson this year is all about :P

      1.  Falling asleep when I didn't want to. 2.  Being woken up by my brother playing with the dog right outside my door, on floorboards. 3.  Getting the wrong jeans from Ebay. 4.  Trying to eat dinner with my family and my brother smacking his lips and eating and talking with his mouth full of food, on purpose, because thats how Thais eat. 5.  Feeling angry. 6.  Tomorrows impending presentations. 7.  Fucking students plagiarising. 8.  Spending two hours marking one essay because its plagiarised. 9.  I have PMS. 10.  Everyone eating all the muffins I make and there being no sugar in the house and no one making any more because 'that's what Katy does'.  "You're just good at that sort of thing" is one of the most insulting things said to me by my family when requesting I do something for them and I ask why they can't do it (i.e. hemming).  Did I just magically gain the knowledge I have?  Does my patience come from some magical spring that some people possess and some do not?  No, both have taken agony and hard work.  I got the knowledge that I have by making mistakes and failing repeatedly and being big enough to not get discouraged.  I got the patience I have by being hit by an ex army arsehole as a child and nastiness and silence from schoolgirls, a dead and incompetent father, and a bowel obstruction complete with twice daily heparin injections on the same arm and vomiting dark green bile every 15 minutes exactly for 48 hours until they decided to operate(no shit you could set your clock to it).  I know that everyone is different.  Some people aren't patient and that's fine.  But to those members of my family and their significant others who dare suggest that I am somehow magically this way you can get fucked.  I can't believe Simone left her pants in my room with a note asking me to fix them.  After she unexplainably cracked the shits when I got a sewing machine in the first place and told me I wouldn't follow through with it.  And I fixed them.  I fixed them because I knew she would annoy me about it and I'd rather fix them so they wouldn't break again. I hated how Brendan told me I was 'lucky' to get the marks I did.  I hated how Steph cracked it at me for not 'including' her like I am some magic social person when I was trying so hard to make friends at uni and beginning to succeed and I hate myself for letting that make me feel bad and then withdrawing and not really getting to know anyone so I wouldn't cause her and Brendan to give me crap about not fucking including them.  I hated how they cracked it over me not saying 'hello' to them enough.  And Sasha too.  Why do these people think that I am this way for no reason????  I CRIED my way through that programming subject and thought I was going to fucking fail but I didn't give up and got a HD through sheer effort and Brendan got just as high a mark as me by stealing peoples code!  Okay now I'm beginning to feel like Rimmer in the Red Dwarf Omnibus right before that emotion sucking monster is about to take away all his anger and he cycles through all the unfair stuff in his life.  And to keep with that theme, I'll end with his immortal words...  why, Why WHY?!

      As per my GoalPro software, I have spent the morning marking.  It is now currently lunchtime where I get to eat and read blogs.  I should have had this structure off my parents I think, but to their credit I think they managed given the situation.  Well my Mum did, Dad was great when I actually got to see him.  At any rate, I've nearly finished the marking for one subject.  It didn't take me as long as my head had built it up to be, it just needed to be worked on consistently.  And on my little calendar I had a lunch break, which was something to work toward.  I have four left.  I should do them but I've had it with them for today.  After lunch I must mark 1 full New Media essay.  This is harder because they're second years and I don't feel nearly as qualified.  It's okay though because I got MTIL to send me some he's corrected so I know what to look for.  Sounds like the mailman is here.  I wonder if I'll get my new jeans today?

      I finally finished this book last night.  It's taken me all semester to read it.  A whole semester of consistently losing it under my bed, forgetting about it, reading a bit then falling asleep, and staring wistfully at it when doing work.  Yes, you can very obviously tell that it was a gripping book :P It wasn't that bad, but the writer was far too literary to be writing a book about Arnie.  He inserted this whole comparison of Arnie with Nietzsche that went for half a chapter.  Back to the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying for Me.  I am determined to get through it.  I seriously can't wait until I have either finished work and uni, or have a full time job so I can just sit down and read.  I'm too tense to read atm.  I just can't bring myself to do it.  Same with computer games.  My head fills up with all the other stuff I should be doing.  I  can  go off and sew because that creates the illusion of productivity, but something purely for enjoyments sake?  Can't do it.  And I can't wait until I can either.

      I just got an email from MTIL (see the title;) asking when we would be done marking the essays.  I am a week behind on everything.  I have not gotten essays back before an exam before.  I dont know what to do.  I have this week to write 5000 words, watch and mark 15 presentations, mark 14 corporate reports, and mark 22 essays.  Is that even physically possible?  I suppose it would be if I was incredibly efficient and organised.  I feel strangely calm.  Titanic captain going down with the ship calm.

      Turns out the sewing magazines I bought at the market on Saturday are in German!  Oops.  I was too busy looking at the diagrams to notice what language it was in.  I wish my brain and I weren't always in such a hurry, then they wouldn't trip over and forget to check what language things are in, and they'd choose their words and say all the right things at the right moment and be generally witty and interesting.  Okay yes I have nothing to talk about.  It's funny how once you remove your audience save for the friendly few, there's nothing you can really say that they don't know about already!    And oh yes, I'm already missing making pointed blogs!  I suppose it's only a matter of time before other people find this blog - fuck I'm already paranoid about it enough to not have a bitch.  I do that enough in real life anyway and it's nothing you guys haven't heard before ;D  But it's a lot more private here and going from having people I hardly know at uni bring up things from my blog, to no one but the people I like knowing anything about me is frightening, refreshing, and will probably cause me to really change what I post.  Maybe.  I don't know.  I've eaten 8 gaiety chocolate wafers and half a bag of chips and I want to hurl.  Why do I do this??  It's like some food demon takes me over and causes my hand to reach for more and me, the driver, has no control over the steering wheel and watches helplessly as I stuff my face. I blame Steve Bracks!

      I can't help myself.  You all know this.  I just wanted to say that I really like my new blog.  It feels like a cubbyhouse.  Only the people you know and like can come in and hide and look out the window with you.  You know what?  I really miss cubbyhouses!  I miss building tunnels with the couch cushions.  We used to make a cubby out of the couch, and use the extra cushions to make a tunnel leading to it.  It was so exciting!

      I already don't like the blogspot banner.  If I get the time at some point I'll move this back to the old domain and hide it somewhere on there so only you special people can see it.  What has spurred all this is my reading of the Tibetan Book of Living and Dyings chapter on impermanence.  It's all about understanding that everything changes all the time, and that if you try to hold on to things, or sameness too tightly you will suffer greater trauma when things do change.  Learning to let go of things so that they will hang around does your head in, but actually works.  In fact the only thing that doesn't change is impermanence!    Which brings me to a second point, speed reading.  When I was younger I read so much that my Mum took me to a counselor who told her things were fine, it was just my way of sorting things out.  As a result I've always been able to absorb things really quickly, but never really remember ANYTHING.  I can suck it in, spit it out, and as soon as I don't need it anymore it's gone.  But this book I'm reading I do slowly.  Some nights I dont even finish a whole chapter.  I could read it fast but it would defeat the whole purpose.  I want to  know  this stuff.  So every night I take in a little bit and it's with me for the whole next day.  The whole next week if I dont keep reading!  It gives me time to think about what I've learned and what I'm going to do with this information.  It's a nice way of learning I think, every night I think that I am having a lesson before I go to bed.  Only this lesson isn't about anything formal, its about how to live your life so you can be patient, open, and happy.

      I got called on my mobile today around 5pm about a job applied for last week.  That I couldn't remember.  The lady asked me why I wanted it!  After some fumbling around I finally set myself right and she asked me to come in for an interview.  The job is as a media support coordinator, which involves 'html campaigns', direct marking (yay), and a host of other bitsy things.  The pay rate is very good (although I did tell her that as a graduate I was focused more on job satisfaction than rate) and naturally I am shitting myself.  My mind is racing, so many what ifs, I have a million browser windows open where I'm researching the company, the trade practices guidelines (she mentioned them), and a bunch of other stuff.  I have no idea if I'll remember all this tomorrow.  I keep thinking it will be terrible if I dont get it but I keep reminding myself that this is just the  first one .  Naturally my brain is screaming WHAT IF THERE ARE NO OTHERS but thats just silly.    Here is a breakdown for my benefit:  If I get it:  I will have what sounds like an interesting job. I can move out. I can save up for Spain and an overlocker.  If I don't get it:  I can go and stay in Bendigo with  urlLink serp  for a week. I can keep applying for other jobs. I will have lots of free time to lounge around and sew and lie in bed with  urlLink serp .  Ahhhh I feel a little better now.

      Every death feels a little bit like you're living in a snowglobe.  The snow is nice and settled and then something comes along and shakes it all up.  The more it is shaken the longer the snow takes to settle.  And the pieces never fall in the same place again.  I learn something new and change a little bit more every time someone dies.  Yesterday, standing in the church looking over the sea of family I found some peace.  Later on the way back from the movies with  urlLink serp , I realised why I remain, as  urlLink Shrike  once put it, relentlessly cheerful.  Cheerful dispositions get mistaken for many things, and with good reason.  Once in frustration, I asked  urlLink serp  why what has become my nature is so often met with smug cynicism and patronisation.  He pointed out that we are constantly bombarded with happy empty media, joy over washing detergent, hyperreal smiles over chocolate bars.  And children are always happy because they have not yet had those experiences that make them cautious and unhappy.  I am neither of those things.  We talked about people who were permanently unhappy with everything and who let the slightest things upset them.  We put it down to a lack of life experience, or more notably a lack of trauma!  It sounds strange.  Before my Dad died I was part of the cynical throng, the overtly serious sort of person who saw all the bad in the world, who let a look or a word ruin her day.  Even for a while after he died I remained that way - no one changes overnight and I was angry for a long time.  I wouldn't wish the knowledge I had been given from that event on anyone.  It changes your world.  It changes you until you don't know who you are in your own skin, and you have to figure it out all over again with this new information.  All those sad, angry things in your past can turn you into one of two things.  You can be a victim or a student.  I was given the choice of remaining cynical and angry, safe in my knowledge that I knew 'The Truth' or I could take the much harder path of treating every single new event individually and learning from it.    It's so easy to be cynical and angry!  It's so safe there, they become such familiar emotions - and then you get a taste of happiness which is so fleeting than when it goes away you feel as though it will never come back.  I have so many experiences in my life.  The bad ones seem to stand out sometimes.  The good ones are far more subtle, and far more likely to be taken for granted.  But I had the choice.  So I remain cheerful, not as any sort of payback to the bad, but because I know what happens in my every day life is  nothing  compared to those past bad experiences.  I have a benchmark if you will.  It's not from a lack of knowledge of experience that I'm happy most of the time.  It's from a great  depth  of knowledge and experience that tells me that it's my life now to do with as I wish.  I survived those bad experiences and now I'm graced with the knowledge that everything will be okay, even when things feel like they're not.    Nothing ever upsets me too deeply because things have been so much worse in my life that all those little annoyances, I am happy to say, make me laugh.  I am happy to have those small annoyances!  If that's as bad as my life is then I am so, so lucky.  I'm happy that I get to wake up and be alive and eat breakfast and be warm.  I'm happy that I am unrestrained and no one is mistreating me.  These past few years are the best I've ever had it and I'm so grateful.  I have so many reasons to be cheerful.  None come from stupidity or childishness, although I see now how it can be taken that way.  I have learned in my life what some don't learn in their lifetime.  I had to go to hell and back to learn it, and I still will never wish it on anyone.  But once again I've been shaken up and the snow is settling now into a new pattern; I feel like another door has been opened for me and my gratitude increases onwards.

       urlLink Shard , let me get this straight.  You deeply hurt a girl with your shining insensitivity and lack of tact, and because she is cold to you afterwards, you threaten her? Which part of this is a 'game' exactly?  This isn't a game.  You hurt her and then you threaten her because it's gonna take her a while to get past?  And  then  view it as a battle of the minds?  Take some responsibility for yourself and take what you did and the consequences on the chin.  Maybe if you had of been big about it she would have noticed and liked you for it, possibly with forgiveness and hugs.  Now all she sees is emotionless (and girls are all about emotion) and cruel.  Classy, real classy.  My ex boyfriend was like that come to think of it.  If he did something wrong and hurt someone, the guilt he felt quickly became anger that  he  could be in the wrong and then became as nasty as possible so he could push the other person into being nasty and thereby evening out the wrongdoing.

      Yup I have heartburn.  I ate too much toffee before bed last night and in the middle of the night I kept having to roll onto my stomach to muffle the pain.  Go me.  My brother got back from Canada today and rang me up.  Simone told him when he got home - he didn't get the email.  Nice one hosebeast, way to start criticising  before  there is a problem!  She better not say anything to me about it.  I have a host of responses that I probably wont use :P  I put in my dole form today, was first at the counter so the 45 minutes I put in the parking meter was a complete waste of my ten cent coin stash.  Then I saw the ONE DAY ONLY OMG SPOTLIGHT SALE ad on TV and went to Spotlight with my Mum where I didn't buy much because it was ALL CRAP.  I got a marking pen, some fabric paint and a stencil because I want to try hand painting fabric.  Jeez their fabric is shit.  I saw some brown embroidered taffeta that I really really really wanted but couldn't afford :(  It was only $10 per metre but I dont get money until tomorrow!  I didn't mind too much, I spoiled myself terribly at the sale on Friday.  I'm already digging out patterns to make this stuff into.  Anyway the funeral is tomorrow at 3pm in Berwick.  In her infinite wisdom my Mum will only go with my newly returned brother so we have to go to his house first while we wait for the hosebeast to return from work and she 'may be late'.  In Brunswick.  I pointed out that is somewhat in the opposite direction and that I was happy to drive but Mum told me to drop it.  She wants us all to go together and for Damien (oldest son) to drive.  It's going to be hard tomorrow.  I rarely see my Dads family - they all look exactly like my Dad except they're not and remind me of being a kid again.  And when my grandma (their mother) died a couple of years back, at the gathering afterwards, one of my cousins who I hadnt seen since I was like 6 came up to my sister and I and snapped "It used to be me that never came around - now it's you guys" and walked off.  I was gobsmacked.  Weddings, funerals and Christmases sure drag up some weird actions out of people.  I'd only met her once too!  The rest of them are fine though, they understand.  It's just as hard for them to see us.    I am quite uninteresting at the moment otherwise!  I have no desire to do much, probably the weather.  I was pretty happy and bouncy on Sunday until I found out that Don died and since then I've been flat and tired.  I'll be sad tomorrow at the funeral.  I understand the importance of funerals now.  They are a very necessary closure and carthasis.  You need to concentrate that grief and let it out or you'll be flat and tired forever.  You also need to meet and even bring up the angry thoughts in your head to people who have no idea they've done nothing wrong.  Even if it's only so you can go and feel bad for ragging on people you hardly know :P  Looks like it's the week of epic blogs if you're still reading!  Maybe I'll go lie down for awhile.

      Watching Masters of Style on the ABC and rapidly discovering exactly why it is I like Gaultiers work so much.  The doco is explaining how he constantly ditched boundaries and used outsiders and travelling as inspiration.  He threw everything into the mix regardless of gender or cultural distinction, mirroring the world at that time (mid 70s-90s).  As a 15 year old he didn't want to be a fashion designer, he wanted to be a couturier better than Cardin!  One thing I have noticed with highly successful people is their megalomania, they truly believe they are better than the best and become a self fulfilling prophecy.  The title was one of his more provocative collections.  I don't think I will ever do this professionally but it is a goal to get my own clothes to couturier standard.  I don't want to say my clothes belong to any particular label, but I do want them to fit perfectly and be made to an incredibly high standard.  He ended up getting picked up by Pierre Cardin and was apprenticed in the old couture house of Jean Patou (the lipstick I broke ;) and he did ready to wear for ages and broke rules and changed fashion blah blah.  Then he launched his couture house and I'm watching the work...jeez.  The level of technical skill required is unbelievable, I can't even put into words what I'm seeing, let alone figure out how it's been done.  Interestingly enough there are only 13 true couture houses and to be classed as one they have to meet the strict requirements of the  Chambre Syndicale de la couture parisienne  and it really pisses me off when you get American brands like 'Juicy Couture' charging ridiculous prices for velour trackpants.  Haute couture is made individually to fit each person, and most of the work is done by hand.  Of course, you end up paying $20,000 for a skirt!  I'm one of these people who  need  a craft.  For a while I thought it was writing but the interest waned.    The CEO of Gaultiers company is saying that anyone can make clothes.  He says an outfit must have a story behind it and that without one it just fabric.  I need my self expression.  I can't fit it into words.  Maybe I can't fit it into clothes, I don't know yet but I do know that everything I have made to date has a story.  And they're my favourite clothes!  They're not clothes, they're stories!  And who doesn't love a good story?

      My brothers bitch wife told my Mum that I shouldn't have emailed him in Canada and told him about my uncle because he was coming home tomorrow.  She was annoyed and Mum pointed out to her that he probably would have wanted to know right away.  I did wrest with emailing him for 5 minutes, until I decided that yes he probably would want to know right away and that being told at the airport after 16 hours of travelling would probably suck a little bit more than finding out at a stopover in LA.  At least he'll know what he's returning to!  Also I have no idea if he even knows, he would have been boarding the plane when I sent it so I dont know what she's so pissed off about.  Probably being his wife and all, she wanted to tell him.  But if I were married I wouldn't mind if my spouses sister told him a family member died.  I'm not going to play her stupid game of having to go through her to get to my  own brother .  Grow up Simone, this isn't about you.

      My uncle Don died last night with his wife and daughter at his side.  Two weeks ago he became jaundiced and started bleeding from the stomach.  He was my Dads brother, the other so called 'smart' one in the family who 'should have gone to university' like my Dad.  He worked at General Motors for the better part of his life until they retrenched him a few back for no good reason other than there was someone younger to replace him and he never really recovered.  My poor other uncles, they've lost two brothers and their Mum in 6 years. My uncle Bryan rang me up to tell me, he's such a nice bloke and used to play footy for Hawthorn in the eighties, mullet and all.  I used to collect football cards with him on it.  I used to sit on uncle Dons knee.  My heart feels tired and sad.  I know how this works now, no more throwing crockery at the wall and screaming at nothing like I did with my Dad, just quiet acceptance.  Am I supposed to continue raging against the dying of that light?  It gets pretty same old after a while.  There's only so much raging you can do.  There's only so many books you can read and people you can talk to while looking for your answers.  I stopped reading like a maniac after Dad died.  After I found out today, serp and I went to the Vic Market and got some borek and bratwurst and went to the nearby park.  We looked at the trees, the sunlight through the trees, and the colour of the grass in the light.  I wanted a camera but knew I couldn't capture on film what I was seeing.  My senses were alight and only I can capture that.  I'm sorry for the incoherency, my mind doesn't know where it is right now.  It's sailing somewhere, where the waters of past and future meet and once again revisiting everything armed with this new knowledge.

      Last night I put the TV in my room so when I woke up I just turned it on and serp and I lie there and watched a doco on how the planets tides work.  First of all that is bliss, I havent watched TV in bed at home in forever.  Then we got up and serp very kindly let me drag him to the Gwendolynne sale, an Australian designer who makes beautiful clothes, who happened to also be selling their fabric!  I wish I had the money for the clothes, the lowest priced items were satin and lace camisoles which were $80.  But the fabric...ahhhh the fabric!  I got 2 metres of blue stretch satin, 3 metres of stunning red and gold chiffon, and 2 metres of black and silver SILK FREAKIN BROCADE for $50!  I will get at least four, well made items of clothing out of that for $50.  Maybe not the calibre of Gwendolynne but still tons better than what I can afford.  After that serp and I went to the Pancake Parlour for lunch and gave ourselves stomach aches, and then, we went to CAE and signed up for beginner spanish classes!  I can't wait, it's going to be so much fun learning a language of my own volition ;D On the way back I went into this other designer shop called Body.  I like Body, they have interesting ideas for clothes but for fucks sake.  They had this bustier in the $20 basket, black satin, with a chiffon tie around the top.  It had been marked down from $260!  I could make that in my sleep.  Are people really so fooled by soft focus photography and idyllic landscapes that they would pay that much for a fucking top?  It's not like the fabric was anything special.  I guess that's why Gwendolynne could sell their fabric so cheap.  Just say you pay $400 for a bolt of really nice fabric (and that's probably overshooting, I have no idea how much they cost) and you get maybe 60 tops off it at $300 - it pays for itself in an instant.  After that it just gets cumbersome.  Hmm I may go back.  Yes, yes I think I shall!

      Here is my plan.  I received another two rejections today (along with my rego bill *sob* goodbye overlocker)and decided to take this as a sign that I am simply not ready.  The rejections were of half hearted attempts driven more by unrealistic hopefulness that I'd made a resemblance of an effort.  It's not enough.  So to make sure I get through each day without ending up a wreck, I have to get something done so I'm in the habit of bettering myself (dont I sound like a self help book!) No job hunting today.  I'm not ready.  Today is exam marking and room cleaning. No job hunting tomorrow, I have to meet with job network and have a markers meeting. On Friday maybe, but I will also work on, with a hope to finishing these websites. I have to fix up all this shit first because it really has created a mental block thats stopping me from thinking coherently.

      If I were to choose a course of study now and could get into anything, it would be either Fashion at RMIT, or Telecommunications Engineering at Monash.  There is really not that much stopping me from doing either (for the former a folio but I can do that), but I need a rest because we all know I am the queen of mind changing.  But yeah, right now I would do those.  Both are infinitely interesting to me for different reasons.  Okay so the only thing I wouldn't like about the latter is the Java programming.  Oates sir you are crazy and love it but it has made everyone else I know near suicidal, and if ASP makes me near suicidal Java will make my head explode.  Yes okay maybe my rejection letter got to me a little more than I initially thought and I do have PMS after all.  Don't you hate it when you feel like you could be so much  more ?  But you're not sure what more is?  ARGH MOTHERFUCKER.  This girl on the Vogue forums did physio at Melbourne Uni, then quit halfway through to do the double degree serp wants to do at Swinburne and now she's an Oracle DBA which is a wonderfully inspiring story for me that falls flat with the occupation she landed in.  I dont want to get to 80 and define my life through database design.  Then again I dont want to define it with philanthropy either - I'm too selfish.    Also I have to move out so I am away from my families opinions.  My brother told me I would never get into the TV industry last year and for so long he was my mentor and encouraged me and now whenever he sees me he puts me down.  He says I would be better suited to 'publishing'.  Goddammit I can so much more than that and I bet it's because he's scared I'll outstrip him.  I need a job so I can get out of here and get some time to think and then really go far.  I dont have a lot of time because this needs to be done before 30 so my biological clock doesn't mess me up and make want to nest FFS.

      Call me shallow but I can't tell you how much I get a kick out of the whingers on the Vogue forums.  Their complains make me feel so so smug.  Here is a list:  "I go to the solarium three times a week and now I have wrinkles and can't get rid of them!"  "My pointy toed shoes have given me bunions and Mum says the only way to remove them is through surgery!"  "I'm a size 6 and have NO boobs - are there any creams that will make them bigger?"  Why is idiocy so satisfying?

      Feeling better now, half a large can of apricots, some milo on toast and the news that Morgan Freeman is trying to turn RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA INTO A FUCKING MOVIE!  Lets recap:  Enders Game Willie Wonka I, Robot Rendezvous With Rama (possibly) Alien vs Predator Aeon Flux Hitchhikers Guide Alone In The Dark (I shit you not, it's based on the very awesome game). Chicken Little (SERIOUS!) The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe Die Hard 4  Pretty good!  There's probably more but aside from the ones I already knew about, I only got up to F in the production lists at IMDB.  Time for bed now I think!

      So I reapplied for those jobs, only one had provided an email address with which I could explain myself but never mind, at least I made some attempt to rectify my overenthusiasm.  Anyway that left me in a right shit, and then I had the misfortune of opening the inthemix site and having a read there...fark I wish I knew how to block that site on my firewall.  I got flushed and hot and angry and wanted to break things.  PMS is annoying like that, I'm not actually angry at anything but I feel angry at everything, fucking hormones getting in my way.  So then I decided I didn't want to feel angry so I went and finished my shirt (lovely albeit impossible to iron), and made some vanilla, honey, and orange body scrub (although I put too much soap base in).  You'd think with all that accomplishment, a Centrelink visit, 8 jobs applied for, a shirt finished and some body scrub made, that I would be happy.  NO I FEEL LIKE A GRUMPY AND HUNGRY BITCHFACE HOSEBEAST.  There's no food either.  I cbf going anywhere because it's too cold.  I do get $90 this week final pay.  Maybe I'll buy Red Dwarf III.  Grump grump grump huffalump etc.

      Okay, NOW I am pissed off but it is at myself.  I can't think straight when I have PMS - that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it.  So I applied for eight jobs.  By job number four I had forgotten to change the position title in the cover letter.  So now four jobs are going to see me applying to be a 'multimedia editor' when I was applying for different things.  I feel angry and idiotic.  Not to mention those recruiters are now going to think I'm retarded.  At least they were only PR jobs.  I didn't really want them, I was just on a roll :P

      I should be in a bad mood.  I had my 9am appointment at Centrelink this morning, and I arrived early and armed with all the necessary documentation, only to discover their computer system was down (techs had been 'enhancing' it over the weekend), and they told me they would call me when it came back up.  Also my Goodies DVD arrived at 7.45am although fortunately I was already awake because I was driving  urlLink serp  to his exam.  Maybe its PMS but I'm feeling quite chipper.   I'm very tired though, can never seem to get to bed early when I have to get up early, it's like I have to make the most of my night or something.  I have tons I could write about but I'm too tired and hungry and wanting to see what will happen with my day.

      Got up at 4.30am to drive my bro to the airport and was quite surprised to find he was not awake.  He was quite surprised too when I woke him up, he'd set his alarm wrong.  I drank tea while he rushed around and just when we were going out the door he said "I think my bag's too heavy", so I got out the scales and sure enough it was 30 kilos!  He had quite a few textbooks in there.  We tried to lighten it up but didn't have time so we just put it in the car and discussed various methods of lightening it - finally struck upon the solution of pulling out a larger, empty backpack in there, putting his smaller carryon into that, along with the heavy stuff from his suitcase like schoolbooks and toiletries.  I hope he sorts it out - I told him not to be lazy and just empty stuff into a storage locker, leaving it for other brothers wife to pick up tomorrow when she takes Damien to the airport.  I also warned him not to 'take risks' in China.  He laughed.  He knows exactly what I mean and I bet he will anyway but I had to warn him - he can be so stupid sometimes just for the thrill of a challenge. Anyway the freeways are a fucking rush at 5am!  I love driving so so so much.  Now I have to stay awake for my centrelink 'information session' (whatever that is).  I just had my hotcakes and a hash brown, 2 hours till I have to be there.  Last night at the family dinner I decided I wouldn't let my brothers wife get to me, so I set about ignoring her and talking about stuff she had no idea about, like asian politics with Raph and digital tv with Damien.  No one else was talking to her and she just kind of sat there looking lonely and then I felt really awful.  I hate seeing people feel lonely even if I don't like them, especially if it can be avoided.  There's no good reason for someone to be unhappy if they dont need to be - especially in the family dinner situation.  So then I told her I liked her coat (it was really nice) and started chatting to her about makeup and showed her  urlLink Strawberrynet  and she was much happier.  I dont know if I lack integrity or what but I know how shit it feels to be left out and if I can't stand it, why should anyone else?  But she wasn't a bitch or anything to me on that occasion and I felt so terrible deliberately ignoring after I saw how she was just sitting there.  I just tried thinking about all the people I don't like, and if they were in that situation would I talk to them so they wouldn't feel alone?  I'm afraid the answer was yes - to most of them.  The only exception was ex cokehead friends and Steph, the latter because it would just be rescuing her and she needs to learn (if she hasn't already) to get up and talk herself. I wish I wasn't such a pussy about people.  I wish I could be a hardarse and just not care and I try hard not to but I can't help it.  I can't help it when I see people unhappy - I dont want them to be because they don't have to be.

      Tonight we had a family dinner for Raph who goes to China for 10 weeks tomorrow.  My sister, brother + wife, Nanna,  urlLink serp  and my aunt came over and we had a good time.  Damien helped Suzy with her psych exam and I took photos of everyone with my grandads camera (and my Dads old flash which I had kept for no good reason until tonight when it was sorely needed!). My grandma was on her best behaviour for once, I think she's lonely and just likes being around us now...I said as much to Mum and she just laughed and said "give her a couple weeks", cynical but she has good reason. Anyway Damien goes to Canada on Saturday to meet his openBSD friends, and I discovered the reason Simone is not going.  Damien is going there for a 'hackathon'.  I said wtf is a hackathon, and he got really excited and went "we're going to code software for a whole week!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" My response? ....................... Anyway then I thought it would be something cool you know, like, hacking software or something, but no, it's just crap for OpenBSD.  Yawn.  Then Simone started up on how come he couldn't do that from home, they could to Japan together yada yada and he was all I've known these people for five years and never met ANY of them.  It's good for him, to not go overseas for business.  I hope he has a great time. Anyways off to bed, driving Raph to the airport and have to get up at 4.30am!  It's okay, he drove me and  urlLink   to the Burmese border and got up at 4am so we could spend the day at Mae Sai. Anyways I'm feeling good about things, like my life is about to get very exciting.

      40 minutes of DDR, email sent, room is clean.  Hell has been avoided for now.  Doing out what I set to do has made me feel quite cheerful and no it's not a lot but it is sure better than nothing.

      MTIL strikes again, this time with a carrot.  I told you all about how he was saying they were getting x thousands of dollars of funding for this research and he needed a research assistant, quickly followed up by the disclaimer that he wasn't trying to 'seduce' (sic) me into staying.  I politely declined and for the 3294873298 time explained that I had been at Swinburne for 5 years and needed a break.  Anyway today I emailed him:  Hiya MTIL (no I didn't use that ;),  Centrelink need me to get you to sign this form saying there's no work for me at Swinburne before they will give me money (and more importantly, access to their jobs database!) and I was wondering if you were around tomorrow so I could drop in and get your signature?  Also let me know when roundabout you want to have a markers meeting for these exams too, I'll be finished them soon.  Katy  To which he replied,  But there is work for you....  I'll be around between 10:30 and 12:00 tomorrow, so just drop by the office.  WHAT THE FUCK.  I am so pissed off.  This is what he does.  Dangles carrot then disclaimer.  He is monstrously selfish, all he can think is that he wants a young female companion there so he can feel young himself (ph33r my armchair psych).  God this pisses me off.  Is professionality TOO MUCH TO ASK?

      May I just add that the body of knowledge required to understand this novel is HUGE.  The author was obviously Oxford educated (at least his main character is and shows it), I lost count of how many works are mentioned or in some way referred in this book, French and Latin are used interchangeable with some Greek and German thrown in for good measure.  There is a Latin quote at the end which I  did  bother too look up, (Cras amet qui nunquam amavit. Quique amavit, cras amet. May he love tomorrow who has   never loved. May he who has loved, love tomorrow)which explains the ending a little bit, but on further reading I discover the quote is from a 2nd or 3rd century called Pervigilium Veneris.  That's not even the half of it.  As I was reading I learned about a 19th century translation of the poem in a novel by Walter Pater called Marius the Epicurean.   That  story explains this shitty novel even further.  There are layers like that throughout the whole stupid book and I dont have the breadth of reading (nor the patience) to understand it on the level the author does. Still angry!  (You might argue that it has got me reading and researching but I am lazy and when I read I just want a good fucking story not a literary lesson).

      What a colossal failure my first foray back into reading was!  I finished The Magus last night after a hiatus on the weekend and I went to bed ANGRY.  What a shitty, shitty book.  I dont care if it's supposed to be a classic.  It's shitty.  It was really interesting and pushing some really good ideas and then completely lost it and became all about psychology and meta theatre. The ending was shit.  The writer was so impressed with their command of the English language that there are large tracts of self indulgent and self impressed waffle, not to mention it's one of the  cruellest  novels I've read, and the end offers no justification whatsoever for the ridiculous events surrounding the main character.  I could cut that book down by at least half and even then it would still suffer from coherency problems.  I get it but I dont.  I understand the psychology, the 'meta-theatre' - what I dont get is ridiculousness and the mental rape of the main character without any sort of philosophy behind it.  It stopped being about all the grand things it initially purported to be and in the end came down to whether or not the main character could punish a woman, after all this drivel about how men see the object, women see the relationship between objects and this is why women don't have wars and are therefore further ahead than men. Argh.  So, so angry.  I thought that if I just worked my way through all the nonsense there would be a nice payoff at the end.  Maybe I'm too lowbrow for this kind of work - I get it but I hate it.  Anyway I found  urlLink this review  of it so I know at least I'm not the only one who feels this way.  The salient point of that link is,   'It's an okay book, with some very fine writing and moments of real dramatic tension and mystery, but it could use some serious editing, much plot tightening and some philosophical clarity.'   I am really, really angry.  I hope the next book I read entertains me and isn't 650 pages of self indulgent rubbish.

      Its PMS week.  I have put on another kilo and am beginning to wallow.  To avoid the spiralling pits of hell I shall endeavour to keep busy.  Tomorrow my tasks are:  1 hour of DDR. Email MTIL and ask him to sign Centrelink form saying I dont work there now on Thursday. Mark exams and/or clean room.  That should do it.  Today I put in my timesheet, went to Centrelink, and then went fabric shopping which was satisfying.  I'm only wallowing because I got to the point where I could try nice new shirt on, noticed it was tight, and discovered I'd put on even more weight.  So demoralising.  I'm beginning to feel really really angry at frustrated because I havent been able to DO anything in my own home because I've had to stay silent for Raph or Mum.  So no DDR.  And no DDR means absolutely zero exercise.  Zero exercise at 5'2 means really fast weight gain.  The shorter you are the fatter you get.  I'm too pussy to exercise in the cold and I can't afford a gym membership and I bought the damn DDR mat instead of a gym membership anyway!  So I feel cooped up and trapped and frustrated and fat.  Man I just want a job so I can move out and play DDR as much as I want.  I dont want to feel angry, depressed, and fat!  But right now, at 11pm, my belly and I have to sit here and bear it.  That's what fucks me off the most.  The times I want to do something about it I can't.  And not just night time.  If it's the day Raph is studying or someone is asleep.  Or watching TV.  Maybe I could download Stepmania and use it on my PC but that means buying an adapter. Goddammit I am pissed off.  And Raph is going to China on Friday and I should be glad but I will miss him.  I just wish he didn't have to study at the fucking kitchen table :P

      I sat down to look at jobs before and started getting a bit depressed at the lack of them, then slapped myself silly.  What if I got a job right now?  Then I would have a job, 20 exams to mark, and websites to finish and a whole lot of stress.  So to slow myself down, I have to complete the exams and the websites first.  Then I can focus on getting a job.  And I dont mean just applying for the jobs that come out on websites.  I mean fixing up my ASP and SQL skills, putting my folio together, talking to recruiters and so on.  My first job will be to get a job!

      I was thinking about what I want to do with my life (as you do in any period of change), and remembered back to the time I wanted to be a doctor.  I remember standing on the steps of my ex boyfriends house, having not yet rung the doorbell talking to Dad (who had dropped me off there - he was in Australia and it was about 8 months before he died).  I asked him what he thought of me becoming a doctor and he looked at me sadly and said "Oh Katy you don't have to become a doctor to be a healer".  It was a strange response from him.  In my childhood I only really ever thought about becoming an astronaut, doctor, or writer.  My grandparents and family talked me out of becoming an astronaut, too hard they said, don't even bother, and as for a doctor that was out of the question or I would 'end up like my father'.  Writer was fine, nothing offensive about a writer, perfect for a middle class female.    What I didn't understand about my family was that they are the no-tall-poppies Australian family epitomised.  You are not allowed to be  too  good in my family, my father was hated by my grandparents because he was a doctor and therefore 'better' than their oldest son.  It is a pressure cooker of average, and anyone who tries to rise above it is quickly cut down.  As a child my grandmother and mother nicknamed me 'little miss average' and Mum told me it was because I was of average height and did average at school.  But I didn't do average at primary school.  My reports were always perfect.  I asked Mum about this a while ago and her response was 'oh yes but it was just a little Catholic school and you were totally unprepared for MLC'.  So now I can either get angry or I can do something about this.  I could whine about what I could have been with just a shade of encouragement from those around me, or I can realise now that at 25 I have a whole lifetime before me that I still very much have time to do with as I please.  I can be a tall poppy if I want.  It's very hard to swallow down all the 'you can't do it' advice, which is really them saying "we dont want you to do it" but not impossible.  I can't make any decisions now.  A whole new universe of what I could be has suddenly opened up and I need time to think.

      I feel like I've wasted the day, having got out of bed at midday and have not done anything really because of the shitty weather and the need to stay quiet for my bro while he studies.  It is truly amazing how many things you cannot do when silence is needed.  So tomorrow I will mission around, hit uni to drop in my timesheet (assuming the pay lady gets back to me and tells me how to write down exams on my timesheet), go to centrelink and hook up some cash while I'm hunting for a job, and then if that goes well and centrelink doesn't make me feel like killing I will go fabric shopping.  It will be interesting to see how much of tomorrow I get done!  There's some room cleaning somewhere too in there, but I'll only do it when it pisses me off enough and/or I can't find something. Oh yes I am putting off going to bed.  I dont know why.

      After handing in my essay I continued to work on The Shirt.  The Shirt is a lovely piece of fabric I managed to get the bolt-end of at Lincraft (who have nice mid range fabrics that they charge too highly for)which has printed flowers on a stark white background as well as some white thread embroidery.  It is a crisp, stiff white too and while you may be thinking Laura Ashley (erk) it's a little more contemporary than that.  In my quest for all that is not mass produced (and therefore meaningless), I've started applying it to my sewing techniques as well as the clothes I make.  Generally when you have a pattern, you pin it to your fabric and then with chalk or a special pen, mark out all the dots (that tell you where other pieces match up), and darts.  In that past I have just stabbed the thin paper away with a pin then rubbed in the chalk, removed the pattern and continued on, but its somewhat inaccurate and (I felt) gave my clothes that 'just learned to sew' look.  So instead I followed the French and instead of that I used tailors tacks.  It simply means I used doubled thread to mark all these things, but instead of drawing I sewed through all the layers with big loops which I cut when done and separated everything.  I was rewarded with spot on accuracy for all my markings!  Hooray!  Tell most sewers (bar dressmakers and tailors) you use this method and they will think you are  crazy  because it takes so much longer.  But I've always preferred the long way to the quick and dirty.  Anyway upon congratulating myself for this, I discovered I'd run out of another fabric necessary to make the shirt. Another reward - I get to to go fabric shopping tomorrow!  Yes, you just got a whole post about sewing.  Go read someone elses blog I am boring atm and loving it.  I've eaten two bowls of indomie noodles today, mee goreng and b-something goreng (satay).  My mouth is burning beautifully!

      Well they do to me.  I handed in my final assignment, a rehash of a previous one for a different subject.  First time I've ever done that and I felt shitty doing it but if I was out of energy before, I am really really out of energy now.  I felt nothing as I handed it in.  It's the last one, I should be happy, but to me the end came when I made my decision.  This part, is the end of the end if that makes sense.  Kind of like when I broke up with the ex, I'd made the decision a year before but was too chicken to carry on with it, so when I finally did all I could feel was relief.  Actually guilt too - I felt guilty for feeling so good about leaving!  At any rate, I've drunk way too much tea and my heart is racing uncomfortably.  My room, my house is a mess, my hair and skin are disgusting and filthy and I feel sluggish.  Under all this grime I feel good though.  It really  is  over for now.  I dont think there is anything worse than being unchallenged.  Its wears you down.  I feel like I can emerge now into new challenges and new unknowns.  Studying media and technology is certainly not a new fucking unknown that's for sure.  I want a job now so I can sink my teeth into doing well at that.  I can't function properly unless I have a serious challenge before me.  A life without goals and nothing to look forward is my worst nightmare and I came pretty close to that this semester.  I'm so glad it's over.  I'm really looking forward to the unknown now.

      Found my first semester Multimedia Project log.  The one I gave to my supervisor as a journal so I had to be as nice as I could about my team members.  Mind you it was quite heartening to read how much work I had actually done.  Unfortunately it wasn't the work of three people so it still got a low mark :P  urlLink Have a read  (its pretty boring), and Yean please please sugar please dont show this to anyone you know because everyone seems to know everyone at that uni!!!  (I know you wont I am para about the usual suspects finding out and created this blog to keep them OUT).  Backstory: I went to TAFE with Brendan (and also Steph), and the other girl in my group went to MLC with my sister who my sister described as 'one of the nerds I got to do my homework for me'.  I wish she had of been a nerd, her work in the end was useless.

      There I have a title.  My brother got free tix to a drum n bass gig tonight and offered them to his only friend, Alcoholic Joe.  Alcoholic Joe is the one who asked me if I was 'going clean' when I mentioned I didn't take pills anymore.  Alcoholics Joe is not happy unless he is off his head in some manner when not at work, and surrounds himself with other like minded alcoholics.  Back to the gig.  Joe said he would go but Raph called him tonight and he was all yeah, I just gotta do this first.  And then he had to do something else.  Raph says he's being weird because he has told Joe that he doesn't drink anymore and Joe can't hack it.  So he doesn't know if or when Joe is going to call and say he's ready.  Raph hardly ever gets to go out these days for lack of money and lots of study and he used to be a very social person and it kills me to see his only friend treat him like this.  He will make more friends - I have no doubt, but right now he has only this one.  God it makes me angry.  Raph takes it all with a level head and while I can see his disappointment I can also see that he's not taking it to heart too much.  Anyone who gets beaten up by ten lebos with pool cues isn't going to take something like this to heart but he really deserves better.  After everything he's been through he really really deserves better.  He sure as hell deserves to go out, drink some Red Bull and get down and dirty at a DnB shindig :P

      Is what I'm currently drinking.  I'm seriously thinking of turning off the titles.  I dont know what I'm going to write about before I start!  Saw Kill Bill 2 last night, it was good, dragged on a little in some bits but it probably only felt like that because I saw the other one straight beforehand and they're polar opposites in approach.  And yeah, go me for once again sounding like an idiot on my blog and coming across the opposite to what I was thinking.  I should probably explain myself better and slow down this stream of thought bullshit.  Okay yeah I got nothing to say, assignment due, two websites, some exams.  Gotta go to Centrelink next week to apply for benefits so I dont fall into the credit trap like last year.  Totally uninteresting I am.

      Applied for two jobs today go me!  I think knowing that I have suit ready to go helps.  The first was for Parks Victoria as a media relations officer, where I crapped on about my extensive knowledge of Australian media legislation and turned out to be four pages long (including cover letter) because I was addressing their selection criteria, and the other was for a graphic designer for a spa company in the SE suburbs.  You could not get more different jobs, I would love the challenge of the first one but the $50k pay rate isn't really encouraging to someone of my experience.  Still I can only try and that's the important bit.  I'm trying to have faith I'll get a good break eventually.  The other one I was totally cut out for but by that point I had wasted all my brainpower applying for the first one, although I didn't really need to do much for the latter.  I've had two cups of tea and am typing at a mile a minute and my brain is operating faster than normal.  Quite uncomfortable.  Last night I was thinking about the walls we create for ourselves and the defenses, and decided to get rid of the wall I've created for myself.  It's served me well for a very long time but I just dont need it anymore.  I dont need to be the inoffensive, slightly naive happy-cum-dumb person that I perfected for myself.  It worked well in getting bitches at MLC to realise that I wasn't a threat and they left me alone for it.  I dont need to make immediate and (obviously) stupid judgements in order to extract the 'she doesnt know what she's on about' response from people anymore.  I dont need to be passed over anymore, and I did for a very long time.  It worked very well for me, allowed me to hide in that nice safe cocoon where people just left me alone and didn't hurt me because they assumed I was a few beers short.  I'm not afraid of being hurt now.  That's a part of life.  And I'm better equipped than a lot of people to deal with it.  So I dont need my vague shell anymore, I can be myself now, for the first time since I was a child.  No need to hide under the blanket anymore, the monsters cleared out a while ago!

      So today I went suit shopping.  I made the mistake of bringing my mother.  I set some ground rules - no yelling across the stores at me and no telling the sales assistant my life story. First she tries to make me go to Jacqui E and I had spend 20 minutes imparting to her that I am 25 not 45, had a quick look in Country Road then got to the Table Eight outlet which is where I'd been heading for.  Only it's not exactly Table Eight.  It's clothes made for the outlet.  I tried a couple of suits on and quite liked a nice pinstripe one.  The cut was modern and it had some nice detailing but I had difficulty getting past the fabric.  The sales assistant was like, but it has STRETCH!, like elastane in fabric is the most magical thing in the world, and also pointed enthusiastically to the slightly offbeat velcro fastening like it was couture.  Mum was getting right into it and going YEAH!!!  I tried on another which made me look like a dumpy flight attendant, and asked the girl to hold the suit for me while I went off and looked elsewhere.  I looked elsewhere.  I tried Charlie Brown but they had nothing in my size.  I tried Witchery which didn't have anything.  I found some in Envy but they were so pink and girlish I couldnt even take myself seriously wearing them.  Ojay had nothing in my size.  I mentioned I might go to the Myer and DJs stocktake sales to look at nicer ones.  Then the barrage really began.  The barrage on how the one on hold was a nice suit, I could get a more expensive one when I had the money, how the cut was modern, how I looked good in it.  I pointed out that I might feel cheap wearing a cheap suit but no.  I should wait.  On five hours sleep Mum can be very persuasive but I stuck to my guns and said no no no.  Then my sister rang up and I made the mistake of telling her.  Then they both started up.  What was the matter with me, who can tell the difference, I should just get a cheap one now and buy an expensive one later, what was the matter with me.  So I got the suit.  They made good points...I guess it IS silly to go for a beautiful wool suit now but the horrible disappointed feeling that I gave into my family ONCE AGAIN is just eating me up.  I am powerless before them.  I tried really hard this time not to give in and stand by my convictions and once again they made me feel silly and spoiled.  Like I had no reason or right to want something good.  I told Mum that the suit I wanted in my mind would last me but she said I may as well just get a cheap one anyway.  Like everything I said just went straight through her.  The worst part is I feel even MORE silly for not having stuck to what I wanted.  But what really made me change my mind in the end was that I could look for that perfect suit for months.  Last time I looked in DJs they were all $800+ (the ones I wanted).  I just want to really stand out, and a good suit is part of the package.  I dont know why my Mum and sister are like that.  It's a weird tall poppy syndrome or something, or some crazy buying fanaticism that if something looks remotely good you immediately have to buy it.  I dont like buying clothes.  They on the other hand can't help themselves.  My sister and her boyfriend just buy shit and resell it all the time.  For some reason it reminded me of this guy we used to hang around with who used to grab you and press you against the wall and give you a hickey.  I remember him trying it on me and I desperately fought him off and my sister said 'oh just let him Katy!' But I didn't.  I roared and kicked until he stopped bothering.  I dont 'just let' anyone.  Therein lies the difference between her and me.  But this time I gave in.  I gave in because I'm tired and vulnerable and without perspective and have absolutely no idea of what is good for me right now, all I know is that I should act and not wait.  All is not lost.  Right now half my disappointment is exhaustion - AND I can always return the suit tomorrow.  Tonight I might make a trip alone to the stocktake sales and see if I can't do better.  This is going to be a bit of an expensive exercise if I do find something else and hopefully I can return this.  It was only $150 anyway, a suit jacket and a skirt.  And yes I look good in it, but it's not about looking good.  Any old sod can watch What Not to Wear and look good.  I want to look  finished .

      This morning I mentioned to my Mum that I'd only had 5 hours asleep because I sat up reading The Magus for half the night and she gave an exclamation and mentioned that my it's my aunts all time favourite novel and that my aunt had told Mum I might like to read it and my Mum had told her it probably wasn't my cup of tea.  I wish Mum knew me a little better - today she told me that I was the sort of person who liked Celtic stuff??!?!??! It's all very well for my sister and brother, they get along with her famously and are her favourites while my eldest brother belonged to my Dad and I just sort of fit awkwardly in the middle and have never really belonged to anyone except myself.  I find a strange kind of freedom in that - my brother and sister and Mum are locked into this crazy interdependence while my eldest brother is bound by his loss and the resulting grief and I'm just me.  Not to say that I don't grieve but my brother can't even  talk  about Dad even now.  I'm thinking about this stuff because the bit I'm up to in the book has the protagonist locked into a strange kind of dependence on the illusory and the truth behind it, and the antagonist is dependent on the former to keep the play running so to speak. It's causing me to think about who and what I am bound to.

      Will I read this book before bed.  I fell asleep quite happily but its talk of other realities and ghosts ensured I woke up an hour later and me lie there thinking ghosts were coming to get me.  I fell asleep about 5 and woke up at 10 with a stinking headache which is probably my fault for falling asleep on two pillows.  And sitting on my computer for the better part of yesterday.  I had a million things I wanted to do today and right now the thought of facing them is unbearable!

       Give Your Best Anyway - Mother Theresa    People are often unreasonable, illogical and self-centred.  Forgive them anyway!     If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives.  Be kind anyway!     If you are successful, you will win some unfaithful friends and some genuine enemies.  Succeed anyway!     If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you.  Be honest and frank anyway!     What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight.  Build anyway!     If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous.  Be happy anyway!     The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow.  Do good anyway!     Give the best you have, and it may never be enough.  Give the world the best you have anyway!     You see, in the final analysis, it is between you and your God.   It was never between you and them anyway.

      Perhaps now was not the best time to pick up and read a largely philosophical novel, right when I'm trying to enter the 'real world' and find a job.  This book is speaking to parts of me that I would rather keep quiet right now, as I don't have the time nor the energy to consolidate what I'm taking from it with the ordinaries of my life.  But then, who doesn't take books personally?  I haven't read for a while so I'll just have to get used to it.

      I dont have much left to do - exams to mark and a 3000 worder.  Last night I started reading The Magus by John Fowles - its at the top of my list because it's the last book I started to read and then didn't.  I thought the main character was a prat.  But when I started to reread it again last night I discovered he's a conflicted prat (I got a couple of chapters further than last time ;) and now I'm identifying with all his observations about himself and the world and am thoroughly enjoying myself.    I played DDR til I couldn't see today.  It's weird when you play a computer game and get progressively WORSE as you play it from sheer fatigue!  But I got some good scores (initially) and I'll get stronger so I can play more.  I was contemplating fabric shopping and/or suit buying today but this weather sucks so I'll settle for cleaning and maybe photographing stuff for ebay instead.  Also I am determined to finish this psychiatrist association website, I have made some headway with the client (who is lovely but indecisive) so now I just have to continue on.  Next time I do a quote I am quote six weeks for design instead of one.  That includes 'drafting'. :P

      All my idealistic hopes for the Labor party tightening cross-media ownership law has  urlLink been dashed .  It's a nice little theory - add pay TV to the list and you prevent Packer and Murdoch from moving into TV, but allow radio and news into TV.  Do these men not read their history books?  Do they not remember the ridiculous buying and selling spate of the 80s where licenses were bought and sold at ridiculous prices?  If these laws were brought in, Murdoch and Packer would simply sell their Pay TV stake and buy up TV/Newspapers.  Why can't they be just a shade more in depth and say that you cannot own a TV station and a newspaper, but you can own a radio and TV station, or a newspaper and radio station?  What the hell is wrong with that?  I'll tell you what's wrong with that.  That wouldn't get Labour the election.  What will get Labour the election is providing a clear and glaring loophole to Packer and Murdoch that will cause news media to start portraying their party in an election winning light.  What this means for me is that I will have hunt even HARDER to get independent news and it's difficult enough already.   Some time in the 1980s, an interview with Rupert Murdoch...  Interviewer:  So who do you think will win the next election? Murdoch: Ask my editors!

      So now that the fear is slowly disappearing, I am presented with a number of opportunities.  1.  Get a job.  A no brainer, and something I will attempt to do for now. 2.  Start a web/print design business.  I have good contacts that I still speak with, and have never been at a loss for work, but have never previously had the inclination.  Only problem is - I dont know shit about business. 3.  Start a custom linen business.  Don't ask, and dont steal it. 4.  Run away to dance school.  Don't ask.  That's all for now but it's lots more than I had earlier today.  I'm liking number one and number two.  Number two is something I could definitely pull off but is just a battle with time, patience, and confidence.

      Today I was gripped by a desire to apply for a Masters in Advertising at RMIT.  I filled out the application, and then began reading about each subject.  And as I did, I began to feel tired.  It's the same tired I got during semester.  And while it's a good course, much, much better than the one I'm doing now, I don't think I'd survive it.  I am exhausted from studying.  I have been studying since 1999 and I'd love to go further - but it's time for a break.  And that's what's scaring me the most.  I'm being torn away from everything I know and I get this episodes where I go running back.  I swing between depressed because I think my degree sucks, and really happy because I know I have good skills.  There is further study in my future...but right now I need to go looking for jobs.  Other wise I wont  know  if my degree really is useless or not.  And I'll spend all my time in study wondering.  I'm out of energy.  I need a 9-5 job for a bit so I can figure things out.  Breathing space.  I dont want to be unsure if I want a $35k debt.  The other thing is, I have no idea what my dreams are.  I've spent most of my life just surviving, be it on canned food and very sporadic child support or an abusive potential step-father who got rid of any seedling of my dreams, or a spirit crushing ex boyfriend, I never thought things could be better while I was living that life.  But I know they can be now that those things are in the past.  And for the first time in my life I get to make a wish.  Maybe I get to make it a little later but some people never get the chance at all and spend their whole lives just surviving.  I'm not going to take it lightly.  I'm going to take my fucking time and really think about what I can do in, and for this world.

      "I WAS GOING TO DO IT"  I HATE the phrase "going to".  It is bullshit.  People say it when someone does something for them or they haven't done something they said they would do.  I am instantly suspicious of people who use a passive verb in this way.  EITHER YOU'VE DONE IT, OR YOU HAVENT.  People say this like it magically absolves them from whatever they haven't done, like somehow by placing a nonexistent action into the future it's as good as done.  IF IT'S NOT IN FRONT OF MY FACE THEN IT'S NOT DONE.  It might be done in your mind because you were  going  to do it, but out here in my reality it's not there.  Next time you haven't done something you were supposed to just apologise.  And don't apologise then repeat the mistake.  There is nothing more insulting than being apologised to and then the person doing the same thing again - it means they weren't really sorry to begin with. Okay maybe it's more insulting to be told someone was 'going to' do something.  Fact is, it hasn't been done, and if you were 'going to' do it, you would have already so you're essentially lying and not taking responsibility for your inaction.  Try using an active verb instead like instead of,  "I'm going to clean my room today"  make it,  "I'm cleaning my room today".  Anyway rant over, I'm cooped up in my room because big bro is studying and I was stewing about all the things my sis says she is 'going to' do and then doesn't.  It really really pisses me off.  I can't stand people who not only dont do what they say they will, but also lie about it too.  Grr etc.

      So is  urlLink this  why Halliburton built the Darwin railway?  I am becoming increasingly cynical and disenfranchised.   In other news I got my new dance mat!  It's great!  I've been getting tons of perfect combos that I just wasn't getting on the older one.  I have to fix it up a bit though, the foam core is cheap shit so I'll have to visit Clark rubber and get some new stuff, and the base is very cheap stretchy foam crap that I can see is going to tear after a couple of weeks.  No idea what to replace that with yet and it's probably going to be a handsewing job because I dont trust my machine skills with something that large.  Also, Turbo B of Snap fame is the most amazing beatboxer EVER.  Fuck man he wasn't just doing rap beats he was doing techno as well complete with vocals...insane.  And last but not least, seeing as serps blog is an alien wasteland, I will recount this for you.  His Mum and Dad were at a medical conference on the Gold Coast last week, staying at the Versace Palazzo and who should also be staying there but Paris Hilton?  So serps Dad is in the foyer and walking out with Diane and Jodie (Mum and sis respectively), and Paris was coming in the opposite direction and wouldn't move out of the way.  Neither would Tom.  So they literally smacked into each other hehehe.  Jodie whispered to him who she was and how she shoulda moved but as he said "I dont know who she is and why should I get out of her way?" I've said it before.  I'm saying it again.  Tom is a _top_ bloke.

      Tonight I decided to have a crack at melt and pour soap.  Armed with simple directions and the tip "spray vodka on airbubbles", off I went.  Overboard.  Completely overboard.  At first I thought you were sposed to melt it quickly so I did and it foamed.  And I added essential oil.  And carrier oil.  And kaolin clay.  And mango butter.  Then I poured it into the molds.  Later on I found a sliver and tried to wash my hands with it.  It cleaned my hands, but didn't lather at all.  Further reading informed me that the melting point of soap is only 60c.  One other site said 120c.  Another said 185c.  Whatever, point taken, dont overheat your soap or it foams and you get airbubbles.  The upside is, I have super duper moisturising soap.  No way am I using it on my body.  My brother is happy though he has mega dry skin and will probably love it.  Oh and I got too enthusiastic with the essential oil too.  I used rosewood and mandarin.  It would be nice if I hadn't of used the maximum amount so that it didn't smell like Lush, but amateur.  Not to worry, my Mum loves that twangy aromatherapy smell so she's happy.  I got to make something, and both my Mum and brother like it, so it's a win-win-win ;D

      Words cannot express how much fun I had last night.  First of all serp and I stopped at Yoyogis for dinner for some teriyaki chicken, gyoza, and egg and rice then headed up to the Metro where the queue was farkin huge.  Anyway once inside serp suddenly had to rush to the bathroom, uh oh, bad gyoza, which was cool none of the acts had come on yet.  After that was all settled (and I was onto my third drink), C&C came on and one of the greatest nights of my life began!  Seriously, it is amazing to see live black women sing...and I'm not being racist, they have the most incredible voices.  The rappers were tops too, none of this skinny whiny white boy shit   By this point I was nicely drunk but suddenly had to run off to the bathroom - yup, the gyoza.  Then the KLF...not Bill and Jimmy the crazy button pushing money burning KLF, but Wanda Dee (the singer), and Jerome her husband (incidentally from the TV show fame), the rapper.  Where do I find words for this?  It was dead set amazing.  The whole club had their hands up, you couldn't fucking move.  I'll stop myself here, I wanted to be up the front, there were a few people up the front just standing there chin stroking, and seeing as I was drunk and wanting to dance out came my aggro streak.  It never gets out.  serp was frowning at me as I shoved people out of the way but god curse it I wanted to dance and they were wasting space just standing there and hoping they'd get noticed.  Who gives a shit about that?  Anyway it was a good thing I did (people would turn around to get nasty at me whereupon I'd shut my eyes and pretend I was off my head), because they started getting people up on the stage again, and before I knew it I was climbing up, and one of the dancers pulled me up (fortunately because I couldn't do it on my own I'm so weak :P) and next thing I know I'm shakin' it with one of the dancers in front of a thousand or so people, and then suddenly serp was up there too dancing and the KLF singer was talking to him and I was like OMFG I am dancing WITH the KLF (I can be such an exhibitionist when I want to be), and the BEST part was, was that I couldn't see the crowd for all the lights which was even better and erased any self consciousness I potentially might have had.  Anyway it felt like I'd been dancing for two seconds (it had been a whole song ;) when a bouncer was suddenly pushing me off the stage down the steps, good thing too because I had become completely disoriented and was more than happy to be elbowed off, although I could have stayed up there all night dancing!! After that my life was complete haha not really but it felt like it for a moment!  There's nothing quite like doing something completely out of the ordinary of your own volition.  The rest of the night was spent quite happily on cloud 9.  I feel like I've achieved a life goal - the time I got up on the stage at shed 14 and danced in front of 5000 people didn't count because I'd smoked coke with one of the lighting guys up the back thinking it was pot, which made it seem natural to behave like that.  Also I discovered that dancing drunk is a lot better than dancing on pills because you last heaps longer on beer and when it wears off you can still dance and dont feel like you need to shut out reality for a little while longer. After looking at those dancers last night, eh, I feel like packing it in and running away to dance school and becoming a pro street dancer.  However in Australia that means like, dancing for footy clubs and shit not in fly ass music videos and club nights but it's a nice little dream that I can fulfil by playing DDR and maybe signing up for street classes when I have some money. Along with the piano, singing, and sewing classes ;D

      Tonight I am going to the cheese machine that is SWEATFEST.  KLF, Snap, and C&C Music Factory, all staples of early 90s commercial dance scene, but not quite as cheese as 2 Unlimited.  I'm really looking forward to getting out and dancing to music I know and like.  It's quite a luxury.  I've finished my marking (bar one who sent me his cover sheet and not his essay)for now so I feel well equipped to go.  The bad thing is, is that my fitness level has dropped so badly that I can feel my heart beating whenever I do something remotely strenuous.  Not good.  It's so hard to do exercise though in this house because before you begin you must endure the 20 questions from my family as to what you are doing, where you are going, why you are going, followed by a comprehensive list of all the dangers you will encounter.  Hopefully my dance mat will solve all that!

       I dont know what to write about myself really. I love science fiction, I hate high minded science fiction groupies who only read the most intellectual techno babble driven drivel there is. I love technobabble and pulp. I love my computer although I treat it terribly, its cover is never on because I'm always doing something to it.  I love life, I love music and I love people. Not too big on being cool and all that junk and I pride myself on my geekdom. Damn straight. I used to hate myself for liking this stuff but in the end, it's who I am and I have to live with me for the rest of my life. So you can throw at me all your best four eyed fat assed knives but they'll all miss.   - About Me, Cyberchiq.com 2000  Damn, I sounded so much more alive back then :/  Time for a reawakening, or perhaps a revisitation.

      Just discovered I'm getting paid a bit over $100 than what I thought I was.  Once again, I will pay off my credit card, allocate myself money for the next fortnight, and put some into savings.  However rather than use the extra to buy myself something useless and temporarily satisfying, it's going straight into my savings.  It's curious because the more money I have, the more save and less I spend, whereas the less money I have, the more I want to spend it.  It's a security thing - if I'm not getting much I need to surround myself with crap, if I'm getting lots, I can live in the safety of the numbers in my ING account.

      We took the doggie here today because I was getting angry at my marking and  urlLink serp  got me out of bed amidst protest of it being freezing cold.  He knows me better than I know myself because once I got there I was so pleased!  First I fed my friend goat who submits himself to all sorts of pats, and two sheep came up then and ate the proffered grass furiously and also let themselves be patted.  Then Tiger got quite jealous so we moved on to the cows who had just had calves last month!  The calves were quite curious of Tiger which was reciprocated and I wish I had a camera!  One calf and Tiger were rubbing noses, it was just too much!  Then I tried to feed the calves but they were far more focused on licking me than eating what I was trying to give them.  They were very impressed with their own legs and their ability to gambol around on them   I like animals so much better than people.  You know where you are with animals.  So much so that I'm considering volunteering down there.  I dont care if I have to clean up shit really, it would just be nice being in that nice hidden place next to the yarra where you forget you're in the city.  No people save for the odd volunteer and more animals and organic produce than you can shake a stick at.  Plus its a wildlife conservation area.  I used to love going to that place when I was a little kid and still do (now that we've found it again, it's somewhat hidden!)   For the moment I'll settle with going to the farmers market they have there in a couple of weeks!  (To clandestinely pat animals!)

      This week has left me debilitatingly tired for some reason, my bones and my brain both feel exhausted.  Maybe its from hanging on by my fingernails to my sanity for this semester!  I counted up the number of students I had.  80.  80 students!  If anyone had of told me I'd have to manage 80 students I would laughed and run.  But I did it, and maybe not particularly well but they weren't massive failures, in fact some were great successes which was 99% them and 1% me.  MTIL says this is generally the case but puts it at 80/20.  So maybe it's just exhaustion from it being all over.  I'm definately not cut out for teaching first years although it's an excellent way of toughening up.  One more pay which kind of sucks although I'll have hit my savings target to cover the yearly bills (rego, insurance etc) even though I only started saving a month ago oops.  It was nice to have some money after years and years of nothing, nice to buy myself some new things.  But jeez if I get a proper job with work hours that stay at work and home time for myself I'm saving up like last time I had a proper job.  It's so satisfying.  And then once I've got myself sorted out I can focus on other crap that I've been ignoring since starting studying.    I got a bit of a wakeup call talking to Oates last night about child slavery and how there was no point trying to do anything about it because it's so rampant.  And he promptly pointed me toward the Adbusters shoes.  Woah.  A genuine alternative.  Then I thought about how different I am now, whereas a few years ago I was chanting and graffitying Crown with the rest of them at S11, and slightly misguided that I was, I had some  ethics  then.  I was going to go and teach people in third world countries how to use those wind-up laptops (even if jerkcity did make fun of it)!  But back then I was in a different environment.  I knew no one with similar views.  Those I did know frequently enjoyed pointing out that I was a burger flipping hippie and those were the nicer ones.  There were certainly no genuine alternatives  that I could find  and I certainly didn't have the means to create my own at the time.  So I let my 21 year old self, after 5 or so years of wanting to save the world, get discouraged, broke up with the ex and suddenly found myself faced with a whole new host of problems and buried all that stuff deep down where no one could find it, because in that environment no one wanted to see it. And then last night I discovered how deep my apathy truly ran.  And then I saw that adbusters page.  A genuine alternative.  And now I'm thinking there are plenty of things  I  can do that child slaves also do.  I can sure as hell sew.  I love the concept of community recycling  a la  Camberwell Market.  Now that I have the skills, all I need is some money (aka a job) to create my own genuine alternative.  People still have to make the choice.  I've never been one to force my ideology on anyone.  After S11 I've kept them to myself because I'm more interested in hearing what others have to say.   But an alternative is one thing I wont hide away.  It's a good idea - I dont have the power to stop what's happening, but I think that I do have the power to provide more choices for people.  I don't care if people wear Nike.  I certainly wont have a go at them like I saw some people doing at S11.  It is ultimately your choice.  But I think there's a lot of people who believe it's the only choice.    A point to note though, feel free to buy clothes made in India, they have solid anti child slavery laws, and although something like 60 million children are being exploited, the massive textile unions in that country ensure there are few (if any) children in that industry.  Just dont buy any carpets, brass, glass and locks from there because thats where the child workers are concentrated. I dont know which is worse though, working with industrial sewing machines or glass :/

      Inspired from my snap judgement that Miss Universe must be an aspirational bogan because she likes footy AND ballet, I present a list of my likings so you can make snap judgements about me!  (But please dont tell me them, it's quite alright to think them though:)  0.  Hugging  urlLink serp ! 1.  Drinking tea.  One of my favourite pastimes! 2.  Going to big big big dance parties full of nice people. 3.  Travelling.  Anywhere.  Two suburbs from here or two countries. 4.  Driving.  Gotta love driving.  Especially through back streets at night. 5.  Buying expensive stuff at a significant discount.  Okay this is petty but it makes me feel smug especially since Sasha was mental about buying expensive stuff and consequently whining about having no money.  She has weird self worth issues.  If it costs a lot of money and she owns it, she feels like she is worth more. 6.  Buying cheap stuff.  If I get it cheap, I feel worth MORE because it means I was smarter about it!  I freely admit I have a bit of a shallow side. 7.  Dancing.  Corny I know but deep down - who doesn't love dancing? 8.  Talking to people who are good.  You can't truly appreciate this one until you have good friends. 9.  Camping.  How can you not love camping? 10.  Staring at the stars (when I can see them).  There is nothing better than lying there and pretending you're on an alien planet looking for earth. 11.  Watching movies.  Preferably science fiction. 12.  Reading books, which I've only just started doing again.  Trying NOT to read science fiction which is so difficult because then I just tend to switch to nonfiction. 13.  Drawing.  Haven't done it for a while. 14.  Sewing.  So, so satisfying. 15.  Making websites.  Although as I get older I tend to get more discouraged! 16.  Reading anything and everything I can online! 17.  Wandering around any city.  Cities are truly alive I think! 18.  Eating. 19.  Bitching and making snap judgements about people I dont know.  I'm not going to pretend I dont do this!  BUT I can't stress enough that I treat every person equally until they prove me wrong or give me a reason to keep going.  Everyone makes judgements.  What you do with those judgements makes all the difference. 20.  Blogging! 21. Learning words from another language then talking to a native speaker in that language and having them understand me!  What a rush! 22.  Learning from people.  I think you can learn from every person you meet.  You dont have to take on their views but you can learn from their perspective. 23.  Playing with my dog.  A no brainer! 24.  Daydreaming.  My head is like 20 epic movies a day.  More if I'm not tired! 25.  Collecting makeup.  I've only just started.  It's quite satisfying for the moment! 26.  Learning, I love it.  I really really do.  I dont think there's nearly enough time to learn about everything I want. 27.  Cooking dessert. 28.  Constantly improving myself.  I dont mean looks or clothes.  I mean me.  It's difficult and traumatic and ultimately satisfying. 29.  Arguing.  For the sake of it.  Preferably on usenet.  Sometimes I can go too far and not realise that people are sensitive.  For someone so sensitive I can be quite insensitive in an argument because I get caught up in the process of arguing itself.  It doesn't really matter if I believe what I'm saying, I just love a good challenge. 30.  Which brings me to...challenging myself!  Man, that was really boring.  There you have it.  A boring, normal Australian.  But that's okay, I will never, ever take boring for granted ever again.

      Two things of interest, last night I saw Day After Tomorrow with  urlLink serp  and really liked it.  Okay I cried most of the way through the movie but I was all emotional anyway and I still thought it was great.  Very powerful.  Makes me happy I live in Australia!  The second thing was at dinner the other night, I was chatting to Imam about our respective religions, he is a Sunni Muslim and he was telling me that when he travelled to America he noticed they were quite full on about their religion, whereas in Australia he noticed that a lot of the churches were empty on Sunday.  Also some idiot Australian teacher told him in Indonesia that it was considered a taboo in Australia to talk about religion?!  News to me!  Anyway he said that in Indonesia religion is so important as a topic of conversation, people immediately want to know what religion you are to the point where it's mandatory to have a religion on your ID card, you can't put 'none'.  I wonder if you would be allowed to put Jedi?  Anyway Imam said he'd asked some Aussie guys what religion they were and they had responded with 'footy'.  He said he was surprised and didn't quite believe him until he went into the city last weekend and got up in the post footy crowds and was amazed!  So funny to see your country through the eyes of another, especially an Indonesian Sunni who is shorter than me! He is such a nice guy though I hope I keep in contact with him.  I told him I appreciated talking to him about Islam because I didn't know a thing about it and there's not much in the Australian media about it. The next day I was sitting in a cafe with my Mum and she comes out with "I think Australia is in serious danger of being invaded by Indonesia". Bad move Momma, and I let her have it.  I told her that her generation seems to have been poisoned by this idea and I had no idea why given they were a collection of islands, not a whole continent, that they are very territorial about where they come from, i.e. the argument that no Javanese is going to want to call himself Australian etc etc etc and she shutup.  She desperately tried changing the subject but she should know better than to get me started! ;D

      I am turning into my mother.  I am completely addicted to buying expensive designer makeup.  It's not like I even want to wear it really, most days I just dag around in whatever and no makeup, and I'll wear it if I'm going out.  No, my motivations are far far more shallow.  I like the cases they come in...I like the logos and the shapes and the weight and the heavy black or heavy gold.  I got my  urlLink Jean Patou Lipstick  the other day.  I bought it because he designed in the 1930s (this is a rerelease), for the flappers to look like a cigarette lighter.  It's a beautiful design, and nice and heavy and cold in my hand, and really does look like an old world cigarette lighter!  I love semi ornate stuff.  I dont think you can get that one in Australia and even if you could it would be around $80.  I paid $35.  I love  urlLink strawberrynet !  I love Hong Kong!  Importers of ridiculous amounts of cosmetics and designer ranges!  I could never get like this about clothes.  I was looking in shops in Victoria gardens the other day going "I'm not paying $40 for that!  I could make that for $10!" which is a bit problematic because while I  could , I probably wont.  So here I have found some materialism.  It's not clothes, or homewares, its makeup.  Well, makeup in nice expensive casing.  I wouldn't go out and pay $400 for creme de la mer regardless of how good it was for my skin because the bottle is ugly.  Actually I wouldn't pay $400 for skin cream anyway.  $35 for a lipstick is one thing, paying full price or over $100 is quite another!

      Nothing like sleep for perspective and some positive words from those you actually value.  When I was 13 my brother used to tell me I needed to lose weight and would tell me I had to do this and eat that and it was very crushing.  So I was very surprised last night when I told him about the Indian guy and he reacted with surprise and anger.  So did my Mum.  The two people I would have thought would have agreed with him.  And then when I woke up this morning my Mum said he was nasty and unhappy.  Even more of a shock.  So today I'm okay.  Maybe because I'm older it's easier to deal with or maybe its everyones unflagging positivity exactly when I needed it most - I dont know.  But my self image has returned back to normal, I no longer feel like the marshmallow man and I'm happy about that.

      Today we awoke to my dog standing on our chests, demanding we get up and give him something to eat.  We ate last nights pizza then got into the car and drove to Ringwood.  Ringwood?  I wanted to visit Reverse Art Truck, a community recyling iniative that resells industrial waste (not like chemicals, but more like wood, wrapping paper, clothing labels, all sort of things), to artists and primary schools.  I'd heard they had fabric offcuts there so the very lovely  urlLink serp  came with me and we passed many car dealerships and Eastland and I got grumpy about whereis give me dodgy instructions but we made it there.  A bit of history; Reverse Art Truck used to be Reverse Garbage Recycling and in the mid nineties was a favourite source for people who did rave decor.  Including me because I set up a couple and used many of their paper, foam, and wood products to build up chillout rooms.  There used to be three of them and I used to go to the Footscray one, which was huge and was since closed down.  So I was a little disappointed to find it squeezed into a much smaller place.  This is the last one left (they dont make much money) and I didn't find anything I wanted.  Basically you pay $15 and they give you a garbage back and you can stuff it with anything you want.  They had a lot of leather soles I noticed!  But the offcuts were too small so I didn't get anything - the adventure was in getting there ;D  After that we visited Brandsmart in Nunawading just for a look but I dont feel like buying anything lately for some reason.  On the way back I did something I should have done a while ago.  I turned off the Maroondah Hwy, and parked down a street opposite the cemetery where my grandma (who died 2 years ago), my grandpa (who died 23 years ago), and my dad (6 years in December) are buried.  I hadn't been there since my Grandmas funeral when we put Dads ashes in with her.  I just did it on a whim and didn't think much of it.  I thought I'd go to the grave, take a look, and leave.  But when I got into the cemetery it was so, so quiet and I was in this field of grey marble.  The closer I got to the grave the harder it became to walk forwards and the more I tried to find it the more I didn't  want  to find it.  But I did.  I cried a bit and stood there frozen while my beautiful  urlLink serp  tidied it up.  I couldn't move.  I didn't realise how hard that was going to be until I was standing there being frozen.  After that  urlLink serp  put his arm around me and we left.  When I was a child I used to play in Kew cemetery and run around and look at the stones and wonder how people died.  Some of them were so old that the writing had completely worn off and no one was left alive to come and fix them up.  But graves were for other people.  People I didn't know.  I never thought I would be a person who had a grave related to them.  Sounds funny doesn't it.  At any rate, I decided I didn't like graves, or graveyards.  In fact I hate the whole idea.  They are so heavy, they anchor you to that persons death and not their life.  There is nothing spooky about them, they are slabs of marble and cement designed to weigh down the unstable earth.  They truly are, if you'll excuse the morbidity, dead weights.  When I die I want to be cremated and scatterd so there is no big cold piece of stone that people will come to visit.  I want people to look up when they think of me, not down.  Moving along, we went home and had lunch and discovered the Hayao Miyazaki movie I wanted to see at the Melbourne Film Festival was on YESTERDAY (argh).  We were going to that and the State of Design Ready Made Market, which fortunately was still on.  So we headed into the city, parked (for free!) in Flinders Lane and were making our way to Russell St when I found on the side of a door, a sign pointing upstairs in an old building saying there was some kind of sale that had fabric.  We went up the stairs and found a trendy little warehouse space with trendy arty people mooching around looking hip (not really buying) and some clothes on racks.  The clothes were okay, nice fabric and construction, bit too offbeat for me.  Plus they were lazily constructed.  I wanted one top but it was an XL dammit.  The fabric was boring and probably overpriced.  But what caught  my attention, was that they only had  two  machines in there.  And one of them was for sale.  I would have bought it if it wasn't an industrial one (I'm not ready for the power and the speed ;).  But if all you need is a small studio space and a couple of industrial sewing machines (which are by no means expensive), then why aren't I doing that!  I could make nicer stuff than them.  Unfortunately, idyllic as it sounds I simply cannot deal with the people in that industry.  Maybe one day.  But not now.  However, it was a  huge  boost to me, just to see it in practice, and see how much better I could do than these too cool for school design hipster wannabes.  After that we headed over to Federation Square, to the market.  The market was part of the State of Design Festival going on (I am eternally interested in design), and had new designers stuff in there.  It was mainly clothes and homewares and some abstract stuff but interesting.  A few unis were there, Monash, Melbourne, RMIT, and Swinburne but their stalls all seemed to be about pushing their courses than their students work.  Melbourne had some good pics of student work up, Swinburne some folders of design work, but Monash and RMIT were all course brochures which was annoying because I love looking at student design work.   I also discovered, that with many of the clothes there, again I could do better.  I made the biggest fool out of myself too nearly falling over I laughed so hard because  urlLink serp   leaned into me and said "Have you noticed how the people here talk like this" and affected this nasally disaffected voice which epitomised how the trendy design people were talking to each other.  I nearly wet my pants because it was so so true.  Anyway it was pretty interesting and I'm glad I went although people seemed to be applauding themselves for being in the know about it and it wasn't  that  good.  After that we checked out Federation Square a bit more, then headed towards the Hawker Bazaar because I wanted to get a drink and show  urlLink serp .  Rather than take Swanston St, we went through all the little arcades because I looooooooove walking through them.  I dont know why, they're so warm and interesting to look at.  On Collins we had to return to the main road though because I saw my millionaire uncle and he was yelling at his wife and I think he saw me so I turned and walked off because he and his wife like to pretend they are the Perfect Couple (tm) and I felt embarassed for them.  They're twats but I dont want them to feel badly because they've seen me and havent been perfect.  Hawkers place good, we just got some drinks then went back through the arcades again and stopped at Laurent where  urlLink serp  got one of their insanely rich chocolate custard filled donuts (I have one bite and feel ill) and I got a Raspberry Frangipane and the girl had no idea what I was talking about it when I asked for it (even though it was labelled that way) until I said tart instead of Frangipane and then she took a million years putting it in a special Laurent box and crap and all I wanted to do was EAT the damn thing not look at its stupid packaging.  After that we went back to the car and came home and took my darling doggie for a walk because he hasn't been walked in ages and I had to return a library book.   urlLink serp  has collapsed in my bed and may possibly be asleep and the dog is sitting next to me and staring intently (half an hour till dinner time).   What a day huh!  It felt really good to go and do things I hadn't ever done before.  I realised how much I dont know my own city and have become committed to investigating every tiny little piece of it.  I do this when I'm overseas - why not in my own country?   And just to keep you up with my annoying duality, on the train to  urlLink serps  last night I thought I would rent Empire Records because  urlLink serp  has never seen it.  Surprise surprise, I got to his house and he told me that Empire Records was the late movie for Saturday night...  I hope wonders never cease :)

      Last year the nutty lady who lives out the back came to our front door complaining about a neighbour who lived in our street called Jenny Jones.&nbsp; We had no idea who the hell Jenny Jones was.&nbsp; I forgot about it until last weeks Spanish class where there was a lady called Jenny Jones (who doesn't live where I live).&nbsp; A few days ago on Nova they were all joking and laughing about a lady called Jenny Jones.&nbsp;  In Masters we had a guest lecture from a Robert Morsillo who worked at Telstra.&nbsp; He had completed the same Masters the year before and had written a thesis on the digital divide and aborigines - it was part of our reading.&nbsp; Today I moved into the other side of the office.&nbsp; Right after my phone was reconnected it rang.&nbsp; It was Robert Morsillo.&nbsp; Looking for the guy who used to occupy my phone number. However, it's stopped being weird.&nbsp; I think it may have something to do with me going from having contact with very few people, to me being in constant contact with people.&nbsp; Something about numbers.&nbsp; It makes sense in an odd kind of way to me.&nbsp; Like probability or something. So let us tally up the 'clues', as I like to call them, that the universe (for lack of a better word, if you're religious you could say God I guess), has given me. We have: The guy on the tram who looked like my Dad.Kelly from Vietnam.The guy reading Neuromancer.Lots of 3's.Jenny Jones.Robert Morsillo. Feel free to solve the puzzle.&nbsp; I certainly can't.&nbsp; Yet.&nbsp; But I'm not trying.&nbsp; I'm waiting for more to be revealed.&nbsp; It's quite exciting!&nbsp; Every day I wake up wondering what strange coincidence will appear next.&nbsp; I'd be terribly disappointed if I was in The Matrix though so dont say that. P.S Yean I finally found the underground hawker place!&nbsp; Only took me like a year :P

      A couple of things have happened recently that have caught my attention.&nbsp; The first was in my first week of work, when I got on the tram and sat down facing a guy who looked uncannily like my Dad.&nbsp; I kept peeking at him over my shitty MX until I got bored.&nbsp; The next day I got on the tram and sat in the same seat, and he was sitting where he was the day before.&nbsp; That was kinda weird.&nbsp; Later that week I met a girl at the tram stop called Kelly.&nbsp; She just started chatting to me and I learned her whole life story.&nbsp; How she came here from Vietnam 9 years ago, learned English, done adult VCE and did comp sci at RMIT.&nbsp; This morning I finished reading Methuselah's Children by Robert Heinlein very hurriedly while walking to work (and nearly crashing into people).&nbsp; Usually I finish reading when I get off the train but today I didn't stop.&nbsp; When I caught the tram home, I pulled out&nbsp;the other book I had in my bag, William Gibsons Neuromancer (rereading it).&nbsp; There was a man standing opposite me reading the same book.&nbsp; Same cover and everything.&nbsp; On their own these things are meaningless.&nbsp; Perhaps they still are meaningless!&nbsp; But taken together it's very strange.&nbsp; At least I've stopped seeing so many 3s.&nbsp; For a while there (right before I got my job and for a little while after I got it) they were everywhere.&nbsp; I take that as a good sign, it usually means things are changing for the better.&nbsp; The last time I saw so many 3s was when I was getting together with  urlLink serp .&nbsp; Its not just on their own either.&nbsp; Usually the clock is 3:33 or a phone number is 9xx3 3333.&nbsp; Stuff like that.&nbsp; They repeat and repeat and repeat!&nbsp; I find it reassuring.&nbsp; But now I'm finding duplicity and I have no idea what that means.&nbsp; It's not repetition, its duplication.&nbsp; It certainly makes my tram rides interesting.  Anyway, silly superstition aside, I have placed myself on a SHOPPING BAN.&nbsp; The other day I bought this bra online I have wanted for three years.&nbsp; Today I bought jewellry in the city and when I got home I had an email from the  urlLink bra place  saying they were having a 60% of sale! ARGH!&nbsp; So I bought the matching undies and some PJs :D&nbsp; And my Vogue pattern arrived today, the Amazon order yesterday, and the perfume the day before!&nbsp; I must admit it makes a lot of sense purchasing online.&nbsp; Your pay isn't eaten straight away and you keep receiving stuff throughout the course of the month.&nbsp; Which is great when you get paid monthly :P&nbsp; I'm not overspending, but I am uncomfortable with all these purchases!

      I started off today a little depressed because it felt like an eternity till I could see  urlLink serp  and do my own thing again but it quickly diminished over the day.&nbsp; I only had one cup of tea - I completely forgot I needed caffeine!&nbsp; I didn't do much today though, it's hard to on Monday but I did have a couple of meetings which were interesting.&nbsp; The Bitch had neglected to let a creative agency about our font requirements a month ago when they asked, and today she told me it was my job to liase with them.&nbsp; Surprise surprise I discover they dont know and I tell them we can't do it and they got cross at me.&nbsp; Not my fault but annoying nonetheless.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a good whinge about creative-agencies-who-think-the-sun-shines-out-their-arse - the rest of the office found it pretty amusing.&nbsp; Anyway I have plenty of work to do now which is good, it gets rid of the day quicker.&nbsp; The universe has this funny little habit of giving me presents when things go bad, but I deal with them.&nbsp; Today I came home to find my perfume waiting on my bed for me!&nbsp; I love the  urlLink strawberrynet  boxes, they always have a ribbon around them :)&nbsp; Much as it's a bit tiresome and annoying to get up early and sit all day at a computer, I do like this job.&nbsp; It's let me see how undeveloped I am, and how good I  could  be.&nbsp; The skills I get out of this place will be very valuable, and hopefully I can figure myself out some more while I'm there.&nbsp; I'm not lacking in enthusiasm or passion...just  direction !

      Last week I discovered I dont have anywhere near enough clothes for work.&nbsp; I dont have many clothes anyway because while I like clothes, I can't really afford them (well, couldn't), and have never been interested enough in them to actually work for the money to get them.&nbsp; Anyway I spent all of my first pay (not counting weekly allowance)&nbsp;on rego and credit card and some necessities (warm coat, perfume ;)&nbsp; so buying them was out of the question.&nbsp; Especially since buying them means going to places like Witchery and forking out $70 for a fucking cardigan or $120 for a pair of pants.&nbsp;  urlLink serp  suggested I go fabric shopping and make some work clothes...and I was like, oh yeah I can  buy  fabric!&nbsp; I could buy clothes too but I dont like shelling out big bucks for no good reason so first we went to Lincraft - that was almost as bad as Witchery, $50 per metre for 'wool blend' suiting.&nbsp; On Saturday we went to Spotlight and I found some brown polyester that had the right hang to it (very important!) but was shitty polyester.&nbsp;&nbsp;I found some charcoal wool blend suiting that was $15 a metre...I had $30 left for the weekend and needed two metres!&nbsp; Hah.&nbsp; I wasn't going to do it (I dont generally spend that much on fabric) but  urlLink serp  pointed out that it was much nicer and not that much more expensive and that he would make sure I ate that night.&nbsp; Let me just pause to once again go on about how  urlLink serp  is THE BEST!&nbsp; I ended up buying it and I'm so glad I did because I've nearly finished making it into a pair of pants and they are  lovely .&nbsp; The fabric is 80% wool and 20% polyester - all wool would be nice but you can't get fabric to be so fluid without some synthetic in there.&nbsp; They're wide legged and flop all over the place...and I have *no* shoes to go with them.&nbsp; Mum started dictating that I spend next pay on shoes ('sif, I found some nice ones in Big W for 20 bucks anyway).&nbsp; I'm not much of a shoe person.&nbsp; I tried on a pointy pair the other day because I am also running out of shoes for work and...yuck.&nbsp; I dont know how people can wear them.&nbsp; I thought they looked bad on other people but on me they just look lame.&nbsp; Gayness.&nbsp; Anyway I'm so glad  urlLink serp  talked me into the nicer fabric.&nbsp; I can be a bit like my Mum at times, get something cheap and nasty and hold of the nicer stuff for a 'better time'.&nbsp; Hah!&nbsp; Or as Susan Coolidge would say "But alas! Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow!"   That being said I think I'm gonna order fabric online from now on because Lincraft and Spotlight have a shit selection and the lady in Spotlight had to cut extra fabric for me because the managers had the bolt double folded completely off grain.&nbsp; If fabric isn't on grain (lengthwise and crosswise threads all running nice and straight) then your clothes will look like shit.&nbsp; I lost ten centimetres straightening it up (pulling a thread from the fabric and cutting&nbsp;along the resulting line) as it was but that was fine because she'd given me plenty extra.&nbsp; We had a good bitch about psycho sewers because she gets yelled at a lot and told how to do her job lolol.

      Looking back over the last couple of posts, and coming out the other side quite unscathed and in a good mood, I realised that this is  exactly what I wanted .&nbsp; I'm not entirely sure how much sense it makes, getting a job to give yourself time to think and reflect but its working.&nbsp; This is causing me to have a good look at myself, and find out what makes me tick.&nbsp; The last post was all about traps - and there are so many!&nbsp; It's such a different set to uni and they're everywhere.&nbsp; I see people around me living in them, my Mum can't organise herself because she gives into her after work tiredness and has done for 20 years, Sasha can't get overseas because she gives into her dissatisfaction and buys stuff to make herself feel better, some people overeat, some don't eat enough - who am I to think that I will be the one to find a balance when these people have worked for years?&nbsp; But I have to try.&nbsp; I have to learn how to balance.&nbsp; Slowly the story of my life unfolds and I inch closer to finding out what it is I want, and need to do.&nbsp; I have to stay on that tightrope to find out.&nbsp; I can't fall into the biggest trap of living from day to day events.&nbsp; It's very good to take each day as it comes, and very bad to rely on each day as it comes!&nbsp;   A lady at work was a bitch to me last week because I forgot something she told me.&nbsp; I felt stupid.&nbsp; I am not stupid though, I have a lot of products to remember.&nbsp; I went home that night and felt as though I would never get anywhere, and that they would probably want to fire me.&nbsp; The next day I found out that everyone hates her and that she's incompetent.&nbsp; She's nice one minute and a bitch the next (a sure sign of incompetence!)&nbsp; Later in the week I was given the job of redeveloping the process of how our team is given work to do, to make it better.&nbsp; And I did it and loved it.&nbsp; I love making things work better!&nbsp; So another piece of the story gets revealed to me, I still don't know what i means, but I do feel better.&nbsp; I love to make things work, and I love to improve on things.&nbsp; That's not a life mission by any means but it's a beginning.&nbsp; This is what I couldn't find doing Masters.&nbsp; I find it ironic that in an environment where one is supposed to developed - I stopped moving.&nbsp; I felt so stuck and bored and unhappy there.&nbsp;&nbsp; And here I am in an environment where I use my brain for other peoples dreams and not my own - and I'm growing faster than I can see.&nbsp; I have time to think now.&nbsp; I think while I'm developing stuff, and getting artwork approved, and writing thousands of lines of HTML.&nbsp; I think on the tram home, and before I go to sleep at night.&nbsp; Doing Masters, all I could think about was how much I didn't want to go to the next class, how much the assignments sucked, how I didn't want to run into MTIL, and how I was going to face another class of whiny students.&nbsp; Now, all I have to do is get up, go to work, and come home.&nbsp; The rest of the time is mine.&nbsp; It's not as much as I got at uni, but the headspace is greater.&nbsp;  I don't think I'm going to fall into that trap.&nbsp; I'll stay here until I stop growing and learning from it.&nbsp; When I get stuck again, I will move.&nbsp;  In other news,  urlLink serp  and I started Spanish lessons last Thursday!&nbsp; First we went to dinner to celebrate my lovely mans getting into double degree goodness and then we went to class.&nbsp; I had so much fun!&nbsp; They got us all to say our occupations in Spanish, I think mine was communicadoras sociale, but dont take my word for it because the dopey Columbian Spanish teacher Diego&nbsp;had to check his dictionary several times and frequently crossed out what he had written on the board.&nbsp; There was a weaver from America&nbsp;(can't wait to get to know her!), a pharmacist, a bartender, journalist, lawyer, pharmacist, town planner, photographer and a few others like me with weird job titles that stumped the teacher.&nbsp; The best one though was the stay at home Mum because the teacher told us that there was a special phrase for that which translated to "master of the house" - hehe she liked that a lot!&nbsp; Anyway I had an absolute ball and got my tongue twisted and made several hilarious mistakes when asked to speak aloud to the class.&nbsp; Some people pissed me off though I had to admit.&nbsp; They obviously weren't listening and instead of having a go when the teacher got around to them (everything was written on the board), they would just shrug and say "I dunno" and he would be like "no no just try to say it" and they would like up a bit stubbornly and repeat "I dunno".&nbsp; This was especially true of the bartender who claimed she was learning Spanish because she had been "roped into" (her words) going all over Europe with her boyfriend (oh boohoo!) and that he could speak a bit of Spanish and she felt she should learn so she could "compete".&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; I wonder if everyone will be back there next week?&nbsp; I chatted to the girl next to me for a while, she was lovely!&nbsp; She's going to Spain next month and her name is Jenny and she's a human resources manager and was really nice.&nbsp;  urlLink serp , Jenny and I all had a good laugh at ourselves (the rest of the class must have thought we were nuts) but&nbsp;I also learned quickly because&nbsp;I wasn't taking it terribly seriously or worrying too much about being in a classroom (you get over that after going through Tafe and uni I reckon!).&nbsp;    urlLink serp  and I talked today too about our goals too which helped me see that this job (and don't get me wrong, it is a very good job with good people) was just a means to and end.&nbsp; So now I have a savings goal and a travel goal and future career goal, all of which are still cooking, I'll talk more about them when they've solidified a bit more.&nbsp; It felt good to talk it all out :)&nbsp;  urlLink serp  always makes me feel better!

      Don't ever fall into the trap of thinking that this 9-5, live for the weekend life is forever.&nbsp; Don't ever think you can't take that year off and backpack around the world.&nbsp; There are always more jobs.&nbsp; Don't ever be afraid of taking the windy road instead of the straight one.&nbsp; Remember this post when you near that trap.&nbsp; Dont become caged by trappings of belongings.&nbsp; It's too easy.&nbsp; Do this job, play this role for now.&nbsp; It's a means to an end, not a destination.&nbsp; No job, no title is a destination.&nbsp; Your work is for  you  to work towards what you want.&nbsp; Not for you to live for their goal.&nbsp; Never, ever, simply work to buy toys.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; Which brings me to my life goals as of this year (in no particular order): &nbsp; Walk across Spain in a few years time. Learn Spanish (starting on Thursday!) Live overseas. Learn piano. Write a book. Learn Mandarin Chinese. Get to couture standard. Learn to make jewellery. Get a rad body. Help people  somehow . Learn to sing. Learn maths!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Find out what's out there. &nbsp; It probably seems silly :)&nbsp; I write them down every year and they're always a little different.&nbsp; I wonder what my goals will become when I've done these? &nbsp; (I had a bad day at work, just need to remind myself why I'm there ;)

      My Mum came home at midnight last night, long after I was to be asleep and kept me awake for a long time crashing around, consecutively heating wheatpacks (as opposed to together) and generally making me mad.&nbsp; I have PMS at the moment so it made me doubly mad.&nbsp; Anyway tiredness + pms is not, not good.&nbsp; The weekend (lots of walking) &nbsp;had left me physically exhausted and the lack of sleep last night made today nearly unbearable.&nbsp; I couldn't look at my monitor for more than two minutes at a time and I had an awful headache and the most insane waves of dizziness.&nbsp; I've never felt dizzy like that except when drunk and it was a little scary.&nbsp; It got better throughout the day after I ate a mandarin and some yoghurt.&nbsp; The more I ate the better it got so it was probably a sugar low.&nbsp; But it was really horrible.&nbsp; I tried not to talk to anyone which was kind of unworkable as (among other things)&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;the liason between operations and sales.&nbsp; When 5pm rolled around I was too tired to even be happy!&nbsp; I must buy earplugs.&nbsp; Anyway today I was thinking about the piece of writing I ever wrote.&nbsp; It wasn't a hardcore science fiction story with guns blazing and big ships or a pretentious piece written to satisfy my teacher, overloaded with symbolism and a sacrificial lack of self indulgence.&nbsp; In fact it was a two paragraph piece, my first in class&nbsp;work requirement at TAFE.&nbsp; I dont have it anymore (it was handwritten).&nbsp; It was a description of a waiting room.&nbsp; I had just come out of a job I hated and used everything from there, the smell of the coffee, fluroescent lighting, and beige and grey surfaces.&nbsp; Everything I hated about my work was in that, with no superlatives or judgement.&nbsp; I read it out to my class and everyone went silent.&nbsp; Someone said 'wow'.&nbsp; I haven't written anything like it since.&nbsp; I've never hated anything in that way.&nbsp; Then I thought about how hard it must be to be a writer!&nbsp; To summon up those hates and loves and then write them without judgement and discover if they can stand on their own.&nbsp; I learned a lot about the technicalities of writing at TAFE.&nbsp; And technically I can write well when I want to (please don't judge my grammar and writing here - I'm not at all pedantic or in possession of any need to  always  be correct ;)&nbsp; but its only by living my life and seeing it through the eyes of all my different ages that I'm truly learning  how  to write.&nbsp; I see my world through so many different eyes, my writers eyes, my childs eyes, my angry teenagers eyes...and they all see things so differently (do I sound psychotic yet?)&nbsp; And I have the proverbial neverending story, I think all those who love writing do.&nbsp; That novel that never gets written but winds away in your head, erasing itself in places.&nbsp; I'm not a writer - yet.&nbsp; I may never be.&nbsp; But I have the need to write  something  down regardless. &nbsp; At any rate I don't know what it is yet, and I've eaten a medium cheeseburger meal and half a large bag of doritos.&nbsp; It's high time I move away from my computer!

       urlLink serp &nbsp;firmly put his foot down and told me that I should go shopping and spoil myself before I started the hardcore saving to move out.&nbsp; Last week I tried to go with my workmates but couldn't bring myself to actually buy anything.&nbsp; The only thing I wanted was a wool Donna Karan suit jacket with about 20 darts in the back for $750 reduced from $2000.&nbsp; I couldn't do it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe one day if I ever earn more!&nbsp; Anyway after that I was a bit demoralised - what if I was doomed to only like expensive gear?&nbsp; I consoled myself by buying a lipgloss from  urlLink strawberrynet , a vogue pattern, and two sewing books on couture and high fashion techniques.&nbsp; I paid off my credit card (which wasn't very high but I like having it on $0.00, it makes me feel safe), and my rego.&nbsp; Anyway today we took the Tasmanians to Bridge Rd and we happened across Bennetton where I ran straight to the too-big coat and tried it on again just for luck.&nbsp;  urlLink serp &nbsp;and Racheal and the salesgirl then firmly gave me a push and I bought it!&nbsp; I find it hard to make large purchases on clothing.&nbsp; It was $250 but when I got to the counter it was reduced to $174!&nbsp; It really is a lovely coat, dark red wool, double breasted.&nbsp; Then I found a pink argyle jumper in Jay Jays and and an angora and wool jumper in Portmans for $30! (Cheap for angora and wool!)&nbsp; So I'm a bit over my shopping ph33r.&nbsp; I found a ton of other stuff I wanted but I'd gotten a bit frightened after buying three things in a row so I let it go.&nbsp; There's always more clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also went and got some pro hair stuff the day before, a shine spray and deep treatment - the shine spray is retardedly good, you swipe it through your hair and wham! Instant shiny hair!&nbsp; My kind of product (in that it's instantaneous and doesn't require hours of work).&nbsp;&nbsp; In Myer on Saturday we were rushing to find warm gloves for me before the footy (night game at the MCG) and there was nothing, and I made one purchase out of&nbsp;desperation&nbsp;I would  never  have made in a million years...$50 leather gloves.&nbsp; $50! For fucking gloves!&nbsp; But there was nothing else, we looked in a million shops.&nbsp; At least I dont think I'll ever need another pair of gloves in my lifetime, these are so warm and are black leather so they'll last.&nbsp; While I was in Myer I discovered a perfume that smelled lovely on me (this never happens, most of them smell like shit) only it was $165. $50 for lined leather I can barely get my head around but $165 for flavored water - no.&nbsp; It's L'Or by Torrente, the name and purported Parisian couture house I have never heard of.&nbsp; I'll get it cheap online for sure but it wasn't on  urlLink strawberrynet  so I might chance ebay.&nbsp; With most of my spending money almost spent (I have given myself a weekly allowance which isn't touched), I came home and cleaned up everything ready for the week...and found a little empty sample bottle of Acqua Di Gio by Giorgio Armani which had run out years ago and I had loved it so much but never even considered buying.&nbsp; I made that tiny little bottle last for two years!&nbsp; And yes,  urlLink strawberrynet &nbsp;had that :)&nbsp; I GOT THE BIGARSE BOTTLE.&nbsp; Not for Australian prices of course.&nbsp; It's still $120 in this stupid country and was $74 online in all its duty free glory. &nbsp; Please forgive my shallowness but in my childhood we didn't have doors in my house and ate dubious things from cans and shopped in target and op shops and relied on&nbsp;dated hand-me-downs.&nbsp; I had an expensive (and useless) education and would much rather have traded the so called prestige of my private school and my daggy clothes for a local public school (where I would have done so much better in a world lacking in&nbsp;idiot snobbery)&nbsp;and doors in my house&nbsp;and good food and simple nice clothes which didn't attract the ire of rich kids.&nbsp; As  urlLink serp &nbsp;said, 'go and buy yourself a few nice things - you've never had nice things and you've worked hard and deserve them'.&nbsp;&nbsp; So here I am, spoiled rotten I think for the first time in my life with silly trivia like clothes and perfume.&nbsp; I still dont understand how people (not just girls!) can turn this stuff into their whole lives and use it as some kind of personality transplant - I probably never will.&nbsp; But I can't tell you how nice it is to have a lovely warm coat bought for no other purpose than its warm and looks nice.&nbsp; I can't begin to express the happiness I feel at being able to buy that damn bottle of perfume after years of it not even being a consideration.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to that moment where I take the lid off and smell it for the first time.

      I survived my first week hurray!&nbsp; I'm really happy there too which I never dreamed of.&nbsp; The company is in such a growth stage too so that there's heaps of room to move - skys the limit!&nbsp; Uni already feels like a billion miles away and I finally feel like I'm growing and moving again.&nbsp; That being said, I also never dreamed that there would be a job that my degree was  perfect  for.&nbsp; Everyone gets the 'what if my degree is worthless fear' no matter where or who they are and I got it for a bit too - but it is only fear.&nbsp; And now I'm really  using  everything I learned, from the web development stuff, to the branding and usability theory.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm so glad now that I went for it - at the time it was the only thing I wanted to do in the whole world and I've finally remembered why.&nbsp; Sometimes we just have to go full circle hey!&nbsp; My manager told me that I have gone in with guns blazing and I really have!&nbsp; And all the managers are all 'wow you can do that?' which feels pretty good.&nbsp;&nbsp; I make a point of doing everything really  well .&nbsp; It's one thing to get top marks in uni but quite another to do your tasks well in a job.&nbsp; There's no satisfying HD at the end, just the knowledge that you're keeping the ship moving.&nbsp; Most people there are quite introverted and have business degrees so I'm somewhat of new energy into the mix.&nbsp; It was the same at uni though, the multimedia students were always in a vastly different world to the more traditional schools.&nbsp;&nbsp; And now I'm really really making&nbsp;what I learned&nbsp;and what I have work for me!&nbsp; I suppose this is normal but it feels pretty good.&nbsp; There's no judgements too - everyone at work has come from all over the place so no one sits in judgement over anyone else or what they've done which is a breath of fresh air.&nbsp; They're all pretty open and intelligent though so that probably has tons to do with it.&nbsp; I have learned that judgement and snobbery&nbsp;comes from lack of knowledge or experience which is fine, sometimes you just dont have enough information  not  to judge but when you hold stubbornly onto your judgements just because it's  all you have  then that's sad.&nbsp; I'm pontificating now but I'm thinking of all those people at MLC who questioned my way of doing things because it wasn't the best or the norm - but neither of those ways have ever worked for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think when you hit a wall or start succeeding, either, you really begin to think about what gets you there.&nbsp; In this case, I got my here.&nbsp; Not where I came from or who my parents are who how much money my family has - none of those things have ever helped me.&nbsp; I've done it myself, my way, and I really feel like I'm only just beginning to move!

      Funnily enough  urlLink serp  I had a similar experience today.  I was walking to work from the top of Lonsdale and passed this little door inset into a building with the graffiti 'Rent! 25th!"  My initial thought was 'what strange graffiti' until I realised it was the stage door to a theatre.  You know in the movies how when characters have a realisation they use this cool whooshing tunnel zoom on them so it looks like everything is coming to them at once?  It was like that, but not so  slow .  Suddenly I was eight years old, waiting at that stage door with my father for Tina Arena to come out.  We'd been to see some musical called Dynamite! and Dad had bought me a program and took me to the stage door afterward for the cast to sign.  The memory was physically like being winded and I think I even cried out "Oh!"  Time felt like it froze and I was locked solidly into that memory.  But I didn't even stop walking.  I sure felt like I did though.  It's not very often I get hit with such a resonant memory.  I had forgotten it since it happened.  I dont really have images as memories, in fact they're the poorest reminders.  It's more like where I was standing, what I was thinking and feeling, how the air felt and smelled.  That safe world with my Dad standing next to me.  For a second I was in that world.  It was so good there :)

      I thought today was going to suck being as how most people I know hate their jobs and how it infringes on their time (my brothers wife being the main culprit), so every day I expect to also start hating my job.  But I dont. (Yet).  The whole infringing on my time part is kind of nullified by the fact that I wouldn't be doing anything anyway aside from pointless tasks that take on monumental importance in the face of nothing to do.  I'd much rather do pointless tasks and get paid to do it.  Secondly, my job is quite interesting.  I am working on a number of different products all of which use different skillsets, and before they go to the public they have to get clearance from ME (hahahahahaha) which is a huge value boost, plus all my workmates are nice people.  Today one of them asked me to go shopping with her sometime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  How good is that!    or /?> or whatever the hell it is you do when you close a tag properly.  After putting it off for a day out of fear, I got Priscilla (love the names Cantonese girls choose for themselves) the database admin to show me how to do it and after that I had to test it.  After some hiccups (user error ;) we got it working hurray!    Anyway I get paid monthly right, and while it sucks it is also good because every month I get a couple of grand!  Today I got my first pay and even though I've only worked 5 days, I got paid for those, as well as two weeks into the future!  It took me a while to get my head around but I get it now and its FABBO.  So I have given my Mum $200 board ($50 a week), paid off my credit card, will pay my rego in the morning and put the rest away!  I had money saved for the rego anyway but that can stay in teh savings.  There's a few things I will buy myself however before I start saving.  These are:  An overlocker (finally!!!!!!!) An iPod (a necessity for tram travel) RAM (goodbye 256mb!) Some new runners (the old ones are getting holes) Bed sheets (I have two, would like 4)  Aren't I a shocker!  I like looking at things to buy, there's tons of stuff that on spur of the moment I would buy but I make lists.  I dont buy it unless I'm 100% sure I wont regret it.  And I never, ever regret any purchase I make.  It's a horrible feeling to feel as though you've wasted your money.  Anyway I have to be careful, I have a tendency to want to rid myself of all my money as soon as I get it (lock it away in savings, pay bills etc) to the point where I have none.  I can't touch my savings money unless I'm under threat of legal action, its a handy mental block :P  Enough crapping on it's Australian Idol time.

      Mum is so cute - she is so stoked I'm working that she's shopping for food and cooking me dinner!  It's so nice to come home and there be dinner!  And she seems to like doing it.  That's the nurse in her I guess, they have to feed tired people!  I stuffed myself disgracefully too :D  Today my workmates informed me of a sale at Nine West so we all went down to it and it was full of nasty pushy people and ugly shoes but guess who picked up a 100% wool top for $39!  It's nice too!  But black :(  I wear so much black now I hate it :(  I can't wait for summer.  There are *no* colours in the shops apart from grey, black and brown.  Black makes me look like I've recently DIED too, I look so grey! (Gray?) Hahaha I just saw one of my students in the crowd shots for Australian idol - I wonder if she gets on?  This was the blonde squeaky ugg booted one who actually wound up being very nice! OMFG AUSTRALIAN IDOL IS GREAT.  The songs these people are singing are UNRECOGNISABLE they are so bad! Okay enough crap from me I am boring!

      I think its funny that I wound up where I did.  I dont know if I mentioned that once upon a time I promised myself that I would become the person telling the designers what to do, and the writers what to write rather than the person doing it.  I had enough of being a grunt.  And here I am.  A 'media support coordinator'.  My job involves telling designers what I need from them and companies what copy they need to provide me.  I get to approve outgoing campaigns, and get trade practices clearance from the legal team.  It's only day 3 but I think I like my job.  My workmates laughed at this and told me to wait two weeks ;D  I like the lack of the general public though!  They also tell me that if there are any processes I think can be improved, that I should tell them.  There is no one looking over my shoulder and everyone is young and energetic.  They're not overly trendy, the offices are very boring and you can tell that the money is being spend where it should.  My workmates talk about movie stars and big brother and going to the gym - which is going to take a bit of getting used to but I will.  I need my mind for my work and talking about normal every day stuff will help relax it.  In the outlook database my job is listed as 'marketing media coordinator' which I like better, but the support part is true - I'm supporting 5 different account managers.  I am the backend (hehe), the person who gets the wheels moving and stuff happening.  And this is what I told myself I wanted all those years ago when I left Sausage Software to go to TAFE.  Now I have it!  Why should it seem so strange that dreams and promises made to oneself actually come true?  Maybe its strange because for so many those promises remain in their heads and not in their actions.  It seemed that way to me once.  Everyone seemed to get where they were going as if by magic, as if it was built into their personality like they were just lucky or something.  Hah.  Lucky?  No.  urlLink Sol  quoted on her website that the 'universe conspires to help the dreamer'.  I'll amend that a bit and say that the 'universe conspires to help the dreamer who acts'.

      This 9-5 biz is going to take some getting used to, fortunately the money is good.  My manager took my team and I to lunch on Friday so we could get to know each other which was good.  That place is like a textbook case on how to make your employees feel valued!  The money is good, even still the *people* are good which is such a huge relief.  One of the product managers was also a Swinburne student!  She went to tafe and then uni like me!  The two IBL students were from vic uni, apparently this has become a regular thing for my workplace, employing IBL students every year (which is great), and my manager did a science degree at latrobe and did honours in stats!  Everyone is quite young, my manager, the eldest is only 31!  All the sales/marketing people are older I think but I'm in TEAM OPERATIONS (one of the executives methods of making us feel valued I think ;).  But its nice to belong to a team.  I'm the second oldest!  I felt sad too  urlLink serp .  I started getting teary!  Back at ya Mr Awesome :D  Edit:  Oh yeah, I got a credit (65) and a distinction (82) for my masters subjects.  More than I deserved and proof that they let you get away with too much at the higher levels.  Although my sister told me that in the exams at RMIT (business school) they let you have a pencil case and other crap on your desk and can go to the bathroom unescorted!!!

      Hah I was expecting so much worse.  I arrived and first up I was given my own cubicle (a low walled one) with computer, phone, and drawers with stationery!  Then I got a rundown of the operations for an hour, then introduced to everyone.  Man it was like my first day at Preshil.  Everyone there is really nice and addicted to lollies!  One girl gave me a mars bar hehehe and another told me where to buy the best hot chocolate lol.  They were really supportive and the manager got me to spend the day just reading up on what they do rather than throw me in the deep end.  PLUS tomorrow is casual clothes day!  Every Friday is!  And I get paid super in addition to my pay!  Okay I know I will have bad days too but it's nice to start on a good note.   Okay now I'm so tired I can't see the monitor properly.  More later!

      Okay this feels exactly like the first day of primary school.  You know you're going to be there a long time, and that the days will be long.  You know that everyone is not necessarily going to like you either.  You know that this will get you somewhere maybe one day but that it's going to take a very long time.  Okay sure I didn't know all this when I started primary school but this is how I would feel knowing what I know now ;D 9-5...man, such a long time!  And then I figured I could save like $30k in two years if I stayed home.  That would be the wise choice.  But when have I ever been wise? ;D

      That's what tomorrow is.  I attempted to go shopping for some stuff to wear down Bridge Road today.  Hah.  I am the worst shopper.  I hate pretty much everything and when I do like something it is never in my size.  I wish I was a few inches taller.  However I did get an essential, a wool (70%) and cashmere (10%) coat for $150!  I found the David Jones supplier ;D  Okay I always suspected they were the supplier because the labelling is identical and today I went in there (Paddington Coat Factory) and found that yes, they are the supplier.  They also saw my leather jacket and recognised it as one of theirs and cleaned it for me!  Thank God for companies with standards :P  Portmans was a nightmare, they've started using some really nice fabric for stuff but the only stuff worth buying (not much) was not in my size.  I got a brown wrap top made out of cotton for $10 though.  But that's all I got.  All the shirts were shithouse and overpriced.  All the shirts I wanted were over $100 (for cotton?!?!?!?!)  Oh God...I walked away from this thick wool tweed Benetton coat for $270 (and it was 30% off day too).  I can't stop thinking about it.  It was so well made and thick.  Like a proper old school winter coat.  I just reminded myself that there will be more coats in my future ;D  And then the line from Spaceballs..."TAKE ONLY WHAT YOU NEED TO SURVIVE!"  Anyway enough silliness, I could have bought more, I budgeted for more but clothes are seriously crap in this country.  I'm sure if I actually went to department stores and paid full price things would be a little better.  Maybe once my financial situation is secure and sorted out I will be willing to pay retail (hah).  But tomorrow ends the old me, and my old life.  Uni student no longer.  No more midday waking up times.  And I suspect the work gets so much harder than uni (people vs assignments).  But I found my degree really helped in the interview process, not because it was impressive or anything, but because I could draw on it for experience and used group situations as examples and due dates as deadline examples.  And while I might be paid less for my lack of experience, what I had done at uni was at least a small example to them that I could cope with pressure and multiple deadlines.  I dont think everyone needs a degree to do fantastically, if you have the focus and drive I think you will go far no matter which road you take.  It's just a nice solid bonus!

      I sure used 'well' a lot in that last post.  I rang up the recruiter as requested after the interview to let her know how it went, she was happy, I was happy etc.  So half an hour later the recruiter calls me back and says the client wants me to have a THIRD interview with them and this time meet the national manager!  Fark man I am exhausted.  I thought today was it and I was so relieved!  At least tomorrow is at midday.  That's something.  Just one more.  It sounds like a bastard of a job, I'm basically going to be a middle man to 2372398 different departments and business clients.  I'll be getting trade practices approval for a bunch of stuff, managing the flow of a billion different project and getting shit done for designers and account managers.  They started asking me how I was at managing people.  I hope I haven't bitten off more than I can chew but dammit I want a career so I'm financially stable so that if my husband ever runs off with the hot blonde secretary I will be able to LOOK AFTER MYSELF.  Okay yeah I don't want to end up like my Mum.  Once I feel like I've achieved that then I can reassess.  But for now that's the goal.

      The interview went really well, I answered all the questions well.  They didn't ask any "what are your strengths' style questions so I couldn't crap on about how good I was :P  It was mostly behavioural and past job related which was annoying but I answered well and smiled a lot and thanked them a couple of times for seeing me.  They were also really really nice which always boosts my confidence. So there you have it, first interview.  I think I have a 50/50 chance of getting it, they're interviewing 3 other people this week so if they're more experienced and better than me I wont get it.  If I was the best I will.  I know it's not personal, they're just ticking boxes so I'll try and remember that if I don't get it!  But I'm suspicious because I felt I went well...last time I felt I went well I got a fucking CREDIT.

      It's ridiculous.  This job interview is for ME but I am severely putting off doing my company research and interview practice because I'm so lazy!  Gah so annoying.  I'm so scared of fucking it up that I'm hiding and not trying.  Typical typical.  I'll get over it in a few.  It's always so much harder when things aren't guaranteed ;D  So much more rewarding too if you succeed.

       urlLink This  was a great article about a heroin addicted kid and his thoughts on the problem.  I drew the same conclusions as him a while ago from my own contact with drug addicts, watching my brothers friends spiral downward, a couple die, and friends of my own former friends end up the same way.  Robert the junkie once explained naltrexone, the so called wonder drug.  He was one of the first people to try it, his parents paid $14,000 for it.  Back then they didn't sedate them.  They paralysed them then injected them with this drug that acts as a blocker to heroin.  He told me he was paralysed but conscious for 24 hours and the drug made his whole body feel like it was burning, like he had fire in his veins.  He said the only thing that kept him from going insane was the thought of getting his next hit.  His parents were so disappointed and he told me "I could have told them it wouldn't work". The thing with detox is, fine, you go in, you thrash around for a while and come out detoxed - but weak.  Any smoker knows that in the first three months of quitting, if the opportunity presents itself that it's near impossible to refuse.  It must be so much worse for a junkie, especially how it's generally a lifestyle.  What happens when things get hard?  You've spent so long coping on this drug that you don't know any other way.  And it's still there, and available, along with all your junkie friends.  Nice and safe.  So I agree with Danny.  They need to detox in the country, for a YEAR, where smack is not available.  Sometimes I have this grouse Lord of the Flies daydream where they get like 50 hardcore smack addicts and leave them in Central Australia with supplies but no means of escape and they all withdraw together...okay that's just cruel but its such an interesting daydream.

      The recruiter rang me back about half an hour after 'forwarding my details' asking if I could have an interview with the client on Monday morning!  That's pretty impressive.  I'm being interviewed by 6 people, one is the national manager. The recruiter gave me a rundown of her personality, what to wear etc etc which was really helpful.  She told me to be myself and not be anyone else and also to wear a suit.  This confused me because I had worn a suit to her interview!  I thought maybe it was because my suit was shitty so I went to DFO today to check out the Table Eight outlet (they import Italian gear) but the wool stuff was ugmo and Witchery, Cue, and all the other suity places were shitty. After 2 hours I came to the conclusion that the recruiter was just reading off some kind of spiel because she told me not to discuss salary as well.  In fact she went over the all the basics you need to remember for an interview.  So I'll stick with my suit for now and learn how to make one in the meantime so that the next one will be a wool/cashmere number made to measure my figure.  Trying on suits reminds me of how very short I am because of the jackets come halfway down my thigh.  So fuck it, I have Givenchy AND Donna Karan patterns, I may as well use them.  (When I figure out fitting a bit better).  I keep thinking about all the things I would do if I got the job.  I have to prepare myself for NOT getting it also.  I dont usually put everything on hold for jobs but now that I've got through interview one I really am and not doing ANYTHING until I find out.  That's so bad, I should just keep applying anyway but dammit I want to know because I'm in with a chance.  The good thing is, this interview will only be around half an hour apparently, not an hour and a half (including testing) like the last one.  I've also been carefully constructing my work persona, Katherine, for the purposes of job hunting and working.  I'm one of those people who aren't so good with their boundaries so if I create this other me, this grounded, professional person, it leaves me free to swear and dance around when I'm not at work.  Katherine is still me, but just a side of me that is only used when necessary (ie working).  As soon as the recruiter called me Katherine, WHAM, I went into super professional mode.  It seems to work well.  Katherine in all matters business, Katy to my friends and family!  My gmail account which I've been using only for job applications and correspondance starts with kath.miller (a nice hybrid). Okay blah blah blah I am crapping on now because I really have nothing to say other than it feels like my life has STOPPED while waiting for this second interview!

      (This was printed in The Age yesterday and written by my brother - he's always writing letters and getting them printed in that newspaper but I particularly liked this one and thought I'd paste it here)   $100 million: a battler's perspective   According to Michelle Grattan (Opinion, 23/6), as much as $100 million is being spent on the Government's political advertising. Because such baffling numbers are commonplace in the lofty realms of politics, some perspective may be helpful:  Based on an average annual income of $50,000, advertising equates to more than 8000 years of individual tax contributions. Put another way: at least 200 Australian taxpayers spent their entire working lives funding this latest exercise in political propaganda. If we were to confine ourselves to the subject of health care, this same sum could have provided university education for more than 400 new doctors or some 1500 nurses.

      The interview went well, I was a little quiet I think and they didn't test me on maths after I spent all night with serp relearning my fractions and whatnot.  They tested me on MS Office, Excel, and Powerpoint.  Version 97.  I got 95%, 81%, and 83% respectively, and got 90 wpm gross on the typing test, and 84 wpm net with an error rate of 1%.  They were impressed (hooray I would be a tops secretary).  Anyway the interview wasn't what I expected, mainly questions on my work history and behavioural questioning based on that.  I gave myself 6.5/10 for being a bit quiet (half asleep).  She told me that she was interviewing 3 people for the position, and that she would send on two to be interviewed by the client, and said to call her back the next afternoon to see if I would be one of those two.  I called at 2pm and left a message.  Busy.  I called at 2.30pm.  In a meeting.  I called at 3.  Busy.  I called at 3.30.  In a meeting.  I called at 4 and left another message.  She finally called me back at 4.30pm and said she had received my many messages and had been in back to back interviews and could not possibly have called me back.  I think she was annoyed - but surely an email or something from her telling me this could have avoided that annoyance.  At any rate she told me that she had 'forwarded my details to the client' and that she would contact me on Monday or Tuesday next week and that I didn't need to contact her unless I hadn't heard anything by Wednesday. I thanked her profusely and got off the phone.  Then I told everyone and they said 'what does that mean?' Then I totally freaked out - what does that mean?!  But I spoke to my brother and he said it means that my details have been forwarded to the client which means I am one of the two people she has passed onto them!  I guess she can't say that I will be interviewed by the client because no times have been set and the client might HAAATE my details and just go with the other person.  But at least I made it through the first interview hey!

      I had the worst day ever and got yelled at by the shitty bitch manager but stuck up for myself and got another manager to back me up then the nice manager wrote a work schedule for everyone involved which was immensely helpful then bitch manager went and yelled at her and came to me and said I had to see her after lunch (to get yelled at some more).  She is a nutjob.  After lunch her smile was too bright and she wanted to 'clean the slate'.  Whatever bitch.  I spent the morning holding in tears and the afternoon shaking with anger.  This morning I wanted to quit and go to bed, this afternoon I felt like I'd conquered and was really proud of myself and finally feel like I've gotten somewhere with work.  Which is great because I started the day in a haze of PMS depression.  Nice managers friend (another manager) told me that bitch manager is a bitch...actually everyone in the office told me that she was a bitch and recounted all their stories of her.  How she ever got to where she did with that attitude is beyond me, but she is very assertive and dresses expensively which looks good to clients.  I'll tell my own manager about it (he is quiet and not very assertive ;) tomorrow when I've slept through it.  It's funny though, I feel empowered by this.  Unlike last week when that silly little journalist twit was rude.  I guess you get used to it.  This is life.  It's not like being a little kid with no right of reply.  People are going to be nasty and if you hide from them it will only make it hurt more when they get to you.  Take it from an A+ hider :P   Anyway whatever I feel quite chipper despite the exhaustion - I was so emotionally destroyed today that I didn't drink ANY caffeine.  By the end of the day the sweat was pouring off me and when I took my fuzzy wool + angora jumper off, much of it had collected under my arms which was particularly disgusting (and fascinating ;)

      Weekend was okay, lots of disorganisation on my part, felt seedy and irritable because I need space and have none with my Mum at home.   Still it reinforced why I have to go.  I'm ringing the ATO tomorrow so I can get the details of my last tax lodgement (1998, I dont know how I misplaced it, I keep EVERYTHING in that department) so then I can do my e-tax because it takes two weeks.  If it takes two weeks, and comes out at the amount e-tax says it should then I will have enough combined with my savings thus far to get the hell out of here and be able to pay connection fees for various utilities, rent + bond, some cooking gear and food.  Looking forward to buying those hefty $9 bags of rice from the Asian supermarkets.  Most of my family thinks I am crazy.  For living alone that is.  I get comments like "Oh I could never do that".  I don't see what's so bad about it.  As a wise  urlLink Cat  said last week, that's what the Internet and telephones are for.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not anti social.  I like hanging out with people.  But I crave my alone time.  I like just sitting around by myself doing nothing and having nothing to answer for.   I suppose this is very selfish and that feels good.  I think it's okay to be selfish if it's at no ones expense.  And Mum will certainly benefit from the drop in electricity and two rooms freed up.    I will also make a point of removing *all* of my stuff.  Unlike my siblings.  Okay it's not like I have a whole lot of stuff anyway but that's not the point.  I will be exacting a sweet sort of revenge on my brother bitchface wife by pointedly removing everything I own and cleaning up after myself.  If the place I move into doesn't have a walk in wardrobe, I will leave my camping gear in the shed and throw out anything I can't fit neatly into my place.  I'm not having a go at anyone who stores stuff at their parents houses.  Read PARENTS.  Not boyfriends parents :P  I'm just having a go at bitchface whose stuff is still here.  But whatever, it's not worth wasting the energy on unless I'm going to benefit from it.  Which I am.  I will benefit by leaving Mums house clean and tidy and having a tidy place of my own (except midweek when I cbf).  It's nice to feel angry instead of depressed.  It occurred to me as I fell asleep last night that how I've been feeling is exactly how I felt when I started Tafe.  And Uni.  The whole "what if this isn't what I want to do" feeling.  But unless I can come up with a proper alternative I refuse to jump around and quit things.  I  knew  Masters wasn't what I wanted (yet), but as long as it is only a what if, I think I'll be okay.  Starting anything new is always met with a variety of emotions, fear, uncertainty, depression (that you're not really far along ;) boredom - even anger.   As serps Dad said last night - finishing uni is just the starting line.  I told him maybe one day I would like to do medicine and he outright told me not to!  He said you can go far in any job and earn a lot of money so long as you are excellent with dealing with people.  He said there are people in medicine who earn nothing and get nowhere because they simply don't have the communication skills.  That made me feel better.  I do like my job - I just have no certainty for where I'm going and does that really matter anyway?  Even if I spend 5 years there on the same wage and never get promoted, I will still have saved a lot of money and can simply look for another job, or start a business.  The trick, serps Dad said, is to know your stuff better than anyone else in the organisation, so that no one can do my job but me.  That's one challenge I can definitely rise to! :)

      ...is the book I'm currently reading courtesy of my workmates science fiction collection.  He is introducing me to the wonderful world of Robert Heinlein.  I read Methuselahs Children a couple of weeks ago, reread Neuromancer (still don't like it although the ending is quite good), but I am liking this one the best. Nothing like plainly written adventure SF.  Yeah yeah I'm cheese machine.  I slept on last nights and events and eh, I'm over it and don't really give a shit today.  It's so easy (especially for me) to get caught up in the moment!  Hacinto the Peruvian cleaner came in early today and I recounted numbers to him and he patted me on the shoulder and said "bien, bien" which was ace.  I had to get this software called Visual Source Safe installed today to edit one of the websites (version control stuff) and my workmate Chen installed it for me.  Chen is always nice and really funny and today I found out he studied Civil Engineering in China, then came out here and did it as a Masters at Melb Uni and was halfway through his PhD on earthquakes and engineering before he got this job.  He said he didn't finish also because his supervisor was 'weird'.  I told him I sympathised! Today is good, I'm very sleepy but I got given a ton of interesting work to do and projects to develop to make our team run better so I'm happy.  I think despite the grey officeyness, I'm pretty lucky to have a job I dont hate.  I hated all the others.  So at least I'm moving along! :)  It's nice having a lot to do.  I get a bit depressed when there's not a lot to do because I feel a bit useless.   So I'm exhausted, but it's Friday so it doesn't really matter and at least on Monday I have several large projects to help me forget its Monday ;)

      I don't understand people at the best of times.  But most definitely when they're mean.  Okay yes, I have one of those personalities you either love or hate.  My demeanour can come off as idiotic or fake to those who don't know what makes them happy.  At any rate, I love Spanish class.  I have never been in an environment where I am truly  loving  what I am doing but I love learning a language, and such a passionate one too.  So we all know what I get like.  The happier I get, the more relaxed, cheerful and possibly noisier I get.  Most people manage to get used to me after a while, hell, some even like me.  I wish I could push it all down and sit there with a blank face and repeat the teacher in monotone.  But it makes me so happy to be doing this, how can I not express it? Okay yeah getting to the very small point.  Tonight the teacher asked what page something was on, and I was looking at the wrong page and I called out the number (treinta y ocho, 38).  Anyway it was the wrong page, and then I said to serp "oh was I wrong?" and this girl said loudly and viciously "YES!"  It was the kind of yes that wasn't really yes but more like "SHUTUP, I HATE YOU" kind of yes.  I dont like her very much anyway, she always looks unhappy and has a pursed mouth.  She has a perfect blonde career woman bob which looks right for a forty year old but she is around my age.  Her lips are thin and her face blank.  She's a journalist for The Age.  I wanted to be a journalist once. Any residual dreams I had were erased by this girl because not only does she have a face like a sour anus, but she never ever looks happy.  I dont think I would want to be a journalist if I wound up like her.  Anyway, shit, talk about transported straight back to high school.  I swallowed down some tears, and gave up writing what the teacher was saying.  Just like old times hey.  Just give up because someone was mean.  Fortunately it is not old times.  A few seconds (years?) passed and I thought  no  , I am not going to feel bad for having a go and being me.   I've spent too long lamenting being me and while I'm a little bit off applauding who I am, there was no way in hell I was going to go through all that again.  Plus I am  good  at this.  The guy next to me asked me if I already knew Spanish before I came to the class (that actually made me feel embarassed so I told him I did French in high school and it was similar - which is true).  So then I thought, hey, there is nothing more annoying than a happy somewhat goofy person who is NOT stupid and generally gets it right.  Cos while I was looking at the wrong page, I said the number perfectly.  And afterwards we turned to that page anyway.  So after I got over the initial teary stage, which was followed by a short revenge stage, I reached a new one.  It was the "fuck you I am going to be better than you and shit all over you" stage.  And I was.  (Not that it was hard, she is crap). She seemed to get quieter and quieter after that, I think because I said and did nothing, and let her own actions speak for themselves.  She left very quickly afterward.   But for all my justification, for all that I know I can do this and well despite the uptight, unhappy majority it still hurts.  I don't know if it's just because I'm sensitive, or because it dredges up past classrooms.  I honestly don't understand it.  Maybe she thinks I'm stupid.  Fine.  But if I thought someone was inherently stupid I wouldn't bother trying to show it to them.  There'd be no point because they'd be too stupid to get it.  Jealous then?  It would reflect worse on you than the person you're inflicting it on.  What was it about me that got her so boiled up inside she had to blurt that out so loud?  Why is she so angry for no reason? And if she wasn't a print journalist with a middle aged tv anchors haircut would I even be upset?  What if she was a junkie?  Why does this upset me so much?  Maybe because I dont  want  to make anyone so angry they have to outburst like that.  But I learned long ago that unless it is through direct action, then you can't really curb who you are, and be all things to all people.  Why do people find enthusiasm so offensive?  What is so wrong with this world that people are suspicious of anything positive?  How did it come to be that cynicism is mistaken for intelligence and even lauded?  My last couple of classes I have left on such a high.  Finally something I am really good at and am very happy doing!  But tonight I feel so low.  People don't know what they do.  People live blind in their strange, dark worlds.  They remain so swept up in their immediate emotions that they can't see beyond the tiny little puddle they live in.  But, I try to find a lesson in everything (so I too don't become cynical or insane).  Maybe for all I've been thinking a chosen career or calling is everything, maybe it's not.  Because I thought a broadsheet journalist was a pretty impressive thing to be.  And now I think it's nothing.  It means absolutely nothing if the person wearing that hat can be so bitter.  It's not the title, where you got it, or what your daddy does that makes you impressive.  It's not your bank balance or your clothes.   I will never be impressed by any of these things again.  I understand that others are, and I can use that to my advantage, but I will never truly see it myself.  I wonder how that girl feeling right now?  I don't think its very good.  Or perhaps she feels triumphant.  Until the next time her anger boils over and she has to do something about it all over again.

      Today was another day plagued with stomach pain.  I nearly collapsed on the tram home.  I'm blaming the teapot I gave my brother years ago which he left here.  I took it to work and started using it on Monday without cleaning it.  On Monday I got hit with this insane pain and then I cleaned it.  Maybe not good enough.  I hardly used it yesterday and was fine.  Today I drank four cups of tea (two black, two peppermint) fairly quickly and an hour later the pain came on.  Might also be the fibre I dumped on my breakfast cereal in a fit of healthiness.  Why did I do that? I already eat fruit!  I also put LSA (crushed linseeds, sunflower seeds, and almonds) on there too although I've used that fairly consistently without issue.  So tomorrow I will have a normal breakfast, and will also stay away from the teapot.  The worst part is that it would have been a really good, interesting day had the pain not been there.  I slept off whatever it was bugging me yesterday and woke up really pumped.  By late afternoon I wanted to curl into a little ball and be unconscious.  I was craving the general anaesthetic from a couple of years back...that part where they put the mask on you and get you to count to ten and stick the needle into your IV.  I counted with a big fat grin on my face and remembered thinking 'WOOHOO!' as that big rush of black engulfed me (literally like a huge wave).  I would kill for that right now.  An anaesthetic that wears off at 6.55am tomorrow and leaves me feeling fine.

      Walking down my street tonight, I was struck with a metaphorical slap in the face as I discovered the big old gum tree across the road from my house had been cut down.  I stopped and recoiled as if physically struck and in that moment I had a split second decision to make.  Do I lament the disappearance of the tree that has stood there all my life or do I understand that things change?  I chose the latter and kept walking.  It's just a tree and in the end means nothing.  Things change.  If they didn't, the world would suck.  Nothing would be new and we would never grow.  I've never had much problem coping with change.  My sister is another story, she creates an insular world for herself and consequently falls to pieces in a variety of ways when things dont go as she envisioned them.  I am the opposite and deal with change far too easily.  I have no qualms picking up and changing my life at any given time.  If things don't work as I expect them to, I change the way I work to make them operate better.  So today after that mopey little post I went to a farewell lunch for a man I've never met.  I got to know my workmates better.  And I realised what benefit there was in working there.  Support.  I remembered back to my Telstra days when I talked about the ex and how their support was instrumental in me gathering the strength to leave him.    And today when I was talking and I found my workmates listening, I found some strength again.  Not to leave anyone!  But the kind that will offer help where it can.  And sometimes I'm not going to like my job, or working at all.  I dont feel as if I fit in with the types of people there, I'm the only media person they've hired.  Everyone there is dedicated to their words and sales and programming strings while I'm dedicated to my images and sounds and their spoken word.   But I like them and they like me, and there is no better way to learn about yourself than to hang around people vastly different to you. Things will change.  This I know.  Occasionally I forget.  Things will change whether you like it or not, gum trees will be cut down and childhood memories erased.  It doesn't matter.  Stand there with your head firmly turned towards the past and I can promise you no future.  Unfortunately for me my head is very much fixed on the present which I find deeply frustrating but for the moment is necessary.  But someone, please shake me when it's no longer necessary?  Shake me when I am turning grey and uncurious (is that a word) like my office.  I want to know the monster not become it.  Which reminds me.  I have just discovered the BLATANT marketing towards people who are bored in their work (which I am on and off).  Today I saw an ad with a woman slumped at her grey desk wearing a grey suit and it said BORING.  And underneath it had some chocolate that said EXCITING.  Or something like that.  The worst part is I am sure that people fall so far down the rabbit hole that they will truly believe chocolate will be enough to satisfy their permanent boredom (okay chocolate is pretty rad but is not a rut cure!).  And when they get dissatisfied again they will buy more chocolate again!  Brilliant!  But disgraceful!  That's a very simplified perspective but it's a blog not an essay.  I thoroughly enjoy my freedom to use poor grammar, and dubious words on here.   I don't like this carrot and stick life people seem to live.  I wan't the whole shebang.  I want the fucking carrot without having to chase the stick.  I dont want a $120 top that will make me feel better for the evening I wear it.  I want to own nothing and have the freedom to do everything.

      Blogging from work because I cannot take my mind off the possibilities running through my mind.  The more I discover what I  don't  want to do, the closer I become to finding what it is I do want.  In meetings, on the phone, I am always thinking about what I could be doing.  This office environment is stifling.  It is grey, and grey and grey and grey.  More and more I realise that I need colours.  I need to create.  I need to make things work and make them look beautiful.  I need a big messy studio that perfect things come out of.  I need to share my creations with everyone, I need to push a message.  I am not functional or practical despite having trained myself to be.  I need other messy creatives (not pretend ones) like me to work with and come up with brilliant big ideas to push our messages.  I need to find a way to stop those children being paid 30c an hour for making clothes without them being put out of work.  I need to give them the same work and pay them  more .  If I had the money I would rent a studio and get to work.  I could do that now you say, but believe me when I say that creativity is hard to find when you're worrying about your next meal or how you're going to pay for your equipment when bills are staring you in the face.  The proverbial starving artist I am not.  I'm not even an artist, I'm just creative and I need to be.  I just want peace of mind.  I dont want to create work for other peoples minds.  I want to create in the way I like, creativity for myself and I want it to work and be successful in its own right.  Isn't this every creatives dream?  Integrity in their work?  It's just a dream for now.  I have no money, no inheritance, other than what I make for myself.  And working from the ground up presents such an attractive challenge! My dreams of living and working in an artists coop might be gone by next week anyway  We all know what I'm like :)   But in the immortal words of whoever wrote Adrian Mole "You have to learn the rules before you can break them".  I've learned the hard way what happens to people who jump from one thing to another without finishing them.  I will finish everything I start and learn from all of those things.  Masters was my big mistake and I've learned from it and while I didn't finish it, I didn't just give up and fail because I wasn't going to finish anyway.  I stuck it out and got my marks so I'm not a total dropout.   I know what my lesson from this place is, and that is discipline - something I lack, and what every creative person needs.  And I refuse to let my dreams go unfulfilled (whatever they may be) and just default back to having children and bringing up the way I should have been.  That  doesn't work .  And yeah, I want to be a millionaire.  When I'm a millionaire I will buy rainforests to stop them being chopped down, and buy those clothing factories so those who want to make their Nikes have to go through me.  And my workers union.

      Today was shitty.  I'm rapidly concluding that Mondays are going to be shitty because I stay up late on Friday and Saturday nights and then can't sleep on Sunday night.  Also I ate pizza two nights in a row and had three beers on Saturday night.  Which all amounted to a shitty, shitty, case of heartburn which is still going.  Couple with exhaustion, well you get the idea.  More and more though am I realising how important it is for me to exercise.  When I was running and had to get up early, sure I'd still be tired but coping was piss easy.  I dont know how that works.  All I know is that you're tired but it doesn't matter.  Your muscles carry you I guess.  Unfortunately right now I have none and I have to do something about it but my life appears to be lying around in varying fragments right now.  I have my work fragment.  My home that is not my space fragment.  My weekend where I want to play fragment.  Consolidating all that and exercising is going to be difficult.  But I want to be able to do what I need to without barrier, or difficulty.  And that requires work.  It requires standing up and going outside when I want to be sitting down.  And not just doing it once and then patting myself on the back for it and expecting it all to work by itself from that point.  Hah.  I always do that.   I was thinking on the way home in my exhausted and pain induced state, how nice it would be to have a housewife.  Someone to iron your clothes and have dinner for you when you got home.  Someone who made sure you didn't have to do shit other than get up and leave in the morning because it's all done for you.  That would be ace.  I feel a bit sorry for men because that's gone now.  Although my brothers wife cooks and takes his shirts to the cleaner for him and makes his lunch.  She's probably that sort of person, but I find it bad enough having to do this shit for myself - how does she find the time to do it for both!  Enough whiny babbling, for the shittiness I feel I'm not grumpy.  I just wish my clothes would wash and iron themselves and that everything would be right for tomorrow.   It would be fine if I felt fine but I dont.  I'm going to get up in the morning and throw on what I can find and hope it will be okay.  Ugh.

      Today after some deliberation and lively arguments with the bigpond lusers on irc, I bought this lovely little  urlLink digital camera .  I started looking last night and found that this suited my needs and was in my price range.  A few people told me that "Canon were the best".  This kind of thing always sets off alarm bells in my head and I am suspicious of people who operate on reputation alone when making purchases.  Further queries to their reasoning were met with answers like "because they make their own lenses", and "the press pit at the car racing all use Canons".  For high quality sports photography they may be.  I wanted good rich colour over lens quality (its a home user digicam, lens quality is much of a muchness) and I compared the sample photos between the Kodak, Sony, and Canon (in the price range).  Kodak won so I went to Dick Smith armed with the knowledge they had run out of a model they had advertised.  (I'm sure there are better places I could have gone, but my price benchmark was digitalcameras.com.au and was up for a challenge).  After pointing out to them that they had an advertised model which they were out of stock, and none of the required text stating "limited stock" (this is required by the trade practices act - go work I totally learned something!) they knocked it down to $475 ($25 off).  W00t.  I later found out I could have got it down more but the fact that I even *argued* is a huge boost for me.  I could have gone further on the illegality of that but I was on a high just from taking that first step (it's a big thing for me ;) Anyway, here is a  urlLink photo  of my friend the goat, and  urlLink another  taken by the new cam.  They're a bit overexposed because the light was so bright and brilliant today - but I prefer my photos that way and they demonstrate the insane saturation this camera does.  These were taken in auto mode.  Perfect for taking random photos of stuff - and setting up a photo blog when I get the chance!!  And here's  urlLink some sheep  because Smegs told me the goat was too contrasty :P  (And then he told me that this photo 'didn't work' although it's just me fooling around ;)
