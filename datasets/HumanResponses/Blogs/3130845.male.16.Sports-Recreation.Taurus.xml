      I have a hunch that the Channel 4 Producers well will axe big brother on it's obvious craptitude. People only watched it for the Sex... It was supposed to be a social study, but now it's a sick programme for people who really should be out enjoying themselves - preferably seeing Simon Bowman *g*  But we all can't be perfectionists can we ?  I'm not really looking forward to going out to Cornwall. I know what this weekend will end up as, a glutton-fest. I really don't like the way it's heading. How can I say, I'll stick to my chicken breast please - which a minimum of oil. Alternatively, I could snack out at a Service Station. however, I just know that I'll end up betraying everything that I've worked for physically.  Tomorrow Night/Sundya Morning, I'll post about my new fattened weight.    Current Mood : Awaiting the forcefeeding, like a lamb before the slaughter. *cries out loud*

       urlLink This  is weird. I was flicking through MaE and Linn's site and I came across the photo, it's of Simon Bowman allright, but why is Paul Monaghan Javert?   Simon never played on the tour and Paul only covered Javert, this leads me to think only two things. Peter Correy (Javert alongside Simon Bowman in 2000) was absent for the Photoshoot, highly weird or perhaps Paul Monaghan was an interim Javert. Weird :ยง  I'm going to try and see Les Mis on Saturday depending on what time we get back from Cornwall! I've got to  try and be back before 6:45, so I can get down to the Queens.

It'll be a void filled within the next two weeks.  Derren Brown is going to the Palace from next Monday? Should I go or not. I might go actually. I find the man a total con-artist, but I'll go to the palace atleast to scatter my roses and look back at fond memories. At least, we'll have the memories.  I'm highly contimplating going to see Phantom sometime soon, before Oliver Thornton goes across. I'm also resolved to get my grubby little paws on the New London Cast Recording of Anything Goes. A recording that I really want.  I'd like for Wicked to come across and so I can see it, Kirtin Chenoworth need not transfer *evil smile*. I'm off to watch the last 9 minutes of Big Brother *stands up* I'm probably the only person watching it tonight. *takes seat and awaits applaud*  I like my new blog...

      Simon's Back, and I've got a new blog. Saw Les Mis tonight and here's my review. Ahh the nostalgia.   Simon Bowman  (Valjean): It was a Jelly Baby moment. I had goosepimples since I saw his name on the cast board. Inside I yelped "Whooooo" (I could have done this out loud). I was practically pinching myself all throughout the prologue, was I dreaming? No, I wasn't. Simon was very really good, although undeniably rusty. Unfortunately his First Act did let him down some what, during "What have I done?" he delivered a great portion off stage, a shame. However he had the passion. Also, great portions of his performance were delivered orally rather than sung. He remindeed me more of P&eacute;r&eacute;e Madeline. He played well alongside Jean McGlynn, who was covering for Joanna. Firstly, he showed genuine remorse for vhis shortsightedness and I could really feel the sweeping change happening within the man. Simon wasn't up to speed on the "Who Am I" introduction he delivered "You say this man... orse" and further along "This innocent who wears my  place  he goes to judgement in my place". However, the rest of the act carried on smoothly. He delivered a brilliant "Come to Me" with Jean and worked very well with Sean. His Second Act, however, was simply sensational - it really was the stuff I remembered. His "Bring Him Home" was a million times better than Jeff Leyton's. Who, I never unfortunately got to see in full health. Simon reallly came together during the Finale, I got the sense that he genuinely moved by his death. Even though his funniest line was delivered here. "...Cosette weep to know I'd died", awww so funny. I'll be seeing Simon next weekend *g* YIPPEE.   Michael McCarthy  (Javert): Yes, once again a sensational performance. I really don't know what to say about him, other than  - he is Perfection.   Jean McGlynn  (Fantine u/s): Jean's Fantine is miles away from her Factory Girl, if I had not known that Jean played the Factory girl, I would have never guessed that they were the same people. I actually had a premenition that Jean would be on tonight. She was *g*. I found her Fantiune to be very strong and she sang "I dreamed a dream" in a very operatic style, however, I didn't get the sense that she was all there. Her voice was sensational, but there was something slightly off about her style. She died beautifully and she performed well all throughout with Simon and her Finale was passionate. I want to see her again.    Katy Secombe  (Madame Th&eacute;nardier): Katy was brilliant tonight, she worked well with Sean K., I got the impression that she  was  that tireless workhorse who delighted in trashy novels. She  did  treat Little Cosette as though she was the skivvy and really not her concern. She was hillarious as well, making the most of her lines. She delivered a great "Beggar at the Feast".   Sean Kingsley  (Th&eacute;nardier): He was brilliant tonight, in his gruff tone of voice he really did get across how slimy a character Th&eacute;nardier really is. You get the sense that he really is out there just to rook his guests. I did find it slighly annoying that he adopted some of Stephen Tate's nuances. However, he is my favourite current London Th&eacute;nard. He delivered a phenominal "Beggar at the Feast" too.   Sophia Regavelas  (&Eacute;ponine): She was giving me dirty looks. However, putting that aside she was brilliant tonight and she worked well with Jon Lee. However, I was concerned during the bridge song between "Attack on Rue Plumet" and "One Day More" beceause she spent some time talking to the Stage Hand who looked like she was going to lead Sophia off stage. She also seemed to be whispering to Jon as the stage turned around.   Lydia Griffiths  (Cosette) - Cosette you Bitch! Personal opinions aside, she was Fantastic and she really is that little lover who developed from that "lark". A great performance from an excellent performer.   Oliver Thornton  (Enjolras): *leaves to go get a drink*   Jon Lee  (Marius): *returns with drink in hand* Jon was very good tonight, I never ad it in for his Marius. I just feel that actor who hasn't enjoyed their time in Les Mis, *points to Steve Balsamo* should cut their losses. However, Jon has never perfomed under par nor he has given anyone cause for alarm.    Amanda Dainty  (Swinging for Jean): Amanda is what I refer to as a Brummy Girl, she plays her  Factory Girl as though she comes from the Midlands, that's great, it really does add a different perspective to the role. Amanda has seemed to Model her Factory Girl around Jean's, she had it town to a T, even emulating her hairstyle and afflections. I also find it astounding how she is able to slip into the role of Madeline so well, I personally don't like the way Madeline takes such a beating. Amanda is my favourite Ensemble Swing alongside Adeen Ashton.   Vivienne Care  (Madame/Bag Lady): Vivienne has really become a fitting replacement for Laurie, however, I don't feel that her Madame Th&eacute;nardier will be as good or as funny. However, Viv is a great Barricade girl.    Adeen Ashton  (????): Adeen was definately in tonight, however, I didn't see her. Amanda and Sarah Counsell both played the crones, Adeen wasn't Mrs. Posh Diner nor was she in Turning. I hope she's okay. Adeen, however, took the bows with Simon and Amanda *g*  THE SHOW WAS GOOD TONIGHT, HOWEVER, THERE ARE A FEW PROBLEMS THAT NEED TO BE IRONED OUT.

      I feel universally pissed off right now, because of several reasons...  1) I've lost my Gym membership card thingy. My fault 2) I've got a bruise, which'll heart like bloody buggery tomorrow 3) I want a hug, and I'm not having one... 4) Where's my hug?  *perks up* on the other hand, I plan to start a new workout regeime tomorrow. Which I guess is okay, but it should see me left in the UK for the next two months. Though I don't mind, there's nowhere special that I'd like to go anyway, well atleast nowhere that can't wait.  I've also decided to try and not get so angry any more, I have therefore decided to impose a restriction on my seeing Les Mis&eacute;rables. I shall now see shows, as and when they are necissary to see. However, that doesn't prevent me from watching all the forums. *g*  I've also signed up to  urlLink Fark  on acount of it being the best places to pick up funny stories on a day that has been really crappy, like today. On a lighter note, the hot weather has finally cessated.  I'm not in a bad mood anymore :), thank you very much blog.   Current Music : Les Mis&eacute;rables TAC - First Attack

       Simon Bowman  (Jean Valjean): Simon was brilliant, he manages to make each performance as passionate as the last, something I've found all too rare in west end performers. He sang this time with such unfaltering passion and convicrtion - that the audience couldn't help but be sweapt away in the music and his voice. His prologue was very well carried out, and so was his entire performance. I found him to be the only Valjean who I have really found is true to the book. His Bring Him Home was sensational and sung with such vocal prowess that I've come to expect from him. His Finale was heartrendering as he has been one of the few Valjean's I have seen that have broken down in tears - Sean K., Chris Fennessy are only two that come to mind. My only quarm is that he persists in singing Bring Him Home, whilst holding a gun. Other than that a brilliant performance, and I'll be seeing him once/twice more before he leaves. I hope twice. *g*   Michael McCarthy  (Javert): A wonderful performance, yet again. his Javert's suicide was filled with such emotion that I could really indentify with his character. Wonderful. Thanks for the performance.   Joanna Ampil : (Fantine): Joanna has grown on me so very much. She has become one of my favourite Fantine's, because of her beautiful portrayal and also because of her wonderful voice. Last Night, she played Fantine with such beauty that I was moved from her introduction. Wonderful. *g*   Katy Secombe  (Madame Th&eacute;nardier): Katy was brilliant last night. Her performance was outstanding, she worked well with the Little Cosette. In that performance, I was able to perceive her as the nasty woman who spoiled Eponine and loathed Cosette. I had the feeling that she was one of those cast members who, although her first time playing the role, has always been in the role - and that isn't a bad thing. She too has really grown on me.   Stephen Tate  (Th&eacute;nardier): Stephen was brilliant last night, he was comical and he was delivering a couple of his lines to me, but also staring at me during Look Down (because I was munching an apple and not being very discreet about it). He delivered a brilliant Master of the House and his Beggar at the Feast was sensational. Katy and Stephen make two really sensational Th&eacute;nardiers. Wow!   Lauren James  (&Eacute;ponine u/s): Lauren was sensational as &Eacute;ponine, she was sensational, with such a strong and powerful voice and she worked well with Jon Lee. I really had the impression that she was the lovelorn child. Her On My Own was powerful and A Little Fall of Rain was very moving, and very powerful, again. She is my favourite Current London &Eacute;ponine.   Lydia Griffiths  (Cosette): Lydia was brilliant tonight, although, I've made no secret that I dislike Cosette, but I absolutely love Lydia's interpretation, She is sensational. so glad she's staying Three more months.   Jon Lee  (Marius): Jon was very good tonight, he actually is getting better, however, I feel that his presence of being here one year is quite enough. However, I'm perfectly happy to see him return in the future. Great Peformance.   Oliver Thornton  (Enjolras): Tonight was passionless, however, his vocal strength is growing. Though, I'm more uspest that he's ascended to the role of Raoul ( The Phantom of the Opera ), I feel that this is change that won't suit him as a person, however, I don't know. So, I'll go and see him when he opens in September.    Adeen Ashton  (Ensemble): Adeen was brilliant tonight, though her voice seemed a little strained. She was sensational in Turning covering several tracks at once. Brilliant all the same.   Sean Kingsley  (Foreman/Couferyac): Sean is a sensational foreman, I'll be sorry to see him leave the role. He plays the role just right, but he still is a little to posh for my taste. He should be more grittier. His Couferyac however has grown on me immensely, though not as good as Chris Key nor Chris Fennessy.   Jean McGlynn  (Factory Girl/Madeline): She was wonderful tonight, however, I got the impression that she was playing the role as though the Factory Girl was americanised. She also doesn't take a beating, as Madeline, as well as Amanda Dainty does. Oh well.   Sophia Regavelas  (Ensemble): Sophia was great as the field worker and she is the cute nosy girl that I've grown to love in Les Mis&eacute;rables. I hope she gets better soon.    Sophia Regavelas did not play &Eacute;ponine due to her indospition, however, I am assured that she'll be playing &Eacute;ponine today.

      I took the geography test, but I didn't complete it - leaving a huge gaping hole. Basically, I missed out on 30 marks and I'm bloody well pissed off. Though, I shan't be for long.  One more fishy has died, it was Swimmy, I've been inconsolable for five minutes, but when I was told that we'd get Swimmy Too* I perked up no end.  Tomorrow I've got maths, or as I like to call it, the bloody impossible. I'll try but no doubt I'll fall at the first hurdle. In retrospect, I'm glad that I'm doing the intermediate tier - because that would be great to do.  Slly Ann Triplett has taken a nasty fall, poor dear, I hope she gets better because falling during the Curtain Call of AG is hideous.  This lunchtime I did the most fantastic walk ever, I really did enjoy it, I walked down carnaby street and looked in the Kings Close shopping centre - it's my kind of shopping arcade: hip, young and full of good looking women *g*  I then wondered a bit, following my nose, until i found this curious Health Store, it was a practical department store - amazing, I must have spent ages in there. I wasn't keeping track of the time, but I doubt it was more than 10 minutes walk away.    I then found another Italian store, better than Carluccio's but far worse than Camisa & Son. From there I  was walking past some very seedy shops, which desgusted me, however, I found a quaint bookshop which I was considering getting a book for my brother - The History of Punk.   I then was thrilled to find myself walking right past the Apollo Theatre, this meant that I walked from Oxford Circus to the Queens in half the time it would usually take me *beams with self-pride*. The weather today has been absolutely gorgeous and I wish it would stay like this, at last, I hope it's like this for Thursday.   I've got to get my mizzy ticket tomorrow, which I must not procrastonate about. I really hope it'll be as good as it was last thursday.  I've nbeen trying to revise, but I'm failing - however, I know what Pi means - it's a food type - very icky.  *waves* I'll try and post later.

Firstly, I didn't think much of it until tonight - when I found their website. All I have to say is utter luxury *drools*.  There are elementsd of the hotel that I don't remember, but what I do remember is the wonderful swimming pool set in the eaves of the hotel. It was wonderful, especially the way the wall had a wonderfully appoint freize on the wall.  I've decided that Somehow, someway I shall send my parents back to the hotel *stops in his thoughts* even though the price is *drumroll* ยฃ90 a night and I'll want them to be out there for atleast a week.

      I finally got to watch Calendar Girls and I have to say tha the film was excellent. I know that a fair amount of people hated it, but I really did enjoy it.  I found elements of the film profoundly moving and it was yet another British Film well portrayed and without the Hollywood Flaire!  This movie really does remind the viewer what a "shitty disease" cancer is. Overall, the movie was touching and wonderfully hillarious. I'm not one ofr mixing comedy with tragedy - but this worked very well.  Anyways, I've returned from Cornwall and for once not having eaten like a horse, nope, that happened in Devon. I managed to survive on Fruit Salad and Pasta *g*, but tha was ruined by an immensely saturated Salmon pasta dish. But can't be helped.  I'm going out, with my Younger Brother, to go and se Harry Potter 4.

      Today I was perusing the kitchen department at Selfridges and I was very dissapointed by it. I found that it stocked only style and none of the utensils were practical. I've also managed to take advantagee of looking at the bed linin, and I can't find any decent dressing gowns.  I walked into D&G  on Bond Street, and who should I see in the female clothing department? Victoria Beckham, she was the first Star I have ever spotted. So i'm thrilled about that.  I also stopped off at Tiffany&Co and I feel in love with their mens fragrance, it was to die for. Shame it was &pound;50. Ah well.  I have found heaven in the form of Aspery. It's interior design is to go gaga over, and it even has that wonderful parisian caged lift that I absolutely adored.  Enjoyed an absolutely stunning Lentil soup at Patisserie Valerie Soho, amazing value as well.  Carm&eacute;n was a particularly brilliant performance, with very strong orchestrations. The Soprano (Carm&eacute;n) was very strong vocally, but an abismal actress. The Baritone (Jos&eacute;) was terribly miscast and I had no feeling of depth from him. The ENO ensemble were particuarly strong and gave a sensational performance.  The ENO improvements were for the better, with great additions and a stunning roof top terrace, which was closed due to the rain. The performance had 3 (2 offically recognised, 1 unoffical) intervals to allow for the scene changes.  The set design was really uninspired, with the scene changes taking far too long. I felt that squeezing three intervals out of a 3:15 performance was a bit too much. The audience became restless during the third Interval, with people trying to leave [even though the house lights weren't on at full strength].  I'm sleepy now, So I'm going go to bed now.

      There was a report released claiming that there is something along the lines of Ticket Price fixing. Apparently event managers and ticket retailers are in "cahoots", i.e. they are in league.  This isn't such a stupid theory, because Theatres keep their prices high, for example Les Mis&eacute;rables moved to the Queens because it can sell more premium seats and push up the prices. This is because there are no genuine  urlLink "restricted view"  seats.  Who remembers the good old &pound;7.50 at the Palace.

      Channel 4 pullens a publicity stunt and my god hasn't it worked. They send Emma and Michelle back into the house, with booze and they expect everybody to play nice.   Well, there was name calling, hair pulling, bitch-slapping and it was cut off Television. Now, my theory is that none of this happened, and the minute the camera was switched off everyone calmed down.  This morning, I wass kind of pissed off because I took my Business Studies GCSE and it sucked. I was put down to the foundation tier, which in retrospect was a better level for me to be taking. Though I found parts of it somewhat patronising - "What's a PLC?".   I've only got two exams left, Business Studies 2 and History 2. I should be done by next Wednesday and then I go on a ten week holiday. I might find work at JD Sports which boasts a pay package of ยฃ300 a week.  I better take the job while I still am tax exempt.

I have a firm sense of his passion for food and his belief that the British style of cooking hasn't died. Which is Fantastic.

      ookay here's my review. I'm going to cut off because I'm v. sleepy.   Sean Kingsley  (Jean Valjean): He was amazing tonight, he played JVJ with such compassion. Earlier I expressed my doubts about his voice and how it was too gravelly for Valjean, well I don't think it'll be an issue anymore, because he's worked it in to the role. Wonderful. His Bring Him Home was tear jerking and so powerful.   Michael McCarthy  (Javert): Michael was astounding tonight... Can't wait to see his understudy though *pauses* No offence to the greatest Javert who ever walked the earth.    Joanna Ampil  (Fantine): She was 110% tonight, she had such a powerful voice and her voice really did shine during I Dreamed a Dream. Joanna has also put a little Grania Renihan into her voice, a wonderful touch.  I found her performance very convincing and she rocks as Fantine.   Katy Secombe and Stephen Tate  (The Th&eacute;nardiers): Sorry, I have to review these as a pair, because I've got more to write. They were brilliant tonight and Katy shone through during Look Down/ The Robbery. Katy has really improved and I think that Stephen is already in his nich&eacute;. Hope they'll be as good next time.   Gemma Wardle  (&Eacute;ponine): She is what I call a retro &Eacute;ponine, with her flowing curls. She is an older &Eacute;ponine, but I don't hold it against her, she is by far the second best &Eacute;ponine I have seen, second only to Joanna Ampil. She actually maintains that grity gaminish quality around her, and her voice is to die for, though at times I could really picture her in Joanna's shoes and vice versa. She lost her hat during Attack on Rue Plumet, but everything went wrong during that scene - the foliage fell off and Gemma skillfully kicked it away. Her On My Own was chilling to the last, it was haunting and very passionate. She kissed Gary Tushaw (Marius), a very Joanna Touch - lovely.   Gary Tushaw  (Marius): He has got an astounding voice, very beautiful, but boy, isn't he the most annoying Marius ever? He isn't that macho annoying, but more a depressing annoying. I'm sure that he'll improve. I did get the impression that he was a little bit nervous tonight, but that's okay. Nothing wrong with that.   Oliver Thornton  (Enjolras): *flicks through Television Channels*   Lydia Griffiths  (Cosette): She was amazing tonight, quite literally a mirror of her first performance as Cosette that made me sit up and take notice of her.   Martin Scott Warden  (Foreman/Brujon): Oh my god, isn't he the best foreman ever, except for Mike McCarthy. He rocked totally, a throwback to the 2001 cast - yaaaay! His brujon was also the funniest I have ever seen. He worked well with everyone, and I'm only too sorry that he won't be covering Javert.   Matt Harrop  (Grantaire): He is not funny, *cries* Mummy slap him, he's too depressing for me. I found his Grantaire quite lifeless and he doesn't have that charming depth to him that I like about Grantaire oh well.   Nicolas Pintos  (Bishop of Digne/Montparnasse): He was good as the Bishop, but his Montparnasse reminded me of Maralyn Manson, with all the make up.   Siubhan Harrison  (Fctory Girl): A great Factory Girl, a lousy Madeline. She didn't take quite a battering as Madeline. I hope she improves as Madeline, but a great Factory Girl.  Oookay, this was their 5th show, 6th if you count Photoshoot show (this morning) and they've got to find their places. So, I'll see them in around 3 weeks time.

That is not a healthy balance people, you can't expect to be thin by eating huge amounts of fat, carbs or no carbs.  Carbohydrates are essential to daily life and it even helps control your mood.

      During A funny Thing, I got the impression that this is a play full of great comic moments, but a lousy score (shame because Sondhiem has composed some brilliant peices.). The musical director insisted on taking huge gulps, which  were audible throughout the entire theatre.  Since the show is technically not open yet, they can still touch up. The mistakes included Philip Quast's tunic becoming tangled in one of the revolving doors and people mucking up their lines, but covering with excellent comic attitudes.   Caroline Sheen was great, and very strong as was Philip Quast, who was sensational. I personally did enjoy the shoe and it's part of the NTs good strong season.

       urlLink *Jumps for Joy*   The 3NT of Les Mis&eacute;rables is scheduled to begin in Plymouth as does the US Version of Miss Saigon. Interesting that Oliver! is being revived. I'm looking forward too seeing the trio of musicals later on this summer. 10 days to go.  I watched the Rocky Horror Show, please agree with me how great the film is. Speaking of crazy audience participation tpye thingys. Dress Circle could be doing a karaoke of Wicked. Count me in.

      July 4th, July 4th.   Moving on, I can take pleasure in the fact that David Hasselhoff's rehersals aren't going to plan. I knew that an inflatable Pamela Anderson would upstage Becca and Anita-Louise. I shouldn't be so cruel, sorry.   Summer is almost over and soon it'll be winter all over again. *cries* Ah Well, more time for me to get a cold then. This Wednesday, I'm going to have my facial, which should be okay.

      Mary Poppins has confirmed its cast, yaay! and I'm glad to see that Linzi Hately, LMK and some good old Les Mis alumna and alumni there in the cast.  Rehersals officially begin on Monday and the show opens in November, which is great news for me and also Miss Saigon is doing the rounds and I might be enticed  to go and see it.  Yesterday I took the crossing across the channel and I must say that although the crossings were pleasent, the fog wasn't. It kept us hovering outside Portsmouth for a bit, ah well. It was great for the experience, save for the little kids running screaming: "We're gonna die".   I'm still in silent protest at the fact of David Hasselhoff joining the cast of Chicago, but it seems that his pulling power has really pushed the show into booking well into the new year. I'm looking forward to catching the show when he has left.  Tomorrow, I'm going to spend at me leisure, mostly wondering around London and dreaming of stuff that I can't afford. Oh well :)   Current Music : Wicked - Defying Gravity

      Finally got to see our house in France again and it's looking okay, but a 5,000sq Foot house was far too draughty... My fault really for voulenteering to go.  However, yesterday night we had dinner on the North Coast and it was fantastic, although the restaurant was suffering from regular outages, which I guess because a regular feature because the staff carried on regardless.   I've voted that we return to France, across the channel and I'm looking forward to doing so. Because, the Ferry is my preferred mode of transport. Today has been pissing down with rain and the wind has been howling, so I vote that it'll be a bad day today.   Current Music : Overture to Carm&eacute;n

      Next  Week, I get to go to Manchester, so I could get a chance to catch something up there.  Hopefully there'll be something good.   I've also discovered my true calling, to drive people crazy. It's a talent that I only possess, I must only use it for good.   Interesting statistics for you, McDonald's UK spent &pound;1 Mil. in promoting their healthier lifestyle, however considering that their annual advertising budget is &pound;50 Mil, that's only 2% of their resources spent to make people aware of obesity, the other 98% is spent helping to create it. Scary thought.  Final announcement, Claire Moore (Ellen in Miss Saigon), Joanna Ampil (ex Eponine and current Fantine) and Jerome Pradon (ex Marius and Javert) have all agreed to take part in  One Day More  a celebration of Claude Michel and Alain Boublil's work, finally. I wish them good luck and hope that they will enjoy themselves. I might go up and see them on the Friday concert that they perform.    Current Music : Alicia Keys - A Woman's Worth

      Apparently he's landed himself a role in "Little By Little", because the role calls for an overly camp water, I think overly camp is such an overstatement.   Can I point that people are over reacting, to the possible closure of Les Mis. This cast is not going to be the "last" of Les Mis.  From August 26th - 2nd September, I might be flying out to Ibiza or some really cheap destination that's assured of heat. I ruled out Dubai because my mum told me that I would, to put it mildly, get "arse-fucked" out there. So, I'm of the opinion that it'd be safer If I don't go until next year.

There's also a stronger rumour that the show will hopscotch over to the Strand Theatre (putting in direct vecinity of Somerset House, Hilton's The Waldorf and Aldwych One. Two good Hotels).  Moving On, I'm getting tickets to either one of the Sunday Concerts of Les Mis in Exeter,  Rebecca is Fantine and I should follow that directly by an evening performance of Rebecca in Chicago *pauses* Nope, that's obsessive.

I got round to watching  Apocolpyse Now!  and it was excellent and featured a decidely difficult Marlon Brando, who had put on 42kgs before Filming even commenced. I suppose the Redeaux version is better than the original.   Also, I re-watched the Witches of Eastwick, Susan Sarandon *g*. Jerome Pradon is to appear in a programme called London, yaaay! He is the French Tourist.   I might go and see "A Funny Thing" again and pressgang the NT people into making a recording.
