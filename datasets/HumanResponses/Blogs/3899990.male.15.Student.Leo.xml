      Well, I went to the opening session last night and it was pretty good.  There are about 7,000+ students there and you wouldn't have believed how loud it was there.  We had some speeches from the national officers, and so on.  Also, if you watched  The Apprentice , do you remember a contestant named Kwambe (or something like that)?  Well, he was there and made a brief speech to the FBLA group.  All in all, it was pretty fun.  Today, I woke up late... at about 10:00 AM.  Then we went to Sonic to get some food and we headed out to the conference center.  I attended one workshop while I was there and it was pretty boring to say the least.  I'm about to head out to lunch in a few minutes and then I will be back at the conference center for more workshops and exhibits!  The award ceremony is on Saturday.  Wish me luck!

      Well, I was actually able to find a business center in the hotel.  So, I thought I'd make a post (@ $0.20/min).  Anyways, it's been really fun so far.  Let's take it step by step shall we?  Monday: My flight was scheduled at around 1:00 PM.  So, I arrived at the airport at 10:30 AM to get my tickets, check in, etc.  Then, once we boarded the plane, there were some technical problems and we had been sitting at the gate for at least 20-30 minutes.  After we had been sitting at the gate for that period of time, we were deplaned (all the passengers had to leave the plane).  They expected it to be up and running by 4.  But then after we were deplaned, the totally CANCELLED our flight.  And boy, was the whole Arizona FBLA group mad.  After waiting and waiting at the airport, they finally scheduled us for another flight at 6 PM.  Because of all the crap we had to go through, they gave us some free meal vouchers at the airport (which is the least they could do).  We had to get our food, to-go, then take a bus to another Terminal.  Finally, once we arrived at the other terminal, we were scheduled on our flight and we actually left the gate.  But, here's another twist:  Right when we were starting to take off, there was a dust storm and rain so we had to wait another 20 minutes.  Lastly, we actually took off.  We arrived at the Denver International Airport at about 9:30 PM local time (Denver is 1 hour ahead).  Tuesday: We all went to Six Flags and it was really fun.  I went on a few rides but on the first one I was screaming my head off.  You should've seen me.  After a couple rides, I went on a water one and got all drenched.  It felt really good but the water was kinda dirty.  After a few hours of fun at Six Flags, we went back to the hotel, changed, and got ready for dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Food was pretty good, fast, and we met some FBLA members from other states!  Wednesday:  Well, I was supposed to go River Rafting but if I didn't tell you, I'm not allowed to go (don't ask, LOL).  So, the whole AZ Delegation had to get up at 5:30 in the morning and board the buses at 6:00.  After they left, I just took a nice long nap (because I went to bed at about 2 AM the last night).  By the time it was 11:00 AM they already came back and I woke up, got some lunch and now I am here typing this lovely post.  For later today, the opening session starts (which means the actual FBLA Conference starts) and the opening session is about 3 hours long... watch me try to stay awake.  I hope I was able to entertain you with this lovely post!  And I'll update again in a couple days.  Hope you're having a great week!

      Yipee... I finally finished all my packing... at least I think.  I still have a few bits and pieces before I'm set.  If you forgot what I am packing for, here's a short description:  I will be attending the FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America) National Leadership Conference which will be held in Denver, Colorado.  It will be held from July 12th to the 18th.  I'll remember to take my camera and take some pictures for all of you to see!  And if the hotel is really good... I can post some entries while I'm there using their "Business Center".  Basically a business center has a copy machine, some computers you can use for internet, etc. for the guests of the hotel.  You guys are still free to call my cell at any time.  But if I am in the middle of the conference, I won't answer it; so just leave a message and I'll get back to you.  I hope all of you have a great week and don't forget about me!

      Well, I was looking around on the internet today and was in the forums at a site and I found this post about "Run Linspire" video.&nbsp; The video can be viewed at  urlLink http://www.linspire.com/run_linspire.php .&nbsp; Linspire is an alternative to Windows and as a matter of fact, they are against Windows and Microsoft 100%.&nbsp; Basically, it combines Windows and Linux together in one operating system.&nbsp; You can view more information about Linspire at  urlLink http://www.linspire.com  (formely known as Lindows).&nbsp; Take a look at it, I think you'll like it (especially if you&nbsp;don't like Windows, Microsoft, and/or Bill Gates.

              Name / Username:        urlLink Name Acronym Generator   From  urlLink Go-Quiz.com     That kinda describes me doesn't it? =)  Well, ever since I got back from Denver, I've been staying home pretty much the whole day.&nbsp; And you should too, with all this crazy inhumane weather!&nbsp; On a side note, Jaimie IMed me today and she said her computer was going really slow.&nbsp; So, I have her a few points and it helped her!&nbsp; I thought it might be a good idea to pass this information along to you guys also.&nbsp; If you're experiencing a slow computer, the #1 thing you do is clear any unnecessary files on your computer.&nbsp; Secondly, with the help of our little friend Micro$osft, there is a little utility called "Disk Cleanup".&nbsp; I'm not sure about other operating systems, but on Windows XP, it can be found at Start > Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Disk Cleanup.&nbsp; After going through that, it's also a good idea to defrag your hard drive.&nbsp; To understand what it is, here's a little definition from Microsoft:    "Disk Defragmenter is a system utility for analyzing local volumes and locating and consolidating fragmented files and folders. You can also defragment disks from a command line using the defrag command."     &nbsp;  This utility can also be found under System Tools (see above information).&nbsp; Depending on the size of your hard drive, this may take a few hours.&nbsp; I suggest you do this when you're in bed and let it do its work.&nbsp; Then, when you're done with this, clear your cache and cookies.&nbsp; These little objects are saved on your computer every time you visit a site.&nbsp; To clear cache and cookies, go to Start > Settings > Control Panel > Internet Options.&nbsp; Once you get there, click on the 'Delete Files' and 'Delete Cookies' buttons.&nbsp;   Once you have done all of this, restart your computer.&nbsp; Your computer should be running a little bit faster.&nbsp; If it doesn't work for you, at least I know it helped someone! And if you have any other suggestions, please use the comment feature and leave a suggestion in there for others.&nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp;

       Well since the wedding was over, this next couple days are pretty much free days. Staring the day off, we went to Starbucks and had a cup of coffee. Then, we went to have Dim Sum at this Chinese restaurant located in Arcadia, CA and the food was excellent. Then, we went to the Santa Anita mall and found some really great deals. For an example, I went to Macy's and got a pair of cargo shorts for only $9.00 and the original price was $35.00. There are some really great competitive deals here compare to what we have in AZ.  We spent about 3 hours at the mall and only walked out with 2 items total. We then went back to the hotel and rested for a while. Once it hit six, it was time to get ready and go to dinner. Again, we went to a Chinese restaurant and the best part was the food was both good and cheap. So far, you can't compare the food here to Arizona. We have the crappiest Chinese food there! That's about it for today.   Tomorrow's Plans:  Going to Beverly Hills (Rodeo Drive) and Hollywood. It'll be a full day adventure and of course, I am going to bring my digital camera and will take some pictures. I'll give ya the details tomorrow night!

       Today was a pretty fun today. I slept at about 3:30 this morning and woke up at 7. I only got about 3 hours of sleep. Then we went to the airport to catch out 10:30 flight. The flight went well and there were no delays J. We got into the Ontario airport and the first thing I noticed before we actually landed was all the SMOG in the air. It was really bad… nothing compared to Phoenix! The airport itself was busy. Luckily we didn’t land in the LAX airport. We got our rental car and drove out to have some lunch. We went to this restaurant called “Tokyo Lobby” and the food was alright but the service was horrible. The last time I was there (a year ago), it was a lot better (both food quality and service).  Well, then we went to my Godmother’s wedding. It was a great one. The actual wedding, which took place in the church, was about an hour and then there was a reception after the wedding. We spent about 5-6 hours at the reception and it was really fun. We danced and you should’ve seen me… I was WILD! Then, right before I was about to leave, the DJ picked my Dad and I to do the YMCA with 3 other guys (1 of them being Groom). Haha and I had the time of my life… I was entertaining everyone! I had a great time and after all that hassle through the airport and stuff, it was all worth it. In fact, I just got back from the reception! 4 hours after the reception, the bride and groom are off to Rome for a couple weeks!  Besides going to the wedding and seeing the Bride and Groom, I met a lot of people from the church we used to go to all the time. I’ll post some pictures soon and will show you some pictures of the wedding. That’s all for today! Tomorrow we have planned a lunch with my sister and her boyfriend. That’ll be fun. Otherwise, that’s all I have for tomorrow. I’ll let you know how it goes!

      Well, I am leaving for LA tomorrow and will be returning on August 2nd (just in time for the  urlLink "3-in1" Party !). I'm going for several reasons:  1) To attend my Godmother's wedding. 2) To visit my sister. 3) To eat lots and lots and lots of Chinese Food (which you know there is pretty much NONE here unless you cook it yourself and it's not even that good if you go to one of the restaurants here).  I will be bringing my Notebook (laptop) with me so I'll try to post every now and then. I'll still be online at night... so you can still IM me if you want to. I have to leave home at 6 AM tomorrow morning, have to be at the airport at 7 AM and the flight departs at around 10:30 AM. Which means, I can't stay up that late tonight... gonna go to bed earlier so I'll have a good start for tomorrow. While I'm in LA, I'll be thinking about all of you who are in the hot valley of the sun. =) Have a great weekend!

       Oh and I forgot to add one more thing (which isn't related to the party at all), I went to the orthodontics today and had a 2 hour appointment. I got spacers and will be getting my braces next week (Wednesday) just before school starts. I'm looking forward to them (because they need to be done and I know it's gonna hurt but it'll all pay off). Just thought I'd let all of you know!

       Haha, well we had a lot of fun at the party. Lisa, Ariella, Sylvia, Sylvia's Cousin, Jessica, and Jessica's Cousin were at the party. I came a little bit late and everyone was waiting for me to go to Ariella's house. But, when I finally came, we went to Ariella's house with this dolly full of water balloons. We had a little trouble getting there are first, but we eventually got it (with Lisa's help directing it).  After that, we went to the park and threw the water balloons around. The fun only lasted for a minute, but it was really nice and refreshing. After that, we went back to the house and jumped in the pool for about a half an hour or so and went back in and made smoothies. There were some interesting ingredients in there:

       Today is the day I am returning back to Phoenix. We had lunch at Regent Café and the food was excellent… couldn’t be any happier. Then, we went and drove around the city of San Gabriel/Monterey Park. At about 1:00 PM, it was about time to go to the airport and check-in, go through all that security and crap. In fact, I’m writing this at the airport as we speak.  As a reminder, tomorrow is the “3 in 1” Party which will be hosted at Lisa’s house. Should you have any questions, please contact Lisa on AIM at GurLhtt14. More information about the part can be found at  urlLink http://walty.deltacs99.com/3in1party/ . I should also mention there is an update for the party:  - There will be no swimming for security purposes. Please still bring and/or wear your swim suit to the party because there will still be a water balloon fight! - In addition, if you decide you still want pizza, bring an additional $2.00. The party may or may not have pizza, but it’s always a good idea to bring money just incase. - We will be watching a movie,  The Exorcist , which is rated R. If you are not allowed to view this movie without your parents’ consent, please ask them before you watch it. If you are not comfortable watching, you may leave the party or do something else on your own time. - You may contact me with any details by e-mailing  urlLink mhswalt@hotmail.com  or feel free to IM me on AIM at LaLFaN979. [For people who know my other e-mail address, do NOT add this one to your address book. This one is only used for public uses, thanks]. - One last thing, I may or may not be able to make the party. If I can make the party, I may be a little bit late because I have some morning errands before the party starts. But, it shouldn’t be a problem at all.  I look forward to seeing all of you at the party!

       Umm, the first thing I did was go out to early lunch at this Chinese dumpling house and even before the doors opened, there was already a line up. Yup, it was that good! Then, after we had lunch, I went to catch a 12:00 noon Mass at Church. After that, we drove about 45 minutes to Beverly Hills where Rodeo Drive was. There were a lot of great shops there and of course, expensive. I think the best part being in Beverly Hills was seeing all those really rich people and the people had Porsches, Mercedes’, and BMWs. We walked out of Rodeo Drive with absolutely nothing, but it was a great experience because I have never been there before (yes, I know it’s ironic even though I lived there for about 10 years). After all that hoopla, we went back to the hotel and rested for a while before dinner at 6 PM. Yes, we had Chinese food again and it was really good. It’s a shame I have to leave tomorrow and go back to that hot city called Phoenix. =P

       Well, today was a regular school day, pretty much like yesterday. But, I went to the movies tonight with  Sid ,  Bryce ,  Armando , and  8-10 other random people  from MHS and watched  Alien vs. Predator . The whole theatre was packed since it was the opening day. The movie itself was alright, it kinda leave you hanging so I'm expecting an  Alien vs. Predator 2 . Check it out, I think you might actually like it. Read more about  Alien vs. Predator  by  urlLink clicking here . -- Powered by Yahoo! Movies  I have absolutely no plans for the weekend except sleeping. If you wanna do something, feel free to gimme a call and we'll arrange something. I hope the first two days of school went well for you and have a nice weekend!

      Here's a recap of what happened today at school...     0 Hour: Spanish (Padillia) -  Well it's 0 hour, so I was kinda half asleep, just like the rest of the class. We did some main introductions about the class and about the teacher. Some "get to know each other" activities tomorrow!   1st Hour: English II (McCauley) -  Again, just some main introductions about the class. In addition, there were 44 of us in the class so it was very crowded. We did some introductions about each other and that was it.   2nd Hour: World Studies (Strong) -  We discussed some rules from the student handbook, dress code, and all that. Then, we discussed these questions: "What is history?" and "Why is history important?" for the remainder of the class. Since 1st and 2nd hour is a block, it felt like the class was too long.   3rd Hour: Lab Biology (Capps) -  This was probably the easiest class. All he did was introduce us to the class and the class rules. After that, we just got to chill and play around with some brainteasers for extra credit.   4th Hour: Lunch -  Well, I saw  Armando ,  Daniel ,  Sylvia , and some other people at lunch today. It was fun to see them again after the long summer. =) And, I hope to see more of you at lunch! Come by and see me, I'll either by at the ramada next to the cafeteria or in the G Food Court.   5th Hour: Accounting (Jones) -  Just like the previous classes, all introduction material for the first part. Then, we had to make this "shirt" out of paper and design it about our life. We had about 20 minutes to do that, most of everyone finished and we will share them with the class tomorrow. I think there were only a couple of Sophomores in that class, most of them were Juniors and Seniors.   6th Hour: Photo (LeWallen) -  We first had to sit outside the hall way and he called us in by alphabetical order and we have "teams" so we work with one another. He talked about the assignments, barely any introduction and what's due tomorrow along with his expectations. He kinda sounds like a professor from a Universirty (his "A" hour calls him that).   7th Hour: Math Topic 3 Geometry (Hughes) -  She was pretty nice for the most part. We have a quiz over the syllabus so I'm studying for that tonight. We went over that along with some questions just like in World Studies. One question was, "Why do you think it's harder for other students to learn math?" Then, we read this article about how the left and right brain works. According to that little article and the facts, I'm a right brainer (which isn't the best for math). That's all we did today for this class.     Only  178  days left until school is over!

       Well, today was a rather boring day. I got up at 6 in the morning for no absolute reason and went back to bed at around 8:30. I slept for about 3 hours more and woke up once again. The reason why I woke up early was probably cuz of my braces and everything. Speaking of those, they still hurt a little bit but it's getting better, as long as I take some Advil and I'll be fine. =)

       Well, I had an appointment today at 11:45 am to get braces and I finally got them. Geez, there's a lot of discomfort but a few Advil's will make it all better. =) After about an hour and a half, we went out to Damon's for lunch. There wasn't really a whole lot I could eat, so I ordered a chicken breast salad. It was a damn good salad but I couldn't eat any croutons because it was hurting me teeth. =( The sucky part is now I have to eat a lot slower than I used to. Oh, but the good thing is now I'm going to lose weight cuz I won't be eating as much! Good for me, cuz I need it!

       Well, open house wasn't so bad. I met all of my teachers and I found out some of the people who were in my class. When I walked in to my 1st and 2nd hour (block), this was the FIRST thing Ms. McCauley said to us:

       Well, I was supposed to go to Church today but I slept in by about 20 minutes so we couldn't make it. At about 10, I went to Starbucks, had some coffee and then went to Target. I went around the whole store and couldn't even find one thing to buy, but, on Tuesday that shouldn't be a problem cuz I have to buy school supplies  .

       I spent a couple hours researching for a new design and I finally found one that I think we might ALL like. Not only has the layout changed, but the comments feature has been removed. Why? It was removed because it wasn't even used by most of you so there's no point in having it there. Let me know if you have any problems viewing it or if you find any small errors. Thanks!

      Today was a typical Sunday, just like usual.  I went to Church today, then went to Starbucks and had my Mocha Frappuccino (mwahahaha  Sylvia  &  Lisa ), and went to Target to look around.  I had to buy a small binder for Photo (yahooooo another one to carry around) and this storage club was on clearance for $6.00 so I got that too.  I finished some of my homework (which took about 5 minutes), did some cleaning, and I'm now watching the Olympics.  There's only 5 more days till the weekend...
