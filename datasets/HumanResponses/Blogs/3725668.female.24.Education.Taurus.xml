						   Today I realised why a sleep routine is SOOOO important for me. I woke up at 7am (was woken up anyway) and actually got up and took my meds and everything seemed to go really well.  So I've had a really great day as far as bp goes even if I did spend half of it at the doctors. Apparently (according to WD) I get aggresive if I don't eat at regular intervals (I'm hungry!) so doc says 'eat regulary, just hypoglycemia'.  I made enquiries today to enrol is an Australian Druidry course. As they are connected to the Order back in the UK they have access to a lot of materials I could never see otherwise and I am very keen to do this. I feel that it is the right time to continue my studies. I have been opening my mind by doing tarot readings every few days for other people and I have now progressed to doing them for people I don't know or meet except through email and I'm doing better than even I expected. This more than anything confims that now is the right time to move forward.

						   Well I have actually managed a week of posts! I am feeling very proud of myself :)  Today is my 'therapy day'. Basically along with everything else I also have 'anxiety disorders' (whats wrong with not wanting to talk to people?) and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( gee I'm crazy cos my socks go on before my shoes.....everyday!).  So I get to go to therapy every fortnight to devise 'strategies' so I can 'cope' with the 'situations'. What therapy REALLY is, is 1 hour of me rewording everything the therapist says so it sound stupid and messing up his whole session. Every week I TRY to be good but it never happens.  Anyway, today he decided that while I'm packing to move I need to throw out some stuff (OCD issue). Like He is a genius! What did I JUST tell him I'd been doing all weekend? I could talk to a mirror for an hour and get better therapy.  I also did my bowling today to make up for Sunday and just wasn't in the mood (therapy day can do that to you) so I sucked. Only 1 game over average.  And for those that can't tell most of my post today is made up of frustrated sarcasm ;)

						   Nothing in this world is real.  The pain is not even real. it is only the grieving of the death of the illusion. Nothing matters. It doesn't matter if I live or if anyone else does. We don't exist. it is all just a delusion. The relationships we are are just figments of our non existant imaginations.  Why should we even bother to try? Everything ends anyway, why let anything begin? Why does it hurt so much to cry when the pain is not real? Why does anything pretend to exist? If nothing exists then bipolar doesn't exist so I should be happy, but I can't be because emotions don't exist either.  This is my head today. Welcome to my delusional insignificant mind.

						   I really do enjoy the days when I don't see anyone. Its not that I'm a hermit its just that if I don't see anyone I can't upset anyone.  WD is away at his parents place for the weekend and due to last nights migraine I cancelled ten pin bowling today. So I spent the day packing for my move (two more weeks!)and catching up with the happenings in the online world.  A day like today is very calming for me as there are no stress factors to trigger my bipolar and I can just be me for a day.  I have been planning for a couple of days to define what I believe within my path, so here it is.  I believe: 1. That everything alive has a spirit which is connected to the spirit of the earth. 2. there is a god and goddess as the universe must have balance and so they are of equal importance. 3. this god and goddess have different roles and names as the seasons rotate 4. seasons are extremely important as they define how the spirit of each organism is reacting with others.  This is the main underpinning of my belief. There is of course much more but it would take me days to write everything.

						   Well today went much better for me.  Not too much problems with the meds and I spent the day with one of my brothers. He is 14yo so at the right age to be able to do things with that we both enjoy like going window shopping and seeing movies.  Today we saw Harry Potter. He had been already but had been disturbed through it by other 'patrons' so wanted to go again. I found it to be a really good relaxing time.  WE also spent a good bit of time over hot chocolate discussing our beliefs. I explained to him what it meant for me as a Druid and how his path should be something of persol importance to him and not just to go with what everyone else does. He is still at an age for defining what he believes, most of his beliefs are Christian (which I have no problem with) although he is also open to many other ideas. I took him to my local pagan shop and said I would buy him a stone of his choice. He chose a snowflake obsidian then asked if I would instead pay half for him to buy a bracelet of the same stone. He seemed very drawn to it and later he even discussed how good it felt on him, so I feel that even if he remains a Christian he will be an open minded one.  The downside to today is that I have a migraine beginning. :( But I wont let that ruin a good day. I'll sign off and go to bed.

						   Today sucked!  I got up at 6am to do that assignment that I didn't do last night (bad me) and felt ok. Then I took my tablets and had breakfast like I do every morning and BANG! My meds decided it was going to be a bad day.  Everything I ate or did made me feel sick, trying to go shopping (for my partner's 35th b'day party) was agony as I'd lost most of my fine motor control (fingers etc) and a good part of my gross motor control (walking etc). Oh and my speech got slurred. Yay.  And periodically I get a blast of pain through my head that almost knocks me over.  But we did get the things for his party. We are going with a Lord of the Rings/ Harry Potter theme. Basically wizards and magic etc. (SMM & all If I could afford the flights I would bring you all here). I'm planning the whole thing as I really wanted something to keep me busy through the uni holidays.  I also wanted to do this to say thankyou to WD (my partner) for everything he does for me and not leaving me (yet!). With all my behaviours I'm not the easiest to live with and he deals with a lot. I don't have a choice about living with Bipolar, he does and is still here, I can never thank him enough.  My other plan for the holidays is to begin the next phase of my Druid learning. I'll write more about that tomorrow when I'm not feeling so fuzzy.

						   I have an assignment due tomorrow but instead I'm typing here. Welcome to the world of Bipolar. Where your meds make your brain fuzzy and the words just won't come out right.  The problem is of course thatI have already had my 2 week disability extension. After this I'll just fail if I don't hand it in, and its not a subject I want to repeat.  After having my tooth pulled out yesterday it has been so hard to eat and if I don't eat regularly it messes up my brain even more and I get really aggressive and snappy.  For those who know something about bipolar I take 100mg Zoloft and 800mg Tegretol everyday. For those who don't know (most of society) the Zoloft is my anti depressant to deal with low moods and the Tegretol is my mood stabiliser which is to stop me going manic ( a side effect of anti depressants).  i'm also moving on July 12 so I have to get everything packed and ready by then. Oh did I mention that sleep deprivation and stress are to the two major contributing factors for a bipolar episode :)

						   Well I finally got my 'blog' set up.  I'm Teejah the Bipolar Druid. I am a 24 year old University student studying a degree in education. I live in Sydney, Australia.  I live with an illness called Bipolar Disorder that affects my moods and behaviours. Sometimes it can be really difficult to live with but my medications are supposed to help with that.  The path I have chosen to live my life by is that of a Druid. Even within the pagan beliefs Druidry is uncommon so many people don't understand what it is about and I'll be talking more about that as I travel along through my world.

						    Well I finally moved and I'm sleeping on the one little part of my bed that isn't covered by 'stuff'. Uni has started back up again so it's getting much harder to sort all the stuff out and put it where it needs to go.   And getting online is almost non existant. Our area is not enabled for broadband even tho its only a couple of streets from previous house! So to get the Internet we have to go through all the hassle of a second phone line. So for now I'll be surfing at uni.  BP is going quite well considering the move. My moods have been much better lately and I'm even picking up a fifth sunject at uni for the semster. I thought I wouldn't cope with 3.   Well it's great to be back, I've missed my little blogger.

						   My first miss! :(  Well Tuesday's mania onset acctually became a s*&t period of mixed state. I hate them cos you kind of feel depressed but have bursts of manic energy and thought but still related to depression topics. So basically I sent WD round the bend trying to follow my moods. he eventually gave up and left me lying on the lounge room floor.  Today I was just in a bad mood. Which was not a good start to the day as we were taking 2 5yo (his son A & my brother D)to the aquarium for the day. so we set off with me grumpy and 2 kids with the 'are we there yet?' and 'is this our stop?' all the way into the city (1 hour train ride). then D is crying cos I slapped his butt for swearing. then A is crying cos he wants to sit where D is sitting. The train ride does not improve my mood.  we finally get to the aquarium and have some lunch which went ok. Then we went to line up to get in and found the queue was huge. so I ducked around to the group bookings section to enquire as I had "forgotten" where teachers go in (as we go free). So they let me and WD go in free and the kids were too short for her to see and they walked straight past! So we all got in for free instead of about $60. Not bad seeing as our teaching cards had expired and we can't find our new ones........  Once we got inside the "experience" continued. Apart from 'pick me up' 'no pick me up' 'i can't see', the first few tanks went ok. Then while we were talking D snuck ahead. NEVER let a 5yo sneak ahead into the CROCODILE exhibit! The exhibit has a croc in a pond and you can view from in front, ground level, or behind from a viewing platform, 12ft up. D had gone up onto the view platform and then had proceeded to climb the glass ie. see through, hand rail to get a better view. WD ran up and grabbed him down (scaring the S%*T out of him in the process) and threatened to throw him in and by the time I got up the top I found a crying 5yo whimpering about not wanting to be crocodile food.  With that out of the way the rest of the tour was rather uneventful.of course by the end of the day I had to remove D's soaking wet shirt as his sleeves 'fell down' every single time he was playing in a touch pond (were kids can pat star fish etc). And then came the gift shop. 'I want this' 'but you said you wanted that' 'i want this and that' 'no you only get one'. The highlight of my day was getting out to find that WD had bought me a NEMO plushie to cheer me up. :)  The train ride home I don't remember much of as I collapsed at some point between redfern and parramatta. I managed to then prop myself up against a wall until we got a seat at blacktown. it was all a bit hazy anyway.  And so here I sit completely buggered. WD & A are having a boys dvd night, Harry Potter I think, and I am left peacefully by myself.

						   why are we really here?  If we are here to learn as WD tells me, then why do babies die? Did they just learn REALLY quick? O r were they only born for the purpose of teaching others?  And then why do we die? Wouldn't learning be a lot more productive if we didn't keep dying (I believe in a form of reincarnation)? By the time we are old enough to converse we have forgotten everything we learned last time and have to start over.  So then what IS wrong with suicide? Wouldn't I just be helping by teaching others about bipolar if I died? Maybe the statistics (2/3 of people with bp die from suicide/suicide related injuries)aren't bad enough yet for people to learn anything from us?  I've heard so often that as an adult I should be in control of my behaviour and thoughts and feelings, then I wouldn't have a problem. Do you tell someone with diabetes to be in control of their insulin? No you tell them to take medication. Do you tell someone with cancer to be in control of their cells? No you give them medication and treatment. BP is causes by my brain chemicals not working the way they should and just like many other illnesses I have no control over how my brain produces or doesn't produces certain chemicals. Thats why I take medication but it can't always cater for my needs and sometimes I will 'act all bp' but tough. Get over it. We have just as much right to live as anyone else and as long as we dont hurt anyone you shouldn't care how I or any other BP acts.

						   I was very BAD this morning. WD gave me my wake up call (from his weekend away) and I went back to sleep for another hour. Messes me up a bit for the day.  I went bowling and did a good job :) got two games over average.   Oh and I got a WHOLE box packed ready for the move!   I'm having a quiet night now that WD is back. He took me out for dinner and now we are watching some tv so I best be off the computer.

						   I am BUGGERED!  I had no choice but to get up early today because a friend was coming to pick me up for work. We got called in to work all day which was good as we have school holidays now and there is no work in school holidays.  While I was there my boss asked about what my medication was for and when I told her that I have bipolar she was really good about it. She just asked me questions about it and how my medication affected me. They are really nice people and a great company to work for, I'll be sad to leave them when I finish uni and move away.  And so I got absolutely no packing done and I'll have to get up early tomorrow to get a start on it. although then I have bowling, and then monday i'll be tutoring my brothers........well I'm sure the packing will get done SOME time :)

						   another early morning and another good day. I was even semi awake this morning when WD did his daily duty and woke me up. I have however had a roaring sore throat all day and NOTHING will get rid of it.  So today I collected boxes and packing material for my move (and read my books after WD left). I can't believe there is only 10 days left! Hopefully this will be the last move until the end of uni in 18months time.   Its a bit of a chilly night so I think i'll shower then snuggle up in bed with a good book to keep me company as per usual WD is away for the weekend with his son. I only wish I hadn't given him the address for this page, now he can check up on me while he is gone :P

						   Another early morning and another great day! Now I just need to be able to wake my self up this early everyday.  As I am on holidays and have not much to do (except plan a birthday party, move house.......) I went nuts at the library and borrowed about 15 books (and already had about 10 at home waiting). I can't help it, if a book looks interesting (particularly non fiction) then I grab it, I just LOVE learning. Putting knowledge inside my head and adjusting what I know, assimilating this bit with that bit, proving or disproving theories, I could (and intend to) do this forever.  WD is going away with his son (5) this weekend so I stocked up on supplies (food, not books:) ) and then went to work for a few hours. It is the last wek of term so we gave all the kids certificates for how well they had progressed this year. I was especially impressed with a boy. He is WD student learning maths from a program I designed. At the start of the year he could count ok and add small numbers. Now he can add any single digits, count backwards a little, identify numbers before and after a number etc. I was just so happy with him and so were his parents so it made a great night.  Then I came home and got a HUGE shock. One of my flatmates was out of the hospital. About a months ago one of my flatmates was in a car accident (as a pedestrian) and was taken to hospital. she is still there with a broken leg, two broken arms, a fractured skull, and some other minor injuries. A week later another flatmate was taken away cos he had had a nervous breakdown. So he is home tonight and doing ok. Its really good.

						   Now that it seems to be working again!  WD and I were in court again yesterday. Both sets of lawyers came together and discussed it with the registrar. Then they called WD and his ex in to talk about it. The registrar said to her that he is asking for very little extra time with his son and if it goes to trial she will spend up to $15 000 and still lose. Her response was that she had already spent that so far and she still thinks she is right.  So now the lawyers have 3 weeks to sort it out and get her to agree or we go to trial in November.  Just what we need to be worrying about during semester.

						    I have actually managed to get here a second day in a row! Yay!   It's really because I have a reading to email to a client before I go bowling. Bowling is getting hard. My average keeps going up a little each week and it is getting so much harder to beat it. I focus on the maths of each bowl; I need 20 more points and I have 4 frames left so I need 5 per frame to make it etc. that settles my nerves and I always know where I am during a game.  I am having so much trouble losing weight lately and I have a feeling that it could be by meds. A side effect of 2 of them is weight gain so it kind of worries me that I may not be able to do anything about it. I need a new script this week so I'll have a chat to my doctor. He says my weight isn't causing me any health problems, all my tests are fine, I should just eat healthy and exercise. I'm just glad I have a partner, I don't what to be overweight AND BP AND trying to find someone. If he can put up with all those things then I'm keeping him :)
