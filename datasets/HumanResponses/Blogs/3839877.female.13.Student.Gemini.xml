      What would he look like? That depends. I totally fall for dark hair and unique eyes. Race isn't that big of a deal, another thing that depends. Though, I love the 'goth' scene. ^^;  Sense of humor? Of course! I want a guy that can joke around, and just be plain fun. But, I also want him to be serious when the time comes.   Protective? Definately, that is such a huge turn on for me. I don't want him to over protective and jealous, yet I don't want him to not give a damn either. The perfect balence, yet tilted more towards very protective.  Outgoing? I'm EXTREMELY shy.  I don't really like the outgoing type that much, they make me a bit uncomfortable. I'd want a guy that was shy, yet a bit more outgoing than myself.  Romantic? Totally. The whole roses and chocolates thing are a must. I'm the beach type, I love 'moonlight walks on the beach' That whole thing, I guess i'm just a dreamer and romantic like that.   Adventurous? That is an absolute MUST. I'm really adventurous myself.  Camp, fish, ride horses. You name it!  (Not everything, mind you.)   I'll add to this later.

      Who else do you think I'd post about!? I fuckin' worship this guy! (No, not really. Just love him to death. xD) The sexy, long, dark hair. The long, pale face. Those pouty, full lips. I don't give a damn who he worships. I don't care what he sings about. I love his music, the lyrics are incredible. He is such a brilliant man! He'll forever have a place inside me...

      These past few days have been extremely rough for me. My two best friends hate each other, so i'm caught in the middle and torn... I don't feel like going into detail. I've gotten hardly any sleep... Speaking of which, I had an extremely sick dream that I fucked and married one of my male cousins... The one in the dream is non-existant. But its still quite creepy... Right now I fucking feel like killing my parakeet. >. I swear i'm going to kill M. Night Shyamalan. He's such a sell-out, and his movies suck ass major. I hate  Signs . I've taken a bunch more quizzes..  urlLink GO LOOK!  Trying to get Adobe Photoshop CS to work, total pain in the ass. Watched  One Hour Photo  for the thousandth time in my fucked life. So fucking bored... *Hums to herself for whatever reason.*  For a list of fucked things that currently happened in my life.. I slept on my shoulder wrong, aches like hell. Didn't see  The Terminal  as planned, its gone from our theaters already, i'll have to go to a different city to see it. I go see  King Arthur  today/tomorrow instead. ^^ A bit aggrivated, had to skip my bible study today as a result. Thankfully.  I'm half deaf because of a damn song that had weird noises, and I can't find the one I want; Fefe Dobson- Take Me Away.  My grandmother thinks i'm Manson obsessed; Both Charles & Marilyn.  Marilyn; DUH!     Charles; No! Once was. =.= This program isn't working; Guess. My dog is in pain; Flies biting her ears.  I think I'm off to bed...   3:13 AM Watching 28 Days Later. Still bored and really hungry, must eat... Might post in a few, dunno.

       Cheria  left earlier today. Kinda lonely and quiet without her. Downloaded a bunch of   Breaking Benjamin   songs, my new favorite band. xD Extremely bored, took a few more quizzes, quite proud of my results.  Went into   Hot Topic   to see if they had my   Foamy   dvd. They didn't. I'm seriously going to get those boots and that top. Wicked! xD I can't seem to find one of my favorite books,   Cut  . I think  Cheria  took it with her, she was reading it late last night. Though i'm not sure. Trying to   Adobe Photoshop CS   to work, no luck. -.- Still thirsting for  blood .  Watched a bit of tv,   Higher Ground  ,   Seriously Weird  ,   Weird Science  ,    The Tribe.  ect. ect  Went out to   Wal-Mart   for a bit, picked up another pack of   Pepsi Twist  . ^^ Did a bit more dreamweaving, fixed a few things on  ED . Killed my  parakeet . Nah, I wish. XD!  So bored...  12:30 AM Tired... I'm gunna go to bed in a bit. 'Night, night. x)

      1:35 PM Just woke up. Slightly tired. I'll post again, later...  2:14 PM Just ate food. No longer tired. Not much happening yet, we'll see.  4:55 Nothing yet...  5:45 Cheria & I went to a large grove, swamped with wasps and bees.  We ran like hell. Post again later...  6:18 Bored, we've been sitting here.  Watching  South Park  almost all day. Whee! Go Cartman.  7:17 We went for a quick walk in the neighbrhood, Cheria chatted with this guy I know from school. o.o  8:33 Just got back from a boring fireworks show. -.- I did get five Mozerella sticks and a grilled cheese sandwich.  9:39 Downloaded a couple of  Slipknot  songs. ^^  10:31 And I finally get on. Cheria has been wasting time by downloading 20+ R&B, rap and hip hop songs.  12:45 Ugh soo bored, watching more  South Park . Finished watching some thingy on  Playboy .  1:46 Nothing...  2:56 I just got in deep shit for being up so late. I can't get on my computer or tv tomorrow. Cheria can't spend the next night here.  This sucks ass. I fuckin' want to kill someone.  3:33 I just had this incredibly erotic thought of sex in the rain, on a covered patio. Or maybe just on the ground, a really rough fuck in the pouring rain. Now that's my idea of a good time. ^^ I'm such a freak like that. Gotta love it!

      My first post in this thing. God, I have way too many journals and shit. Took some quizzes and stuff, they're on my  urlLink LJ . I think i'll just stay walled up in my room the whole time, i'm not really social, prefer being alone. I might go out for 15 minutes then come back inside, but other than that, i'm staying right here in my dark, comfortable room, alone...  Hmm, i'm just in a really strange mood, I feel like calling myself Satan's Lost Angel, Satan's Missing Angel, Satan's Missing Female Soul. ect. ect.   7:31 PM Later On... I went outside for several minutes, listening to my IPod and pretty much ignoring everyone. I didn't talk with my new relatives from Canada, didn't seem like they wanted to meet me. But, there is 20+ people outside, I don't want to be around my family right now, I keep getting these cold glares from Jovondai and her friend. Jovondai has always been such a bitch to me, always rude. I think she hates me. She's not my list either... Cheria is okay, hyper, she's so spiffy and cheerful. Preppy, popular-ish. Ugh.  All I want to do is RP or talk to someone, that's all I need. Just to have some human connection with someone other than my family. An actual conversation. Luke is excellent for that, though it seems these past few days he's been so busy, I just don't want to bother him. But he is all I really have that understands. Selle does, but not the way he does. They both have ups and downs, I don't know. I just want to talk to him...  At least this worrying and shit has stopped. Thank god for this medicine.   7:55 PM Went back outside again, out of total boredom.  Hmm ate two hot dogs, listened to some more MM. More cold glares, why is everyone so worried about me? Its like they think i'm going to commit suicide right in front of them or something. All I want to do is talk wth Luke, or someone. My PS2 is completely fried, lightning must've hit it. Though i'm not upset as I never played it that much anyway. I think i'll go back outside in a bit. Though, I don't know.   8:34 PM Bored to death, I went outside yet again, and i'm not going back. Updating this is much more fun.  I had to listen to HipHop and R&B. It completely blocked out my MM because that's how loud it was. So I came back inside. Everyone in my family hates Rock, Metal, Alternative and Industrial. And i'm still a bit hungry, I should've eaten more. -.- I think i'm going to screw around on Furc and try to find something to do. To top that off I have to listen to my family scream and shout.    9:09 PM Nope, didn't go outside. I'm sitting here, listening to firecrackers shoot off, people screaming, shouting asnd cheering. I absolutely hate it. > Alone, bored... Messing around on Furc. Dreamweaving a bit. Just finished downloading  urlLink modules  for  urlLink Messenger Plus!  I'm currently downloading a crack for Adobe Photoshop CS. ^^  1:55 AM Kinda tired... Whee! Did a bit of RPing. God, I missed good RP. ^^ Cheria, Jimmie & I got into several stupid, but heated debates. 1. How much money prostitues make. 2. Why people kill prostitutes. 3. How many people are in the world.  Some others, which I can't quite remember at the moment. Then we watched the Nick Berg execution.  WHEE! That was some awesome shit! ^^ I think i'm going to bed now. -.-   urlLink DeviantART   urlLink Diaryland   urlLink LiveJournal

        THE OUTCAST. It's not that nobody likes you, it's that you like nobody. You tend to keep to yourself, and you don't hand your trust out to just anyone. Even if you do have friends, it's a tight circle of people that you really, really trust. That's not that much of a bad thing, but you should allow yourself to experience life a little more...    urlLink   What Type of Woman Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

         Cougar/Mountain Lion/Puma ~ The Puma spirit represents power, grace and stealth in darkness, but its real power lies in the silence of its eerie, unblinking stare that seems to bore deep into one's soul.  This teaching can help us to discover the benefits of concentration, deep contemplation and prayer.  As we peer into the darkness of the unknown to feel its power, we can be guided by our puma friend to the light on the other side. The puma is extremely quiet during the hunt. It knows when to be invisible and when to make its awesome presence known.  Silence is its sword and power.  Silence is highly respected among American Indians and is seen as a holy state of consciousness as we quietly behold the grace and glory of the Creator.  It is said that silence speaks words of the Great Mystery. When the student is ready, the puma teacher may bring knowledge of this powerful medicine.

          In medieval Europe, dragons were considered mostly evil and a generally bad omen. Christianity linked the dragon with Satan because of the dragon's snake-like appearance. However, to the Orient cultures the dragon was a symbol of wisdom and royalty. It was a benign animal and the fifth creature of the Chinese zodiac. It resided over the east and the sunrise. It was also said to bring rain and the springtime. The dragon is interesting because it combines all four elements: air, earth, fire, and water. It could fly, had the horns of a ox, breathed fire, and resided over the moon.   urlLink  What mythical beast best represents you?

      Take the quiz:  urlLink "how much do you talk to yourself?"    weird??  Does having this "quirk" mean you're abnormal? Does it mean you're an oddball? Does it mean you're going mad? Actually it just means you have plenty to talk about, but not always someone around to whom you can speak. Perhaps you're just bursting with emotion, imagination, or the need to communicate. (As a child, you probably talked to an imaginary playmate.)  Under the right circumstances, talking to yourself can be a delightful way to release mental "steam" and to confide in a friend (namely, yourself). As long as you allow room for other friends to join in! Think about it. Talk it over with yourself.
