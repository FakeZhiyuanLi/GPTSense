      Ijust got back from LA. I needed something to do so I looked up shows and ended up getting to see Deathray Davies that same night. I brought back shirts and stickers.my brother in law was impressed enough to purchase one of there albums.they were followed by this stoner/boogie band called Honky which allegedly contains and ex-Butthole Surfer.I didnt dig them too well.they were like the melvins and ZZ top combined. they even had redneck cowboy hats and silly 3 inch long goatees. their antics consisted of tipping there hats and torturing the audiance with between song chatter. they have a small lesbian following.  I didnt know the davies had like 6 members. I met the singer, his brother, and the second keyboardist.he didnt much care for honkey either.  thanx to colt from poulain for the correspondence. I hope we meet again except a show where WE are playing too.  just got ozma,hey mercedes!, and deep elms "emo is awesome/evil" sampler all discounted down to nuthin at the hot topic.  turns out coachella is outragously overpriced.Im feel ill thinking about it. I should bust in that bitch woodstock style.  I cant find a proper album by The Fall at any mainstream outlet.did S.D.R.'s "diary" album go out of print?  I cant wait for the saves the day show with the fire theft(speaking of SDR),grandaddy and DIOS

      Yesterday thousands of demonstrators marched (or rather walked, lazily) through the streets of the dead city of Warsaw  - with no people downtown except policemen on every other corner, against the brown background of wooden covers nailed to the shop windows and doors. Almost every commercial or public establishment downtown was covered for protection against the supposedly violent anti-globalists. But to the astonishment of the people of Warsaw, and the police themselves, no violent acts occurred. The worst thing that happened is that the protesters threw rolls of toilet paper on the policemen lined up behind the barriers. And while they did that, they shouted: "Assholes!"  Did I see all of that with my own eyes? Unfortunetly not. I wish I had seen the colorful parade of anarchists, socialists, Radical Cheerleaders, and heard the music playing from the speakers on one of the platforms: reportedly ska and punk! But I wasn't able to. Well, maybe next time. Anarchist leaders declare that their movement is just beginning to gather momentum and more demonstrations like that should be expected! Long live freedom, long live rock and roll! To hell with the army and the corrupt government!

        Robert de Niro  You are like the cult actor of the 1970s, Robert de Niro! Universally admired by men, the iconic tough guy, slightly demented, but irresistible. Always balancing on the edge of what's right and wrong, legal and illegal, safe and dangerous, you somehow manage to keep it together. You pretty much hate women because perhaps you've been hurt in the past. But you never know - maybe one day an angel will cross your path who will huide you and you'll see the world in different light.    urlLink   Which cult movie actor are you like?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      We're sitting at a little round table together relaxed soft music flowing from the speakers some early Radiohead or something like that and we're just sitting, silent looking at each other you are so calm I'm just waiting for the next gig a swift change from the past Sometimes I think it was but a dream living so many miles apart each of us immersed entirely in their own drama Well, except that I really really wanted to be in yours too and here we are sitting so close together so calm and in place my immense problems are finally long gone my history far behind me a mere memory of sick helplessness

      How do you define good taste? Is image important? Can you skip the way the band members look and just listen to the music? How far can you go with jewelry? Are bandanas cheesy? How to dress to a concert when it's very cold? Can you mix styles? How "manly" is a girl allowed to look? How "womanly"? Which kind of second-hand t-shirts with prints are the coolest? How many sport style elements can you incorporate into your club look?  These are the questions that occupy me today. Rethinking style in clothing. It's because I saw an old Polish film from the early 80s about a girl who is trying to make a name for herself in rock, and many performances by mainstream rock and underground punk bands were featured in it. And the things I saw there (as far as looks are concerned) only confirmed my opinion of the 1980s in fashion - bad, bad, bad style! Still, some of the things I heard were really cool (of course what I mean here are performances by Dezerter and Rejestracja). So today I decided to think about style and its importance in music.

      I recently lost my job. I sort of wanted to lose it actually. Kind of like a relationship that no longer works. Im looking for a job now that doesnt involve much responsibility. too bad the nearest hot topics is at least 2 hours away. I wouldnt have to dress up for the job interview. when no one else is at home I like to play "setting sun" by the chemical brothers thru one blown speaker really loud while I perfect my robot dance. it keeps my neighbours on theyre toes. Im convinced one of my neighbours is actually a pirate.he has a beard,swords and exotic birds.he's an eyepatch away from pillaging the neighbourhood. I special ordered my monochrome black chuck taylor hi-tops, for job interviews and work.hard to find vegan work shoes. my new favorite band is The Shins, but Oh Inverted World! era, I didnt like Chutes Too Narrow as much as the critics. its BeachBoys-esque in a an updated indie rock way, Like another favorite band of mine, Dios. I started cutting my own hair again (and dying it heavy Blue-Black). recent purchases: violent femmes-rock!!! best of elvis costello Belly-sun ep PJ Harvey-rid of me romeo and julliet movie soundtrack rock music: a tribute to weezer (I got the dvd and I still need to get the blue album deluxe edition) Ozma-spending time on the Borderline Rufio-EP The Smiths-best of volume 2  next time Im going to write a thesis on the lyrical conten of the Sugarcubes "lifes too good" album. Gotta see The new Pixies DVD cant wait for the jandek film to come out on DVD too! (I played dome jandek this morning for my sis and her husband.he compared it to Jim Morrison's poetry albums!)  oh and the pictures. the black-haired young man in the reggie and the full effect t shirt is of course me, and the little girl washing dishes is my niece when she was about 3. I love that pic, you can read into it on so many different levels. a heavily photoshopped version is going to be used in flyers and as a single sleeve. and the pic of me was taken in riverside CA in a motel before the NOFX show and before the Absinthe started to kick in. thats Joe X. seated behind me and an Absinthe bottle by my hand. marta,please send some raNdom pics for me to put on here.

      Tonight, while looking through my old photo albums in which I also keep various postcards and stickers and other cool stuff I get from friends, I've discovered an old postcard I got with four blurry color photos of Baghdad from last year and a little hadwritten comment in the middle "Wish I wasn't here..." That just blew me away. I thought bloody hell, this card's message is still so valid today! Sadly enough. Bad news keep coming in, and I keep watching them and asking myself, can we really do nothing about it? Is this democracy all about?   "Ever get the feeling you've been CHEATED?"

      She said. They laughed. And in less than five minutes, they were dead.  So beware all you terrorists, assasins and murderers! When this war is over (or maybe even sooner) you will be caught. And then you will be judged in your own country, according to your law, before the eyes of your victims' families, maybe by your neighbor, whom you threatened, or who was threatened by someone like you. And you'll be convicted, and banned for the rest of your life from the community you pretended to fight for. With no chance of dying honorably in the fight for your cause. That will be your punishment: dying alone, in a stinking, cold cell, with no one to talk to but your self-pity and disgrace.

      I wonder should I get myself a t-shirt with Jarvis Cocker. I've seen some old Pulp videos recently and he seems very photogenic, especially live... anyway. I found out that his band has been around since 1978! That's a very long time... so it dates back to the time of punk. That's cool. I'd never say he was that age..   Soundtrack for today: 1. The White Stripes "Hotel Yorba" 2. Grant Lee Buffalo "The Whole Shebang" 3. Pulp "We Are the Boyz" 4. Venus In Furs "Bitter-Sweet" 5. Pidzama Porno "Antifa (the same gang)

      Does fear accompany us in most of the things we do every day? In most decisions we make? Every time we are facing a choice? Every time we do something important? Is fear manageable? Is it really a good thing if we're afraid of fear itself? What does it mean to be afraid of fear?  Many people, animals and things in this world have a double nature. Does everyone have a good and a bad side to them? Are we harmless professors in broad daylight and violent beasts at night?  How can you get to know the true nature of things? Of people? How do you ever know if the person you love is not a cruel, vicious creature that'll use you and abandon you without any warning? How do you know if the person who is thought to be a ruthless murderer is not the dearest of your friends? How do you find that out before you get to fight them?  These are the questions that were asked in the latest Harry Potter film, "Prisoner of Azkaban." A film more gloomy and sending even more shivers down your spine than could be expected. A film funny and wise. For people who like questions, not just answers.

      Ive just heard Commander Venus, and Im very impressed. Conor BrightEyes first band, and also we have future members of the faint and cursive and the president of Saddlecreek Recs,apperantly.  Like a depressed,corn-fed Pavement. Conor Oberst is a mere high school student here,belieing his age thru his lyrics(my sister compared his vocal style here to Renee Zellweger's lead vocal take is Empire Records with "Coyote Shivers"). and its true,whoevers doing the lead vocals sounds very much like a kid still. however this was recorded (it was either a home 4-track or a hole-in the wall local rental studio) it sounds too good. Im viciously jealous now.  Richard Cheese And Lounge Against The Machine are doing a residency on Carson Daly this week. its great.

      Last Sunday was a special day in Warsaw, Poland. A day of beautiful, sunny weather, just like 60 years ago. A day of reunions after decades of separation. A day of speeches and of silence. A day of lighting candles, walking and reminescing.  And on every street, every square there were posters saying: "PW 1944" or "WAR SAW"  and others, showing people with white and red arm-bands on their arms.  And suddenly, this place felt beautiful again. It felt like it had felt before the war - a proud, cultural capital, diverse and distinguished. It felt brave and important. For a long moment in time.
