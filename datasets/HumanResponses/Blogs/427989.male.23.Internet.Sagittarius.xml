      Well I'm back home now. Actually, I'm back at work which is even worse!  Oh well, all good things come to an end I guess.  In case you can't tell I had a great time in Madrid. I reafermed my friendships with Tsalika and Michele and also made some really good friendships too.  I arrived back on Saturday evening to be greated in Liverpool by 60MPH winds and a very bumpy landing. My little baby was still in the car park, she started first time and got me home safe and sound.  All the pictures from the trip can be found  urlLink here   Jay.

      So I´m here in Madrid!!  I´m in an internet cafe after having a beer or two. I think we were going to the prado museum but it closed at 7 so i  don´t think we have the time. We´ll probably go there tomorrow.  Last night we eat at a nice little place, I had an amazing pork dish. Then we went to a few bars. I was too tired to get in to the party sprit though. Tonight I hope I´ll be more awake.  Don´t know what where doing later tonight. I´ll be good I´m sure.  A dopo tutti.  Jay.

      blogging from liverpool airport on possibly the worst keyboard in the history of the world! If there are mistakes then its not my fault!  So far so good. Carparking was stright forward. Check in no problem. A fair bit of security but I thinbk thats to be expected. Still. I'm in the departure lounge right now waiting for my gate to open. So far no delays of any sort.  All is good.  Jay.

      It seems I'm blogging more at the moment. This is a good thing. I don't care to much if you think that the site now looks crap, but you have to admit, it's a fast download now. You may or may not know but I'm off to Madrid on Monday and I've been doing all my last minute shopping. I did quite well today. I've got a nice pair of going out shoes (to replace my current dog eared pair), a few new shirts and t-shirts and my euros as well. I've now skint so I'm having to have a rather cheap night in. Not my idea of a good Saturday night but its got to be done so...  So, the plan is that I drive over to Liverpool on Monday.  I'll be using airport car parking for the week so I'll leave my car there.  I then fly off to Madrid where I'll get a taxi into the center to Michele's apartment. As for after that I have no idea what so ever.  I know I'll be visiting a few museums, and hopefully the Bernabau stadium too.  As for the rest of this weekend. Well, not a lot I don't think.   Later.

      So basically I was playing with the themes for postnuke and something went wrong.  I edited the database so that the site used the default theme again but its still fucked so i must have done something else too but i've not found what yet. That leads me into blogger.  I wasn't even thinking about using blogger but i noticed the botton on my google bar and so i fired it up and i'll fill the viod for the time being.  Oh yeah, making it w3c compatible was fun too.  i don't even know what i bothered but i did so enjoy on all browers!

      Yesterday I received a letter in the post. It was from a company called "Register EU" and they were warning me that my domain was about to expire and that if I didn't do something now then I would lose my domain and blar blar blar.  Lets just set a few things right from the start.  1) I own my domain.  2) I pay just over £6 a year to keep it offically registered. 3) I know the registrar agent I use. (It isn't registereu.com)  So to see this letter in the post, looking like a fucking invoice demanding 60 fucking quid for 2 years registration! (thats a good 5x that I already pay)  I know how this scam works, who doesn't. They perform whois queries on the web. Find out the name and address of domain owners, send them a letter when their domain is almost up for renual and see if they can con money out of them.  If I could get the low life scum that started the trend then I'd rip his fucking tits off!  That said, I sent of the details to the BBC TV program "Watch Dog" and hopefully they can do something.  Have a good bank holiday weekend all.  Jay.

      Once again tonight I've had the privilege of watching a good friend of mine, Ian Norgate perform as fist Adam (of Adam and Eve fame) and then Noah in the  urlLink Mossley amateur Dramatic  production of "Children of Eden". It was a superb performance and I really did enjoy it. I was fortunate enough to see him play as Pike in a remake of two "Dad's Army" episodes and this was even better.  So, as an early claim to fame for when he makes it to Hollywood. I was there and I know him personally!!   Later all.  Jay

      Six minutes past three on that tragic day. The pain and the trauma won't go away. Crushed as I was in that terrible pen. Dead bodies around me; one as young as ten.   I was big and strong, so I scrapped and I fought  To save my own life; well that's what I thought.  Because inside I'm dead and it cuts like a knife  That ninety-six died and I have a life.    I did what I had to; I had three kids you see. I couldn't die; it couldn't be me.  If I had died that day I never would have seen  My Ma's last seven years: My dear old queen.    Ninety-six souls haunt my dreams.  The nightmares won't stop; that's what it seems  I wake up sweating, shivering and shouting out loud  "There's ninety-six dead in that bloody crowd!"    I feel anger, I feel hatred, I feel guilt, I feel shame.  Ninety-six souls tell me I'm not to blame.  So why do I wake up screaming and crying  Seeing the faces of young people dying?    Ninety-six souls come to meet me each night  Taking me back to that terrible sight.  "They're to blame: Duckenfield and Murray  We'll get justice one day. We're in no hurry."    I should have died that day: I know that's a fact.  With the ninety-six souls I've made a pact.  "When my days are up and my judgement awaits  I'll meet you all in heaven at the Bill Shankly Gates."    Peter Etherington.   R.I.P THE 96   JUSTICE FOR ALL.   YNWA   The above poem was written by Peter Etherington, a survivor of April the 15th.

       So Scum won the FA cup again. It's a shame as Millwall would have been great winners. So we have to put up with the smug bastards once again for another 12 months. Still, they've been shit this season!!   Went to the chestnut centre as I said I was doing. It was great! I love the otters and I think C prefered the Owls. Especially the big white one. (Snowy)  Luke has gone of to Llandudno with Adam, Junior and Rob but I can't be arsed going so I'm just chilling out here.   I've got new contact lenses. They are the ones you wear continuously and at the moment I can't see shit. They are dead cloudy so I think I'll have a sleep and see if that clears them up.

      It's all go at the moment.   Tomorrow I think I'm going to the  urlLink  Chestnut centre  with Colette. I have a job to do in the morning so I don't actually know what time we are going. Anything beats watching Man Utd in the FA Cup final. I just home Millwall win!  As for the rest of the weekend, I don't think I'm doing anything. I need to save a little bit of cash for the coming weekends.  Next weekend I'm going back to Windermere to V's birthday bash. I think more of the Milton crew are going and hopefully others too. It should be great fun! I've taken the Friday off and with the bank holiday Monday it'll be a 4 day weekend! YAY!!   Then, the weekend after that I'm off to Wales for a week with the rest of Milton for the much anticipated holiday. It's going to be great. There are 14 of us going and we will all be watching England play France in their opening game.  urlLink   I just can't wait! The hose by the way has an indoor pool, a pool table, a private beach, 300 arces of land... It's just perfect!  Anyway, I'll write more as and when it happens.  Jay.

      Last night I went Ice skating with Pete. I've not been for some time and my feet were killing me!!  urlLink   I didn't fall over though and I'll be a hockey player in now time! I think we will be going every week from now on so it shouldn't take me that long to get good on the ice! (Still, it'll take me some time to get to Petes level) The only downside is that the closest rink is in Blackburn so its a bit of a way but its all good fun in the end so...

       Update: Pictures now availible  urlLink here.     Howdy all.  So this weekend I went up to Lake Windermere with some of the Milton crew.  I set off on Friday evening with Colette and we arrived at around 8. The drive was great and we did it with out getting lost and that's good given the directions said "take a right" with no indication as to which road to take a right on to. Anyway. As we neared the end of a very long twisting road we saw V and Colin so we knew we had made it. From there we headed over to the pub for a catch up as we hadn't seen each other for about a month or so. Paul and Mike arrived short after. (They got lost, -5 points). After the pub we headed back to the house where Paul and Colin cooked Fajitas and Tacos and we passed out soon after that.  We were up early on Saturday, Colin and V have to check out houses in Lancaster so we were left to our own devices.  Colette, Paul and Mike took the ferry over to Bowness and I drove around the south of the lake so that we had a car on the other side. Once we finally met up again we went and had a great full English breakfast in a local cafe. With nothing really to do we walked back to the lake side and decided to hire out a rowing boat for the hour. Colette and I started off the rowing and we were rather awesome at it if I do was so myself. The rowed all the way to the newly named "Isle of Milton" in the middle of Windermere where we swapped seats and let Paul and Mike row. I have to way that if there played football like the row then Milton would be looking for two new players. Shocking! Mike blames the length of his legs while Paul firmly believes he is Olympic class. Either way they sucked. :p   Once we had finished the rowing we got back in the car and headed over to the town of Windermere its self. We stay there long enough for a cuppa and then met Luke in Kendal. We had a couple of pints in the Globe inn and Colin and V joined us half way through. After a pit stop of sorts at Woolworths (where we got a new football!!!) and at Morrisons we headed back for our BBQ.  As the sun was still strong we played some Frisbee and football on the side of the lake and even went for a swim. (It was a bit too cold to mention, and Colin lost his modesty, but I'll leave it at that). Afterwards Paul prepared the food and I had the easy job of cooking it and it was all rather good. Much beer was drank including the rather special "Kronenburg Premier Cru" which, I have to say was damn good, but at £2 a bottle, a tad expensive. We crashed out to a film, 2Fast2Furious and then just fell asleep one by one.   Sunday started early and Luke did a great job cooking the sausages we hadn't eaten from the BBQ the night before. We sat on the jetty behind Colin's house watching the world float by and feeding some of the evil ducks. Then we went for a walk around the east side of the lake and after climbing something akin to Everest we found a nice field to play more Frisbee and Football.  Once we were all suitably sun burnt we heading back and after some sandwich we all headed home.   It was a most superb weekend and thankfully its all happening a week on Friday! I can't wait!  Jay.  P.S. Many thanks to Colin for letting us stay.  P.P.S. Pictures will come soon then I get some of V and Mike.

      It was up to windermere again this past weekend for 4 days of bliss. I picked up Collette and V on Friday morning and we made our way through the wind and the rain to arrive at Colin's at around 3pm. Paul and Mike were already there and Luke arrived not long afterwards. We had a Spag Bol for dinner and they we all got changed and went out into Bowness for a fair bit of drinking and dancing. Fortunately we found a mini bus as soon as we left and the half an hours driver around the lake cost £35 which isn't too bad.   The next day Tweedle arrived and we heading into Bowness again for breakfast and our new favorite cafe and then as the weather still wasn't good we went and watched "The day after tomorrow" at a cinema in Ambleside. When we left the cinema it was bright sunshine and most surreal! We had a nice BBQ that evening basking in the wonderful sun.   We started Sunday with Sausages for breakfast and then we went playing footy whilst Colin took is just arrived Mum, Dad and Sister (and the girls too) into Ambleside for sight seeing and what not. They came back and we had another BBQ (and kick off some free loading twats from Colin's land).   Monday as pretty much the same. We had the same breakfast and again went playing footy on the side of the lake. The the long drive home. I did around 400 miles this weekend. Not bad on one tank of petrol.  Photo's as always are availible  urlLink here .  Later peeps.

      Well the flight is delayed by 40 mins. I'm not too bothered about this, I just hope that someone is still there to pick me up at the airport.If not then I'm not to sure what I'll do. I guess I'll think of something as and when I have to. I'll get some sleep on the plain as for it not to be such a worry but seeing as the only phone number I have is one for the company it's self, I'm not sure what I'll do.  Anyhoo, I'll trying to stay upbeat. This is by far the most stressful part of going away like this. I'll be fine and I'll relax when I get to my appartment and I can chill out.  It'd be nice if the airport had wap too but I guess thats too much to ask for. I've got a weak signal but nothing strong enought to use and so I can't check my mail or anything.  As for t'internet in Tenerife. I'll have to see if I have a phone line and if I can get one fitted so I can get ADSL over there and not be completly out of the loop.  We'll have net access at work for sure (it'd be impossible to do my job without it) but I would like a half decent connection at home too. I might have to wait a while but it shouldn't be a problem.  Oh, about the baggage. I was well over my allowed limit of 20kgs (my case weighed in at something like 38kgs and apparently you are only allowed to take 30kgs in one suitcase so Erickindly got me a holdall so I could move over some of the weight in to another bag.But that still left me way over the limit, just know spread over two bags. But he weighed my hand luggage and that was over too and he said I needed to move some of my contents over #to the suit cases. I explained that this was impossible as it was a laptop (the one I'm using now) and he said "Oh, thats not a problem then, laptops are exempt from hand luggage charges".  This still left we with 38-20=18x£4=£72 quids worth of excess to pay. He then farted around for a while until I think he got bored and until noone could be arsed openning the pay desk and so they just let me off the charge. (My laptop not counting as hand luggage cancilling out the rest of the luggage??? I think he just couldn't be arsed with it, but either way I've saved a fortune so all is good.  Jay.

      Well here I am again. Leaving on a jet plane to places unknown.  I'm off to start my new job and I guess life in Tenerife.  As usual with my jearneys, I start my first entry to this new log from a bar with a nice cold Bodingtons beers in my hand.  I'm feeling quite elated right now. I love the start of new adventures.  I've been most lucky too having had my baggage exess charge waivered due to owning a laptop. Crazy I know. May no traveller be without one.  I'll explain more when I get longer to write.  I'm as always sad to say good by to my family and friends. Mum, Luke, Eric, Abby and Simon came to wave me off. Mum cried, Luke sucked it in, Eric was a rock and Abby just went "Eww - Meow"I'm not sure how I went. I don't quite think the realisation of what I'm doing has sunken in yet. It's all been very quick in the makingand I still think I'm not totally aware of what is going on.  I will leave this log for the moment as I need to finish my beer and check up on my flight details.  Adios my friends.  Jay.
