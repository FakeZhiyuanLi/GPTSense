      Hey guys. I know I've already talked to some of you about this but if you're still in burque on the 26th you should come to Del Norte High School at 7 pm to watch us play volleyball. It will be just like old times. Unless of course you have never come to an Academy volleyball game. Then it won't be so much like old times but it would still be really nice to see you guys there. School stinks without you guys around. And not to be repetitive but I miss you guys soooooooo much. Glad to hear that college is going well for those of you who are already getting settled in and good luck to those of you who are still getting ready to go. Anyways, catch ya'll on the flip side. LATAS!

I met some kid from East Mountain High School and I thought of you...I asked him if he knew you and he said yes that he roomed with you for something or other...How is AJ?  Are you guys going to be able to live with each other for the next couple of months?  Anyways, just hadn't heard from you since you left and was thinking about you and missing you tons...Love always, Lynsey

       Hey guys! I just got into San Antonio TX (yea Texas!) and am at new school and I'm having so much fun already. My roommate is cool, but has anyone ever seen the Dell commercial where the two roommates and one is kinda preppie and energetic and the other is kinda gothic? Yea, that's sorta what it's like, but shes sweet neways and we randomly get along. I hope everyone's having fun at college or getting ready to go soon. Talk to yall later...Off to unpack all my crap.

      Hey there! I'm posting from the great state of Texas in the best city ever, DALLAS!!! Eeep! Hope y'all are doin' good back in New Mexico or wherever y'all are at now. Alright, enough Texas talk for now, even though I truly am starting to pick some of it up. I miss you guys so much and just wish that we could all be together again. College is fun though and i'm sure you guys will all enjoy it. My roommate is nice and my suite mates are awesome. Classes are hard  so far(I've only had two days) and I already have some homework. It is a lot different from AA, well at least SMU is different, so be ready for that. Anyways, hope to hear from you guys soon. Miss you all and love you tons!!! Texas rocks my socks! (I'm sure I'm going to get tons of comments from you guys on this post!)            Love always,      Karen

       ...a mentally deficient person with intelligence in the lowest measurable range; a stupid personâ€¢ word history: The development of pejorative senses of idiot occurred in ancient Greek, although the meaning "a mentally deficient person" is a more modern refinement. Greek idiotes, the source of idiot, is derived from idios, "private," and originally meant a private citizen in contrast to a public official. The use of idiotes was extended to other pairs of opposites such as layman/professional, layman/priest, common person/distinguished person, and unskilled worker/craftsman. A person of no special status, knowledge, or skill was idiotes, and the term became one of abuse.

        Something hilariously funny.... or maybe not... sent to me by a crass friend who shall remain nameless (outside of the crew).          I was pigging out on cheap, crappy Chinese food in a local dive--the kind of restaurant with '50s decor, those stupid wall radios at each booth that never work, but they keep them there to suck your quarters, anyway; naughahide red booths and low-level lighting that makes any food look good--when I had to avail myself of their frighteningly-dirty shitter. Oh, well. Live dangerously, die young, as they say. The saving grace, though, was that the men's washroom had the best graffitti around--colourful and crude. Imagine my chagrin when I entered the stall and looked forward to a good read to take my mind off of business of doing my business when I realized that the walls had been freshly painted. There was one graffitto, however, which I eagerly read, thankful for that small gift of entertainment. It said, "BLowjobs", followed by...my home telephone number. I woulda shit myself if I wasn't, in fact, already doing so.

       Hey, I guess I just wanted to finally have my own post instead of just commenting on other peoples.  Unfortunately, I don't have too much to say.  So I guess this is just kind of a general shout out and official first post for me.  Also, what is up with those random questions on the profile page?  Those sound like Tommy made them up =)

Later

P.S. i still can't get over how cool this will be.  Oh yeah and alex change the name of the page.  we should all put in well thought up alturnatives.

      I just wanted to say that I love all you guys and I'll miss you all.  Never forget the ways it used to be.  I know we're supposed to look back and laugh about the bad times and cry about the good ones being over, but lets laugh about it all.  I love you all and always will.  I know this is really cheezy but i had to get it off my chest.  You were all the best bunch of friends that I could have asked for and you will remain just that because I hope you will never stop being my friends cause I sure won't stop bieng yours.  Anyway enough with the sintemental crap.  Peace love and all that jazz.  Stay real and um ... uh... peace out!  P.S. to the boys: Humuhumunukunukuapua'a mazel      to the girls: don't ask

      Hey chicos! I am not to sure that I will be a very good blogger. I am sorta computer stupid. But, nonetheless, I am psyched about this idea Flo. I get pretty bummed thinking about you all leaving me for college. I mean what will I do if I have to listen to my dear class-of-05-friend talk about her boyfriend (or ex-boyfriend) from virgina all the time? By the way, speaking of "Tucker," he apparently wrote nikki a note about how "relationship wise" she gave him "a sip of the sacred fountain, and now he is thirsty because other water tastes bad." If anyone knows what I am supposed to say when a friend asks me what she should do about that, I'm all ears. Anyways, thanks for inviting me to blog with ya'll. Tommy keep up the poetry, you'll go far with that. Ali, HEEELLLLLOOOOOO, i'm glad your on. And Flo, I love you and keep in touch.

      She's gone away, but still they stay together. People call me crazy, crazy. My thoughts progress. I think about forever. My mind tells me maybe, maybe. I wish I could drive away to the sunset. Back to the day that we first met. Only believe the things that I wrote. I'll put it in a note, yeah. Cross my t's and dot my i's. Better say hello don't you dare say goodbye. I'll write sincerely yours and sign my name. P.S. I love you forever and today.

      So what's up peeps? I'm probably not as good at this as Flo but that's okay. So i guess this makes me number two on the list of bloggers right. That feels kind of wierd to type but oh well. This sounds like a sick way to keep in touch with stuff and it is also a lot more "professional"... yes? Well i hope this makes it out okay. Here goes. Catch you on the flip side. ZIP IT UP AND ZIP IT OUT!!!

      So i went through my email book that aol does automatically - and it seems that I don't correspond with many people online - so i need some help from all of you in the first batch of inviteeeeeeesss..... In the first group i emailed - ruska, cody, kelli, armand, tommy, ali, neswood, amber, and suelo. that's it. so that's sad, it's not that i don't like the other people! and i think people like jeff don't even use email. anyway... pass this site on.  p.s. - i can change the name of the site so it's not "flo-centered" haha. peace

      Body... No - there is no point to the name - it's a useless excercise to ask.  Leme tell you a little bit about what this is.  On this site, i can invite all of you (all of you because you won't read this unless i invite you, or perhaps if you invite others) to be a part of this little experience.  It seems at first as though I am the main blogger, and you all post comments, but you can join too.  I figure this is an awesome way to keep in touch because i'm sure that most of us won't have regular phone conversations over the next year. Please, Please, Please do this with me!  Even if you don't start until you go to school. The webspace is free - so we can upload pictures to share with each other and just write back and forth about our lives or what-have-you.  Talk soon, hopefully!
