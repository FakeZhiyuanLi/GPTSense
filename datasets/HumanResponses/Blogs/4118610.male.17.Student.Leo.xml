       urlLink    Since the Telepathic Tree is the greatest invention since the automobile, there isn't anything it can't do. I was thinking, what's the biggest problem facing people today? And since I am hiding in my bomb shelter with an AK47 and 3 years worth of supplies because of that new terror warning, the answer came easily: Terrorism! Thats right, the Telepathic Tree can help america in the field of national security! How it works is simple. Since it is telepathic, it can read minds. And since a terrorist thinks terrorist thoughts like "I hate america," "I hate jews" and "o my allah, that womans face is showing!", they should be easy to pick out. Of course, the Telepathic Tree isn't perfect, but I bet that woman was a bitch, so she had it coming anyways.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Move over Fido and Fluffy! The Telepathic Tree will replace all those obsolete pets. It will never run away, it wont die in your lifetime, and if it gets hit by the car, it will be fine. It will be a child's best friend, because it can tell how a person is feeling, and it is extremely intelligent. To sum it all up, the Telepathic Tree makes the perfect friend and companion. Unfortunately, as you may be able to see from this high tech computer simulation, there are still a few bugs to work out. But more funding will solve all those minor problems.  urlLink

      The other day, I had a genius idea that I know will make me rich. Don't even try to steal my wonderful idea because it is already patent pending. I call it "The Telepathic Tree." You see, it is not only a tree, it is telepathic. Unfortunately, the building and development process still need work. That is why I need the defense department or japanese investors to fund this awesome project. So if you are a japanese investor or a defense department official, get out your check book and gimme an email. If you wait, then the terrorists might get this idea first and take over the world!!! I have illustrated one of the trees many practical uses, and am working on more. It will be posted soon, as soon as I can figure out how to post a picture.

      Well, here it is, my first post. And if your reading it, you should probably go outside and do something useful. I'm not exactly sure why I have a blog, but the little infoturial was just so entrancing that I just had to sign up. Well I have been bored recently, so what the hell, I'll give it a try. First, an introduction. I'm a guy living in america, in the state massathingy. I don't like america, and my lifelong dream is to move to canada. My political orientation, as close as I can figure, is liberal with a strong libertarian streak. I believe that most people, when you get down to it, are evil. Especially Americans. If someone went around offering $10 million dollars to Americans if they beat their mother with a baseball bat, I bet most would do it. I believe people are too materialistic, and I also believe that the giant corporations with tremendous amounts of money own the government, and the government rules the people with fear. I'm also a secular jewish atheist vegetarian. Wow I'm weird. Well that's it for now. I guess now it's time to sit back and wait for a movie deal or something...
