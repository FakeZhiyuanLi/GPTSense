       Another Day has come and past, yet i did nothing! well, almost nothing. I went to warhammer and watched a movie, big woop!i want to do something fun!!! oh well. Well, i was SUPPOSED to go fishing tommorow with my uncle dave(not my real uncle, i just call him that, same with aunty sue) and This guy named goodlad(dave), but they got drunk and my mom said no. Well that stinks cause i wanted to go fishing!!!! but, we cant all win. Anyway, uncle dave is drunk, and aunty sue was kinda worried about him getting angry or something, so she called my mom and she(my mom) went up there. Now im all alone in the house, and its raining and thundering(and lighting) outside, which really sucks. Wait...yeh, ok. But i think im gonna go mess on the net some more then go watch Braveheart, so thanks for readin my nightly rant, and i'll see ya in the morning!

I guess it is a Baod day(i combined BAD and GOOD)last nite was fun, my friend joanne's friend's horse had its colt, (its gonna be joannes colt(a male horse),BTW)but it wouldnt stand up, so joannes went up there,then when my mom got home from work i told her, and we went up there, but it still wasnt up(it was born at 10:00am yesterday morning, and when we went up there it was about 8:30pm, so it wasnt very good that it wasnt standing up, so i biked up there, and my mom drove(i felt like a bikeride)and we came back down, then we were watching a movie and joannes said she was going back up there at 2(am), but my mom couldnt go, so i went with her at 2(am!). It was really fun(*cough*)but yeah, he got milk and stuff, so its all good. Just finished my breakfast at good, yummy, fries for breakfast.
