      Ok Im back now. I wanted to write more in my previous posts but I kept getting interrupted. We all know how that is. Anyway, the job situation sucks because of the government and thier fearless leader, George W. Bush. Im I the only one in this great nation or this big world who thinks this guy is a true nutcase? I honestly think that this guy is a grade A moron. On a lighter note, I am over at my friends place and his dad is one of the lucky few who have a 2004 Toyota Prius. I have got to be one of the luckiest 17 year olds because I get to drive this amazing car. But It aint mine, so thats all I get. I hope to get a job here in the near future so I can get my xB.  Anyway, Im getting tired so Ill go before i fall asleep at the keyboard. Peace. ~K-Evil  PS the second post had the worng time on it, disregard that.

      Hello, one and all, welcome to my blog page! Im your host, K-Evil and I would like to say one thing to all of you, this is my first blog and, if it sucks, well thats just tough now aint it! No one said you had to read it anyway. Just kidding ya'll. Well I guess I should tell you a little bit about myself. I live in Bradenton, FL and Im 17 years old (will be 18 in september). I am a major computer geek, especially when it comes to Macintosh, and by the way i posted this using my 12 in iBook. I am also a linux nut. And for those of you who don't know what linux is, and you know who are, is an open source code operating system that competes with Microsoft Windows, so to speak. I am also a big fan of the Scion xB. Well I would love to tell you more about myself but I must really get going. More on me tomorrow, hopefully. Peace out yall. ~K-Evil

      K-Evil back once again in this piece. As I said before I am a big fan of the Scion xB, and for those who are not familar with both Scion and the xB, go to http://www.scion.com and look for the xB. But anyway, Im trying to find a job, like most people, but I am having a hard time finding one. If anybody has any info on anyjobs in the Bradenton/Sarasota area, email me at k_evil1986@yahoo.com. I need to get a job so I can get my Scion. Anyway im out, Ill talk to ya later. Peace.

      School is once again in full swing and im not liking it one bit. But this is my last year of high school so I really cant complain too much about that. Anyway, Im back in school and still have nothing to do. My job search isnt doing much better. I wanna get my xB but with my job situation the way it is, its not gonna happen. It would be nice if this place I applied to called me back and said hey you got the job. That would be so nice. Anyway Im gonna go for now so Ill post something again when I get around to it. Peace
