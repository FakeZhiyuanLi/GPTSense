      ***whoops!  forgot to click on the "publish" button.***  now playing: urlLink taking back sunday - you're so last summer   i was sleeping for about the 5,800th time, when i was rudely awoken by the sounds of loud boisterious laughter.  like any sleep-deprived teenager would do, i buried myself in my nice comfy spider-man-covered pillow (hey! it's comfy, goddamit!), in hopes of muffling the audibility. it, of course, did not work.  after rubbing my bloodshot eyes, combing my unkempt hair with my hand, i walked(still half-asleep) to source of all this don't-let-eugene-sleep-since-he-stayed-up-all-night mayhem.  still yawning and rubbing my eyes to better adjust for discernment, i was suprisingly greeted by...my cousins.  so i thought to myself.   wait a minute, i distinctly remember barricading the house and installing the moat.  how did they...?  oh well.  so, cousins, eh?  that doesn't sound so bad. at least you're with family and it isn't some sick petaphile that broke into your house looking to get some.     yep.  shawn and allison are here.  my mom pointed out that shawn bears an uncanny resemblence to elijah woods.  now that i think of it, he does look like that weak pansy hobbit.

       yeah, i decided to blog-hop. so what, you commie?       i just realized classic xanga is garbage, and that blogger is a lot better. calm down, ryan, owen, and the rest of the elite blogging community. simma' da' na'. yes, i know all of you were on the verge of one your snoopy dances. i have a couple valid reasons for the blog-hopping madness.         yesterday, i finally got around to tinkering with my xanga's skin feature. so, i did some clickety-clicks here and there, and viola, nothing. you would think it was because of some minor mistake on my part, but for once in a lifetime IT WASN'T! apparently, i had to get premium to enjoy the xanga skin goodness, the sheek uploading capablities, et cetera. then what's the problem, you ask? premium is not free. (haha, you know where this is heading, doncha?) the price for premium ranges from $4-$100, depending on the subscription. just hearing the words "not" and "free" in the same sentence set off some sort of alarm or spider-sense, something in my very asian consciousness. man, that was almost as bad as hearing the words "lets get married." i obviously didn't want to pay to upgrade, so i decided to "jump ship" so to speak. as much as i love xanga, it just isn't worth paying for something that everyone should enjoy. i mean, c'mon, if your mom is being passed around so easily, why shouldn't xanga? damn, for a $100 i better damn well be immortalized. so, now we're back to my point: why should i? why should i pay for something as trivial as typing a few measely words onto a homepage, and only at a fraction of blogger's capabalities. a fraction of blogger's capabilities! oh gee, that sounds  so  much more appealing.   premium, pssh. i suggest you take that $100 and think about that, xanga.      so enjoy my new blog, 'cause if you don't...a good day to you, sir. oh yeah, please leave tips. i'm still learning html as i go.
