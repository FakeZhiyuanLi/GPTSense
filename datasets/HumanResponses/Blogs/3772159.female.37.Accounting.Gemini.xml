      Just a short note.&nbsp; I didn't realise until Amanda told me that you were having to register with blogger in order to put comments about my posts.&nbsp; I have fixed that now and the general public (ie you, my friends and family) are now able to comment on my posts without having to register.&nbsp;&nbsp; So please feel free to make comments, give advice, tell me to shut the hell up or whatever.&nbsp; I look forward to hearing from you.

        Aaaaaaaagggghhhhhhhhhh.&nbsp;&nbsp; I typed in a big long post and I lost it.&nbsp;   *Note to self* -: "Self, please remember to copy your post before you try and post it.&nbsp; Then you won't have to retype it all the time" :- *End of note to self* &nbsp;     Guess who just wasted 10 minutes checking to see if she had really lost that post.&nbsp; Yep its me, and guess what. I had.       &nbsp;   OK.&nbsp; Here we go again .    &nbsp;   &nbsp; Anyway.&nbsp; I didn't even have to go through two weeks feeling naked without an engagement rign on my finger.&nbsp; The excellent staff at Garden City Showcase Jewellers rang me 10 days after I ordered my wedding ring to let me know that it was ready.&nbsp; I was down there within an hour (surprise, surprise).  My wedding ring is absolutely gorgeous.&nbsp; It is made of 18ct gold (I am allergic to anything less pure) and is scalloped.&nbsp; It fits in perfectly with my engagement ring and the scalloping matches the ridges on the engagement ring where the diamonds sit.&nbsp; I am really surprised at how well it turned out as I had a lot of trouble visualising what it would look like from the drawing we saw.&nbsp; For the speedy service and the excellent craftsmanship this was money well spent.  I would recomment this jewellers to anyone in Perth who needs a custom-made ring.&nbsp; If you were to look at the rings together you would swear that they were made as a set.  The gift registry also took less than 2 weeks to get sorted once we had done all the horrible foot slogging around the shops.&nbsp; I took my list in, they entered it into the computer, making smaller items like cushions and ramekins into group gifts so that most gifts on our list are valued at around $30-$50.  We signed the stores copy of the list as soon as it was posted to us and took it in immediately (if I don't do things at once I tend to procrastinate and they never get done so it is important I act at the time).&nbsp; So our registry is now available at the information desk at Garden City for anyone who is interested.  We have announced our wedding date to most of the potential guests now.&nbsp; Well, Jim's mum has actually done an awful lot of the announcing for us. *grin*&nbsp; I told the footy club mob when Amanda and I were out for dinner with them last Friday and they all seem awfully excited.&nbsp; I just wish I could afford to invite everyone along.&nbsp; They are more than welcome to come to the church and watch the ceremony, but I just cannot afford to feed and water everybody unfortunately. *Insert sad smily here*  Next task is to get the invitations to Ireland completed, addressed and sent.&nbsp; Needs to be done ASAP just in case anyone actually wishes to travel here and join us in our nuptials.  And a meeting with the minister next Wednesday afternoon.&nbsp; Then we will have a time for the wedding and the ball will be rolling.&nbsp; And I can get the domestic invitations done (did I mention that if I leave it I will procrastinate and it will never get done?)  I will post about the invitation process another time.&nbsp; For now it is time I got back to the real life that keeps interfering with my computer time *insert evil wicked grin here*.  &nbsp;

      Ooops it's been a while.&nbsp; Funny how real life has a tendency to get in the way of a good story.  On the day we were supposed to go and have our wedding dress measurements taken, Carey was very unwell.&nbsp; She had a staph infection in her ear and sinusitis.&nbsp; So Amanda, Rebecca and I went down on our own.  We went upstairs and I showed Amanda the dresses that we had chosen.&nbsp; She loved mine but was not overly enthralled with the silver and white witchery dress that Carey had chosen.&nbsp; She was desperate for a purple dress.&nbsp; So I relented, especially as I had already told her that she did not have to have the same colour as Carey as long as her dress was in the same style, or she could have chosen the same colour but had a different style.&nbsp; She loved the style.  So my colours are now silver and purple.&nbsp; Her dress will have silver trimmings.&nbsp; Actually that was probably a pretty good colour for her to choose as I had already made the invitations to send to Belfast and they were silver card with purple paper, covered with tracing paper with gold hearts on it.  Rebecca is basically having a miniature of my white and silver dress.&nbsp; We are all having the same silver trimmings and we will all wear flat shoes.&nbsp;   The seamstress was excellent and the dresses will be ready a month before the wedding.&nbsp; We will go in then and try them on and she will do any needed alterations.&nbsp; Also she measured in inches and seeing as inches are bigger than centimetres, there are less of them and it made me feel a hell of a lot smaller.  Carey and I went down to get her measured up about a week later.&nbsp; She decided to have a purple dress as well, because she feels that it will look odd if her and Amanda are in different colours in the photos.&nbsp; Personally it wouldn't bother me, but she seems to be happy to wear exactly the same dress as Amanda, and so that is the way we are going now.  So on or before October 27th I will finally get to see my dress on me.&nbsp; I can't wait.&nbsp; Only 3 months until my dress is ready.

      These are either the best thing to ever happen to a bride or the biggest pain in the butt of the whole wedding process.  I haven't decided yet.  I will let you know when I do.  The concept is a brilliant idea.  I make a list of what I need and instead of receiving 15 toasters, 26 kettles, 89 dinnersets and a million glasses I get what I actually need for my home.  In reality though, we don't need an awful lot.  Since setting up home together we have gone out and bought almost everything essential for the home and most things we want as well.  And I feel uncomfortable asking people for things that I wouldn't normally bother about buying for myself like ornaments and stuff.  Sure, I like to receive them, I just don't like asking for them.  While we were at the shopping centre on Monday I went to the information desk and asked about their gift registry.  It is a free service and I even get cards to put in with the invitations telling people where to go to find out what goodies I would like.  At this stage, I am still thinking this is an absolutely brilliant idea.  What could be easier than to write out my wish-list and then just hope that someone buys what I write down?  So we come home Monday, we fill out the registration form, and we look at their suggested wish list and tick the items we think sound good.  Easy so far.  Tuesday, we go down to the shopping centre, do the ring stuff, grab a coffee, and then start to look around the shops.  Writing down stuff that looks like it could be useful.  Things we could live without but seeing as we have all the stuff we can't live without we have to be a little inventive.  First shop down, 2 pages of goodies, 2 hours gone.  Have a bite to eat and tackle the next department store.  Another 2 pages of goodies, another hour or so, and I am aching all over.  I think I mentioned on the rings post that I hate shopping.  The main reason for this is that after half an hour or so of standing or walking, I literally ache all over, I get a pain in my right groin, the ankle I broke almost 2 years ago swells up like a balloon, and the dislocatable knees ache like nothing on earth.  So I decide I am over the whole gift registry thing and we come home.  Wednesday, back down to the shopping centre, well we do have to sort out the ring thing after all.  First up lunch, then a couple of essentials for the computer, like printer cartridges and then we wander around the 180+ speciality stores that are at the shopping centre.  I am so over the whole list that I am having trouble working out why I would want anything let alone why I am choosing my own gifts.  And then I discover all the things I picked at the department store yesterday are actually a hell of a lot cheaper at the speciality stores.  Aaaaaaggggghhhhh, because I cannot in all good conscience let my guests pay $13 or more extra for items I have to cross items off my list and write them in again at the cheaper place and price.  Into K-mart to check what else we can put on the list that we havent already thought of.  I am so, so, so over the whole thing.  "Do we really have to get married?  Can't we just live in sin forever?" These thoughts fleetingly cross my mind, and then are dismissed.  It will all be worth it in the end.  Back to the information desk to ask for some more of the sheets that you write the gifts on so I can write the list out legibly.  And to check if I can put items on the list that I have not actually chosen a brand or colour for and would just appreciate receiving.  Sure, she says, just add them on at the end, with a heading that states that you don't want a particular brand or colour or anything.  And because the wedding isn't until November she tells me that I can just bring it in next week because we are not in any great hurry.  Home we go, relax for a couple of hours, then I compile the list and because I am writing smaller and neater I have managed to condense it from 6 pages to 3 pages.  Items range in value from $1.95 (though we do want 8 of that item) to $199.  We don't expect to receive the $199 wine rack but this is a wish list and we wish to have it.  In fact I would just be happy if everyone turned up and had a fantastic time.  So now I am going to go and take a couple more panadeine (I am living on these at the moment) and put my feet up and relax.  I would have an early night but I suffer insomnia and can't get to sleep anyway.  And if I was to fall asleep nice and early I would wake up too early and be a mess all day tomorrow.  I think I will have to go and get some of the essential oils Janine suggested to me on delphi and try them out for a good nights sleep tomorrow night.  And so endeth the gift registry saga.

      On Monday we rang my mum and Jims mum to see if they would like to come shopping with us and have lunch.  They both said yes so we picked my mum up as she lives over our way and met Jims mum at Garden City as she lives about 20km away in the opposite direction.  We got there and started looking at jewellery shops.  We started at Edments as that was who we had purchased my engagement ring from.  Another shop but that chain.  We went in and asked to look at wedding bands.  The girl did not seem to be awfully interested in serving us, and was not helpful at all when we realised that my engagement ring was an odd shape and we would need to have a ring custom made to fit with it.  (We tried a plain wedding band with it and it just looked ridiculous.)  They did not have any interesting mens bands there at all, only plain gold wedders and they were not at all cheap.  I think the cheapest was around $300 for a 9ct gold band.  We went to another 3 jewellers and although 2 had mens rings that interested Jim, we were having a problem finding anyone who could make my ring without it having to be sent out of the shop and to someone else.  This idea is not appealing to me as the more people handling the $1,800 ring the more likely it could get lost, stolen or damaged.  Ian Hill Jewellers could make me a ring onsite but I would have to wait 2 weeks until their jeweller got back from Bali before we could even look at a design or price range.  They had a quite nice mens ring and were the first jeweller that really showed any interest in us at all.  The girl there was incredibly helpful.  We decided to go to one more jewellers (I was just about over the whole ring hunting thing by then) and spotted Rosendorfs.  Now like Ian Hill, Rosendorfs is on the more pricy side of jewellers that you will find in a suburban shopping center.  This was immediately evident by the fact that we received immediate, good quality attention.  We looked at a large range of mens wedding bands and found a good 5 or 6 that looked really fantastic.  Then Mum spotted a two-tone gold band with a plaited rope design in the middle.  It was fantastic.  Jim tried it on and it just looked incredible.  So we got a card from the girl and then started talking about my ring.  She got a price range for my ring and said that it would cost about $385-$400 to make me a plain gold band in 18ct gold.  We went away to talk about it.  On Tuesday we decided to go and order both rings from Rosendorfs.  We had decided that Jim's was just perfect and we didnt want to spend too much time wandering around to millions of shops to find someone to make mine.  So we drive back to Garden City and go in and let Nicole know that we would like to order and pay for the rings.    Nicole got a crestfallen look on her face when we told her that we wished to order both rings.  Apparently after we left on Monday she had been told that the Rosendorfs policy was that they could only custom-make wedding bands to go with engagement rings purchased from them.  We decided to go ahead and order Jim's anyway (he has really small fingers and they don't have his size premade, it will take a month for the ring to be made in his size).  But this meant we were still going to have to look for my ring.  We had intended to go and do our gift registry list yesterday (can you see another post coming up?) so we didn't look at any more jewellery shops at the time.  We thought we were going to have to either go into the city or out to Maddington to get a ring made.  A lot of running around if you ask me.  Last night we went to Mum's to drop off one of the cats (another long story) and we were looking through her seniors discount directory and we noticed that the only jeweller we hadn't gone to in Garden City was the same brand as the one we thought we were going to have to go to in Maddington.  Could it be that they had a jeweller onsite there?  We decided to ring this morning and check.  We had to finish looking at items for the gift registry anyway so if possible we should try and get a ring at Garden City.  Jim rang Garden City Jewellers this morning and they said yes they had a jeweller onsite and all rings were made right there on the premises.  So for the third day in a row we headed over to Garden City.  (Have I ever mentioned that I really, really, really hate shopping and avoid shopping centres like the plague?)  We walked into the jewellers and I handed over my engagement ring to the girl on the counter who took it out back to show the jeweller.  She came back a moment later and asked if we would mind waiting while Erica (the jeweller) drew up a design or two for us to choose from.  We looked around the shop at the beautiful cuckoo clocks (hint, hint - if anyone feels like spending almost $500 on a wedding gift for us, we would love the cuckoo clock with the little people on it) and crystal ornaments.  After about 10 minutes, Carla (the assistant) came back out with two designs for us to look at and a price of $580 for either ring.  We were told that it would take about a month for the ring to be made up in 18ct gold.  We thanked her, got the quote written on a card and went to have lunch and discuss the matter.  After all, this price was a good $200 more than we had been quoted at Rosendorfs, but Rosendorfs only did that price if you purchased the original ring anyway.  After about 5 minutes discussion it was decided that unless we wanted to run around in circles looking at more and more jewellers that we should take this offer and run with it.  So we headed back to the jewellers (detouring on the way to add to the gift registry) and let them know that we would like to order the ring.  We were then asked which design we wished to have and how thick I would like the ring.  I had to hand over my engagement ring for the duration of the making of the wedding ring and asked how long it would be before I could have it back.  Carla said she would check with Erica how long she would need the engagement ring for.  She came back with the fantastic news that the ring would only take 2 weeks to be made.  So we paid for the ring, left my engagement ring (I feel totally naked now) and went off to do the gift registry thing.  Cross another item off the list.  Rings are ordered and paid for.

      Another great thing we discovered at the bridal fairs, was a place called Formalwear Express.  They come to your home at a time that suits you.  They bring a range of suits, shirts, ties etc.  They measure the guys up, co-ordinate the clothes and then take a small deposit.  A couple of days before the wedding, they return with the outfits you have chosen and 2 days after the wedding they come back and pick them up again.  Very handy.  John and Carey came over for dinner last night and then we waited for Malcolm from Formalwear Express to turn up.  His wife, Rebecca, rang in the afternoon to check on the boys neck sizes so they knew what size shirts to bring.  He was then running about 10 minutes late and rang to let us know at about 10 to 7.  (He was due at 7pm.)  This gave us a chance to let him know that he should use the rear door to the house as this is the main entryway and give precise directions to our home.  (It is not always easy to find if you don't know where you are going.)  When Malcolm arrived, he came in, introduced himself and measured the guys necks (which was a good thing because Jim had underestimated the sizes of both his and Johns necks, his by one inch and John's by 4 inches) and waists so he knew what size trousers to bring in.  He then verified that Jim was interested in looking at a long coat (among others), asked what colours the bridal party would be wearing and if we would like to co-ordinate the boys with the girls.  He went back out to his van and came in with a rack of shirts, jackets, and ties.  And a pair of trousers each for the guys to try on.  He handed each of the boys their trousers and then chose a pleated shirt that appeared to me to be way over the top.  He said it was best to start out with the fanciest shirt and then go down rather than the other way around.  The boys vanished, one into the office and one into the reading room to change into the shirt and trousers, John appeared first looking relatively smart in his shirt and pants but with a pot belly showing *grin*.  Jim made his entrance a moment later, but his buttons were out of alignment and I had to make a small adjustment. (Jim had a stroke as a child and has no use of his left arm and only 16% vision, he manages pretty well most of the time but there are occasions when he needs a helping hand.)  While the boys were gone Carey and I had had a look at the silver vests which had been brought in and picked a stunning silver paisley vest. Malcolm handed each of the boys a vest and they put them on, he then handed them a long jacket each and they put that on too.  I never realised these fellas would scrub up this well.  They looked gorgeous.  Now it was time to choose a style of tie.  Jim did not wish to wear a cravat as he did not wish "to look as if I am selling fried chicken".  So the choice came down to a bow-tie or a halflength tie.  He tried two different colours of the ties but they just did not look right on him.  Then he put on the bow-tie.  It looked outstanding.  Small hitch - bowties are only supplied in black.  Not a problem - between the black suit, white shirt and silver vest the whole outfit just melded perfectly.  Another little hitch - he only had one bowtie with him, so John tried the halflength tie in black just to check the colour.  Problem solved - John suited the half tie perfectly.  The boys will be dressed identically apart from ties.  This means I will be able to tell who I am marrying when I walk down the aisle. *wicked grin*  So the whole outfit looks perfect, but our wedding is being held 3 days before the start of summer here in Western Australia.  What does the outfit look like sans the jacket?  John looks fantastic it all sits really well.  Unfortunately we don't have the same luck with Jim.  As he is a funny shape due to the stroke (one really skinny arm, sorry honey) the shirt doesn't sit quite right.  Possible solution - Carey's mum could adjust a shirt so that it does sit right.  Possible problem - we are only hiring the suits so you can't just adjust someone elses shirt.  Possible solution - can we buy a shirt from them rather than hire it?  Malcolm will get back to us today and let us know, otherwise Jim and I went out and priced the shirts today and we can buy one off the rack for $75 which Careys mum can adjust.  So if the shirt to buy from them is more than about $60 we will just go buy one from the shop.  By the way did I say the shirts were too fancy?  Not at all, once they are on with the vest and tie with or without the jacket they are just great.  So we are now well on the way to having this thing organised.  Next post, the great wedding ring search.

      Next step in the process was finding the wedding dress.  Being a larger lady limits your options a little, unless you are willing to pay a fortune to have a dress made or drive 50km to a store that stocks larger sizes.  However I lucked out at a bridal fair that I attended with Jim, John and Carey.  Not only did we find 2 dress shops that stock large wedding dresses but we got a free magazine when we entered the venue (you would want to for $13 a person admission).  When we got home and were flicking through the magazine, I saw this medieval type dress that just caught my eye.   The medieval style of dresses are IMNSHO very classy on a larger lady.  Carey went home and managed to find 2 websites of shops in Perth that carry medieval type dresses.  One of them was the company that made the dress in the ad.  First thing I did after looking at both sites was to go into my delphi forums and post the links and ask my friends for their honest opinions.  I got lots of great opinions on the dresses that were shown on the sites.  The urls for the sites are http://www.intocamelot.com.au and http://www.medievalcreations.com.au .    After looking at both I was much more drawn to the Into Camelot site, but decided to give both stores a looksee and see if perhaps the pictures on the second site didn't do justice to the clothes they had available.    So on a Saturday we took off down to Fremantle and looked at both stores.  Problem 1 -  we could not find Medieval Creations at the address they had on the webpage.  Rang yellow pages and found out they had a second store at the E-shed Markets.  Wandered around the markets and eventually found the store. Problem 2 - The dresses in the store only went to a 22 and most of the dresses only went as large as a 16.  There were no signs advising if they would make clothes to size. Problem 3 - The assistant in the store chose to ignore us totally.  If I go into a store, quite often I like to be left alone to browse, however if I am looking at your wedding dresses then I would expect you to come and at least offer to help me.  She sat there and read her newspaper, probably hoping that the large woman who she could not possible sell a dress to would disappear.  We spent a good 5-10 minutes in the shop being ignored and then left.  Went to the other end of the markets and grabbed some lunch before heading for Into Camelot which was at the other end of Fremantle.  We parked and immediately found Into Camelot.  Just wandering around the displays outside the store we found the dress Rebecca wanted for her flowergirl dress and many other dresses that would be suitable for any of us for day or evening wear.  We already knew we were on a winner.  Wedding dresses were upstairs so we left the boys downstairs and walked up the stairs to have a look.  At the top of the stairs I saw a gorgeous dress, but the price tag of $1500 made me change my mind just a little.  There were a good 4-6 racks of wedding dresses in cream and white.  I picked a dress in the Agincourt style (see the link on the intocamelot website) in a cream and gold.  It was absolutely gorgeous.  I chose the cream and gold as this is not my first marriage and I thought that the white may be a little overboard.  Now it was time to choose a colour for the bridesmaids.  First let me say that the store has many many gorgeous colours for bridesmaids dresses.  However as the dresses have chiffon sleeves or lace sleeves, it is a bit of a battle to match the colours to the dress.  I was quite happy with the effects but Carey is the one who has to wear the dress and she was not real impressed that the colours did not match.  Then there it was, Carey found a gorgeous silver dress with white chiffon sleeves, (check out the fairytale link on the site) it was absolutely perfect and would suit both her and Amanda.  I fell in love with it at first sight.  But would silver and white go with gold and cream?  The very helpful assistant then pulled out the same dress I had been looking at in cream and gold, but now it was in white and silver.  It was even more perfect than the cream and gold dress, contrasted beautifully with the girls dresses, and just blew me away.  Ok, now we had picked out colours and styles for all of the dresses.  One small hitch, we need all of the dresses custom made, not a problem at all, Into Camelot specialises in making dresses.  We now have an appointment with the seamstress on the 11th of July.  She will get started on Carey, Amanda and my dresses almost straight away, but we will leave Beckys until closer to the wedding just in case she has a growth spurt.

      Of course the hardest thing about arranging a wedding is choosing who to have as Matron-of-honour, Best man and bridesmaids etc.  This was relatively easy for me at least.  The person I am closest to in the whole world is my brothers wife Carey.  She is friendly and supportive and just a joy to be around.  She is also incredibly excited about the wedding so is a natural choice for Matron-of-honour.  My daughter Amanda is bridesmaid.  She is very excited about the wedding too.  Rebecca was offered the choice of either being a bridesmaid or flowergirl.  She chose flowergirl.  I am not sure how much trouble Jim had picking his Best Man.  I think it was relatively easy for him too.  He asked John to be Best Man.  John and Carey are around here at least twice a week and we spend that much time at their place too.  If we need anything done John comes running.  Once again a natural choice.  Joel was invited to be a part of the bridal party too.  He declined saying "Thats gay" and "I will wear boardshorts and a singlet to the wedding.  Suits are gay".  Gay is Joels word of the month (or should that be decade).  Nathan was also invited to be a part of the wedding and the honeymoon but he has declined.  Due to his fathers influence I am not his favourite person in the world and he decided if it meant he had to be around me then he did not want to know about it.  I cannot wait for the day when he realises I love him no matter what.  And that I will always be here for him.  It distressed me a lot when he refused to come, but I did my bit, I invited him, offered to pay for everything for him, and if he does not want to come then I have done my best.  We think we will ask Lil and Michelle to drive the wedding cars.  We are using Johns and my cars and we trust them to drive them.  Plus we are quite close to them and do not really want members of the family having to drive and missing out on the experience.

      Now we move up to June 2004, finally we decide on a date for our weddding, we had been looking at March 2005 but having been on a business trip to Brisbane in May, we had decided that the Gold Coast was the place to have our honeymoon, and that we should spoil the children and take them along.  (They had been getting a bit narky about us going away without them all the time and besides the whole time we did the touristy bit we were thinking how much they would enjoy it.)  Now with the girls still at school, we had a bit of a dilemma, if we got married in March the girls would miss out on valuable time at school, Rebecca in her first year of high school and Amanda on that all vital year 11 stuff.  When would be the best time (without school holiday loading on airfares and accommodation) to take the children to the Gold Coast.  Weighing it all up we decided that they could afford to miss the last week or two of this years schooling.  So that meant a honeymoon date of mid-December.  Well it would be a good idea to get married a couple of weeks earlier so we had time to settle into married life before going on this holiday.  My brother had been married in November 2003 and had a lovely reception at Paddy Hannans at Burswood Resort here in Perth, so we decided we would like to have our reception there too.  We asked if John and Carey would mind and they said that they would be flattered that we considered them to have good taste.  We set a tentative date of 20th November 2004.  Then we went along to Paddy Hannan's to book the room.  Uhoh, the room is booked out on the 20th, we could have either the 13th or the 27th.  For some reason the 27th had been sitting at the back of my mind for a while so that is the date we chose.  So we quickly booked the room, didn't want there to be a chance in the world of losing this date.  Next decision, church wedding or garden wedding.  I had always wanted a church wedding but as my first two husbands were not in the slightest bit religious or even spiritual this had not happened.  Plus I had now discovered what true love is.  Jim is the only one for me and I want to proclaim this before God and man.  So it was now a choice of which religion, I have been baptised Catholic and Jim is Church of Ireland, neither of us were regular church-goers, so it was decided to have an Anglican wedding.  Now how to find a Minister?  I know two Anglican Ministers.  So I rang Peter Stanley who was Minister in Mukinbudin when I lived there.  He gave me the numbers of 4 ministers in our local area who he highly recommended.  We tried to call the first minister on the list for almost a week with no success at all, so we moved on to the next minister.  Anita George answered the phone the first time we called and invited us to come down and have a look at the 2 churches in her parish and choose which one we would like to be married in.  She also said that she would be happy for Peter to either assist her with the Marriage Ceremony or even to perform it himself in her church.  This was incredibly sweet of her.  She asked us to call her back when we had decided which Church we would like.  We went to St Augustine's almost immediately and decided that if the inside was as nice as the outside we would have our wedding there.  This was around 5pm on a Friday night.  So we attended the service on Sunday morning in order to have a look at the inside of the church.  It was even more lovely than the outside.  The parishioners were incredibly friendly and the service was lovely (we lucked out and there was a baptism performed that morning so we also got to see a gorgeous little baby).  So, on the Monday, Jim rang Anita and asked her if it would be possible to get married at St Augustine's on November 27th.  She checked her diary and said that this was possible and so we booked the church.  We have an appointment with her on the 4th of August to organise this wedding.  Things are really starting to move now.

      Jim and I have been seeing each other since May 2003.  At first I resisted his efforts to become a couple, as I was gun-shy from two abusive relationships and a deep slide into depression due to emotional and psychological abuse in the second marriage.  However his sweet nature and true gentlemanliness (is that even a word?) won me over in the end and at the beginning of July 2003 I agreed to give this fledgling relationship a chance.  We live in Perth, Western Australia and one of the first things Jim did was to take me on a holiday to Melbourne for a week.  We had a ball.  Lots of shopping, a little football (did I mention we are both big Australian Rules Football fans?) and an awful   lot of sightseeing.  On our return we continued dating, mainly going to events at the football club (GO YOU MIGHTY DEMONS!!!!!) and out for dinner and various things.  In September we considered moving in together.  Our plan was to start living together around Christmas time, but events occurred which made it a case where we started to live together immediately.  The house I had been living in was way too small for what we needed so we rented a bigger house.  I had been living alone up until June when my daughter Rebecca (11) decided to move back home from her fathers house.  All of a sudden we were a household of 3.  In around November 2003, my son Joel (16) decided to move back in with me from his fathers house, our household was expanding rapidly.  Then Amanda (14) decided to spend the Christmas school holidays with us, our 3 bedroom house was showing major indicators of being way too small for us.  March 2004 saw Amanda (who had by now turned 15) decide that it was more pertinent for her to live with us fulltime so it was time to find yet another larger house.  We still had one outstanding child Nathan (11) and it was decided that we needed a house that would accomodate all that were already living at home plus a room for Nathan just in case.  We tried to get finance to buy a home but without fudging the figures there was just no way we could be considered for finance, and if we did fudge the figures there was a good chance that we would not be able to afford the repayments.  So back to the rental market we went.  We looked at 3 or 4 houses but most of the houses in the rental sphere were too small for our rapidly growing family.  Then the property manager (thanks Colleen) that had found us our original rental told us of a large house that she had on the market, we thought that perhaps the rent was a little exorbitant but decided to look anyway.  Colleen showed me through and I rang Jim at work and told him that we just had to have this house, it is massively huge.  5 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, study, massive lounge and dining area.  He told me if I was so in love with it to immediately put in an application to rent the property.  I did this and when Jim saw it 3 days later he fell in love too.  In the meantime, Jim had proposed to me and we decided to get engaged at Christmas time.  We announced our engagement to family and friends on the 19th of December 2003 and had a lovely party at Jim's mothers house on 22nd January 2004.  The guest list for this party is essentially the guest list we will be working on for the wedding.
