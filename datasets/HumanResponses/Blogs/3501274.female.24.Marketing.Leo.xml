      cant believe the amt of work to be completed today is so much... almost buay tahan liao... thank God i slept last nite at 10pm... have enough mental energy to deal with the amount of work... had a good night's rest, then again, woke up twice half way thru my sleep...   recovered from my flu! Thank God! felt nauseous again... cos i drank 3-in-1 coffee which my dear mum made for me, but i fast for breakfast this morning, gonna get it from her tonight when i get home for not eating breakfast... well, its out of concern that she nags at me...  hmm, somehow learned to appreciate people who point out my errors more these days, when my md point out my errors or scolds us, i learned to see things from her point of view, and what makes her do that, instead of being sad that i kenna scolded early in the morning...

      First of all, Thank God, my fever is gone! It was gone on Friday afternoon.   Aiyo, saturday went for some diamond training at Mandarin Hotel... Diamonds are getting rare, they actually use machines twice a man's height juz to mine a diamond which is the size of a grape.   Wooo, imagine, God searches for us in the same manner as well... Indeed, we are precious to God. Thank God the training ended at 4pm, then i can walk quick quick to Nexus... Went in for service at 4+ think they were singing first praise song...   Had dmm after service, at a cafe in OG... Was chased out when they close at 9.30 and we had to go Macdonald...

       5 SENSATIONS now...    1.  Tired  zzz - been like that the whole day, cos i slept at 1am last nite.    2.  Leg Ache  - walked  a lot . been walking for  4 hours  had a mini round island expedition. took half day leave today.   1st stop: Kallang Sector - collect my pocket pc. I was told that old battery was bloated, sigh, I charged overnight. WILL NEVER DO SO AGAIN. Almost got lost at kallang sector. Was searching for the toshiba building around for more than 20 minutes... Half way through my journey I prayed 'papa, bring me there quick' then I found the 'promised land' within short time. THANK GOD! When I got there, suddenly found the aircon so cooling, the first time I went there, found it super cold as I was wearing bermudas.  2nd stop: KK hospital to sign as a surety for Hannah. she's going into nursing, signing a bond with KK.   3rd stop: Ang Mo Kio - had arranged to meet Pearline at 5pm to pass her the key to Rix's house, as she had cg there. THANK GOD i called her at 4.30, she told me her cg was cancelled.   4th stop: Plaza Singapura  (Shopping Spree)  bought contact lens case (3 colours: purple, transparent, turquoise). Hand cream and comestic brush at guardian. then went to buy ear piece for my Sony Ericsson handphone. (I walked from PS to Bras Basah)  5th stop: Bras Basah - went to buy a note book for my sheep, so that she can copy sermon notes and cg teachings. (Walked from Bras Basah to City Hall to take train)  6th stop: Heeren - meet my other sheep for dinner. she wanted to exchange a smaller t-shirt and bought a T-shirt at 37 degrees, promised to wear it together with her tml... washed it just now, hope it dries fast enough.   tat was some travelling, right?   3. Backache - due to too much walking, i guess. i was wearing a pair of ultra flat slippers...  4. Thankful - for 3 things, first two are mentioned in my mini round island expedition. the 3rd one is that i just received an email from MOE requesting for my education documents!!! yippie, i am one step closer to my aim *read yesterday's blog*   5. last but not least and most important  fulfilled - done a few things to bless people today!!! :)

      applied to be a teacher few days back on MOE website... i think the reason why i want to be a teacher would be the impact that i can make on younger lives... imagine them growing to be better, students bad at studies thanking you for helping them improve when their grades get better... (penny for your thoughts?) partly also cos i'm thinking of using teaching as a church planting platform...   monday going to register for the NIE proficiency test, but got auditors coming to my company leh... hmmm, shall think of ways to go knock on time... juz now smsed my manager, what can i prepare tomorrow in advance for monday's audit... think she muz be wondering, how come i always sms her at unearthly hours... yesterday smsed her about my increment amount...  mmm, cg today was a great one... we had canned cocktail dessert... *yum yum* and evelyn made potato cake... got cheese and ham one somemore... have been having this craving to cook for people... shall get my craving satisfied soon and real soon... anyway, dezhan was late, and he didnt know he had to lead games, we went to praise and worship straight... after which, amy, who didnt read my email, went fridge to take out the holy communion elements... i looked at her and said, 'thought holy communion was supposed to be after teaching?' evelyn had stomachache after the praise and worship and also during the teaching... so, i led holy communion on her behalf... oh well... me... made two blunders while leading them in prayer... instead of saying 'i am sorry, god' i said 'sorry i am god' and they laughed... the second blunder 'lord, we thank u that u are the lord of ur life' instead of 'lord, we thank u that u are the lord of our lives' sigh... blur like anything ah...  enjoyed the bus journey with my sheep just now... talked about many things... she was saying she fears getting sad when seeing people die... then i told her, the important thing is not to get used to it, but to handle it correctly, when u get used, it means that your heart gets hardened... think it struck some biblical truth in her...  sunday meeting my primary school classmates... wow... just now saw some of their pictures in friendster... so different... hee... this saturday can also see my primary school maths teacher... *anticipating and looking forward to the gathering*

      Tight Lips  Do you tend to play it safe? Hedge your bets? Keep a stiff upper lip when it comes to sensitive matters? Nothing wrong with that — don't your friends tend to confide in you more than others? You're honest and trustworthy, and you logically think things out in order to come to a rational, smart conclusion.  Your mouth doesn't get you into trouble too much, and you can be choosy when it comes to when, where, and with whom you open up. There's a simple elegance to your quiet ways that allows you to stay in control of situations and, in the end, hold all of the right cards. After all, a little mystery makes everything more interesting

      full of thoughts right now... juz received some highlighting from my boss this morning... been at my job for 2 years, along the way, made many mistakes, was i a fool to repeat mistakes? was i not concentrating on my job which resulted in work that were at times erroneous... changing my attitude towards my job? or just that i have no apitude for my job at all... throughout the two years i have been here, there has been no end to checking figures, from the hopefulness that i had in the begining (during my probation) till now, it has become a state of hopelessness. have this feeling of giving up on my job now...

          Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not disappoint us, beacuse God had poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.        Foot prints in the sand        ... ... He noticed that it happened at the very lowest and saddest times in his life. This really bothered him and he question the Lord about it. 'Lord, you said that once I decided to follow you, you'd walk with me all the way. But I have noticed that during the most troublesome times in my life there is only one set of footprints. I don't understand why when I needed you the most you would leave me.'    The Lord replied, 'My precious, precious child, I love you and I would never leave you. During your times of trial and suffering, when you see only one set of footprints in the sand, it was then that I carried you.'

      how true it is, joy does not depend on circumstances, but on Jesus, was pondering over more than one thing in my life, but i remained joyful. cos, my hope and joy and strength is found it God, dont think i would have made it this far if i were to be without God. *especially in my job. well, although there are always stones in our paths, always bear in mind that God has designed my path with my BEST interests in mind, He is forever loving and faithful to me! no matter what i do, "nothing u can do to make Him love you more, nothing that you've done would make him close the door" - lyrics taken from So you would come by Hillsongs.  Two songs that have been playing in my mind the past few days:  Jesus Loves Me  Jesus loves me this I know For the Bible tells me so Little ones to Him belong They are weak but He is strong  Yes Jesus loves me Yes Jesus loves me Yes Jesus loves me For the Bible tells me so   Because He Lives  God gave His son They called Him Jesus He came to love, heal and forgive He gave His life To buy my pardon And empty grave was there to prove my Saviour lives  And because He lives I can face tomorrow Because He lives All fear is gone Because I know, I know He holds the future  And life is worth than living Just because He lives

      hee, as the title suggests, 24 years ago, I came to this earth... 10 months before that, God knitted me together in my mother's womb... And His grace is still working in my life...  So many things that I want to Thank God for: 1. The air that I breath - Everyday I wake up I breathe another breath of God's mercy  2. My mama - for the loving care she dispenses -  got a photo of us at my work desk     3. My papa - for he has given his best to the family  Thanks to him for the yang yu zhi en     4. My kor kors - although we used to fight (bite them) when I was young, we are like frenz nowadays... keep disturbing each other *winks  5. My job - I believe that I am not working in my company by chance  6. My friends - primary, secondary, poly, uni  they have been in my life, all for a purpose! Gotta lead them to God!     7. My church friends - so surprised that "French Fry" called me just now to wish me happy birthday, so priviledged to have "mouse" as fren, shared few secrets with her, "Eeyore and DZ"  always "entertained"  with their jokes, for many many more people in my unit.  8. My shepherd and sheep -"meow" is a good shepherd, while Sherry contributes cold air. Although they always  stumble  me with their brand of lameness.   The chance to serve God in His church is indeed a precious one. Thank God for His grace, love, faithfulness, providence.    No Greater Love    You loved me, when I was so unlovely   You sought me when I was lost   You showed me how much you really love me   When you bought me at the highest cost      There's no greater love than this (x2)   That a friend would give his life for a friend.      There's no higher sacrifice,   That a man would give his life      You have paid a precious price for me.
