      id like to apologize to amanda, my mom is being damn gay and will not let me go to vv...! soo f-ing mad...sorry amanda i love you lol. since amanda was kind enough to write about me i will now write about her...  Oakster the great- you are one of the coolest girls i know. she doesnt care what anyone thinks about her, and can always make me laugh, no matter what. (her double chin helps too) haha...no matter what kind of stuff she is going through, she will always let you tell her your problems first...even if its only "what should i wear today?"...she is always happy to help you with anything, and is a really good listener...anyone to have her as a friend is damn lucky! i can guarantee that even if your mom just died or something, she could make you laugh so hard your in tears (good tears). she always puts a lot of effort into everything she does...like when she makes KD...my pudding beat it for sure...but the KD was still alright...haha...amanda and i were friends back in Nam...(i dono if thats how you spell it)...yes, but back in our "punk" days, we had some damn good times...its good to have you back amanda...i missed you(tear) haha...so to let you all know, IF amanda is your friend...your damn lucky n dont forget that...

      this is me...wanting to die.  today was the most horrible day of my life...i dont have any funny quotes...no funny things happened...at all.  my teachers are like teaming up on me...i swear...so i hope they die...all of you.  i have nothing to ramble on about today...and nothing else...cept maybe a couple poems...they suck...but im gonna write them.  .she hides behind her matted hair her twisted hands, her jaded stare she walks against the chilling wind wrapping herself in love and sin she licks her lips and tastes the tears sprung of salt and distant fears she rests among the blooming weeds mumbling prayers on dirty knees a child born of myd and pain she prays for the sobbing, virgin rain.  -----  she sits and cries, through you she dies. and you just laugh it off and turn away. cant believe youd do that, just turn your back and, pretend theres nothing in your way  breaking and falling, shes breaking and falling, now shes fallen to her knees. crying and calling, shes crying and calling, you just turn around and leave.  she lies in bed, words shoot through her head, of past promises made by you. she cant figure out why, youd just let her die, thought she meant so much more to you.  shes breaking, shes realling breaking, holding on...but not too well. her heart is bleeding, tired of needing, an explanation for this hell.  if things were different, she can see it, all her fantasies coming true. but shes left broken, no words are spoken, trembling, shes scared of you.  losing control, shes losing control, afraid to search for something more. your posession, shes your posession, inside shes cloing off her doors.  much love.the confused. amanda c.

      this is my life...ending.  my science has seriously taken me so long...and i really wanna ramble on about something but i dont know what to say...im all out of words...that must be a first...  me and amanda are practicing our british/nerd talk so IF she goes to bermuda...she can join them all in their ways.  oh yes i must add...im sick of all you stuck up people that are supposed to be more mature then us "little immature" grade 9s...honestly...when you walk by someones chair and "accidentily" kick it...its not an insult. it makes you look like a retard who cant walk. and when you look at us when we walk by, what do you think your doing? killing us? it doesnt hurt me in any way. it actually makes me laugh. cause your making me realized how immature and sad your life really is. honestly. who takes time out of their lives to glare at people and walk out of their way to hit their chair? who do you think is more immature here? age doesnt matter, its not my fault i was born 2 years after you...like sorry my parents didnt bang that early. and like i dont get why you even hate me? honestly...i have never even talked to you in my entire life. and i didnt even know you existed until i could like sense you glaring at me. and i swear if you ever say one thing to me...i will fight you. im not scared. and you might win, i dont know or care. but seriously you bug me so much. and i hope you know who you are. i would say who but i dont even know your name. some of you "older more mature" people have to really grow up and think about whos being more mature in this situation. a lot of your peers dont act like this. and a lot of my older friends dont either. your "supposed" to be setting an expample for us arent you? and so far your just showing me what NOT to be. so thanks i guess. cause now i know how to NOT act around other people. im sorry if i dont live up to your "cool" standards. but maybe thats not how i want to be. maybe id rather have good friends then be the bitchiest person...but hey...maybe thats just me. you might like your "status" in the school...but think about it. do you have friends you can turn to when something happens and know theyll be there for you?...just think about that one...even tho you probably dont read this...i hope everyone can comprehend the fact that the next person who calls me immature or anyone of my friends that just cause of our age. be prepared to back it up. cause yah we like to have fun, but we sure as hell dont go around giving dirty looks to innocent people. so grow up or leave.  much love. (to my friends. and only them.) amanda c.

      woah third blog of the day...im on a roll...well this one is actually just dedicated to amanda oakley...here you go man...  listen...no matter what i have gone through...you have always been there...and those months when we stopped talking...they were hell for me and by december...i didnt even know why it ended...back then i was just to blind to see what an amazing person you are...and what a great friend you can be. your the most important person to me and i care about you more then life itself. to me your not just a friend...your like the air i breathe...and without you i couldnt live. no matter what people say about me your always there 100 percent...and you know ill be there for you aswell. whenever we hang out i seriously laugh so hard...and i cant do that with anyone else. your one of the only people who understands the real me...and knows who i really am. with you...im totally myself...and i can laugh about the gayest things...even if im just laughing at the sound of my laugh...youll be right there laughing aswell. no matter if im in the worst mood or if someone died you could still make me laugh to the point of wetting myself. a friendship cant just be based on laughing...to me a lot is on trust...and i trust you with anything...i can tell you anything and know that it will be kept hidden forever. since grade 7 i have told you anything and everything, and still, no one knows...and that shows me a lot. amanda you deserve so much more then you have recieved and how people have treated you...but i guess people dont realize what you have till its gone...when ive already lost you...and im not about to do it again. every friendship has their fights...and we already got through ours. and i dont think we need another one...do you?yah...didnt think so lol. listen amanda...no matter what happens and what people throw our way...i will ALWAYS be here for you...and thats no joke...i have never cared about a friendship this much...and losing you just would tear me apart inside. if you ever need someone to talk to...someone to listen...or just someone to make you laugh...im here...and thats the most truthful thing that i have ever said...dont ever forget this amanda...cause it will never change...  much love. to my best friend that i have. amanda o.

      after mine and amandas many conversations about love and all that junk i finally realized how you can tell if you love someone...(be careful this is exetremely corny)...  1. when you hug them...you get shivers. 2. when you think about them...you get a nervous feeling inside. 3. when your not with them for a long period of time you feel empty. 4. if they died...words would be unexplainable. 5. when you think about life without them...there really isnt one...  listen people...if you love someone...tell them...cause it might be your last chance. theres only like 6 people i would say it to...but not all of them know it...but they all deserve to know...no matter how cheezy this sounds...every single one of you know that what im saying is the total truth...nothing bad will come out of telling someone you love them...  much love, amanda c.

      school sucks...i wanna stay at home forever.  well today was actually pretty funny i couldnt stop laughing in first period...at all. seriously...oh god...emily knows why...haha poor guy.  french sucked...obviously...and gym was alright we had swimming and me and amanda obviously made it fun...baha oh my lol.  i really wanna see dawn of the dead...i heard its really scary...like never sleep again or close your eyes scary...frik.  sorry people but i have to say this...the things that bug me the most are when friends stab each other in the back...like if your gonna be my friend then dont do that...honestly...or when they act like a different person around other people. grow up. frik. if you have to change yourself...meaning that your not being the real you...then get away from me...or be yourself. and also...when people say stuff about people that they know nothing about. if you have an opinion...GREAT! but i dont need to hear it. cause im sorry...but i could care less...unless your my friend then dont say it...cause it makes no difference what so ever on my life. and if your gonna say stuff to someone that i like...or that are my friends...thats bad about me. go ahead. but your being so immature...honestly your in highschool...there is no need for all that crap...cause i have never done anything to you...and if i have then resolve it with me not with people that i care the most about. thats just plain retarted people. i hope you got this little paragraph through your dumbass head...because its really not that hard to grasp. unless your just to stuck up, cocky, and arrogant to get this through your narrow minded head. if you are one of these people im talking about...you dont deserve to live...honestly...live your life having fun...and spending time with people you love...dont try to make me or anyone the center of your little world you call a life. cause really thats no way to live it, and if you do make it like that, then it shows people who you really are...and trust me...it isnt a good thing...your just making yourself look immature. and think about this...if your willing to give people dirty looks, and/or talk about them behind their backs...you could do the same thing to anyone...and how do you think that makes people feel?...obviously they arent going to trust you, or be there for you, cause you could be the same stuck up snobby little bitch that you are to me and other people...to them. so people...i hope you read this and actually understood what im trying to say. cause you might not think its important...but i do...so next time you think about saying crap about me...come to me with it to my face...cause im ready to handle whatever it is you wanna say...and if anyone one of you try to wreck something that i have with friendships or relationships...i will fix it for good...because im sick of all of the crap thats being said about my friends...and me. its pathetic...honestly.   much love(to the people i care about, and they know who they are) amanda c.

      hey there...  today...april 5th. is the day that kurt cobain died...not april 8th...he was found then people...  when the police found him...he still had the shoutgun pointing to his chin...and on a nearby counter this suicide note was found...it was written in red ink and adressed to Love and the couples then 19 month old daughter Frances Bean.  To Boddah Speaking from the tongue of an experienced simpletion who obviously would rather be an emascluated, infantile complain-ee. This note should be pretty easy to understand. All the warnings from the punk rock 101 courses over the years, since my first introduction to the, shall we say, ethics involved with independence and the embracement of your community has proven to be very true . I haven't felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music along with reading and writing for too many years now. I feel guilty beyond words about about these things. For example when we're backstage and the lights go out and the manic roar of the crowd begins, it doesn't affect me the way in which it did for Freddy Mercury, who seemed to love, relish in the love and adoration from the crowd, which is something I totally admire and envy. The fact is, I can't fool you, any one of you. It simply isn't fair to you or me. The worst crime I can think of would be to rip people off by faking it and pretending as if I'm having 100% fun. Sometimes I feel as if I should have a punch-in time clock before I walk out on stage . I've tried everything within my power to appreciate it (and I do, God believe me I do, but it's not enough). I appreciate the fact that I and we have affected and entertained a lot of people. I must be one of those narcissists who only appreciate things when they're gone. I'm too sensitive. I need to be slightly numb in order to regain the enthusiasm I once had as a child. On our last 3 tours, I've had a much better appreciation for all the people I've known personally and as fans of our music, but I still can't get over the frustration, the guilt and empathy I have for everyone. There's good in all of us and I think I simply love people too much, so much that it makes me feel too fucking sad. The sad little sensitive, unappreciative, Pisces, Jesus man. Why don't you just enjoy it? I dont know! I have a goddess of a wife who sweats ambition and empathy and a daughter who reminds me too much of what I used to be , full of love and joy , kissing every person she meets because everyone is good and will do her no harm. And that terrifies me to the point where I can barely function. I can't stand the thought of Frances becoming the miserable, self-destructive, death rocker that I've become. I have it good, very good, and I'm grateful, but since the age of seven, I've become hateful towards all humans in general. Only because it seems so easy for people to get along and have empathy. Only because I love and feel sorry for people too much I guess. Thank you all from the pit of my burning, nauseous stomach for your letters and concern during the past years. I'm too much of an erratic, moody, baby! I don't have the passion anymore, and so remember, it's better to burn out then to fade away. Peace, Love, Empathy Kurt Cobain Frances and courtney, I'll be at your altar. Pleas keep going Courtney, for Frances. For her life, which will be so much happier without me. I LOVE YOU...I LOVE YOU!.  kurt...your an inspiration to so many teenagers today...you know are a well known artist and person...you gave a whole new meaning to the word grunge...and music itself...  i wish i could give you more then this stupid blog...but i dedicate it to you...  you deserved better then this world anyways...  R.I.P...we will never forget you.  much love. amanda c.

      yees...  Silence builds an awful wreckage of a girl It feeds on loneliness and creates a void Gray shadows haunt and torment and torture A teenager is stricken and destroyed  There is no sound of laughter or happiness here The little one has thrown in the towel today Somber, melancholy moods decay the soul It is futile to hope and dream and pray  Emptiness builds a home in this woman In this girl, this child where hollows have bred A deepening sea of nowhereness consumes And eats away at every connecting thread  Confusion feeds like a savage inside her, Leaving nothing considered worthy remains Destined to walk through life less ordinary Alone, exiled, different and disdained.  --------------------------------------  I held the knife so close to my heart. Like a foolish child I sat and I cried, Didn't realize what I had done, what I had tried. Tears mixed with blood, falling slowly to the ground. Covered in blood, pulled myself up, in tears scribed:  "To those who don't care, to those who can't see, Never Give up always thrive to be free." Didn't know how many people would later cry. "Tried to be free, yet I see this isn't the way."  Friend at the door, ran as fast as she could. Too weak to say I'm sorry, otherwise I would. In tears, looked at the blue sad day. When you come and see this pool of blood and me, This isn't the way my life was meant to be.   --------------------------------------------  Why does the thought of death The feeling of ending this life The torture, the pain, the hurt The discomfort I cause, Why does it feel so right?  But the thought of the pain The mechanics, the method The hows and wherefores.. Why is that so beyond me, my abilities, My confidence?  I know I would be better dead All I care for is others All I do is hurt others All I want to do is leave others To their lives away from me  Is my inability from caring? Knowing the final act of hurt The final ability to screw others To give those who truly care A pain even I haven't done before?  But they would recover And they could see it was done Maybe not consciously, but truly For the best for them And therefore the best for me.  Is it fear that stops me? The inability to take the pain I couldn't inflict on myself The yellow man I am, The quitter, never finishing the Job  So I carry on to conceal the feelings Trying to do all I can for all And still I hurt and give pain Cause confusion wherever I go That is why I pray to die.   ----------------------------------  She remembers it all, All the people who had said They cared, but did they really?  She remembers it all, The sound of laughter and How happy she'd been, but was she really?  She remembers it all, His arms around her and He said "I love you," but did he really?  She remembers it all, The pain she'd felt when he left, How her heart ached, but was it really?  She remembers it all, The feeling of being so alone, The feeling no one cared, but did they really?  But now they'll remember her, Staring at the knife in her hand How easy to slit her wrists, but will she really?   ------------------------------------------------  She Paints inside her soul Visions we cannot see Swallowed up whole In a world we cannot know She dreams, Madness she alone knows She paints A not so pretty picture.  A child a sacrifice to some unknown God atonement for sins  She never commited She wars Inside a child who should Of been allowed to wear childhood  her eyes Stare So young to be so far away I reach out Try and touch your fear Madness dances across her soul She paints A not so pretty Picture.   ----------------------------  well i had nothing special to blog about...so i wrote some of my poems down for you people to read...hope you like them...mmmhmmm  well cya later.  much love. amanda c.

      whats with all the freaking fights this week..can people just not be friends? seriously. when you get in fights with people you can really tell who your real friends are...and the past couple of months have showed me a lot of good and bad in people. its really anomalous that you think you know who someone is and they turn out to be a completely diverse person. i guess it really shows you that you cant judge someone by what you have heard...you really have to get to know them. why some people change for others ill never know. i guess its just a part of growing up and learning...and you have to live to learn. but are they really living? i mean of course...your breathing...but think about it. you live each day being "you". sometimes it is the real you...it really depends on the persons capability of individuality. but if your living your life pretending to be something your not...your not really living. cause no one will ever get to know the true you. and do you really want that? sure we all like to be admired by our friends and peers. but if its fake, then whats the point? its not making you a better person. so what is it doing? its funny how i rant on about all of this, when really, its just common sense. be yourself. i mean thats what everyone has been telling us our entire lives...but maybe who we think we are, isnt the truth. maybe were not conspicuous to the eye. were just another blurred face in the crowd...nothing special. would it kill you to be different? right now everyone is trying a new style, but if everyones doing that...then its not original? so what is there left to do. maybe this is just me...being retarted. again...but think about it...really think about it. everyone now thinks they have their own style or trademark...but were basically the same. we all have our groups. and when you look at our groups. we all dress the same...or basically the same. were nothing special. and is that good or bad? to most...its a security blanket. and they like to be behind the scenes. it blocks them from the lime light. but others, dare to be different. they like to be the opposite of the trend. and make their own. to me...that is the way to live. whether people say im a poser or not. just explain to me this...how am i poser? what am i posing. what i wear, how i act, what i do, thats me...and nothing else. if people dont like it...then that is totally cool...do i say crap about you? no...i dont. people have different opinions and different personalites. which means that people wont always like what you do. but do you classify that as right? maybe the "right" or the "cool" thing, isnt always the best. so you get a couple glares in the hallway from anonymous people...whos being the better person in that situation? atleast your not just another face in the crowd or the little whisper in the scream. dare to be different...whats the worst that could happen.

      its all the same. nothings ever gonna change...so why should i try to change fate...  i was like thinking...(yea i know me thinking...shut up.) just about death n stuff...and we could like die...anyday...and you would never get a chance to say goodbye to some people...its kindof scary. most people are truly scared of death. but i dont get why you should be. everyone has different beliefs about what happens when you die...and mine...it would be better then me living...  i figure heaven is whatever you want it to be...so it would be everything i ever loved and wanted the most...i think that would give me a better life then this one. i wouldnt have to deal with peoples pointless, mindless, crap.  but just knowing that you could die tomorrow...and not be able to say goodbye...i want my friends to know. i love you more then anything...tara.teo.woods.allie.liz.and my best.oakley.your what keeps me going every single day. and if i died tomorrow. my goodbyes would go to you.  somedays i might not be in the greatest mood. or show you that i truly do care about you. but i do. i am so glad to have friends like you guys. youve all become a huge part of me...and without that...i wouldnt be who i am now.  oakley.you showed me a sense of individuality. and how to be myself. i look up to you. i can trust you with anything. and i know you will always be there...you always put my problems infront of yours...even if its just so gay...just never forget...you are and always will be my best friend...no one is more important then you.  i really wish i could say i love you to a guy...and him say it back...but hey. i would tell you all who i really do truly honestly love. but they dont know it...and im not sure if i want them to...but if it was meant to be...itll happen right? well in heaven it could.  this blog is pretty pointless...but still. my space. my time. my writing...so f you all if you dont like it.  yes. well thats it. thats what i was thinking about...so i will go now...  much love. amanda c.

      whats up.  tonight was cool. i went to the red chevron to watch a few bands. hacketts new band is wicked...matt and kyle are hot. kyle-drummer. gave me a shout out going something like this...  "id just like to announce me and amanda clegg had sex, im not sure where she is in the crowd, everyone give a hand for amanda, im the father of her baby!"  yes i was quite proud...and red...and everyone thought he was serious which made it so much cooler. then i ate pixie sticks with marc, and sniffed the odd one...and i gave a guy my email (actually 2) and i found out after the one had a boyfriend...damn he was gorgeous...but it was funny nonetheless.  i got to see matt, jason and sean, who i never see anymore. it was wicked...  rest of the night sucked...except tony took us to mcdonalds for ice cream. i love him. i love him dearly.  me and teo talked to really hot guys from this one band...they were 17 and 18 and they lived in toronto...they were so hot...wow...  i think thats it for my night...  much love.  amanda c.

      its hard to find something blog worthy...when i have a lot of like...thoughts you could say...i dont know.  throughout your life, your looking for many things. like happiness, a good job, and someone to love. some people believe in the whole fate thing, and others, well...they dont. its hard to live life, hoping that everyday you could find that special someone. but how do you know? how do you tell? just knowing, that your future husband or wife could be standing next to you...is a kind of scary thing. most people i know, are striving for happiness. many people find happiness from different things. me, i find it through love. how do you know if your too young for love? is there such thing even? to me, there isnt. it doesnt matter how old you are, where you live, or whatever else. if you love a person, none of that should matter.   some people are afraid of love. they could be scared of commitment, or even just what loving someone does to you. and what responsibilites you have to take on. but i dont think it should be something you hide...its an important thing. and hard to find. i believe that you can love more then one person in your life, but there is only one person that you are truly meant to be with. and when you find them. youll just know...  i dont really believe in just suddenly one day you meet mr. perfect...its something that you have to look for, and find. it doesnt just fall onto your fingertips...we are the architects of our fate...is that something to be scared of?

      -------- it captures me to think what she would do if she had her way to toss her hair and casually offer a stare and a secret, she likes her candy. badly she behaves....hoards the harmless innuendos and sets them on fire dancing in the flame...dares it to burn her, the pain doesn't hurt her. teases and pulls and draws them out only to sting them for thinking it could be so she doesn't want you, but take her hand and step onto the carousel...she's feeling the itch hiding in the corner with a catlike grin, don't let her know she's getting close she's gotten too good at this now to be consumed, she kids herself. too many fairytales have built a mythical charisma that will float into your ears like the sweet nightingale melody she dreamt about you and only you baby. she sized you up long ago....you're only a man until you take her hand. foolish hubris always the demise, handsomely packaged...but she's looking to fall. fleeting imagery....she's much smarter than that, but if she had her way. ---------  so uh yeah, im so bored, sitting here listening to some real emo music...i love it.  i have nothing to talk about...i just have some...poems? sure...but im not taking time to write them...just that one up there.  well yeah...boring blog.  much love,  amanda c.

      Dear Allie Brown,  You never said stuff about me eh? listen, i have friends, who tell me things. and i hear everything you say. im sorry if i dont fit your standards allie. but i think its better to be yourself then to be a copy. what i am everyday, thats me. sorry i dont want to blend in...unlike some people. and im a poser huh? just tell me exactly how i am a poser...what am i posing? and you "mrs pro snowboarder", i bet you cant even do a 180 of a jump. i think your getting people who change for other people, and people who are themselves mixed up. i am my own person allie. its a lot more then you can say for yourself. and yes allie, i used to like you, a lot. but seriously, you have no right talking shit about your friends, your the one who needs to grow up. or get some sense knocked into you. friends dont talk about friends...and your telling me i need to grow up? i never threw a football at you. i dont carry that in my back pocket thanks. i was laughing cause it hit you. i would have IF we were friends anyways. and you know that. seriously allie if you want to blog about how much you hate me, just like i am doing...then come to me tomorrow...face to face...we will see how much you can say there. and i am dead serious. if you wanna talk about me behind my back. im not going to take it like a little wimp. i wish me and amanda never fixed yours and woods' friendship. you dont deserve her. amanda woods is an amazing person, and she doesnt need you...she could have had alex. but she was being a good friend and didnt take him...she should have him right now...honestly allie, if i could hate you more i really would, but its physically impossible to do so. i really wish you would go back to grade 8 allie, but obviously, your not welcome there either.  Sincerely, Amanda Clegg.

      hey. everyone want to hear a story? no? whats that? well im telling you anyways.  so i walked home with rob, and he walked me to the forest behind loony lizard. he turned the other way. and i decided that walking through the forest would be so much quicker and more efficient. so i start my journey and everything is going great. theres a bit of mud, but not to much and a clear path...then...after about...30 minutes? sure. the path ended, i took a wrong turn and ended up in the middle of know where, not knowing where i was or anything. i tried to get out and i stepped into this mud pit...no exaggerations the mud went just below my waist. i was completely stuck and then finally, got out, but oh NO! my shoes were stuck so i had to get so muddy and grab them out. i walked for about 15 minutes in this mud trying to walk on big logs, then i fell off and landed ass first in the mud...wahoo...finally i got out to a semi road. and them i saw sleemans. i ended up by sleemans. oh man. so i turned around and yes, once again went into a forest, i got completely lost and it started to rain. i sat and cried for about..10 minutes then went on my way. finally i found clairfields and walked home. i have never been so dirty...in my entire life...  its rather funny thinking about it...it sure is a journey to remember...  much love, amanda c.  words of wisdom-shortcuts suck.  -your halo is slipping down to choke you-

      i just have a few things on my mind...that ive decided im going to share.  first off i just dont get it. why so many people are making such a big deal about hating people. honestly, throughout your life, there will be a ton of people who you hate, and who you like. you cant help it. some people are better to you then others. but it doesnt mean that their not better to someone else. yes, sure, i do hate some people, but i do have reasons. and there is probably only like 2...3 maybe. who i truly hate with a passion. its just very weird how all of a sudden there are so many fights. i mean, whats the point.? everyone seemed so happy before. and now, every single person just has to have some sort of an opinion on something. yeah i know we all have opinions, but do they all have to be shared? in 10 years, you wont remember this pointless bullshit. youll remember the good times with your friends, but if your too caught up in the gossip of who hates who, and who is "hardcore" and who isnt. then what will there be to remember. you will just look back and wish that you did something better with your highschool years, and made them the best possible. so honestly people, just grow up and get over yourselves. and im not saying that im not included in this group of people. because i know i have said stuff to people and all that, but its pointless. and to anyone ive ever been a bitch to, im sorry. and most likely, you didnt deserve it. i think sometimes, we get to caught up in stuff that doesnt really matter. and sure at that time, it seems like the most important thing in the world, but before you open your mouth and say stuff you might regret, think about it. really think about it. is it worth it? is a fight worth losing your friends? or whatever the case may be? i dono. maybe i am the only person thinking like this, or no one cares. but i do. im not going to let any pointless fights get in the way of who my friends are. i think over the years we have all changed a lot, but i think before, those werent our real friends. we didnt really have a choice of who we hung out with, their wasnt much selection. but now, in highschool, there are so many different groups of people you can be a part of. and ultimately, its your choice. but i think by now, you should know who your real friends are. there the people who are always there for you, no matter what. and dont blow things out of proportion. who believe in you, and help you with problems. it doesnt matter how long you've known them, a good friend, is a good friend. and all you people who judge me and my friends, you dont know us. just because you have known me since kindergarten or whenever, doesnt mean that you know even the littlest bit about me. i have changed so much, and the only people who know me, are my friends. we all have our judgements on people, but a lot of the time we dont even know them. so right here, right now, im done judging, im done being retarted and being a bitch...its over...and so pointless.  so once again, to anyone i have ever been a bitch to, judged, or whatever, im sorry. were all important to someone, and you cant please everyone. so of course, we will always have people we dont care for much. but it doesnt give you the right to say stuff about them and judge them unfairly. i think its time for a lot of us to grow up and get our head out of are asses. pretend everyday is your last. take risks. have fun. make the best of it. think more about having fun, then the latest gossip. who knows where it will get you.  anyways, thats just my thought.  much love, amanda c.  -words hurt-

      this is from along came polly/blurty..it made me think..  It's not about what happened in the past,or what you think might happen in the future...it's about the ride,for Christ's sakes There's no point in going through all of this crap if you're not going to enjoy the ride And you know what?when you least expect it,something better's gonna happen..something better than you had even planned on.  ive blogged like..3 times today..wahoo.

      Once on a yellow piece of paper with green lines he wrote a poem And he called it "chops" because that was the name of his dog And thats what it was all about And his teacher gave him an A and a gold star And his mother hung it on the kitchen door and he read it to his aunts That was the year Father Tracy took all the kids to the zoo And he let them sing on the bus And his little sister was born with tiny toenails and no hair And his mother and father kissed a lot And the girl around the corner sent him a Valentine signed with a row of X's And he had to ask his father what the X's meant And his father always tucked him in bed at night And was always there to do it  Once on a piece of paper with blue lines he wrote a poem And he called it "Autumn" because that was the name of the season And thats what it was all about And his teacher gave him an A and asked him to write more clearly And his mother never hung it on the Kitchen door because of its new paint And the kids told him that Father Tracy smoked cigars And left butts on the pews And sometimes they would burn holes That was the year his sister got glasses with thick lenses and black frames And the girl around the corner laughed when he asked her to go see Santa Claus And the kids told him why His mother and father kissed a lot And his father never tucked him in bed at night And his father got mad when he cried for him to do it  Once on a paper torn from his notebook he wrote a poem And he called it "Innocence: A Question" because that was the question about his girl And thats what it was all about And his professor gave him an A and a strange steady look And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door because he never showed her That was the year Father Tracy died And he forgot how the end of the Apostles Creed went And he caught his sister making out on the back porch And his mother and father never kisses or even talked And the girl around the corner wore too much makeup That made him cough when he kissed her but he kisses her anyway because that was the thing to do And at three A.M he tucked himself into bed his father snoring soundly  Thats why on the back of a brown paper bag, he tried another poem, and he called it "Absolutely Nothing" ; because thats what it was really all about. And he gave himself an A, and a slash on each damned wrist, And he hung it on the bathroom door - because this time he didnt think he could reach the kitchen  i dont know why i posted that. i got if from blurty. and i thought it was so sad...wow.

      You said, "Tonight is a wonderful night to die." I asked you, "How you could tell?" You told me to look at the sky.. "Look at all those stars.. Look at how god damn ugly the stars are.."  just another boring sunday...doing absolutely nothing...wahoo.  everyones so happy in relationships..or..whatever you want to call them..its pretty sweet..maybe even sweeter if i were one of these people..  doesnt it suck letting your heart out to be crushed..so badly that is hurts to breathe. yeah? thought so. especially when you think you have a chance, and you get totally fucked over...but hey...s happens right? sure...of course. i keep telling myself im over it, but i keep replaying that moment, that one perfect moment, over and over in my mind. and id just like to know, what the hell did i do wrong? what makes her so much better then me? you dont know how much i want this.  alright enough about that...i cant change it now.

      hey. i just got back from seeing dodgeball. very good movie. i suggest you go see it, cheepskates..lol.  i would have laughed a lot more but my mind is all like thinking..yes i know out of school and im thinking. wow eh?. but no. about love. and all that junk. and i just realized how much i really am afraid of getting hurt. and i used to hide that, but going out with guys..but really. that just made it way worse. even all my friends think that i always have a guy. and its true. i always do. whether i like them or not. i make myself think i do. there are very few guys i have actually..truly liked..usually its been crushed. quite fast i might add. kindof stinks. anywho, i just think that relationships and love are a waste of time unless it is real. seriously, who wants to be in a relationship and get crushed..? yea thats what i thought. like why not just be really good friends with them? that way you wont lose them..it makes so much sense doesnt it? anyways, this is weird for me to say all this, because usually im looking for a guy, or they find me. but im sick of it. always being involved..yes, i like it, but i hate the ending, and all good things come to an end. so until, i find someone, that makes me truly happy, and i actually wanna be with them. im single..it feels so weird to say that. ah...haha wow. i guess right now, holding myself back is the best thing to do..this way..i cant get hurt..and no one can hurt me. right?...

      hey i just watched the movie how to deal..and wow. it made me think about relationships and all that junk. and how so many people want to be in one. or have the perfect one. and usually im one of those people too. but i was thinking, whats the point? usually in the end your barely friends, if that...and its so stupid. because how can you go from going out with someone, to never talking to them? sure, yes, i want the "perfect" relationship. but if we are never going to talk again, then whats the point? in the end of the movie they were together, and all happy...and thats awesome. but sometimes it doesnt last all the time. and when some people say forever..well forever is just a word until you prove it..and like..usually relationships end in heartbreak. and that sucks. everyone is always depressed. but if you dont let yourself love someone, is that good or bad? i really dont know..dah. like you cant stop love from happening, but how do you know when its coming.? there is just so many questions. and im wondering, if i ever want to be in a relationship again, and go through the getting hurt, and losing a friend. is it really worth it?? i just dont know anymore..

      Tonight is a story of love  and two broken hearts set by one  All he wants is a sign  of how she's making her mind  All he ever wanted was...   Laugh and love and happy afternoons,  watching t.v from your room  while you're laying in my arms  And I know it's not fair to me  to see this love walk right by me every day  Will we ever meet the right way  again, again   Tonight I will sit next to you  to see if you act like we're through  To make you laugh is all I want  I'll hold you while tears fill our eyes   Laugh and love and happy afternoons,  watching t.v from your room  while you're laying in my arms  And I know it's not fair to me  to see this love walk right by me every day  Will we ever meet the right way.  ------  And the stars aren't out tonight, but neither are we to look up at them why does hello feel like goodbye? these memories can't replace, these wishes I wished and these dreams I chased take this broken heart and make it right I feel like I lost everything when you're gone left remembering what it's like to have you here with me I thought you should know, you're not making this easy

      I love you even though I hate this thing that we've become. I need you even though I can live without this. I know that I should probably hurt so bad but I can't feel a thing. I know that I should probably say something but I can barely breathe. And I'm sorry if I'm giving up too easy I just don't have the strength to fight anymore. I'll forget your bitter taste when you pull your lips away. I'll forget the way you feel and the chill of your embrace. I'll forget the way you look. Don't wanna remember your face. Let's just cut this clean tonight and maybe I'll cry tomorrow.

      i wish i knew how you were feeling.  "I know it will never end Because I know where it began And my heart still heart still pounds twice as fast Whenever you walk by Cause I still love you..." -blindside-  she said "i've gotta be honest, you're wasteing your time if you're fishing round here." and i said "you must be mistaken, cause i'm not fooling...this feeling is real" she said...she said "you gotta be crazy, What do you take me for? Some kind of easy mark? "No, you've got wits, you've got looks,  you've got passion, but I swear that you've got me all wrong."  all wrong. all wrong. but you got me...  i'll be true, i'll be useful... i'll be cavalier...i'll be yours my dear. and i'll belong to you... if you'll just let me through. this is easy as lovers go, so don't complicate it by hesitating. and this is wonderful as loving goes, this is tailor-made, whats the sense in waiting?  and i said "i've gotta be honest i've been waiting for you all my life." for so long i thought i was asylum bound, but just seeing you makes me think twice. and being with you here makes me sane, i fear i'll go crazy if you leave my side. you've got wits...you've got looks, you've got passion but are you brave enough to leave with me tonight?  tonight. tonight. but you've got me...  i'll be true, i'll be useful... i'll be cavalier...i'll be yours my dear. and i'll belong to you... if you'll just let me through. this is easy as lovers go, so don't complicate it by hesitating. and this is wonderful as loving goes, this is tailor-made, whats the sense in waiting? this is easy as lovers go, so don't complicate it by hesitating. and this is wonderful as loving goes, this is tailor-made, whats the sense in waiting? -dashboard confessional, as lovers go-

      You gave me something to hold onto when you offered me your heart. I said I played for keeps. You said that's what you were hoping for.  god i miss amanda so much..like you have no idea. 7 more excruciating days. wow.  teos birthday is sunday...wahoo. i love you teo.  "next time ill lay down, so its not as hard for you to walk all over me"...wow...i love that.  im so bored..  All those sappy love songs I wrote to you, Thinking we would make it through. Everything was going fine, But I guess your heart doesnt control your mind.  "Youre the girl Ive been looking for, Ill give you my love and so much more. I promise to never break your heart, If I can help it we'll never part."  To think I bought those stupid lies, You hid behind your gorgeous eyes, And watched me fall head over heels Then showed me how a heartache feels.  "Everything will get better when I leave" Watch my heart sit on my sleeve. I hope you choke on your joy of being apart, The same way I now choke on my heart.  I think of you and tears come fast, I just cant forget our "perfect" past. I want nothing more to be with you, Even after what youve put me through.  How could you promise to never make me cry? Convinced me you were the perfect guy. Then cheated on me with some other girl, I hope she really 'rocked your world'  Since your so good at taking all I have, And not feeling the least bit sad, Steal this horrible pain in my chest, Dont toss my heart aside like all the rest.  Now your the one whos alone and jaded Look at the mess that youve created. We could of lasted for so much longer, Breaking hearts doesnt make you stronger.  much love, amanda c.

      Here you stand seething with guilt. Silence only justifies.. this act of.. cowardice. The look stapled on your face cries out for forgiveness... the one thing that I cannot give.  (Did you ever see that one person? and the way they do these things, and it hurts you so much.. it's like choking.. choking? choking...)  I can give you freedom from your guilt. with a flick of my wrist, onto yours.. I can give you peace of mind with a forced smile.. I can give you DEATH with the look upon my face.  This is your freedom.. in a life of fallacy... with no last kiss, & no regrets!! you don't deserve good bye. This is your freedom, in a life of fallacy.. with no last kiss.. & no good bye.....  Here you stand seething with guilt. Silence only justifies.. this act of.. cowardice.  With a short story, the one you add to daily, you are the tragic loss. No story book ending for this fairy tale of you. Just the one composed with blood taken from your pen that you hold in your lifeless hand. Cry for you.. Shed tears.. Mourn.. Wish the end..  (Did you ever look, did you ever see that one person, and the subtle way that they do these things and it hurts so much? So much.. it's like choking down the embers of a great blaze. It's that moment when your eyes seem to spread aspersions, and to scream confessions at the insipid sky parting clouds. You let this one person come down in the most.. perfect moment. And it breaks my heart.. to know, the only.. reason you are here now is.. a reminder.. of what I'll never have.. I'll never have..  I'll never... Standing so close knowing that it kills me to breathe you in.. standing so close knowing that it kills me to breathe you in. But this table for one has become bearable. I now take comfort in this, and for this, I cherish you. Did you ever look, did you ever see that one person and the subtle way that they do these things and it hurts so much? So much it's like choking down the embers of a great place. It's that moment when your eyes seem to spread aspersions and to scream confessions at the insipidsky parting clouds. And you let this one person come down.. come down.  I cherish you.. I cherish you. Just say that you would do the same for me.. just say you would do the same.. just say you would do the same for me. For as much as I love Autumn, I'm giving myself to Ashes  love that song...love it.

      "Vindicated"  Hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine of which has caught my eye  And roped me in So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing  I am captivated  [Chorus] I am Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along  And I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself  So clear Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intentions Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye And rendered me so isoloated, so motivated I am certain now that  [Chorus]  So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away [3x] So let me slip against the current  and let me slip away [4x]  [Chorus]  Slight hope It dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption...   i love dashboard confessional. so much.  surprise for you all on saturday evening.   much love, amanda c.

      Out of all the times you've lied, I think my favorite line was "I couldn't love anyone more." Now you're telling her that you've "never loved like this before."   whats up. im so bored. and i really need to get out of my house. i found out my math mark. and i passed. wahoo.  im kindof scared to find out my french one. but oh well.  nothing to talk about. call me if you want to hang out...  much love, amanda c.

      "I'll try," she said as he walked away. "Try not to lose you." Two vibrant hearts could change. Nothing tears the being more than deception, unmasked fear. "I'll be here waiting" tested and secure.  Nothing hurts my world, just affects the ones around me When sin's deep in my blood, you'll be the one to fall.  "I wish I could be the one, the one who won't care at all But being the one on the stand, I know the way to go, no one's guiding me. When time soaked with blood turns its back, I know it's hard to fall. Confined in me was your heart I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me."  Nothing will last in this life, our time is spent constructing, now you're perfecting a world... meant to sin. Constrict your hands around me, squeeze till I cannot breathe, this air tastes dead inside me, contribute to our plague. Break all your promises, tear down this steadfast wall, restraints are useless here, tasting salvation's near.  amanda comes back in 10 days. sweet.  much love, amanda c.

      And I'd give up forever to touch you Cause I know that you feel me somehow You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be And I don't want to go home right now  And all I can taste is this moment And all I can breathe is your life And sooner or later it's over I just don't want to miss you tonight  And I don't want the world to see me Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming Or the moment of truth in your lies When everything feels like the movies Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive  And I don't want the world to see me Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  i know ive posted that before. but i love it so much.  im so tired.  much love, amanda c.

      hey dudes and dudettes. just got home from teos. wow what a night. everything is in her blog. basically beacause im lazy. so read it. its good stuff lol.  i miss amanda so much right now its crazy. like usually when i get home from anywhere i call her..and now i cant..it stinks..i love you amanda.  so i am up to absolutely nothing today. i am so tired. i got up at 6 yesterday. and then stayed up till 3. and got up at like 11. it was nuts.  im very scared for tomorrow because i get my marks..and im hoping to god im not in summerschool. one, because i havent signed up. and two, it would just suck major ass.  Rough drafts of love gone wrong litter my conscience and heart. But you're the perfect masterpiece that I've composed. Beautifully put together, without an error in sight. And I know that you know that we were meant to be. You're everything my corrections came out to be, and I think I've got the hang of this thing called romance. Because whenever you're around it's the perfect setting for this fairy tale. Just don't give up on me now. I know I'm the best thing you'll ever come across, and I hope with all my heart that I can show you that tonight. So if you catch me closing my eyes it's only because I'm wishing that you'll always be mine. It happened that a shooting star was aiming straight for us. And I'd like to call it fate that your hand encloses mine perfectly. And when your lips touch mine, they're no strangers. So that moment I gave you my heart, I already knew that you'd take care of it. Just don't give up on me now. ----- You're the dream that  hasn't ended And I'm still anxious for rest. Your words they seem to hang above my head. You're the bud before the flower, Unfurls into full bloom. Captivating beauty, But it maybe all too soon. You're the song that writes  a story, But leaves a lot to read. The closest thing to  perfect But the farthest thing from me.  alright well im bored. and i have nothing to blog about.  wait! yes i met the famous doug last night. he is really sweet. and he is driving me and teo to a show in stratford on friday and i cant wait. its going to be sweet.  much love, amanda c.

      take these words and shove them down your throat choke untill you turn blue crawl to me, and ill hold it down for you just to make sure it doesnt slip and you get the one last gasping breath it takes to determine if its life or death   did anyone else know there is such things as "men pads"? no..nothing? well its true. on my an teos adventure we found them..while teo almost knocked over a huge bin of balls...and then we wasted all our money on a friking sausage kite that didnt fly..stinks.  well im off, nothing to blog about. have a good night.  much love, amanda c.

A whole conversation is being kept locked away. Just let me know, Darling, when did you plan to tell me falling in love wasn't for us? Your heart doesn't belong to me and you'll never hold my hand quite the same way. Keep the charade of a picture perfect romance up, because the bitter conclusion is coming my way. You'll regret not having a sequel in this romance. I'll show you that I'm the girl you let get away, the one you should have held on to. Breathing is the only thing keeping me alive, but I'll do it just to kill you inside.  i really like those so i decided to post them.  nothing else to say really...you all know what im feeling. so its all good.  much love, amanda c.

      his hair dances in the wind, and he's wondering what love is.. and why it has to end. and he can't understand how everyone goes on breathing when true love ends. his mother whispers quietly ''heavens not a place that you go when you die, its that moment in life when you actually feel alive''

      How does it feel to know you're everything I need  The butterflies in my stomach  they could bring me to my knees  How does it feel to know you're everything I want  I've got a hard time saying this  so I'll sing it in a song   Oh I adore the way you carry yourself  With the grace of a thousand angels overhead  I love the way the galaxy starts to melt   How does it feel  How does it feel when we get locked into a stare?  Please don't come looking for me  when I get lost in the mess of your hair  How do you feel when everything you've known  gets thrown aside  Never fear, my dear, 'cause we have nothing left to hide   Hold on to me girl  If you feel your grip getting loose  just know that I'm right next to you  Hold on to me girl  If you feel your grip getting loose  Just know that I won't let you down   Well, I'm ready  Well, I'm ready  I am ready  To run away with you   Are you ready?  To run away with me   Pack your things we can leave today  Say our goodbyes and get on the train  Say goodbye  Just you and I in the sweet unknown  We can just call each other our home   If I had to choose a way to die  it'd be with you  In a goosebump infested embrace  With my overanxious hands cupping your face  In a goosebump infested embrace  With my overanxious hands cupping your cherub face   How does it feel?   -----  WOW i love lucerin blue..how about anyone else? the singer..jesus christ amazing voice..their amazing..everyone go to www.purevolume.com/lucerinblue.  amanda comes back friday..two days..!  much love, amanda c.

      It's the way that I stay up thinking about you all night. The way when you call me my heart stops. The way you can make me do what you want. The way that I can never say no to you. The way that I love everything about you. The way that you laugh when I say I love your laugh. The way I wake up happy because in some way, I know your mine. The way that right after we hang up I call my bestfriend and jump around and scream. The way you make me feel like I could take on the whole world when your around. The way that I forget about the whole world when I look into your eyes. The way when you touch me all my problems disappear, makes me think that I could be in love with you.

      Hey, wait. Before you walk out for the last time, would you do me this favor? And take, take this paring knife, and thrust it deep, so deep into my side. And be sure, when you draw it from my skin, that my eyes, they meet yours, and you grin.  Because while seeing is believing, sometimes looks can be deceiving. So when I tell you I'm through with you, don't be fooled. I'll be six feet under when I'm over you.  Let's toast. Pour one last drink to us. Make mine one part tonic, two parts poison And be sure, when the glass falls from my lips, that my eyes, they meet yours, and you grin.  Already ripped my heart out of my chest. I watched you watch me bleed. Just what do you have planned for what is left? Take whatever you need.

I asked you, "How you could tell?" You told me to look at the sky.. "Look at all those stars.. Look at how god damn ugly the stars are.."  -----  doesnt it suck letting your heart out to be crushed..so badly that is hurts to breathe. yeah? thought so. especially when you think you have a chance, and you get totally fucked over...but hey...s happens right? sure...of course. i keep telling myself im over it, but i keep replaying that moment, that one perfect moment, over and over in my mind. and id just like to know, what the hell did i do wrong? what makes her so much better then me? you dont know how much i want this.  i think you get the hint.

      Tonight I won't sleep, because then I won't dream. And those dreams are all about you, those tears on my pillow every morning are all about you. The clock blinks in at 2 AM, and I'm wondering what you're doing. Are you dreaming of me? Or has she already filled your head with empty promises? I know she'll break your heart, she'll make the earth crash beneath your feet. And I want so badly to tell you, but I want you to ache. I want you to feel lonely and broken, because that's what you did to me. And even after all of that I want you to love me again. I'd beg you for another chance if you saw me on my knees. But your eyes don't ever rest on me anymore, I think you see right through me. I think you ripped my chest wide open because my heart is still in your hands. I guess you played for keeps. I hope she kills you inside. You said you hoped that I'd forget you. And I told you "only when I forget how to breathe."

      i love the way that you call me at 2 am for no reason. the way that as soon as i come online your the first person to say hi. the way that when i look into your eyes i know that everything is going to be okay. how i can be so mad at you but you can get me so in love 5 seconds later. how you know EXACTLY what to say at the exact right times. the way you know everything about me. the way that whenever something is wrong my hand dials your phone number. how we can talk forever and never have an awkward moment. the way that we can just sit on the phone and just listen to each other breathe and its still so perfect. how i can spend 3 hours yelling at you and still say i love you when i leave. its the way i dont have to impress you. the look in your eyes when i say something stupid. and the way that you hug me when you havent seen me in a long time. its the way that when im with you its like im with my best friend. and its the fact then after we hang out i smile forever and cant stop. and the way that i call my best friend after a night of hanging out and explain to her every single detail of the night. its the way that i miss you after 5 minutes after we hang up the phone. and how you never wanna say goodbye. its everything. thats makes me so scared..to admit..i love you.

      "Do you want me to tell you something really subversive? Love is everything it's cracked up to be. That's why people are so cynical about it. It really is worth fighting for, being brave for, risking everything for. And the trouble is, if you don't risk anything, you risk even more."-Erica Jong.   have you ever met someone..that knew exactly what to do at the exact right times?. its almost like they were reading your mind?. its just so..perfect.   It's crazy after all this time, everythying has stayed the sameYour still doing fine and I'm still that battered lover you don't claim.You are walking ahead of me, but I am crawling all the whileWhen things don't work out like you planned you turn aound and see me, your past, and for a second I stop crying long enough to smile. Turn back around and I am left in pergitory between you and hell. Most of the time I wonder if there is even a difference, cause my heart can't tell.   ---------   I wonder how it feels to know your everything I needEveryone of Cupid's arrows bounced off, but your was the only one that made me bleed.The poison it put in my veins is starting to wear off and I am finally coming to My vision is still blurry, but I am slowly seeing that we're throughYou were going to let me keep playing the game of shooting myself in the chest for as long as I had bullets, but now that you've taken my heart, I don't have enough strength in these fingers to even pull it. I just walk around with this gapeing hole I'll forever wear as a badge,a window through me to serve as a reminder of what I once had.   ---------  i hate how when i look into your eyes i dont see me anymoreyou once called my heart your home, but thats never morethe way you used to hold me had passion and feelingbut now when I say i love you ... you mumble it without meaningthe phone calls are shorter and further aparti should have seen the ned coming but i just didnt have the heart i hate how i look like the fool in all this mess but i just dont know what to do i guess that is what i get for falling so deep in love with you...   &nbsp;

      brandon marsh. where are you. i have not talked to you in light years. and i need to play solitaire. ahhhh.  i had the scariest dream last night. explain it? alllllright. its actually not scary just stupid.  my mom dropped be off at 9 with teo at a party. and had to pick me up at 10 35? i dont know why. so we walked downstairs and tyler and all his friends were there...? haha. then there was a boxing ring..and we all went outside and i was on it..and 2 unmentionables came. and the one was threatening me with a hairbrush. like spinning it saying it would hurt. and i was actually scared. and then another girl came on. before this there was more like at a hockey game and at school but i dont remember. ANYWAYS. then tyler joined in and told me that he didnt actually like me and it was all a bet. and then i said to amanda "i told you it was a bet". and then i woke up. and i thought it had actually happened. and i was so scurred. i dont think it did though.  well thats it then.  dont make fun of me i dont make my dreams.  haha.  love, moe.

      being in cottage country, and having TONS of time on your hands really does make you think. a little to much for me i might add.  what im thinking about you ask?. well..hmm where do i start.  all my friends know me, and how much i say i want the perfect relationship. i say it all the time, i admit to that. i think a lot of us do want that, something real..and perfect. and at one point in time i did have that. but it wasnt till, like a couple days ago i really thought about it. to get it to that stage of "perfect", took a while..a very long while. and with me sometimes i am SO anxious, to just get to that stage i always go back to that same person. and i never really give anyone a chance, even if i like them a hell of a lot. so i learned that i need to be patient. and i think i am over that whole stage of moving quickly, because im so happy right now..with tyler, and with everything. and who knows maybe in a, while? i will be able to say those same words i said to someone before..i dont know what will happen. but i know i like him so much and i want to just..have fun with what i have and be happy. cause i havent been happy, really happy, for a long time..and finally i have something that makes me smile for no reason all the time. and i need that. i dont know what im trying to get to, i guess this is just for myself, i needed to express it in words. its just how i am, im always anxious..but i realized its not the best thing, and sometimes the ride to the destination is the best thing..and i have to take advantage with what i have. cause i am so lucky right now. i really dont deserve what i have. and i have a feeling this time, its going to be different..and i cant wait to see what happens..  well i have more but i dont want to bore anyone..with it all.  so i guess ill go now.  love, moe.
