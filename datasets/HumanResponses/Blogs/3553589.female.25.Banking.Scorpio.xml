      One of the things I love about working for NABABNA is that NABABNA embraces diversity.&nbsp; It is wonderful to work for a company that:   gleefully offers health insurance to domestic partners, completely not caring if your domestic partner is of the same sex or the opposite sex of you (which, if you listen to the stupid, stupid man who is running our country, is completely wrong and we're probably all going to hell)  promotes on the basis of who the best person for the job is and pays everyone in the position the same wage, not promoting or paying based on race, gender or sexual preference  is heavily involved in community programs that benefit  all people  and will not contribute to community programs that exclude based on race, gender or sexual preference   As you can imagine, this sometimes draws fire from the, oh, how do I say this tactfully?&nbsp; The absolute morons who think that they are better than everyone else and how dare we support anything that they personally feel is wrong?&nbsp; Now, people, I don't have a problem with you believing what you want.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's your right as an American.&nbsp; However, that does not give you the order&nbsp;me to change my&nbsp;beliefs,&nbsp;it does not give you the right to suppress others because they are of a different race, gender or sexual preference than and it certainly does not give you the right to perform hate crimes against said others as well.  So, anyway,&nbsp;NABABNA has been involved in sponsoring Pride Festivals.&nbsp; And there are people who don't like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is fine, I accept that&nbsp;they have a right to their opinion.&nbsp; Just like I have the right to think that they are silly, narrow-minded people.&nbsp; And if they don't want to bank at NABABNA because they don't like the fact that we support Pride, that's also fine.&nbsp; Go ahead and leave.&nbsp; Maybe you can find the local branch of&nbsp;the We Hate Everyone Who Isn't Us bank.  What I do have a problem with is when these people think that it would be a great idea to call and feed me their propaganda.&nbsp; Here is a conversation that I had last month with a customer.&nbsp; Or, I should say, soon to be ex-customer.&nbsp; In order for you to get the true effect of the call, imagine that the words in italic parentheses are what he is actually saying.&nbsp; So if he said "You people" his tone would indicate that he was placing us on the same level with  (leperous dregs of society).   A banker calls up and tells me that he has a customer who wants to speak to a supervisor but won't say why.&nbsp; This happens occasionally and so I ask the banker to transfer the customer.  DM:&nbsp; Thank you for holding, sir.&nbsp; My name is Dana and I'm a supervisor at NABABNA.&nbsp; How may I help you?  Self-righteous idiot who is going to annoy me very much (SRI for short):&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I was driving through Name of City yesterday and I saw that they were having a Pride Festival  (Ritual Slaying of Small Children) .&nbsp; And then I saw&nbsp;representatives from NABABNA  (representatives of SATAN)  had a booth there.&nbsp; This is disgusting.  DM:&nbsp; Well, sir, NABABNA prides itself on it's diversity (yes, I said pride.&nbsp; Yes, I did it on purpose to indicate that I thought he was a narrow-minded bigot and I now hated him with a fiery passion) and...  SRI (cuts me off):&nbsp; Well, your diversity  (diseased-ridden values)  is why you will be losing me  (akin to royalty)  as your customer.  DM:&nbsp; I'm sorry to hear that, sir  (I am rejoicing and singing praises to God) .  Here's what this guy doesn't know.&nbsp; I have five male friends.&nbsp; I love them all very, very much and they are all gay.&nbsp; And when you start knocking gays and saying that they shouldn't have the right to marry or adopt or breathe, you're talking about my extended family.&nbsp; And you're ticking me off.&nbsp; So I love the fact that NABABNA is out there supporting Pride.&nbsp; And if you don't like it, well,&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;sorry to see you leave but I hope that someday you will see the light and realize that you're not any better than anyone else.

       Since customers are such an amusing source of humor, I've kept a small list over the years of random things I've heard.&nbsp; This is in no way a complete list.&nbsp; I could never have a complete list.&nbsp; I'd like to discuss a few of these now.     &nbsp;   WRONG ANSWER!    NABABNA used to take calls for other banks when they were closed to help with certain lost/stolen procedures.&nbsp; Basically, we closed cash cards over the weekend because the other banks couldn't afford to keep their locations open to close 1 card every 5 weeks.&nbsp; (This is effective in cost management to outsource this function.)&nbsp; The thing about this line that customers would dial was that people called it when they wanted to talk to their bank, not just to close their cards.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   The only, ONLY function we had was the ability to close the cards.    We couldn't activate the cards.    We couldn't tell you your balance.    We couldn't find branches in your area.    We had no clue what you spent last week.     &nbsp;   There was a man.&nbsp; He was an angry man.&nbsp; I'm not going so far to say psychotic, but he could have found benefits in speaking frankly with a therapist.&nbsp; This is my impression.&nbsp;    He didn't lose his card.&nbsp; He still had it.&nbsp; He wanted to know his balance.&nbsp; Here is our conversation (I am B, he is I, it stands for IDIOT!)    B:&nbsp; Thank you for calling the 'card closing line'.&nbsp; Is your card lost or stolen?    I:&nbsp; I want my balance.    B:&nbsp; I'm sorry sir.&nbsp; We are an after hours closing service your bank hired to help in situations of lost or stolen cards.    I:&nbsp; I don't believe this.&nbsp; You have my balance and you won't give it to me.    B:&nbsp; I'm sorry again sir.&nbsp; I do not work for your bank and I have no access to your accounts other than to close a cash card.    I:&nbsp; WRONG ANSWER!    B:&nbsp; But I don't work for your bank.&nbsp;    I:&nbsp; WRONG ANSWER!    B:&nbsp;  I sit in stunned silence.     I:&nbsp; I want to talk to the president of the bank, right now!    B:&nbsp; Sir, your bank is closed.&nbsp; I don't have the president's phone number.    I:&nbsp; WRONG ANSWER!    B:&nbsp;  At this point, I want to say, I'd love to get rid of you, you are dumb.&nbsp; Do you think I want you yelling at me because you're stupid?&nbsp; I don't enjoy you yelling at me.&nbsp;      I sit in silence.     I:&nbsp; Answer me!    B:&nbsp; I am unable to give you a different answer.&nbsp; I don't work for your bank.&nbsp; You can call them when they are open.    I:&nbsp; I want you to give me my balance.    B:&nbsp; The only thing I could do is close your card.&nbsp;    The customer hangs up.&nbsp; I think it's because I didn't give him his balance, but I'd like to think it was because he was afraid that giving me his information would make his card stop working.&nbsp; Not that I'd do that, mainly because I've dealt with customers who had this happen.&nbsp; I love it when customers get upset because they have the wrong number.&nbsp; Here are another couple of examples where the customer should not have called us:     &nbsp;   I2 - guess what this stands for!     &nbsp;   Banker calls me.&nbsp; "I have a customer who is upset that I can't find her account.&nbsp; She wants to talk to a supervisor."    B:&nbsp; Okay, I'll be happy to help.&nbsp; Send her through.    Transfer takes place.    B:&nbsp; Thank you for holding ma'am.&nbsp; I'm a supervisor here at NABABNA.&nbsp; Tony ( the banker ) said that you wanted to talk to a supervisor because he couldn't find your account?    I2:&nbsp; That's correct.&nbsp; I don't understand what a problem you are having.&nbsp; I never have this problem when I call NABABNA.&nbsp; It's only when I call Bank of Bank.&nbsp;    B:&nbsp; Um, you did call NABABNA.&nbsp;    I2:&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; That's probably why you couldn't find my Bank of Bank account.&nbsp; [long pause]&nbsp; Would you please apologize to that banker?&nbsp; I was not pleasant to him.    B:&nbsp; Sure, I can do that.&nbsp; Why don't you put all of your accounts with us and then you only need one phone number?    I2:&nbsp; I think I'll do that!&nbsp; Thank you.     &nbsp;   She was nice enough, once she understood she dialed the wrong number.&nbsp; It was very funny.     &nbsp;   We actually get a lot of wrong numbers.&nbsp; This surprises me.&nbsp; Our phone lines answer as an automated service and it starts the message as, "Thank you for calling NABABNA."&nbsp; And then these people go through the prompts, get to a banker, listen to the banker say, "NABABNA, My name is...", ask their question, and then FINALLY realize they've called the wrong bank.&nbsp; I was amazed when the call escalated.&nbsp; That woman heard the name of the company 3 times and she still never caught it.     &nbsp;   One of the bankers on our team got this call last night (I'll call the banker Q):    Q:&nbsp; Thank you for calling NABABNA.&nbsp; This is Q.&nbsp; How can I help you?    I3 (guess why he's called that!):&nbsp; Do you have the phone number for bank locations.    Q:&nbsp; I can look up one of our branches for you.&nbsp; What state is it in?    I3:&nbsp; Illinois.    Q:&nbsp; What branch did you want?    I3:&nbsp; Well, it's for Bank of Bank.&nbsp;    Q:&nbsp; Um, unfortunately we only have the addresses and phone numbers for banks that are part of our company.    I3:&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp;    [Long pause.]    I3:&nbsp; How do you think I could get the number for that bank?    Q:&nbsp; Have you tried Directory Assistance?    I3:&nbsp; I'll try that.&nbsp; Thanks!    Q:&nbsp; Thank you for calling.&nbsp; I'm glad I could...help.     &nbsp;   Now I must ask.&nbsp; This customer knew that he wasn't calling the bank he wanted.&nbsp; Why would he think we had the phone number for a different bank?&nbsp; Do you call Wal-Mart to find out where a Target is located?&nbsp; Have you ever walked up to a Burger King asking where McDonald's was?&nbsp; Would this even cross your mind as an option???&nbsp; I don't get it.&nbsp; People are crazy.&nbsp; And dumb. &nbsp;

       DM has mentioned that we take escalated calls at a large banking call center.&nbsp; Customers are more amusing than any stand-up comic.&nbsp; In fact, I encourage customer service representatives to go into stand-up comedy for the amusement of the world.&nbsp; People must know these crazy things.     &nbsp;   People in general are stupid.&nbsp; I'm not saying every person is stupid, just in general, people are stupid.&nbsp; There are ways to hide the moronic things we do, but unfortunately, some people don't have this built into their genetic make-up.&nbsp; This is good, because it makes for a fun story.     &nbsp;   Not too long ago, a customer said to me, and I quote, "I didn't fall off the apple tree yesterday.&nbsp; I'm hip."&nbsp; Now, this doesn't make sense to me.&nbsp; Besides the fact that people don't usually fall off of apple trees, I'm pretty sure there is no hip hop songs with the lyrics, "I was climbing on the apple tree, I didn't fall off you see."&nbsp; I wanted to explain that if she is using the phrase, "I didn't fall off the apple tree yesterday," this automatically disqualifies her from being hip.     &nbsp;   One of the best examples of a moronic moment I've come across is from about two and a half years ago.&nbsp; I will remember this woman for the rest of my life.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Side note: Oh my God, there's a grown man dressed up as Peter Pan on T.V. because he dresses like this everyday of his life.&nbsp; I'm so unbelievably scared.&nbsp; Conan O'Brien finds the strangest guests.&nbsp; This guy brought pictures of himself in many different fairy outfits.&nbsp; He just said he's single and straight and loves the ladies.&nbsp; He called his outfit the glitter star fairy.&nbsp; Conan just asked him what he wears for Halloween.&nbsp; He has problems for Halloween.&nbsp; He's 50 years old.&nbsp; But he said he's 5.&nbsp; He's been dressing like this for over 20 years.&nbsp; And now he's making Conan wear his hat.&nbsp; He has a website.&nbsp;   urlLink  www.pixyland.org   &nbsp; This is what they said on Conan and I searched.&nbsp; The site won't load right now but I'm pretty sure of the address.&nbsp; I'm scared.     &nbsp;   This is about how the call at NABABNA went:     &nbsp;   B (Me): Thank you for holding.&nbsp; My name is Beth and I'm a supervisor.&nbsp; How can I help you?    C (Customer): I want you to tell me right now who's been calling me and make them stop.    B:&nbsp; I'd be happy to help you as much as I can, you said someone has been calling you?&nbsp; Are they from NABABNA?    C: Well, yes.&nbsp; (She scoffs at me.)    B:&nbsp; Did they leave a message?    C:&nbsp; I want them to stop calling me.    B:&nbsp; Okay, have you talked to them?    C:&nbsp; No.    B:&nbsp; Do you have the name or department of who's calling you?    C: No.&nbsp; Make them stop.&nbsp; Figure out who they are right now!    B:&nbsp; I'm trying to help you.&nbsp; I don't have any comments or notations of anyone calling you.&nbsp; I'll need some help from you.    C:&nbsp; I&nbsp;mean it.&nbsp; They need to stop.&nbsp;    B:&nbsp; I understand that.&nbsp; Have they left messages?&nbsp; (I try asking again.)    C:&nbsp; No.&nbsp;    B:&nbsp; So you haven't talked to anyone and they're not leaving messages.&nbsp; Are you finding our number on your Caller ID?    C:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Make them stop.    B:&nbsp; You've said that.&nbsp; I want to help you.     &nbsp;   Okay, so after 28 minutes of going back and forth of who is calling you, how do you know they are calling you, and her yelling (getting more and more frustrated and louder), she finally says:    C:&nbsp; Stop calling me.&nbsp; Every time I push redial, it calls you people!    I hit the mute button so fast and bust out laughing.&nbsp; I composed myself quickly and stated to the customer:    B:&nbsp; Um, ma'am, redial calls the person you called last, not who called you.    There is a pause.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   It's a long pause.     &nbsp;   C:&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I just don't get this whole technology thing!&nbsp; I'm just a blonde.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Here's the thing.&nbsp; Redial is not technology.&nbsp; It hasn't been for what, 20 years?&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Again, I say, people are stupid.

      Yeah, funny, huh?&nbsp; Working in the banking industry, I have come to believe that people should take a class before they are allowed to open up a checking account.&nbsp; I believe this because I wish I would have taken one before I opened up my checking account at the tender age of 18 (19 years ago, sigh) and I actually thought this to be true.&nbsp; I also work on the help desk at a major bank and will routinely get calls from customers who are extremely angry with "You People."&nbsp; Here's a tip, people of the internet, when you have overdrawn your account at any bank, it doesn't matter where you bank, perhaps screaming at the person trying to help you might not be the best way to handle it.&nbsp; I know, it's shocking for me to even say this, but calling me a f*cking c*nt does not make me want to help you. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Here is probably the most amusing ATM story I have heard.&nbsp; Customer calls in.&nbsp; "I went to the ATM to make a deposit.&nbsp; My card wasn't working."&nbsp; Banker thinks the customer is calling in to get a replacement card.&nbsp; Logical, right?&nbsp; Customer continues "I turned to the guy behind me and asked if I could use his card to make my deposit and he said yes.&nbsp; He entered in his secret code and everything.&nbsp; Where's my money?"&nbsp; Here's the thing, people.&nbsp; She was serious.&nbsp; She honestly thought that using the ATM card of some random stranger would make her deposit go into her account. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Things you should know about ATM machines:  &nbsp;    If the machine doesn't have your bank's name on the top and you are charged a fee for using it, that's not our fault.&nbsp; Banks are required to disclose all fees to their customers.&nbsp; Read your disclosures.&nbsp; Once you sign that account application, you are agreeing to the disclosures and future changes to the disclosures.&nbsp; If you're not comfortable with that, don't sign the application!  Do not make a deposit at a machine that is not owned by your bank.&nbsp; There is no guarantee that you will ever receive the deposit into your account.&nbsp; You would be truly amazed at the number of people who want to do this.  Do not give your PIN # (secret code) to anyone.&nbsp; I don't care if it's your husband, wife, parent, child, best friend or whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your card is used without your permission and it turns out to be because you gave someone your PIN #, well, you can pretty much kiss that money goodbye.&nbsp; Don't write your PIN # on your card either.  If you have the opportunity to print a statement from the ATM, don't do it.&nbsp; Most banks charge for that.&nbsp; Most banks also provide free online banking.&nbsp; Why pay for something you can get for free?   Okay, I'm going to get off my soapbox.&nbsp;&nbsp;But please, listen to my advice.&nbsp; Only you can prevent overdraft fees.&nbsp; Keep a register.&nbsp; Don't spend money you don't have.&nbsp; Oh and with today's technology, yes, it is possible to write a check to someone and have it go through your account on the same day. &nbsp;Don't try to beat the bank, people, it doesn't work.

      Working in the banking industry, I have realized many things, including the fact that certain people should not be allowed to having checking accounts.&nbsp; Here at&nbsp;NABABNA, I routinely deal with calls from people who have used the following excuses for being overdrawn (Because I want to keep my job, I don't say what I want to them. I wait until I get the chance to blog. What I want to say is in italics):  &nbsp;  "I'm too busy to keep a register. I work for a living."  "Oh, and I don't?&nbsp; Well, I hope you earn a lot of money at your job.&nbsp; Because I'm not reversing your fees.&nbsp; Moron."   &nbsp;  "It's not my fault that I'm overdrawn.&nbsp; I checked the automated system and it told me that my balance was $53.05.&nbsp; So I went shopping.&nbsp; The automated system was wrong!&nbsp; You people lie!"  "Okay, repeat after me.&nbsp; The automated system can only tell you what has posted or is pending to your account.&nbsp; Since the automated system is not psychic, it does not know that you wrote out a $43 check out two days ago."   &nbsp;  "Well, the ATM machine gave me the money.&nbsp; If I was overdrawn, I shouldn't have been able to withdraw any money."&nbsp;  "First of all, you withdrew the money from a non-NABABNA&nbsp;ATM.&nbsp; Because it isn't in the&nbsp;NABABNA network, it has no idea how much money you have.&nbsp; Second of all, do you really want us following you around and saying 'Oh, no, don't make that withdrawal.&nbsp; You don't have the money for it.'&nbsp; No, I didn't think so."   &nbsp;  With that all said, there's a reason why I am sometimes lenient and will reverse a fee for those customers that will admit that they made a mistake and don't call in every time they get a fee.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that reason is that I, myself, am an idiot.&nbsp; The following numbers are the result of my attempt to keep a ledger.&nbsp; Be afraid.&nbsp; Be very afraid.&nbsp;  &nbsp;    Starting balance.......$80.00  Minus SA...................$11.34  Subtotal.....................$68.36  Minus Carmike........$11.00 (pop and popcorn for Dodgeball for 2)  Subtotal....................$77.36  Minus Chalet...........$10.00 ($4 for pop. $6 tip.)  Subtotal...................$67.36  Minus Carmike.......$7.50 (matinee tickets for Dodgeball for 2)  Subtotal...................$59.86  Perkins.....................$18.00  Total.........................$41.86   I handed my register to Keem and asked her to check my figures. Then I watched her and Beth disolve into helpless laughter. What is wrong (other than the fact that I spent more money on concessions than the actual movie) is, I am sure, painfully obvious to all people who are not me, my actual total should have been $22.16.&nbsp; I, apparently, need someone to follow me around. Of course, the difference between myself and the&nbsp;NABABNA customers is that when I get an overdraft fee, I don't whine about it.

       Hi.&nbsp; My name is DM (short for Dana Marie).&nbsp; My friend Beth and I work for a major bank in America.&nbsp;&nbsp;We work in the customer service phone bank and take what's known as escalated calls.&nbsp; What does this mean?&nbsp; Mainly that&nbsp;we take calls from the customers who are upset with the bank.&nbsp; Now, yes, everyone makes mistakes and&nbsp;we do receive the occasional call from customers who have legitimate concerns with bank errors but the majority of the calls&nbsp;we receive are from people who have made mistakes on their own accounts.&nbsp;   Some of these people are wonderful to deal with because they are asking us to help them and are polite, calm individuals.&nbsp; And some of these people, the people that&nbsp;Beth and I are going to blog about, are morons.&nbsp;   Because&nbsp;we really love&nbsp;our jobs, there is no way we're going to tell you who we really work for.&nbsp; From now on, our company will be referred to as NABABNA, short for National American Bank of America, Baby, National Association.&nbsp; Yes, it's a weird name.&nbsp; But NABABNA is fun to say and so not close to&nbsp;the real name of our bank.  We will also be, for your reading pleasure, provide you with conversations that we have overheard or, sometimes, been forced to be involved in.&nbsp;   Just for the record, names have been changed to protect the innocent and not so innocent, if the customer we're talking about sounds like you, it's really not (but if you think it is, then you should probably really consider your banking habits), and yes, sometimes I will exaggerate for humor's sake.&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually I don't have to exaggerate, though, and will normally indicate when I've done so.&nbsp;   Hope you enjoy!&nbsp; Ciao.&nbsp; DM&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Recently, I took an escalated call.&nbsp; Now, this, in itself, is not that amusing.&nbsp; Having someone scream at you is not fun, especially if you're trying to calm the person down so you can help them.&nbsp; I have had to, on one occasion, actually interrupt a customer (huge no-no in the customer service field but what are you gonna do?) and say "I am trying to help you.&nbsp; Please be quiet and listen to me.&nbsp; I do not want you to close your account.&nbsp; You are the victim of fraud and I want to help you get your money back.&nbsp; Do you understand what I am trying to say?"&nbsp; The customer stopped screaming and said (and I quote) "Oh.&nbsp; I guess it's really not NABABNA's fault that I'm being ripped off, huh?"&nbsp;   So, anyway, the call I'm referring to was from a customer who was upset that his account was closed and he was referred to a collection agency.&nbsp; He seemed to believe this was NABABNA's error.&nbsp; Here is our conversation.&nbsp; Remember, when I use italics, this is what I am thinking, not saying to the customer...well, unless I've got the mute button on.  DM (that's me!):&nbsp; Thank you for holding, sir.&nbsp; My name is DM and I am a supervisor.&nbsp; The banker told me that you wanted to speak to me about the fact that your account was closed?  Raving Idiot (RI for short):&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I haven't used my account since February and apparently, you were allowing Large Insurance Company (LIC) to debit money from my account.&nbsp; This caused me to become overdrawn and then you reported me to a collection agency.&nbsp; This is wrong, wrong, wrong and you are all evil pigs who must die.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   DM:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Let me make sure I understand this, sir.&nbsp; LIC was withdrawing money from your account fraudulently?  RI:&nbsp; No, no!&nbsp; Where did you get that from?&nbsp; I had set up payments with them and forgot to cancel the payment when I moved.&nbsp; God, you're stupid.  DM:&nbsp;  I'm stupid?&nbsp; I'm stupid?&nbsp; Listen, you jackass... &nbsp; I'm sorry you feel that I am stupid, sir.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just trying to understand&nbsp;the situation.&nbsp; Did you contact us when you received your statement to let us know that this had happened?  RI:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I never got a statement.&nbsp; You people didn't send me one.  DM:&nbsp;  I am&nbsp;only one person, sir.&nbsp; I am not plural. &nbsp; Oh, that's unfortunate.&nbsp; I'm not showing that we've received statements back from the Post Office.&nbsp; Let's&nbsp;verify your address to make sure we're sending the statements to the right address.&nbsp; Would you please give me your address?  RI:&nbsp; I don't know what you have.&nbsp; I've moved six times since February.  DM:&nbsp;  Well, you're obviously a stable and trustworthy person.&nbsp; Hey, I think I've dated you. &nbsp; Ah.&nbsp; Did you update your address with us, sir?  RI:&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Why would I do that?&nbsp; I wasn't using the account!&nbsp; And quit changing the subject!&nbsp; Why did you let LIC take money out of my account?  DM:&nbsp; Well, sir, you set up automatic payments with them.&nbsp; In order to stop the payments from coming out of the account, we would ask you to contact LIC.  RI:&nbsp; Stop blaming LIC!&nbsp; I've already talked to them!&nbsp; I want you to open this account back up so they can give me the money back.&nbsp; God, why don't you listen?  DM:&nbsp;  Oh, I don't know.&nbsp; Maybe because you're a babbling idiot?&nbsp;  Please forgive me, sir, I'm just trying to find out what you want by asking questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have realized you wanted to open the account.&nbsp;  By using my psychic powers .&nbsp;&nbsp; I apologize but unfortunately, I would be unable to assist you&nbsp;with your request.&nbsp; If you would be willing to visit a branch, they would be able to determine if they will be able to reopen the account.  RI:&nbsp; I'm not going to the branch.&nbsp; I've already wasted all&nbsp;the time I'm going to spend with you people.&nbsp; I can't open up a new account with Bank of Bank because of you people screwing up my account.&nbsp; Get my name removed from that collection agency so I can open up a new account.  DM:&nbsp; I do apologize, sir, but I am unable to do what you request.&nbsp; If you would visit a branch...  RI:&nbsp; I'm not talking to you anymore.&nbsp; You're never going to get your money back because you won't do this.&nbsp; You're a stupid (word that rhymes with witch but yet, oddly, starts with a B)!&nbsp;   Customer disconnects.&nbsp; I spend a few minutes laughing at him because well, he's an idiot.&nbsp; He's already been reported to the collection agency and, by law, he will not be able to open up a new account at any bank until after&nbsp;his name from&nbsp;said collection agency for at least a year...unless, of course, he goes to a credit union&nbsp;and they don't check the list.  Let's review, shall we?&nbsp; What did the customer do wrong?&nbsp;    He did not change his address with his bank.  He did not cancel his payments with LIC.  He did not think "Hey, maybe I should close this account if I'm not going to be using it anymore instead of&nbsp;blithely frolicking through life without a care or single responsible thought in my brain and just assuming that everything will be okay."   The very same day, I receive a call from a banker who asks me to look at an account with him.&nbsp; The banker, let's call him Kyle, says to me that he is speaking to a customer who thought he closed his account in February.&nbsp; I say "Is his name Raving Idiot, by any chance?"  Kyle:&nbsp; No, it's Idiot Beyond-Reason.&nbsp; Why?  DM:&nbsp; Um, no reason.&nbsp; Do you have his account number?  Kyle:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Here it is.&nbsp; (I pull up the account.)&nbsp; As you can see, there is quite a lot of activity on this account, for something that he apparently hasn't been using.&nbsp; I asked him about the purchases and ATM withdrawals and he says that he cut up his card in February.&nbsp; So he wants to dispute all of the activity on this account since February.  DM:&nbsp; But, but there are payroll deposits into this account.&nbsp; Doesn't he know that he's not getting his money?  Kyle:&nbsp; Well, that's the thing.&nbsp; If you look at these deposits, you'll see that these deposits are not in Mr. Beyond-Reason's name.&nbsp; They are actually in the name of&nbsp;Ima Random-Woman.  DM:&nbsp; Okay, I'm completely confused.&nbsp; Who is that?  Kyle:&nbsp; I asked him that and he first told me he didn't know.&nbsp;   DM:&nbsp; This account has been receiving these deposits since last October.&nbsp;   Kyle:&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; I asked him about that.&nbsp; He then said that this might be the name of his ex-girlfriend but he doesn't really remember what her name is.  DM:&nbsp; Wait.&nbsp; He&nbsp;doesn't remember the name of his girlfriend from what?&nbsp; Six months ago?&nbsp; (Kyle and I pause in reflection...okay, you caught me.&nbsp; We paused to laugh hysterically.)  Kyle:&nbsp; Yeah, that's what he said.&nbsp; He then admitted he doesn't really know if he cut up the card or not.  DM:&nbsp; Since this is a sole owner account, did it ever occur to him to call us and oh, I don't know, close his account?  Kyle:&nbsp; Apparently not.  DM:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Here's what you do.&nbsp; Explain to him that to dispute all of the purchases and ATM withdrawals, you also need to dispute all of the deposits as well.&nbsp; Get a phone number for him and then ask your manager if you can file this claim off of the phone.&nbsp; This one's going to take awhile.  Kyle:&nbsp; That's what I figured.&nbsp; Thanks, DM.  DM:&nbsp; Have fun.&nbsp;   I later ran into Kyle and he told me that the customer continued to insist that he was not the one using this account and everything should be disputed.&nbsp; Kyle filed all of the claims and then tried to call the customer back to give him the reference numbers.&nbsp; The phone number, mysteriously, did not work.&nbsp; So, probably what happened?&nbsp; Mr. Idiot Beyond-Reason probably just broke up with Ms. Random-Woman and is ticked off at her.&nbsp; So he's going to pay her back by getting all of her deposits returned.&nbsp; Not thinking about the fact that, hey, the account is in his name and he's responsible for it!&nbsp;   Moral of my story:&nbsp; Please, please, please...if you move, change&nbsp;your address with your bank.&nbsp; Don't just assume everything's going to be okay.&nbsp; Do you want to go through life knowing that I'm secretly laughing at you?

       No, this is not work related.  However, it is a very important that the Morons of America wake up and realize that this behavior needs to stop.  It needs to stop now.  What am I talking about, you ask?  Well, dear reader, please continue reading and all will be revealed.  Those of you that know me personally (or have read  urlLink Green Duckies )  know that I'm a bit of a movie buff.  I love movies.  I would spend all day watching movies if I could.  I would love to write reviews but since I would prefer to watch the Porky's Trilogy over The Hours, I'm not sure I would be taken seriously.  When I pay $7.50 for a movie, I want to experience every last minute of the movie going experience, which includes the previews and the Fandango commercial.  Don't mess around during the Fandango commercial, people!  It makes me seriously cranky.  I even enjoy the Movies - They're Worth It campaign that was going on.  Movie Piracy is bad.  Don't steal.   But I digress (yes, I know you're all really surprised by this).  The point is, that when I go to the movies, I want to watch the movies.   So let's just cover some Dana Movie Don'ts, shall we?    If I wanted to deal with children, I'd ask my sister if I could baby-sit Josh.  Do not bring small children to a movie unless it is a movie deliberately marketed for said small children.  In other words, your four year old son is not going to want to sit through I, Robot and is going to continue talking no matter how many times you shush him.  He is seriously bored.  And I, I am seriously pissed.  Movie theaters are not babysitters.  You may think your teen or "tween" is old enough to go to the movies by themselves but they really aren't.  Do you know what they're going to do while you're gone?  They are going to run up and down the stairs, throw candy at one another, have a conversation about what boy they really like and, well, really irritate me to the point that I'm ready to wait for you in the parking lot and make you give me my $7.50 back because you just don't have any sense of responsibility.  To the women who thought it was a great idea to sit next to me during Love Actually, let me just cover a few things.  Yes, that's Rowan Atkinson who yes, did play Mr. Bean at one time in his career (but, since he is a comic genius, he has played other points and I love him and he is on screen and shut up already!).  Yes, Hugh Grant is really hot.  No, I don't care about what you had for lunch, what you think is going to happen next or about Billy Bob Thornton and Angelina Jolie's marriage.  I am here to watch a movie.  If I wanted your opinion on everything, I would ask you out to dinner.  To the little punk who shushed me during Anchorman, I am older than you, I outweigh you and I probably outmean you as well.  You and your little brat friends deserved to be told to sit down and you know it.  Don't shush me and try to play all innocent with your "We're trying to watch a movie" comment because I laughed.  Anchorman, moron in training, is a comedy.  People will laugh during it.  And consider it this way, I only told you five to sit down and keep quiet.  Someone not as tolerant as me might, oh, I don't know, beat the crap out of you?  I have witnesses to your behavior throughout the entire movie.  You're really lucky I didn't have you thrown out.  Next time, I will.   Okay, so, if you, by any chance, recognize yourself from this post, please take the time to consider how your actions affect others.  I am a very easy going person and if you're pissing me off, I'm thinking the multitude of people in the theater are not going to bat an eye when I drag you out of the theater by your hair.  I'm thinking I might even get a medal.

       Tonight at work, I may have dealt with one of the most unique questions I've found in 7 years at NABABNA.&nbsp; It's not really the request that inspired me to blog, but the fact that the woman I was talking to was the perfect example of insanity.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   This woman was upset that the advertisements the bank sends out were only arriving in one of her account statements.&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; She was furious that the bank wasn't advertising to her the same offers MORE THAN ONCE.&nbsp; She wants us to send her multiple pieces of shiny paper that can just clutter up her home.&nbsp; This is weird in the first place.     &nbsp;   I'll admit.&nbsp; This woman got wrong information from many sources at NABABNA.&nbsp; Here's the highlights of the call:     &nbsp;   Banker, I'll call him Frank or F calls me (B).&nbsp; The woman will be Loudmouth.&nbsp; Okay, Frank calls:     &nbsp;   B:&nbsp; Thanks for calling.&nbsp; How can I help you?    F:&nbsp; I was talking to another supervisor and I got disconnected  because they didn't want to deal with this crazy situation and they were trying to find a way out. &nbsp; (Okay, the italics are what I'm sure the guy was thinking.)    B:&nbsp; I'm sorry about that.&nbsp; What's the problem?    F:&nbsp; This woman wants us to send her lots of paper and she's pissed off because we don't kill multiple trees so she can read the same thing over and over.    B:&nbsp; I'd be happy to help you.    F:&nbsp; I told her that it has to do with her privacy preferences.    B:&nbsp; That doesn't sound right.&nbsp; I don't know the exact answer, but that shouldn't have anything to do with it.    F:&nbsp; Well, that's what the other supervisor told me and they were checking on it when I got disconnected.    B:&nbsp; That's fine.&nbsp; Since we're supposed to take over this type of call, I'll ask for you to put the customer through now.    F:&nbsp; Okay [pause], Ms. Loudmouth...    Loudmouth: You're wrong!&nbsp; Privacy preference laws only talk about sharing my information with outside companies.&nbsp; You can advertise to me all those programs and services your company offers!&nbsp; I don't think this is right.&nbsp; This call has lasted too long.&nbsp; I don't like this.&nbsp; You don't know what you're doing.&nbsp;    B:&nbsp; [I interrupt now - yes, I interrupted.&nbsp; I know it's wrong, but I've been monitored already.]&nbsp; Frank, I can take care of this now.&nbsp; Ms. Loudmouth, my name is Beth and I'm a supervisor here.&nbsp; I'd like to help...    L:&nbsp; He doesn't know what he's talking about.&nbsp; I don't want to explain this again.    B:&nbsp; I already know what is going on and I'd like to place you on hold while I see if this can be corrected.&nbsp; Can you hold?    L:&nbsp; I told him everything!&nbsp; I talked to the President of the branch here years ago and he said it had to do with a conversion and my Social Security number.&nbsp; I don't think this is right.&nbsp; I want insurance.&nbsp; I should get my free $1,000.    [By the way, I have no clue how a bank would give away a free $1,000.&nbsp; This seems, in a word, odd.]&nbsp; He's not there anymore.&nbsp; He was too good.&nbsp; He got promoted and I don't want to deal with this.&nbsp; I've been on the phone for almost an hour.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with privacy preferences.&nbsp; You can advertise to me.&nbsp; I just don't think I care anymore.&nbsp; That banker doesn't know what he's doing.&nbsp; I already know the answer.&nbsp; The President of the bank told me it years ago.&nbsp; [Yes, she basically looped back and forth.&nbsp; There was never a breath.&nbsp; Never!]&nbsp; I hate you people...    B:&nbsp; Ms. Loudmouth, I would like to help you.&nbsp; Can I place you on hold?&nbsp; [Yes, I interrupted again.]    L:&nbsp; I already know the answer.&nbsp; I want my advertising.&nbsp; I deserve my free $1,000.&nbsp; What if I died and the man that I don't want to marry but helps me raise my children had no money.&nbsp; He deserves $1,000.&nbsp; I said I'd never say wedding vows.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with my privacy preference.&nbsp;    B:&nbsp; I know that.&nbsp; I'd like to help you.&nbsp; Can you hold?    L:&nbsp; The President of the bank, he's good and he's not there anymore, I read the paper you know.&nbsp; I always know what's going on.&nbsp; He told me it was a conversion thing and my Social Security number....    B:&nbsp; Can you hold?    L:&nbsp; The President told me this.&nbsp; I want my money.&nbsp; My man deserves $1,000.&nbsp; He got the advertising.&nbsp; I want it too.&nbsp; I know the answer.&nbsp; It's nothing to do with privacy preferences....    B:&nbsp; Yes, you've told me this MULTIPLE times now.&nbsp; I get it.&nbsp; Can you hold while I try to fix it?    L:&nbsp; The President...    B:&nbsp; Ms. Loudmouth, I can't do anything until you hold.    L:&nbsp; I've been on this call for a long time now  because I just like to hear my own voice.     B:&nbsp; Well, I can make it shorter if you can hold.&nbsp; Can you hold?    L:&nbsp; I've been on this call for almost an hour and I've been dealing with this for 10 years.    B:&nbsp; Can you hold?    L:&nbsp; The President of the bank...    B:&nbsp; Ms. Loudmouth, can you hold?    L:&nbsp; Can you call me back?    B:&nbsp; No.    L:&nbsp; I can hold.     &nbsp;   So at this point (which, by the way, I shortened for the blog.&nbsp; Believe, I shortened it GREATLY.&nbsp; One of the bankers on my team actually took 5 calls in the time it took for me to put this woman on hold.)&nbsp; I called over to a processing area and stumped a whole bunch of people.&nbsp; The first guy just transferred me to someone else.&nbsp; I think he went to ask for help and they just asked to take over the call.&nbsp; This second woman came on and tried to brush me off by giving me a phone number for our privacy preference line.&nbsp; Here's my conversation with her (her name will be Sue.)    S:&nbsp; Here's the phone number for our privacy line.    B:&nbsp; It has nothing to do with her privacy preference.    S:&nbsp; It's probably some conversion thing.    B:&nbsp; That makes no sense.&nbsp;    S:&nbsp; Well, if she opts out, she won't get any paper anymore.    B:&nbsp; But she WANTS the paper.&nbsp; I told you that already.    S:&nbsp; She wants the advertising?&nbsp; That's crazy.    B:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; And she's losing it because we're not flooding her home in dead trees.&nbsp; Is there some type of statement handling code on this account?    S:&nbsp; No.    B:&nbsp; Then why wouldn't she get this in her statements?    S:&nbsp; Well, it's a privacy preference thing.    B:&nbsp; No, it's not.&nbsp; She's getting the stuff in her other statement.&nbsp; If it was a privacy thing, she wouldn't get ANY advertising.&nbsp; And it's not just the advertising.&nbsp; It's the disclosures too.&nbsp;    S:&nbsp; I'll check with a specialist.&nbsp; Can you hold?    B:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Time goes by.&nbsp; Loudmouth actually disconnected so I never got the satisfaction of telling her the CORRECT answer.&nbsp; I don't really care though.&nbsp; She chose to hang up.     &nbsp;   Sue returns.    S:&nbsp; Thanks for holding.&nbsp; I'm still checking on this.&nbsp; The specialist is asking the other specialists for help.&nbsp; Can you continue to hold?    B:&nbsp; Yes.     &nbsp;   Another delay.&nbsp; I'm laughing now because I've stumped the entire department.&nbsp; This is exciting!     &nbsp;   S:&nbsp; Thanks for holding.&nbsp; The reason this woman isn't getting extra advertising is because we only send one per customer and it is generated by whatever account is the first on the customer's profile.    B:&nbsp; So, because her joint account is a lower number than the sole account, the joint account is the one with the advertising?  S:&nbsp; Yes.    B:&nbsp; So, it has nothing to do with her privacy preference and nothing to do with conversions.&nbsp;    S:&nbsp; That's correct.    B:&nbsp; That's good to know.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;    S:&nbsp; Have a good night.     &nbsp;   By the way, if you're not familiar with jargon, joint account means there is more than one signer with transaction authority on the account.&nbsp; Sole account means only one person owns the account.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   The morale of the story:&nbsp; SHUT UP and you'll get the right answer, a lot sooner.&nbsp; Talking or yelling in the ear of a representative does nothing but waste your time and theirs.&nbsp;

      Once upon a time I took a call from a very nice gentleman who had a very traumatic experience and needed to file a claim regarding fraudulent activity on his account.&nbsp; This customer had visited an ATM and was kidnapped at gun point.&nbsp; He was forced to withdraw money from the ATM and then held captive at his home for several days.&nbsp; While I was filing the report, I had to ask him questions for a form I was required to fill out.  &nbsp;  The customer answered my questions and then started providing information I didn't need for the form and didn't really want to know.&nbsp; The italics are when I have&nbsp;quickly pressed the mute button. &nbsp;  I had just asked the customer (C) for a description of the assailant.&nbsp; Here is his response:  &nbsp;  C:&nbsp; There was two of them.&nbsp; They were huge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like football players.&nbsp; I'm just a little guy.&nbsp; They were really big.&nbsp; They were black.&nbsp; Not that there's anything wrong with that, I'm not predjudiced, but these guys were black.&nbsp; They raped me, you know.  DM:&nbsp; Uh, no, I didn't know that.&nbsp; I'm very sorry to hear that, sir.&nbsp; That's horrible.  C:&nbsp; You&nbsp;heard&nbsp;about black men, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;About their really big&nbsp;areas, if you know what I mean.&nbsp; Well, the stories are all true.&nbsp; These guys were huge. DM (rocking back and forth in horror):&nbsp;  Why, why is he telling me this? &nbsp; Oh, sir, I'm so sorry this happened to you.  C:&nbsp; It wouldn't have been so bad if they would have used lubricant.&nbsp; But they didn't.&nbsp; So I didn't like it at all.&nbsp; I wouldn't have minded so much if they would have used some lotion.&nbsp; I might have liked it then.&nbsp; They were really big.&nbsp; I guess you would say they were good looking.&nbsp; DM:&nbsp;  Oh, my God!&nbsp; This is too much information! &nbsp;&nbsp;Have you called the police, sir?  C:&nbsp; I suppose I should do that.&nbsp;  DM:&nbsp; That would be a good idea, sir. &nbsp; Another&nbsp;fraud call came from an older gentleman. &nbsp; DM:&nbsp; Well, I'd be happy&nbsp;to place&nbsp;a freeze on your checking account, sir.&nbsp; We want to make sure that no one can use your account fraudulently. C2:&nbsp; That's good.&nbsp; I appreciate that. DM:&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain what is going to happen to your account...(customer begins talking) C2:&nbsp; See, I'm...well, I was lonely.&nbsp; And I had her over to my apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you&nbsp;know&nbsp;what a one night stand is? DM:&nbsp; Um, yes, sir, I do. C2:&nbsp; I guess I shouldn't have believed that&nbsp;someone that young was interested in me.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;73.&nbsp; How old are you? DM:&nbsp; Okay, sir, I'm going to place a freeze on your account and... C2:&nbsp; I met her at the bar.&nbsp; Did I mention I was lonely?&nbsp; &nbsp;  DM:&nbsp; Okay, well, about this freeze... C2:&nbsp; She was young.&nbsp; She was probably 25 and had a nice, well, chest area. DM:&nbsp;  Oh, dear God in Heaven, where do you people come from?&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I need to place this freeze now.&nbsp; You may want to call the police when we're done. C2:&nbsp; Okay.  &nbsp; The mute button is a wonderful, wonderful invention.

       This story was told to me by a great friend of mine.&nbsp; She is one of the characters and I'm changing the names to protect the guilty.&nbsp; There are three main characters to the story.&nbsp; We have:    Michelle (my friend)    Jim (her ex-boyfriend)    Bart (his best friend)     &nbsp;   Michelle and Jim shared an apartment.&nbsp; Life was happy, nothing too terrible going on, but as life goes, drama must occur.&nbsp; Michelle worked hard at her job, pulling double shifts often to pull in the money and Jim had his steady job.&nbsp; Michelle came home from work one night, not quite ready to hit the sack where Jim was sleeping peacefully.&nbsp; What to do?&nbsp; She decided it was time to write in her journal so she quietly went into their room and pulled her journal and a pen from her dresser drawer.     &nbsp;   "What's that?"&nbsp; Jim sleepily asks.     &nbsp;   "It's my journal.&nbsp; I'm going to the living room.&nbsp; Go back to sleep."&nbsp;     &nbsp;   She goes to the living room and sits watching music videos and writing about her day, venting about customers and the jerk who cut her off, you know, meaningless stuff.&nbsp; Her writing is personal to her though, and anyone reading her journal would be invading her privacy.&nbsp; As she is done, she thinks, "He's going to read my journal.&nbsp; I know it."&nbsp; She pulls a hair from her head, lays it across the page and tests her trick.&nbsp; The hair won't fall out unless the journal is opened.&nbsp; Now she'll know.     &nbsp;   The next day is rather uneventful.&nbsp; Jim has the day off and Michelle leaves for work.&nbsp; She works a double shift again and comes home to see Jim sitting in the living room, flipping through the channels.&nbsp; She goes to their room quickly and checks the journal.&nbsp; Sure enough, the hair is missing.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Michelle walks back into the living room to face Jim.&nbsp; "So what did you do today?"&nbsp; She asks nicely.     &nbsp;   "Not much.&nbsp; Just sat around watching TV."&nbsp; Jim replies.     &nbsp;   "What time did you read my journal?"&nbsp; She is still giving him a chance to answer honestly.     &nbsp;   "I didn't read your journal."     &nbsp;   "I didn't ask if you read my journal, I asked what TIME did you read my journal."     &nbsp;   "I didn't read your journal."&nbsp; He lies again.     &nbsp;   "Well, I worked a long day, and you're lying to me, I'm going to bed."     &nbsp;   Michelle is not someone you want mad at you.&nbsp; I learned everything I know about arguing from her.&nbsp; I've seen her boyfriends cringe in the corner of a room, scared of the logic and vicious rhetoric she uses.&nbsp; And the daggers from her eyes!&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; I'm in awe every time I see her in full action.&nbsp; Jim got lucky that night.     &nbsp;   The next night Michelle goes to work again and goes out afterwards, 'forgetting' to turn off her cell phone.&nbsp; She's avoiding Jim for the time being to avoid saying something she doesn't want to.&nbsp; This goes on for a couple of days.     &nbsp;   On Friday, Jim calls her at work.&nbsp; During her shift.&nbsp; Here's the conversation:     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Hello.     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; I need you to turn on your phone tonight.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Tell me why.     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; I just need you to turn on your phone.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Tell me why.     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; Just do it.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Tell me why!     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; I might need a little help.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; What?     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; I might need to call you.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Why?     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; Bart asked me to take his truck.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; So?     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; He wants me to TAKE his truck.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Don't do it.     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; Just turn on your phone.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; I can't believe you're planning on insurance fraud.     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; Just turn on your phone.     &nbsp;   She hangs up on him.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Michelle continues her shift at work and now we start to see what Jim is up to.     &nbsp;   The idiot decided to take Bart's truck.&nbsp; He did it.&nbsp; The plan is for Jim to take the truck, Bart to come pick up Jim in his girlfriend's car, and then call in a stolen vehicle report.&nbsp; I guess Bart couldn't pay NABABNA anymore for the truck and wanted out of the deal.&nbsp; Jim held up to his end of the bargain.&nbsp; He took the truck up to an abandoned field and torched the vehicle.&nbsp; I mean torched it.&nbsp; He actually did a good job of arson.&nbsp; There is no way this vehicle can be repaired.&nbsp; As he's leaving the scene, he lost his cell phone.&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; He lost his cell phone.&nbsp; Now he can't call Bart to get him.&nbsp; Bart knows where he is, this isn't a big deal.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Bart's girlfriend gets pissed off at him and takes off in her car.&nbsp; Bart cannot go get Jim.&nbsp; He has already called in the stolen vehicle report and is now frantically trying to find another buddy to give him a ride to go get Jim without giving up the story.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   After about 10 calls, he finds a ride and gets Jim.&nbsp; The plan works.&nbsp; Amazingly enough, up to this point, the plan is working.&nbsp; The boys get back to the house and the police call.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Police:&nbsp; We found your truck.&nbsp; We have some bad news.&nbsp; It's been torched.     &nbsp;   Bart:&nbsp; Oh man.     &nbsp;   Police:&nbsp; Did you lose your cell phone?     &nbsp;   Bart:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I have my phone.     &nbsp;   Police:&nbsp; We found a phone near the truck.     &nbsp;   Bart:&nbsp; You know, my buddy was riding with me earlier today.&nbsp; Maybe he left it in the truck.     &nbsp;   Police:&nbsp; That makes sense.&nbsp; We filled out the report and you can contact your insurance company.     &nbsp;   Bart:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   They hang up.&nbsp; Again, the plan is working.&nbsp; The police actually bought the story about the cell phone and Bart is clear.&nbsp; They should have left it here.&nbsp; But what happens?&nbsp; Bart and Jim get paranoid.&nbsp; Bart starts freaking out and Jim does nothing to stop this.&nbsp; Bart decides to call the police back.     &nbsp;   Bart:&nbsp; I want to cancel my stolen vehicle report.     &nbsp;   Police:&nbsp; Why?     &nbsp;   Bart:&nbsp; I asked my friend to take my truck.     &nbsp;   Police:&nbsp; Okay.     &nbsp;   Bart:&nbsp; Can he have his cell phone back?     &nbsp;   Police:&nbsp; Sure, why don't you boys come on down to the station and we'll give it back.     &nbsp;   Bart:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Thanks!     &nbsp;   Here's the idiot part.&nbsp; Bartles and James go to the police station.&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; The drive to the station to pick up the phone.&nbsp; When they walk in, they confess to everything and Jim uses his one call to call Michelle.     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; I'm in jail.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Good.     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; Can you call my mom and arrange bail?     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Yes.     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; It's Friday night.&nbsp; I can't get out until Monday morning.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Good.     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Bye.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Bye.     &nbsp;   Monday morning arrives and Michelle arrives at the police station with Jim's mom to get him out of jail.&nbsp; His mother gives him the classic lecture and then leaves.&nbsp; Michelle is left standing with Jim, fuming at the idiot for screwing up his life and hers.&nbsp; Her response to him was:     &nbsp;   "So, when did you read my journal?"     &nbsp;   Jim lowers his head, knowing he is defeated.&nbsp; There is no out anymore.&nbsp; "Okay, I read your journal.&nbsp; I'm sorry."     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Alright, now we can deal with everything else.&nbsp; Why, WHY would you do this to me?     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; I didn't do this to you.     &nbsp;   M:&nbsp; Oh, oh yes you did.&nbsp; I'm counting on you to pay half the rent and I'm planning on spending my life with you, why, why would you do this to me?     &nbsp;   J:&nbsp; Whatever.     &nbsp;   Needless to say, Michelle and Jim broke up.&nbsp; He did try three weeks later to mend things by saying, "You should be over this by now."&nbsp; Not a good thing to say to Michelle.&nbsp; Especially after he threatened to kill her cat.&nbsp; He turned a little bit psycho.&nbsp; Jim and Bart both went in front of a judge and got their punishment.&nbsp; Jim moved out and Michelle's life is back to normal.&nbsp; Or as close as it can get.&nbsp;

      In honor of Fraud Prevention Week (well, in belated honor of Fraud Prevention Week), I thought posts on the different types of fraud might be a good idea.  And, in order to amuse, examples of the types of fraud will be offset with the morons who knew they were the victims of fraud and yet, didn't want to do anything about it.  Why?  Well, I thought I covered that when I said they were morons but okay, because they were stupid?  Today's post is about Check Fraud - Most people aren't aware that there is actually a black market for checking account numbers.  I know this because a) I watch 20/20 on occasion and b) I work in a bank.  It would stand to reason that I know what I'm talking about, right?   So, when your bank representative tells you that, since your checking account information is stolen, it would be a good idea to close your account, please listen.  I have spent many hours trying to convince customers of this.   Conversation with elderly woman.  DM:  Thank you for holding, ma'am.  My name is Dana and I'm a supervisor with NABABNA.  I understand your check book is missing but you don't want to close your account. Elderly Woman (EW):  That's right. DM:  Might I ask why? EW:  Because I got new checks.  Talk to my daughter.  (She hands the phone to her daughter) DM:  Hi.  I'm Dana.  Your mother wanted me to talk to you but unfortunately, I can't speak to you about her account.  I can, however, answer general questions. Overbearing Daughter (OD):  I think it's just ridiculous that NABABNA is forcing my mother to close my account.  She just bought $100 worth of new checks and now, you're forcing her to close this account and lose that $100. DM:  Okay.  I can understand how that... OD:  You're just doing this to make money.  I know how NABABNA works.  You're money hungry.  You figure that you'll make the customer have to order checks all over again and get another $100. DM:  I'm sorry you feel that way.  I wouldn't like you to feel that we are money hungry, we are simply trying to protect your mother's account from fraud.  OD:  Oh, please.  What could possibly happen if someone found her checkbook?  DM:  I'm glad you asked.  Here are some things that can happen.     I quickly give the customer and her daughter an example of all the things that can happen when your checkbook is stolen, such as the previously mentioned black market.  How just placing a stop payment on lost or stolen checks is not always enough because there are software programs that can be used to print checks at home.  How automatic payments can be set up using the stolen number.  How a stop payment only lasts for six months and sometimes the thiefs will wait until the six months is up and then start running the checks through.   OD:  You're just trying to scare us. DM:  Ma'am, could I please speak to your mother? EW:  Yes? DM:  Ms. Elderly Woman, your daughter thinks I am just trying to scare you.  However, what I'm trying to is protect your account.  You have $25,000 in this checking account.  If someone was to use your account in a fraudulent matter and you refuse to place the freeze on your account, you could be held responsible for the fraud.  I certainly think that the thought of losing $25,000 is much more serious than the fact that you just ordered checks for $100.  EW:  But they're really pretty checks.  They have kittens on them. DM:  (On mute, making the universally recognized weighing balance gesture with my hands)   Kitten checks...$25,000.  Kitten checks...$25,000.  Yeah, lady, you're right.  Save the kitten checks, that's so much more practical.   I understand that, ma'am.  I really think that $25,000 is a little more important. EW:  You're right.  Let's do this.  I go through the entire freeze process with the customer.  Between her and her daughter, there are a myriad of questions about every single aspect of the freeze.  This procedure normally takes 15 minutes, at the most.  Keep in mind I'd already spent a good 15 minutes convincing Ms. Elderly Woman that this was a good idea.  With all of the questions they were asking, another 45 minutes have passed.  I have spent an hour helping save all of this woman's money and I feel good about it.  I've done a good deed.  I am Super Banker.  Until I hear this...  EW:  Uh-oh. DM:  Excuse me? EW:  (Giggles)  I hope you won't be too mad at me. DM:  I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean. EW:  Oh, my daughter just found my checkbook.  It was in my other purse.  Sorry. DM:  (Through my clenched teeth)  Oh, that's wonderful.  Let me delete this freeze for you.  I'm glad you found your checkbook. EW:  Thank you.  Have a nice day.   And she is gone, off to spend her $25,000 with her brand new kitten checks.  Stupid woman.  What is our moral today?  If you're going to call the bank to report your checkbook stolen, make sure it's actually stolen.   If you have two purses, check them both!   Some of the places where customers have found their checkbook after placing a freeze:   Behind the toilet (why, I always balance my checkbook in the bathroom).  Underneath the bed (the cover is leather and the guy's cat had stolen the checkbook to play with it).  In their locked drawer at work (because, hey, why would I bother to look there when it's the place I always put my checkbook).   I know there are more but I can't think of them right now.  Beth and Keem will remind me of anything I've missed.

       Paperwork can sometimes be an inspiration. I was cleaning up my desk at work and came across a file of situations that were too unique to put aside forever. Sometimes they were customers I spent a long time talking to, sometimes the files in here are for customers with massive amounts of fraud or extremely complex situations, and then, sometimes the customers just say things that are, in a word, INSANE. There are quite a few different situations listed here and they are all a little bit different. Enjoy!      The first file I ran across tonight was for a woman I spoke to over 3 1/2 years ago. I will always remember her. Especially since she didn't actually bank with NABABNA, but thought she did. She never opened an account, never made deposits, never had any type of card for her non-existent accounts, but she BELIEVED that she might bank with us. I tried desperately to help her. The best part of the conversation is as follows:    Disenchanted Woman (DW): I need proof of my deposits into your bank.   B (me!): I am more than happy to help you if in fact you did actually bank with us. I'm trying to find any information about you in our systems. What is your Social Security number?   DW: 123-45-6789  (it was different than this, but I can't release information like that).    B: I tried that number and nothing pulls up.   DW: Well, that's my fake Social Security number. Of course you won't find anything.   B: Then why did you provide that number to me?   DW: In case you had it.   B: What is your real Social Security number?   DW: I'm not giving that out. I hate 60 Minutes. You know, the TV show. I hate it. And that dog for the RCA commercials.    B: Why won't you give our your Social Security number so I can see if you actually banked with us? I'm sorry that you don't like the dog on RCA commercials and that you don't like 60 Minutes.   DW: I was beat up by the Secret Service at LAX. They were looking for a white collar case. They strip-searched me. Then the police in Texas beat me up at the bank. The campus police beat me up and there's a statute of limitation.   B: I'm sorry to hear that.  Police don't just beat people up. I know this is hard to believe, but they don't just walk around and start hitting people. What did you do?     DW: Those people at the bank were mean to me and made the police beat me up.   B: My experience is that the branch will call the police if there is a problem, but they don't ask the police to beat people up. What happened?   DW: I'm not talking about that. Do you have my information? B: No, I would like to look with your  real  Social Security number.   DW: I'm not giving you that. How come you can't find my information? B: As of this time, you've provided me with your first name and a  fake  Social Security number. You said you might have banked with us sometime over 5 years ago, but you're not sure. Do you have any information I can look you up by? DW: I spoke to Jackie 3 years ago. She works for another company.   B: What?   DW: I called you because I want to talk to your head office.    B: But the head office is no where near here.   DW: Well, then I can talk to you.   B: Okay, about what exactly?   DW: About Wal-Mart of course.   B: Did Wal-Mart do something to your account?   DW: No.   B: Then there's no reason to talk to the bank about Wal-Mart.      Well, needless to say, this woman went on for over 2 hours about random things. She's been beaten up by many different law enforcement officers apparently and she never did actually bank with us. I'm still trying to figure out why a person would have a fake Social Security number. And why they would give it out when they haven't used it before.    When there is a problem (real or perceived), it is always more efficient to be helpful and polite to the representative helping you. Being difficult when a representative says they will help you only wastes your time.     One night I spoke with a gentleman who was not happy with the price of checks. Here's the deal, we don't really come up with the prices. An outside vendor prints our checks and for the quality of the checks, the price is worth it.     The guy had been a great customer so I told him I would reverse the fee for the checks as an exception. That's right, I told him he didn't have to pay. I gave him his request. Was he happy?    It would not be a good story if he was. I asked the gentleman for his phone number to complete the request. He spent 40, that's right folks, 40 minutes telling me that he would not give me his phone number. He said I already had it and that he didn't need to give it out. Unfortunately, if there is a problem and I need to call him back, I need him to actually tell me the number. I explained, politely, that I would be unable to reverse the fee without the phone number. He still wouldn't verify the number.     What does he start on now? He starts complaining about inflation and that the bank should give him an interest-free loan because the United States of America has inflation. Okay, let's break this down. Inflation is a fact of life. Alan Greenspan works very hard with interest rates trying to keep our economy alive and trying to keep inflation from rising. Money does lose value. This is a fact of life. All people have to deal with inflation. This is not his own personal problem.     Here's the other thing, loans are not interest free. The cost of using someone else's money is expensive and that is where interest comes in. Since you are borrowing the money from someone, they are unable to use it. That means the bank (or individual) cannot spend those funds on products/services, or invest the funds somewhere else. Interest-free loans do not happen.     So, the guy finally gives me his phone number. And then he asks for compensation for the last forty minutes of his time. At this point, I explained that I asked him forty minutes ago for his phone number and it was his choice to make the phone call last as long as it did. Sad to say, the customer was not pleased with the fact I wouldn't give him free money. I gave him free checks and I still don't understand his problem.    Automated Teller Machines    In this day and age, technology is jumping forward in leaps and bounds. You can use a card to access your account pretty much any time of day. Unfortunately, some people don't understand how to use an ATM. Here are some brief calls we've received at NABABNA about the ATM transactions:    Really, really drunk man (RRDM): Your machine wouldn't give me money! I gotta pay my tab.    Me: I'm happy to help. Let's troubleshoot the problem. Where in the transaction did the machine deny the transaction?    RRDM: It didn't work and didn't give me money.    Me: Did you get a message before or after you put in your personal identification number?    RRDM: Before.    Me: Okay, so you put your card in the machine and it denied the transaction right then?    RRDM: You have to put your card in the machine?     No, the machine is psychic. You can just walk up and it starts spitting money at you. What? Please, please tell me you have a designated driver.     Mr. Fix-It (FI): I have a problem.    Me: I'd like to help you out. What happened?    FI: Well, I went to the ATM to make a deposit and I put the envelope with my check in the card slot.     Me:  How did you make it fit?  And it's stuck now?    FI: Yes. I need my deposit.    Me: I can file a claim and call our support area to report the broken machine.    FI: Well, I went home and got the pliers, but I still can't get the envelope back out.    Me: Um, let me file the claim and in the future, please don't try to open an ATM without being a bank employee.    Whinny Woman (WW): My deposit is missing.    Me: How did you make the deposit?    WW: Well, I didn't really make it.    Me: How is it missing then?    WW: On the way to the ATM, I dropped my check in the crack.    Me: In the sidewalk?    Turns out, the woman didn't drop the check. She forced it into the slot between the machine and the wall because she somehow thought that's where it went. Then she realized that there's a spot for deposits and it's actually on the machine.    And technology has gone too far. There are now machines that have options for visually impaired individuals, which is a great thing. These customers have headphones and can listen to the machine if they have troubles seeing the screen. Here's the guy who picked this option and should not have:    Mr. I-Can't-Handle-My-Money (ICHMM): I used one of those speaking machines and it embarrassed me!    Me: I'm sorry about that sir. Did you use the headphones?    ICHMM: No. I'm not blind.     Me: Okay. Why did you select the talking option?    ICHMM: I wanted to see what happened.    Me: The machine talked to you then?    ICHMM: Yes, it took my card and this computer voice loudly stated, "Your card has been detained!" I'm so embarrassed. I want my card back.    Me: Unfortunately, your account was not handled properly and the card is ultimately the property of the bank. I am unable to get you a new card.     ICHMM: Your card has been detained! Your card has been detained! ( Yes, he kept imitating the computer voice)  I hate you people! Your card has been detained! Dial tone.....    Back to silly calls that don't involve ATMs:    This call was from a man (Would Benefit from Anger Management (WBFAM)) whose account was closed due to threats at the bank.     Me: Thank you for holding Mr. WBFAM. My name is Beth. How can I help you?    WBFAM: That's a weird name for a girl. Your name is really strange.    Long pause. This is me sitting is stunned silence. Maybe I'm biased, but Beth is not an unusual name. It's not as common as Jennifer or Kim, but it's not unusual. Whatever.    Me: How can I help you?    WBFAM: The people at your bank followed all the regulations passed by Congress and I'm pissed off.    Me: I want to understand. You are upset that the bank employees followed the law?    WBFAM: Yes. I wanted to do a whole bunch of investment fraud and they wouldn't let me.    Me: The bank wouldn't let you commit fraud and this upsets you?    WBFAM: I'm going to give your company $100,000 in bad publicity because you followed the law! These are bogus laws!     Me: Sir, if you do not agree with the laws passed by the Federal government, I suggest speaking with your Congressman or an attorney.     WBFAM: The line in the bank was too long. There were 100 people in line and only two people working. There were two people on break. I was in line for an hour and fifteen minutes!    This is where he hung up. Here's the question I have. How is it bad publicity to have a customer go to the press stating the bank did not break the law? Also, how would he know if two people were on break if they weren't in the bank? I've worked in branches before. I've never seen 100 people in line. I don't think I've ever seen a line that lasted more than 10 minutes.     Here's another long line story (that I will honestly say I don't believe):    Insane Woman (IW): I went to the bank. I was in line for over an hour. The line was so long, I had to take a taxi to get through it.  (What? How do you take a taxi inside a bank?)  While I was getting into the taxi, someone ran over my suitcase! Can you believe that? Someone ran over my suitcase!  (Why, why, why did you bring a suitcase to the bank? What is the purpose of that? It's not like you can camp there. No one goes, hey, I'm on vacation, I think I'll check out a room at the bank and sightsee. What was this woman on?)     And finally, one of the scariest calls I've ever received. I didn't actually get to talk during this call, the gentleman just started on a rant and then hung up. This call did involve contacting security and the shut down of this person's account. Believe me, threatening the lives of bank employees, other customers, or yourself is not something that is taken lightly by the bank. Here's the call:    Upset man: I'm bi-polar and my medication makes me tired. I fell asleep on the bus and someone stole my ATM card. I want to get the money from my account but I don't have a card and the nearest bank is over 3 hours away. I want to have my money now and you need to give it to me. I'm going to write to Reader's Digest and expose NABABNA for following the rules. I lived in DC with this guy before who took advantage of me because of my mental illness. I left there and moved in with this woman in [deleted state] who I thought I loved but she also took advantage of me and laughed at me. She stole my money and she had another guy move in and he wears my clothes. I spent last night at a homeless shelter and I haven't had an address for three months now but your employees should track me down and give me my statements. I am going to kill someone at your bank if you don't get me my money right now.     And that's when he hung up. All of this was over $12. That's right. Twelve dollars. He was serious that the bank should be able to make twelve dollars appear in his hands immediately. Luckily, the man was three hours away from the nearest branch but we still took all precautions. People like this scare me. Threatening others is not something that is beneficial or allowed. My advice to him (and many others that we've dealt with at work) is to think before you speak.

       On occasion, I have answered the phone to have a slightly hysterical banker on the line. The banker is hysterical because their customer has turned a simple transaction, such as getting a balance, into dialogue for a pornographic movie.  Now, the sad thing about this is that, dude, we're your bank. We have your account information, we have your name and we know where you live. Why, why would you call us when there are so many other places you could call anonymously? Hey, I've got an idea. Next time, skip the bank. Call the police and start harassing them. Avoid the middle man. Because, you moron, do you really think we're going to just sit there and say "Oh, yes, sir, it's so sexy when you say those words to me. What a turn on!" If you do, you are dumber than we already think.  Here are just some examples of things people will say (my remarks are in italics, as usual):     "Can you go through my account? I want to know all of the checks that have cleared my account in the last 90 days." Banker begins reading information off to customer. "Oh, yeah. Would you read that slower? Ooh." Banker hears noises that you don't normally hear during a phone call. Sounds involving lotion and friction. Then there's a low moan. "Okay, thanks. You can stop now. You've been very helpful."  Can I just say "Eew?"       "You have an accent. What nationality are you?" Banker informs the customer that she is Chinese. "Ooh, are you a hot Chinese chick? You suckee long time?"  Oh, yes, let's meet now! I'm so turned on by your stereotypical remark that I can't wait to meet you!       Sometimes the customer gets really intelligent and starts mentioning random words such as "P*ssy" or "C*ck."  Oh, mister, I love animals as well. Let's have some barnyard fun. I'll call you Jackass.       "What is your name? How do you spell that? Is that S as in Sex?"  Yes, sir, that's exactly what my mother had in mind when she named me.        "You are really nice. May I have your phone number so I can have my son call you? He needs to date a nice girl. If he did, maybe he'd get a job and move out of the house.  You know, I was just telling my friends the other day that what I was really looking for was an unemployed guy who lives with his parents. That's my Prince Charming!       When the banker ignores the customer's inappropriate remarks and tries to keep the call on a professional level, the customer says "Oh, I'm sorry. Don't be mad at me. I'm being a dick. I'm a big dick."  Sounds like someone thinks a bit highly about themselves...if you were such a big dick, maybe you could find an actual date?       The customer has called in and filed five separate research tickets. On the same item. In one hour. Turned out that he was calling in for other reasons which were revealed when he started moaning when a banker started reading off a reference number. It turned out that this customer called in 30 times a day.  Yes, sir, reference numbers make me hot as well. Let's read it together...12345678. Oh, baby, oh baby, oh. You stud.       About 15 years ago, I used to work for this submarine shop. Now, this, perverts of America, is the type of place you want to call. You can just dial a random number and harass away (please, please don't take me seriously. Calls can be traced, it is illegal to make obscene and harassing phone calls, just go and buy yourself some porn, okay?). We used to get calls every night, on the hour. I will never forget my first night.    The phone rings. I answer the phone.    DM: Thank you for calling The Sub Shop. This is Dana, may I take your order? Ham Sandwich Guy (Ham): Yes, I would like to visit your fine establishment and partake of a submarine sandwich. DM: Wonderful, sir. We'd be happy to have you visit us tonight. Ham: But wait, before I can come down there, I must ask you a question. DM: Okay. Ham: What type of ham sandwiches do you have? DM: Why we have a ham and cheese submarine sandwich, a Hot Ham and Cheese sandwich and also a ham salad sandwich. Ham: My, those sound yummy (swear to God, this is how this guy talked). DM: Yes, they are very good. May I start an order for you? Ham: Oh, well, before I can visit you, I must ask you. Do you have any girls working there tonight with long hair? DM: Um, actually, we all have long hair, sir. But we do wear hair nets (and really exciting brown derby hats as well). Ham: Oh, no. I'm afraid of women with long hair. DM: What? Ham: Oh, but, I might be able to get over my fear. Are any of you wearing sweaters? DM: It's January. In Minnesota (and our owner is too cheap to get the heating fixed). Yes, we are wearing sweaters. Ham: Oh, that's too bad. I'm afraid of women with long hair but I'm terrified of women with long hair in sweaters. I won't be able to come in tonight. Goodbye.  I just stand there, staring blankly at the phone. The assistant manager walks by. "What's wrong?" she asks. I start my sentence with "I just got the weirdest call about ham sandwiches" and she starts laughing. And then tells me he's relatively harmless. It's the other ones I have to watch out for.  And she's right. While working there, I was flashed, propositioned, threatened, learned how to ask someone to go to bed with me in French and had a fairly interesting time. The obscene phone calls came nightly. You learned how to deal with them and just went on with your life. Because the owner was too cheap to put a trace on the phone as well.  Here's another fairly memorable example:  DM: Thank you for calling The Sub Shop. This is Dana, may I take your order? Random Pervert (RP): What type of hot sandwiches do you have? DM: I'd be happy to help you with that, sir. We offer a Hot Ham and Cheese, a Meatball Sub, a really weird sandwich with black and green olives (don't remember the name of the sub).   RP: Oh, well, I have a really hot and juicy Italian sausage I'd like to sell you. Are you interested in hot and juicy Italian sausages? DM (tired and cranky and I have 8 real customers in the store): I'm sorry, sir. But all orders must be placed through the office. Here is their number. Maybe they will be interested in your hot and juicy Italian sausage.  I hang up the phone. I walk back up front to wait on my actual customers. And every single one of them is looking at me dumbfounded. We all have a good laugh at the random pervert's expense. And this really nice guy answered the phone for the next 15 minutes because random pervert was ticked off and kept calling back. Finally, the really nice guy introduced himself to random pervert. "Yes, sir, this is Officer Mike Johnson from the Saint Paul Police Department. Please stop calling or I will have this call traced."  So when you call me and ask me to read your bank information to you slowly, all I have to say is "Honey, I've dealt with better and more creative perverts than you. Get a life. And look into getting a new account, because yours is going to be closed."

      Look, if you're going to buy a house, there's going to be some things you need to know. I don't know much about the whole mortgage thing but, working for NABABNA, there has been some things that I have discovered. And I will give you this list now, because I am a nice person and quite frankly, I am getting sick and tired of people calling me the day before their closing and asking for statements for the last year.  When you approach the mortgage people, ask them exactly what you will need for your closing or any other random things they might want. They will lie. They probably don't mean to lie but they will. They will ask you for some things and tell you that's all they need and, at the very last minute, they will say "Oh, by the way, we need photocopies of a check you wrote 3 years ago. Just for fun, let's say it has to start with the number 5 and be written to a cable company. Because we're just evil bastards." Okay, they probably don't say they are evil bastards.   But they are.  Trust me on this.  I've never bought a house but, from working in the Call Center for NABABNA, I have come across some odd requests. Here are some things you may want to have on hand before you even go to apply for the mortgage, let alone have a closing date.  Oh, and for the record, it goes without saying that you will need your last 12 statements. And the last 12 rent checks you wrote out. Be smart, ask for photocopies early. Do not be one of these people (This is an example of one of probably 30 calls I have received over this):  DM: I'm sorry, sir, I understand that you are closing today. However, while I would be happy to order your photocopies, I cannot guarantee that you will receive them in one hour. Time Challenged Moron (TC): But you're my baaaaaannnk (Yes, he actually wailed. I thought I was talking to a 12 year old for a moment)! You have to get me this! DM: I'm sorry, sir. It is impossible for me to get these photocopies in one hour. TC: Well, you better! I'm going to lose my house and it will be all your fault! DM: May I ask, sir, when did you know you would need these photocopies? TC: Three months ago. Why? DM: I see. And it didn't occur to you to contact us earlier? TC: Well, I'm busy! I am a powerful person!  I am Zeus, the All-Powerful  (okay, remember, italics for the customer are what I think he wants to say, not what he actually did)! Get me my copies! I want you to go to the warehouse and get them! DM: Sir. It is not possible for me to go to a warehouse and get these copies for you. They are on microfiche and will be retrieved by our Photo Unit. I have placed the order. The request will be completed tomorrow and please allow 3-5 days for delivery. TC: Do you know who I am? I am going to call So-and-So (names someone I have never heard of but, when I later look up in the employee database, discover he is talking about the District Manager for 3 branches halfway across the country. Ooh. Scary) and have you fired (He hangs up). DM: Thank you for calling NABABNA, sir. I am sorry I was unable to assist you further.  Here are some of the things your mortgage company might also ask you for, waiting until the last minute:    Copies of checks you wrote to them for earnest money   Copies of checks you wrote to someone to repair the home you are moving out of to prove that you actually did do the repairs   Copies of statements that have your name on it (if you are on a joint account and have known for 2 years that your name is not showing up on the statement but your wife's is, do not call us the day before your closing and ask us to fix it. We can't)   It's not that we don't want to help you. It's just that my magic wand broke and I can't will these things into existence. And it doesn't help when the mortgage company rep gets on the line and starts screaming "Well, you're a bank! You should be able to get this stuff for the customer! They're going to lose the home!" I always want to scream back "Well, you're a mortgage company! You should have told the customer they needed this stuff two months ago! And you don't care if they lose the home, you care that you're going to lose your comission!"

       Did you know that....      Writing a check to yourself from your overdrawn account and then depositing that check into the same account at an atm that that is considered kiting from your own account and your account will be closed?  (customer response: Oh, I guess I shouldn't have done that...  ya think? )      Statements are sent out by the bank to help you balance your account? (yes, there are people in the world that truly don't know what a statement is)      Just because there is a commercial on TV telling you that if you travel and only bring your check card with you that that doesn't mean the bank can help you if your card is lost or possibly closed without your knowledge?  (Unfortunately, your card can be closed at any time and it is only one way to access your account.  It is not the bank's fault if you only bring your check card with you as your only means of payment)      That the bank is not 411?  (we do not have the number to another bank of your choosing, your local police department, etc.)      If you don't balance your statements for years and there is an unauthorized charge, the bank cannot dispute anything older than 6 months?  Here's my conversation with Mr. X:      Mr. X:  I just balanced my account statements for the last 9 years.  I have unauthorized debits from Company A.     K:  Well, Mr. X, I would be happy to file a claim for you.  Unfortunately, I would only be able to go back 6 months.   Mr. X:  You don't understand!  I didn't authorize this charge!  I cancelled my subscription 9 years ago.  They have no right to take out this money.  They have been charging me $50.00 a month for the last 9 years.  You are my bank!  You have to fix this and get my money back.   K:  I would love to help you get all of your money back Mr. X, however, I am unable to dispute anything over 6 months.  Why haven't you been balancing your account on a monthly basis?   Mr. X:  I don't worry about my account as I have plenty of money.  I don't have to balance my account every month.  You need to fix this.  I want my money back.   K:  Well Mr. X, I can file a claim on the last 6 months of transactions that are unauthorized.  For anything older than that, please contact Company A.     (at this point the conversation is stuck in a loop)      Moral of this story:  Always balance your account and check your statements or you could be out $5,400.00 too.        **all information above based loosely on actual conversation with the customer.      Now to continue on with more fun while working at the convenience store....      I eventually got tired of managing a convenience store and started managing a Tobacco Outlet.  That was interesting as I am not even a smoker.  Funny thing is that I actually created training material on Cigars to be used in our stores for co-workers to assist customers.  Occasionally, I would have a break in in the middle of the night.  This isn't specifically what people said, but more what they did.      #1.  At one point, the power had gone out in my store, actually the entire neighborhood was without power due to severe weather.  I came into work the next day and called the home office about the power outage.  They were asking for it by telling me to put a sign on the door saying "Closed due to Power Outage."  Keep in mind that there was a security system in the store.  It has battery back-up, but it only lasted for 24 hours.  Can you imagine what happened?  The jerks took a metal cutter and cut around the dead-bolt in the door.  Pulled the door free and took merchandise and cigs.  Hmmm...think that one might have been a little inviting?  I should have put up a sign that says "Battery back-up only lasts 24 hours..come back at midnight if you want to steal anything..you'll be in the clear."      #2.  If you are trying to shoplift, don't stand in the middle of the store in plain view and put a carton of cigs in the sleeve of your coat and then deny it when I have it on tape.      #3.  If you are going to be intelligent enough to attempt to shoplift, don't make it obvious by walking directly into the shelf to grab some Swisher Sweets and tell me that you have to go outside and talk to your girlfriend.  Didn't work did it?      I have to say that it was definitely fun to work there.  I'll have to blog the shoplifting and break ins on my other blog.  I'm just not doing that fast to irritate Dana.  :)  Hee hee.

       The following story is based on actual events. I wouldn't say that it would necessarily warrant calling the people involved morons, however, the customers in the store could very possibly qualify for the title. Prior to working at NABABNA, I worked for a convenience store. The great thing is that I can say anything I want to about it. Trust me, I have tons of material that would fit. I just have to have the time to actually write it. I hope you enjoy the first installment.      Imagine being the manager of this store. It is in a very, very unsafe neighborhood (had I realized it at the time, I probably wouldn't have chosen that particular store). The store had video cameras, however, you weren't able to see the entire store on any given camera. Knowing this, it will explain how this actually happened. If you are going into the back room of the store and find someone (who doesn't actually work there, by the way) in the back room, wouldn't you think it was odd if it happened more than one day in a row? Here's the conversation I had with the manager:      Scott: Keem, you aren't going to believe what happened at my store!   Keem: Well, Scott, considering where the store is located, I'm sure this is going to be good. What happened?   Scott: Okay, so I walked into the back room on Monday and found a customer wandering around back there. I asked him what he was doing and he told me he was looking for the restroom. I didn't really think much of it at the time, but I told him it was on the other side of the store.   Keem: Interesting. Kinda makes it easy for someone to go into the back room when the door doesn't actually lock (but then it's hard when it's a revolving door, I guess ).    Scott: On Tuesday I found the same guy in the back room again. I did think it was strange this time. He didn't have a good excuse this time.    Keem: (at this point I'm just trying to figure out what this is leading up to ...)    Scott: So imagine my surprise when I came to work yesterday and was shocked to find that the TV was missing from the back room.   Keem: OMG Scott! How could that happen? It's not like we do TV repair or anything. Didn't anyone say anything? Did you see anything on the store video?   Scott: You have to see the video. When you are done at your store, come on by and watch this.   Keem: Okay Scott. I'll be there in a little bit.      At this point, I arrive at the store and am kind of curious how someone could get a TV out of the back room of the store and walk it right out the front door without anyone seeing or saying anything.       Before explaining the video, I'll explain how the store looks. The store is set up so that it's pretty much a rectangle. If facing the back of the store from the front, customers enter on your right. There are three rows of shelves split so that there are actually six sections. There are windows on the right side after the doors and the bathrooms are in the back on the right wall. On the left are the cooler/freezer doors and the back room door after the freezer. This is the basic set up of the store. You'd think that it would be easy to see everything from the register. However, the person at the register has to see past the rather large computer monitor that is the display for the register..I'm not talking small either. I would say that they are about 17" monitors. If you can see past the monitor, there are 2 banana trees beyond that (a banana tree is a display that has bananas stacked on the top, bread below that, bins for specials below the bread and then pop or other items stacked under that).       Now we settle in our chairs to watch the video unfold. There are 4 cameras in the store that show the view of the registers up front, the coffee bar, the front doors and down the first aisle by the cooler/freezer doors. We see 5 men (so as not to stereotype, I'll withhold and further details) standing by the freezer. Then there were 4. It was hard to see where the 5th man went as they were rather obviously standing around the back room door. Hmmmm...I wonder what he could possibly be doing. So the next thing you know, there he is holding this rather large, black, box-like object. This store is extremely busy at this point...can't anyone see what is going on? The 4 men proceed to block the 5th man with the TV. At this point they move to their left (my right) and they go off camera. I, at this point, am imagining the Flinstone tippy-toe effect. I can see them going from the end of one aisle to the next hiding behind the end caps. After about 5 minutes we see them march right up the aisle by the windows and right out the doors. Not a single person stopped them. Not one!       I almost fall out of my chair after seeing this.       Keem: Scott! How could Heather and Don not see this at all?!?   Scott: I have no idea! I would have seen this.    Keem: Why didn't customers see it? It's not like we do TV repair. Wouldn't you think it was odd to see 5 men carrying a TV and trying to be inconspicuous about it?    Scott: I can't figure it out. Let's re-enact it to see what they would have seen.   Keem: Okay Scott.       At this point, we realized that it was because of the monitors and the banana trees blocking the view. My only question is this: If you were a customer and saw this, wouldn't you mention it to someone?       There is a first time for everything. I would say that I've seen everything now, but sadly, I haven't. Here are a few quick ones about situations that happened while working for the same company.      This is an actual event in my home town. Sadly, my roommate from hell (I would think that everyone has had one of these at one point and time) knew the guy and was best friends with his wife. I had the opportunity to meet him once. Let's just say that he was a few cards short of a full deck. They say that robberies are often spur-of-the-moment rather than planned out. So a guy comes into the store with a shotgun and has the cashiers clean out the registers. He leaves the store and flees the scene of the crime. Imagine the clerk calling 911 and telling them that they were robbed. When asked about the robber, they told them that he took off on a bicycle and has the money and a shot gun. Hmmmm...do you think he got very far? Imagine my surprise the next morning when it was in the paper and my roommate and I realized that it happened to be her best friend's husband. Could it possibly be because he was going crazy working as a caretaker in the local cemetery? Yeah, I'd go crazy too if I could only talk to dead people at work. HA! I'm surprised that this didn't end up on Stupidest Criminals.      One guy that worked for the company had been held up and thought that he could prevent the thief from being successful because he was going to school to be a cop. He told the thief that he had to get something to scan from the shelf in order to open the cash register. Any guess on what happened? Yeah, don't piss off a person that is holding you at gun point or you just might get pistol-whipped. He was lucky he didn't get shot. I'm sorry folks, but if I am being held at gunpoint I'm going to cooperate. My life just isn't worth losing for my minimum wage job (okay, it wasn't exactly minimum wage, but it still isn't worth my pitiful salary).       My favorite part about working for the company as a manager was the interview process. You wouldn't believe the people. We were required to conduct security interviews for the second round interviews with a drug test to follow if they were someone you determined that was worth hiring. Here are some of the questions we were required to ask:      Have you ever done drugs?   Specifically Pot or Cocaine.   Have you ever stolen anything? Even as a small child? If you did, why did you steal? Will you ever steal again? What did you learn from stealing?   Have you ever bought stolen merchandise? Why or why not?   How did you know it was stolen?      Of course you tell the applicant at the beginning of the interview that everyone has done something at some point and time in their life. I am looking for honesty. If you aren't honest with me now, it will be harder to trust you in the future. Yeah. Honesty. If you tell me you did drugs, better luck next time.       Here are some of my favorites:      Keem: Well Jason, I would like to hire you. I have an appointment set up for you at the clinic for a drug test. You have to take it now. Once I get the results, as long as you pass, you will be hired.    Jason: I have to be honest with you. I tried Pot for the first time last night. Is that okay?      Keem: Mark, have you ever bought stolen merchandise?   Mark: Yeah, I buy it all the time.   Keem: Really, why?   Mark: You know, I know it's stolen, but the police never really do anything. I just report it and they give me this report number. They tell you that they will contact you if it comes up in an insurance report or whatever.   Keem: Wow. I'm surprised that they just give you a report number. I wonder why they don't do more than that. What types of stolen merchandise/property do you buy?   Mark: Stereos, speakers, radios, that kind of thing. Sometimes some clothes or whatever.   Keem: Well, Mark, it was great to talk to you. I should have my decision in a day or so.      Keem: (to the manager who did the initial interview) Shireen, I wouldn't hire him.   Shireen: But I really like him. He'd be great for the store.   Keem: I know, but he buys stolen merchandise. I don't think he'll work out. It's great that he was honest and all, but I don't trust him.    Shireen: Are you sure?    Keem: Yes, I know you liked him and this is the first person you've hired and all, but he won't work out.   Shireen: Okay. I understand.

       Let's face it. People need to talk. I understand that people like to hear words come out of their mouths, but try to understand and find the correct forum for this type of blabber. In working at the NABABNA call center for over 4 years, I've come across some extremely strange situations. I'm not trying to make fun of these people, but there are some calls that may have been crank calls, perverts, and psych ward patients.       One of the favorite calls I ever took for strangeness (and I think this was a crank, I really do) is as follows:   B: Thanks for calling NABABNA. This is Beth. How can I help you?   Mr. I-Need-a-Friend (INAF): I was shopping today and I saw a million dollar bill on sale for $1.99.   B: You saw a novelty item at the drug store?   INAF: What would happen if I bought it and spent it?   B: The Secret Service or the Federal Bureau of Investigation would arrest you for trying to pass counterfeit money.   INAF: Oh. Do you think my family would like one of these for Christmas?   B: I'm sorry Mr. INAF, but unfortunately I am unable to speak about the tastes of your family members. I'm not related to you or know your family.   INAF: Oh. I saw an ad on TV for presidential coins. When will they come out with the George W. Bush coin?   B: Unfortunately, I don't know. You might want to contact the Office of the Treasury.    INAF: You don't make the money?   B: No. The government handles the printing and minting of US Currency. We are a public bank. We could not make the physical money, that would be counterfeiting.    INAF: Would you like it if someone in your family gave you a million dollar bill?   B: Personally? No.   INAF: What's the largest bill in circulation?   B: In circulation? The largest bill that is commonly used is the $100 bill. The $1,000 bill hasn't been printed since the 1960s and when they come into circulation, they are pulled and given back to the Federal Reserve.    INAF: I think my family would like the million dollar bill for Christmas.   B: Then it's your choice to buy it for them.   INAF: I can't spend it?   B: No.   INAF: What if someone accepted it? B: Then they'd get into a lot of trouble.   INAF: I don't want to get anyone in trouble.   B: Then I'd suggest not trying to pass it as a legitimate form of currency.   INAF: Okay. So, who do you like for presidential candidates?   B: Sir, I work for the bank. I can discuss banking related topics with you.   INAF: Oh. Can we talk about the million dollar bill some more?   B: Sir, that has nothing to do with NABABNA. Did you have any NABABNA related questions or concerns about your account?   INAF: No.   B: Thanks for calling. Have a good night.   INAF: Bye!      Another call received at our call center. This one was not a prank. This was a legitimate person who needed help. This one actually made me a little sad and I understand why we have hospitals and people who devote their lives to this type of work. I admire the people who can handle this on a regular basis. The thing is, we are not trained for this at the bank. We are trained to help with accounts. That's what we do. Here's the call that was taken by a co-worker. I'll call her Sugar. That's how she sounded on the call. Sweet, caring, and helpful. I'll call the customer Personalities? Multiple. Syndrome. Otherwise known as PMS.      Sugar: Thanks for holding. My name is Sugar. How can I help you?   PMS: You're letting people steal money from my account!   Sugar: I'm sure I can help you. Are you stating there is fraud on your account?   PMS: Yes! Stop letting them take my money!   Sugar: Do you know who is taking your money?   PMS: Of course I do. It's my twin sister who no one else can see.   Sugar: Uh...   PMS: Make her stop.   Sugar: Let's start with the fraud claim. Which transactions are fraudulent?   PMS: I don't know.   Sugar: Which ones don't match your checkbook register?   PMS: They all match.   Sugar: So, all the transactions that cleared are ones you know about and you wrote in your register?   PMS: I didn't know about all of them. My sister writes them down in the register and then balances my checkbook for me.   Sugar: So you don't know if any of the transactions are fraudulent?   PMS: Well, some of them are. I have more money.   Sugar: Is there anyone who can help you go through your register to see which transactions are yours?   PMS: No. My sister is married to the Arch-Angel Michael and he works here at the hospital. They're all on her side.   Sugar: But no one can see her?   PMS: Well, Michael can.   Sugar: And he works at the hospital? PMS: Yes.   Sugar: And that's where you are?   PMS: Yes.   Sugar: Is there anyone there I can talk to?   PMS: Here's my caregiver.   Caregiver: Hello?   Sugar: Hi, my name's Sugar and I work for the bank. I want to help this person, do you know if this is a legitimate call?   Caregiver: She needs more medication. I was just coming in to give her the next dose. I'll handle it from here.   Sugar: Thanks for calling...      We get a lot of calls that don't need to come to the bank. People share information with us that they really shouldn't. Some of my favorites:      "I just brushed my teeth with Pesident. My breath is fresh. What type of toothpaste do you use?"   "Thank you for telling me when that purchase to the discount store was. Now I know the last time I menstruated and I can't be pregnant."   "My sister had a problem with ovarian cancer. Make sure you get tested. I worry for all women."   "I just had a hysterectomy. They took out all of my insides!"   "But I need more money. How am I going to pay for this prostitute?" "Do you smoke crack? I do. Crack, crack, crack, crack, crack!"   "Herpes are forever." "Public drinking fountains spread disease."   "I got beat up by the cops are LAX."   "Oh look! A car upside down on the side of the road."   "We're just happy little chipmunks."   "I'm naked. How old are you?"   "I need a girlfriend. Can you help with this?" (To which I replied, "Unfortunately, NABABNA does not offer a dating service." That's right. I did actually say this.)   "My neighbor's house is blue."   "But I need that money. I want to date my cousin and I need to go online and pay for the service to find her. She has beautiful eyes."      I did not make up any of these. I have a list that I keep. To get on the list, you need to be odd.

      I've received many an escalated call regarding joint accounts, enough to make me decide that if I ever finally find the guy just warped enough to marry me, there's no way his name is going on my account. I have enough problems trying to remember what I'm spending my money on, let alone worry about anyone else. Here are some examples of some of the calls I've received over the years.   Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery  Look, whatever you do is between you and God, okay? If you want to flout your disregard of one of the 10 Commandments in His face, well, better you than me, is all I can say. But, c'mon, if you're going to cheat, be smart about it. Your spouse is going to figure it out eventually, especially if you use your check card to buy your new sweetie a special gift.  I received a phone call from a banker who was having some problems with a non-customer. She was demanding to speak to a supervisor.  DM: Thank you for holding. I understand you wished to speak to a supervisor. Clueless Woman (CW): What are these overdraft fees for? I don't bank with NABABNA. DM: I'm sorry, I'm not sure of what the situation is, the banker said you couldn't be identified. CW: This is just stupid. This is a mistake and I'm going to prove it and then you're going to be sorry! Here is the account number...(she rattles the number off to me) DM: Okay, I have pulled up that account. May I have your name, please? CW: Clueless Woman. DM: I'm sorry, Ms. Woman, I'm not showing your name on this account. CW (Deep sigh tinged with sarcasm): That's what I'm trying to tell you. I don't bank at NABABNA. Why am I getting overdraft fees? DM: Unfortunately, I can't discuss this account with you since it's not in your name. CW: No, it's in my husband's name, Cheating Jerk. But we bank with Bank of Bank so he shouldn't be getting these overdraft fees. DM: Have you checked with him to see if he opened an account with us? CW: Well, why would he do that? That's just stupid. This is all your fault. You people screwed up and put his name on the account and mailed the statements to our house and started charging overdraft fees and he doesn't even have an account with you! DM: I see. I'd suggest that you speak to him about this, ma'am. Unless you're a signer, I can't release any information to you. CW: And look at this! Look at this statement! It's got a deposit from Large Corporation, where he works, in his name and with his Social Security Number. How did you get his SS#? DM: I'm sorry, I can't discuss this account with you (On mute:  He's hiding money from you! ). CW: And look at these purchases! Why would he possibly have any reason to make these purchases? Why would he go to Sleazy Bar or visit Sex Shoppe or Lingerie Store? He would have no reason to go there! DM: Ma'am, I'm sorry, again, I can't discuss this with you ( Oh, you poor deluded woman ). CW: Stop saying that! You keep saying the same thing over and over again! Quit it! I know this is a mistake! There's no reason for my husband to go to the By The Hour Motel! Tell me what's going on! Continued screaming! You people! I'll sue! Arrrrrrrrrrrgggggghhhhh! DM: Ma'am. Please calm down. This is not helping the situation. I would suggest that you speak to your husband about this. Unfortunately, I cannot answer any of your questions. CW (Deep frustrated sigh): He's cheating on me, isn't he? DM: I really, really wish I could answer that question for you, ma'am. Unfortunately, I can't discuss this with you. I would suggest speaking to your husband ( or your lawyer  (telepathically transmitted through the phone)). CW: Screw him. I'm getting a lawyer. Thank you.  She disconnected. I look at the phone. "Are you aware it's illegal to open mail addressed to someone else?" I ask her. There is no answer, of course, because she's hung up. I sometimes wonder what happened to her.   I'm Going To Tell My Mommy On You!  Why would you open up a checking account with your teenager? Well, if you were to do a survey about this, you would find that the majority of customers say it's because it's a great way to teach your child responsibility and how to balance a checkbook. And it is true, this is the best way to reach those goals. However, I have run into just a few situations where these good intentions are thrown out the window.  The following call is an amalgamation, if you will, of several calls I have received. In each of these calls, the teenager was the one using the account, the parent was only on the account to make transfers easier. So, since the teenager's the one using the account and they're being so responsible now, you would think they would be the one who would call about overdraft fees, right? Right? Wrong. Welcome to my world. Remember, italics are what I'm thinking. I would never ever talk this way to a customer. Really. Now, where the customer's concerned, the italics is what I imagine they are saying.  Banker: Dana (sadly, no one calls me DM in real life), I have an irate customer who is upset that there are overdraft fees on her joint account with her daughter (oddly enough, the majority of these calls are from the mother. An occasional Dad will call but not that often. And, yes, sometimes it's the son who screws up as well). She wants to speak to a supervisor and wouldn't let me identify her. DM (sighs inaudibly):  Joy.  I'd be happy to help her. Put her through (Banker introduces customer to me). Thank you for holding. My name is Dana. I understand you're calling about overdraft fees? Rabid Parent (RP): How dare you charge me overdraft fees! I have a great account and I refuse to pay overdraft fees! I've been banking with NABABNA for 15 years and I bring in a lot of money and I hold my mortgage with you and I'm not going to pay these fees! DM: Ma'am, I'd be happy to help you but first I need to ask you some questions. RP: Ask your questions! Go ahead, ask them! I dare you! DM:  Freak.  May I have the account number in question? RP: I don't know what it is, it's not my account! DM: I'm sorry, I wouldn't be able to speak to you unless you're a signer on the account. RP: Well, I am a signer but it's not my account! It's my daughter's. God, you're so stupid. DM:  Um, the minute you signed that account application, it became your account. Who's stupid now?  Okay, do you have any other accounts with NABABNA? RP: Well, yes. I told you I did! DM: Could I have an account number, please? RP: I just told you I didn't have...oh, any account number? (Rattles off account number) DM: Thank you. (I follow the procedures to identify the customer) Okay, Ms. Parent, I'd be happy to assist you. What concerns you about this account? RP: I'm being charged overdraft fees! DM: Yes, I do show that this account first became overdrawn two weeks ago and now has a balance of  -$163.52 . There were two items that overdrew the account and there were two fees assessed at $50 each (Note: This isn't how much our overdraft fees are. They are expensive, just not that expensive). RP: Well, I'm not paying them. This account can just stay negative for all I care. You bloodsuckers! DM: Ms. Parent, I apologize for your frustration but the account became overdrawn because of purchases that were made. We disclose all applicable fees to our customers at the time they open the account. I'd be happy to go through the account with you and determine if there was a bank error... RP: How would I know? This isn't my account! You stupid c-word! DM:  Don't call me names.  Ms. Parent, I'm trying to assist you. Please refrain from such language. I would suggest asking your daughter to review the account history and contact us if there is an error. RP: I want these fees reversed! DM: Unfortunately, Ms. Parent, I would be unable to reverse these fees unless I was able to verify that there's a bank error. RP: Reverse them!  Arrrggh!   I am screaming just for the heck of it!  Reverse them! DM: Ms. Parent, unless there is a bank error on this account, I am unable to reverse any fees. RP: Why not? DM: If there is a bank error, I would be happy to reverse the fees. At this time, I do not have any indication there is an error on our part. Please speak to your daughter and call us back or ask her to call us. RP: Hold on a second (Slams phone down). Ungrateful! Ungrateful, you get down here right now! Here, talk to this stupid bitch from the bank. DM:  Yes, calling me a stupid bitch just makes me want to help you even more.  Ungrateful Child (UC): Hello? DM: Hi, my name is Dana and I am a supervisor at NABABNA. I would like to go through your account to see if there is an error. UC: Yeah, you better. I know I didn't make a mistake. DM:  Yeah, right . Certainly, let me identify you (I identify UC). Now, Ms. Child, I see there was a purchase here to Trendy Clothes Shop for $75 and another purchase at College Hangout. Did you make these purchases? UC: Yeah. So? DM: Were you aware that your account had a balance of $5.00 at that time? UC: Yeah. So? DM: Well, when your account doesn't have the funds to support a purchase you made, this causes your account to become overdrawn. When this happens, two things can happen. Either the item is paid and you are assessed an overdraft fee or the item is returned, resulting in an Insufficient Funds Charge or IFC. Now this particular purchase was paid and an overdraft fee was assessed. UC: Well, reverse it. DM: I'm sorry but I'm unable to do that. This was not the result of bank error. UC: Fine, bitch. Talk to my Mom. RP: I told you to reverse those fees. DM (by now I have lost my patience. I have been called the c-word, I have been called a bitch, I have had this little punk sneer at me, I have had this woman scream at me. I have had it. It's time to get rough...or at least, as rough as I can get at work): Ms. Parent, I am going to speak frankly. I have explained that I can only reverse the fee if it is a bank error. Your daughter has just informed me that she was aware she only had $5 in her account when she made this $75 purchase. The overdraft fees were charged correctly. Courtesy reversals have been made on this account before and, in one situation, a remark was left stating that the customer was aware of the fact that no more fees would be reversed unless they are caused by bank error. There is nothing in our conversation that indicates to me that this will not happen again. RP: I think you're being rude. You can't lecture me! You can't tell my daughter how to spend her money! DM: Actually, at this point, she was not spending her money. She was spending NABABNA's money. And since we allowed her to make this purchase, we charged her an overdraft fee. There is not a bank error. RP: I want to talk to your supervisor! DM: Certainly. I'd be happy to transfer you to his voicemail, if you would be willing to hold. However, I must caution you that he will review your account the same way I have. Will you hold please?   Okay, so what did Ungrateful Child learn from this experience? If you said "How not to take responsibility" you would be exactly right. If you said "How to be a complete pain in the ass that will never amount to anything and be a blight on our society and will probably get busted for drug use and then her mom will be wondering what she did wrong and oh, my God, could I tell her!" you would not only be exactly right but learning to think like me...and that's just scary.  If you want to teach your kid to manage money responsibly, let them pay their overdraft fees. They'll figure it out.

      There's something about a full moon. All of the crazies come out and the calls at work get weirder and weirder. I just need to discuss a couple that I received today.  The first woman I spoke to had to be taught Banking 101. She just didn't get it. Surprisingly enough, her account wasn't in that bad of shape, but her comments were, let's just say, moronic. She was upset that she didn't get charged extra fees because the product she has for overdraft protection actually worked. Here's our conversation:  B: Thank you for holding Ms. Worry-wort (WW). My name is Beth and I'm a supervisor here at NABABNA. I understand you wanted to talk to a supervisor about your overdraft protection.  WW: This is all your fault! I shouldn't be overdrawn. What did that banker mean this isn't a bank error?!!!  B: I'm sorry Ms. Worry-wort. I would be happy to go through the situation with you and see what happened. I see the account went negative, what happened that made the account overdrawn?  WW: I wrote that check and it wasn't supposed to clear yet.  B: Okay. If you didn't want it to clear, why did you write it?  WW: I didn't think it would clear yet. That merchant shouldn't have cleared it yet.  B: Did you have an agreement with the merchant to hold your check?  WW: No.  B: Then the merchant had a right to collect.  WW: This isn't my fault. I wrote that it shouldn't clear until next week.  B: Okay, we're talking about post-dating checks then.  WW: Yes.  B: Unfortunately, post-dating checks is not something that will stop a check from clearing. Some states even have laws against post-dating checks. Once a check is written and given to the payee, the payee can clear the check. If you don't want the promise to pay to clear your account, you have two options. Don't write the check yet or place a stop payment on the item.  WW: But the teller wouldn't let me cash an item from three years ago.  B: So now we're talking about stale-dated checks?  WW: There's a difference?  B: Yes. One has a future date on it, one has a past date on it.  WW: What is a check?  B: Um, you've written checks before.  WW: But what is a check?  B: A check is a legal promise to pay someone. You have authorized the payee to have the funds written on the item.  WW: Oh. Why would I write a check?  B: To pay someone.  I really wanted to say, "They're pretty. It's just fun to decorate. Wasting paper is great!" This woman seriously has ten checks clear a day. You think she'd understand the whole concept of owing money somewhere and that this little piece of paper is how they are receiving the money.    WW: Okay. But this isn't my fault.  B: Did you give the person this money?  WW: Yes.  B: Then they could take it.  WW: Oh. Thanks!  B: Thanks for calling.  I sat stunned for a moment, trying to understand this woman's concerns. I still don't get her.  Here's the other weird call I got tonight:  B: Thank you for holding Mr. Freaking-Out-in-Public. My name is Beth and I'm a supervisor here at NABABNA. I understand you're having problems with your debit card.  FOP: I am out to dinner with my family and I need to pay for my $80 meal and my card doesn't work.  B: I'd be happy to look into the situation with you Mr. FOP. I am showing that your card was closed as stolen over two weeks ago.  FOP: That's right. I had my wallet stolen and I got the new card, but I threw it away since my wallet was returned.  B: Okay. But we closed this card two weeks ago.  FOP: But I have it back!  B: Um, once a card is closed, it remains closed. This is for security reasons.  FOP: Make it work! I can't pay for dinner. What am I supposed to do?  B: Have you considered writing a check?  FOP: I don't like checks. I didn't bring my check book.  B: Let me see if I understand this. You brought your family out for dinner with the only form of payment being a card that you reported stolen to the bank and you knew that it had been reported stolen?  FOP: Yes.  B: Unfortunately, I can't make that card work again. It's closed. I can reissue another card since it seems you threw out the new one we sent you. Unless you have a different form of payment, you might want to talk to the restaurant personnel about how to pay.  FOP:  Okay.  Thanks!  B:  Thanks for calling.  Why do people not think?  That's the problem with this world.  People don't realize that there is a little bit of planning and thought that goes into a day/week/year to make sure that it goes smoothly.  I just don't get people sometimes.

      Yesterday I took a call from a banker who told me his customer was very upset and wanted to speak to a supervisor. This is nothing new, I'm used to this. And then I was introduced to Ms. Ima Victim (IV).  DM: Thank you for holding, Ms. Victim. My name is Dana and I am a supervisor. John explained to me that you are calling about the insufficient funds charge (IFC) on your account? IV: Yes. DM: How may I help you with this today? IV: You charged me twice. DM: Yes, I am showing that you have had two seperate IFC's on your account. IV: You can't do that! DM: I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand. I show that your account became overdrawn and that caused checks to be returned. IV: I know that. That's not the problem. DM: Why don't you explain the problem to me? IV: It's the same check! You're charging me an IFC for the same check! You can't do that. DM: Ah, I see the situation. I show that check 1234 presented to your account on August 2nd and the funds were not available for it. The check was returned and later presented again on August 8th. The funds were still not available for the check and so it was returned to the merchant a 2nd time. You were assessed an IFC for each item. IV: It's the same check number! It's illegal for you to charge me twice for the same check! DM: Unfortunately, that's not the case, Ms. Victim. If a check is presented to your account and returned for insufficent funds, there will be a fee assessed to the account, regardless of the check number. IV: Well, why did you let it go through again? DM: Actually, the merchant would have submitted the item for payment, Ms. Victim. IV: You can't do this! Ever since I started banking with NABABNA, I've had problems. I wouldn't have left Bank of Bank but I moved. You people suck. ( Again with the you people ) DM: I'm sorry you've been having problems. Let's take a look at the account. Has everything come through your account for the right dollar amount? IV: Yes. DM: When you wrote the check, did you have funds available in your account? IV: No. DM: So you wrote the check, knowing you didn't have funds in your account and yet, you don't think you should be charged for the IFC? IV: No, you're not listening. I should pay one of them but not both because it's the same check number! You can't charge me twice for the same check. I'll only pay one charge. DM: Actually, charges are not assessed based on check number, they are based on each item. If an item debits your account multiple times and there are not funds available, you can receive either overdraft fees or IFCs. IV: I'm going to close my account if you don't reverse this charge! DM: I'm sorry, Ms. Victim, I am unable to reverse the charge, it is not the result of bank error.  So let's review, shall we? I looked at Ms. Victim's account. Yesterday was August 12th. The account was opened on July 5th. Her account had been opened barely a month and she had an item returned not once, but twice. And who's fault was it? Was it Ms. Victim's fault because she wrote a check when she didn't have any money? Of course not. It was NABABNA's fault because we charged her for her error. Evil NABABNA. Scourge of the Seven Seas.  This is what is wrong with our country. You have people who overdraw their account and then blame everyone but themselves. I come across websites everyday where someone is complaining about whatever bank they bank with because they screwed up and the mean old bank wants to charge them for it. Well, hello, people. You made a mistake. Learn to accept the consequences. It's not like we're saying "Hey, everytime you overdraw your account, we are going to have you flogged." You signed an agreement saying you would be responsible. You weren't. End of story.

      Back when I was working at Major's Department Store, I became friends with a guy named Jake. He used to have some of the oddest customers and this became one of my favorite stories. So I've decided to share it with you, changing his name and the store's name. I will be making the occasional remark, in italics.  Jake was working the Customer Service desk one day when this customer, Stupid Brainless Woman (SBW) came up and wanted to make a payment to her Major's credit card. Jake was happy to assist her with that.  J: I'd be happy to help you make a payment to your Major's credit card. I am showing you have a balance of $800.00 today. How much would you like to pay towards the balance? SBW: I would like to payoff the balance today. J: Wonderful. How would you like to make your payment? Will that be cash or check ( notice that he only gives her these two options. That's because these are the only two options )? SBW: No. Visa. J: I'm sorry, I can't accept a Visa card to make a payment to your Major's card. I can only accept cash or a check. Which would you prefer to use? SBW: Visa. J: I'm sorry, ma'am, I can only accept cash or check. SBW: Well, I want to use my Visa. You should let me use my Visa. J: I'm sorry, ma'am, but I can't process the request for you using a Visa card. However, I have a suggestion for you. You do have the option of making a cash advance from your credit card. If you were to visit a branch, you could make a withdrawal from the credit card and then pay your Major's card by using cash. SBW: That's a good idea. Where's an ATM machine? J: Well, there are five different banks outside of the mall. You could visit one of those ( there was an ATM in the mall, however, Jake was thinking she would actually go inside a bank and request a cash advance ) and ask a teller to process an advance from your card. You can also use an ATM if you wish. SBW: Okay, I'll be back.  About twenty to thirty minutes go by. The customer returns. J: Ah, Ms. Stupid Brainless Woman, how nice to see you again. Were you able to make a cash advance? SBW: Yes, I was. J: Wonderful. Did you still want to pay the full balance on your Major's charge? SBW: Yes. Here. She hands him a stack of twenty dollar bills. Jake starts counting them. J: Ms. Stupid Brainless Woman, you have given me $200. Is that correct? SBW: Yes. J: Your entire balance is $800. Will you be writing a check for the remainder of the balance? SBW: No. J: How would you like to pay the remainder of the balance ( Right now, Jake has not yet grasped the idea of how stupid and brainless this woman is. He honestly thinks that she might actually have $600 in cash on her. Silly Jake ) SBW: No. I'd like to use my Visa. ( It is here that I like to imagine Jake staring at her while crickets make that cricket sound they do. There is a bit of a pause (Oh, five cricket chirps )) Is there a problem? J: Unfortunately, ma'am, I am unable to use a Visa to make a payment to a Major's credit card. I can only accept cash or a check. Would you like to use either of those? SBW: Well, you told me I could withdraw cash and use the cash and I did. Why won't you help me? All I want to do is pay my credit card off. J: You're right, ma'am, I did make that suggestion. However, I thought that you would make a cash advance for the entire amount of $800. I apologize for not suggesting you do so ( I apologize for assuming you had a brain ). Perhaps you would like to make another advance? SBW: I suppose. I'll be back. J: Would you like to take your $200 back? SBW: No. You hold on to it. And she's off. Jake is worried that she will accuse him of trying to take her money so he makes sure he marks it with her name and card number and puts it on the rear counter.  Another twenty to thirty minutes go by. Jake looks up and there is the customer. J: Welcome back. How did the transaction go? SBW: Great. She hands him another stack of twenties. Jake counts it. He looks up at her. J: Ma'am, this is $200. This brings your total to $400. SBW: I know. J: Your balance is $800. Did you still want to pay off the entire credit card? SBW: Yes ( Annoyed, sarcastic yes. If you have seen In and Out, it's the same yes that Kevin Kline does when the tape asks him if he's a man ). What is the problem? J: And how did you want to pay off the remainder of the card? SBW: I want to use my Visa ( Jake is staring at her now with the universally recognized "You're kidding, right?" look on his face ). What? J: I'm sorry, I just wanted to make sure I understood. You wish to use your Visa. I have explained that I can't accept a payment to a Major's credit card from a Visa card, haven't I ( He wasn't being sarcastic at this point, he seriously thought maybe he hadn't explained it to her )? SBW: Yes, but I want to use my Visa and you told me I could do a cash advance. J: Yes, I do remember telling you that a cash advance could be done. I thought I made it clear that you should do the advance for the entire $800. I apologize if that wasn't clear. SBW: Whatever. I'll be back. And she leaves again. Jake includes the $200 she just gave him in the bundle of $20's he already has.  An hour passes. Jake goes to lunch, hoping that she will come back and someone else will get to deal with her. No such luck. He comes back from lunch and there she is, tapping her foot. J: Ms. Stupid Brainless Woman. How lovely to see you again ( yes, he was being sarcastic. No, she couldn't tell ). SBW: I've been waiting five whole minutes for you to come back. J: I'm sorry, I had gone to lunch. How rude of me not to be here when you returned. Didn't anyone else offer to help you? SBW: Yes but I didn't want them. I wanted to talk to you. J: I feel very special. Well, let's get that Major's card paid off. Did you do a cash advance? SBW: Yes, I did. J: Wonderful. SBW: Here is the money. She hands him another stack of twenties. Jake counts the money. J: Ms. Stupid Brainless Woman, this is $180. Were you still planning on paying off the entire card balance? SBW: Well, of course I was. Haven't we established that yet? J: Right you are. And how were you going to pay off the remainder of the balance. SBW: With my Visa.  Yes. She said it again. Jake is floored. He cannot believe anyone could be this stupid. In his frustration, he makes the biggest customer service mistake you can make...he lets the customer see that he is frustrated. He places both hands on the counter and looks up at the ceiling in an exaggerated, why God are you torturing me, slow motion kind of way.  SBW: Why are you doing that? Why are you looking at the ceiling that way? You think I'm stupid! J: Oh, no, Ms. Stupid Brainless Woman, I don't think you're stupid. I am just frustrated because we are obviously having a communications breakdown ( Nice cover, Jake ). I really want to help you make your payment but I don't know how to make you understand that you cannot use your Visa to make the payment. SBW: But I've gone to the ATM 3 times! And I have given you $600. What's the problem? J: I understand that you've gone to the ATM 3 times, however, you've only provided me with $580. SBW: No, I haven't. I gave you $600. I have my receipts right here ( She pulls out her ATM receipts. Because that's so going to prove that she gave him $600 ). Look! Look! 3 receipts. $600! J: Ma'am, I have the money right here. This last time, you only gave me $180. SBW: No, I didn't. You stole my twenty dollars! I want my money back! J: Ma'am. You watched me count the money. I have had it in front of you the entire time. SBW: Stop talking, you thief! I want my twenty dollars! J: Ma'am, if you would like, I can certainly ask the store manager to show you the tape of our entire transaction. SBW: Well, if you didn't take the money, what did I do with my twenty? J: I don't know ma'am, you were gone for awhile this last time. Did you go to lunch? SBW: Oh ( her face lights up. The proverbial light bulb is shining on her stupid brainless face )! I know what I did! I put it in my gas tank.  It is always at this point of the story that Jake would say " I seriously think she actually took the money, opened up her gas tank and put the money inside. I bet if they drained her gas tank, they would find a ton of money in there. She was that stupid."  J: Well, I'm glad we cleared that up. Now, we have $580 here. The card balance is $800. If you subtract $580 from $800, you have a total of $220 remaining. How do you want to pay this balance? Will you write a check? SBW: No. I want you to use my Visa ( You must admire Jake's restraint. A lesser man might have bludgeoned her to death with her Visa card ). I am the customer and the customer is always right. Do I have to speak to your manager? J: Hold on a moment (He has had it. He is about to lose control and he doesn't think he likes it. He grabs the phone and dials Visa). Visa Operator (Bob): Thank you for calling Visa. This is Bob. How can I help you? J: Bob, this is Jake Blahblahblah from Major's Department Store. I have a situation here. Our mutual customer, Ms. Stupid Brainless Woman, would like to pay off her Major's credit card using her Visa card. I would like you to help me resolve this situation for the customer. Bob: Are you crazy? You can't do that. You can't use a credit card to pay off a credit card. J: Yes, Bob, I am aware that you cannot use a credit card to pay off another credit card. However, Ms. Stupid Brainless Woman is insistent that I perform this transaction. Bob: She's standing right there, isn't she? J: Yes. Bob: She's an idiot, isn't she? J: Yes, Bob, that is correct. Bob: God, I hate these people. All right, let's see what we can do.  Bob, pulling some miracle out of thin air, is able to run the transaction through for Jake. The stupid brainless woman who has caused all of this trouble does not even have the decency to thank Jake for all of his hard work. She actually looks him straight in the eye and says "I told you I could do it."  Jake does not kill her but just smiles and tells her he was glad to help her. She then takes her Major's card out of her wallet and says "Now I'm going to go shopping and use my Major's card and my husband will never know I did it."  Okay, like your husband isn't going to notice the 3 cash advances at the ATM with the 3 seperate cash advance fees and the $220 charge on the Visa? Is your husband blind? Is he just stupid? I think I just answered my question.  Until next time, readers, in which I will regale you with other stories of morons.

      Many years ago I was working as a cashier for a major department store (Let's just call them Major's because they are still around and I will post about them later. Morons don't just bank. They shop as well.) I am wearing a name tag that has been carefully engraved with my name, Dana. I am at my station, ringing up customers. Ah, here comes a nice elderly couple. I begin to ring up the purchases. The gentleman smiles at me and says "They spelled your name wrong." I smile back at him and think "What?" I finish ringing up and, as they are walking away, the guy says "See you later, Diana."  I really, really wanted to say "Oh, thank you, sir! I am so stupid that I didn't realize that an I was left out of my name. What would I do without your keen observation skills?" Come on, people. Dana is not that uncommon of a name and yet, no one can seem to get it right. It is not Diana, Diane, Deanna, Deanne, Danna or Donna.  I actually had a teacher in junior high call me Donna for half the year. But she spoke so softly I just figured I was hearing her wrong. And then one day I asked for a pass to the nurse and there it was in bold writing, Donna V...... This is not my name. My name is not Donna. It's Dana. Repeat after me. Day. Nuh. Dana.  I even tried adding a Y to my first name. I thought "Hey, I bet if I spelled my name Dayna, people would get it." I was wrong. That just added to the confusion. Some people would call me Dayney. I thought about having it changed but my Mom wasn't thrilled with the idea. About ten years ago, I decided to try shortening my name to DM (Dee.  Em.  What is so hard about that?)  I figured that if there were only two letters, no one could get it wrong, right? Hahahaha. I was so naive. I thought about spelling DM out like Diem (as in Carpe Diem?), no one got it.  It's Dana. Or Dana Marie, if you prefer. I like DM. It's short and to the point. My initials are DMV so, if you are so inclined, you can even refer to me as the Department of Motor Vehicles. Just don't call me Diana.

      I love Dana.  Not in that way.  I do love her as one of my best friends in the entire world.  She's great.  She's said so herself (as in, "I'm great, I just don't remember it").  A night out with Dana is worth more than a year of comedy clubs, a decade of warm fuzzies, and a lifetime of penguins.  (Did I mention, I'm kind of random?)  Before I go too much further, I need to explain the title of this post.  This is one of the reasons I love Dana.    I like music right?  I think most people in the world would say they do.  I know that everyone has different tastes and that's perfectly fine.  Sometimes though, Dana scares me.  I had gone CD shopping one late Tuesday night (just to check out the late-night record shop) and yea! I found Paul Simon's greatest hits.  I, of course, am overjoyed.  My friends, Dana included, have enjoyed listening to other Paul Simon albums many a nights of playing Sheepshead.    The next day, I go to work as usual.  Sharing my excitement, I show Dana my new CD.  She scoffs and gives me this look like she's thinking, "Oh my God, why did she buy that crap?"  I stare at her in this puzzled fashion and feel a little hurt that she never mentioned not liking Paul Simon's music before.  I decide to let it go.  After work, Dana and I were to go hang out with Matt.  As we're getting to my car (Dana does not drive), I let her know her choices of music for the evening.  I have Eminem or Paul Simon.  I know that she hates Eminem and this she confirms by stating (imagine a heavy sigh first), "I'll put up with Paul Simon."  So we get Matt and are driving (for the life of me I cannot remember where).  The music is playing and Dana says, "Well, I like this Paul Simon song."  (I think it was Graceland.)  'O.K.' I think to myself.  The next song comes on and she repeats herself.  After about 7 songs, Dana turns to me and says, "Oh, I like Paul Simon!  Who's that guy I don't like?"    Here's the funny part.  When she asks me "Who's that guy I don't like?"  I respond, "Bob Dylan."  This was correct.  Matt is now in the backseat of my car, scratching his head and looking for Rod Sterling.  (For those wondering how I figured out the guy she doesn't like, you have to know Dana and follow associations.  Paul Simon and Bob Dylan were both folk singers from the same era.  Their last names could be boy's first names.  There is a connection.)  On a regular basis, Dana asks me why we are friends.  She's adventurous and impulsive, I'm logical and follow the rules.  She works days, I live at night.  At first glance, you would say the only things we have in common are: we're female, we both breathe air.  But then, life is not made up of appearances.  (If it were, many people with mullets would be in prison.)  Dana and I met through our jobs at a bank (to remain nameless - this is not a place to slam a corporation).  We both worked together on the helpdesk and at one time had similar schedules.  We still work together (only 3 hours a week) in positions that include the helpdesk and functions similar to assistant managers.  Does that make us friends?  No, it doesn't.  I work with many people (some for even more than 3 hours a week) and I wouldn't call them my friends.  I would call most of them co-workers.  So that doesn't answer the question.  Dana and I are both avid scrapbookers (so is Keem, but she'll get her own post).  We can watch movies, cut paper, laugh at pictures, drool over new cropping toys, and spend entire evenings working on creative projects to store our photos.  Does this make us friends?  It's an interest we both have and we have a good time doing it, but no.  I don't think this is what makes us friends.  I know other people who I definitely would not call friends who love to scrapbook.  I can walk into any scrapbooking store and see other people with the same interests I have and not call them my friends.  So, that doesn't answer the question.  When it comes to music, Dana and I are pretty close to being on the same page.  (Or should I say Page?)  We do both like Barenaked Ladies and Matchbox Twenty.  There are other bands we both enjoy, but then we both have some differences in our music choices.  So because we can laugh and sing to the same songs, does that make us friends?  I think not.  I've been to a few concerts and I wouldn't call the entire crowd my friends.  It just doesn't happen.    Are we friends because we both love watching movies?  No.  Lots of people watch movies and even if the movies we like are the same, it doesn't make people friends.    I think this entire random string boils down to my definition of friendship.  Friendship is one of the most challenging and exciting things about life.  Many people out there will tell you family is the most important thing, but I don't believe it.  I do believe family is important, I love my family dearly, but I think friendship is better.  I never hear anyone saying that they want to spend the rest of their life with their family.  They want to make their own family.  How do you make a family?  You surround yourself with friends.  I think you can make members of your family into your friends.  What is special is when your friends have become a member of your family.  Friends can be those family members you want around.    Friends can make you laugh.  They can make you cry.  They can be a shoulder when times are tough, or they can be a sun shining in the happy times.  What is most important in friendship is knowing they are there for you, just as you are there for them.  Dana is one of those people who I know, deep down in my heart, will always be a friend.  I will always want to hang out with her and laugh all night.  I will always want to get into deep discussions about politics, religion, or even minor things such as music or books with her.  If there is a problem in her life, I will want to help her deal with it.  She deserves the world and I want to help her in her journey to get it.    Dana and I are friends because I know she will always be true to herself and those around her.  She doesn't hide who she is.  She is willing to try new things, have fun, and chalk up the bad to learning experiences.  Dana has a kind soul, she loves life, and she spreads joy.  In knowing her, I call her my friend.  Friendship is a combination of so many factors, and when they come together, it is the best thing.  With Dana, friendship comes together.  She makes those around her smile.  She can be eccentric, she can have her silly days, but when all is said and done, she is true and one of the greatest people in the world.  I'm lucky to know her and (dare I say it) blessed to call her my friend.

      It was the best of times, it was the worst of times... What am I saying, it was the best of times.  I know that Dana is planning on explaining the rules of Sheepshead to the world through her blogspot - "greenduckies.blogspot.com" - but I really wanted to comment on one of her posts.  This required me to sign up for a blogspot and now I'm thinking it might be a little bit of fun.   I'm not going to explain Sheepshead in detail here, I'm just going to talk about how this game has brought a group of people together and created many nights of craziness.  The official Sheepsheadians are Dana, Kim (a.k.a. Keem), Adam, Matt, and I.  We are the ones who play the game and love it.  For over 3 years, our group has gotten together at certain all night restaurants to play for hours.  There have been numerous occasions where we've been at the restaurant long enough to order twice!  We have formed a strong friendship in our group and it is one that I know will last a lifetime.  In posts to come, I'll be talking about our adventures and the random, crazy things we do and sometimes hear.

      So, I've been working the second shift for over 4 years now.  When I started working the night shift, I had tons of friends who didn't work for this company.  As it stands now, the people I still talk to regularly all work or have worked for the same company as I do.  There is something about working the same number of hours as other people, but you end up cut-off from the real world.  I think I'm thinking about this since my supervisor is leaving for better hours.  Okay, I'm not getting to my point.  I have to explain something about my appearance.  I'm pale.  Really pale.  This is what happens when your heritage is all from Northern Europe.  I can fry in the sun within 10 minutes and be wearing the sunblock you use on babies.  There is no such thing as tan for me.  If I had pink eyes, I could be considered an albino.  I've now explained that I work nights and have very light skin.  Is it any doubt why people call me a vampire?  I don't drink blood and the whole giving up garlic thing is a horrible thought, yet people still wonder.  (Does it seem odd that the horrible part of being a vampire to me is the giving up garlic and the drinking blood is just an inconvenience?)  By the way, I helped friends move the other day and after two minutes of being in the sun, I felt like someone was setting my skin on fire.  It's a wonder I'm not a vampire.  Since I look like a vampire and act like a vampire, I think this has destroyed my chances of ever dating.  Not only do I work the shift where it is impossible to meet people, it seems all of my male friends are gay.  I don't look for gay men, they just seem to come out of the woodwork.  One of Matt's friends asked if I was seeing anyone and he replied no.  She then asked, "Has she tried hanging out with guys who like girls?"  This is my life.  Now I'm thinking of applying for a job that would keep my current schedule.  I want the position so I'm going to go for it.  I just keep hoping I'll run into that random guy (who knows where) that keeps the same hours I do and my life comes together.  Until then I'll just live the life of a twenty-five year old vampire.  Maybe the eternal life will come with it.

      Ouch!  Today was a rough day.  I know this sounds weird and all, but I'm one of those few people on Earth who actually like their boss.  Today my supervisor told me that he's switching teams and that there is a new position open for supervisor.  We have about 20 bankers on our team and everyone is bumming.    Before Phill (our supervisor) came in, our team did do very well, but he raised the bar.  Our team is surpassing anything we ever did before and it's amazing.  Everyone's bonuses on the team are sky-rocketing and everyone loves to come to work.  This is great!  And now, he's leaving us.    I know the people on this team can still be top performers, still have fun at work, and still go on, it's just sad that we're losing someone who is a great motivator and all around good guy.  It's right to let him move on to better things, but those left here feel a little lost.    In high school, I took this test to measure if I was pessimistic or optimistic.  I rated extremely high on the optimism side.  I'm trying very hard to optimistic about my boss's departure.  When he came, I told myself it was an opportunity to learn from his style of management versus my previous manager.  His leaving now will be another opportunity for change, which is good but also hard.  Who knows what will happen?  I'll keep an update here to the new developments.

      Alright, I held out for years.  I love to read but I tend to stick to one author.  I do occassionaly pick up works by authors other than Stephen King (The Da Vinci Code was good - if you want to try Dan Brown, read Angels and Demons first.  It's better and you can catch the formula for The Da Vinci Code quickly.  If you're looking for a light read with funny situations, I do recommend Mil Millington.  He's hilarious!) but I'm obsessed with Stephen King's works, especially The Dark Tower series.  (Like to the fact I'm thinking of taking a day off of work on September 21st just to read the last book of the series.)    Maybe my obsession for a good story began as a kid, the only story I remember clearly being read to me by my mother is Eyes of the Dragon.  Great story.  Absolutely wonderful.  My reading material in middle school consisted of such wonderful stories as It and The Talisman.  I held off from The Dark Tower.  I resisted it's pull.  Maybe because I was chicken and worried that the story would never be finished and I'd be stuck in limbo.  I'm not so sure that's the case.  I did read The Gunslinger pretty early in my life, but the story didn't grab me at that time.  I think it's because I didn't like the main character.  He was cold-hearted and dangerous.    So, last year I heard Stephen King was going to finish the series.  It was time.  I picked up the first book and plugged through it (which, by the way, is the shortest of all the books and took me the longest to read).  The second book, The Drawing of the Three, called to me.  I picked it up and fell in love.  Completely.  Ever since, I couldn't get enough.  (To the point that I've started watching old Westerns just to see gunslingers.)    All of this is just to bring me to why I started this post.  Last I had heard, the sixth book would come out sometime in August.  I, being the obsessed person I am, went online on June 1st just to see which day in August.  To my surprise, the release date had been pushed forward and I found that I only had to wait a week.  Excitement came over me!    On June 7th, 2004, just three days ago, the sixth book of the series came out.  It is called Song of Susannah.  In my obsession, I went to Wal-Mart on Monday night to be there at midnight.  The books weren't out yet so I patiently waited (inside screaming, "GIVE ME THE BOOK!") while a very nice worker went into the back and got me a copy of the book.  I made it quickly to the check-out and back to my car.  I had enough sense to not read and drive at least.    Now here's where there is my first problem.  (I'm calling it a problem, others would just call me insane.)  When I was handed the book, I became immediately disappointed.  Why, you ask?  Because it's only 413 pages long!  I was expecting something around the 900 pages mark.    I have other things to do (with moving in two and a half weeks I should be packing) but no, I get home and decide it is time to start reading.  I read half the book the first night and finished it the next.    Still on the edge of my seat waiting for book seven and the end to Roland's quest, I have some issues with the last couple of books.  I know that Stephen King likes to leave these stories with cliffhangers and that does not worry me.  What worries me is that this series, his epic story, may turn out to be a joke.  Here's the problems I am having with the last few books:  MINOR SPOILER ALERT *******************  1.  Stephen King wrote himself into the story.  I hate when authors do that.  It's like they're trying to say they're God and that they control the story.  Yes, Mr. King does try to steer clear of this a little by stating he's just the writer telling the story that needs to be told (like a scribe or something), but he's still influencing it and showing that in the work.  It's annoying.  2.  He keeps trying to freak me out by almost killing the cute little billy-bumbler Oy in the story.  Oy is like a dog but also like a raccoon.  He can talk (a little) and it seems he can cry.  Don't kill him.  He's cute.  You can't kill the cute little furry creature.  That's just my opinion.    3.  It's too short!  (I think I said that above, didn't I?  You would think that a story over 3,000 pages wouldn't be too short, but it is.)  4.  Roland has gone through life being cold-hearted.  He's finally made friends and understands that friends make up life.  I know that some of them might die and that's part of the story, but if Roland ends up sacrifing them, he's never been redeemed.  Book three was Redemption.  You can't go back.  (Again, my opinion.)  Okay, so maybe I don't have that many problems with the story and you could say that my getting so involved shows how much the story means to me.  I'm just hoping that the end result doesn't make a mockery of the trials to get there.  It's a great story, keep it that way.  I'm not saying it has to have a happy ending, just an ending that fits the work before it.

      Ever have those nights where you have been laughing and goofing around for hours and something hits you just right?  I'm sure you have.  These are the moments that make up life.  The title of this post comes directly from the demented mind of my great friend, Matt.    Matt is one of the Sheepsheadians and since Sheepshead is a game for usually 3 or more players, we have to deal when there is only the two of us.  Matt and I frequently meet for coffee and soda at the all night diner and play cards for hours.  When it is just us, we end up playing a card game called Liverpool Rummy.  The cards is something to do, but the best part is the conversations.  The title comes from one of these conversations.  One night, Matt and I sat at the all night restaurant, playing cards as usual, and we got onto a discussion about someone we both knew whose attitude had changed dramatically.  This person is someone who has strong religious affiliations and they decided to tell a Jewish man that his faith was wrong.  This person also decided to do this in a work setting.  Now I know I'm not the most religious person out there and believe strongly that religion has a place (church and private sectors), but I also realize some people feel strongly about their faith.  I admire that.  What gets me is those people who feel the desire to shove their beliefs down another's throat.  I am Christian, raised Lutheran even, however I have a huge admiration for the Jewish faith.  It seems to be the only one that doesn't believe telling people they are wrong because they believe a little bit different versions of a greater power.    Okay, I get off the subject sometimes.  This is about Matt.  As we were talking about what this person did to our Jewish co-worker, Matt says, "Oh, she better watch out before he whips out his 'wicked kung-fu dreidel spin' on her."  This is where his demented mind goes.  Could you imagine a ninja throwing a Star of David at someone?  Or screaming Yiddish while chopping boards in half?  We went on for quite some time about this one.    This brings me to Matt.  He's one of the best friends I've ever had.  You know the Kevin Smith movies right?  Take Silent Bob and lose the hair.  That's Matt.  Except not silent and I guess he doesn't wear a trench coat anymore.    Matt is one of those friends who you can laugh with, chat with, and know he'll always be there.  (By the way, Matt has a blog: it is www.thewindowlickingcat.blogspot.com - I still need Dana to show me how to do all this stuff.)  He's insane, but a lot of fun.  We've been able to discuss which Disney Princess we would each be and gotten on to random tangents such as the real lyrics versus what they sound like/should be.    I'm going to write more about Matt later, but I wanted to start with the Wicked Kung Fu Dreidel Spin.  Watch for it to hit theaters someday, long in the future.

      Okay, I know that I'm a little out of the season, but I just want to know what is everyone's favorite Christmas movie.  I have three favorites which I'm going to count down here to number 1!  3.  Scrooged, starring Bill Murray  A take on the classic tale of E. Scrooge.  Bill Murray plays a horrible human being, scaring people to watch his Christmas special to gain ratings at his network.  His former boss shows up to warn him about three (yes, three) ghosts who will visit him.  The first ghost is the Ghost of Christmas Past, played by David Johansen.  He plays a cab-driving ghost who brings Mr. Cross (Murray) to see his parents at Christmas time and sees himself watching T.V.  Mr. Cross is also taken to see himself at previous Christmas parties, eager to advance his career.   The Ghost of Christmas Present is played by the wonderfully funny Carol Kane.  The movie is worth her performance alone.  She floats through the air, showing Cross his brother and sister-in-laws party, as well as his secretary's family (complete with the little boy who can't talk - the miracle for the end of the movie).  The Ghost of Christmas Present enjoys torturing Mr. Cross by kicking him, pulling on his ears, and the best part - smacking him upside the head with a toaster.   Bobcat Goldthwait plays the man fired by Cross and hits the gutter.  Nothing can go right for him and he decides to take his revenge.   As Cross is escaping Goldthwait (character - Eliot Loudermilk), he runs into the Ghost of Christmas Future.  This is a little scary and disturbing, but hey, that's part of the story.  Of course the movie has its happy ending and Mr. Cross learns to love the season.    2.  National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation What can I say, this is a classic.  It stars Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo.  Randy Quaid is back as the brother-in-law Eddie.  The Griswolds do Christmas like no others.  Everyone can remember the scene when the Christmas lights finally work and of course the SQUIRREL!  It's outright laughs that go on through the entire movie.  If you haven't seen it, be sure to check it out this holiday season (or now, since I'm sure the rental desire isn't too high this time of year)!  And finally, my number one favorite: 1.  The Ref I can watch this movie year round.  It stars Denis Leary, Judy Davis, and Kevin Spacey.  Denis Leary is a criminal trying to get away from his latest heist in this town of insane people.  He takes Kevin Spacey (KS) and Judy Davis as hostages.  As the night progresses, relatives of this dysfunctional family start to show up.  KS's mother, played by Glynis Johns is one of the meanest mothers ever created for a movie.  My favorite part of the movie is when KS finally stands up to his mother (and entire family).  As he is talking, his mother interrupts him.  His (classic!) response is, "You know what I'm getting you next year for Christmas mother?  A big wooden cross so every time you feel unappreciated for all your sacrifices, you can climb on up and nail yourself to it!"  This movie is one that shows even dysfunctional families can be real and that life throws many curve balls.  You may enjoy when Santa Claus gets beaten up, when the cops record over the video surveillance with 'It's a Wonderful Life', and the entire meal where the guest have wreaths of lit taper candles on their heads!    Dana thinks my choice of favorite Christmas movies is disturbing.  I just like the real life stuff.

       Silent Legacy Melissa Etheridge   Why did you steal the matches From the one room motel Once they gave you answers Now they give you hell They will never understand They wonder where did they go wrong How could you be so selfish Why can't you get along   And as you pray in your darkness For wings to set you free You are bound to your silent legacy   You've seen it in the movies And you've heard it on the street Craving the affection Your blood is full of heat They don't listen to your reasons As original as sin Deny all that you feel And they will bring you home again  And as you pray in your darkness For wings to set you free You are bound to your silent legacy   Your body is alive But no one told you what youd feel The empty aching hours Trying to conceal The natural progression Is the coming of your age But they cover it with shame And turn it into rage   And as you pray in your darkness For wings to set you free You are bound to your silent legacy   You are digging for the answers Until your fingers bleed To satisfy the hunger To satiate the need They feed you on the guilt To keep you humble keep you low Some man and myth they made up A thousand years ago   And as you pray in your darkness For wings to set you free You are bound to your silent legacy   Mothers tell your children Be quick you must be strong Life is full of wonder Love is never wrong Remember how they taught you How much of it was fear Refuse to hand it down The legacy stops here   Oh my child   I've always loved this song.

      Dana changed her blog a little tonight and I became a mother approved blogger.  So is Keem.  (Who, by the way, needs to add to her blog!)  Why does Dana think this?    This all stems back in my life.  In high school, I was actually picked Ms. Goody-Two-Shoes.  Not because I necessarily was, but because I conveyed that image at school.  Maybe I just keep my dark side hidden.  I don't have a lot to say about this topic right now, I just needed to ask why Dana thinks I'm Mother-Approved.

      So they can become applesauce!  Dana hates, I mean, HATES, Laffy Taffy.  The jokes are terrible because they're made up by little kids.  Little kids without the influence of society and logic.  Since Dana claims to not use logic, I don't know why she can't enjoy these jokes.    There was a time when Dana went to Vegas for her sister's wedding.  Work was pretty boring without Dana around and so each day I would email her another joke from Laffy Taffy so that when she came back she'd know how much I missed her.  She was oh so appreciative when she returned.    Since I'm on the subject of jokes, I have to share one that is just classic.     Out in the country is a small farm.  There is a horse and chicken that are really great friends.  The horse and the chicken hang out together all day long in the fields of this farm.  One day they go for a walk.  As they were walking along, the horse falls into a pit of quicksand.  Yes, quicksand.  The horse starts to sink and cries out to his friend the chicken.  "Help me, I need you to pull me out!"  The chicken is afraid for his friend and he runs back to the farm as quickly as his little legs can carry him.  When he gets back to the farm, he looks around and sees the farmer's BMW parked nearby.  He hops in the driver's seat and drives the car to the quicksand (yes, his little legs were able to reach the pedals).  When he gets back to the horse, he throws a rope that he tied to the bumper and backs the car up, pulling the horse to safety.    The horse looks at his friend the chicken and tells him, "Thank you, thank you!  You saved my life.  You are my best friend in the entire world!"  The horse and chicken return to the barn and have a great party.  They celebrate life and friendship.  The horse passes out and wakes up later to hear screaming.  His friend the chicken is missing.  Worried about his best friend, the horse gallops out to the sounds.  He finds that the chicken had wandered around in the dark and fell into the pit of quicksand.  The chicken is telling him, "Please, help me!  Help!"  The farmer went to town that night so the horse couldn't go get the BMW.  He decides to straddle the pit of quicksand and lean down.  "Grab onto my member," he tells the chicken, "and I'll pull you to safety."  The chicken grabs hold and the horse pulls his friend to safety.  The chicken is grateful and tells the horse, "Thank you.  Thank you!  You are my best friend in the entire world."  And the morale of this story...  "If you're hung like a horse, you don't need a BMW to pick up chicks."

      Tonight I want to share a song that I heard from listening to Melissa Etheridge.  It's a song by an artist, Joan Armatrading, that was covered and it's a great song.  It tells a story of a woman who loves someone but is drawn to another.  It's called "The Weakness in Me."   I’m not the sort of person who falls in and quickly out of love But to you, I give my affection, right from the start I have a lover who loves me – how could I break such a heart Yet still you get my attention   Why do you come here, when you know I’ve got troubles enough Why do you call me, when you know I can’t answer the phone And make me lie when I don’t want to And make someone else some kind of an unknowing fool Make me stay when I should not If you’re so strong then resolve the weakness in me Why do you come here, and pretend to be just passing by I need to see you – I need to hold you – tightly    Feeling guilty And I’m worried, and I’m waking from a tormented sleep ‘Cause this old love, you know it has me bound But this new love cuts so deep If I choose now, I’m bound to lose out One of you is gonna have to fall… I need you, baby   Why do you come here, when you know I’ve got troubles enough Why do you call me, when you know I can’t answer the phone And make me lie when I don’t want to  And make someone else some kind of an unknowing fool Make me stay when I should not If you’re so strong then resolve the weakness in me Why do you come here, and pretend to be just passing by I need to see you – I need to hold you – tightly

      Why does everyone look at me funny when I use Barbie as a reference whenever something evil happens in their lives?   When I was a young girl, I did not have any sisters or any female cousins close to my age.  I did have a couple of female cousins who had outgrown playing with Barbies however, that gave me their old playtoys.  Between birthdays, Christmas, and the hand-me-downs, I had one of the larger collections of Barbies that people actually played with in the neighborhood.  Each summer, my older cousin, Ellen, would come to watch me.  We would play Barbies at least three times a week, after Ellen had watched her favorite soap opera.  Now, I’ve heard that most girls growing up had fun combing Barbie’s hair and putting her into cool outfits so she could go on her date with Ken.  Nice, normal right?  I don’t think so.  With the influence of Ellen’s soap operas, Barbie had the personality of a psychopath.    We had a running list of the things that happened in Barbie’s life.  You know, day-to-day stuff such as taking out the garbage (Ken), cleaning house (or making Skipper do that), planting flowers (oh, how decomposing flesh was a great fertilizer), and, well, you get my point.  There was a rule in the land of Barbie.  If someone was getting married and the bride or groom did not show up, the one left at the altar had to marry someone who showed up to the wedding.  The dolls had many marriages and divorces.  (Divorce comes naturally when you are forced to marry someone you really dislike.)  When Barbie got married, she didn’t change her name, she just added to it.  Now, not all of the female Barbie’s had the same name.  We were more creative than that.  Let’s see, there was Kristie, Jen, Sue, Hair (she was the Barbie with really long hair), Legs (you know, the style of Barbie that had the hard plastic legs, not the bendy kind so it was okay to put that one in jeans), and of course, Barbie.  Those are all I remember right now.  There were other Barbie’s of course, and I seem to remember they were named for the outfits they wore, but they were minor characters.    Ken was a sissy.  That’s all there is to it.  Since the Ken dolls were not that great to play with when I was a child (I don’t know if they’ve gotten any better), I had inherited some Dukes of Hazards dolls from Ellen’s brother, Brad.  The Dukes of Hazards dolls were slightly larger than Ken, so of course Ken clothing did not fit them.  They dressed rather unconventionally.  Luke and Bo wore togas to classy functions many times.  Old pieces of bed linen were also good to wrap up the men like mummies and sometimes they took to wearing Barbie’s skirts with elastic waistbands.    Looking back, I see how I had a demented childhood where women were powerful and able to kill, maim, cheat, steal, lie, and do whatever they wanted.  At least the men were able to express their sexuality!

      Anyone who knows me personally knows I don't have a problem with someone being corrected, but when the corrector (is that a word?) doesn't know what they're doing, I get irritated.   In my job, we have quality assurance. You've all heard it when you call a company. "This call may be recorded for quality assurance purposes." Maybe other companies don't take it as seriously, however the company I work for has hired Nazis to do the scoring on the calls. Okay, maybe not Nazis, but really evil people. Not all of them are evil, but I have so many grudges with the department at work, I needed to "vant." (See DM's blog for definition.)  Before I get into my vant, I do want to clarify something. For those who seem to think that "my call was recorded, go back and listen to it!" - THIS IS NEVER TRUE. Only the calls that have no purpose what-so-ever in life seem to be recorded. Even if your call happened to be recorded, the access to go back and listen to it is not there and I think planetary alignment would have to be perfect for one person's call to be randomly recorded, found, and replayed by someone in an entirely different part of the country! (Sorry, tangent. I'll get back on track now.)   There are some things in quality that I understand.  Making sure that employees are not releasing confidential information and staying within federal compliance guidelines are things employees should get marked down for.  I'm going to cite some examples of things from our quality department that I don't agree with:  "Active listening will prevent the your us .33."  - WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?  I wanted to dispute this call with, "Beep bop ork banking."  Maybe that's the language being used.  "I heard you swear during this 11 minute call.  That is unprofessional."  - Thanks for being specific.  (By the way, the swear word used here, if you're really worried, was the word, "debit."  As in, awe, debit!)  "You didn't thank your customer for calling.  You priced this call twice.  There was a long gap of silence.  Great call!"  - Is it just me, or is this condescending?  "You went the extra step for the caller.  You should have told them no." - This was followed by the banker failing the call.  Heaven forbid we actually keep the customer in mind once in awhile.  "I agree the customer should not have been using that type of language.  Telling them to 'calm down' is controlling." - What else are you supposed to do when they've called you "YOU PEOPLE" 25 times and dropped the F-ingheimer twice that many.  One of my favorites from Dana - in the comments of the call - 'The customer was looking for a branch in North Dacotah' - There are only 50 states, look up how to spell it.  As I come across even more wonderful sayings from quality assurance, I'll be sure to post them.

      Tonight I'm thinking of what song to post here.  I was looking through some of my favorites and I came across one I sang at karaoke last weekend and remembered how much I just like the story behind it.  For anyone who has ever had a crush and wanted someone you just couldn't have, this song sums it up.  It's from Les Miserables and it's called On My Own.   And now I’m all alone again Nowhere to turn No one to go to Without a home Without a friend Without a face to say hello to And now the night is near Now I can make believe he’s here   Sometimes I walk alone At night when everybody else is sleeping I think of him And then I’m happy With the company I’m keeping The city goes to bed And I can live inside my head   On my own Pretending he’s beside me All alone I walk with him till morning Without him I feel his arms around me And when I lose my way I close my eyes And he has found me   In the rain The pavement shines like silver All the lights are misty  In the river In the darkness The trees are full of starlight And all I see is him and me For ever and forever And I know It’s only in my mind That I’m talking to myself  And not to him And although I know that he is blind Still I say there’s a way for us   I love him But when the night is over He is gone The river’s just a river Without him The world around me changes The trees are bare  And everywhere the streets Are full of strangers   I love him But everyday I’m learning All my life I’ve only been pretending Without me His world will go on turning A world that’s full of happiness that I have Never known   I love him I love him I love him But only on my own   I know it is a sad song, yet I still feel a little uplifted by it.  One thing to remember about love is even when it isn't returned, think of the joy you feel when you get a little bit of that person in your life.  Knowing that the person is sharing themselves with others and learning how much joy they are spreading.  Caring for someone is not a crime.

      I've written before about the Dark Tower series by Stephen King.  I thought I was obsessed.  I just needed to share the fact that I have not gone too far.    The other day I was looking for a certain piece of artwork from one of the books and came across the official fan site for these books.  Being curious on how crazy people were, I looked at the merchandise for sale.  Now, I admit, I love these books.  I'm anxiously awaiting the final chapter in the story to see if Roland makes it to the tower.  I have never, I repeat, NEVER, thought about owning Dark Tower underwear.    Nothing says sexy like a pair of Stephen King thong underwear.  And the best part of this insane idea is the fact Roland sayings are available on the underwear.  Does this seem appropriate?  "First comes smiles.  Then lies.  Then gunfire."  What!?!  Why???  Needless to say, I'm not going to purchase these.  Just thought I should share this fact.

      I just got my Matchbox Twenty concert in the mail.  Yea!  It's great.  I've watched it four times already.  (This is better than having actual network t.v. playing.)  One of the songs from Matchbox Twenty's third album is called, "Soul," and I love it.  It's a wonderful song.  I just wanted to share the lyrics here:  Hang out my window over your head Stare at your feelings to see where they end You're waiting here for someone else to break you from the inside You've been so composed But we all know there's  Always something tearing you apart It's always so much longer than you counted on And it hits you so much harder than you thought But you don't worry You don't worry Cuz you got soul  You're so heavy you're so misunderstood I spent all my wishes wishing times were good when I still could Wait around here for someone else to take me past the good side At it for so long you don't show there's   Always something tearing you apart It's always so much longer than you counted on It hits you so much harder than you ever thought it would You don't worry You don't worry Darling you got so much soul Darling you got so much soul  There's always something tearing you apart It's always so much longer than you counted on It hits you so much harder than you ever thought it would But you don't worry But you don't worry But you don't worry But you don't worry But you don't worry But you don't worry Cuz you got soul  Matchbox Twenty is one of those bands that surprised me.  When their first album came out, I pondered purchasing it because I only knew two of their songs.  I've bought so many albums for a couple of songs and been disappointed.  I put in the first album and LOVED it.  It's wonderful.  Then came the second album.  Bands tend to disappoint with the second album.  Not this time.  Wow!  When I heard about the third album, I thought it couldn't get any better.  It did.    The third album by Matchbox Twenty is called, "More Than You Think You Are."  In listening to the album, you can tell the influence 70's rock had on this band.  They capture the feeling of a great era of music.  If you're someone who wrote off Matchbox Twenty because you didn't like, "Push," give this album a try.  It's a different feel and the songwriters hit those emotions you never could quite vocalize.

      I don't watch a lot of television, but what I do watch tends to be at 2 or 3 in the morning.  This enables me to memorize all the different late night commercials jingles.  Why, I don't know.  Is this useful in life?  No, it's not.    One of the commercials that I hate is for the Twin Cities People Store.  Unless you're from the Twin Cities, you have never understood how stupid this commercial is.  It's for a dating service.  Basically there are black and white pictures of people in ballerina dresses and holding mops.  I think it goes, "Too busy with chores?  And all those dance lessons!  Meet people the old-fashioned way, dial the Twin Cities People Store.  It's an easy way to meet nice people."  That's the gist of it.  What bothers me about this is the fact that when I think of meeting people the old-fashioned way, I don't think of dialing a phone and listen to "nice people describe themselves."  Is this old-fashioned in any way shape or form?  Ugh!  In my book (which doesn't exist but maybe someday), the worst commercial ever was for Quizno's Subs.  It involved these singing things (they looked like hairless rats but I guess they're supposed to be bread - I'll get to that) with horrible voices singing about how bringing in a coupon would get you a dollar off of a sub.  These rat-things would sing (I think I mean scream) "EAT QUIZNO'S SUBS!  ANY COUPON WORKS" and something about a hair-cut.  The first time I saw this commercial, I sat up and said (probably loudly), "What was that?!?!?!?!?!?!?"  This commercial did not last long.  Most sane people thought using hairless rats to promote food was not a good plan.  What's even worse is the fact these are supposed to be loaves of bread.  Great!  Now I'm hungry because food is screaming at me to "EAT ME!"  It's like promoting cannibalism.  I think I would be freaked out if a cow mooed at me, "I'm tasty."  (Well, I might freak out after I've sold the cow to a circus because that's just cool.  A talking cow!)  You know the Mattress Giant commercial?  The words never change but if you pay attention you'll notice the pictures change.  My life is so sad.    All of my friends can actually sing the lyrics to the National American University commercial.  You know the one, "One day, one night, Saturday is alright...."  It's sad.    In realizing that I don't watch a lot of t.v., I'm afraid for America.  I watch maybe four hours of t.v. a week and this is what I remember.  Let's try to make this world a better place.  Pick up a book once in awhile.

      I'm not sure who "they" are, but they're wrong.  Great songs are written all the time.  If I had to state my favorite musicians, I would probably say, "Barenaked Ladies, Matchbox Twenty, Melissa Etheridge, and Garth Brooks."  There are other great artists out there, but these ones have special places in my heart.  I must say that I've cried from all of these artists.  I have jammed out and sang at the top of my lungs in the car from some of these songs.    BARENAKED LADIES (BNL) (Check out www.barenakedladies.com) My number one favorite song of all times is from this group.  It is called "Break Your Heart."  It's all about how to tell someone that you really don't want to be with them anymore, but you're too afraid of hurting them.  Here's the lyrics: "The bravest thing I've ever done, was to run away and hide.  But not this time, not this time.  And the weakest thing I've ever done, was to stay right by your side.  Just like this time, and every time.  I couldn't tell you I was happy you were gone, so I lied and said that I missed you when we were apart.  I couldn't tell you, so I had to lead you on.  But I didn't mean to break your heart. And if I always seem distracted, like my mind is somewhere else, that's because it's true, yes it's true.  It's this stupid pride that makes me feel, like I have to follow through.  Even half-assedly, loving you.  Why must I always speak in terms of cowardice?  When I guess I should have just come out and told you right from the start.  Why must I always tell you all I want is this?  I guess 'cause I didn't want to break your heart. And you said, 'What'd you think that I was gonna do?  Curl up and die just because of you?  I'm not that weak you know.  What'd you think I was gonna do?  Try to make you love me much as I love you?  How could you be so low?  You arrogant man, what do you think that I am?  My heart will be fine.  Just stop wasting my time.' And now I know that you will be okay, and that I got what I want.  And that's rid of you, good-bye.  And it's not 'cause I'll be missing you, that makes me fall apart.  It's just that I didn't mean to break, no I didn't mean to break, no I didn't mean to break your heart."  Why do I love a song about a break-up?  Is it some sick, morbid fascination to pain?  I don't know but when I heard Stephen Page wail out those lyrics the last night of my vacation in Vegas, I had tears streaming down my face.  Not just a minor display of waterworks, but all out water pouring from my eyes.    I think there are great songs out there that touch different people in many ways.  Music is universal.  As songs touch me, I will probably write about them here.  Maybe the words that someone felt the need to put down will touch someone else.

      I've had a rough weekend.  Nothing too terrible happened and the world is still turning, but I'm beat.  It seems everything that can happen to me will.  My weekend started on Sunday and I helped a couple of great friends move to their new house.  Nothing bad happened and it was nice to spend time with them.  I'm physically drained from lifting and running boxes into a house in the sun (and it's not all that hot out yet).  I have a couple of mosquito bites (hello Minnesota!).    I tried the new Coca-Cola.  C2 is what it's called.  It's low-carb Coke.  It's disgusting.  Horrible.  Didn't the Coca-Cola company learn from New Coke?    By the way, the whole low-carb fad?  It's dumb.  I'm so sick and tired of hearing "Atkins friendly menu" and "low-carb" this or that.  It's too much.  Okay, so America has a weight problem.  It's not just from carbs.  It's because people in America forget that things are good in MODERATION!  Think about it.  Compared to the rest of the world, do we do ANYTHING partially?  No.  Look at L.A.  Just give me my sugar and let me eat my buttered toast and baked potato and my Coke.  I'll be responsible enough for myself to eat these things in moderation.    Random tangent aside, back to my weekend.  After wearing myself out, I decided to go to karaoke with Dana on Sunday night.  We had a great time.  As always.  Of course great times include bawling like idiots in public.  Song writers do this on purpose.  It's not like they're trying to tell a story that really means something to them, no, they're just trying to make people cry.  (Maybe that's not they're intent, but I think it is.)  I got up today to mounds of boxes in my apartment.  I'm moving in two weeks and my roommate is moving out this week.  In fact, tonight is probably his last night here.  I'm also thinking of applying for this job at work and so I decided it was time for new clothes and went SHOPPING!  Now, I've written how sad I am about my boss leaving and now my roommate is moving and my mom keeps calling me about how my grandma is ill and how our dog of 17 years is getting slower and I'm thinking of writing country western songs!  What do they say, oh yeah, 'when it rains, it pours.'  I'm excited about my new place (scrapbooking, close to work, close to my dad) but I'm still sad to think that next week I won't come home and find my roommate in the living room and us staying up to chat for the next six hours.  He is my best friend and having him around is not a bad thing.  We've had our moments, sure, but that's what makes friendship so important.  The differences are what makes you stronger.    Okay, so I'm off the point again.  This happens (I think Dana is rubbing off on me - sorry Dana!).  My original question was 'What ever happened to customer service?'  I have dealt with some of the dumbest people this weekend.  I called the cable company today to switch my service to the new place.  The woman I talked to did complete my request but I wanted to ream her out.  Why, you ask?  Have you ever talked to someone in a professional environment over the phone?  Do you think that coughing and the clearing of the throat is a good thing for a customer to hear?  I wanted to ask this woman if she's ever heard of the mute button.  I wanted to say, "You know that button you push when you're calling your customer @$$ and other pretty terms?  Try using it when you cough.  That's what it is actually for."  I mentioned before that Dana and I went shopping.  I needed new clothes and I decided that since I was at the mall and I accidentally threw away the good white bra that actually fit me (I ended up keeping the one that was too small) I was going to buy a new one.  I went into the store I always buy bras from and dealt with this snide, stupid woman.  I told her I wanted a white bra and she says, "Nude is a better color."  I told her I already had a nude bra and I wanted a white one.  Then she says, (while looking at Dana in a white shirt), "White bras are too bright and nude will be hidden better."  Since she didn't listen to my request, I said, "I don't need any bras.  Thank you.  Good-bye."  Maybe I've been working in customer service too long and I can't stand poor service anymore.    One final note of something funny this weekend.  Here is a direct conversation Matt had with his five year old Riley:  Matt: "What happened to your head?" Riley: "I falled." Matt: "Fell." Riley: "Felled." Matt: "Fell." Riley: "Felled." Matt: "Fell." Riley (defiant look): "Fell-ED!" Matt: "Whatever.  We'll work on that one later."

      I am finally moved in.  Boxes still abound and tonight I accomplished very little (I downloaded the trial version of Zuma and beat the game.  It only took like 5 hours.  This is of course after I had to call the cable company because when they transferred my modem service, they created a new account, not the same one, and so my Internet access worked for about 1 hour when the guys came and then died.  I had to re-register.)  I love my new place.  The fact that I feel completely comfortable sitting in the living room, watching movies (there might be one or two DVD's available for viewing here), typing on my blog, playing stupid computer games, or just sitting and reading a book at 2:00 AM is fantastic.  This apartment is larger than the space I had at the previous place and it is closer to everything I want to be able to do (except it is a little farther from Dana and Keem's place =(.)  The move on Sunday went rather well.  I had wonderful, WONDERFUL, friends and family helping me.  My mom even commented about how great my friends, Dana, Matt, and Scott are.  I appreciate all that they have helped me with, even when there is no reward for them.  I think it is great that they made a commitment to me and kept their word.  It was raining on Sunday and of course I decided this week (when I'm on vacation from work) would be the best time to come down with a stupid cold.    Random question - when did NBC start showing soap operas at 2 in the morning?  This is why I hate T.V.

      You are not the worst friend in the world.  If you didn't feel good, that's fine that you stayed home.  I'd rather have you feel better than come and pack crap up with me.  Besides, you would have walked into that smell.  He's trying to kill me.  I figured it out.  First, leaving the milk to spoil in the fridge (ick!) and then he came over on Thursday to clean out some more of his stuff.    If your roommate is cleaning the fridge and grabbing his stuff and he says, "Anything else in here I'd throw away but it would need to be taken out right away,"  that, to me at least, means "I didn't throw anything that can rot away."  I guess taking frozen vegetables and other frozen foods, tossing them in the trash, and then leaving it so the other person doesn't know that it will rot is okay.  I came home last night and about lost any bit of food I had that day.  He's trying to kill me.  Dana - you are not the worst friend in the world.  And it's not just that there are other people who are bad friends (Hilter had to be a meanie), you are a good friend.  A great friend.  You are willing to try new things, you will get out and go places with me even if you don't want to knowing that trying it is important.  Granted, you should turn your cell phone on once in awhile.  =)  I enjoy spending time with you and that is what makes you my friend.  You should read my "Oh, I like Paul Simon, who's that guy I don't like?" post again.

      Okay, so the title of this post is because the lyrics here have been misunderstood.  The song of the night is Brian Wilson by Barenaked Ladies.  This is one of my favorite songs, and it doesn't really have too much meaning to me.  Listen to the live version if you have a chance (found on their greatest hits album - a must have!).  It speeds up but it is so full of energy and life and I love it.  Any song that has guts enough to end with instrumental and still hold true is worth it.    Brian Wilson  Barenaked Ladies   Drove downtown in the rain Nine-thirty on a Tuesday night, Just to check out the late night  Record shop. Call it impulsive, call it Compulsive, call it insane; But when I’m surrounded I just  Can’t stop.  It’s a matter of instinct, it’s a  Matter of conditioning, It’s a matter of fact. You can call me Pavlov’s dog Ring a bell and I’ll salivate - How’d you like that? Dr. Landy tell me you’re not just a  Pedagogue, ‘Cause right now I’m  Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did Well I’m lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did  So I’m lying here Just staring at the ceiling tile, And I’m thinking about what to  Think about. Just listening and relistening to Smiley Smile, And I’m wondering if this is some Kind of creative drought Because I’m  Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did Well I’m lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did  And if you want to find me I’ll be Out in the sandbox, Wondering where the hell all the  Love has gone. Playing my guitar and building Castles in the sun And singing, “Fun, Fun, Fun.”  Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did Well I’m lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did  I had a dream That I was three hundred pounds And though I was very heavy I floated ‘til I couldn’t see the Ground I floated ‘til I couldn’t see the ground Somebody help me, I couldn’t see the Ground Somebody help me, I couldn’t see the Ground Somebody help me because I’m   Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did Well I’m lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did  Drove downtown in the rain Nine-thirty on a Tuesday night Just to check out the late-night Record shop. Call it impulsive, call it Compulsive, call it insane; But when I’m surrounded I just Can’t stop.   If you're wondering, pedagogue is similar to a student teacher.

      In my life, I've seen a lot of movies.  I don't like television much, but watching a full length film is something I truly enjoy.  I tend to stay away from the classic movies that everyone has seen (Godfather, Sound of Music, Wizard of Oz, Star Wars (I saw those about two years ago for the first time), etc).  The movies that grab me are dramas and usually not the ones that everyone enjoys.  There are some great movies out there that no one is interested in because they don't make us laugh, they have a deeper meaning, and it's not an easy topic to discuss.  As I come across some good movies, I want to share them here.  I just finished watching  urlLink A Perfect World  directed by Clint Eastwood in 1993.  It stars Kevin Costner (KC) and Clint Eastwood (CE).  Set in West Texas, early 1960s, this movie plays with themes that are not unsuitable for children, just beyond the grasp of most children's intellect.    KC is an escaped convict who ends up taking a little boy hostage on his joy ride through Texas.  CE is the law enforcement heading the manhunt.  The story line between KC and CE is unnoteworthy, it is the bond formed between KC and the little boy that makes the movie.  KC came from an abused home and the boy (Phillip is the character's name) has no father and sees KC as a father figure.  He joins the convict willingly in many of the situations of the movie.  Costner plays a deep character who is an evil man with strict values that many can relate to.  He cannot stand when children (especially Phillip) are harmed or abused.  The hard part to deal with is the fact that you can understand his emotions, but not his actions.  In one scene, he sees a man who helped them push his grandson around.  Costner's character ties this man, the woman, and the little boy up and puts a gun to the man's head.  As the woman starts to pray, he gags the three with duct tape and reaches again for the gun.    The little boy in this film did an amazing job.  You can see where he feels oppressed in his life and how he bonds with KC.  The ending is emotional (Dana - you'll cry but I still want you to see this movie) but worth it.  The movie does run a little slow and there are characters not needed to tell the story, but Eastwood does well as a director to keep the focus on KC and the boy.    The movie is rated PG-13 for "some violence, sexual content and language".  The sex is minor (which KC has a great line!) and the violence is a couple of people being shot, the scene described above, and KC breaking another man's nose.  The language is pretty minor (I think damn and shit are the only words I even noticed) but I would not recommend this to little kids.  I know I was 15 when I originally saw this movie and never quite understood all of the themes until I watched it again.  It is a thinking movie and worth the thought.

You can be best described as: attitude You've got lots of it - and you love to give it A guy has to be pretty gusty to hit on you But if he's your type, you'll warm up... a little   Here's a question for anyone who knows me: Do you think this is true?

      Don't get me wrong.  There are definite things to being an adult that are great, but I wish there were some of those childhood innocence ideals that could be held onto forever.  One of those is the first day of summer.  Remember the last day of school every year?  How relaxed and full of possibility it was?  I remember sitting in class, watching the clock tick down, waiting for that moment when the bell would ring and the halls would fill of students rushing out to start their summer adventures.    Summer was always a time of sleeping late, playing games, and exploring.  In one of the neighborhoods we lived in there was a weekly puppet show.  This is one of those things that can only be enjoyed through the eyes of a child.  The kids around and I would make up games, running through the woods nearby, never fearful of other people but each monster we made up was real.  You could believe the summer would last forever because it did.  To a child, three months is a lifetime.  It wasn't the nice weather, it was the idea of having no responsibilities, no place to go.  All you had to worry about was getting home in time for supper.    I miss the feeling of that last day of school, the true start of summer.  I enjoyed going to school and those responsibilities but nothing beat that feeling of possibility.    Was it the nice weather that made summer great?  I don't think so.  Nice weather still comes each year (although I like spring and fall more than summer), it just never falls in line with that last day of school anymore.    I posted a song the other night that reminded me of a boy I knew in high school.  Thinking about him got me thinking about the last day of school.  Even in high school, when summer meant hours of working to afford all those late nights out playing pool, going to the drive-in, and driving for hours on end, the last day of school still filled my heart with happiness.  Maybe it was the fact it was him or maybe it was the fact it was the last day of school on my last summer before adulthood, or maybe it was a little bit of both, but I was ready to have fun and go against my strict logic.    As we were leaving school that fine, sunny day, he turned to me and asked simply, "Can I drive?"  Now, this may not seem like a lot, but it really was.  As I mentioned, I have strict logic reasoning.  He didn't have a license and had never driven a stick before and I loved my car.  But the sun made his eyes sparkle and of course, I caved in.  I started my last summer of being a kid laughing and smiling and just enjoying his company.  I still remember that mischievous smile of his and it lifts me up.  We are lucky as human beings to experience things and make memories that we can carry for life.  The feeling that day will stick with me forever.

      Dana mentioned to me the other day that she is liking the exposure to Melissa Etheridge from my blog.  This is another song by her that I have loved ever since I first heard it.  I hope you enjoy.    Nowhere to go  Melissa Etheridge  I know a place Down past an old shack On a road that goes to nowhere Ain’t nobody coming back  We can go there tonight We can talk until dawn Or maybe something else I’ll leave the radio on  There’s no one to hear You might as well scream They never woke up From the American dream And they don’t understand What they don’t see And they look through you And they look past me Oh you and I dancing slow And we got nowhere to go  Past the Wal-mart and the prison Down by the old VA Just my jeans and my t-shirt And my blue Chevrolet  It’s Saturday night Feels like everything’s wrong I’ve got some strawberry wine I want to get you alone  There’s no one to hear You might as well scream They never woke up From the American dream And they don’t understand What they don’t see And they look through you And they look past me Oh you and I dancing slow And we got nowhere to go  Down by the muddy water Of the mighty MO In an old abandoned box car Will I ever know  Dance with me forever This moment is divine I’m so close to heaven This hell is not mine This hell is not mine  There’s no one to hear You might as well scream They never woke up From the American dream And they don’t understand What they don’t see And they look through you And they look past me Oh you and I dancing slow And we got nowhere to go

      I just ran across a blog that I didn't realize existed.  One of my favorite bands has a blog and of course my favorite member of that band is the one who likes to write the most frequently.     urlLink BNL Blog   Stephen Page (sigh) has even written about "Dodge Ball" which I just went to see with Dana and Keem tonight.  He was hoping it would be as good as "Zoolander" and I believe it was.  If you enjoy Ben Stiller at all, check out this movie.  Look for fun cameos and enjoy the cracks at intelligence.  Okay, and if you want to really hate me, check out this website that Dana found awhile ago.  It's horrible, wrong, and you will laugh.  You'll feel your soul escaping from your body as you do it, but you will laugh.  (Warning, this site has sound.)   urlLink BK Holiday

      As I've mentioned before, I work in a call center for a bank and I take escalated calls.  I took a call on Saturday night that reminded me of how much we, as human beings, need to be there for each other.    Most of the calls I usually take are the customers yelling about how it's all "you people's fault!" that they spent more money than they actually had.  My level of tolerance and goodwill for this type of customer has decreased significantly over the years.  Don't tell me your baby can't eat and it's my fault when I can see your purchases for cigarettes, liquor, casinos, and X-rate porn Internet sites.  It's not my fault, or anyone at the bank's fault, that you put yourself into this situation.  Be an adult, make choices like one.  The people I do have sympathy for are the ones stuck in situations they never had a choice over.  Victims of fraud are people I can understand.  Battered women touch my heart and I wish I could help them more.  Soldiers risking their lives to help others gain my sympathy.  On Saturday, I spoke with a woman whose family is full of money grubbing vultures.  She is disabled but worked hard in her life to get where she is.  When her mother passed away, her brother and sister-in-law decided to take advantage of her disability to trick her into giving up money and suing her to make her lose her home.  She's going to be homeless next week.  Her brother beat her up and abused her mentally.  This woman was afraid that he was trying to gain access to her accounts.    Some people would say this woman was telling me a story and I fell for it.  The thing about it is that she didn't have any reason to lie to me.  She didn't want fees to be reversed or any changes on her account.  All she wanted was to know how to protect her information.    I've talked to other people stuck in similar situations.  I spoke with one woman about three years ago whose husband put her in the hospital.  She was a quadriplegic and couldn't defend herself.  I hope she is doing okay.    That's one of the tough parts of our job.  Those customers that you do care about, that you do worry about, once they are off the phone you have no idea what is going on in their lives.    This woman on Saturday night had a great heart and I feel lucky to have spoken to her.  She told me, "There is only one race and that is the human race."  She spoke often about how people should treat each other well and decently.  This is important.  We are all here together, why make anyone's life miserable?  Blind hatred is something I never understood and I don't think I'll ever be able to.  Let's help each other.

      Alright, I admit it.  Years ago I had a thing for a certain guy and ever summer the feelings come back.  I haven't talked to him in over 4 years and I still think of him every time summer comes creeping up.  This song has nothing to do with summer, but it reminds me of him (he exposed me to it by singing it sweetly and full of emotion) and summer reminds me of him, so here it is:    You Move Me  Performed by Garth Brooks  This is how it seems to me Life is only therapy Real expensive And no guarantee So I lie here on the couch With my heart hanging out Frozen solid with fear Like a rock in the ground  But you move me You give me courage I didn't know I had You move me I can't go with you And stay where I am So you move me  This is how love was to me I could look and not see Going through the emotions Not knowing what they mean And it scared me so much That I just wouldn't budge I might have stayed there forever If not for your touch  Oh but you move me Out of myself and into the fire You move me Now I'm burning with love And with hope and desire How you move me  You go whistling in the dark Making light of it And I follow with my heart Laughing all the way  Oh 'cause you move me You get me dancing and you make me sing You move me Now I'm taking delight In every little thing How you move me   It's a sweet song from the Garth Brooks album, Sevens.  I used to listen to it over and over as I tried to fall asleep each night.  Unrequited love aside (drunk girl from karaoke, "I don't know what that is,"), it's a soft, happy song about how the presence of one person, or the thought of one person, can set your heart free.  I don't regret my feelings for this individual, I do regret never really telling him.  I'm glad I knew him and will carry those feelings in my heart for the rest of my life.    I have gotten over wanting to see him again.  Time changes everyone, I'm a different person now and I'm sure he is too.  I sometimes wonder how his life is going, but I don't need to be a part of it any longer.  I wish him happiness and I hope that he is spreading joy to those lives he is touching.    ** Side note, I don't like the spell check on this program.  If there are any apostrophes that are replaced with weird symbols, that's the spell check.  It keeps changing them into very odd looking characters.

      I just cleaned out the fridge.  Not too bad and I didn't really have much problem, until I found the 1/2 gallon of milk my roommate (who moved out last week) left in there with a sell by date of over 3 weeks ago.    I'm not trying to disgust anyone here, but sour milk is one of the three smells I just can't handle.  Even the thought makes me nauseous.  So I didn't open it and just threw it out.   I have an aversion to this smell so strongly that if I open a milk carton, I will usually throw it out within two days.  I can't drink out of it past then.  I actually like to buy the individual servings of milk because I can't drink it fast enough for it to not go bad.    I also have no idea why I decided to discuss this tonight.  I think I just wanted to start my train of thought with something.

      Here's a song that I love.  I think it defines true friendship.  It's wonderful and most people have heard it.  It's been covered over and over but it has a fantastic message about helping those who mean something to you.   Paul Simon & Art Garfunkel Bridge Over Troubled Waters    When you’re weary Feeling small When tears are in your eyes I will dry them all   I’m on your side   When times get rough And friends just can’t be found Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down   When you’re down and out When you’re on the street When evening falls so hard I will comfort you  I’ll take your part When darkness comes And pain is all around Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down Like a bridge over trouble water I will lay me down   Sail on Silver Girl Sail on by Your time has come to shine All your dreams are on their way   See how they shine If you need a friend I’m sailing right behind Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind   By the way, Dana just fell asleep and is snoring again.

      Yes, I know.  It's been a few days.  For those impatient people (Dana), I decided to take a moment to post something ("You NEED to post something" - DM).    The unpacking is going well.  I still feel like there's a ton to do (like updating my list of DVD's) but it's starting to feel like home.  I went to the grocery store with Dana last night.  I'm insane.  There's a reason why I only grocery shop like every 2 years.  I spent almost $200 and now I have lots of food.  But there's a ton of stuff I won't need to buy for a long time (spices, vegetable oil, etc).    Saw two movies since I last wrote.  Spider-man 2 and The Terminal.  Spider-man 2 was pretty good.  I think I like it more than the first, but they're pretty equal.  I liked the internal struggle Spidey had with being Spider-man or being Peter Parker.  It was dark but it showed a true side to the superhero (but he didn't whine, like that 5 for Fighting song - Superman.  I hate that song - oh, I'm miserable because I can fly and you just don't get it that my life sucks).    The Terminal was fantastic.  Tom Hanks was amazing as Viktor.  I will be buying this movie as soon as it comes out on DVD.  Of course, the Russian accent was a plus!  Adam came over yesterday to help me and took a bunch of boxes with him.  It was nice to have him come over.  It only took 4 times of planning it for him to show up.    My former manager called me yesterday.  Our team made our handle time goal (which rocks!) for the quarter and we're pleased.  He called to ask me to work 2 hours during my vacation.  I agreed.  I'm insane.  I agreed to come in and work two hours during my week off and what hours do I agree to?  The 9-11 PM Friday night shift.  That's nuts.  But it gives me time to do the stuff I wanted to accomplish tonight at work anyways.  I'm looking forward to it.  This is what makes me insane.    Dana is spending the weekend with me helping out.  We ate breakfast.  That's a weird feeling.  I don't think I've eaten breakfast in 3 years.  Last night at the movie theater I heard something strange that shows me that times have changed.  This kid dropped a hand mirror and his big sister said, "It's a good thing it didn't break.  That'd be 7 MONTHS of bad luck."  7 Months???  What happened to 7 years?  I guess things just aren't as tough as they used to be.    Well, we need to hit the hardware store, maybe go out to dinner with my mom and do some other random things.  Later!

      I love Kevin Spacey.  I think he's a fantastic actor but also that he picks great movies to act in.  A few of my favorite movies have Kevin Spacey (KS) in them and tonight I watched two of them.    The first I watched was one I just bought and had never seen before.  It was, "Glengarry GlenRoss."  KS plays a smaller role in an ensemble cast including, Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin, Alan Arkin, and Jonathan Pryce.  I originally was interested in this movie because KS was in it.  My manager (who ditched me by the way - see Black Thursday post) had recommended it for the sales techniques.    The movie follows salesmen who are trying to close the deal.  Good salesmen reach their goals.  Great salesmen can exceed goals and make a lot of money.  This movie focuses on great salesmen who are desperate to be back on top and will do anything to get there.  There is manipulation (not necessarily bad though) in some of the techniques to sell the real estate.  The important sales tips to take from the movie are:  ABC - Always Be Closing - assume the sale and make sure you get the signature on the bottom line.  Ask for the business.  Don't pitch the product and then forget to ask for the commitment.    Don't open your mouth until you know what you're talking about.  Don't present wrong information.  Sell what the customer wants.  Every product has different benefits and you have to make sure the benefits being sold (what is in it for the customer) match the person you are selling to.  A I D A - Attention, Interest, Decision, Action! This is important.  I don't know if anyone reading this has ever had a sales position, but you don't get anywhere if you leave any of these steps out.  Think about it. Here's a scenario: "I can save/make you money/time!" - You have the customer's attention! "This product/service will benefit you by ..., are you interested?" - You gain the customer's interest. "It's a great idea to have this product/service.  You made a good decision." - Gaining agreement from the customer is important. What happens if you stop here?  The customer said yes but you haven't closed the deal yet.  Action may be the most important step to any sales pitch. "Let's get you signed up."  (Or some variation of this.)  Don't sell something and then give up.  This is the hardest part for most people.  The hard part is starting the pitch.  Just think of every product/service as something that can actually help your customer.  If it won't help them, then it's probably not ethical to sell it to them.  If it will help them, then you are doing them a disservice for not mentioning it and getting them into the product.  Okay, now that I just went on about sales for a bit, I want to get back to Kevin Spacey.  The second movie I watched is one of my all-time favorites.  It's called, "The Big Kahuna."  I've probably seen this movie over 30 times.  It covers many topics and it is a simple movie.  There are only 4 speaking roles in this movie and one of those is a busboy with only 4 lines and about 30 seconds of screen time.   The movie stars KS, Danny DeVito (DD), and Peter Facinelli (PF).  They are three marketing representatives for a company that sells industrial lubricants.  Most of the movie takes place in the hospitality suite in Witchita, Kansas.  DD and KS are salesmen that are looking to land the big account.  They've been in their jobs for years and are classic salesmen.  PF plays the young, new employee for the company.  KS is Larry, DD is Phil, and PF is Bob.  This movie also talks about sales a little (not as much as "Glengarry GlenRoss") but the key is about how to do what you're supposed to.  Bob is a very religious man, Phil is semi-religious (the medium), and Larry is not anti-religious, but feels religion has it's place.  The place is outside of the company's business.    Long story short, the movie presents the issue that directing a conversation is the same as selling a product/service.  Bob ends up talking to the big account president about Jesus.  Larry is upset because Bob has not conducted the business that the company sent them to do.  There is a scene where Larry is yelling at Bob about how they were here to sell industrial lubricants and Bob keeps trying to bring up religion.  Larry insists that religion has no place in this business.    I am not an overly religious person.  I agree with Larry.  I wouldn't suggest bringing up the topic of Christ when trying to sell anything (be it a car, checking account, toys, etc).  The best part of the movie is after Larry leaves, defeated, not getting through to Bob.  Phil sits down with Bob and explains to Bob where his wrong was committed.  It was not committed in having faith, but in using his faith to direct a person and not being sincere.  He explains that as soon as Bob laid his hands on the conversation to direct it towards his interest, he was  selling  Jesus, not just chatting about faith.  Where Bob was wrong is that he was selling something other than what he was paid to sell.    I find connections between this movie and theme to my job at the bank.  We have bankers who sell products/services to customers for their benefit.  Something can be sold on every call.  The thing is, there are two salesmen on the line at all times.  The banker and the customer are both salesmen.  If the banker gets no product, the customer was successful with their sale.  Some bankers have a problem selling what the bank wants them to sell.  As soon as a person pushes a conversation in one way or another, they are selling their idea.  To be a successful salesman, you need to remember what you are supposed to be selling.    Both of these movies have some crude language.  "Glengarry GlenRoss" is stronger in the crude language department than "The Big Kahuna" is.  It's also easier to see the sales in GG.  TBK has more topics addressed and some truly remarkable performances.  I do recommend both of these movies.  Then again, I like movies that make you think.

      Tonight I want to post the lyrics to another Matchbox Twenty song.  I don't really feel this song in the way of a romatic relationship, but most of the songs written by Matchbox Twenty are more about relationships between people on every day interactions.  As with many songs, just a few lines stick out to me and touch my heart.  This song has a few of those lines.   Bed of Lies Matchbox Twenty    No I would not sleep in this bed of lies So toss me out and turn in And there’ll be no rest for these tired eyes  I’m marking it down to learning I am    Don’t think that I can take another empty moment Don’t think that I can fake another hollow smile It’s not enough just to be sorry. Don’t think that I could take another talk about it   Just like me you got needs And they’re only a whisper away And we softly surrender To these lives that we’ve tendered away  No I would not sleep in this bed of lies So toss me out and turn in And there’ll be no rest for these tired eyes I’m marking it down to learning I am  Don’t wanna be the one who turns the whole thing over  Don’t wanna be somewhere where I just don’t belong  Where it’s not enough just to be sorry  Don’t you know I feel the darkness closing in  Tried to be more than me And I gave ‘til it all went away  And we’ve only surrendered To the worst part of these winters we’ve made  I am all that I’ll ever be When you – lay your hands  Over me but don’t go weak on me now I know that it’s weak But God help me I need this I will not sleep in this bed of lies   This song is about trying and trying to make something work, a friendship, a romatic relationship, etc, but being the only one really trying.  It gets too hard to be the only one trying in a relationship and the person who keeps doing all the work can't do it for too long.  It's impossible to meet someone halfway when they're running the other direction but lying at the same time to make the person trying believe the work is worth it.

      Today was a good day.  Dana and I accomplished relaxing, scrapbooking, and getting food.  I managed to not really accomplish too much today in the ways of unpacking.  I did hang up shelving at least so I have a place to put some of the stuff I un-bubble wrapped today.  I keep looking around and thinking, 'Oh man, there's still so much to do.'  Eke!  We watched a whole lot of movies today.  That's what we do when we scrapbook.  Forrest Gump is playing now and Dana is enthralled.  I think it's been awhile since she's seen it.  I love this movie.  I think I could watch it every week.  Matt and I chat about this one often.  You know how certain movies have great soundtracks?  This one does and any of the songs will remind me of a scene from the film.  At the late night restaurant that Matt and I go to they play Musak and of course I comment every time that 'Against the Wind' by Bob Seger comes on.    We watched The Quick and the Dead earlier.  This movie is so cheesy that it's good.  The acting is fairly good (Gene Hackman is great in anything, Russell Crowe - oh, Russell Crowe) and the story line is enjoyable.  The only comment I have is about the director.  Now, the movie is done by the same director that does the Spider-man movies but his style seems a little off for a western.  There is a scene where a man gets shot and you can see his shadow.  This is not the bad part.  The bad part is the fact you can see the sun shining in through the bullet hole.  Just a small circle of light.  Why is this bad you ask?  Because it brings you away from the story and the movie.  It's cheesy.  Which works for some movies (Mars Attacks comes to mind).    Going to my dad's tomorrow and then karaoke.  I haven't really been able to enjoy the 4th of July for about 4 years now since I usually work (or help people move).  There's really no fireworks planned for my evening tomorrow night.  Oh well.    Dana wanted me to blog something.  Neither of us can remember what it was.  We're terrible with remembering stuff.  Dana tried to improve her memory by taking that gingko stuff but she kept forgetting to take the pills.    I go back to work on Monday.  I normally don't work Mondays but since the official holiday falls on Monday and I didn't have to work New Year's Day, it's my turn.  So I had 8 days off (except for the two hours I went to work Friday night) to work 6 days in a row.  The new quarter just started and it should be another good one.  My manager left for another team and we're kind of in limbo for the new manager right now.  Our team will survive, we always do.    That's all for tonight.  Nothing too exciting, just an update.

      Ever hear those odd stories about tattoos?  I've seen some pretty cool tattoos, heard many stories about them (hanging out in a pool hall for two years of your life will do that), and I have one myself.  (It's an emperor penguin and chick on my right calf.)  Last night I went out to the bar after work to play pool with my new manager, Andy, another team lead, Tommy, and a woman on our team, Cindy.  We had a good time playing pool and afterwards, Tommy, Cindy, and I sat down and we were talking about tattoos.  I'm not getting into too much of the conversation, but Cindy may have mentioned the most painful tattoo I could ever think of.  I'm not a guy, but I understand that guy's have a certain part of their body that would be extremely sensitive.  So this guy that went out with one of Cindy's friends a long time ago had the initials of L.E.  He had LE tattooed on that area that it would be pretty unique to find a tattoo.  The girl thought it was cute that he had his initials on his unit.  That sounds painful enough right?  That's not the entire story.  As it turns out, this guy had the tattoo done in such a way that when he gets hard, the LE would space out and the words 'Lick Me' would show up.  Taking aside anything about the tattoo itself, you have to realize the man would have had to been erect for them to tattoo this on him.  Talk about taking a sensitive area and making it more sensitive, then sticking a needle repeatedly in it!  Ouch!  This is starting to freak me out.  I'm fascinated by weird stories like this.  My friend, Karen, once told me about a guy she knew who was able to make another man lactate.  That's right, he made another man produce milk from his nipples.  Not a discharge, but actual milk.  My brain was instantly curious.  I wanted to know how men lactate.  Can it happen in all men?  Is it an arousal of the upper or lower part of a man's anatomy?  The way she described it, it happened during a sexual act and I was just curious (and completely freaked out) about this.  As it turns out, all men could lactate, most need help of hormone supplements to do it.  It is caused by deep tissue massage around the nipples to simulate a child sucking on the nipple to feed.  I guess it isn't as uncommon as one would think.  There are men who want to bond with their wives after childbirth and they will take the supplements to show that they too understand what it is to breastfeed a baby.  Then there are those who use it as a sexual act.  You learn something new everyday, don't you?

       We are all human beings.&nbsp; We all deserve the same basic, civil rights.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Dana has been posting lately and finding some great blogs about same-sex marriage.&nbsp; I'm not here to talk about same-sex marriage specifically.&nbsp; I think it's important to express your beliefs while treating others fairly.     &nbsp;   A few years ago (seems like forever and a day), a young man visited my home from Ukraine.&nbsp; I was just finishing my first year of college when he came to our home.&nbsp; The experience of meeting him opened my eyes to a world of diversity and love.     &nbsp;   People are different, yet we are all very much the same.&nbsp; We all want to survive, we all feel hurt when others inhibit our rights, and we all have connections with others.&nbsp; Andriy, the young man from Ukraine, opened my eyes more than I could have imagined.     &nbsp;   My parents brought me up to respect others.&nbsp; No matter what social, religious, ethnic, or political views others may have.&nbsp; I look at some parents today trying to teach their children diversity.&nbsp; I've seen people tell their children, "You can't say that.&nbsp; It's wrong to say that."&nbsp; What I respect and admire about my parents is that whenever they would see behaviors in public of people using blind hatred to hurt others, they didn't just say, "You can't say that."&nbsp; My parents explained to me that the behavior was wrong for more reasons than the behaviors being 'socially unacceptable.'&nbsp; They explained that it is not only wrong to  say  it, but wrong to  think  it.&nbsp; It was shown to me early in life that judging someone by their skin, religion, or sexual preference was wrong.&nbsp; They never said that one can't hold a grudge against another person, just that the grudge needs to be justified.&nbsp; If someone hurts you, you have a right to be upset with that person.&nbsp; How you choose to react is one thing, remember to keep a perspective.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I enjoyed Andriy's company while he stayed here.&nbsp; I cried when he returned home to Ukraine.&nbsp; What I learned from the experience of knowing him was that people are not that much different.&nbsp; Here was a man who was my age but grew up in a completely different environment.&nbsp; He watched the Cold War end, democracy come to his land, and watch his country form when he was 13 years old.&nbsp; When Communism fell, it wasn't happy days for the people of the Post-Soviet States.&nbsp; People had to learn how Democracy works.&nbsp; This might push a couple of buttons, but Communism is not all that bad.&nbsp; When there are corrupt leaders use the system to oppress people, it turns out poorly.&nbsp; But in Communism, everyone is considered equal.&nbsp; Every family has a home.&nbsp; Every person has a job.&nbsp; Every child receives an education.&nbsp; Every family gets the food they need to survive.&nbsp; It takes away the differences in economic structure.&nbsp; Now, this goes against the American Dream, and I'm not saying I'd like America to be a Communist nation.&nbsp; I'm just saying that when Communism fell, there were a lot of people forced into change that they were unprepared for.&nbsp; It was a tough time and I admire those who went through the turmoil.&nbsp; Andriy is one of my heroes.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Spending time with Andriy showed me that I could make a friend with anyone in the world.&nbsp; No more do I look at another country as the political structure that governs it.&nbsp; I see other countries as made up of people not so different from myself.&nbsp; People who have hopes and dreams.&nbsp; People who care about their friends and family.&nbsp; People with different cultures and customs that have come from the interactions of people.&nbsp; Where does culture and customs come from?&nbsp; They weren't here before people were.&nbsp; It's how people treat each other that becomes our culture.&nbsp; I have a strong set of values that form my beliefs.&nbsp; I believe that all people deserve fair treatment.&nbsp; I believe that all human beings deserve the same civil rights.     &nbsp;   The current topic of civil rights is same-sex marriage.&nbsp; Here's my questions and thoughts about the matter.     &nbsp;   Why does society/government feel the need to keep finding another group of people to discriminate against?&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; My mom told me that in the 70's, there was a speaker (whose name I do not know) she admired.&nbsp; One speech she remembers (30 years later), was called, 'We always need Indians.'&nbsp; (Granted, I never heard the speech, I don't know the speaker, and I'm relying on the recollection of a secondary source.&nbsp; I might be a little off on the title.&nbsp; But the meaning is still the same.)&nbsp; This speech was directed towards women's rights.&nbsp; The thing is, it will always be relevant.&nbsp; When this country formed, the colonists tried to oppress the Native Americans.&nbsp; This group of people were considered savage and dangerous.&nbsp; Once the Native Americans were not the 'big problem', blacks were treated poorly and forced into slavery.&nbsp; Our country has taken steps to changing it's ways.&nbsp; We now have protected groups that only need protecting because people were stupid to begin with.&nbsp; And you know what, we need to have protected groups.&nbsp; Because people as a whole are stupid and don't think before they act.     &nbsp;   I digress.&nbsp; Back to the speech.&nbsp; This speech pointed out that white men ruling the country have always needed to find a way to feel superior and people are hurt by their actions.&nbsp; Native Americans, African Americans, women, and the disabled have all fought their battles for the same opportunities that should be inherent.&nbsp; Why should a human have to fight for the right to speak up for themselves?&nbsp; Fight for the right of equal treatment?&nbsp; Fight for the right to love and express your love?     &nbsp;   Someone told me that they were against gay marriage because it goes against the definition of marriage.&nbsp; I looked it up.&nbsp; In Webster's New World dictionary, the definition states: "1.&nbsp; the state of being married.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; a wedding.&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; a close union."&nbsp; Wedding is defined as: "1.&nbsp; the marriage ceremony.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; a wedding anniversary."&nbsp; I think he was talking about his religious beliefs.&nbsp; Now, I'll admit, I don't go to church.&nbsp; I am not the expert on theology.&nbsp; I'm not an expert on politics, or anything really.&nbsp; What I can say is that this country was founded on the belief of freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and freedom from oppression.&nbsp; Since we can pick our religion, why should it be a factor in deciding laws?&nbsp; Just because one person's religion speaks differently about a subject, does that make that subject wrong?&nbsp; That's faulty logic if you believe that.&nbsp; Should a religious belief be the deciding factor in deciding the rights of all Americans?&nbsp; I don't think so.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Think back into history.&nbsp; Who are the men that come to mind when you think of poor human beings?&nbsp; Do you think of Hilter or Stalin?&nbsp; Why do we hate Hilter?&nbsp; Because he murdered people based on their religious beliefs.&nbsp; He had people murdered because they did not fit in with his ideal society.&nbsp; Those who were not murdered were tortured, punished, and oppressed for their beliefs, ethnic origins, sexual preferences, or disabilities.&nbsp; And if you ask around, people have a low opinion of Hilter.&nbsp; I want to ask the political men trying to oppress civil rights to same-sex couples if they would like to go down in the history books for holding the same views as Hilter.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I think same-sex marriage is something that will happen.&nbsp; People are going to fight on both sides of this issue, but think ahead 50 years.&nbsp; What will the children of tomorrow think when they read how long it took for society to recognize homosexuals as equals?&nbsp; It's the fight of today.&nbsp; It's a fight that needs to happen.&nbsp; Looking at similar fights from history, is there any doubt that this fight will be won with same-sex marriage being accepted?&nbsp; Making laws against same-sex marriage won't silence the population.&nbsp; There is a want and a need for equal treatment, equal rights, and that will not go away.&nbsp; It shouldn't go away.&nbsp; The fight will go on until the just action is taken.&nbsp; Who are the parties making this harder than it needs to be?&nbsp; It's not the gays and allies of gays.&nbsp; It's the politicians and narrow-minded individuals who think they are better than another human being because of their own preferences.&nbsp; It's a battle of blind hatred being fought all over the country.&nbsp; And the world.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I tried to discuss this generally and logically.&nbsp; Now I do want to mention something.&nbsp; I know two different same-sex couples.&nbsp; These couples are very different from each other and I love all the parties involved.&nbsp; They are my extended family.&nbsp; I want the best for them and I see no reason for them not to be treated the same as myself or the other people in this country.&nbsp; My friends are the most important thing to me.&nbsp; I will stand up against oppression not just because of them, but my resolve will be strengthened by the fact I know them and love them.&nbsp; They made my inherent beliefs a personal experience.&nbsp; And they have shown me that standing by is not the right thing to do.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   On a side note, to the random guy I overheard calling my best friend a derogative term while sitting with a group of his friends (a couple of these were women).&nbsp; My words to him:&nbsp; "Wow.&nbsp; You should think before you open your mouth.&nbsp; I understand that people have different views and you apparently have narrow-minded views.&nbsp; What I want you to understand is that you're discriminating against someone based on the way they walk and look.&nbsp; If I were to do that, I would say that you are an egotistical man who doesn't value the respect of others.&nbsp; You have now shown the group of people you are with how stupid you are.&nbsp; What are these women now thinking?&nbsp; I know I would be thinking, 'He just showed his blind hatred to a random stranger behind that person's back.&nbsp; What does he think of me?&nbsp; Why am I spending any time with this jerk?'&nbsp; Think before you speak.&nbsp; For your own sake."     &nbsp;   Okay, I know this was a long post.&nbsp; And the train of thought wanders back and forth.&nbsp; The main think I'm trying to say is to get the guts to share what you believe.&nbsp; You might find that others share some of the similar views.&nbsp; And talking about it will promote the discussions that need to happen.&nbsp; Diversity is good.&nbsp; It's what has promoted change throughout history.&nbsp;

      I haven't been writing as much as I used to. It's not because I don't have the time, I think I lost the patience with my computer. After about 10 tries, I actually got the Internet to pull up tonight. This is driving me insane! Oh wait, I'm already there.  I mentioned in a blog not too long ago that I moved recently. I think I'm getting way too used to having my own place. I still enjoy the company of my former roommate, but there's something about your own place that is just terrific! It's the first time in my life that I've lived by myself (besides the dorm). I can have room for my scrapbooking stuff, I can cook any hour of the night, and I can watch whatever movie I feel like watching at any time. Not that my roommate had a problem with any of this stuff, but you know how it is. You want to respect their space too and leaving junk around isn't courteous, banging pots and pans around at 2 AM while they're sleeping is not nice, and it's hard to watch the same movie over and over without feeling goofy.  You know what I love the most about my new place? It has nothing to do with being out on my own. It has nothing to do with the fact my drive to work is about 6 minutes long and a tank of gas lasts three weeks. It's not the fact the water pressure in the shower is better than I've ever experienced in my life. It has to do with my alarm clock.  My alarm clock (thank you Mom for the great Christmas gift) is one of those with a CD and I can pick which track to wake up to. Lately I've been awaken every morning by Rob Thomas singing to me. Ah, Rob... Sorry, I digress. The thing is, I'm not a pleasant person when I wake up and I don't function completely for at least 15 minutes. Usually about an hour. (Which is weird when I get to work and have only been awake for about 40 minutes. Caffeine is such a good thing.) Since I don't get up right away, I hit the snooze button quite regularly. At my old apartment, I had set up my room so the alarm clock was on the other side of the room. I used to get out of bed, walk 5 paces, push the snooze button, and then crash back into bed every morning. I would do this for over an hour. Now, the alarm clock is within arm's reach and it gives me an extra 30 seconds of sleep for each cycle! Yea!  What happens when you push the snooze on one of these types of alarm clocks, the CD stops playing but it keeps spinning. This means electricity is still going full force through the piece of machinery, which is not a big deal, but with this alarm clock, it picks up radio waves in the area and plays the sounds. Even if a certain station is not set, the radio will still play the sounds if the signal is strong enough. My former place was close enough to an AM station and so each day when I pushed the snooze button, Rush Limbaugh would talk to me. I became convinced that he was trying to kill me with his Republican propaganda. It is such a relief that I no longer hear voices talking softly to me while I'm half asleep. I'm pretty sure this is how brainwashing takes place.      One of My Obsessions    I'll admit it. I have a problem. I've been much better lately, but I still feel the pull. I'm addicted to office supplies. I just opened a drawer next to the computer from heck and realized the entire drawer was full of pens. Have you seen those commercials for the click Sharpie pens? I was speechless and I wanted to run right out to any office supply store to buy them. I have absolutely no need for them, but I WANT THEM. It's a disease.  In this drawer, I have every style of gel pen I've ever seen. The sick part about this drawer is the fact that I can't fit all of the pens I have in it. And you know what? I don't really like writing with pens. I like pencils. This is ultimately sick. What is even sicker is my desire to organize this drawer and test out each of the pens. I probably will freak out and do this soon. I'll keep records of it and you'll understand my obsession.  Dana said to me once that I can't do anything without going for the gusto. Take scrapbooking. I started for one Christmas present project and now my entire dining room is a scrapping room. I started rubber stamping (Thanks Kim!) and I bought about a gazillion stamps. I try to find ones that coordinate with scrapbooking.  I became obsessed with Clint Eastwood movies recently. Now I have two copies of "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly", as well as 14 other Clint Eastwood movies. I collect miniature liquor bottles. I have about 300 of them. I have no space for them, yet I still collect them. And then there's the penguins. I collect penguins. I have a penguin tattoo and my apartment looks like a rookery half the time. I need to get better at controlling the obsessive part of my personality. It's going to hurt me one of these days.  Okay, I'm signing off now. To stare at the pile of pens. More to come!

        I went on a blind date once.&nbsp; I understand why this is the worst thing anyone can hear.&nbsp; You know what I mean.&nbsp; The phrase, "I know someone who would be good for you."&nbsp; That's not fun.&nbsp; I hate it when people play matchmaker.&nbsp; I don't want to be paired up with someone a friend thinks "would be good" for me.&nbsp; What does that mean?&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I was in high school when my best friend, Liese (pronounced Lisa), decided it was time to set me up with one of her boyfriend's friends.&nbsp; This was a guy she had never even met and that may have been the first mistake.&nbsp; The other might have been the fact I was almost seeing someone else.&nbsp; I do not know what convinced me to say yes to the evening, but I did.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   It was January, 1996 in Minnesota.&nbsp; It was freezing cold outside and oh, so romantic.&nbsp; The evening before had sported one of the worst storms I've seen in a winter.&nbsp; It didn't snow.&nbsp; Oh, no.&nbsp; It rained.&nbsp; And rained.&nbsp; What happens to rain when it's cold?&nbsp; The rain turned to ice instantly when it hit the ground (and every other object).&nbsp; I was working part time at a local retail shop at the time.&nbsp; The ice came down so quickly that when I was sent home after a 1/2 hour of working, I needed a full can of De-Icer just to get into the car.&nbsp; The ground was covered quickly with a layer of ice and the trees all glistened the next day.&nbsp; The views were quite beautiful, just dangerous and hard to maneuver in.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   So, understanding what a fun driving experience it would be, I said yes when Liese decided to set me up with this guy.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Liese was dating Kevin and his good friend's name I'm changing to protect the guilty.&nbsp; Let's call him Bobby Ray.&nbsp;It just seems fitting.     &nbsp;   The idea was to go on a double date.&nbsp; Liese and Kevin were coming along.&nbsp; To add to the excitement, our other friend, Renee, was going to come with her boyfriend, Scott.&nbsp; Scott was a friend of mine and his best friend, Adam, was a great friend of mine.&nbsp; Adam also tagged along.&nbsp; That's right, 7 people on a double date.&nbsp; 7 people and I was the only one with a license.&nbsp; Keep in mind, I also drove an '87 Chevy Nova.&nbsp; This car would seat 2 people comfortably.&nbsp; If you had two smaller (for example, children under 5) individuals, the backseat could fit a couple more.&nbsp; All 7 of us were in one car.&nbsp; It was time to get friendly.     &nbsp;   I picked up Liese (two blocks from my place) and then went to get Scott and Adam (2 blocks from Liese's).&nbsp; Hindsight being 20/20, I should have stopped there.&nbsp; But no, I'm the perpetually nice one and I follow through with my word to Liese to try and enjoy the evening.&nbsp; It made the most sense to pick up Renee next, which meant heading north on the ice for a drive that normally took 15 minutes.&nbsp; After a half hour, we had Renee.&nbsp; Scott and Adam were the skinny little guys and they shared the front seat.&nbsp; (You know, the more I think about that time of my life, those two would have probably ended up as lovers if they were about 5 years older.)&nbsp; We then headed south past my home to Saint Anthony, Minnesota, which should have been a 25 minute drive.&nbsp; It took an hour.&nbsp; Having fun yet?&nbsp; I wasn't.     &nbsp;   We picked up Kevin and then Bobby Ray.&nbsp; I did try to keep an open mind about this date, but I'll be honest.&nbsp; My heart did not flutter when we picked him up.&nbsp; I thought, 'Okay, I'll see what his personality is like.'&nbsp; Why, oh why, did I bother?      What do high school students do for a fun-filled, wholesome evening?&nbsp; They decide to go to a local restaurant and order appetizers and split the bill.&nbsp; This is known as the cheap date.&nbsp; We decided to go to a local restaurant for some food (aka appetizers) and on the way there, my car got a little stuck on the ice.&nbsp; Remember the ice?&nbsp; I do.&nbsp; Clearly.&nbsp; I'm in a car with 4 boys and my car gets stuck.&nbsp; What do they all do?&nbsp; Sit there, on their butts.&nbsp; Bobby Ray decides to open his mouth with some wonderfully witty comment, like, "Ha ha.&nbsp; Oh man, we're stuck.&nbsp; Hee hee."&nbsp; My response, as nicely and sugary as I could say through gritted teeth, "Then get out and push."&nbsp; At that moment, I rocked the car free of the ice and we were back on our way.    Remember the stupid games you play as a kid?&nbsp; Like Truth or Dare.&nbsp; Now, I understand this is a 'risky' game to play but it never worked out like that with our group.&nbsp; We actually had a rule with our version of the game to keep it fair.&nbsp; You could not ask someone something that you weren't willing to answer yourself.&nbsp; The dares picked were always lame (yes, I use the word lame) because we did it more to get to know each other better.&nbsp; The answers always stayed 'in the car' and I think one of the best dares ever involved Scott howling at the moon.&nbsp; As I said, lame.    So we decided to play Truth or Dare.&nbsp; As we are playing, Liese and Kevin are holding their usual session of necking in the backseat.&nbsp; What does this wonderful 'date' of mine do?&nbsp; He wants to watch so he pulls out a miner's flashlight (you know, the ones that strap to your forehead) and turns it on so he can watch them.&nbsp;     What type of person carries a miner's flashlight in their jacket pocket?&nbsp; I need an answer to this question.&nbsp; This is not like having a pen in your pocket.&nbsp; I know the Boy Scouts' motto is to 'Be Prepared' but this is ridiculous.&nbsp;     As Bobby Ray is watching them make out, someone dares him to kiss me.&nbsp; It might have been Renee or Scott.&nbsp; Is it a wonder why our friendships have faded over the years?&nbsp; He looks at me, trying to strut his stuff as much as you can from the passenger seat of a Chevy Nova, and says, "I'm game."    Oh baby, oh baby, oh.&nbsp;     I politely make up a lie, "I don't kiss on the first date."&nbsp; Totally not true.&nbsp; I've never had an objection to a small kiss on the first date.&nbsp; Not like I've ever really had a relationship that started with a first date.&nbsp; Most of the relationships I've had, I've known the guy for at least a year before we even go out.&nbsp; This might also be a slight problem in my dating life.&nbsp; But back to the date.    I got out of kissing Bobby Ray.&nbsp; Thank you God.&nbsp; I mean that.&nbsp;     At this point, we pull up to the local restaurant.&nbsp; Since there are 7 of us, we get two tables pushed together in the middle of the place.&nbsp; Here is the seating arrangement:    Kevin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liese&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bobby Ray    Renee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Myself&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adam    This was so I could be forced to stare at Bobby Ray throughout our meal.&nbsp; I say forced because I did not want to stare at Bobby Ray.&nbsp; By the time we reached the restaurant and had sat down, I knew I was not interested in Bobby Ray and so pleased that Adam had tagged along.&nbsp;     We ordered our appetizer samplers (also, this is easy for girls to not eat as much, since they can just nibble from the tray).&nbsp; Bobby Ray showed his class and style by telling witty stories throughout the meal.&nbsp; Such gems are hard to forget.&nbsp; I heard every single penis joke I had heard from second grade through fifth grade.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; My heart was a flutter.&nbsp; Oh, how could I pass up this lovely, sophisticated man?&nbsp;     Bobby Ray also decided that dinner was the perfect time to start making fun of Adam.&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; He started ripping on one of my best friends and the boy I was ecstatic was there to save me from this torture.&nbsp; A word of advice to any man wanting my heart:&nbsp;Making fun of those I love the first night you met them or me is not a good idea.&nbsp; I'm pretty loyal to my friends.&nbsp; So we sat during dinner, Liese, Kevin, Scott, and Renee all at their end of the table missing the comic gems from Bobby Ray, Adam and I lowering our opinions of this boy every time he opened his mouth.&nbsp;     Finally, finally, it was time to pay the bill.&nbsp; The seven of us arose from the table and headed to the register.&nbsp; As we were paying, Bobby Ray found it socially acceptable to have his hands creep up from behind and start fondling Renee's chest.&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; He started groping her.&nbsp; I'll admit, Renee had a good rack for a teenager, but come on.&nbsp; She actually shrieked.&nbsp; Scott was pretty pissed off by this point and we quickly ushered everyone into the car.&nbsp;     Don't ask why we didn't drop this loser off right then and there.&nbsp; The only thing I can think of is that Liese and Kevin wanted to give the night another chance.&nbsp; The seven of us headed up to Renee's house, since she had the earliest curfew.&nbsp; When we got there, it was decided to watch a movie.    What movie is perfect for a romantic evening?&nbsp; What could possibly make the night better and better?&nbsp; I'll tell you.&nbsp;     Stephen King's TV mini series, "IT."&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; We watched a cheesy horror movie that did the book absolutely no justice what-so-ever.&nbsp;     Liese and Kevin found a spot on the floor to cuddle.&nbsp; Renee sat down next to her mom on the couch.&nbsp; Scott and Adam also headed for the couch while Bobby Ray found the only available chair.&nbsp; I stood there, wondering where to go.&nbsp; I knew for a fact I wanted to be away from Bobby Ray.&nbsp; Can you blame me?&nbsp; Do you think I was not giving him the proper chance?&nbsp; Is it wrong of me to pass judgment based on the miner's light, the penis jokes, the insulting of my great friend, and the groping of my other friend?&nbsp; Maybe it was.&nbsp;     Back to the fact I'm looking for a place to sit and watch the movie.&nbsp; Bobby Ray slides over and says, like one of those&nbsp;oily, sleazy men in a bar as they stare at your tits,&nbsp;"You could sit on my lap."&nbsp; His eyes drop a little and a sly little grin shows up on his face.&nbsp; Just thinking about it to this day makes me want to vomit.&nbsp;     Adam pipes up at this moment, and believe me, my adoration for him increased tenfold.&nbsp; "Hey, Scott, Renee, slide over.&nbsp; Beth, you could join us here."&nbsp; Thank you Jesus!&nbsp; Hallelujah!&nbsp; Hallelujah!&nbsp; The trumpets sounded and my heart wanted to leap from my chest.&nbsp; It doesn't seem like much, but I was so grateful for this simple act.&nbsp;     We watched half of the movie before we realized Scott and Adam should be getting home soon.&nbsp; It was time to head south again.&nbsp; Here's the adventure for the evening.&nbsp;     Remember the ice?&nbsp; How could you forget.&nbsp; I'm driving south on the highway, going about 50 miles an hour (the limit was 55, but I slowed down for the ice).&nbsp; A red light is coming up so I gently pressed the brake pedal.&nbsp; I didn't swerve.&nbsp; I didn't lock up my brakes.&nbsp; No, what happened is that my car stalled, still going 45 miles an hour.&nbsp; The light ahead is still red, I have 5 additional people (without me) in the car, no brakes, and cars are crossing the highway for their green light.    In one liquid motion,&nbsp;I put my left foot on the clutch, my right foot started pumping the brakes, I swiveled the steering wheel, and pulled the emergency brake.&nbsp; The Nova spun 270 degrees and came to a stop.&nbsp; We stopped in plenty of time for the light and no other cars were near us on the road.&nbsp; We were safe.&nbsp;     Liese and Kevin sat in an oblivious state in the back seat.&nbsp; I think they'd been smooching again.&nbsp; Probably.&nbsp; The looks on Scott and Adam's faces were remarkable.&nbsp; There was a slight bit of stun and a look of awe.&nbsp; I think they enjoyed it.&nbsp; Bobby Ray picked this moment to turn in his seat, look me in the eyes, and arrogantly say, "Way to go . . . Babe."&nbsp;     Now, my knuckles did not turn white from the adventure with the car.&nbsp; They now gripped the steering wheel because every bit of my being was holding them there so I wouldn't deck this guy.&nbsp; I hate, I hate, I HATE, pet names.&nbsp; If I know someone for a long time, I could handle maybe a couple of minor pet names, but there are an immediate pet peeve.&nbsp; There is only one that I can put up with because it is what my mom calls me.&nbsp; Babe is not it.    As daggers formed in my eyes, I glared at him.&nbsp; You know the look.&nbsp; Vivian Leigh had it best in Gone with the Wind.&nbsp; It's the look that says, "I want you to be wiped from existence."&nbsp;     I turned to Scott and Adam, my look softening greatly as I turned, and said, "Is it okay for us to drop Kevin and this guy off first?"    They both agreed and thankfully the rest of the night went off without a hitch.&nbsp; Scott got into a little trouble for curfew (I'm so sorry, to this day I'm sorry) and Adam got into a little trouble (for something completely unrelated to curfew.&nbsp; He'd been experimenting with hairspray and a lighter on the kitchen counter before I picked him up).&nbsp; Everything else was pretty much okay.&nbsp; I figured this guy was out of my life forever.    To explain how much I disliked this individual, here is a phone conversation the next day.    Ring, ring:    Me: Hello.    Guy: Beth?&nbsp; Hey, how's it going?    Me: Fine.  Oh God, why, why, why?&nbsp;  (Okay, the italics are what I was thinking.&nbsp; The tone came out the same.)    Guy: What are you doing?   Me:&nbsp;Cleaning my room.     &nbsp;   Guy: Are you really busy?     &nbsp;   Me: Yes.     &nbsp;   Guy: Oh.&nbsp; What are you doing tomorrow?     &nbsp;   Me: I'm in a bowling tournament.&nbsp; (Did I ever mention that I was a huge bowler in high school.&nbsp; I used to bowl 6 days a week.)     &nbsp;   Guy:&nbsp; Really?!&nbsp; What one?&nbsp; (Smile in his voice.)     &nbsp;   Me: It's a parent/child tournament.     &nbsp;   Guy: Maybe I could join too!     &nbsp;   Me:&nbsp; No, you can't.     &nbsp;   Guy:&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; (Confusion sets in.)     &nbsp;   Me:&nbsp;I'm pretty sure you have to be on a league.     &nbsp;   Guy:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I am.     &nbsp;   Me:&nbsp; Oh yeah?&nbsp; What league are you on?     &nbsp;   Guy:&nbsp; I'm on your team.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Long pause.     &nbsp;   Me:&nbsp; John?&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Guy:&nbsp; Yes.     &nbsp;   Me:&nbsp; Oh, I'm so sorry!&nbsp; I thought you were Bobby Ray!&nbsp; Thank goodness.&nbsp; How's it going?&nbsp; (Hear the smile in my voice now.)     &nbsp;   John:&nbsp; Man, I was really trying to figure out what I did.&nbsp;     The conversation kept on, but you get the point.&nbsp; I was rude, curt, and trying to get one of my great friends off the phone because of this guy.&nbsp; I ended up seeing the guy a few years later at something and ran the other way.&nbsp; The one blind date I ever went on turned out horribly and this is why I cringe every time someone says, "I know someone who would be great for you." &nbsp;

      Linking through different blogs is fantastic.  Tonight I found a few new sites that are just great.  I'm starting to read  urlLink Mighty Ponygirl Digest .  Lots of great information and the picture of President Bush is cracking me up.  I'm just thinking what Bush could do with that object in his hand.  Okay, I don't really like Bush.  That might be slightly evident.  I also like the site by Manjusha.  Check out  urlLink Far From Perfect .  I'm starting to read this one as well.  Lots of fun.  I'll never get anything done around my apartment with all this reading.

      I've mentioned before that I was upset with how small the windows and font was on my new computer. I was having the worst time trying to figure this out (that's how illiterate with computers I really am) and I finally asked this guy at work who knows more about computers than I do. Guess what? It was really, really easy to fix. Now I just have to get my printer/scanner working again and the speakers to play louder than a mouse. I'm so excited. The games on MSN (which I'm addicted to) are now larger than a 2x2 inch square. It's like 3x3 now!  I've probably mentioned this before, but I LOVE Conan O'Brien. Not stalking love, but just the humor behind this show is great. I work nights and don't watch much TV, but the fact that Conan is on twice each evening is so great for me. I'm watching a rerun right now but it's one I missed the first time out. Conan is now showing a video of his car. He's acting as if his 1992 Ford Taurus is the coolest car ever. The fact that the car is a stick shift makes me respect Conan even more! He just showed some guy that there are hornets nests in the trunk. And the great part is the fact the song they keep using is Simply Irresistible by Robert Palmer. He also just asked the Ferrari dealer how much crack he smoked this morning. Okay, I can't even concentrate on writing anymore. I would recommend this show to anyone. It's intelligent humor (most of the time) and always new. Well, that's my plug for Conan O'Brien for now.  Not much else to write about tonight. My brain is fried from work and I'm going to sign off.

      I do enjoy my new computer (except for the fact everything is really small on the screen. I need to figure this out). I'm finding that I can back up my entire CD collection on this computer (which after having CDs stolen before, this is nice). It's now so easy for me to surf the Web and log on to Blogger. I love it!  Since I have been meaning to figure out the add-ons to the blogging thing, I decided to search around a lot. I think I figured out the links now! Check out the sites I have under links. They're fun and ones I have to check out often. Dana will probably be helping me this weekend in making more improvements to the site.  Tonight wasn't too bad at work. I had a pretty good day. I recently got a new manager and a couple of new employees on the team, so I've been frantic lately. It's starting to settle down a little, but it seems like I'm being pulled in many directions at once and the feeling of being lost is starting to set in. I get home every night wondering if I finished everything at work. I need to stop thinking about it outside of the building.  Life in the new apartment is fun, but I'm finding myself making weird combinations for dinner. Tonight I had breakfast pastries and the left-overs of this pseudo pasta salad I made last night. Okay, it's not even close to pasta salad. It's basically pasta (that is a little bit underdone), cheese, and Italian dressing. It works for food though. I don't believe it would ever win any recipe contests. I made it because I didn't have any lettuce and I wanted Italian dressing. This is odd. I was craving a topping basically. I crave really weird foods.  I don't have a lot to write about tonight. Check out my new links!

      My mom called me the other day and this information was so heart-warming that I have to share. Sears is a great company. One of the people my mom works with confirmed this story and it is true.  With the war in Iraq, many members of the Reserves have been called to action and the companies are required to hold their jobs for when they return. This is all that corporations are required to do. Even though Sears is not coming out and saying they support this war, they are saying they support the soldiers in it. Not only is the company holding the jobs, they are paying the soldiers the difference in wages. That's right. The company is paying the soldiers the money they are losing for not working. They are helping to keep the families supported. It's a simple thing to do and Sears is getting great PR from it, but I would rather shop at a store that values its employees than one that does only what is required.  Moral of the story: Shop at Sears. They're a good company and the world needs more companies like this.

      I had a good day today. Ignoring all the crap I had to endure, I still had a good day. When I got to work, I realized that I had signed up to donate blood. This put me in a good mood. No, I don't enjoy needles in my arm, but they don't really bother me either. I find giving blood an uplifting experience. It's important to me to help where I can and giving blood is an easy thing to do. Heck, they give you cookies and a free soda when you're done!  There are some amusing things that happen though when you give blood. Here is my experience and what I wanted to say is in italics.  Nurse: Alright, I'm going to put the needle in your arm right now. Please look away. Beth (That's me!):  Why do I need to look away? I find it easier to deal with horror when I look at it in the face. Why do you think that Hitchcock movies are more frightening than Friday the 13th movies? It's because your imagination makes up a better monster.  Okay. N: That's done. B:  I'm glad. Thankfully you don't seem to have punctured extra veins and I'm not spilling my guts on the floor.  Okay. N: I'll be back in a couple of minutes. Delay N: Let's check how you're doing. Oh, good job! B: Thanks.  Wow! I can bleed. Hallelujah! I was so afraid that when a needle went straight into my veins that water would come out instead of blood. I feel so blessed!  N: Oh, I connected the tape to the chair. I guess you can't get up. B:  Um, I have a needle in my arm connected to a bag that's connected to the chair. I don't think it's the tape keeping me here.  Do people really think they can get up when they're giving blood? N: You'd be surprised. This kid jumped up once at a high school when his friend passed out. He ran out. B: With the bag of blood attached? N: Yes. B:  So, if you're taking the blood you just donated, is that stealing?  That seems odd. N: Yes. Look, you're almost done. Good job! B:  Okay, I know this has got to be a rough job. There's people who freak out at the sight of blood (like the woman they just took to the hospital apparently) but is 'Good job!' really appropriate? I mean, couldn't you say something like, 'You're almost done. That was easy.' Easy I could understand. Explain to people that this is not a horrific experience.  Thanks. N: What color bandages do you want? B: I don't care. N: How about purple? B: Okay.  I really have no opinion what-so-ever.  N: You're done. When you're ready, get up and get some food. B (arising immediately): Okay. Thanks!  I have given blood many times before. I took a break after I got my tattoo (because you can't donate for at least a year). I have never, ever had a problem. That's just me though.  I don't know if you've given blood recently, but they ask some interesting questions. The one I have always been curious about is the one that can be changed for gender. I always get, "Have you had sex with a man who could have sex with another man since 1977?" I always tell truth (which is no) but I think next time I should ask, "I know you ask this question because you're worried about AIDS, but you ask a question specifically about AIDS. Does saying yes to this question disqualify you from giving blood?" I don't think this is correct. Maybe you just need to explain, but here's the thing. What would be wrong with blood from a gay man? They accept lesbian blood. There's no questions like, "Have you had sex with another woman since 1977?" It seems like the question is directed incorrectly. And what is up with 1977? Maybe my understanding of AIDS is incorrect, and don't hate me for being blunt, but how long has the longest person with AIDS or HIV survived? Is it 27 years? I just need to ask more questions the next time I go.  Giving blood makes you aware of all the things that could have gone wrong with your life in the past. In the past 6 years, they've added questions about spending more than 3 months in parts of Europe (Mad Cow's Disease), visiting Africa (I'm sure this is an AIDS question too), West Nile Virus, and SARS. It used to be, "Do you feel good today? Have you taken aspirin in the last 24 hours?" I'm glad they have the protections in place. It just seems like a lot being thrown at you when you sit down.  At the end of the experience, you get to get stickers. I'm still wearing the "Be nice to me. I gave blood today." My favorite sticker I saw today was the one that matches the title of this post. "Are you my type?" It's surrounded with the different blood types (O+, AB-, A+, B-, etc.). It's really cute.  That was my adventure today. I learned that I have a skill because I can bleed!

      I am a compulsive shopper. That's all that's to it. Last night, I went out because the power went off in the entire city. I've been thinking about buying a new computer since my old one still ran Windows 98 and no longer wanted to pull up web pages. It had a lot of junk on it.  So I started by going to the bank and cashing in a ton of change (that I've moved twice and never bothered to cash in before - this is how rarely I actually go to the bank). Waiting for my dad to come home and help me with the whole computer thing, I decided to check out this scrapbooking/stamping store near my new apartment. It's not bad, it's just that I'm used to mega stores. It was quaint and I still bought a couple of things to help the business.  I went to my dad's after this and then we went to the store to LOOK at computers. That's right. LOOK. Well, I looked. I also bought. I decided to only purchase the tower. No printer. No monitor. I have those. I now have a computer at my desk with XP (which is driving me crazy!) and it's a lot faster. I'm trying to figure out all this stuff on it and I will eventually. I play on it enough.  The fun part of the adventure. When I'm setting up the computer, my former monitor wouldn't register. So at 2 in the morning, I went to Wal-Mart to buy a new monitor. It was a pretty good deal. Much cheaper than the computer store I was at. I still have to figure out the swivel base, but I will. My speakers don't seem to work as well anymore and I still need to do that. But now I can surf much faster and my computer plays music. That's pretty cool. =)  I'm trying to figure out links and stuff for this page. I did manage to add a counter today. I've had this blog for 2 months and I now added a counter. Be proud of me. I'm getting Dana to help me on Friday night with stuff. More cool stuff to come!  I'm off to work!

      I was walking into work the other day when a girl shared a story with me. It made me think of horrible things to say to someone to pick them up. The following is some of the worst things to say to a stranger whom you find attractive:  You look like someone who would know where the    correctional facility is  halfway house is  XXX porn shop is  strip club is  trailer park is  head shop is  drug rehabilitation center is  unemployment office is  pawn shop is  check cashing establishment is     Another weird conversation that I was told was from a guy I work with. We're trying to figure out if this woman was hitting on him or if she was just going a little bit crazy. Here's the conversation.    Woman: Have you seen my face on TV?    Man: Uh, no.    Woman: Are you sure?    Man: Yes.     Woman: My boss took pictures of me and now he's showing them on an adult film on public access.    Then she walked away. Here's my question. When did public access start showing adult films? I thought they only showed school lunch schedules and Trekkie conventions. Sure, there's the occasional high school choir/band concert, but porn? That doesn't happen.     Okay, those were just some of the random thoughts and conversations I had this weekend. Off to another fun filled week. And dealing with this computer!

       Okay, I'm officially insane and obsessive compulsive. I wrote a post a couple of days ago about a drawer full of pens and then this got me thinking about how to organize the drawer. So, I did. I came up with some numbers while I did it. Here they are:      53 - The number of mechanical pencils that I have   2 - The number without lead in them that I threw away   20 - Pencils, unsharpened - I do actually have an electric pencil sharpener, but I haven't plugged it in in 3 years   1 - Unsharpened pencil without an eraser   6 - Unsharpened pencils promoting Batman Forever (don't ask)   3 - Unsharpened pencils with polar bears on them - I think these came with a pack of penguin pencils and this just bothers me   12 - Sharpened pencils   2 - Number of sharpened pencils in cow print   14 - Sharpies   0 - Number of those cool clickable Sharpies   2 - Felt-tip pens   4 - Number of dry-erase board markers that I own without owning a dry-erase board   6 - Gel markers that didn't even work   1 - Crayon pen, it's blue - What is the purpose of a crayon pen?   1 - Pen that I bought in Germany 8 years ago and still works!   14 - Highlighters   3 - Number of highlighters that didn't work anymore   1 - Eraser pen - This is a pen length eraser   17 - Rollerball pens   5 - Number of Rollerball pens that no longer worked   154 - Gel pens   69 - Number of gel pens that didn't work   2 - Number of pens with the corporation name of where I work   10 - Markers   2 - Number of markers that didn't work   1 - Compass - I think I had to buy this for class 15 years ago   51 - Ink pens - normal, everyday ink pens   20 - Number of ink pens that no longer work      I did throw away any of the pens/pencils that no longer work. Now the drawer is only half full. There's a part of me wanting to go buy more pens to fill the drawer. I'm resisting...Until I find those really cool Sharpie click pens!

      I don't know what it is, but this time of year always reminds me of a certain someone from my past. I have not seen or spoken to this individual in almost 5 years, but I still remember the smile on his face and the horrible way we never got it together.  One night, when I was in high school, this boy, I'll call him Charlie, and I were hanging out, trying to figure out what to do. It was a summer night (school might have been out by this time), warm with a slight breeze. With no where to go the next day, we had time on our side and a night full of possibilities. We knew that Hale-Bop, the comet, was passing by the Earth. The bright idea occurred to us, 'Let's drive up north where there's no city lights and check out the comet!' In my head I'm thinking, 'This will be great! A long drive, an intimate conversation, then sitting under the stars. This is going to go where I want it to.'  Looking at Charlie, I can tell he's thinking, 'Hey, this will be cool. We'll be alone and what an opportunity.' There's a gleam in his eyes (remember the show Moonlighting? Where they had the attraction but it took so long for them to get together? This was my 'relationship' with him. If either of us had ever gotten the nerve to say anything, I'm pretty sure we would have been dating for a long time. But then, we're both chickens).  I start driving. We're heading off to see the comet (and hoping for so much more than an astrological event). The conversation was sweet, we always conversations that lasted for hours. We listened to love songs on the radio, I think he even sang along.  We get fifty miles away from home, the city lights are nil so we turn off to a back country road. Up ahead is a field, no buildings or trees to be seen. I pull the car up to the edge of the field and turn off the engine. Anxious, we both jump out of the car and start walking into the field. Once we're a good distance from the car, we stop and look up.  What do we see as we gaze into the sky?  A comet?  Shooting stars?  Constellations?  No.  We saw clouds.That's right. The sky was not clear that night. There was cloud cover and we had no chance to view the comet. We drove for an hour to see nothing.  Our hopes PLUMMETED.  Neither of us ever looked up before we left (or on the drive) to see if we could see any stars. We were officially morons.  We're not ready to give up on spending time together. We walk back to the car, our heads down in shame, shoulders slumped. We decided to go back towards home and do something else (I don't remember if we were going to go bowling or play pool or something like that).  Remember how we were fifty miles from home and on some back road in the country? Well, we got lost.  That's right. We got lost.  Up and down windy roads with absolutely no landmarks we drove.  We drove around for 45 minutes in the dark trying to find the highway to go home. Obviously, we eventually found it, otherwise I wouldn't be typing today.  Once we knew how to get home, the humour of the situation set in. (Yes, I spelt it that way on purpose.) I remember laughing the entire way home with Charlie. Even though we never saw the comet and never got our moment under the stars that evening, I remember just enjoying his company all night. This time of year reminds me of him and I smile.

      On my way to work today, I had to stop at a light. The car next to me (to my left) was being driven by a man appearing to be in his 40's. The backseat has a couple of little kids horsing around and there is a boy, I mean boy, in the passenger seat. This kid looks like he's about 15 years old, I'm assuming he doesn't drive yet and that his dad had to take him home from school or something. The kid has his baseball cap on his head sideways and my first thought is, "Look, it's the rebel from suburbia. He looks tough."  Since I'm looking around, being the observant driver, I accidentally made eye contact with this kid. My mistake. This boy starts looking at me, smiling, and he starts to roll down his window. That's right, a 15-year old boy started checking me out.  As my instant uncomfortable feeling set in, a miracle happened and the light changed. I held back and let the other car pull forward first. Since I was no longer next to the car, I see the window start going back up. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  It just disturbed me that a kid at least 10 years younger than I was checking me out. I feel icky.

      Ah, to be home from work. Here is something positive. Today wasn't so bad, I am just drained out.  First of all, I woke up and did not want to move today. I had really strange dreams last night (one where I was not in the dream, but watching other people's lives and this guy wouldn't marry this girl he loved because 52 generations ago their ancestors had been cousins and he was worried about inbreeding - as I said, strange) so I didn't sleep all that great.  I got to work and couldn't wake up. I just had problems with it. People are looking at me trying to figure out why I'm ready to pass out since it's 3 in the afternoon. Well, I find out that one of the bankers on our team gave her notice tonight. She had a family emergency and has to move to another state. I'm really bummed out about it. This is a person who is a friend of mine and I'm probably going to cry on her last day. I need to find all the boxes I haven't gotten rid of from moving to give her. Hopefully it will help her out.  I also got to spend time with another banker who was crying. That's right. I'm a team lead and the last two managers I've had don't really like dealing with employee's personal problems and I seem to fit this role better. I'm not down-playing her problems at all, I agree, they are something to be concerned about and I'm happy to spend the time helping out. I'm just saying that it is draining.  And now I'm home. I'm so glad to be home. I made a good dinner for myself (I'm doing that more and more now that I don't have to worry about waking up a roommate). I get to read blogs and post a couple of things. I really should work on a post for  urlLink Out of the Mouths of Morons . I started it last weekend and it's not ready to post yet. Maybe I'll work on it in a moment or two (or two hundred knowing my current motivation).  Best part of my day: I got to talk with my manager for about a 1/2 hour all about the Dark Tower series by Stephen King. This was spawned from the fact he knows I'm taking a day off of work to read the new book when it comes out. That's right, I'm taking a day off of work to read a book. I'm thinking about reading the first 6 books before the 7th comes out, but then I'll accomplish nothing else. So, maybe not. I don't know yet.  Alright, nothing too crazy for this post. Just an update. Later!

      Today was a pretty normal day for me. I don't work on Mondays (which is awesome!) and I slept extremely late as usual. I finally got out of bed around 3 in the afternoon (hey, I work nights! This is like a "day-timer" sleeping until 10 am). I sat around loading files from my old computer into the new one (like my entire CD collection - I love itunes). My mom called to let me know a package arrived at her house and that she was home from her weekend camping trip.  Motivation kicked in and I drove over to Mom's house. I got to see my dogs (I miss having them around all the time) and the cat that Mom rescued from the Twat (see Matt's blog about his 3rd most embarrassing moment and the title character for Matt's blog  urlLink The Window Licking Cat ). My mom and her boyfriend had spent the weekend camping in Wisconsin, got to see a couple of family members and visited the best meat market I've ever come across. My package was only one of the items I ordered, so I'll be visiting again soon. Mom also sent me home with about 10 pounds of fresh meat from this store (Leroy's Locker for anyone in Wisconsin). Yum!  Mom's boyfriend, Scott, showed me the array of fireworks he purchased. I'll just say, WOW! He is going to have fun finding a good place to shoot these off. I spent time chatting with Mom and holding my dogs. Well, Mom also picked up my dad some great food and on the way home I was dropping it off at his house.  When I got to my dad's, he told me some family news. My great aunt Marge passed away this weekend. I wasn't close to her, which is something I'll explain in a moment here. I think I only met her once at my great-grandmother's funeral in 1991. By mail, I did talk to her a few times and my grandfather kept in contact with her over the years. This is my paternal grandmother's sister.  I'm writing about this news because I am ashamed of the behaviors of a member of my family and I never want to become this way.  My grandmother, Gwen, is extremely stubborn. So was Marge, but not to the same extreme. My aunt, Becky, lived with Valerie (Marge's daughter) over 30 years ago. As roommates sometimes do, they had a small fight (no one remembers what it was about, it was that lame). Becky and Valerie didn't talk to each other for about 2 days. My grandmother got upset with Marge over this trivial thing and didn't talk to her for over 30 years.  At my great-grandmother's funeral, Marge walked up to my grandmother and said, "I don't want to keep this up anymore. I miss my sister. I'm sorry for anything that happened."  My grandmother turned her nose up and walked away.  Thirteen years later, Marge passed away. My grandmother's brother called and told the news to my grandmother and grandfather. It was my grandfather who passed the news onto my dad. I asked my dad tonight, "How did Grandma take it?"  His response, "Dad said she showed no emotion either way and that was it."  The thing is, if it had been my grandmother passing away first, Marge would have come to the funeral. She would have shown support to my grandfather and the kids. I didn't know her well, but what I did know was that she had a good heart and loved her family. My grandmother gave up knowing her only sister because of something stupid. It makes me really sad.  My grandmother has taught me in life to be stubborn. I know that I have a stubborn side. I've written people off before because of it. The only family member I use this on is my grandmother. And I still can't do exactly what she did. I don't have siblings, but I think that the bond should be stronger than that. I have learned a lesson from my grandmother and Marge. I hope that I never act as my grandmother did. I would be ashamed of myself.  That's all for now.
