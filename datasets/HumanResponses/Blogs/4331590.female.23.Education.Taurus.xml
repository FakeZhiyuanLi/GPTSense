      Hello everyone!  I have decided to abandon my new blog entirely and start all over again at blogger.com.  I hope you'll bookmark this site and read it frequently, because I'll try to write something everyday.    I don't want to say everything right now because I intend to send another REAL letter home this week.  I much prefer real mail to internet messages, and I like practicing my handwriting.  Plus, this time I will have some pictures to mail.  Daddy, Jared has gone to Poughkeepsie to pick up our new cell phones from UPS.  The delivery man came here 3 times last week and we never heard the bell.  I guess we learned an important lesson: never take a nap when you're expecting a package.  Anyway, I'm looking forward to having a new phone.  I'll try to drop mine in the mail to you tomorrow at some point.    My job is great so far, but of course I have not had to do any teaching yet (except for the drumline).  I really like the other people I'm working with, and at least the high school students are not too far removed in personality from Battle's and Pulaski's kids.  The socio-economic backgrounds of the band kids seem to be about the same everywhere I've been (except for Blacksburg, because they're so wonderful...).  There is a significant population of lower-class Hispanic students in Middletown, and I have not met any of those students yet.  Anyway, I've enjoyed the few things I've done so far with the job and I'm looking forward to getting going with the year.  I am taking a lot of advice from the other music teachers and from you all.  I have my first day planned out and I know what I want to cover with the 7th graders throughout the year.  I need to sit down and spend some time fleshing out my opening worksheet and "handbook" (syllabus) as well as compose some kind of letter home to parents about concert dates and practice records.  This is what the other directors are doing, so I'm accepting on faith that it's a good idea.    Aunt Terryl, I like your suggestions about handing out yellow and red cards and candy as a discipline trick.  I will try it and see how it works.    Do you think it is okay to send a kid to the office on the first day?  And if I send a kid to the office, how will I know if he (or she) gets there or not?  From what the 7th/8th grade directors tell me, their kids are awful at rhythm. So, my 6th graders are going to do rhythm excercises everyday.  We are going to do flashcards and flashcards and flashcards and composition and dictation and the whole bit.  They will grow to hate our rhythm excercises but maybe they will work.    I am going to go now.  Jared will be back soon with our phones and the car, and then I will drive to Middletown to meet with the high school choir director about some general music ideas.  He has taught the class before and should have some good suggestions.  Tonight I have marching band from 7-9.  Then I will have to come home and get into bed quickly: tomorrow begins my orientation!    In case you forgot, Virginia Tech is playing football this Saturday... GO HOKIES!
