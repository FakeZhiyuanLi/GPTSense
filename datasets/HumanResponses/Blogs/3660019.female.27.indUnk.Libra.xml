      Ok, here I am.  Someone had to remind me to blog... so here goes.  I'm feeling pretty good today.  I just bought that humongous Peds Nursing book I needed to have (2 weeks ago).. well, I bought it yesterday.  I started working on the 47 page take home quiz and worked for about 4 hours yesterday.  I got about 15 pages of it done (I skipped the hard ones...)  When I got to class today, I saw that some other people who HAD the book all this time aren't even as far as I am in it!  It made me feel like a SUPERSTAR!  Anyway, the bad news... for next week's test, ALL the questions will be straight out of the take home quiz.  So, like 50 questions out of about 1000.  Great.  Now I have to memorize the ENTIRE quiz, and who knows if the answers will even be right?  Matching vocab... OMG, I have to memorize about 400 vocab words and definitions by next Tuesday.  Then study all the rest of the damn thing.  There goes my 93%.... Gosh, what else do I have to blog about?  I have a headache, my wonderful little progesterone pills are making a steady stream outward (sorry GROSS), is that EWCM I see mixed in with it?  It's definitely stretchy on the pantyliner??  Kinda crampy, but that again is the progesterone, I keep telling myself.  Don't test, you are only 6 DPO, I say...  (Oh, and btw, I know I'm 6 DPO today because I read Grace's Roll Call post, and she put me on there again! It's kinda nice when I have to rely on someone else telling me how many DPO I am...) I feel like I did the last two months, you know when I conceived but NADA??  So, we shall see.  Fingers crossed?  Check.  Progesterone on board?  Check.  Stomach in knots?  Check.

      First off, I am also pissed off at my mom.  I have exactly one million things to do today, the most important being buying a textbook.  I absolutely have to get the book today.  Well, my mom got dumped on this am by my older sister (who is a tramp-bitch, I might add) and mom got stuck with her 5 yo daughter Marlee, who is ROTTEN to the core.  I really love the little girl, but, to prove my point,the reason she is at mom's today is because my sis took her to daycare and her friend Quinn wasn't in daycare today, so Marlee didn't want to go either.  SO, my ever indulging sis dumped her on my mom.  My mom, who can't say NO, and who wouldn't anyway, cuz my sis had driven all the way to Parsons with Marlee to drop her off (bout 30 mins away from her daycare...).  Mom wouldn't have told her no because that would mean Paula would have to drive back to Bartlett and drop her off, and then BACK to Parsons to work.  My sister... good god- I'll save that for another blog.  Well, my mom shows up just as I'm about to leave for my one million errands and says she has an appointment in Pittsburg (another nearby town) and needs me to keep Marlee.  Right, like I'M gonna say no.  Then I have to help mom put oil in her new Rendesvous because she can't figure it out...  So, I help my mom out, cuz I'm a good daughter.  Well, back to SPOILED ROTTEN Marlee... she's a PITA because my sis doesn't know the meaning of the word discipline.  There's NO WAY I can take my kids plus my neice to the college campus and bookstore to buy my textbook.  That is one terrible situation waiting to happen.  So, now I'm mad and I've decided that I can't run any errands like I need to- cuz I'm a big baby and I haven't learned yet how to make the best of a bad situation.   Scratch all that, I'm about to take my DD to the doctor's office.  We're having a problem today that I'll blog about later.   So long, my friend Katie!

      I really don't like the post-O period.  After I Ovulate, there is nothing to do but wait.  I'm just waiting for the day when I can test.  Waiting, waiting, waiting.  It's not like there's anything to test for this month.  I am pretty sure that after concieving for two months in a row that I won't be lucky enough for a third.  That just defies the odds.  Well, that works out, though, cuz Katie's chances aren't too great this month either, with her vacationing and all... so we'll have yet another month to wait.  I'm still a little drained from all the drama a few weeks ago, and I'm not up for any more of it- I don't want to see 2 lines this month.  Two lines used to equate joy, hope... hell, it was the most exciting thing in the world before the miscarriages.  Now I am hoping for 1 line; it's easier to deal with.  I wish I could wake up one day and be like 12 weeks pg.  I hate all this waiting and worrying- and TRYING.  God, I just went back and read this, and I'm SO negative.  And I'm sitting here trying to figure out how to bookmark this without Dan coming across it.  It would break his heart to read this, and I never want that to happen.  That's why this is for KATIE'S EYES ONLY.

      Well, Katie, I've done it.  Here is my very first blog, just for you, dear.    I have no clue what to write, except for I am getting sure-er by the minute that I am Oing right now.  Talk about perfect timing!

      Katie, I hope you see this as soon as you get home! (like you don't have better things to do!)  I was thinking all day that I was 14 dpo, but I just figured it up and I am 15!!!  I have NO signs of impending AF, and BFN's from the Ebay tests.  I'm running out in the morning for more tests.   I'll let you know!  (Don't get too excited yet, because it could be the progesterone is prolonging this.....)
