        When I was growing up, it was impressed upon me that I would someday get married and have children, because that's what I was supposed to do. That's what WOMEN do. I have learned a lot of things since then and actually spent a lot of time in denial about what I wanted to do when I "grew up". I spent a good deal of my adolescence and young adult life saying I would never get married and DEFINITELY never have children. Here I am at 27-- 28 later this year and my biological clock is ticking REAL DAMN loud. This makes me think, maybe saying I didn't want to be married and didn't want to have children was just me rebelling against the belief system and morals that I felt were being pushed on me by my parents.    Looking at it now, I realize in all honesty, I DO want to be married someday. Maybe not in the white wedding, fru-fru dress and any marriage vows involving the word "obey", but I DO want a long-term, loving, complimentary relationship in my life, whether or NOT the terms of which are legally recognized by any body of governement is neither here nor there with me. I want a partner someone that is my equal, someone that loves me truly, madly, deeply all the way. Whether they are male or female has yet to be seen, my reality is flexible. I am not into the "contract" I'm into the mutual love and respect factor.    As for children, well, I always say that if I ever turn up pregnant it's the universe telling me to take the hint. Which I would happily DO. That's not to say, I don't practice birth control, I DO, religiously-- and that doesn't mean once a week on a Sunday-- but if I did ever come up with two lines instead of one, I would prepare myself and my life-situation as best I could for the arrival of the being I would be dedicating my life TO. . . and I would try not to screw up as badly as my parents did with me. That might sound harsh but trust me, it's not.    I can still hear it ticking but the future is still wide open and I am willing to wait for something that might never come. . . for now, there are still plenty of options, and the world is wide.

       There are things in this world that make no sense. The mistaken belief that we live in a "free" society haunts me. The fact that we are not allowed to mind our own business. The fact that globalization will lead to monoculture as we become more and more dependent on technology and as this occurs we become more and more alienated from our fellow beings. We are under surveillance and if you don't believe that maybe you should start counting the number of cameras you walk passed everyday. I want this to be a place that while it may not make a lot of "conscious" sense it might appeal to others in an "unconscious" way.
