      I've never had a blog before but have been to many.  I thought that I would give this a try and see if I like it.  I will be trying to make at least one comment every week.  I'm a busy person you know so that is all I can commit to.  You are more than welcome to leave a comment but don't expect an answer back right away.

       urlLink    Puppy is now 5 weeks old.  He is soooo sweet.  Getting around really good now and starting to get into mischief.  He likes to chew on things even though he has no teeth.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    He especially likes to chew (gum) on peoples fingers. His tail is also starting to curl up now and he likes to lay on his tummy with his feet out behind him.  I haven't seen it yet but they said that he likes to lay on his back and sleep too. &nbsp; urlLink

      I got back Sunday night about 8:30pm.  I can say that I was and still am very tired.  Loved the weekend.  Lots of wonderful information about how to walk with our God and the blessing we receive for doing so.  I definitely didn't get enough sleep especially Saturday and Sunday night.  So, that is all I am writing for now until I can get some more much needed rest.

      As you can see by the pictures below, we had a great time and beautiful weather at the beach yesterday.  I was just too tired when we got back to do anything more that send the pictures to the blog. Saw a really nice crochet serape and got the idea of starting to make one myself.  Leaving on Thursday for a convention in Tacoma so I am not sure how much time I will have to write anything until next Monday. If I don't get back to say anything before then you all take care and will post something when I get back.

      If you don't have yahoo messenger, get it!  This is the best one that I have seen to date!  It has some great new features.  To name just a few: Avatars, IM Vironments, Funny audibles that you can send to friends and Lanchcast radio.  Now this last feature is great.  I can listen to the radio, the music that I choose and it shows what I am listening to on friends IM's and I can see what they are listening to if they choose to let me see.  I like that feature because if I see something that they are listening to, I can click on it and it starts playing on mine.  Cool huh! You can also share pictures easily in one of the invironments.  Anyway,  when you get it.  Let me know and I will give you my messenger id and you can add me.

       urlLink    Here he is again. He definitely likes to be held instead of being left alone. I almost didn't get this picture, he was busy looking for those warm hands and bodies. Since he is the only puppy in the litter, I think he will be a very affectionate lap dog. This picture was taken on June 10, 2004 &nbsp; urlLink

      This is our Maltese puppy below. He was born on May 26th.  We don't have a name for him yet. We hope to bring him home in about 5 to 7 weeks, depending on when he is ready to leave his mamma, then after watching his antics for awhile we should be able to come up with a good name.  I've done some research on the breed and there is a lot to learn.  But I am ready.  It has been too long since I last had a dog of my own and I really miss having one.    He looks very fat and already makes little growling noises when he wants to eat and you don't take him back to his mamma.    I am going to keep a picture album going to show his growing progress.  I know that I am more excited about this than my kids are.

      There is a link to the left that will allow you to subscribe to my page.  That way, if you wan't to be notified when I make updates, it is done automatically through blogarithm.  It will send you a confirmation email and then you create a password so that you can delete or add subscription as you see fit.  It is a great service.  I am testing this out right now to see if it works.    Also, you will notice that I am having a problem with my page.   I added an adopted pet that it to big for his spot.  I have emailed the maker and am hoping that there will be a way to make it smaller.  If not he will have to go.  I would hate to get rid of him.  He really is fun.  You can give him a treat.  Make him jump for it. Just click on the box, then tease him with it and left click your mouse.  He will jump to get it.  Have fun.

      My mom and dad had a fire.  Some one was lighting off fire works in the street behind there house Monday night.  Someone else, who was apparently a friend of the boys, was trying to be funny I guess and lit a toilet paper roll on fire and threw them in the arborvitae bushes along the back wall.  It caught them on fire and then the person who did it too off in his car. The boys that were lighting off fireworks, saw it and called the fire department, then ran over and pounded on the door and tried to get my mom out.  They couldnât speak a word of English but did manage to say âFire!â  The neighbor lady came out and told my mom to get out because she could see the flames over the house.   She practically had to pull my mom out.  They got the fire out before it caught the house on fire but the damage is done.  The bushes are gone.  I was up there today helping dad put them in the dumpster after my brother Bobby cut them down with his chain saw.  Hard work.  The siding is all buckled and one window broke. A lot of the other plants and bushes are ruined too.

      My picture is going to be in print.  I took a picture of my son a couple of years ago when we were camping.  I always liked the picture and there was a contest so I decided to give it a try.  They want to put it in there book!  I was excited, even though I think that it is mostly about trying to get money out of me.  Which they haven't yet.  Anyway,  the Link above will take you to where it is.  For some reason, some of the things don't work when you get there. Like the Send a free E-card.  At least it didn't work for me.  Give it a try and let me know if it worked for you.

      I just thought I would right a little note and let you all know how Tuff is doing.   First:      Potty training is going a little slower than expected.    He is getting closer. He runs to the door sometimes but we dont always see him. So he has an accident and then barks to let us know he did it. He lays there and looks at it knowing he wasn't suppose to go there but couldn't help it. We are trying to teach him to bark at the door when he has to go out. Hopefully he will learn that soon.   Second:      Sleeping arrangements are finally figured out.    We started out with me on the couch and him in his kennel next to me. No sleep for two nights that way. Then we moved to the bedroom. He in his kennel again but he was still waking up and crying a couple of times a night. I knew that he could hold it, so we then moved him to the Utility room. About 3 in the morning he would start crying. So I would get up and let him outside. Then it was back to bed. Shut all the doors because he thinks that it is time to stay up and isn't happy about going back to bed. I brought him back in our room 3 nights ago, and he has slept the whole night since. He just wanted to be close to his mama. He is definitely my dog. He will play with everyone but it is me that he wants to be with all the time. Everyone else seems to be a little put off by it. I can't help it. I'm the one who does almost everything for him.   Third:      Puppy shots!    Poor Bruce, he has such a soft heart, he just hates to hurt anyone especially a little puppy. But, he had to do it. I can't do it. I can't stand needles at all. The first time he did it was the worst. He poked once and then pulled away and cringed. Then did it as fast as he could. This last time went much better. He was very speedy which made it easier on him. Only two more times. You can do it honey!   Fourth:      Tricks!    Can't believe how smart this puppy is with tricks. I taught him how to sit, sit up, lay down(needs a little work) and pray! The last one is the cutest, if you can get him when he isn't overly excited. I lay him back on my knees when I have my feet up on the foot stool. So he is on his back leaning up. Then I point my finger at him like a gun and tell him "Say your prayers!" He will put both of his front paws together and bark. When there is too much going on or too many people watching he just barks and bites your finger. I will try to get a picture of it when he is better at it. Well, thats the latest on Tuff. Enjoy all the pictures that I posted today.

       urlLink    Anna looks like her father.  Big beautiful blue eyes and she too has a great smile but doesn't like to show it much.  urlLink

       urlLink     Anna is acting just like her daddy when he was a kid.  I don't think my mom ever got any good pictures of him because he was alway making faces.  I had to post this because I just think it is too funny to not show everyone. urlLink

       urlLink    Larwood Bridge in between Scio and Lebanon, Oregon.  This was just one of about 4 covered bridges that we saw last Saturday.  We road the motorcycle with our friend, Jeff who lead the tour.  He is a Great Leader!  urlLink

       urlLink    Shimanek Bridge in Scio, Oregon.  Another bridge on the tour.  I like this one the best because it is red and looks different than all the rest.  It was built in 1966.  Not as old as the rest, which were build in the 30's.  urlLink

       urlLink    Bear and Tuff.  urlLink    Tuff is trying really hard her to kiss up to Bear.  As you can tell, Bear is a little disgusted with him.  He is probably thinking to himself "Just one more inch and he's getting my paws across his head!"

       urlLink    Tuff tackling our cat Bear.  urlLink     As you can see Tuff really thinks he rules the roost.  Now you know why we call him Tuff.  He is only as tough as he thinks and sometimes Bear has to put him in his place.  He is very fortunate that Bear is a pretty layed back cat.  He is 14 year old this year. So I would say he is beight pretty good having to deal with a 10 week old puppy.
