      Well,at around 7:00 Sam called and said her and Patrick were coming over so they came over and we walked around the block and Patrick told us to sit under Mark's porch cuase he thought it was going to rain, and of course. It did so we sat under tehre and talked, Sam and Patrick are so gross. Since it's my parents anniversery they were like  "I bet they're fucking"  ewwww.. disgusting. Anyhow, it poured for about ten minutes and then we got up and decided to go walk to the construction site cause Sam had to crap....I can't trust her in my bathroom..and so we walked back there and got totally soaked in the creek, and then we went a different way so we came up behind the port-o-pottie's.. While sam was taking a crap Patrick and I ran deeper into the woods and watched her look for us. It was hilarious. That went on for about fifteen minutes, Sam sitting in a tractor trying to turn it on and Patrick and I running around the construction site stalking her. Patrick and Me gave up and then watched Sam trying to get another bulldozer to work. And it turned on and started beeping, so we hauled ass, and it stopped after ten seconds and we wrote  "naughty things"  on the little windows of the tractors and then went mud sliding on the cement thing for a new store they were going to put up. By then our shoes were mud coverered so I was just like  "screw it"  and sat in the water, and then Sam and Patrick kicked water at me, so we got into a water fight. After a few more minutes of trying to start bulldozers we walked to De Zavala, Patrick had seventy collars...for God only knows what. And he and Sam were being disgusting little sluts behind me..only joking though...and he goes  "let's go to Krispy Kreme...'  so we went there and we were soaked, muddy, and smelly. We got six doughnuts and two water and an orange juice and ate there and everyone was staring at Patrick and Me with those krisy kreme hats on. Good times. Anyhow, after that we walked down the highway to Ihop, we walked through the parking lot and Patrick kicked this bottle full of blue stuff at me. I got sticky and smelled of bubble gum so I was like  "Lick it Offf!"  and he grabbed my leg and licked my pants, then told me to go in and ask someone how old you had to be to work there. I freaked out cause these people were looking at me..and that pisses me off..and Patrick asked for me. You've got to be sixteen..I could get rich at Ihop..ohh man..  Then we made our way to Wal Mart and went shopping. Patrick kept on saying  "you fucking whore"  or cussing really loud, and I hate it when people cuss really loud in public places, so I kept on pinching and slapping him. He was going to die his hair with Sam, but gave up and we put everything back. After that we went to the crafts, and got some things for Sam and Patrick's spells..We left and my Mom called and wanted me back by ten, and I said five extra minutes then hung up. And looked over at Sam and she ran into one of those toy pully things, and she complained that it ate Patrick's quarter. And Patrick was getting a drink and it ate his money so the two of them are running into the machines. It was hilarious After we left Patrick put on this glow stick and we decided to go through hart ranch, and it was around 9:40 at night and we walked through those new stores on De Zavala, and Sam tried to work a tractor again, and Patrick and I walked off. and we both stopped in the middle and saw this...thing..and I freaked out and wanted to see what it was, but while we were looking around a truck stopped at the corner of the street and was like..watching us. I felt weird and asked Patrick if he felt weird and he goes  "yeah"  so Sam came and she stole a tool kit from the Tractor and tried to put it in Patrick's wal mart bag...That's the first time I've ever seen the two fight like a married couple. Anyhow, we walked towards the truck instead of going back in the woods because Patrick and I didn't feel to good. And they were like..picking seeds off of trees, so we shrugged it off and went through the entrance of Hart Ranch...we walked around and I stopped and looked up and we stared at the last clouds I saw a bunny. Sam saw a dog, and Patrick saw a demon eating a baby...dear God. He's fucked up. We kept walking and he tried to lick me..and I was like  "I'll bite you!"  and he's like  "go for it.."  so f course, I grabbed his arm and bit his wrist..really hard. Heh, he smelt like the candy perfume I sprayed on him at wal mart. And he pushed me away, and all the time we were walking Patrick and Me are avoiding Sam's spiked bracelets, I've got major cuts from those bitches. We almost got lost but found the ditch thing with the barbed wire, nails, and the fence thing bolted into the Cement. First Sam went under the barbed wire to block off that little..ditchy thing, and then me and Patrick and a women saw us and Sam was trying to hop the barbered wire, bolted, nail covered fence, and Patrick and I were running so fast, and our shoes were wet so we made highpur noises. Haha, then the lady left and we tried the other side, and pulled the barbed wire off the fence. Sam went first then PAtrick and then me. I got stuck on the nail with my chin and hoped off and grabbed my bag and we went our seperate ways. Haha. Well, it didn't end there. I promised Sam and Patrick some cigs, and they'd been wanting Marlboro so I gave each of them four through my window and Sam came up to my window and looked in my room and she's like  "You're rooms clean!"  and I'm like.. "dude..I know..."  and I wanted to show her whereto get the Marlboro's if they ever wanted one but my mom started coming up the stairs, so I shut the door told them to run and reminded then if the blinds are closed, don't knock or throw. And shut the blinds and went down stairs.  I found out my dog tried to eat my sisters cat too..Pfft..good daisy! ^^ I'm dooone! I'm highpur! isn't it lovely!
