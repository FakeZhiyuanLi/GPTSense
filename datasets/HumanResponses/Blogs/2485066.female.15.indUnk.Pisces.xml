      Today I went to the funeral of Angela Cruz Stapleton.  Well when me and my mom first got there I was just looking around then went to talk to Mr. Stapleton.  I went up to him and im said im soo sorry for your loss and he was like oh thank you Caitlin, its a surprise to see you here, but thanks, you have a good heart.  I also started crying.  But then I went to go talk to Usha and we talked.  We went to go see Angela's body.. We both wanted to but were scared, but we went anyways.  She looked so peaceful, she didn't look dead she just looked like she was sleeping.... A long sleep that she wouldn't awake from.  We went to go sit down and we just started talking, sharing our thoughts and feelings, and stories about things until the service started...  Mr. And Mrs. Stapleton went up to talk.  I can't image how hard that would have been for them, they tried their hardest to keep a straight face, and how back the tear, they tried to be strong.  But it didn't work, and that's good... Its never a good thing to hold back your tears.  Its like when you cry, all of your sadness and worries just flow right out of your body.  When they were talking I almost started crying.  They were saying some of the memories they had of her.  She was so smart and full of life, and her imagination was huge and bursting with life. All of the cute stories made us laugh but also made us sad, sad that she was gone, the world need more people like her, just full of life, full of jokes and cheerfulness, and full of positive thoughts.  When the preacher, or priest went up to talk is when I started crying.  I started when he was talking about the memories, of how the parents knew that their little Angela was going to die.  Of how when the little girl was put in the ambulance, Mr. Stapleton said please let her end her suffering, or give us a miracle.  after the service we went to the room with all the people to eat and talk.    me and Usha went to talk to mr. stapleton then we left.  we went to the rockola cafe.. if thats how you spell it.  we got a monster, order of loaded cheese fries, lol and i got chilli and Usha got a salad.  OMG the cheese fries were soo good!  and we learned that the uniforms at the restraunt are very.... well.. skimpy lol the girls wear the smallest shirts ever! then we went to see her brother and then look at clothes in the shop next to it.  then we took Usha home and i got to see her kitty! hehe!  well when i got home i got to  go pick out a christmas tree and i finally got to get the one i wanted for once.  we got the man to lower the price like 10 or 14 dollars and he was like well, ya'll seem like nice folks and i was like so do u! thanks! and my mom started laughing i can't see why its so funny but oh well!  so now im home talking to people, writing in my blog, and freezing my ass off. i finally get to go get my pictures developed of me and emily which is what imma do right now...   oh and usha is my Duckie or Duck and im her crab fritter! i will be back later!! IM me if you wanna talk... MissCoquettish44       oh and there is something that really sucks... i think johnny is mad at me and i don't know why and immma cry cuz he won't tell me why... i feel like shit.. and im sorrry for whatever i did wrong! so plzz tell me what i did.. please!!!!!!!!!!!   ~!~ I LoVe YoU mWaH ~!~

      Ok my day was so so today... It wasn't too great to begin with I guess... But me and Jessica made up so that was good...And English was like.. Erggg made me mad, it like urgg we did a jeopardy game and David and Ben started like arguing well Ben got an attitude so I just got frustrated LOL.... Well Justin and Johnny made my day today. Well Justin because he always kept tickling me and I hate that but it got me to laugh and smile.. And squeak! LOL its so great but its not funny. He also made my day because he let me put makeup on him.. Well just like eyeshadow on one eye, lip stick on his bottom lip, and glitter on his right hand and arm.. LOL! And Johnny made my day b/c... He did a favor for me.. And I thank him a lot! LOL... Urggg well its Friday! Ok not so bad right? Wrong! im going to be so bored this weekend.. All I know that im gonna be doing is going to the movies with chase, his friend and one of my friends, and then i might go to the mall with Ali on Saturday I think.. It will be sooo fun!! But other than that imma be cleaning my room, working on Christmas presents, and... Studying Urgg I hate to study, but I must if I want to do good right?   I found out something today.. I found out that I really do care what people think but then again I don't. It all depends on what the topic is... Well I really do care what people think about me like as in personality kind/kind not.. Its all confusing, like I say I don't care but then when some one calls me a slut I get all piss well.. It depends on who it is sometimes I say fuck you and other times im just like thanks... LOL its an inside joke.. Don't ask! But really people like judge me for what I look like and what they see about me... Then they put a label on me.. And I don't really fall under any certain label. And if I do then I don't know about it. I really don't like labels though because with labels they judge you for your appearance and how you act. But that's not what its all about. Its about like how you act, how you feel, how you dress, what you are interested in... Not just on one glance.. Yes I know I tend to do the whole label thing everynow and then but then I actually take the time to get to know the people. And when people put a label on me they don't take the time to get to know me. Its just standing there with a label, and so many un-noticed or un-seen feelings, thoughts, interest, but they over look it.   im getting to this because today I just found out how two guys really feel about me.. they said that they wouldn't go out with me because they don't think I can keep a long, real relationship. Ok well in my past experiences I haven't had luck but theres a reason, or two. Well first of all I realy never wanted to get hurt, and the one time that I let go and put my self out there, I fell in love with him, then things got all fucked up and I broke up with him. But see the thing is that you don't realize how much you love a person until they are gone. And at this point he was gone. Then I kept trying to keep my feelings bottled up and when I saw him again it just exploded. And he used me or what not.. like I was just a piece of ass and started making out with me.. then got on line like a week later and started calling me a slut, and said i need to clean up, not cuss, and get half decent friends. this ticked me off you know but hey people tend to do crazy things when they are in love, so i changed with the help of sara and i was classy! then after a week i realized he was an ass! he had been spreading rumors about me around his school (Broughton) and he was saying that im a slut, that he regrets ever goin out with me and that we had sex...AND WE DIDN'T! so i was just like you ass and have been like fucked up ever since... well i have been trying to open up a little but its hard.. see the thing about him was that i actually really liked him and he asked me out, when he did i was like glowing. he is one of the guys that i have really really really liked and opened up too or gave my heart to... and what did he do with it? broke it! so its recovering with some glue and tape and love from friends but its still hard to let my heart open up to another guy. but now that i actually finally found a guy i like as much as the one that broke my heart, i can't tell him how i feel.. he knows that i like him and stuff but he didn't say anything. i have liked him since the beginning of the year, and i still do.. i still have a glow when i see him, my heart jumps, and butterflies start flapping in my stomach... but he doesn't feel the same way about me... which bums me out... now that i found a guy i like really like, he won't take the time to get to know me, or he won't give me a chance to open up! he will say "hey caitlin was up" like all the time and we will have small talk.. but never a long conversation where i can open up or at least give him the chance to get to know me as well as giving my self the chance to know him better... but he won't give me the time of day.. but that doesn't mean i just gonna give up.. i can't stop likeing someone just like that..  my mind says no and i say no don't like him but my heart says YES you know you like him, hes so cool, funny, hot, and everything.. don't give up~!~   lets just say i listen to my heart~!~

      this is about december 11, 2003   Hey.. Wow my first time writing in my blog.. fun??? no clue.. just bored   today really sucked it couldn't have been worse. well i mean plus last night. because last night my dad called me ugly he was like u used to be pretty and now your not. it pissed me off so much!! i was like you bitch and busted out crying. i cried today like 1st and 2nd period.. i couldn't hold it back.. it totally sucked.. and then what he said just kept ringing in my head over and over... then i thought to my self... am i ugly? was i ever that pretty? well all i know is this, i may not be pretty on the out side but im Beautiful on the inside. you just have to give up time to get to know me. sometimes i think wow maybe i am pretty cause some people say that, then i don't believe them... and i think im soo ugly but i really shouldn't let it get to me.. because im pretty inside and thats all that counts right???  oh yeah and another thing i left out, my sister was at rchs today.. which was cool.. and i think i came to the conclusion that the guy i like doesn't like me... i mean i don't think he does.. he does't know i like him or anything i don't think but i dont know i like him alot and... well if he doesn't like me then im not gonna make him lol.. but rachael thinks he likes me and i hope so but justin says he doesn't or that he doesn't think he does! im so confused... should i tell him and take the risk of him laughing or smiling, or should i just hold in my feelings?  what do u think?
