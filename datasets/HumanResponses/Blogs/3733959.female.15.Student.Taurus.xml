      hello all, my friend just made a site on here and i thought it was a good idea...that and i am bored outta my mind. mmm sprite. anyways, does anybody realize the importance of friendship? i dont think many people do, putting friendships on the line for petty things like relationships, which usually turn out liek crap anyways. why does life suck right now?! it was so good until the last week of school! i need someone to explain to me why things happen and turning points in our lives. bad things like...liers and cheaters and attention seekers that just piss me off. anyways looking on the bright side, i can just lounge all day!! well...i could if i was allowed...which im not...ANYWAYS! not pointing any fingers or anything *points* DAMMIT! i did it again. o by the way dont tell but i own a man prude *wink*. wow....i really do ramble but i need somewhere to ramble like this and no one will look at it anyways cuz who knows about this site! i didnt until 5 minutes ago. im tired. im sleeping now. nights! mwaz... *bites innocent passerby* mwaahaha...

        It was SO much fun at Wasaga!! i had a blast. I really missed my friends Lauren and Amanda. We hung out a lot in school and i didnt see either of them for a while. Lauren was at the condo and Amanda and i just didnt make an effort to see each other. i made a bit of one but it didnt work for our schedules. So it felt really good that i could see my friends again and i dont think i realized just how MUCH i missed them until i saw them both again. Honestly(tw this movie called tank girl is one of the randomist, best movies i have ever seen....SEE IT!!). Anyways i get back from wasaga and now i cant get onto msn and its KILLING ME! i wanna talk to all the people who missed me while i was away for 5 days....well i hope people missed me lol. Niky? did u miss me? teehee...anyways yeah i was extremely bored so i decided to ramble out onto this blogger thing yet again. I think its going to become a bit of a habit for me now cuz it was the first thing i did on the computer besides checking email. Well, i would be chatting if i was aloud to download it onto this comp. mrah...anyways. Dont you love accessory shopping?? its something a woman can do and enjoy doing it because it has no real purpose...except to get crazy accessories that you can just show off tyo your friends. I went accessory shopping in wasaga cuz i had the money and wow it felt so damn good. i&nbsp; got a claddaugh (spellin) ring for only 10 bux!! its cheap for one of those things. I pointed the crown inwards cuz my heart doesnt belong to anyone. Meh. Anwyas im really just doing this for asolutely NO reason so im going to go do something else....something that doesnt involve much brain power cuz i am so dead right now. I can barely type. :D W00T!!! WASAGA!!!!

And it is awesome. im going up there to go to my friends condo which her family rented out! Its gonna be awesome. im going to go check out all the sexy guys who go to the beach and be all like....O.O W00T!! Anyways life sucks right now cuz I keep thinking about my boyfriend who is actually a man prude. I mean im kinda hurt about the way he has been after he asked me out. He never made any effort to be with me and its almost like he didn't think he had to make any effort cuz he just wanted a girlfriend. I don't want him to do things cuz he feel like he has to do them i want him to do stuff on his own but i dont think that will happen very soon. And i kinda miss him and it hurts knowing that he didnt wanna see me that badly cuz he didnt say o lets hangm out before i go away for a month. He hasnt even asked me for my number yet. I mean...i dont even know if he likes it this was or if he doesnt think i wanna go any further but i do...meh. anyways life sux but im so craving ice cream right now and there isnt any! i want ice cream... :( meh. anyways im going to stop boring you now, whoever is reading this besides niky lol. i luv u guys and i hope i feel better soon cuz its wierd that im all asad, im not really that used to it :P :) ttyl all

      ok so ive been going out with this guy for like...almost two months now and the most hes ever done to show me the least bit that hes interested is kiss me on the cheek after my friends got mad at him. That and he put his arm around me but only when the same friends yelled at him to do it. i didnt know that he was a man-prude when he asked me out! someone could have told me...anyways now hes in vancouver for a month and i really want to break up with him because this whole "relationship-with-a-guy-who-doesnt-even-know-my-number" is driving me absolutely mad. now i hafta do it on msn. *growls* its not fair that is hould hafta do it that way but honestly i have no choice because i cannot wait any longer. i hope he'll be ok after. anyways its canada day *woot* and im gonna see fireworks! then tomorrow im going to go to edgefest! GAH!! i luv edgefest and my friend called me up a couple days ago and said she had an extra ticket! i freaked out and then realized my parents wouldnt let me go. my friends mom helped us with a plan -i luv her mom- and called my mom saying that herslef and her husband would be going with us. My mom is now letting me go thinking we will be with two adults. isnt that kik ass?! anyways i must go...i am craving blood...*unsheathes fangs* haaaa!! *gets cloak* I LUV CLOAKS!! hem... until next time MWAHAHAHAHA!!! *smirk*

       i am so tired...yet again and extremely bored. i keep finding myself back at this site every once and a while to do a lil ramble. well today was a kinda fun but in a strange way day. i rode around on the subway for like...i dunno like 3 hours in total. it was fun cuz some of the best convorsations are on the subway. anyways omg this guy i met has the nicest hair and he actually has a great personality to go with it!! her never stops talking lol but it kills the silence. hes a writer and, as niky says, become an interior designer. hes helping me design my room :) cuz i cant :p anyways im meeting my friend sometime this week and she was telling me that some person smashed the front end of her car while it was in a parking lot! the person who hit it just left! well i wouldnt expect him/her to stay but shit that really sux. it really goes to show you that people are really starting to get dependent on electronics. i mean EVERYONE wouldnt have a job if it wasnt for some sort of electronic. the power outage (blackout) made everyone absolutely freak out. i couldnt even walk down the street without seeing every other person with groceries or propane. it was madness. i think the world should shut down for a few days and see what happens just for the hell of it. that would put people in their place haHA!! *insert eerie music here* MUAHAHAHAHA!!! hehe...*tear* i crack myself up whoo boy... ANYways. i must do something else now.  peace

       you know what sucks...my brain only works for like a couple hours a day in total. 15 minutes here 5 minutes here...no wonder im doing so horrible in school lol. last night i had to go to this bar-b-que and it totally sucked....if i hadnt of had a cooler i would have been mad at the world. and joy of all joys, the 12 yr old daughter is sleeping over next weekend. good thing shes bringing her gamecube or i would make plans. today was alright...i had a nap *gasp* which i never do. i pulled an all nighter last weekend and never got around to making up for the sleep. so i blasted celine dion and fell asleep for 3 hours. who knew that blasting celine would be sleepy music. it was actually kinda fun. im so screwed for my guitar lesson on tuesday. im going to be doing stuff tomorrow probably all day and ill only have like 2 hours to practise on tues and i havent practised yet. *sob* my teachers gonna be so disappointed in me. anyways im so fuckin tired...seems to be something i need to get used to seeing as though im always tired nowadays. that wont be so good for school when i stay up until the wee hours of the morning trying desperatly to finish geo or something....waitasecond...i wont have geo next year!! w00t!! this is reason to celebrate!! *gets orange juice* mmmm juice... school sux so much. im so happy u can talk all through class...well yur not allowed to but that has nothing to do with it. i just hope i dont get that same english teacher i had last year. she was BRUTAL! and she hated me. my crappy science teacher is gonna teach matrh this year but not science to the grd 10's so i better not get him either cuz he is suck a freakin push over...who assigns too much homework then never checks it. well maybe hes not so bad but hes an annoying git so it doesnt matter. anyways i have to go....so ill blog later :) or not...watever      peace
