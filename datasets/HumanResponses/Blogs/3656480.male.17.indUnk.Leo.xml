      so, the start of new week, here it is again, for the millionth time, i always love saturdays, the day at the end of the week where i get to see my beautiful girlfriend and then suddenly comes sunday where i have to wait 6 days til i see lauren again, its too much, i wish evryday was saturday so i could be with lauren 4eva, she is so nice!       anyways, next time saturday comes round me and lauren will have been 2getha for exactly 20 weeks which is so kewl, this is like the longest relationship i've had in 5 and half years, so i'm really happy with lauren, my one and only gurl foreva!       I landed a double kickflip the otha day, still waitin for jay to send me the camera evidence then i'll b sendin the proof to y'all of the net, that's for sure, most of you will b lik whoop di friggin doo but i thought it was the only decent trick i've eva done on camera       back at school 2moro and i have to find out an interesting newspaper article, oh how fun, any suggestions, there was an article handed out in class bout the destruction of a basket ball hoop in wyrley sayin its petty vandalism and evil, but we all know it was an accident , sum kid was just tryin to climb up there to have sum fun, no damage intended, total accident, i know people who witnessed this so all u freaks who keep blamin vandalism and evilness on the wonderful youth should take amin to think mayb sumtimes things r accidents and not meant , so stop throwin blame at us young uns!

      The matrix : kingo edition is back on track, many thanks to the characters kingo, broadie, smith, chris, dan, mike, mandy and myself as mad. The filming has undegone a 10900% increase in the amount o time per day filming and the july release date is still on track as kingo has also stated, let it be known that this film is not a 'ripoff' of the matrix but rather a remake, it is not copyright as it has a different story line, different characters, different scenes and is all acted out by 16-17 year olds, so enjoy my friends, enjoy!
