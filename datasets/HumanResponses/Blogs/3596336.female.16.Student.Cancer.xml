      oh.. why am i disappointed? ah.. nothing much la.. but i just feel she shouldn't do something like that.. why rush? it's not as if u really need IT that much right? u sure that "it" will last long? aren't u afraid of getting hurt agn?  this yr is already the O lvls lor.. aren't u afraid? But anyway.. it's your decision.. wish ya all da best... hope it goes well..  someone should know who i'm refering to... nvm... i dun wanna say much. sometimes i feel i meddle too much.. and shouldn't know as much either. Refrain from telling me, cos i'm disappointed with u..  P.S [ eh... insulting and mean?! when did i say anything mean to U??? basically, i'm being frank. kaoz.. it's not as if u dunno me... if i got something i will say.. so u gotta forgif me if i'm too straight-forward. BUT i think b4 i speak.. not stupidly. reason for my reaction ah... eh.. think i'm too concerned..but i wun come b/w u and HIM one la... as if i got nothing better to do like that.. but.. but.. i suggest dun tell me anything b/w u and him... cos i dun wanna go out of control.. later i give some stupid comments.. better not. So dun get angry. not that i dun wanna know.. but i know myself... so dun really tell me.. otherwise i'll try to pry it out from you.. LOl..]  wish u and him all da best lah... who wants to come b/w u must come thru me.. i'll make sure i'll HOOT the person.. LOL  LPY

      i remember waking up at 6.45am to go to school. my primary school is just opposite where i stay, so it's pretty convenient. the familiar surrounding make me feel comfortable. i still remember the dark alleys, the music room, the hall.. my classroom... the field, the teacher's room.. the general office, the basketball field, the canteen... the whole school! my batch was the last batch of students to leave the the school... before it merged with Clementi Town Primary. Soon... most of the original staff transferred, and most of the teachers of the new school is from Clementi Town Pri. i miss the school, the teachers, the fond memories the 19 yr old building brought to me.   When news of the merging surfaced, i was shocked but also relieved that i was the last batch.. so dun need to change the Uniform.(Clementi North Merged with Jin Shan Primary B4)(Jin Shan pri was originally situated at the Now Nan Hua Pri). It's just like killing a teenager. Clementi North was only 15 yrs old! How cld they close the school down?!  The school brought to me many fond memories... It also gave me opportunities to go overseas, tho i wasn't the elite students. i went overseas not once.. but TWICE! how lucky can i get? i remember after recess, my frens and i would head to the field and spend the rest of the break time there playing. we played croc, balancing act.. all the childish stuff. The guys would play soccer or basketball.. Oh! did i mention the canteen food!? Geez! it's very delicious! i miss it sooo much! We'll eat "gan mian" with loads of chilli & tomato ketchup.. Oh the drinks were very cheap too! u know how much? 20 cents only! and it's the size of those plastic cups u see in coffeeshops! Oh how i miss it...  I remember in primary 3, sitting with Zhimin and Grace, i sneaked food up to class to eat. it was the cuttlefish i remember really clearly.. hehe. That was sooo fun! Primary 5 was the best year i've ever had. i would play and laugh right in front of the teacher with my then-pals. But my results fluctuate. so p6 had to go to the 2nd class... wasted right? but nvm.. i'm having fun here in kent ridge..  haiz.. how i wish Methodist Girls' would allow alums to go back to the school to reminiscence.. how i wish.. i wish i wish.. i MISS U CLEMENTI NORTH!!!  *psst, i cut my hair by 3 inches! lol. Not that short. dun worry. kekeke.. wah.. my distest-tation for _ _ _ _ _ is getting deeper.. B****!    LPY

      if only i could turn back time: i would see how i look like when i was a little kid.. learn to appreciate my grandma more..  If only i can turn back time: i would wanna change all the mistakes that i made... erase all the unhappy things... if only i could turn back time: i would study harder & try to get into a better school... If only i could turn back time: i would believe i have the confidence to face ppl with my frizzy hair..  If only i could turn back time: I would persuade God to give me a better life.. not one filled with angst and sadness, and happiness and fun at the same time... If only i could turn back time: there's nothing more than i could wish for now...  wad's been down has been done... the emotional changes in me is visible.. the horrible experiences i have faced is still etched deeply in my heart. The sadness & joy some events brought to me still linger... I will nv forget some of my most unforgettable experiences.... which i have nv enjoyed in my entire life... due to my UDS.... and my lack of self-confidence...... when will i have the courage to stand up in front of ppl as a different person.. when will i have the chance to allow ppl to see the different me? When will i be given this chance to allow ppl to admire me instead of looking down on me? WHEN WILL THAT DAY COME?  LPY

O levels is approaching.. prelims is nearer. i cried.. cos i can't take it anymore. sooner or later i will go mad! oh God... why must u make Singapore so Darn small.. and that Singapore has to depend on her ppl for her survival and success thrive as a nation? WHY? WHY MUST I BE BORN IN SINGAPORE!? haiz.. so many pros and cons... say also cannot say finish la..      just read the newspapers today.... so far only one Law Diploma holder from Temasek Poly managed to get into the Law Faculty in NUS.. oh God...       Shit... can that elder sister of mine stop grumbling.. shut your F mouth up la..       I need to talk about THIS issue.. otherwise..i'll burst not saying..   Rhoda said he give me special treatment..I dun agree. haiz. it's difficult to talk nowadays... I know.. he lied to Wendy (aka SUPER DUPER BIG MOUTH + LOOSE TONGUE) that he doesn't like me anymore.. but... eh... he only recently told me he still like me. rhoda said he's doing to stop wendy from spouting nonsense.. that he knows what situation i am in. Oh man.. it's not becos of that lor. cos i told him not to admit it no matter wad. So that SDBM+LT tot that he doesn;t like me anymore and GO spread... wad.. all becos of your loose tongue?! Bullshit man u. oh.. and i wun ever ever be so bo liao to attempt to kick u out agn.. Cos u're one pain in the __s which just cannot go away. U sticky GLUE! wah... somemore u added more worries to me until i cried. Wendy, u just dunno how sensitive these issues are to me. i'm not like u.. ATTENTION seeKER! *pui!* u wanna be bitchy, be blunt.. i dun care. All i know is that NO one likes u, wendy.. DUN THINK TOO HIGHLY OF YOURSELF!      haiz.. i think i hurt him too deeply when i rejected him so strongly earlier this year. I'm sorry. But i just feel that i'm not good enuf for u... and there is this barrier b/w us... i'm sorry... I just seem so much like a disappointment. i hope u'll make me change my mind about u... but for the time being.. i just wanna be the best of frens with u.       I realised..... i'm part of the EXTRA grp of girls in my class... the other girls get together well.. i seem to not dissolve into their grp... oh well... classmates only.. i've got my best pals!

It's used only on special occasions like Councillors Investiture or when some students enter competitions and represent the school..
