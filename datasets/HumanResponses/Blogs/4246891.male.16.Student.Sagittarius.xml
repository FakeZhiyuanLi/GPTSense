        When I was born into this world, I was given the name Benedict. At first, I did not know what my name meant until I became knowledgeable enough to know what meaning my name bears. Basically, the name Benedict comes from the Latin word Benedictus, which means blessed. It was originally intended for my cousin, who was born earlier than I was. He was a premature baby, and was expected to die but he survived in the incubator. Since he was born in a hospital, which holds the name of St. Anthony, he was named after it. The name Benedict was just passed on to me, who was born 6 months later. So here I am, carrying the word blessed in my identity. As many people may have thought, you will expect that I would be a very religious child but not to that extent. Since I carry the word blessed in my name, I always make sure to be in a good relationship with the Lord; and I think this is the reason why I receive a lot of blessing from him. I think “blessed” is appropriate to me for the fact that God has always showered me with lots of wonderful things. This is why I am very thankful and grateful to him. To live out what my name means, I always make sure that God is the first in my life. I try to spread his words through being nice to my family, helping my classmates in their problems and singing with the choir during mass. As my music instructor told us, “He who sings well prays twice. Those who spread God’s words with the use of our talents like singing and who play an important role in the celebration of the mass are special to God and thus, more blessed (meaning receiving a lot of blessings).”

        From out of nowhere, I found myself walking in a dark forest. I realized that it was night time and that the full moon is brightly shining through the forest canopy. As I walk by the path where my feet involuntarily follow, I was amazed to find that I can brightly see everything in my path even if the place was really dark. I don’t know where I was. The only thing I knew is that there is something to be done and that it should be done, before I leave the forest. And so, I continued walking not knowing what lied ahead of me.  I heard a wolf howling, shivering my whole body until I had goose bumps. I stopped walking and realized that I was standing by a tree – a giant tree that looks a hundred years old. From within, I felt an invisible presence in the place. I sensed something mysterious about where I was but I don’t know. I really don’t know.  Then suddenly, to my astonishment, I heard a very soft voice creeping in my ear saying something that I could not understand. I started to feel nervous so I decided to walk away and sing my favorite jingle. As I walk to the place that even I don’t know, I looked back to where I was. I saw a man, all dressed in long white clothing and almost looked like me but I knew it was not myself, resting by a tree. The only thing I could not accept is that there is still someone behind him – another person I could not describe. His image was unclear to me. He looked as if he was a blurred picture standing behind the man. Then, I continued to the darkness ahead.  As I continued walking, I went deep into the forest. I felt pain in my feet, arms and legs as I walk to the path because the way was rough and thorny. I struggled and endured the journey to continue on to where I need to go even if it is uncertain. With the physical pain I was experiencing, I suddenly felt pain deep in my heart. I realized that it was hard to continue on. It seemed that I was regretting – regretting about the decision of moving on instead of staying under the tree and rest there forever but……. I must go on. I chose and all I have to do now is to make a stand.  I realized that I was already walking to a beautiful house. Yes, it looked like one of my dream houses and it stood in front of me – inside this forest. I could not believe it! I wanted to get in but as I saw the note on the front door, I started to think twice. The note says: “Those who dare enter this house will experience happiness for eternity – the peace and joy of solitude. But before he decide, it must be known that he will have to leave all that is behind including his memory – all that is there in his mind – everything!”  After a minute or two, I decided not to.  I declined to that opportunity of a lifetime. Why? It is because I wanted to cherish all the things that had happened to me, even the bad ones. I cherished them all. It really feels good to recall memories especially the changes that occurred in those years.  I will never forget all of them for without them, I could not get here – I could not see the future that lies beyond the path I have chosen – I could not be what I am now. And so, I continued…  After 20 years of stay in this forest, I am glad that it became very fruitful because with it, I found myself. It taught me to decide, to make a stand against all odds, to rebuild myself and to construct my foundation, to where my future stands. Even now that I am still wandering through this forest of uncertainty, I am pretty certain that my life will go on – and as I go through the life I chose, I will always carry the decisions I had made and the foundation of my future.

         I was horrified seeing myself standing in a dark room. Everything was black and the place was totally indescribable. From the side of my eye, I saw a tiny light glittering out of the dark blanket covering the room. Then, from that light grew a strange image that I could not understand. I saw a classmate doing something horrible and bloody. He was killing someone with a dart. And before I closed my eyes to avoid seeing the scene, I still saw him puncturing the helpless man on his right eye. Blood flooded the place leaving me in a shocked state.  Then again, everything became black and the place looked dark. Behind me, I heard a frightening sound but as I looked back, the only thing I saw was a wedding. I was puzzled seeing the couple hand copped as they were sitting in front of the altar. To my surprise, the couple looked straight at me. At that moment, I vividly saw their faces. Blood was falling down their heads and lacerations were all over their bodies. I could not imagine their wedding dresses ruined with blood. Vines were creeping around them as I see them floating away from me.  A television stood from the other side of the room. Zombies were all around the place and they were in a commotion. As I saw it, they were fighting about the television. It seemed that they were familiar to me. It looked as if they were my classmates! But I was not sure. I don’t know…  The place became dark again but another image became clear to me. Again, I saw the killer with a dart. This time, he was devouring on the man he killed. Then from behind, three of my best friends appeared in the scene. Altogether they said, “Come, eat with us. It’s our treat!”  I heard a clock ringing. Then, I remembered that I was late for school and that it was our school’s foundation day! As I stood from my bed, I felt a sudden rush of excitement from within but why?...........

        Well, I've got lots of things to do today... you know! college obligations. Medyo nagsasawa na nga akong pumasok eh! Anyway, gumawa ako ngayon ng project namin sa Theo, ung history ng name ko... Exciting nga eh pero di ko pa alam ang isusulat ko kya medyomagtatagal pa ako sa paggawa. The acquiantance last Saturday night was quite fun. Sayang! Di nanalo mga clasm8s ko sa Mr. and Ms. Bio pero nanalo naman ng Voter's Choice Award si JM. Ok na rin un... The party was not so good.  Hindi ko nasulit yung gabi. I could not imagine myself na bangag na akong umuwi ng Batangas dahil sa antok! It was 11 pm when we left Centro Bar at biruin nyo, dumating ako sa bahay ng 12:30 am. O, d b? Pero mabilis na rin yun. It takes 2 hours nga eh from Manila to Batangas. grabe, antuk na antok nga akong dumating. Nagbihis agad ako and then, humilata na agad ako sa kama. Sarap ng tulog ko! It was like 10 am when I woke up... Pagkakain ko ng tanghalian ay naghanda na agad ako kc kailangan ko nang pumunta ulit ng Manila. Ano ba yan! Wala lang... Hehehe! Cya nga pla, I'm so excited sa aming field trip sa  Corregidor . Imagine... First time ko sumakay ng barko! Ano kaya mangyayari. Kelangan kong umuwi this week! I'm gonna bring my camera and take a lot of pix... Hehehe! Masaya kaya! I'm sure it is... Naiinis ako ngayon kc hidi ako makag-upload ng picture. Ewan ko! (hindi ata talga pede!) Anyway, nkpglagay naman me ng background music. The HTML Class in my highschool really help a lot para lalo kong mapersonalized 'tong site na to! Gus2 ko sana ang song na The Reason ng Hoobastank pero hanap pa ko eh! Maybe next time... Going back to the acquintance party ng Bio Soc, nagustuhan ko ang music ng Silent Sanctuary. I like their idea of adding violin in their music. Astig nga eh! Naguatuhan ko talaga! Promise... Teka, napaphaba ata ahh... Siya nga pla, this week na ang Final Judgement ng CSGC. grabe, problema ko pa rin ang The Prayer. Naiinis nga ako eh kc marami nang parts ng mga kanta namin ang nakalimutan ko. Napakamakalilimutin ko talaga. Dementia na ba 'to? Hay naku! Tama na nga. Sa susunod na ulit... Ok, bye!

My father agreed to fetch me and I decided to go home on friday since we won't have any practice in the Glee Club on Saturday... I'm excited to go home 'coz I've got lots of things to get and do! Perhaps, I could start my shadring about my untold stories after I finished the essay Apple is asking me to make! I hope she would like it and it could make her win for the essay writing contest she would like to join in... Well, nothing more to write. I've still got to make a testimonial for my friends in friendster. Hey! Add me or could you please make me a testimonial? hehehe! ThanKs! Bye! I still have a class today at 1 pm - Theology Class!
