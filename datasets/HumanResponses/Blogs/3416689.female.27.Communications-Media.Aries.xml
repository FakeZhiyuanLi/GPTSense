      I guess this should be some kind of wonderful, intelligent, hysterical post. It's not. That's waaaaay too much pressure. Instead I will recommend the last movie I saw, 13 going on 30. I thought it was excellent. I love both Jennifer Garner AND Mark Ruffalo so I knew I wouldn't be disappointed.  While watching the previews I realized I'd seen most before. Probably because I saw Mean Girls 2 weeks ago. Thought that was excellent as well. Such a sad state of affairs is my life. Not sad enough to see White Chicks  (??) but still kind of pathetic. I'm just happy I beat my 10 year old sister-in-law to see it. Cause we have the same taste and I hate when she rubs stuff in my face.    I've been under a bit of stress this week due to my husbands pending immigration. After 3 years of marriage to a lovely Canadian I met in college the INS is finally interested in finding out if we are a sham. Of course we're not but they can make alot of trouble. I can't imagine people going through all this without a legitimate marriage, the money would not be worth it.  My husband has no idea what color my toothbrush is. We are totally screwed.  Im off to watch the last 2 episodes of showbiz moms and dads on the tivo. This will get better I promise...

      Work is crazy. Im really out of place at my office to begin with and when the pressure is on I just think more and more about what the hell Im doing there. The people I work with must be pretty stupid if I'm getting all sorts of recognition for the job i'm doing in the half ass way I do things. Im not any kind of overachiever, i hate being the best at things. I like to do a decent job, lay low, under the radar. I am a great B-type student without studying, and that really stays with you. I observe, keep my mouth shut most of the time and do what people ask.&nbsp; Apparently that is hard to come by in the Corporate Events world.&nbsp; When other people slack off, basically do not do their work and I have to pick up the pieces it pisses me off. Why do they get paid $500 a day for what they do when I have to carry them along. I am somewhat of a mid-lower level employee. A few years of experience out of college, in THEATRE of all things. How am I qualified to run these projects. I do not want responsibility. I want the people above me to do their job so I don't have to be stressed out all the time. I hate working. I wish I was unemployed.

      I booked some plane tix today for the wedding in Florida over thanksgiving. I have to say i'm pretty psyched, just knowing how I will be feeling in November. Totally ready for a sunny vacation.&nbsp;  &nbsp; If you want something to be angry, confused, annoyed about read Under the Banner of Heaven by Jon Krakauer. I cannot handle religious fanatics.  &nbsp; Da Ali G show is on HBO all night tonight. I feel like they never show these reruns so I'm pretty psyched to TiVO it and watch throughout the weekend.  &nbsp; &nbsp;

      See thats my problem. I commit to something then totally forget about it. What a lazy ass am I.  But really now, I have been quite busy lately and too pooped to put any thoughts down.  In the past month Ive been to Puerto Rico (wedding #1), Western Mass (Squeeze got some work) and Montreal (Squeeze's sisters 30th bday) tomorrow we are heading to Chicago for wedding numero 2 this summer. And its barely July. I think I am just bitter because I didnt make anyone come to my wedding. We got married 3 years ago in Vegas. 30 people showed up on their own accord. I didn't even make people plan a bridal shower, i just hate that shit. The puerto rican wedding (somewhat misleading since they are both Jewish) was the first wedding of a friend I have ever attended. This year I have 9 weddings. NINE. 1 im a matron of honor, 1 a bridesmaid and another my husband is a groomsman. We did not have a wedding party. I did not make anyone wear a seafoam green dress.BIT-TER.  I'm going to try to be positive in blogging. i am not a very positive person.  Have a great day!!
