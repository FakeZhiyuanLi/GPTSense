Today my sis didn't go to work. when reached home, still tired, felt like so boring and blur. After that, sleep a while. suddenly i cry, don't know why?! Just felt like....don't know how to express my feeling here. My head felt so heavy, cannot think other things, just can think the unhappy things. Later, i take my hp and saw the pic msg send by my friend, OK a bit lor.   My sis... she go out again, really don't know what happen to her, ask her what happen, she don't want to told. just said my problems let me solve myself. This few day, she always go out, this time my mum very angry and throw her clothes outside the house and said don't want her this daughter, want 'putus hubungan' with her. I really really don't understand.... If my 'sei jie' and brother at home, thats really better than now. Then, i no need scared anymore, may be will more happy than now. My parents also no need to angry, and my fifth sis no need go out like this. May be i think too much la....small girl ma....sure got a lot of things to think and problems de.  Don't know when i will really really grow up. 'Ru Guo Wo Shi Nan Sheng Jiu Hao Le' Aiya...'fan' ar, next month working liao, how to take the resit form leh?!! Who can help me??

At the first, i should not choose to study at TAR college de but at that time, don't know why i 'jian chi' want study TAR college. may be influence by my brother kua.

       Today super free, no work to do! Don't know why today was so different with other day. My head of payroll department was take leave about 1 week already and today IT department had 1 colleague get sick didn't come to work. Payroll department had 5 people including me, 4 of them were so talkative and clever except me. 1 of them was younger than me, also same as me was a new people there. She was so clever and so so talkative people, know how to make people happy all the time. but me leh, very useless and stupid. I felt so shame and scared to face them. Don't want face also want to face de la...'run away' from them also no use. Everyday go to work also can see them de...how can don't want to face?!! I always think myself, may be i'm not suitable to being human, that means  'NG SHI ZHOU YAN' ! I don't know how to made other people happy all the time but opposite i just can bring trouble to other people. Scared this scared that, somemore i don't know how to made a good communicate with other people! People asked me one, then i answer one, nothing to talk with them after that. I really don't know what to talk to them. Now i also didn't have confidence that i can doing this job stable or not?!!!

       Yesterday very busy until me always forgot to call back college to asked when the resit student bill can take, already 3 days i forgot. Everytime i said want to call, after that i forgot to do it. Until i finish working, then i remember it but already at night. The college office already close. How could i forgot the so important things de?!! May be i'm too busy this few day, my mind just think about my work and left the resit bill behind. I asked my sister to call back college today, she don't want to help me, she said:  your things just do it yourself, busy until forgot was not the reason, only alasan to let u 'yi lai' other people to do.  When i consider back, may be she is right. I'm not suppose to 'yi lai' other people do the things for me, if one day no people at your side, then who will help you do your things?! If scared to forget can use reminder to remind or write down what u want to do next. Then u wont forget anymore! Today so free, nothing to do. When after closing day, sure won't have work to do one coz the ironing department haven't send their ticket to me. so no work to do. Ai...sian!! They always send their ticket so late until me want to do my work so rush. I'm very hate of that, complaint also no use. They always like that.

He had girlfriend already lor but he told me that they already broke when i phone him that day. Long time didn't talk with him lor sure got a lot of things to talk de but i wrong, we are not much topic to talk de. Looks like very strange already... he also asked me don't forget him wor..."i won't forget you de, don't worry lar. Only you forget me." I knew i'm not a good friend, so i also didn't hope all people that i knew before still remember me. No people remember me, never mind...at least i remember you all!!!  Already one month working lor, time past so fast. Now already in month June lor, want to start doing revision, prepare for exam. If not, will fail the exam lor. I cannot still fail de lar, if fail, didn't have chance to resit anymore. so i must appreciate this chance to get pass.  'GAM BA TEH'  I know i can do it de.....hehe....

       Today i found something very funny in my department, so want to share with you all.    College Life   Malaysia semua babi, Our goverment is so lousy, Make the college become no quality, Chinese and Indian pun tak boleh masuk University, They never gave a choice for me, Because no money cannot study overseas, So I always feel so pity,  Every college is greedy, Sini sana all need money, When pocket kosong our perut noisy, I am poor because they suck my money,  Exam questions full of difficulty, It has one reason only, Which is to earn more money, Because we retake money masuk lagi,  The staffs always so aksi, They did wrong never say sorry, Before asking please show your money, Otherwise they won't be happy, We pay their salary still make us angry, That's why i wanna study hard to earn more and more money  Tiap-tiap hari feel so lazy, Never try to wake up early, Always hope college sekarang cuti, Everyday go class feel sleepy, Lecturer always scold me lazy, Do assignment just like to copy, Before the finals just feel worry, Every night study until crazy, Because scared got scolded by mummy.  Why my class always none pretty, Those elephants always show me how she's sexy, The monsters wanna treat me nicely, Like that i better mati.  My looks are***ugly, Saya mari girl girl lari, Everyday date them they sure say busy, Semua orang tak ada hati, Make me always so lonely, Only can watch porno movie.  CS always let people bully, Maybe I am really so lousy, Although knife people is so happy, But I am always unlucky, Kena headshot easily, After mati still mati.  End  How ar? Funny or not?? hehee....

       Arsene Wenger : Don't cry for me arsenal....  I think this four day not is gunner's day, first is MU beat they with 1-0 in FA semi final , then following is Chelsea beat they with 2-1 in Champions League quarter-finals! Chelsea finally broke their 17-match Arsenal hoodoo with a 2-1 win at Highbury to reach the Champions League semi-finals, 3-2 on aggregate. From a possible treble to at most a single in just four days, Arsenal's cloak of invincibility has been cut down to size with astonishing speed. So let us 'pray' for gunner,  DON'T  cheer up so fast! hehe...keep on like this, let they lose EPL also since they only lead 4 point in the top! Red Devil(MU) maybe lose ability to win the title since they was 12 point behind Gunner(Arsenal), but The Blues(Chelsea) still have this potential! The Blues..still have 7 match in hand..cheer on...let those gunner know 30 match unbeated in EPL no mean will win the title...if not enough quality player play those match...don't learn Red Devil talk about Treble and purposely keep on unbeated! In past, ONLY Red Devil have this ability only...since they won Treble in 1999!Glory Glory MU!

The 23-year-old England forward completed his medical this afternoon and has signed a five-year contract with the Old Trafford outfit.

       United in command  Manchester United look certain to qualify for the Champions League  urlLink following a 2-1 win over Dinamo Bucuresti  in Romania. The hosts started well and took the lead when Quinton Fortune inadvertently put the ball into this own net, but after Ryan Giggs levelled in the 38th minute there was only going to be one winner. United claimed the advantage with an own goal of their own, as Angelo Alistar turned debutant Liam Miller's driven cross into his own net on 72 minutes. Last night astro didn't have live this match, make my heart so itchy. Although Manchester United have some many player injury and can't play for this match, but i believe Manchester United still have enought quality player bring back to Old Trafford with a 2-1 victory.

       Community Shield New Season of England primier league 2004/2005 is back, last night Arsenal drew first blood in this season's battle with arch-rivals Man United with a 3-1 victory in the Community Shield. Gilberto sprung the offside trap to open the scoring early in the second-half but United struck back through Alan Smith, who volleyed home on his official debut. Arsenal played the better football in a competitive friendly but it was two pieces of indecisive defending from United which gifted Jose Reyes with a 59th minute goal and resulted in a Mikael Silvestre own goal minutes later. So sad, last night can't sleep well one of the reason due to this match, but nvm lah! in EPL history, which team won Community Shield in beginning of the season, they will lose in the title, hope this season also like this...
