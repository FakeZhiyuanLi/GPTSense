                        It rained this morning.i love the rain.             Had drama practice today...which was awesome. tomorrow's the competition.Fingers crossed other classes will   suck  . haha. i really think we've got a good chance.Lets just hope no one screws up anything.I play the stupid school bitch. there's 3 of us in case ur wondering,syazna,arifah and myself. Akoy said "memang patutpun". which really made me think,   am i a school bitch  ? haha. I'm the  dumb  bitch, arifah is the   mengada   bitch and syazna is the   mean   bitch. we have a special walk and trademark and everything.which is sooo hillarious. it's like a scene from some crappy low cost american movie! haha.          there's this one part in the drama wer i hav to fall down... and since we've been practicing a lot lately, i've got bruises on my knees which   BLOODY HURTS  !!                 honestly, if i dont bitch abt someone there's really nothing to say. haha                  *dont try to tell me what to say*                               jaja

              well...well...well....isnt this awesome? i've become an  overnight celebrity , and all thanks to a fat mouthed bitch.. (haha... i am sooo  tempted  to say more abt her but nope, its okay...i still DO have my moral values like = loyalty.. but obviously she does not hav it). suddenly everyone wants to know the blog's add, what i said abt you know who and how she reacted to it. yes, by now i am very sure she has been here.. welll well well, someone even saw her opening my page in class.. ;) publicity does wonders (*hint*)  am i mad at her cause she's calling me a bitch behind my back because of the previous entry? nope, in fact im   thrilled  ...at least she knows the truth, i know i for one would not want to live my life knowing my "friends" were terrible. i am trying to fix something here am i not? :)  here's a list of what she said about me behind my back. resources remain anonymous... :)   1. that i do not deserve to be a H.O.D in the prefectorial board      2. that i want to do everything in the drama (helloo, am i or am i not the director? i give   instructions, you follow. dumbass)

            Since i did   promise   earlier.... and yes, since syazna did ask ever so nicely for her description im gonna go ahead and insult and/or compliment the whole 8 of us thing. :P. dont get me wrong, i am of course honoured to be in the   "clique"   as tressa calls it , but at the same time i cant help but feel the whole "im in this group and ur in this group" system is messed up.It would be much fun-ner if we all could just stay the way we are instead of dividing into groups based on personality/wealth/looks/style. whatever.
