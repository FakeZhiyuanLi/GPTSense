      haa... another fast paced day...  I know what u all think of advertising..the super glamourous profession, where u get to brush shoulders with the top models of the country and smoke and dream about nike, harley davidson and the likes, and work with rajiv menon for shoots...  hold on folks..lemme tell u abt some miserable facts of life..coming frm the sheer bliss of working in an (m)ad agency...  The average life of an above average ad professional (heehee thats me!) is spent thus:  1. Coordinate meetings between boss, big boss,, creative and creative big boss. Not to mention the fact that all of them hate you because u r the only living (?!) witness to the agony they have to go thru with their respective bosses...  2. Talk to studio to make the third logo in the top left corner of the poster 800% bigger .Am sure 'brilliant creative' to a client means just the branding & logo in an unimaginably huge (read ugly) amount of space..!  3. Run back to studio, because client stuck between his boss and sales people realises the logo has to be (aw.. u guessed it..) bigger.  4. Run and beg to copy writer to sign off his ad ("huh--wwhere is the ad i just see the damned ugly logo of ur ch****ya client..!")  5. make presentations on arbit topics such as 'reason for rainfall drop in timbuktu and if it concerns share drop for our brand in faridabad'(which will never be shown to client, for fear of appearing smart) . If u r lucky & get to work on  p(b)itches,  u can  make presentations on 'what our agency lives, breathes and excretes for (how lovely..!)  6. Master the art of acting as if u have a split personality especially when u get calls from suppliers for money ("I understand ur situation, but I dont know why she isnt at her desk will definitely tell her"). Some brave souls go to the extent of ducking whenever a phone goes ringing in any corner of the office.  7. Feeling guilty about 'not loving advertising', & attempting to write a ppt all urself on 'semiotics of advertising itch creams' . which will never be understood and hence be dismissed.  8. Learn the art of writing minutes, where a perfectly innocent 'ahmm...the boards are ahmmm...' by the client needs to be interpreted as 'Client loved the boards presented by the agency and jumped out of his chair & offered to kiss the whole team'or the likes...   Coming back to the topic - 'glamourous' ?? my foot..!  want proof? ever experienced having to go all scarlet and feel inadequate when trying to answer a seemingly simple question such as 'so what do u do at work?' the following will be the drift my conversations in this count: ( a sentiment I bet wud be shared by co-ad ppl)  nattu mama (strictly fictionary character, who appears 'vonly' in tam weddings): so u work in advertising what do u do?  self: oh iam in client servicing..  nattu mama  (taking in his sniff powder for the nth time)-  o-ho..so what do u do - make the films?  self: no mama, that is made by production house  nattu mama ( suspisciously) - so u write the script for it?  me: no mama, that is done by creatives...  mama: (slightly exasperated, and giving a wait-till-i-expose-her look to the junta that has gathered ard): so what do u do? the strategy...?  me: (giving him a you-nose-poking-moron look): no mama thats done by the clients...  Nattu mama: (with a wicked smile appearing in lips..): so u dont do anything at all & still earn money??!! ho-ho-ho ( laughter shared by Junta)ennavo po, nalla vazhila sambathicha pothum (whatever it is, hope u r earning in the straight way..!)  The rest of the family suddenly starts looking at you with the suspiscious glare reserved for siren look alikes (not that they ever had any hopes on u in that front!)...  oh damn..there I lose another opportunity of ever finding a nice tam-bram boy..for nattu mama will single handedly ensure loss of 50% of my TG, thanks to his sniff powder connections with every tam-bram eligible bachelor's dad!  Ever wonder why single southie men never find babes? now u know..!  And to think that all this is inspite of working for an agonizing 28 hours a day! glamour world - wither art thou?!

      just cudnt resist having my own blog..i mean well finally an unidentifiable corner in the cyberspace for writing ur own cribs..heck! life cant get better!  This is like being given an empty diary u know...I guess I will do the same as we do with fresh new diaries..Writing for da first 4 days with all enthu, and enthu receding frm 1800 words an hour to .18 on an average for the rest of the year...  Have decided whats gonna be my writing style...'bridget jones'...!  I mean one year into work life ( post college life, ad-school life etc etc), and no boy friend at sight + a growing 'prosperity' curve (read - paunch) I have started pursuing this great ambition to be the indian bridget jones... wat say folks?  in case any one who browses by bothers to read this...hey am ash, in my early 20s ( doesnt that sound young) working in advertising ( yup the global camp where all babes congregate - what an irony..!), and generally 'spaced out' - as kind souls put it...  for the dose of history..am a proper tam bram iyer ponnu frm chennai, who is one of the rare few who escaped frm the great software engineer blackhole, which generally leaves all women with an 'Iam-an -nri-so-i-dont-care-if-i-dont-have-an-identity' attitude ( no offence sweethearts..!)  oh yeah the most important thing abt me..shd tell ya all what I am famous for - my hindi...  check this one - "duschasan is the duryodana's brother who tried 'pallu latke' with draupadi rite?"  "bhaiya do anda mere namm me daal ne ka.." - nothing gross guys just means to put two omlettes i got in my account...  needless to say, wherever I go ppl ard me stay happy...  will be back for more...!

      Had stopped writing in my blog, coz i am a religious follower of  urlLink sidin's  blog and I realised, I pale in comparision in terms of sheer mouse clicks - his = 31523 a day vs mine = 5 a day, "author generated" clicks. I even tried to increase my profile views by re-re-revisiting it myself - only to realise that it doesnt increase the count (why?!)....  Anyways the ernest urge to write (also referred as boredom) got the best of me, and here I am blogging away...  Talking abt sidin, am sure by now every uncle, aunty, patti, paiyan etc of the web community have now read his famous post of 'travails of single southie men'....I have read re read laughed, ducked and laughed rolled and laughed etc etc with this post. But the single point it tries to make is the point I am trying to discuss in this post (er..did that sound intellectual?!)  The cribs of why southie men are single is fine, but more than the curd rice, name, clothes, etc etc, there is one single truth why they dont get babes - Their genetic make up prevents them from having any kind of interaction with women. This, I beleive is the beginning point of all their woes  I mean a nagasubramanian, - since he has been 8 yrs old, has found comfort with his fellow 'machan' crowd rather than women.His interaction with other gender would be as under, in his life cycle -  5 yr old - A historical age - this will be the only time of his life when nagu actually played with girls - ringa ringa roses etc etc.,  8 yr old - Nagu has started thinking that 'girls' are not cool and finds solace with mani, swaminathan and likes;starts playing 'cricket' & 'Football' in playground - maniammais NOT allowed. Somewhere, the 'kapil dev's sooper sixer' talk excludes women.  12 year old - Nagu has reached the stage of  progressive women hating . Girls to them are these unwanted pests roaming ard with oiled hair and 'always first rank's. Also because of the constant diet of the 'Aan singam' (Lion) talks that his granny keeps giving him...  14 yr old - uh-oh..some biological changes have started taking place and Nagu has an ernest wish to talk to girls - but then u c- it wont be looked too nicely by swami & co ( inspite of their own wishes to do so)...Our poor nagu becomes a recluse by choice, and immerses himself in books as well as bad word mouthing , rare &amp; feared cigeratte smoking etc etc with his fellow 'machaan' crowd.  As Nagu leaves school - this is a nice sensitive age. A time when Nagu sincerely feels bad for calling uma 'Kuppamma', pulling akila's ribbons etc etc...too late! All the talk that happens is the bye's on farewell day.  16-21 - Our studious Nagu boy, has earned admission in an IIT/ REC/ BITS and the like All brilliant engineering college, where precisely 2.34% of the Junta is women, and who inevitably are only seen in the classroom and are spending rest of the time studying. So by default Nagu is left with men to enjoy the 'pleasures (?!)' of youth...  21 + - Now comes the moment of truth in Nagu's life...this is when he starts working and goes to B-schools, and er- basically starts meeting the 'bobby desai's and 'Rahul Gupta's of the world - who with their suave 'pour-your-heart-out-to-me-baby' attitude are scoring by dozens with the babes around. He tries to open his mouth and get talking - But oh - damn! All that comes out is 'can you lend me module 3 of OMD paper' / 'can you tell me how to crack 5863 in Java'  This pushes them to try two tone Magenta shirts, learning the macarena etc etc...or in other words, 'despo steps to woo the woman crowd'  Just contrast this with the lifestyles of  Rahul Gupta's , who have always had 'baby's and 'chintu's as friend, and who have always seen girls as 'Just another buddy' types ( I-am excluding the dangerously nerdy types here )  The biggest backfiring all this have is our poor nagu has lost out completely on having girls as just 'friends' - he just doesnt beleive in the platonioc possibilities of friendship - a dangerous situation !  So my dear friends, dont blame it on ur lovely names - seetharaman, swaminathan, subramanian, sundarraman etc etc - u still have hopes if u just warm up to the idea that women are not necessarily alien...

      I dont believe this oh damn lord..I am actually sitting at office on a Friday evening when the lovely weekend is waiting for me...sheet what a loss of party time...! groan.......  well well..how i wish i cud say all that..in my case it works the other way ard 'oh-my-gawd..what am i doing in a party..?!  Coming from a proper Chennai 'goodie goodie' studious (ah-well-ok..) background,parties (the drinking, dancing variety) in my mind was things which happened only in page 3, society magazines, and movies... and well I was in for some surprise...  All this was till I joined this comm school famous for drug addicts, co-ed hostels and ad- professionals in that order. needless to say partying was the mantra. The reasons vary frm the mundane 'assignment got cancelled' to serious stuff like 'peggy (the campus dog) has had a successful sterilizing operation done'It took me a while but I realised that all that men and women congregating and doing wild shaking of heads, bellies and other things in unison is what 'real' partying is...  I distinctly remember the first major 'party' I attended. Here i shd mention that I have this unsatiable curiosity to learn things. (are u sure they are smooching i wanna look closely.. only to be stopped by a "bug off aishwarya, cant u see we r busy?")  U bet I had a fun time peeking in and out and wandering amidst wine glasses, spaghetti tops and smooching couple. In wild excitement i started dancing too...my embarassed frd and came and bit my ears saying "aishu, u dont dance tamilian stuff  for 'we didnt start the fire' - oh damn!  too late! by then the whole drunken, semi drunken and sloshed crowd was too carried away by what they had witnessed and demanded an encore. I blushingly enjoyed my moment of glory and obliged, only to be rechristened 'maami' the next day. a lurvly name which stayed on for the rest of the time in campus.  Soon by the 48th party in our second month, I mastered the art of acting u r drunk when u havent had a sip of even plain thums up, always dancing like ur legs are wobbly, dressing up with horrendous shades of lipstick (they look good with the lighting - colour papers stuck to the study lamps provided by the insti) etc etc... All this till I realised that no matter what I shall stay a maami.  Completely given up, over time I become so good at partying that all the cue i needed was the huge speakers kept right outside my room.I  got into the groove and escaped to the 24 hours library...It helped during placements u know?!   Flash front (heh heh) - Circa 2004, office - "aishu, I have these great passes for the 58th channel launch of zyx group (Highest TRP acheived - .3), do u wanna come?  zoom out and zoom in - next CEO of globule molecules ( or whatever) partying? no way..  "I have work u know?"  so there I am, sitting in office and blogging away crap, when the rest of the wrld is busy ogling at the handsome dudes and pretty dudettes and err..dancing with them...  hail parties!

      I just loved this weekend. It was raining discounts at every big brand store in bombay ( apart from the normal rain, ofcourse!) the shopping freak in me took over and i was happily hopping across the stores...  Talking about the other rain, I always wonder, how do materialists - metereologists or whoever, measure rain...I feel a communist sense of discomfiture to imagine that there will be a a bechara employed in every meterological office whose job description is a single line ' hold a test tube to one strand (?!) of rain and keep measuring it'....all to come up with a silly measurement of it rained 223.4 mm in Jumri thalaiya today..a detail noone but meteorlologists (damn the spelling) are only bothered abt...worse, I shudder to think of the plight of the same guy in the Chennai office, who is in the danger of losing his job considering it rains an average of .0038 millimetre every monsoon over there! ( big boss - "I think u arent holding the test tube properly - we need to show better figures/ amma will chase us out of our jobs")  Back to my shopping, it was amazing to see how mad mumbai ppl can get in monsoon. there were precisely 1340 shoppers (several cute guys at that ...) in the 1200 sq. ft store in a lazy saturday afternoon...  One thing that never ceases to upset me after every shopping spree is how I end up buying the same shade of 'dull mauve' (as my friends encouragingly call it) and worse the same sniff powder colour with stripes shirt. It has something to do with the shop lighting u know - every colour looks brright and pleads 'pick-me-up'..but to think of it, my affliction with sniff powder - i think- began post growing up watching nattu mama sniffing away to glory and making that loud between a belch and a sneeze kinda noise...my brother and me have often tried imitating it, but only ended up in tears...  The shopping was the only nice part of the weekend ...what happened later was quite a nightmare (literally). I was dreaming as below: So I met this handsome smart  suave  tambram boy (WHAT an oxymoron!) who had done an MBA from Harvard and is working with he-man brothers. It didnt take us much time to start seeing each other , and one day he just asked me to close my eyes and he took my hands and............ ouuuuuuuuuucccccccccccchhhhhhhhhhh - what a bite...... screammmm I got up and there was this squeaky dirty thing looking at me with a challenging gleam...its teeth was hanging on to something - oh wait that was my hand!!!!!! A rat had bitten me! lemme put it this way a RAT bit ME..!  I dont want to get into any gory details here..It would suffice to say that spent my sunday trying to call doctors and went through the agony of nurses laughing behind my back (to put it subtly)  Now my living moments are spent in the constant fear that am gonna become a rat woman - eeks - my teeth has started protruding as well ...!  will blog again if iam not crawling across the dirty towns fighting with dr.bad cat or the likes.
