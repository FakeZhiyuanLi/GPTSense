        I finally got my domain name up woot woot. At   urlLink  www.otherkinwolves.com   . Go me ::does dance:: To start off my lovely Wednesday, okay well it was my brothers birthday he's seven today HAPPY BIRTHDAY JOHNNIE. I went to school and due to the junior class testing our periods were all messed up, so we had eight, seven, six, one, five, four, three, two. And during French i was on the computer and&nbsp;I got bored and sick of playing this game. Go to quia.com if ya wanna play with it, it stupid. But anyways I went and tried getting on AOL and the God damned school has it blocked. What the feck do they block people from sighing onto aim and AOL for. So I made an online journal woot woot. How fun is that!? But the weird thing is is that I already have a journal, as a matter of fact, in writing in it. What's the sense in that? Oh and here comes the White Flag song by Dido. ::hums:: aight over n out. OY!

Go me!!   urlLink  www.otherkinwolves.com    . I also went to this cheesy site where this guy claims he's a graphic artist. But he uses psp7 and the graphics he charges big name companies for he makes in approximately 5 minutes. (10) if he's slow. I think I shall do that. >evil laugh<>grins<>

        Long time to talk huh? Well, lemme think what new crap has been goin on... Well, we changed classes about a month ago now instead of research writing&nbsp;I have computers which is practically the WORST class ever. Stef has been on a "depressive" streak, and me. I have been me, blah. I started an online group called the Otherkin Wolves and have pretty much left the Rape Survivors chats. Thought once I left SIRS everything would be clear no more drama. Happy little peaceful wolf chat. um no. Its a few more days until spring, and my brothers birthday he is going to be six. I have no clue what to get him, prolly get him some Yu-Gi-Oh cards or something kids like that don't they? I have been trying to get in contact with my friends Missy and Rach but can't get through. THE ONION SNOW! LMAO My dad has a think with the last snow fall of the season, he calls it the Onion Snow. He has to say it like 6 different snow falls before we finally get to the "onion snow" we've already hit lucky number two this year, lets go for a record! Oh yea I have a new boyfriend, Jordan. He skipped school and got himself in trouble now he isn't allowed online ::pulls hair out:: ahhhhhhhhhh. ::takes deep breaths:: I'm okay. Ohh and almost forgot WE GOT A NEW WALMART SUPER CENTER. WOOT WOOT. Well,&nbsp;I think I've bout talked myself out for tonight. Till next time....

        Well, today was q quite interesting day. Quite interesting indeed. I cut myself on glass in art class. Heh rhymes :P But yea I snapped it and the corner sliced my thumb and I walk over to Jessica and I'm like "I cut my finger" and she looks at it and grabs it and blood starts dripping down her arm and she goes ballistic and starts screaming and crap. So I walk over to the sink and start washing my hand off. And Mrs. Smith grabs my arm and is opening the cut and making it bleed worse. And is like "Your going to need stitches" and sends me down the nurse. And the nurse calls my mom and my mom miss interpreted it and thought she said I cut my finger off. ::shakes head:: So I went tooth doctor and then I went to my grams and had shrimp chow main. Then I call Stef ands he tells me how Jess and Jonelle are telling everyone that I cut my finger off. We shall see what surpassing gossip that has been spread tomorrow. woohooo!

        Walked away, heard them say"Poison hearts will never change, walk away again" Turned away in disgrace Felt the chill upon my face cooling from within It's hard to notice gleaming from the sky When you're staring at the cracks It's hard to notice what is passing by with eyes lowered You... walked away, heard them say "Poisoned hearts will never change, walk away again" All the cracks will lead right to me And all the cracks will crawl right through me All the cracks, they lead right to me And all the cracks will crawl right through me, and I fell apart As I... walked away, heard them say "Poisoned hearts will never change" Walked away again Turned away in disgrace Felt the chill upon my face cooling from within Don't waste your touch, you won't feel anything Or were you sent to save me? I've thought too much, you won't find anything... Worthy of redeeming Yo he esta-do agui muchas veces antes y regreso To break down, and cease all feeling Burn now, what once was breathing Reach out, and you may take my heart away Imperfect cry, and scream in ecstasy So what befalls the flawless? Look what I've built, it shines so beautifully Now watch as it destroys me Y regreso agui otra vez y comienzo To break down, and cease all feeling Burn now, what once was breathing Reach out, and you may take my heart away Break down, and cease all feeling Burn now, what once was breathing Reach out, and you may take my heart away I left it all behind, and never said goodbye I left it all behind, and never said goodbye I left it all behind, and never said goodbye I left it all to die I saw its birth, I watched it grow I felt it change me I took the life, I ate it slow Now it consumes me I break down, and cease all feeling Burn now, what once was breathing Reach out, and you may take my heart away Break down, and cease all feeling Burn now, what once was breathing Reach out, and you may take my heart away &nbsp;Heart away I... I came here by day, but I left here in darkness And found you, found you on the way And now, it is silver and silent, it is silver and cold You, in somber resplendence, I hold Your sins into me Oh, my beautiful one Your sins into me As a rapturous voice escapes, I will tremble a prayer And I'll beg for forgiveness (Your sins into me) Your sins into me Oh, my beautiful one Light, like the flutter of wings, feel your hollow voice rushing into me As you're longing to sing So I... I will paint you in silver, I will wrap you in cold I will lift up your voice as I sink Your sins into me Oh, my beautiful one, now Your sins into me As a rapturous voice escapes, I will tremble a prayer And I'll beg for forgiveness (Your sins into me) Your sins into me Cold in life's throws, I'll fall asleep for you Cold in life's throws, I only ask you turn away Cold in life's throws, I'll fall asleep for you Cold in life's throws, I only ask you turn As they seep... into me, oh, my beautiful one, now Your sins into me Oh, my beautiful one Your sins into me As a rapturous voice escapes, I will tremble a prayer And I'll beg for forgiveness (Your sins into me) Your sins into me... oh Your sins into me Oh, my beautiful one, now Your sins into me As a rapturous voice escapes, I will tremble a prayer And I'll beg for forgiveness (Your sins into me) Your sins into... (Your sins into me) Your sins into me Oh, my beautiful one I cannot leave here, I cannot stay Forever haunted, more than afraid Asphyxiate on words I would say I'm drawn to a blackened sky as I turn blue There are no flowers, no, not this time There will be no angels gracing the lines Just these stark words I find I'd show a smile, but I'm too weak I'd share with you could I only speak Just how much this hurts me I cannot stay here, I cannot leave Just like all I loved, I'm make-believe Imagined heart, I disappear Seems...no one will appear here and make me real There are no flowers, no, not this time There will be no angels gracing the lines Just these stark words I find I'd show a smile, but I'm too weak I'd share with you could I only speak Just how much this hurts me I'd tell you how it haunts me I'd tell you how it haunts me (Cuts through my day and sinks into my dreams) I'd tell you how it haunts me (Cuts through my day and sinks into my dreams) You don't care that it haunts me...Oh There are no flowers, no, not this time There will be no angels gracing the lines Just these stark words I find I'd show a smile, but I'm too weak I'd share with you could I only speak Just how much this hurts me Just how much this hurts me Just how much you...We held hands on the last night on earth.Our mouths filled with dust, we kissed in the fields and under trees, screaming like dogs, bleeding dark into the leaves. It was empty on the edge of town but we knew everyone floated along the bottom of the river. So we walked through the waste where the road curved into the sea and the shattered seasons lay, and the bitter smell of burning was on you like a disease. In our cancer of passion you said, "Death is a midnight runner." The sky had come crashing down like the news of an intimate suicide. We picked up the shards and formed them into shapes of stars that wore like an antique wedding dress. The echoes of the past broke the hearts of the unborn as the ferris wheel silently slowed to a stop. The few insects skittered away in hopes of a better pastime. I kissed you at the apex of the maelstrom and asked if you would accompany me in a quick fall, but you made me realize that my ticket wasn't for two. I rode alone. You said, "The cinders are falling like snow." There is poetry in despair, and we sang with unrivaled beauty, bitter elegies of savagery and eloquence.Of blue and grey. Strange, we ran down desperate streets and carved our names in the flesh of the city. The sun was stagnated somewhere beyond the rim of the horizon and the darkness is a mystery of curves and lines. Still, we lay under the emptiness and drifted slowly outward, and somewhere in the wilderness we found salvation scratched into the earth like a message.

        &nbsp; Monday, June 14th 3:58 p.m. I have been making tons of graphics, and have updated Otherkin's site for the 3rd time this month. I just recieved an email from one of the pack members, Mousy, that she will be leaving. She was with the group for a long time and i'll miss her a lot. On the other hand we have had requests for three new members, so im excited.--squeak-- I havn't seen Mommae Fae in a few days --sniffle-- and I miss her. Hopefully I will be going shopping this weekend with my aunt Paula. We are going shopping for candles, cos I just love candles ^_^. I went to Hidden Lake with Stef-o Saturday night. Was pretty fun, and there were no mosquitos out that night. ^_^ Well I suppose I will get back to graphic production. --prances off towards my tree--  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"Love your hate, Your faith lost. You are now one of us!Nothing from nowhere I'm no one at all, radiate; recognize one silent call as we all form one dark flame. Incinerate"

        A lot has happened these past few days since i've last written. To start my dad broke his knee playing football with Johnnie. So he has crutches and a knee brace, he also will be home for six weeks. x_x Half my summer vacation is ruined due to this. --Sigh-- Then Roger was over all Saturday listening to music with my mom; he plays depressing music. But on the upside I was looking through his CDs, and found a few I liked and burned them :). Saturday and Sunday my parents spent most of the day at the doctors determining if my dads knee was broken, fractured, or just sprained. Then the MRI came back Monday and they went to the doctors once again to get the knee brace. Today I went to Stef-o's house ^_^.&nbsp; We did lots n lots of stuff. Jordan might drive to my house in the summer when he gets his car. --squeak--  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  "And how far have we come, too far to throw away the past Will you be there waiting for me I have to ask what we are, if I ask today it just won't last So I'll be here waiting for you"

        Mid Saturday, begining of summer... So much to do, yet so little ambition... I think maybe once I locate my Steffy, who is currently MIA. I will get some motivation to do something.  Mommae Fae is sad&nbsp;--sigh-- which adds to the depressing-ness. And Stef-o is still MIA. I skipped all my classes Friday (last day of school) and played cards with my friends in the cafeteria. For not reason at all that is depressing too. Last night daddy and I worked on my car. --big smile-- We are making good progress, we almost have it all stripped down to the frame. My next job is getting the rear facia off. I don't exactly enjoy getting my hands dirty, and sticking them into dirty rusty areas. But, thats the price you pay for father/daughter "bonding" time I suppose... The fair was here last week and I had fun there. Got a new hemp necklace, a mood ring (which facinates Stef-o), and a Quasar Pen!!! --squeak--  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel the need to go to Blockbuster (favorite store) and get a new movie. ~Randomness~ I have been spending a lot more time outside playing with my little brother; racing the 4-wheeler, and stuff. Im all excited I learned a few new card tricks, I have been teaching them to Johnnie. I still miss Jordan --whimper-- I think I may call him later, if he doesnt call me. He gets his license this summer. --smile-- My parents have decided to "ban" me from going in cars with my friends, unless they meet them three times. --rolls eyes-- They are still obsessed with finding out&nbsp;exactly "who"&nbsp;Jordan is, other than my boyfriend. --smile--  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  "I still remember the world from the eyes of a child. Slowly those feelings were clouded by what I know now. Where has my heart gone? An uneven trade for the real world. I want to go back to believing in everything, and knowing nothing at all. I still remember the sun, always warm on my back. Somehow it seems colder now. Where has my heart gone? Trapped in the eyes of a stranger. I want to go back to believing in everything"

        July 23, in exactly one month it will be my birthday wooohooo! Daddy bought me this coool add-on program for AOL that's called AOL Power Tools. Its so cool, its allows you to have multiple room owners (moderators). The moderators have keywords they type to boot people,and to un-boot them. Mommae is going camping for the weekend and will be back Monday, which sorta dulls the weekend a bit. Then to add to that Crossing Jordan will now only be playing on A&amp;E three times a week, instead of four. So now I have to wait all weekend til Monday to see the next Crossing Jordan episode. On Wednesday it was raining so hard that the grass could not soak up the water so it just laid on top of the grass. So Johnnie and I took the skimmer board and went skimming over the one inch of water laying on the lawn. Evidently we went skimming over the same spot one too many times and tore up the grass. Our back yard is now ::coughs:: a mud pit. But we had fun, that's all that matters, right?

          Well, I haven't written in over a month and sooo much has been going on. Okay, starting with the beginning of the month... Well, July 4th we went to a party at my Cousin Jennifer's house they had awesome fireworks! My parents got drunk and I got pissed and our family got to see the "other" side of Nikki. Then&nbsp;I went to Knobbles on the 14th with my grandma, aunt, Karen and her kids, my mom and my brother. Stef couldn't come so I ended up spending the entire day with Karen's 10 year old son Kevin. ::smiles:: But I must admit that was an awesome day, and I DID actually have fun with a 10 year old... Who would have thought? Paul is calling here and harassing my&nbsp;mom and we are just trying to start new and straighten out the family. &nbsp;So now we are looking for a new house somewhere close to here. Dads leg is getting better he's actually walking on it, he still has to go for physical therapy twice a week for a few weeks to build back his muscle. And that's July in a nutshell ::laffs::         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The world is spinning too fast&nbsp;I'm buying lead Nike shoes To keep myself tethered To the days I try to lose My mama said to slow downYou&nbsp;must make your shoes Stop dancing to the music Of Gorillaz in a happy mood Keep a mild groove on Ba ba baDay dee bop There you go! Get the cool! Get the cool shoeshine! There's a monkey in the jungle Watching a vapour trail Caught up in the conflict Between his brain and his tail And if time's elimination Then we got nothing to lose Please repeat the message It's the music that we choose Keep a mild groove on Ba ba ba Day dee bop OK bring it down yeah we gonna break out Get the cool! Get  the cool shoeshine!

         Looing through my window of time i've come to realize that I am so lucky to have the family and friends that I do... My mom loves me, i'm daddy's lil angel, me n Johnnie fight but he loves me and if I was introuble he'd be there to bail me out. ::grins:: My two doggies are everything a doggy owner could want in their pet. Bailey will protect me to no end, and Timber, well Timber is stupid and he makes me laugh. My best friend Stef is always there no matter what kinda shiz I get us into. Now that I found Jordan I have someome I can love with all my heart, which I do. And my mommae is always on here to cheer me up. :) And for all that I love you guys! Thanks!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Maybe we’ve been livin with our eyes half open Maybe we’re bent and broken, broken We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves? Somewhere we live inside We want more than this world’s got to offer We want more than the wars of our fathers And everything inside screams for second life
