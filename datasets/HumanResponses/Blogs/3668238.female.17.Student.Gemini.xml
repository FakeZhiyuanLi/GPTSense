      it was fun :)  Hey dad        I’m writing to you, not to tell you that I still hate you, just to ask you how you feel and how we fell apart, how this fell apart. Are you happy out there in this great wide world? Do you think about your sons? Do you miss your little girl? When you lay your head down how do you sleep at night? Do you even wonder if we’re all right. We’re alright. We’re alright. It’s been a long hard road without you by my side. Why weren’t you there all the nights that we cried? You broke my mother’s heart, you broke your children for life. It’s not ok but we’re alright. I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes. But those were just a long lost memory of mine. I spent so many years learning how to survive. Now I’m writing just to let you know that I’m still alive. The days I spent so cold, so hungry, were full of hate, I was so angry, the scars run deep inside this tattooed body. There’s things I’ll take to my grave, but I’m ok, I’m ok. It’s been a long hard road without you by my side. Why weren’t you there all the nights that we cried? You broke my mother’s heart, you broke your children for life. It’s not ok but we’re alright. I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes. But those were just a long lost memory of mine. I spent so many years learning how to survive. Now I’m writing just to let you know that I’m still alive. And sometimes I forgive, yeah and this time I’ll admit that I miss you, said I miss you.  It’s been a long hard road without you by my side. Why weren’t you there all the nights that we cried? You broke my mother’s heart, you broke your children for life. It’s not ok but we’re alright. I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes. But those were just a long lost memory of mine. I spent so many years learning how to survive. Now I’m writing just to let you know that I’m still alive And sometimes I forgive, yeah and this time I’ll admit that I miss you, said I miss you...hey dad -emotionless  ring ring ring ring ring ring ring - banana phone!   Rose said:   'When love abandons and hate dissipates, just a memory commemorates, a time spent not to forget, anger fades and there's no regret. done and dusted, emotion evades me, a place i trusted, left safety to save me.'   Rose says:  she no longer bleeds.

      war is every why are we so fixated with it?? its in present life, history lessons n now english lessons. tho i do love Brooke's work i guess i can't complain i get to study somit i love. and the book we're readin is quite good - 'birdsong' by Sebastian Faulks... 'A few months later, on his next visit, he took Isabelle for a walk in the garden and told her that he was being posted abroad and that he was not in a position to continue their friendship. he skated round the question of marriage with pleas of poverty and unworthiness. isabelle didn't care whether he married her or not, but when he said he would not see her again she felt the simple agony of bereavement, like a child whose only source of love has gone. for three years her loss coloured every moment of her day. when at last it became bearable it was still like a wound on which the skin would not thicken, so the least thing could reopen it. the reckless innocence of her unguided childhood was finished, but eventually a sweetness and balance in her nature returned.' this section stands out to me. the book has yet to mention war actually lol but a very steamy (and by the woman's description - very satisfying) scene! 'she was choking with passion for him, but he frightened her. she wanted to comfort him but also to be taken by him, to be used by him.' hmm i like this book lol newas gota go watch the match! sarah xxx

      i can't wait for things to get moving, i want out of here. im lookin forward to uni although it means another 3 years in england. it should be so much fun from my experiences of it so far and my brother's experiences. after uni though it will be another year i guess before i can move, as i'll need to work for 'bout that long to get some money. will be quite lonely i imagine as every1 will have moved on by then. i wana work in a pub, duno why, not any pub, not a big pub, i'd love to work the fox n hound by jill's - it's small n friendly, i think thats what attracks me to bein a barmaid - every1 thinks its somit to look down on but what's so bad bein surrounded by people in a friendly (if smoky :s) atmosphere? mayb im naive... also hav a job lined up with jill i hope :) i love the sound of what she plans to do and she says she'll employ me :) ur pretty much self-employed to be honest so it should happen n im into herbal homeopathic stuff so sounds good for me. after that id love to work in italy or canada. i cant speak italian so that leaves canada lol. although i don't have enough points for a visa :( i hav a friend who's gona help me as he's canadian (thats gota help!) and if i end up workin for a whole year before i go then that shld give me more points, plus im gona try learn french alongside my psychology degree, i wana speak french newas but now i hav a goal for it and will give me more points the better at it i am. the biggest problem is probably death - i.e. getting in a plane... ive been thinkin bout takin a flight course to help me feel more prepared for flying, but i don't see how im gona erase the knowledge that it could crash - and if it does it's the worst possible thing to be in that crashes. i dont wana die. if i do, i dont wana die like that. but then more than not wanting to die, i wana live, i know wot i mean... which brings me onto the fact that i realy should start jogging again. i wana b able to do the 10mile fun run next year to raise money for something that keeps catching my eye, i seem to read about it in magazines n papers all the time, n things through the door, it breaks my heart, if there's nethin i can do i wana do it. not because im such a great person just because ive seen the effects.... newas...will b a new years resolution lol im pathetic camp america should be cool too, wish it was this summer though as im gona b bored outa my brain n probs comit suicide for somit fun to do...talkin of which my mum thinks im on drugs, seriously do i come across as that abnormal n screwed? i guess we just have different views on what's normal, what emotions n behaviour are acceptable, whats good for us etc. o well arrivedechi x

      so im back - yay! rnt we all so happy bout that, i sure am. &nbsp; grr hav a pic called wind... wrote this (dont ask me why)&nbsp;but takin me ages to put it onto the pic  :(  Wind   She wandered down the cold stone steps; wind whistling through the thick air, causing her wispy hair to flutter about her face like black silk scarves in a teasing dance.  Foriegn leaves skittered after her, pushing her further away from their familiar habitat, chasing her to the border of her own world. Falling - to her inexorable melancholy bare-existance.  She'd like to see the arrow splintered in his pulse, she'd like to see his eyes flood with lies. Drawing in. Sucking; bleeding; watching you gasping. A little smile plays upon her lips, her eyes excitedly wide - they narrow again, as her fingers step to a lament only she can hear, echoing throughout her hollow mind.  Numb. Entrapt in this bitter wind.  Kneeling down in the dirt, one long nail traces a symbol. Lifting a blue teardrop from beneath small lashes - it's blessed. Rising, dizzy with energy, she falters, regains control, she holds the chains now.  She binds and sways the wind to her desire, encircling her 'til she cannot breathe. She'll take your breath with her instead.  &nbsp; blah blah blah, *skins herself n hangs it up to dry* 'take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green n the girls are pretty* wow i hav so much to say xBWx :( &nbsp;

      actualy im gona carry on writin cos now i feel even shiter and cryin again. y do i put up with so much crap from ppl wen ppl seem to turn against me so easily? so from reading joe's blog i realise actualy he kinda hates me now. wot did i say? tried to make light of a situation by sayin 'u gota be nice to me to get custody, n il stil get to live with u at weekends but mum in the week cos that seems to be how it works' there was no meanin behind that jus simply an observation or somit id assumed which was wrong. last time i try n joke about. i was harsh, tho truthful, cos i dnt handle ppl i care bout being off with me, im extremely sensitive - like i said weak n pathetic. so i said somit out of line, n seems ppl dnt kno how to forgive. well i never claimed to be a good friend or a good person, i do try, i jus suck. if ne1 i thort beca wld push me away cos i kno how hard it is for her but she dsnt seem to hold it against me hanging out wit joe, gona miss her next week. i dnt know how im gona handle next week. im not xactly in the mood for a challenge now.

      will post properly later, shld be in skool but instead listnin to music doin german coursework :s hoobastank are cool, for example - running away: I don't want you to give it all up And leave your own life collecting dust And I don't want you to feel sorry for me You never gave us a chance to be And I don't need you to be by my side To tell me that everything's alright I just wanted you to tell me the truth You know I'd do that for you Why are you running away? Why are you running away? Cause I did enough to show you that I Was willing to give and sacrifice And I was the one who was lifting you up When you thought your life had had enough And when I get close, you turn away There's nothing that I can do or say So now I need you to tell me the truth You know I'd do that for you So why are you running away? Why are you running away? Is it me, is it you Nothing that I can do To make you change your mind Is it me, is it you Nothing that I can do Is it a waste of time? Is it me, is it you Nothing that I can do To make you change your mind So why are you running away? Why are you running away? ...What is it I've got to say... So why are you running away? ...To make you admit you're afraid... Why are you running away?  hmm *turn music off...go to school!*  ~Disturbed Angel - Beautifully Decayed~
