      When I'm the only one on the server, I go looking for broken maps and dirty camping spots.  Well I was wandering around snowball and I found a broken map...  No doubt this has been found before, but I didn't know about it. :)     Map: de_snowball

      Well the teams are in, the dates are set and my bunch of unlikely soliders of fortune will be playing on the 1st July and 2nd July.  Exciting and scary all at the same time, seeing I've not been playing recently and I'm probably well out of practice!  Six teams and six rounds, top team from teams 1 to 3 and teams 4 to 6 will play in a final on the 4th July for the title of... err, best team out of the 6 playing I suppose. :)  If all goes to plan I'll watch England win in the Euro 2004 final and then help my team to victory in this tournament afterwards.  We can always dream!

      I might as well keep a track of weird and wonderful things that happen to me while playing Counter Strike, on this here very blog.  Which'll be nice.  Anyway, I play on the ES server, my user ID is not very surprisingly Telboy007.  The website is  urlLink www.enemyspotted.net , and you'll find IP and map-pack details there.  I'll be back later with piccies and stuff. :)

      ...well one more map anyway.  All credit must go to Roly for finding this one, although he did use my head to help find it. :)  I'm not saying how you get to wear Roly is, unless you pay me lots of money!  You can't see any of the enemy while you're up there but it's still good fun.     Map: cs_ephyra2

      Oh yes, another target audience reference with the title... where do they all come from?   Anyway Giantsboy, a newcomer to the ES server from the good ol' U.S of A was playing on the tank in scud, I've got a picture below for you.   But what's special about that you ask?   Well a few seconds after, Jodders came running through the double doors under the stairs and promptly got blasted away by the tank.   Headshot and everything... was very very funny.&nbsp; For us... :)       Map: de_scud

      Yep, on this very day at 20:30 ES have their first proper ED Ladder divison 3 game.&nbsp; Oh yeah, bring it on baby!&nbsp;   We've got one straight after at 21:30, so we'll have to see how it goes.  Fingers and toes crossed for two good results, to get us up that table!

      HAHAHAHAHA! &nbsp;I am king of blog post titles! &nbsp; Anyway, one thing I like about the ES.net server, are the plug-ins.&nbsp; Me fav has to be the gore plug-in... the screen shot below shows a glorious headshot spraying fast amounts of claret all over the place.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Messy, don't you think? &nbsp;   &nbsp; Map: err... one of the aztecs

      Ahh, nothing like a target audience reference to get things started ;).&nbsp; If you're a bit young to get what the title refers to... tough shit!  &nbsp;  Anyway, I changed my rates and stuff the other night and started to see weird things going on.  &nbsp; The funniest had to be Jester's talking head poking out the floor.&nbsp; See?  &nbsp;     &nbsp;  Map:&nbsp; cs_italy2  &nbsp;  And there's this one of a guy running through the ceiling&nbsp;as well...  &nbsp;     &nbsp;  Map:&nbsp; cs_office

      Bit of an old screenshot this one, just found it.  Unlike dust2, Winter Dust has a bit of a glitch or maybe it isn't... you can actually walk along the wall at this point in the map.  It's above the end of the underpass, CT side.      Map: de_winterdust

      A moment of truce between the two warring factions allowed a brief time-out for a bit of artwork, I present to you a montage.  I'm sure there's a hidden meaning in there somewhere...  I like watching lesbians but one of em's a right dog?   I like being surrounded by bitches?  (ooh, controversial)   Come to enemyspotted.net, where bitches like telboy007 play around?  Who knows...     Map: de_corsica

      I tell you what, the creator of cs_bikini is a dirty bastard but more on that later.  Had a break from the normal CT v T war on bikini and decided to take it easy with the ladies instead, so we had a bit of a pool party.  It's nice for the hossies to get out the house once in a while and let their hair down... in some cases they let some other stuff down too. ;)  All pictures taken from cs_bikini.     Pool Party - temporary truce as we relax with the babes by the pool.     Pink Dress - I take an unhealthy interest in the hossie wearing the pink dress.     Minge - holy poop, she's going commando!

      Yes, I am a fan of the up skirt shot and to appease all those up skirt shot fans out there I present you with this fine example.  I thank you.     Map: cs_bikini

      Just fractured my left elbow, so that's my CS playing days numbered for a few weeks at least.  Gutting stuff.  Lucky I can type pretty fast with one hand really.
