      Today is one of those days when I woke up, lay there in bed, and told Geoff, repeatedly, "I'm worried!"  "About what?" he would ask.  "Everything!" I would whine.    I'm better now.  It's always better after I get up, get out of bed, and get moving for the day.    I have the day off today.  I have a practice session scheduled for today at noon with Aggie, the hair stylist who will be doing my hair on the day of the wedding.  Then at 2:40, I am going to the dentist.  Is it weird that I am uncomfortably nervous about seeing the hair stylist, but I'm only excited and eager to see the dentist?

      Last night's wedding preparation: the coloring of the hair.  My hair color was looking pretty bad.  See?     My roots were looking even worse.     So I spent a few hours last night coloring my hair the color of "Sienna Luster," and now my roots look like this.       And my hair looks like this.     I like it!  (Well, I like the color.  It still has quite a bit of that post-traumatic-haircolor frizziness.)  I'm hoping it stays this color, roots and all, until at least the wedding.  It should still look pretty good in two weeks and two days, right?

      By popular demand, I hereby present to you:     The Invitations, and What They Look Like   Here is what a whole bag of mostly finished invitations looked like, back before they were sent off to their destinations:       Here's the back of the envelope:       Here's what they look like from the front, unopened:            Detail of the date at the bottom (and the little glittery glued-on round things):       And here's what they look like opened!       Opened detail -        I'm not sure the pictures do them justice, but you get the idea, right?

      Here is the story of the love knot cookies.    So, I found this recipe in Martha Stewart Weddings (apparently that should have been my first clue right there - I keep hearing that Martha Stewart recipes can't be trusted!) for love knot cookies.  They're sort of a sugar cookie that's rolled and tied in a knot and, if you're Martha, partially dipped in (white) chocolate.  I had been thinking that fortune cookies would be a cool favor for the wedding, to go along with the Asian Infusion Theme (TM by Laurie), but then I realized something very important: I don't really like fortune cookies much!  Love knot cookies sounded cool, and not  too  much trouble, since I love making cookies.  It's not a brand new skill, like the invitations or the flower arranging; it's a time tested talent!  I decided that I needed to make a test batch, though, to decide whether the "knot" part of the love knot cookies would be too big of a pain in the ass to deal with.   The first batch.   I first tried to make the cookies last week sometime.  The only ingredients in Martha's recipe were flour, butter, sugar, salt, and vanilla.  It was a very dry dough.  As I was mixing the ingredients together, I noticed little wormies in the dough.   Ugh.  I threw out the dough.   The second batch.   After I threw out the wormy dough, I got out my brand new bag of flour.  I checked for worms.  No worms.  I mixed up the ingredients.  I mixed and I mixed and I mixed, but the bowl was still half full of a powdery substance that could not possibly be rolled out into knots.  I decided to knead the dough by hand.  I picked up the ball of dough, and I mooshed the dry flour and other ingredients into the ball of dough.  Some of it stuck.  Some of it didn't.  I kept mooshing.  I mooshed and I mooshed and I mooshed, but the bowl was still a third full of powdery stuff.  It had been about fifteen minutes since I starting mixing and mooshing.  I threw out the dough.   The third batch.   I decided that the recipe of dry ingredients could bite me.  I looked online for a new recipe, and every other love knot cookie recipe that I found had eggs in it.  Aha!  I printed off one of the recipes (six eggs!) and took it with me to my mom's last weekend.  On Sunday, we started making the dough.  Mom pointed out the canisters on her counter, and took the lids off of the two that contained flour and sugar.  I measured everything out and mixed it up.  This time, there was plenty of liquid in the dough.  In fact, this time there was too much liquid in the dough.  The dough was about as liquid as very thin pancake batter.  And, as a bonus, it had a couple of worms in it.    We added cornmeal and birdseed to the dough.  Then we baked it and put it in the backyard for the birds to eat.  It's worth noting that we did realize what had happened with this third batch was not the recipe's fault.  It turned out that when I thought I was adding flour, I was really adding powdered sugar (I don't keep powdered sugar in a canister on the counter!), and I had even thought to myself, while I was scooping it out, that its texture was funny - "ooh, her flour is different than what I use!" I thought.  That didn't stop me from scooping three cups of it out and pouring it into the mixing bowl, though.    So, to sum up.  Worms in flour or powdered sugar?  Bad.  Powdered sugar instead of flour?  Bad.  Love knot cookies?  A pain in the ass.    I'm thinking about making sugar cookies instead.

      Hi, I'm Jessie.  I'm getting married in 18 days, but I am only freaking out about it  some  of the time.    Today's wedding-related purchase: a  urlLink guest book platter .  Not only is it a cool idea, but the woman who makes the platters is extra super nice - I spoke to her on the phone today when I called to see whether or not I could get one of the oval shaped platters in time for the wedding, and she was full of helpful hints and information about her products.    I am a total spazz today.  I'm not upset, I don't feel bad, I just can't focus on anything for more than a few minutes.  Is this just how it's going to be for the next 2 and a half weeks?  (Did I mention Geoff's sister Stephanie arrives here in Chicago - to stay with us - the Monday before the wedding?  I figure that means there's now less than two weeks before The Festivities begin.  Urg.)

      When I was about 2 and a half years old, bruises started appearing all over my body.  My parents didn't know what was wrong, but noticed that if they put any pressure on my skin at all, a bruise would appear later, where the pressure had been.  I ended up spending a few days in the hospital.  The doctors there figured out that my body was destroying all of the platelets in my blood.  They never did figure out  why  that was happening (they guessed it was an allergic reaction to something, maybe aspirin), but they did figure out how to make it stop.  They made it stop by giving me shots of steroids.  I got a shot every hour, on the hour, for three days or so.  (My first memory is of a time when I saw the nurse coming with another shot and took off down the hall on one of those bright yellow ducks with wheels.  They caught me, of course.)    It turns out that when you are between two and three years old, your body is putting together the materials to make your adult teeth.  It also turns out that steroids have a bad effect on the body's efforts to make enamel.  What can happen, if you were between two and three years old at the time that somebody shot you full of steroids, is that many years later, when your adult teeth start to come in, those adult teeth will have what is apparently referred to in the dental world as "mottled enamel."  If this happens, the surface of your teeth will be pretty ugly.    When I was in the 4th grade, our whole class was doing pull-ups on the side of the swimming pool in gym class, and one time on the way down, back into the water, I misjudged the distance between the side of the pool and my own head.  I hit my front two top teeth on the side of the pool.  The inner corners of the two teeth crumbled into the water at the pool's edge.  Immediately, an image of myself, a grownup, with teeth that looked like they belonged on Hee Haw, flashed through my head.  When the dentist took a look, he decided that the reason my teeth had crumbled so easily was because of the mottled enamel, and so he decided to cover up more than just the front two teeth.  He decided to cover up the front six top teeth.    Ever since then, my front top six teeth have been, off and on, covered up with either veneers or bonding.  Veneers and bonding are good, because they allow you to keep your own teeth, which is a good thing (at least that's what they tell me).  They are also relatively inexpensive, compared to permanent crowns or caps.  The problem with them, though, is that over time, the bonding material discolors (it starts to turn yellow), and eventually, the bonding just falls off.  My teeth have been looking pretty crappy for awhile now.  Here's what they looked like last Friday, in various stages of disrepair (the front two have kept their bonding but are going yellow, and the others have lost their bonding - I don't exaggerate when I say they are ugly):      Until the Friday before last, the last time I'd gone to the dentist was about a year and a half ago.  I got a check up and a new filling, and according to that dentist, under the insurance plan I had at the law firm, it would cost me between $500 and $800 to have those front top six teeth re-bonded.  I've been putting it off ever since.    Then a few months ago, my friend Allen told me that I should just get my teeth fixed, before the wedding.  He would loan me the money, and I could pay him back when I had it.  (Allen is pretty cool, and pretty generous, too.  Shhh.)  For whatever reasons (I've been busy, and I procrastinate about the dentist), I didn't call to make an appointment until it was suddenly a month before the wedding.  I got an appointment for the Friday 3 weeks and one day before the wedding.  I have an HMO dental insurance plan, and I'd chosen a dental office that was close to home.  Sears Dental.  It did not occur to me that Sears Dental was  the  Sears.  In a Sears.  Right next to the portrait studio.  I kid you not.  (The smiling portraits from the portrait studio were up on the same wall next to the smiling portraits from the dental office.)  I was momentarily frightened.  It turned out to be the best dental experience I have ever had, at least in my adult life.  The dentist was a woman in her 30's, friendly, calm, eager to help me out.  I told her I had three weeks until my wedding, and so I was throwing myself on her mercy. If she had time to fix my teeth, I would be grateful, and if she didn't, I would understand.  "You have three weeks until your wedding?" she said.  "Well, we will just make sure it happens.  If you have the time to come in, I will make the time to do the work."  She was great.  After that, she voluntarily went over and checked my insurance plan to see how much it would cost me to fix my teeth.  "I think we should cover the top eight front teeth," she said.    The cost to me?  Zero dollars for the front four teeth.  $30 per tooth for the four teeth behind those.  $120 to have my smile repaired.  It would take about a half an hour.  Oh, and I had no cavities.  So last Friday I went to the dentist to have my teeth fixed, and a few hours later I left with my teeth looking something like this:      Did you forget how bad they looked before?  Here, compare!       Look at them!  They're like normal teeth!  (No, not  those , the ones above!)  And you can't see it there, but she actually fixed the top TEN teeth and only charged me for the top eight.    Thank you, Dr. Olson.  You're a real live Tooth Fairy.

      I got in to work today to find a voice mail from  urlLink Ike .  (You can read about Ike in that entry from a year and a half ago.  Ike is an attorney who used to be a partner at the law firm where I worked after my second year of law school.  Ike opened his own office about a year and a half ago, and is apparently doing very well.)    "Hi, Jessie, this is Ike.  I got my copy of the new Sullivan's [the directory of Illinois lawyers], and I looked you up, and thought I would give you a call.  I'm wondering if you would be interested in...making a change.  And if not, well, maybe we can just get together for lunch."    I am excited and afraid to be excited at the same time.  This is the third time (in four years) that Ike and I have talked about me working for him.  Each of the other times (like this time), I was amazed at his good timing.  I felt like something great had just fallen into my lap.  And then it turned out that nothing had fallen into my lap at all.  So I'm trying not to get my hopes up too much.  In my voicemails to him (in response to his message from Friday, I left a voicemail, then he left one, then I left one, then he left one, then I finally got him in person), I tried to convey "eager but not needy," but maybe it doesn't matter too much.  This is the man who said, a year and a half ago, when I asked him if he wanted me to send him a resume, "Oh, no, I don't need a resume from you.  You're a known quantity.  You don't need to prove anything to me."  And did I tell you that my old friend and boss Andrew called me the other day to ask me what I remembered about a case that had resurfaced, and I ended up saying to him, "Oh, when you talk about writing a responsive brief, it makes me sad, because I miss doing that."  Did you hear that?   I miss writing briefs.   (I also miss going to court, but I try not to even focus on that.)    Ike and I are having lunch this Friday at 12:30.  Wish me luck, ok?

      I just wanted to say that I am getting married  tomorrow , and everything is insane, and I can barely type because my wrists and hands are so stiff from spray painting PVC pipes and terra cotta pots this morning in the basement with my dad, and I still have one more mix CD to burn today, and we still have to arrange flowers, and we have to print the programs and scroll them up and tie them with ribbon.  And I am scheduled for a manicure at 4, and rehearsal at 6, and rehearsal dinner at 7, and then trying to get some sleep before tomorrow.  It is all perfect, in a way, even when it's insanely not perfect and out of control.  My friends are amazing, wonderful, sweet, generous people.  Most of my family is that way, too.  The phone rings off the hook, and the door buzzer goes off every few hours or more often (more people will be here in 15 minutes), and this may be the last time that I am able to sit down at the computer and type anything to you, so I wanted to say thank you for all of the warm wishes that you've been sending me over the past few days, and for all of the cranes, and for all of the email and e-cards.  We have over 1000 cranes!    And I'm happy, and I'm weepy, and I'm excited, and I'm nervous, and today I didn't get to take a shower until almost noon even though I'd been trying to since about 8:30.  This is how it is.  These are days I'll remember forever.  That's all for now.  Thank you, all of you.  I'll miss writing here!  I'll save up pictures and stories for you!

      So yesterday I was a mess.  I felt horrible and irritable, and when I talked to Geoff I was hateful and grumpy.  So much for pre-wedding bliss, I thought, as I crouched on my hands and knees, scrubbing the kitchen floor and the baseboards with a sponge, and felt sorry for myself.    It was mostly hormonal, the overwhelming irritability that I felt yesterday, and yet telling myself that there was a biological reason for the horrible way I felt didn't do much to relieve the horrible-ness (horritability?).    But then what happened is that after I yelled at Geoff for not having done as much wedding stuff as I've done (and while I was yelling, I knew that I was just mad without having any real reason for it), he sent me a profusely apologetic email, which made me cry.  ("I love you like crazy.  Thank you for marrying me," he said.  How could I not?)  And that was the end of the irritability.  I was just me again, a little sadder and a little more tired, but without the hostility that had been with me earlier in the day.    I picked him up from work, and we went to Target and Office Max and Home Depot, and while we were in Target, my brother Josh called my cell phone and told me that he was in Philadelphia, on his way back toward Chicago after leaving Amsterdam yesterday morning, and could he stay with us when he arrived.  Of course he could.  Then we went to O'Hare to pick up Geoff's sister Stephanie, and then we went to a Red Lobster out by the airport so that we would be out there when Josh called, if his flight got in any time soon.  (Stephanie had the Ultimate Feast.  She also had a strawberry daiquiri.  I think the Red Lobster trip was a success, if not one that will be repeated any time soon.)  Just as we were finishing dinner, Josh called from O'Hare, so we went back to get him, and then there he was, my little brother, standing at the airport with a huge backpack on his back and more bags at his feet, and we pulled over to get him, and he smiled at us.    I am so glad to have him here.    And Stephanie, too - after we picked up Josh, I drove us downtown (so we could look at the nightscape) and then back up to our apartment on Lake Shore Drive, and Stephanie oohed and ahhed over everything, or at least everything that she's heard about in commercials shown in Canada for places that don't exist anywhere near her.  ("Ooh, Bally's!"  "TARGET!!!"  "Outback, I think I've heard of that!"  "What about Krispy Kreme, do you have that?")  We all laughed, and the car was full of that warm feeling that you have on holidays, when you're with these people that you love way more than how often you see them would seem to indicate, and you are all laughing and tired and happy to be together.  We got home, and it was the same way.  Josh made us citronella tea with citronella leaves that he brought back from Italy, and he presented us with a bottle of olive oil made from olives that Josh had helped to pick not more than three weeks ago, and we all padded around the apartment and got ready for bed in a step by step way.  PJ's.  Brushing teeth.  Blankets for the guest bed and couch.  Let the dog out.  Stephanie gave us a card for the bride and groom in which she'd written, among other things, "I love you both and I love you together."  She said she had cried when she wrote it, and I started to cry reading it.  After Stephanie was in bed, and after I got Josh settled in on the couch, I went into our bedroom and got in bed with Geoff (and Molly).    I stretched out and scooted down under the covers.  "They're funny," I said.  "I like them."  "Yeah, it feels good having them here," Geoff said.    And it really does.    I had thought that once people started to arrive, I would feel even more anxious about anything that still needed to get done, and even more stressed about how little time was left to do it in.  Instead, I just feel grateful that they're here, and that they're such nice people, and that they came here to see us get married, and that they love us.    Everything's going to be wonderful.

      How did it get to be FIVE DAYS before the wedding?  How?  This would probably be a good time to try to capture this insanity that I'm currently experiencing, but the problem with my insanity is that it doesn't lend itself well to description.  I feel on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  I don't think that I will really have a breakdown, of course, but that's the feeling that's with me today.  I still have to make CD's and print programs and spray paint our crafty stuff.  I still need to make a list of "must take" photos and finish stringing cranes.  We need to talk to the chaplain again.  We need to talk to our photographer.  I need to finish with the cookies and package them up for presentation.  I need to cut the foam core stuff to the right size to go in the flower pots.  We need to drop off the check with the cake baker.  I need to mop the kitchen floor and Swiff the whole apartment again and put clean sheets on the bed in the guest room, because we pick Geoff's sister Stephanie up at O'Hare tonight at 6.    She called last night to make sure that someone was going to be there to pick her up, and then she asked if she could take us out to eat afterwards, her treat.  Sure, we said.  Geoff was on the phone with her.  "Can we go to Red Lobster?" she asked Geoff.  "Sure," I said.  "But why?"  She's seen lots of commercials for them, she told him, and the commercials make it look really yummy.    So tonight we are going to go eat at Red Lobster with a girl who will have just flown here from the Atlantic Coast.  Score one for Red Lobster advertising.    Friday we got a card, check, and note from my aunt Lisa, who was 14 or 15 when I was born.  The note was my favorite part.  She wrote that she is sorry that she won't be able to come to the wedding, but that she'll be thinking of us.  She wrote, "I remember when you were born, and I showed your picture to my friends.  We were all amazed that you were the prettiest baby that we had ever seen!  I have continued to be amazed and delighted throughout the years."  What a great aunt.  I love her.    We got a lot done this weekend.  Rebecca and I shopped.  I bought a purse, and white slippers, and some honeymoon "clothing," and candles and napkins (pink and orange!) at Ikea.  After we got home, we made pink & orange spritz cookies with the cookie press.  We also picked up my wedding dress.  And it looks beautiful.  It's gorgeous, and it fits me (without me having to suck in or anything obnoxious), and the seamstress put in buttons and loops to bustle up the train, and she put darts in the bodice, and she hemmed it an inch so I won't (hopefully) step on it (too much).  She reattached some beads that had fallen off.  It's lovely, and it's at home in our huge, newly straightened walk in closet where the cats normally live but which, for this week only, they are not allowed to enter.  For this week, it is the Room of the Dress.    I was completely unprepared for how much the alterations would cost, because I assumed (and you know what happens when you assume) that they would not be too much.  Of course, "too much" for one person is "not much" to another, and so when Dina of the Golden Hands looked at me and said, "two twenty five" I just stared at her as if she were speaking another language, as if "two twenty five" was code for, say, "eighty dollars."  And of course she doesn't accept credit cards.  So I wrote a check.    The dress is perfect, though.    And yesterday I went to brunch with  urlLink Wendy  and Ericka (who does not, in spite of much urging, have a journal at this time).  Wendy is the coolest, and she picked me up in her car and drove me out to Arlington Heights.  And Ericka is the coolest, because she brought me one gazillion strings of lights that she is loaning me for our reception.  As a bonus, she also brought fake greenery and other strings of lights with white paper cones over the lights.  And she is making me something to hold wedding cards.  Then I came home and we cleaned the pantry and the kitchen and the back room and the bathroom, and we did laundry.  And then  urlLink Erin  came over to help me string cranes, and Erin now holds the coveted title of "Master Crane Stringer."  Oh, yes, she does.    And this weekend I talked to Laurie and Tracy and Allen and Candace and my mom.  I have 975 cranes now.  All but about 140 or so were strung by people other than me.  They were strung by people like you.  I am so grateful and amazed.    So Erin and I strung cranes, and then I went and had chai tea and French onion soup (I had those things, she didn't) with  urlLink Liz , and she let me talk and talk and talk way more than my fair share without complaining one bit, and it was good, because for the hour and a half or so that we were there, I forgot to be worried or scared about anything wedding related.  And now here I am at work.  I am about to go drop off my engagement ring to be re-sized, and then I am leaving here early so that I can go home and do some of those things that need to be done.

      The picture below isn't a whole picture.  It's really only a part of a picture.  But this picture, even though it's only a part of a picture, has been fascinating me for the last couple of days.  You know why?    Because other pictures, I see them and I know that they represent how I looked on my wedding day.  Mostly, they look nice, and mostly I like the way I looked.  But still, in some of the pictures I see, I can't help but be distracted by a shiny forehead or a weird expression or too-much roundness of the chin.    This picture, though, is different.  When I look at this picture, instead of thinking about how I  looked  that day, I think about how I  felt .  This is how I felt.     (I felt good.)    The original picture is nice, too (although oddly enough, the original looks a little bit like I've been photoshopped into it):

      We're home! We're married!  We had a lovely wedding, a "super cool" reception (as my brother said) and a terrific, relaxing honeymoon.  I'm going to have Geoff help me out with an official wedding entry, and we don't have many pictures yet - no good ones of me and Geoff together, for instance - but here are a few of the ones we do have.  (Taken by either Candace or Allen.)       At the salon, getting my hair done by Miriam.  (In the full sized picture of this, you can really see my tired eyes.)    Before the ceremony, in the bride's room at the chapel, with Laurie, Candace, and Tracy.    At the reception.  My brother Josh, looking at me.    Me, a morsel of wedding cake, and more of the inside of my mouth than you ever wanted to see.    At the reception.  My husband (!) with Candace, Rebecca, and Elizabeth.    Candace, Allen, and Emily (yes, they're sisters).    The bride.  Happy, glowing (literally!), and tired.

       I love every color blue.    Leaving Chicago (on the way to Indiana)....        Stop and go.       Sunset blue highway.       Sunset blue exit ramp.       Sunset blue curve.       Darker blue highway.       Darker blue and colored lights.     Leaving Indiana (on the way to Chicago)....        Gray blue sky and empty fields.       And a tree.       The sky ahead was striped with blues.       Almost sunset.

      Last week I took part in a project called  urlLink America 24-7 .  You can read more about the project if you follow that link, but the basic premise is that for one week, 24 hours a day, thousands of photographers (hundreds of thousands, according to the website) took digital pictures that they then submitted to a central location.  The organizers of the project hired professional photographers to take part in this, but they also accepted submissions from anybody else who wanted to participate.  The best of the photographs will be published in books and on websites.    The point of this is that all last week, I carried my digital camera around with me all the time, like I used to, back when I first bought it.  And what happened is that I took a lot of photographs of things that I otherwise wouldn't have, and I ended up with photographs that I wouldn't have otherwise had.  Photographs that I liked.  Photographs full of color and movement and light and dark and silliness and seriousness and weirdness and every day-ness; what I liked most about the pictures, in fact, was not the individual artistry of any one or two particular photos, but the differences between them.  The range of life they captured and displayed (if that doesn't sound too high-falutin').    Ok, maybe the real point of this is that when the week was over, and I had taken all of these pictures for the project, I started wondering why I don't take more pictures all of the time, for my own projects.  So last night I started taking more pictures.  And here they are.  These are the abstract photos.          And these are the pictures of the city, on our way in from I-290.           And below are the pictures of one of my very favorite Chicago photo subjects: Buckingham Fountain.  (See the blurriness in a lot of them?  That's because it's damn hard to hold a camera still for 1 or 2 seconds, especially when it's windy and you're shivering from the cold.  Based in large part on these photographs, I finally broke down today and ordered myself a tripod!  I'm excited!  I'll be a professional yet!)                                  Blurriness aside, you can see why I love Buckingham Fountain, can't you?

       	 		 		 I walk to the train on work days, now, and on the way I pass a building that looks like a castle.  There is always a FOR RENT sign on the front gate, and whenever I'm getting ready to look for a new apartment, I wonder about the apartments in this building.    Last time I wondered aloud when I was with my friend Elizabeth, and she told me that the reason that space is always available there is because the owner is kind of a nutcase.    I still like to walk by and look.  There is a lion's head on the front gate that looks like a door knocker (except, of course, that it's not on a door).  This is a picture of the lion's eye. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink Lion's Eye 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink jessamyn8470 .

           My little girl and I, along with my friend Rebecca, are flying to Louisville today to visit our dear friends Laurie and her son Jack. It will be Katie's first plane trip, obviously. As if she knew that today might be a hectic one, she slept over 9 hours in a row last night. Wish us luck! (If you read this before 1:00 p.m. central time, feel free to leave comments with any flying- with- babies tips you might have.)   Geoff took this picture of Katie the other day. Her happiness is so apparent that looking at this picture makes me teary.             urlLink My little girl is the happiest girl and the happiest girl is she   Originally uploaded by  urlLink jessamyn8470 .      She slept horribly last week. She kept waking up and crying, over and over, until later and later times. 11:00. 12:00. 1:00. 1:30. And then she'd wake up every couple of hours after that, too, crying each time. By the fifth night of this, she hadn't stayed asleep until 1:30 in the morning, and she'd woken up at 3:30 and refused to go back to sleep after I'd nursed her, because she wanted to  play  with us. All three of us were exhausted.   It was probably a combination of a lot of things. She is teething. She outgrew the car seat where she'd slept every night since she was born, and she now had to sleep on the vast and unsnuggly crib matteress. She had her four month check up and got another four shots. We had recently returned from a road trip - she slept so much in the car that she couldn't get to sleep at night.   She was so grumpy and so touchy, it was a delicate and&nbsp;difficult&nbsp;job to keep her from crying. At bedtime she would cry and cry no matter what we did - no matter how often we fed and rocked and held her. And so finally, after that fifth night, we decided that we would put her in the crib for the night, and we would let her cry for awhile.   All three of us cried that night. (I felt like I should cry the whole time she was crying, in sympathy and as a result of my own very real pain to know that she was so tired and unhappy.) But after awhile, she went to sleep, and she slept the longest she had slept in awhile. After she woke up to eat, she then went right back to sleep.   It was the best night's sleep she'd had in awhile, and when I looked in on her at 6:30 in the morning, she was lying on her back, kicking her legs in the air, cooing softly to herself. When she saw me she went wild with the "hey!" sounds she makes, and with arm and leg waving. She gave me a huge smile.   That was Monday night. The next night she didn't cry at all, and we didn't know what to think. Wednesday night she was back to crying for awhile. The crying was mostly fussing this time - she didn't sound like she was hurting, she just sounded like she was angry. It was easier to deal with, but I was still crying for her by the time she went to sleep.   And then last night? I put her in her crib, she said some irritable "hey! hey!"'s at us and she muttered to herself a little bit. She didn't cry. After about 15 minutes, we didn't hear anything else. Asleep at 8:45.   She didn't make another peep until 5:50 this morning.   I know there are a million opinions on whether you should ever let your baby cry if you can help it, and if you do, when?&nbsp; For how long?&nbsp; I don't know what's right.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end, we decided that one long stretch of crying that results in a good night's sleep is less of an evil than eight or nine shorter stretches of crying that are interspersed with chunks of sleep no longer than two hours (and sometimes as short as 10 minutes).&nbsp; I wouldn't presume to tell you what would work for your child. I don't know. I'm not even sure yet what works for mine. (But don't write me and tell me that you know better than I do, ok?)   When I went into her room this morning at 5:50, her little body practically writhed with glee. She was so content, so happy, so excited to meet the day.  &nbsp;  It is overwhelming, how much I love her - how happy it makes me to see her so happy.   Parenting (already, even when your child is barely four months old) can be so hard. Of course, it's also (already, even when your child is barely four months old) amazingly wonderful.

But how long ago can it have  been , since it was recent enough that elevators were already in existence?    This is from a building that is split in two - one half is the Cook County Building, the other half is City Hall.  The details of the building are worthy of a whole series of photos. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink PUSH 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink jessamyn8470 .

       Professional Haircut   Tuesday night I got what I think was my first professional haircut since before our wedding in November 2002.  I often cut my own hair and end up happy with the results.  But the last time I cut it, I used a pair of very dull scissors.  Not so smart.  I was pretty excited to have somebody else repair the damage I'd done.      Here's my new haircut.  I like it!  It's entirely possible that it would be wise to continue paying to have my hair cut.

       	 		 		 Geoff was away at a conference this week, so my mom came up to stay with us and take care of Katie while I've been at work each day.   You can't really tell from this picture, but Katie is delighted by her Grandma.  They've had a great time, but I know Mom will be glad when Geoff returns and she can go back to more of a grandparent role, able to hand off the baby when she gets fussy.   I'll be glad when Geoff returns, too, for those reasons and others. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink Katie and her Grandma 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink jessamyn8470 .

       	 		 		 I was in Marshall Field's when I took this picture. Right after I took it, an employee approached me with an irritated look. "You can't take pictures here, ma'am." Really? I asked him. Not in the whole store? "Not in the Thomas Pink section, ma'am."   So you know what I did. I walked until my feet were no longer on the floor of the Thomas Pink section, and then I turned back toward it and took a few pictures of it. They weren't very interesting, but I didn't let him stop me from taking them, by God.  I showed him! 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink Rainbow 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink jessamyn8470 .			 		 	   I taught the Louisville Airport a lesson, too.  Rebecca and I got really irritated with them a week and a half ago before our flight back to Chicago.  When we arrived, we read the signs, got in the appropriate check-in line (according to the signs), and then were told that we needed to be in a different line (there was no apology for the signs being wrong). By then, of course, people who had arrived at the airport after we had, and who should by all rights have been behind us, especially since they apparently didn't even read the signs, were in front of us.    Then, to add insult to injury, the lines we'd originally been ousted from were re-opened, so a big group of people who'd arrived at the airport after we'd been moved from one line to the next moved over to the new line and got checked in immediately.  We were still waiting in our line.    When it was our turn, the employee wasn't friendly to us at all.  We asked about a plastic bag for Katie's car seat, and without showing any regret at all, she told us that they were out of bags, but that "we don't expect any bad weather."  Oh, well, if  you  don't expect it, then I'm sure we're fine!  (As it turned out, there was no bad weather, but the LATCH hooks for the car seat were lost in transit, never to be seen again.)  By then we were irritable in general, so every tiny rude interaction left us mumbling and grumbling.  After we'd gotten through security, I went into the restroom while Rebecca waited in the hall with Katie (who was in her stroller).    There were two rolls of toilet paper in each stall.  As I was pulling toilet paper from one of the rolls, I noticed a small red sticker behind the other roll: "Please pull from smaller roll."    I noticed that I was, in fact, pulling from the  larger  roll, not the smaller, and I thought to myself, "Ha!  Fuck you, Louisville Airport!  Take that!"    The moral of these stories is that I am not to be trifled with.  Marshall Field's and the Louisville Airport are still reeling, I'm sure.

       	 		 		 Did I mention that Katie did great on the plane, sleeping through not only both flights, but also through the hour that we sat on the runway before our flight to Louisville took off?    She is doing great, overall, although I have been informed that she is worrying her Grandma today a little bit.  My mom is here taking care of Katie - today is their first day at home together.  I think it's going ok, but that (not really a newsflash, but easy to forget for anybody who doesn't have to do it every day, me included) it's a tough job to take care of a nearly-five-month-old.  The fussing, the sleeping, the eating, the grabbing, the chewing, the babbling.  The attention-demandingness of it all. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink Chicory 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink jessamyn8470 .			 		 	   Katie and I had a relatively difficult day on Saturday ourselves.  Geoff packed for his trip and left for Indiana at about 11:30.  He spent the next four hours or so driving to Anderson.  Katie and I spent from about 11 in the morning until 4:30 in the afternoon trying to get her to sleep.  Finally, she slept for an hour and a half.  And then she woke up, and it was 6:00, and where had the day gone?    She made up for the difficult day, though, by going to sleep at 8:45 and not even making  a peep  until 4:30 in the morning (at which time she ate and then went back to sleep until 8 am!).  Heather & Arek (who live upstairs) had the monitor with them while I went to  urlLink Erin's bachelorette party  for a couple of hours, and they never even had to come downstairs.   This afternoon after I'd talked to my somewhat stressed-out mother, who'd called to let me know that she was a little stressed-out, I called her back.    I let her know that there was chocolate on the nightstand next to my bed, and that she shouldn't be afraid to use it.  Chocolate will help at least a little bit, right?  (Katie and I didn't end up going on any of the mini photo shoots that I had envisioned.  I took the photo above on Saturday morning, before Geoff left on his trip.  I have always loved the blue flowers of the chicory weed. Is that the same chicory that goes into coffee?)
