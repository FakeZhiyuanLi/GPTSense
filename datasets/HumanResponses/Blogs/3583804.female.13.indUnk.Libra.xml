      i went out today...wore a skirt... i'm not used to wearing it, so it feels a bit weird...i was supposed to do the maths project with angel today, but she backed out again...the present tat we bought for sheng ming is already wrapped...i am jus scared tat he would throw it away first without even opening it...do u think tat would happen??i dunno...one more day to school reopen...i don't want it...i rather not have any holidays at all as after holidays, i would feel so scared when i return to school...how???i got so many troubles and worries to worry and trouble...so many things to do...must pack this,pack that...do this,do that...check this ,check that...why must there be long holidays???i rather not study at all,or study all the time...what do u think???well,maybe some of u don't agree with me,but i really am scared...i forgot how i am supposed to behave, and i will panic in the middle of class,and this and that....how?????how?????

      Judging from the title, u could probably see that i had nothing ta do today...In the morning,I woke up, and said my good mornings, than ate, then watched television...later,i wanted to call angel, but i wanted to let her rest...she looked very pale yesterday in the late afternoons...Lionel had to return the disc tat he borrowed from the cd shop, thus he came over...the rest of the day,was watching television, and more television, and more, and more, and more...
