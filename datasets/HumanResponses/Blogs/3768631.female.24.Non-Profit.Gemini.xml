      Today at least my shift at LAX didn't last all that long. This one rebellious 16-year-old pulled a fast one on us and purposely avoided us when we were waiting for him. I know he saw us too, because we made eye contact and my Frat boy co-worker and I were very obvious in flashing our signs as we waited for him at the gate.  Some of these kids think we are there to baby-sit them, which is only partially the case. It's not like we chaperone them on trips to the bathroom. The reason we are there is to make sure they get on their international flight. All airlines, especially in the high seasons have a tendency to fuck up. Therefore, we need to be there for these kids when the airline does fuck up. Also, it's not all that easy to re-book an international flight in the summer. Many are already full for weeks, which is why we need to be there and make sure these kids are on it. Plus, we are a non-profit that already puts these kids on the most ghetto flights. Leaving us with no room to foot the bill for re-booking them IF they miss their flight.  Most of these kids have to fly United to Tokyo and Australia, which are VERY long flights. Having flown my share of international airlines, I can tell you United sucks and I would not want to be on United for one of those international flights. The food probably sucks and they charge for booze, which is never okay in my book when I am on a very long international flight. However, I'm sure United is cheaper than Quantas or Japan Airlines, which probably offer much better service at a bigger price. Fuck, when I flew China Airlines to Bangkok, I was sitting in coach and I had a video game machine and my personal choice of movies. In addition, to an all-you-can-drink booze and extra food if need be. As a 21-year-old at the time, I remember fully taking advantage of the all-you-can-drink option. *smile*  Anyways, I don't work again until Sunday and next week will be kinda dead for my job. I'm going to use my time to do some research on grad schools in Australia and finishing my Peace Corps medical clearance. Oh, yeah about the grad schools in Australia. This is something I am just doing as a backup option to Peace Corps. Just in case for some reason I don't like the invitation I get or I don't get medical clearance. You never know? However, I do know after learning the hard way that it is always good to keep your options open.  Grad school in Australia doesn't start until February, thanks to that country being in the Southern Hemisphere, which means my applications are due in September. I already found a few schools who have degree programs in MA's in Globalization and another in International Studies with various diciplines that I can focus on. Another perk, is grad school in Oz is way cheaper and I can still get financial aid. Oh, and yeah I forgot to mention that I don't need to take the evil GREs and many of the programs are only one year to a year and a half. Oh, and the boys are literally kinda hot on that continent. I know because I've met my share of them through my travels and I even made-out with quite a few and I must say I am quite impressed. *Swoon*  *sigh* At least I have been busy, busy the past few weeks. However, thanks to my fabulous job I still have time to annoy my friends on the job through calls and IMs and read a good book. Right now I am re-reading Douglas Coupland's Generation X. Fabulous book, and I appreciate it more at 24, than when I read it when I was 20.
