       i'm packing for assessment.  my attitude about the whole thing stinks and i already miss my boys.  pray for me (us).  deep inside i have this really good feeling that God is going to do something good through all of this, but i seem to dwell on my surface feelings instead.    i had a lot of visitors in grandview yesterday.  first, tami and alison.  then, doug.  it couldn't have come on a better day.  eric was gone from 8:30 am until about midnight.  it would have been a really lonely day if my community hadn't been around.  you guys are my family and i love you all.  kerri

       No need to bring a dessert tomorrow night. McKenna is going to be hanging out with us all day and her and Riley are going to make 4th of July cupcakes.  So, just bring a side dish of some sort.  We are grilling pork chops, but we can throw a burger or hotdog on for anyone who doesn't like pork chops. As for Red, White and Boom--Eric has to work until 7:30 so he will be meeting us there before the fireworks.  I will be leaving from 827 NW Blvd. at approximately 4:30.  If any of you get off work early and would like to meet at my house that would be great!

       Two things for this week: 1. Wednesday night at the Stetler's--we'll have meat for the grill and drinks.  Bring a side dish or dessert. Directions: take 670 to Grandview Ave. exit Turn Right onto Grandview Ave.  Take another right at Goodale.  Take a left and Northwest Blvd.  We are 827 Northwest Blvd.  You can make a u-turn right past our apartment and park on the street.   2.  Friday night--RED, WHITE, AND BOOM! One of my very favorite nights of the year.  Three Stetler's will be there (Trey has a sitter).  The traditional Stetler/Pressley spot to watch the fireworks is right outside City Center.  There is a corner where buildings are painted on the walls with a huge grassy area.  We love it because it's a pretty good view and not very crowded. We like to spend the evening there, pack our dinner, and relax.  We will be there around 4:30 pm. Come, bring some snacks to share if you want, and blanket, and a frisbee.  I think Chris and Amanda Copeland will be there too, so it should be a lot of fun to see them again.

       I got a call from my mom about an hour ago.  She told me that my sister, Alyssa, had outpatient surgery today at OSU East.  That was a suprise!  Apparently she had a lump removed from her breast and when the doctors got in there, it was somehow unusual and different from what they expected.  I don't know what that means, but they have decided to keep her for the night for observations and testing.  Please pray for her.  I hope we aren't going through all this again.

       Hello to everyone!  There has been a change of plans for next week.  As you probably already read, Kerri's dad turns 50 on Monday and she thinks she should be with her family instead... Happy B'day Mike! Instead of Monday, we are getting together on Wednesday at Eric and Karri's place.  I'm sure Kerri will post directions and other details later.  I just wanted to let everyone know so you can plan to be there.  Also, if you have nt yet made plans for Red. White, and Boom, a group of us will be meeting downtown.  More info on that will also follow.  Apparently Ryan is back in town.  He emailed me and said he was gone for 10 days to work at the US Open....what?  I want to know more about this.  Ryan, if you're reading, what's the scoop?

       I made a mistake! Monday the 28th is my dad's 50th birthday.  So, we won't be able to meet here that night.  I don't want to screw up your monday/wednesday rotation, but we could meet here on Wednesday.  Or, someone else could do Monday and we could do the next Wednesday.  Something to think about, we can talk about it tonight! Can't wait to see you guys!

       Next week we will be getting together on Wednesday at Alison and Sharon's apartment.  Will one of you please post directions in the comment section.  We don't have a food theme this week so how about we all bring our own food this week and plan to all be there so we can all eat together at about 6:30 pm.  We have decided to get together on Mondays and Wednesdays of alternating weeks.  Since we are meeting next week on Wednesday (June 23), we will get together the following week on Monday (June 28).  Do we have any volunteers to host us on the 28th?

       how would everyone feel about expanding the online community to those who have moved.  Kerri and I feel that we are still connected to you or "plugged in" as some might say, but I would like to see ryan, chris and amanda, bruce, and others posting their thoughts from anywhere, usa.  what do you think?

       I finally made it on.  You know I went back to work part time this week.  I found out they aren't letting me have my complete job back because they don't think I can handle radiation and a full time job.  Well the challenge is out! They assume I will be there only this week and then gone.  Let the challenge begin.  By the way pray that I can keep this up.  If other people can work and do radiation so can I. I just love this Blog  Debbie

       Each day this week has felt like it has lasted forever. My dad is off work this week to "help" with my mom. The past two days I have been painting the back bedroom for Alexis. Monday wasn't too bad and I had more kids that day. Tuesday I only had three kids and none of them were infants so my mom could watch the kids without doing anything. I painted while the kids were sleeping and then Kohl's called and asked me to work. I went to work at 6 and got home at 10:45. I'm back at it again today. With only four kids my mom can keep an eye on them and my dad and I have been back painting. My back is starting to show the effects of the last two days and I still have to work tonight. I don't really regret my decision to help my mom. This sounds weird but I am looking forward to the different experiences I am going to go through in the next couple months. I should go see what the kids are doing.(I should at least make sure they aren't tearing down the house;) I hope everyone is having a great, faster moving week.

Let me know where you are meeting.  Then the next week is at our place.  I'm sure you guys had a great time last night.  How was Doug's pizza?

       what are we doing when we meet together?  why would we continue such tomfoolery week in and week out?  What holds us together?  What keeps us from moving on to another spiritual family for a while?  What keeps us from just staying home and watching tv, reading a book, the bible even?  Lord knows that would be so much easier.   ... blog this.

       Douglas, We are waiting anxiously for a word on how your retreat went.  I think this computer is signed in as eric, but this is actually kerri.    Girls--(and any guys who might be interested)--I'm ready to plan a shopping trip.  We could still do the Eastland thrift store trip--another option, Rag a Rama.  I haven't been there but I hear it is awesome.  That is where we were headed the day Eric totalled the car!  Any takers?  Any date suggestions?  I'm booked this Friday and Saturday, Sunday is an option.

       Alison and I wanted to invite everyone over Tuesday (JUne 8) for group at our house. I sent out a regular email but thought I would try it out on here too. We are planning on having pizza so all you would have to do is bring money and we will provide the drinks and dessert.

       Eric stole my thunder.  I couldn't wait to blog about our week but by the time I got our internet back up and running he had already beat me to it.  I'm going to blog anyway!  Thank you so much for your prayers this week.  God shocked us to say the least.  We met some unbelievable people who became good friends in three short days.  We were able to mess with their heads some as they considered the definition of "church." We passed our evaluation with a score higher than most receive and never had to compromise who we are or what we believe to be true kingdom living.   There is a lot more to say about the details of the week, but that we'll be some good stories next time we see all of you.  We love you. Kerri

       a quick update... blogging from the cafe @ kenyon college.  i guess you could say that kerri and i were somewhat surprised at what happened this past week here.  I you would have told us that we would actually like the kind of people that would show up at an event like this we would have told you that you "didn't understand."  we totally expected to be misunderstood, rejected, and "red-flagged", but none of these things happened.  the director told us that our presence was influencial not only to those involved in the assesment with us but also to the process itself!  they affirmed our passion and calling and gave us unconditional approval to plant simple churches under the banner of nazarenedom.  this, we did not expect.  so this means that our relationship with the nazarenes is developing.  it still isn't the focus by anymeans... they would like it to be, but if we begin to listen to the voices that say, "if you build this thing up, if you are a success, if you crack this case of 'urban planting', then we will hold you up as a model for the denomination..." then we have taken the bait of significance in the eyes and arenas of man... lord help us to continue to be us.

       I am excited that we did this. Thank you Doug! I am so worried that I won't get to see anyone this summer because of my psychotic work schedule. Wednesday, June 9th is the date for my mom's surgery. I am watching her kids Monday and Tuesday, off Wednesday just in case something happens and I have to go to the hospital, and then I am watching them Thursday and Friday. Kohls is being wonderful about giving me hours so I can still pay my bills. If you all could remember my family I would greatly appreciate it.

       One more month of summer and then I go back to the daycare. This summer has been crazy as most of you know. I feel like all I do is pick up after people. I unload the dishwasher&nbsp; when I get to my mom's and load it throughout the day as we have breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner. The majority of nights I don't even get to eat dinner with my family. I have to get ready and leave for work before my family eats. I have turned most of the cooking over to my mom so I don't have that to deal with&nbsp; anymore.&nbsp; I go to work at Kohl's and pick up after customers who are to lazy to pick up after themselves. After folding clothes at work I find it very difficult to clean my own room at home. I did find away around that though, if I fold my clothes before I go to work I am more likely to put them away when I get home.&nbsp; Since moving into the apartment with Alison I found it very hard to sit down and relax when I know there is something I could be doing. There are nights when I get home and cannot go to bed until I empty the dishwasher. Not because I think Alison won't do it because I know she would but because it is something that I know should be done and I have the time to do it. I remember when I used to be able to sleep till noon or later and wouldn't care if I had something to clean. I could sit and watch tv without worrying about anything. Am I getting old or just taking responsibility?

       I think we all agreed, at least those who where there Monday and blogged on here, that Wednesday the 11th would work. Do you want me to go to Kroger and get the tickets? I need to know exactly how many people to get tickets for. Kerri, is your mom going to be able to make it? Another thing we need to think about is how we are going to get there. It would save us on parking if we went together, but we need to figure out a time, place to meet, and who can drive. If you have any ideas on any of this please let me know. I need to get the tickets before the start of the fair to get them at the reduced price. If you could blog, email, or call me and let me know that would be great.  Fair food here we come!

       Our group get-together on Monday was a great way to refresh oneself.&nbsp; Present was Sharon, Debbie, McKenna, Katie, Brian, and myself.&nbsp; It was great to see some people that we haven't seen for a few weeks.&nbsp; I really do miss people when they are not around.&nbsp; I hope we can get a few more people there next week.   As you already know, we decided that we will get together every Monday at Alison and Sharon's apartment, so everyone knows what day and location.&nbsp; Next Monday will be low-carb Lasagna night.&nbsp; I'm skeptical in the products but have great faith in Sharon's cooking ability.&nbsp; It will be a small adventure that we will all go on together.&nbsp; Please add whatever you plan to bring in the comment section.   We also decided to assign each person a week to share their "story".&nbsp; We did this in the past, but we have a few people that were not around then.&nbsp; We want to hear their stories and they want to hear ours, so we will all do this again.&nbsp; This time, we can expand and perhaps get into issues we were tentative about bringing up last time.&nbsp; Sharon has volunteered to go first and will have the spotlight this Monday. (Yes, Sharon volunteered.&nbsp; She wasn't coerced into going first this time.)&nbsp; After this we will all begin talking about where we are and how we can help each other move forward.&nbsp;   I think we are starting to get back to the feeling of this being "church" for each other.&nbsp; This is good.

       I hope by writing the menu for next week this early we will accomplish two things: (1) People will sign up to bring things and (2) People will come. Last night Debbie, McKenna, ALison and I had a fun time. Next week we are going to have a Mexican theme. Debbie said she will bring the seasoned meat.&nbsp; I hope you all can come, just respond with what you can bring and we can go from there.&nbsp; I hope everyone is having a good week.&nbsp; I think Erin Ledbetter, a girl from high school, might be coming with her daughter Emma.&nbsp;

       Since no one wrote about dinner Debbie and I decided on chicken. I will make baked chicken marinated in italian dressing and Debbie said she will bring salad.&nbsp; We have dressings so you don't need to bring any Debbie.&nbsp; I hope you can come. If you need directions and/or have any questions call me @ 596-8082.

       Now that I know Katie is going, I'm definitely in! Debbie, could we do a week night? I know Sharon can't do the first weekend of the fair and I'll be out of town the second weekend.&nbsp; Is there a particular week night that might work better than the others?&nbsp; I assume we are doing no kids this year? I can take Riley to see the animals on a different day so that our eating doesn't get interrupted by horses and&nbsp;sheep.&nbsp; He was well behaved when we went last year, but I'd enjoy a girls night.

       Okay Ladies and anyone else who wants to venture out with us. I read the other day at Kroger(yes the same day that guy walked up to me) that they have a special on prepurchased fair tickets when you use your kroger plus card. You can get tickets for $8 I think, but anyway if you buy four tickets you get one free. Let me know when is good for you all. I have to watch the Settele girls the 6-8th of August but any other time is good with me. Just let me know so I can call Heather R. and get off work. I'm sad that I won't get to see any of you this week but I'll have great Settele stories when we get together next Monday. Love you all!

       Just thought I would finally let you know what I have been up to this summer.  Crazy, I tell you.  Right now I am working mad hours at MCE.  I have a set schedule Thursday thruSaturday working in the registration department.  And I am also working at a tech. In the ER wiping butts, getting urine samples, and collecting blood.  Sounds like fun huh?  Actually I'm loving it.  I know what you're thinking.  I'm special. But, while I'm working in two different departments I'm also taking classes that the hospital requires.  Waste of time!    Any ways I'm on the go all the time it seems.  It seems every summer flies by!  Darn those flutter bies!  I also miss you guys tons:)  Hopefully we can all get together soon.  David is also doing well.  He is officially a R.N. and working in the ER.  He is great at it, but I have never seen him so stressed.  I'm sure he'll settle in soon, he just has a lot of responsibilities.

       How would you feel if we changed the schedule of dinners to Monday nights at Alison and my apartment. We won't start this until July 19th, which is the following Monday. That means we will skip this week so we can have more time to let everyone know about the changes. I will post another blog about what we will have that night so if you have any suggestions please let me know.

       I figured out why we aren't getting more people to come to our dinners. I was at Kroger getting stamps and a raincheck when a man came up to me and told me I was "looking good". I had never seen him before. His next question caught me completely off guard and is the reason for my first sentence of this blog. He asked me if I was Catholic and then when I said no he said I should be. I told him I would try to work on that. He said something about be a member of the Knights something, I had never heard of them. It was an interesting encounter and I wanted to share that with you all.

       I read this devotional last night after the small gathering we had at our house last night. I felt during some of the conversation like I was completely lost and had no clue what the solution was to the issue before our community. It amazes me how I can feel one moment that I am miles away in a desert completely away from communication with God and the next moment He's saying "Wake up stupid,(even though He wouldn't be so mean)I'm telling you exactly what you need to do if you would only listen."  See what you all think of what Oswald Chambers has to say:  We always have visions before a thing is made real. When we realize that although the vision is real, it is not real in us, then is the time that Satan comes in with his temptations, and we are apt to say it is no use to go on. Instead of the vision becoming real, there has come the valley of humiliation.               Life is not as idle ore,               But iron dug from central gloom,               And batter'd by the shocks of doom               To shape and use. God gives us the vision, then He takes us down to the valley to batter us into the shape of the vision, and it is in the valley that so many of us faint and give way. Every vision will be made real if we will have patience. Think of the enormous leisure of God! He is never in a hurry. We are always in such a frantic hurry. In the light of the glory of the vision we go forth to do things, but the vision is not real in us yet; and God has to take us into the valley, and put us through fires and floods to batter us into shape, until we get to the place where He can trust us with the veritable reality. Ever since we had the vision God has been at work, getting us into the shape of the ideal, and over and over again we escape from His hand and try to batter ourselves into our own shape.  The vision is not a castle in the air, but a vision of what God wants you to be. Let Him put you on His wheel and whirl you as He likes, and as sure as God is God and you are you, you will turn out exactly in accordance with the vision. Don't lose heart in the process. If you have ever had the vision of God, you may try as you like to be satisfied on the lower lever, but God will never let you.

       OK, here is what I know from the comments left and from speaking with people. Monday - Neither Alison nor Sharon are available. Tuesday - Doug is not available Wednesday - Alison is not avaliable Thursday - Neither Doug nor Katie are avaibale Friday - Katie is not avaiable I have not heard from anyone else. Here is my recommendation.   Meet Tuesday night.   This has worked is the past and still seems to work best for most people.  I recommend meeting at Alison and Sharon's place, but you two need to confirm if this is ok or not.  As far as food, that's up to you guys/gals. What I am really trying to do is set up a time so everyone is available to get together.  I miss seeing Ryan, Tami, Brian, Melissa, Sean, Mikey, etc. Is there a weekend day or night that might work for everyone?  Perhaps we can set up a web calendar so everyone can post nights they are available.   Please, everyone who gets this blog or email, leave a comment or reply back with the evenings you are available next week (Sat. the 10th thru Fri. the 16th).

       Hello everyone!  I know many of us are getting together this Friday for Red, White, and Boom, but I wanted to start making plans for next week. I know many of us have had a hard time getting together due to schedules, but I would like to try to get all of us together on whatever day is possible.  I can't get together on Tuesday or Thursday, but if the rest of you prefer one of these days, that would be great.  Please reply in the comment section with the days you are available and if you would be able to host the group on any particular days.  If we cal all reply by Saturday night, we can set the date and place and post it late Saturday or Sunday morning.  Thanks!  I really hope we can all get together.

       I LOVE FAIR FOOD!!! Last night we girls (Alison, Katie, DebbieM., Kerri, Debbie P., and I) walked,  ate, talked, ate, laughed, ate, saw the sights, and ate. Did I mention we ate? I so broke from the South Beach diet and loved every minute of it last night. I can't go into all that went on while we were there because as you know what happens at the fair stays at the fair.  I did discover one thing from last night: You can get a hang over from food and even though I've never had a "real" one it can't be any worse than the way I felt this morning when I woke up.  We need to have more girls nights because once a year is too long to wait.

       Last night was really good. We had an indoor cookout with hamburgers on the George Foremans. We also had a full house with 8 people. Ryan came as did a friend from high school, Erin L. and her daughter Emma; Katie, Doug, Brian, Alison, and I were all there. Brian shared his story and I learned some interesting things about him. Next week I asked to be lazy and we are ordering pizza, I think we are going to get it from Eagles since we haven't ordered from them in awhile. I know I plan on cheating that night. All you need to do is show up with pizza money and we will provide the rest Lastly, Doug asked everyone last night to pray for his sister while she is going through her treatments and whatever else comes up. I think we should pray for the whole Herlensky family as they are dealing with all of this.

       On Monday night, we had Alison, Brian, Debbie, Doug, and Sharon. Sharon shared her story with us. I learned a lot about Sharon. This was a great way to kick off our new rounds of stories. We also had the infamous low-carb lasagna, which turned out to be very good.  Next week, Brian will share with us. I hope all can make it. We also decided that next week will be burger week. Please leave a comment to let us know what you will bring.
