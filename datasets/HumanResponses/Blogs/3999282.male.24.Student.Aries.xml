      Finall I had a chance going clubbing with my friends alone after 4 yours (I went to BarCode at 1236 Broadway) ^_^ I had tons of fun today and drank a lot too: one Chinese-white, one 151, and one whatever.... It was my first time having the experience of being drunk. I still feel dizzy now, you can find out easily by my poor English grammar....  Anyway, it is time for sleep now

      My bro and me played tennis for 2 hours today. Man, I am getting old. After two hours of game, my right wrist were so sore that it shakes when I tried to grab a cup of water.  I bought a boxer today using my new debit card at Sears. I was really happy while I was giving my debit card to the clerk. I pressed the wrong button while dialing (chequing account instead of saving since my old debit card is saving). Anyway, I will try to use my VISA some other day....   I Watched Bourne Supremacy with my bro this evening. It is a pretty good movie, because it is free!?  Anyway, I will try to do some readings now and hope I can finish the chapter by this weekend

      I suddenly feel that I grow up when I receive my first PERSONAL cheque book with only my name on it and my first debit card. It may sound silly but I am really happy now. Finally I can spend the money from the scholarship I received and also manage my money.   Today I am going to do more readings about molecular biology, let's do it now

      Edith talked to me 2-3 days ago and I found out that I still have feeling on her. I hate myself being weak, being manipulated, and being fooled. She only treats me as a spare tire and I know it. Whenever I heard something from her my heart beats irregularrly. Come on, she likes Roch and she cheated on me. When can I wake up?   I am happy that I did some progress with my molecular biology reading. Let's keep the hard work and get ready for graduate student life^_^

      Damn, I am too weak now. I tried to work-out for only 30 mins and my muscles were sore for 3 days. Hmm.... I think I should put work-out in my daily activity at UofT.   I've been excited about my first mutual fund since I bought one. I read a lot of articles and finance for dummies, did some research and enjoy it!! I can't wait to see my first lump-sum to double its values.  It is 5:57am and I am still awake because I am talking to Edith. She told me that she is a changed person and she will go to Toronto to see me. We will see

      Finally I got my mutual fund worth CDN $8,000!!! It may not be a big money for others, but it is certainly big for me ^_^ I am glad that I made the right dicision yesterday not to choose the previous financial advisor. The FA today is so nice to me and let me feel safe when I put my money into the balanced mutual fund. Now it is time for me to continue my molecular biology reading and get ready for my new graduate student life.

      I just asked my friend from Taiwan to buy a cell phone for me. The features are: color screen, with a flip, and less than 4,500. I personally think it is stupid to buy a cell phone for more than CDN $500. I can buy a digital camera AND a cell phone with that price.     I haven't started my molecular biology readying since I came back from Japan. My god, I have lots to catch up. The conversation with Debby today was pretty fun. Can you believe that Debby told me to treat my ex better!! I am so happy to have a friend like her than my ex, Edith, who is a bitch. Oops.... I guess I haven't got over with that relationship yet...     2:33, time to sleep

      I talked to a financial advisor called Terence today for about 1 hour. He has lots of experience since he is the only one who has stayed at Waterhouse. During that conversation, I found out that what I mean to him is just a cheque with $8,000 on it. So I decided to "fire" him, that is, not to choose him as my financial representive. I will talk to another asian guy called Cedric tomorrow at 12pm and hopefully he is a nice guy who cares about me instead of my money. After the mutual fund investment stuff, I really have to go back to study for my molecular biology since I am way way behind.

      Hi everyone,    I am Jason!! Ironically I found this website by the guy called Roch whom my ex has been cheated with. But oh well, I've got over with it and start to have my own life.     I opened my personal account yesterday. Can you imagine that? Open my first account when I am 24? my god, what kind of person I am? Anyway, I will also talk to a financial advisor at TD trust for investment regarding mutual funds and stocks. Wish me luck.    I will try to keep posting if I still remember ^_^

      My brother just took off his 4 wisdom tooth today which costs CDN $1,100. It is worth. I am really happy for him because he won't need to suffer the same pain as I did a year ago.  I received a card from Lotus today. She wrote "Dear Jason, How is everything? Man, really envy you... You are still a student and I start to work already. Good luck when you go to Toronto. remember to see me when you visit Taiwan" She is a really nice girl and I will write her a letter once I am in Toronto.  The Sony-Ericsson Z200 cellphone is sooo cool^_^ The UI, and keypad, the flip, and rings..... I just like it!! I can't wait to start my new life there.  I can't recall what Edith looks like now, which is good. Sometimes I am still too childish, always want to win the "GAME". Thinking carefully, I didn't lose anything: I had a great time with her; I learned a lot from her, regardless they are positive or negative; and I got her first time (let's hope it was a lie too). She has the right to be with anyone, whom I think is bad luck :P

      I watched AVP (Alien v.s. Predator) with my bro and his friend, Wilson, today. It was awsome! I enjoy evey minute of it (although it only has 90 mins), especially the fighting. Just like my bro said "If anyone asks me what is that movie talking about, well... AVP" lol  I bought "Ladies & Gentleman  The Best of George Michael"  two days ago. It contains 24 the most popular MTVs of George Michael. Totally worth it!!  Two weeks left and I am heading to Toronto. Whether being excited or nervous, I am going to take that chance to learn as much as possible.  Last weekend to enjoy and I will get back to work, Good luck to me

      Man, I got my laptop screwed today. I bought a crappy DVD-writer (brand name is Mercury but the writer is LG?? what the hell!) and it ate 6gb of my harddrive. Trying to fix that using Partition Magic 8.0, I screwed up my partition so that I couldn't turn on my laptop properly. Luckily I exchanged that crppy writer to the best one, HP DVD movie writer, so that I can finally make my recovery dics with DVD ^_^  Stephen went to see a dentist today and the tentist told him to remove two wisdoms next Tuesday. What a progress!! I tried my best to convince my bro to see a dentist and it worked^^

      It rorks!! I had a great time this evening watching firework at downtown with my friends: Jack, Jack's cousin, Roger, Tony, and Natelie. I also took tons of pictures, although only ~40 pictures are on focus ^_^  Edith Emailed me at train station today, but I deleted that email like usual since I don't want to be a spare tire and I really want to get over it.  Tony told me some tricks to get 6-packs today. I am going to try them tomorrow and hopefully it works by the time I am in Toronto  peace out
