      All things must start somewhere, even so my blogging. Hopefully, I will remember to update this regularly, though I somewhat doubt it myself.  Anyhow, I'm in the middle of my summer vacation, which really isn't, but that's what it's called. I've gotten hired to do some work for the local school, which will provide me with enough entertainment to fill the empty spots in between the two lab-courses I'm doing during the summer. Not to mention the exam scheduled for August, which I only found out about today. Ah well, them's the breaks.  So, without further ado, off I go to spend the last free time I've got until school starts again...after which I will have even less...oh God, I'm starting to sound bitter.

      Well, there goes a few weeks without me remembering about this thingie. I'm guessing I'm probably trying to forget all about it, on a subconscious level.  Anyway, as for today's title, I was recently given a gasoline lighter marked "Zippo", which I filled and field-tested for the first time today. Turns out it didn't exactly live up to the brand reputation, as fumes made their way out in dangerous places and ignited. Sort of like a miniature molotov-cocktail. Luckily, I'm a pessimistic cynic by nature, so things didn't get out of hand. It now rests safely covered in sand in a barbecue pit.  Apart from my pyromanic pursuits, I participated at the aforementioned wedding. In a rented suit, a bit tight and a whole lot less airy than my regular clothes, on a hot summer day in a room filled with people and with no air-conditioning. If I had managed to put on the tie, I'd probably have been suffocating as well, but as things were I just melted.  The wedding itself went smoothly, the groom's father conducted the sermony and his mother cried a bit. The bride was quite beautiful in a white dress, and the groom seemed quite at home in his slightly unortodox tuxedo.  No more from me for a while. I'm not the type to bother with these things overmuch, as any wannabe-readers have probably understood by now.

      I just remembered I had a blog somewhere...after locating the server, I discovered I could remember neither the account name, the password nor where to find my own blog. Things worked out after all, but my absentmindedness is getting out of hand. I'll have to start considering ways to organise my life properly. **NOTE: This is version two of this post. The first was in the wrong language. Q.E.D.**  I'm expecting southbound visitors in the morning, the day after that I'm supposed to participate in a wedding, as best man. At the same time, my computer's chosen to make my life even less peaceful, but fortunately some alternative drivers was available. They're not quite as good, but for the moment I'm satisfied with them working at all.  I rented a suit for the wedding, it was picked up today and is black and quite neat. I'll probably have to borrow a tie from dad, as I have none of my own...or maybe I do have one. We'll see.  But, anywho, that's it from me for today. B'bye.
