       You can make a difference In your corner of the earth. You can reach for higher goals, Encourage human worth.  You can help the others To accomplish all they should. You can find a way To reinforce the cause of good.  You can try to understand the problems of the few. You can be a voice of kindness Gently passing through.  You can search for purpose In the many tasks of men,. If you choose to make a difference, You're the one who can.    Bruce B. Wilmer

       My mother and I continue walking west on Twenty-third Street. She grasps my forearm between her fingers and leans toward me, confidentially.   Tell me something, she says. Is Maddy what they call a homosexual? Yes, I say. What do homosexuals do? she asks. They do everything you do, Ma. What do you mean? They fuck just like you do. How do they do that? Where? In the ass. That must be painful. Sometimes it is, mostly it is not. Do they get married? She laughs. Some do. Some don't. Are they lonely? As lonely as we are, Ma.  Now she is silent. She stares off into the middle distance in an odd, abstracted manner that has developed in her over the past year or so. She's alone inside that faraway look on her face, but this is different from the alone I'm familiar with, the one that distorts her features into a mask of bitterness, the one in which she is counting up her grievances and disappointments. This look is soft not bitter, full of interest, not a trace of self-pity in it. Now when her eyes narrow it is to take in more  clearly what she knows, concentrate on what she has lived. She shakes herself as though from a penetrating dream.  People have a right to their lives, she says quietly.     Fierce attachments - by Vivian Gornick

       Once upon a time, in a concentration camp, there was a prisoner, who had just been sentenced to be executed. Few days later, he was seen in the middle of the prison square playing his guitar. A large crowd of prisoners gathered to listen to this strange music, which seemed to make the prison walls disappear. When the prison authorities saw this, they immediately passed orders forbidding the condemned man from playing the guitar.  Next day, the man was back in the square singing and strumming his guitar, for a larger crowd. The guards dragged him off and amputated few of his fingers.  Next day, the man was back in the square, singing and strumming his guitar with whatever fingers that were left, to a cheering crowd. The guards smashed his guitar.  Next day the man was back in the square, singing with all his heart. What a song !  The crowd joined in and sang with their hearts and for those brief moments, they were free. So angry were the prison authorities, that they caught the man and had his tongue torn out, in front of the crowd. The crowd was speechless.  And watched a torn bleeding broken figure, stand up and sway and dance to a music that only he could hear. And the crowd also heard that same music and were helpless but to dance and sway to that music.

       When I die , give what is left of me , to children. If you need to cry, cry for your brothers ,walking beside you. Put your arms around anyone and give them what you need to give to me. I want to leave you with something, something better than words or sounds. Look for me in the people I have known and loved. And if you cannot live without me, then let me live on in your eyes, your mind, and your acts of kindness. You can love me most by letting hands touch hands and letting go of children who need to be free. Love does not die, people do. So when all that is left of me is love. . . Give me away. . .   ::author unknown.

       Say I have a large basket with a very coarse weave. The holes are about 10 cm wide. Into this basket, I normally place pineapples. These are big fruits and they are held very well by the basket. One day however, I encounter some longans. I put them into the basket. They all fall out of the holes, and there is no way I can carry away the longans that I have found. I curse the longans for being small. Never once do I question whether the basket was designed for pineapples.   Extracted from The Yawning Bread.  urlLink   Read more

        i regret not knowing more about the French revolutions and whats happening at that time by the people in France and America. so this review reflects the lack of&nbsp;historical & cultural background knowledge.     &nbsp;  juxtaposing empty ideas and lustful games with the revolutionary tension on the streets, the movie plays on the dreamlike lifestyle 3 young people extravagantly indulge. the suffering and emptiness of meaning in life in each individual is implicitly woven into the fabric of socio-political turmoil of that time, rudely and shockingly threatening the comfort of the audience with each 'bizarre' whim. the slow process of suicide through gaseous intoxication seemed to be idealised as a perfect escape deeper into a dream. it is thankfully shattered by the reality in the streets.&nbsp;&nbsp;   the older generation, quietly and almost shamefully represented by the twin's parents, flaunt cheques in compensation for the rift and confusion across a generation. their voices of concern and political/poetic nuances were drowned&nbsp; by the first scenes and never recovered even at end of the movie.   unconvinced as a love lost in definition between a man and a woman, and between siblings, i would only see a fulfilment of needs of two siblings, sexually expressed through a third party, who is a foreigner to the country and the family, and who can never be an extension of the twins nor a partner in the woman's life.   can the enactment and reenactment of scenes in the films by the trio be mocking at the many revolutions? does the success of the revolution acknowledge the efforts of dreamers-in-the-streets in making dream a reality?   &nbsp;  :::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Its official website:  urlLink http://www.the-dreamers.com/ &nbsp;

      &nbsp; -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -     As I closed the book at the last page, I thought of searching something in me that needed a voice. I needed to tell and hear for myself as I talked this kind of life that people are living at another corner of the continent.   &nbsp;  The contributors in âRestoried Selves: Autobiographies of Queer Asian/Pacific American Activistsâ (ed. Kumashiro, 2004) resounded a concerted tune of confusions and ostracisms they faced on the basis of their colors and sexual/gender orientation. Each of their re-stories ended off with a firm and clear note of reconciliation of diverse identities, self-acceptance and the wish to see tolerance among people they love and people they do not know but nevertheless live with in the common living space. Towards generating a community of support for themselves, the activists were also spurred by the empathy they felt for discriminated and oppressed people of other minority issues. The progressive movements are slow and painstaking, but it never deserves to cease because the silence needs an open space to assert its right to be seen and honored. And the space needs to be fought for.  &nbsp;  In adolescentâs inadequacy at the lingo that speaks other than hetero-sexuality, many shared the common process of internalizing unspeakable curiosity, fear, shame, alienation and isolation, and a conscientious or heedless neglect of this growing desire that bites into the collapsing security we had built from childhood. The society that could not miss the colored from the whites, when at the same time, following a ritual-like dismissal of their presence, tempted the APA to take refuge in academic achievements that reinforce their stereotypical image of âsubservient, quiet, and hardworkingâ Asians. The adolescents are mostly compelled to grapple with identity issues arising from their multi-cultural family and ancestral backgrounds in the face of condescending remarks hurled at them in high school and colleges.  &nbsp;  Yet the book is not a collection of accounts from trying adolescents, but a celebrative work about growing up and out in pride and grace, by adults established in their professions. Containing truthful personal revelations, this book related the stories that lead the individuals to activism.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::   Restoried Selves: Autobiographies of Queer Asian/Pacific American Activists .

      This is known to be the only gay-themed play so far, specifically by Toy Factory,   for the grrls  . Donât know if this is a rumour but is certainly a tasteful treat for the ladies.    People-like-us   are treading on a socio-cultural-romantic path that is highly intense, insecure and sometimes isolated; and that is insofar factors in social environment are making themselves a nuisance in the romantic relationship. Not riding on this opportunity for over-statements, but thatâs how the play affirms my uninitiated experience.  Drama is not as commonplace in everyday lives, so many are spared of the conflictual & complicated emotions main character,  Toh Yi Ling , went through. She married out of   friend  - ly  love to a man and gave him the best   present   she can ever give - a daughter, who fortunately has no appearance in the play. They married out of a contract: that the man would allow the best freedom he can give the woman, in return for a complete but sexually-unfulfilling   family  . He deserved many hugs of sympathies, as he quitted his flying career and gradually reduced himself to a male-maid in market, a househusband in kitchen, a eunuch in bed. But  Toh Yi Ling  never fail to remind that that is a contract of mutual agreement â a contract that informs  no clause for regrets .  The scene where her lover meets the husband in their home anticipating a home-cooked dinner gives a climatic   tension   that confronts the coupleâs double lives, questioning their make-beliefs against reality, and probably meant to insult our commonsense â  she loves him    and    her ? The complexity of  Toh Yi Ling 's life leaves us with no doubt that any sensible womyn would live better by   committing to one   world, specifically to one person: with man or with woman: to be congruent in heart, in mind and in any physical sense. Either way is no sweeping task.     Children   are believed to be fruits of love, only in the man-woman romantic framework. Womyn know children are also a heterosexist socio-cultural product. What then is the signature of love between two women? That enduring relationship needs a sustaining commitment, faith and effort from both is at most suggestive. As the story unfolds, the dynamics at play leaves us room aplenty to reconcile with the resisting, denying or uncompromising pressure from the majority, even if the majority made up our circle of loved ones and family.    To grow old together   , like any other couple does, is a simple wish, yet to fulfill it attests not only to the resilience of the relationship, but also the confidence of the individuals in living out their identities, however marginalized.   Toh Yi Ling âs sister,  Yi Lei âs multiple roles are representative of the other side. She was seen by  Yi Ling  as   the tool   of religious ostracism, the âbetter childâ, the conforming, the dutiful, the follower. Ironically, through her and cool-headed  Lesley  ( Yi Ling âs partner), homosexual relationship is demystified,   normalized   and asserted in its own right. And we were relieved and probably grateful as well, that  Yi Lei  gave her promise to a dying  Lesley  to give a protected space for  Yi Ling  to mourn for her death.   For the uninitiated, the play will always remain a play, following its closing scene. Those that are living and outliving this story, every day.. did they leave behind a wry smile at the theatre seats?  For me, " to grow old together ..." remains an unforseenable mystery in the future.   -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -  Official site:  urlLink http://www.toyfactory.org.sg/  ; Ticketing Information at  urlLink Sistic  .

      As if inviting to experience the peace in us and the harmonious relationship with nature, the movie begins with the resonance of   mu.yu  * and a wide angle view of the temple-in-lake. A breathtaking shoot of the scenery through spring, summer, fall and winter overtakes us not without harmonizing effect in our seats.  We flow with the story like an observer: the quiet story of a teacher and student, the story of deeds and repentance, the story of reconciliation and acceptance/awakening, the story of Life. We are at once tempted to view the world from the perspective of the old monk-teacher, and to silently reflect on how familiar the passion, pain, prayer and penance are in the young monkâs experience.  Reviewing the story with my personal experience will be the best gift I take with me after I left the theatre seat.    Spring    I was moved to tears several times in this short season. Because of the compassion of the elder monk, the young monk learnt a precious lesson about respecting all life forms. As much as he loves himself, the young monk learns that all life forms deserve a living space to live out their lives, as naturally and as harm-free as he wishes for himself. I cried as he cried in the film, fully agreeing to the teaching of the wise teacher: that with each act of harm we cause to others, we are going to carry the âstoneâ of guilt in our heart, til the day we die. Nothing can compensate a life lost. Nothing can compensate an act of malice.   I remembered when I was young and ignorant, I caused the death of a hatched chick. Till this day, I have never been able to forgive myself, despite many consolations and reminders from others that it was really not my fault. A life lost is a life lost; a life form struggling for life before it dies is a heartbreaking moment.   The wise teacher who patiently watched and designed a way to teach the student reminded me of the many ways my teachers have taught. I can never be more grateful. A wise and compassionate teacher nourishes your life spiritually like a mother selflessly provides for her child. The teacher knows he cannot hasten our learning nor cover up our deeds; and that learning comes from the natural law of life, he merely shows the way.    Summer    The season of passion and desire in the show. The struggle: to acknowledge the desire, accept and not act on it, or to let it runs into our hot blood and guides our actions. The way of the majority, we know. And with the season of fall, we know how sometimes we go through a big roundabout to learn and realize what we need to learn and realize.  It is juxtaposition in play, beautifully and seductively shot across the shrine hall and sleeping quarters. The elder monk was always sleeping soundly at night, in fact in all seasons, while the couple exchanged passionate (not to mention, lustful) glances across the serenity of the shrine hall.     Fall     The season of maturity: coming to accept the unsatisfactory nature of things in life, to come to a peaceful reconciliation of the guilt, the aversion, the feeling of injustice and betrayal that shook us out of our spiritual ease.  It is enlightening and comforting to see that the younger monk returned to seek the refuge in his childhood teacher and the place he felt most at home in himself. He returned with the Buddha statue, and the knife stained with the blood of his wife. He thought someone he loves, and whom also promises him love will be his to possess for a whole lifetime.  âOut of love, we kill.â What can be better mockery of our foolishness?  With deep aversion and sense of betrayal, he got rid of his loved one, and still having not able to rid his miserable mental state, he attempted to get rid of himself.  In the protected space that his teacher provided, he began to realize the root of his misery lies in his heart. As he carved out the Buddhist classic   Heart   sutra word by word, he diminished the fiery of unquenchable desire. For him, as well as for me, the fact that we are each inevitably responsible for our own actions is comforting and reassuring. True repentance comes from genuine acceptance of, and the courage to face, the consequences of our actions.  Each life born will come to an end. The elder monk demonstrated that it is possible to face life and death with equanimity. Might we think that the elder monk is also taking his own life? I choose to differ. He utilized natural resources to provide everything he needs to live, and when itâs time to die, he prepares his own funeral pyre. How many among us can truly   choose to live   and   choose to die   in the way that he did? Existentialist works proposes each being inherently has âthe freedom to chooseâ, but do not appear to provide a proposal of how this freedom can be fully exercised or actualized in our domain of existence.     Winter    Winter is often perceived to be the last of the four seasons, because we often forget that âseasonal cycleâ means there is no beginning and no end so to speak. Life rejuvenates itself after letting go of what needs to pass away. Hope nourishes itself after a new commitment to live better, wiser and happier.  As the younger monk returned to his home a second time, he is determined and clear of his purpose of return. And he is aware of his role in the temple-in-middle-of-lake, and his place in the ocean of existence, of truth. With this higher awareness, he felt empowered to pray for the welfare of all beings, exemplified by his placing a   Maitreya Bodhisattva   statue (Buddhist symbol of enlightened loving-kindness & joy) high on a peak that overseen his temple and the surrounding hills. He probably prayed that it would bless all descendants of his ancient temple. With the higher awareness, we also see that he felt more empowered to continue the journey of his teacher, in showing the way to Truth for those who come onto his path.    I rejoice in the production of this enlightening Korean work âSpring, Summer, Fall, Winter.. Springâ. It speaks a universal language that will continue to resound in the lives of many to come.    mu-yu æ¨ é±¼ : a buddhist ceremonial instrument that is used to count beat in chanting. has the symbolical function to call to awakening all those who hear it.. or to address audience to listen to precious teachings..           :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  View film website:  urlLink http://www.sonyclassics.com/spring/shell.html   View a Dharma-inspired movie review:  urlLink http://www.moonpointer.com/movies/spring.htm

        i hesitated a long while and i reflected on the past.  i deliberated to sum up my life with just a few neat headers.  the more i live, the more i lose -  my memories, identities and the tangible assets.  where there is nothing to begin with,  there is nothing that i will take with me  at the end of the journey.  i leave this as a legacy of my transient existence.        birth      and death.   born. 1978 on a december dusk. alexandra hospital. stayed in ang mo kio, so i was told. and then clementi, bukit batok and now further west.  cared for by several hands: maternal to paternal grandparents and to parents.  til i realise life is in my own hands. i lost my grandfather to cancer, and this started me questioning why.  why my grandfather had to die? and why do i need to die?      my schools.   i went through clementi town & princess elizabeth primary schools.  bukit batok sec and jurong junior college.  the last hurdle was NUS; i did philosophy and psychology.      birthdays.   at my 1st birthday, i looked at the cake and single candle.  i thought it was all so stupid and waste of time.  nobody else was paying attention to my 'party' and i wondered why my mother created all the fuss.  my mother did not believe i had not enjoyed my 1st birthday.  today i love the company of friends and family who made the effort to remember  and celebrate i had lived another 365 days  and to hope i'll live through another year to come.       darkest time of the day.    perhaps delivery of me was a painful process.  til now i would get gloomy every sunset.  the transition between day and night, it's kind of silent melancholy,  slow moving torment of the soul.       friends.    mentioning my friends. most come and go.  some stay a little longer. my life is moulded and shaped by them.      spiritual friends and mentors.    i suspected i have known them a long time ago. long before i was born.  deep down inside i know we run by the same engine:  the conviction in truth and liberation.  And a gentle loving-kindness to heal wounds along the way.       the love of my life.    many love, many attachments.       i wish.    i wish i am the little yellow flower on that green patch of grass.  there are many other similarly little yellow flowers around me  and we are blowing in the wind. with the vastness of sky and the vastness of field.       my teacher.    the Buddha.  reminding me i have a home to return to. awakening to work towards to.  and that there are many around me who share the same suffering and same aspiration.  that there are some refuges that are more reliable in leading me to the other shore.        my death.    inform my friends i am gone.  tell them not to cry for i leave with a silent hope and a quiet peace.  i am going home, to buddha, to my awakened state.  i may return in a different shape.  above all, place the ashes somewhere. remember me for a few years. forget it.

      Officially yet-to-be-employed for a month. Did some volunteering work during this break that enriched my life in a different way. How nice if we approach a job with a volunteer's selfless giving motivation. No-gain/loss-struggles, no-win/lose-conflicts, no-ugly-competitiveness. Simple joy from a simple heart. Pure sense of job satisfaction. Fully engaged in the moment in doing what needs to be done, wisely and kindly.  Zen art of living ?

       It.s twenty-ninth day of the fourth month of year twenty-O-four. The sun this day is not quite like the sun of previous day. The same nameless tree by the street outside my door is not grievin' over the departure of its many offsprings. Some of them left when they were yellow or brown. Some even took leave when they were still green. The good old tree. When the birdlings flap their wings, they are ready to fly. When the time is ripe, the fruit falls from the unknown sky. The sun this day will not be like the sun the following day.

      [Previous entry from fridae profile] ---------------------------------------------  Recalling my days since 11 Apr: there were sparks and i saw their diminishing. i witnessed rebirths and the dying of spirit.  the toil is fascinating, as it builds wisdom. amazing is the zeal to start all over; each time, it teaches us to be alive and be kind.  one fine day when the owner stops to build the house* there is no more dying and death  the spark is beauty in the moment and only in that moment.    ---- * Buddhist analogy of house-builder, as the creator of his own rebirth.

      piece of cake. can be further sliced. one person can't take all slices, it was meant for its many admirers. each one takes a piece, and continues to look on, look about n around.  piece of cake is neva savoured as just a piece of cake. its many tastes comes with its many slices. the lonesome piece of cake neva know its true taste.

      currently. trying workin out, sweating out keeping to moving about, doing things as the motions getting fast-paced, less and less mental space to do planning and reflecting   i used to exist, or able to justify my existence, only thro' reflecting what i have done, what i have not done, what needs to be done, what should have been done and whats not.   reaching a point i can't carry myself further in this long journey.. then mental barriers start breaking down and self-constructed perception and identities, others-projected images and expectations.. all starting to fall apart..   and tats where i am .

      in the company of people younger, sometimes we put on an old hat, to play an educator role, or to share what we have gone thro'. yet, we need to play with them like we missed it all out in our childhoods.  in the company of people older, we wear our little childish smiles, sometimes the obvious gap in age needs to be further emphasized, to encourage, to uplift. yet, we need to put on this mature front, to convince that, yes, mentally, emotionally and even spiritually, we have come this far..  at any age, there is this fluidity in our roles and how we relate. it puts us in the present, the past and our future. the imagination is limitless in time and space. likewise, the capacity of empathy.

      in the morning,just when i told myself i was not going to think about all these anymore. i got to see her at my working place. it really was an exciting surprise. i fluttered with increased adrenaline. my head was telling me, if i never talk to her now, it would be never. i had a feeling she recognised me. the verbal exchange was downright simple and trivial. it brought me only a little step forward in acknowledging each other's existence in an official context. but but... what is next? it made my day though and i was ... in happiness beyond words.   after work, i made a point to go down to her outlet, to have dinner before i joined my friends in JE Kbox. having spotted her inside... i went in to buy a drink, but she was nowhere in sight already. fine. at least the drink quenched my thirst.  she had a new haircut.. and turned her black hairs to a blond or yellow. i saw her close up, she is not radiating with charm as i imagined her in my dreams, but still, i only have eyes for her.   now at least she knows where i work, and i have made the first move to speak the few words. oh my, not forgetting the exchange of eyes. when will i see her again? and what should i say? ....... arggghhhh...     + + + + + + +  i joined my ex-colleagues for singing session at Kbox. while they all left by 12mn, i stayed sing alone til 2am. i wouldn't have done that in the past, but now that i did it, i did not think a big deal about it.   and i told miss piggy about what happened. i can't wait to share my excitement with someone who has an open mind to listen.

      Ref entry: Trapped Ego   i decided i will continue working as a part-timer there and i got to put my fav name on the 'team member' name tag. *beams*  i discovered as i put down all those egoistic statements and circular questionings, i was able to integrate myself into the job, the team, the environment. frankly as i learnt up what i needed to learn, so far, and caught up with the speed, i was enjoying myself. i love the speed, challenging myself to the fast pace, and to perfect the skills involved.   and i have more time to appreciate that colleagues are pretty wonderful people who care to teach me and help me out. they are also beautiful n simple people who are also enjoying and having lotsa fun at the job. after the 1st 3 days, i am having an easier time. i learnt to smile n relax while i be an octopus (really bz til u need more hands & legs). occasional chats with colleagues are fulfilling, simple topics, broken english (or shall i say, singlish), and most importantly, we talk genuinely... [interrupted by a fren's visit] ...  anyway.. the job makes me feels real & grounded. n a simple sense of fulfilment.   [interrupted: got to go for lunch. entry to be continued... ]    22May:   the point is. the entrapment does not come from outside. it lies in the structure we build for ourselves to feel secure and comfortable. the framework in our mental capacity for ourselves and others to have an easier or harder time understanding and be understood.   open the heart and mind! free ourselves from self-entrapment.

      18.05.04 :::  I flew kite on a friend. We were supposed to meet at HV so that i can pass her something. She travelled there from orchard, while i was late as i was in NUS Lib. She tag, saying she has a meeting later. And so i thought i can't make it there on time, and got on another bus who coincidentally stopped in front of me. Getting on the bus was tempting and inviting, since i was almost broken from the high temperature and heavy load in my bag (borrowed 5 thick books). The trip to HV was imaginably torturous, considering i had not eaten lunch, was very hungry, and at HV i had to take 2 buses home. And having high regard for efficiency, i figured it was not worth it jus to go down HV again (i travelled from HV to NUS) to pass her that some-thing.  Anyway the main issue was i flew kite and i think she got pissed. From her side, she really needed to get pissed. She did not reply my msg and i tot, no matter what reasons i had, they are just lame. And so i have not called her to apologise/explain.  On my note, i think i always felt f*** when she raised the matter about advising my current financial plans/insurance policies. Maybe this is the reason why i treated her so slightly. I never trust financial planners/advisers, insurance agents, and whatever shit. i hate talking discussing about my financial situation n insurance plans without harboring the thought that they are persuading me to buy n spend. u know what, u can't teach a hardship family about budgeting when they do not even earn enough for basic food. (that's what i learnt in prev job) AND that's the whole bloody similar issue with my financial status.  And my 1st stoopid agent having done with squeezing my CPF for some insurance/investment plan, disappeared from sight totally. NOW i don't even know what is happening to my account and what is the price and whether i should sell it or transfer to other plans OR WHAT!?!      AND FINE. whatever bad cross paths i had with these agents, the fact is i was wrong to fly that kite. And i got to give her a call when she cools down.

      In life, suffering is inevitable, but a little relief due to a human touch brings a cooling effect to the tortured heart.  It is often the suffering in one's heart that is most unbearable. Coz if we are strong enough in mind, we would use reason and understanding to transform it into wisdom, to a lesson about life. Yet, if we are not, then it is often felt as a helpless birdling wishing to fly with broken wings.  Suffering taking form in mental torture is excruciating. The losing of one's senses and sensibility. The sense of degradation of human pride due to insanity, felt by the individual. Not a full-time insanity, which may be a relief, gawd. But in reality, it is the moving in and out of senses that makes one at a loss.   Hence whether it is hallucination, delirium or morbidity (matters of the head), whether it is unfulfilled craving, wry hatred, persistent anguish (of heart), see them as illnesses inevitable in human condition, manifested in varying degrees in every individual.  The illnesses can be better recovered to equilibirum if we have nurses/ guardians. The compassionate nurse inside us: looking at ourselves kindly, patiently, with knowledge of the illnesses and of necessary medication. And also compassionate nurses in the support rendered to us, by our loved ones and those who are genuinely concerned.   I pray i can strengthen the nurse/guardian inside of me, to always give myself time, room, dedication and energy to heal, to grow. To the extent of effecting it to people around me.   I also pray i meet dedicated, loving and compassionate guardians who just make life and the earth a more comfortable place to live in.

      meanwhile, during these waking hours, i realised it is important for one to take passion in what one chooses in a career. probably b'cos of what my current manager told me, and b'cos of the trainer last nite. i recalled why i choose to be in the helping profession.   1, It gave me an one-to-one opportunity to be there for the client, with the client. The focussed attending. To relate to another with an open heart and mind, in that short time, without bringing myself in it (non-judgmental).     2, To journey with another human being, just as much as i know it's invaluable for me to have someone(s) other to journey with me. To overcome a difficult phase, to witness one's joys & down, to celebrate life.   3, To exercise creativity in drawing attention to & develop one's sense of total well-being, in the session, in the planning of programmes, etc.

      perhaps i had coffee too many last night, couldn't really sleep for whole nite.  the first time i rem having palpitation was less than a year back, in office. good to have a colleague who once worked in a cafe before and knows the condition. i only had a cup, after i returned from a retreat where i abstained from caffeine/coffee for 16 days. it was the first time then that i discovered how coffee can harm my body as i felt it. i m suffering from a mild palpitation now.  have not gone for a jog for some days. gonna do it since i can't sleep.

      One of the worst kind of feelings is to feel misfitted/ mismatched/ misplaced/ mislocated¡­ in one¡¯s environment. Not to mention the occasional odd crowded places where I happened to be in temporarily. Recently I actually chose to work in a F & B as a part-timer and never fail to feel the abovementioned emotions.   1st, fellow colleagues are much younger than me, lower educated, different race from me, different social positions from me (they are still schooling).   2nd, I do not understand how the work experience can substantially contribute to my professional development and personal character building and spiritual self-exploration.   3rd, I do not know how much longer I can last out down there, which made me all the more guilty as I do not want to just run away after going through training lessons.  4th, it makes no sense that given my earning power which is higher, I chose to dedicate time, energy, effort to a part-time job that earns me little more than what one gets in  McDonald¡¯s.   I keep asking myself, ¡®What am I doing down here!?!?¡¯  ¡®Where am I going from here!?!?¡¯  ¡®Is it an effective means to an end!?¡¯  ¡®Am I just taking a break or am I completely lost & getting my ego trapped!?¡¯    Frankly, I don rem I was any bit this lost in any part of my life. Will prayers help?

      I went through struggles of hesitation and confusion. Struggling with submitting to desires & impulses VS curbing them with rationality & practical projections.   I have always wanted to do Art since secondary school days. But many times I gave in to whatever that are deemed to be having more ¡°prospects.¡± All the way through tertiary level, the smooth passing of time and vocation diluted the contents of Art in my blood & life. I lose confidence and beginning to see Art in any perspectives but true appreciation. I felt I do not belong anywhere to this circle or category of living; the sense of seclusion and exclusiveness made the part of me, inside me, faded and died in old autumn. Do I want to continue grieving like any other beautiful tragedy?   Who can I seek for support and permissiveness, to spend another 3 years pursuing a diploma, paying course fees in full and at the age that I am in? Can I hold myself responsible for my decision? Will I have the courage to pull me through 3 years? Is it practical: economically, emotionally and spiritually?

      Went to a training programme and I was impressed with the presentation style of the speaker. She was natural and engaging. There were jokes and interaction with the trainees; at least she tried to engage with those unresponsive ones. But I thought she needed not share some of her wanton views based on her subjective experiences, which reflected, at least to me, that she is judgmental and unapproachable. Being the way I am, who does not like to complain too much, and especially to unnecessary ears, I found the session suffocating amidst/abeit cynical laughters.   I realized many people can be 'presentable' to a large audience, confident and self-righteous, but may not be easily relatable as an individual. They do not give others the sense of empathy and understanding.

      Over a simple meal just now with an ex-colleague, there are many things that have happened in me in relation to her. She is much my senior in life experience and in the profession that i used to be in. I was once attracted to her charm and that was yet another flush of lesbian ID confusion and sweetness at the same time. And then the spark, like all sparks, diminished. Reason comes into the foreground and i discovered a whole lot of similar attitudes towards life & living between us. I started to admire her character.   And soon it was over a simple dinner that we sat in front of each other chatting. But i found everything was different. I lost more than just the passion i used to hold in my profession, i lost the touch i once had with my ex-colleague.   It is amazing that a simple dinner has just traversed past grievances, present confusion and lost, and uncertain future.

      this is the 2nd time i enter my entries here. the previous one has been unsuccessful in archiving and hence i post the entries in my own website. going through many bloggers' sites make my heart itches again. and here i am.   i guess the essential thing about being alive, is to be witnessed as existing. i am not sure who will read my blog entries down here. seriously, reading thro' people's really-mundane thoughts, ideas, feelings and events are a torture sometimes. but still there are really mundane people who like reading about mundane affairs and feel involved in connecting with somebody who is real alive out there. i am one such human being.   anyway, i will continue to blog until somehow i stop.

      many frens told me to take my time, don jump into any job... on the premise that my savings can last..  my parents asked if i have been trying to find a job, n what am i trying to find. they offered help. so far they hv not pressure me: they have only asked less than 5 times in these 3 months. and i m sorta grateful.    then how come i m feeling all the pressure, from inside me.  i hv worked for a few yrs, i know my spending n saving habit. without income, u don truly feel yr independence.  sometimes how u hv been taught at home, educated in school, social moulding and the manpower, economics infrastructure creep deep down into u. n it manifests as part of yr ability to feel guilt. like an invisible knight with an invisible sword, formidable presence. like a prison warder preparing the hang-up for you, inevitable choice n the urgency.

      [1] received the thank-you reply from prisons. i hv mixed feelings about it. its not a great deal, considering the training bond n 2-yr bond after training. yet to get declined is always worse than declining ppl's offers. sucks.   [2] n i hv serious doubts abt continuing my part time job. it functions as an excuse for me, not able to concentrate on lookin n preparing for full time job. yes, i said its an excuse.   think abt it this way, with all the free time in the world, it is more obvious to myself n others that i shld get employed! but with alot of time in the world, but sometimes need to do part-time work, it seems i can jus live off like tat.   illusion.

      did some shifting around in my room, tho the mess n pile-up is still there.  now i m sitting on a proper chair to type, and the feeling is like, formal. high up hanging in the air. *i still sit crosslegged*  very different from when i used to sit on the floor, my tatami mat and cosy towel... and having the whole wide space on the floor as my table. i still sleep on the floor tho, n the whole wide space is my bed, shared by the pile of mess of cos.  every now n then, i will get bored of things ard stagnant, and i will create changes. new outlook.  guess my room reflects my person very well. n how i handle it reminds me how i m coping with my life.   bought a big black clock from IKEA on wed, with white numberings on it so clear n visible that i cant possibly lie about time.

      did abit of crying this morning. remarkedly i often think of buddha when i do, and so crying time is connection time with my spirit, my inner self, and with refuge and home. it gives me relief from tension inside of me,  like a ball of entangled threads-- confusing, messy, intricate, frustrating.  to move forward, no matter how hard, it starts with letting go of where we are, in order to take a step, different from where we find ourselves to be in presently, to accept changes, to brave thro' uncertainties.   let loose of the firm grip of  what we think we are, where we think we are in, where we think we should go, who we think we should be.

      i feel truly in suffering, when my gastric is wrecking trouble.. i thot i shld jus die.. countless times throughout these years, how much has it eaten into my mental & nervous system..irreversible... though after each havoc, physically i may recover to pink.   buddhism promises liberation from this physical body, if we try out its whole system of cultivation practices.. i always hope i can concentrate working on my own liberation.. but it is a fact that when the body brings pain, the mind brings suffering, it also brings sensual pleasure and mind-made happiness. arrggghhhh..... and precisely thats the point. its not that liberation n enlightenment are hard to achieve; i am not determined to take the 1st step, thats all.

      went to TCM hall, the lady physician looked kind and very soft-spoken. but the experience was not promising as i ended up telling her my symptoms, without hearing much from her about my health. as what others have done, she advised me to keep to regular diet, avoid food that will upset my digestive system. spicy stuff--> fine, i can reduce. coffee--> no way. n wat else.   whatever it is, the fee is expensive, considering TCM is meant to be longer-term treatments to eradicate the root of any illness (expected to spend more money). but one statement she made make alot of sense, which throw the ball back to my court. and that is, medication can help only 30%, the rest of it boils down to my diet, lifestyle, and how i look after my body.   inherently i trusted TCM alot, as i feel safe taking the herbalistic powder-form medication and the way the physicians listen to your pulse with their fingers attentively, mindfully. forget those gadgets in western clinics, they made me feel more like a patient than i really am. and the age-old saying that western med treats symptoms while TCM pulls the root out.   recent years after i take on psychology, buddhist practices, meditation, yoga and know about holistic healing, etc, i adore the system of treating one's physical body together with mental n emotional health. the mind is the forerunner of all actions, and it is certainly the creator of all ill-health.   when i was more diligent in my meditation practice, i got to a newer level of sensitivity towards physical elements in my body, my emotions and thoughts. and i see how the relationship works, to the extent that i feel empowered as i discovered preventive & curative measures to heal myself. this greater sense of awareness is no miracle, and nothing to hooha about. everyone can do just that, if we are willing to tune in to hear n give what our body, mind, spirit needs & wants.

      chanced upon this question on the net:   :: can u love me for who i am? ::  was thinking to myself, before i even pose this qn to anyone, can i find my answer to:  :: can i love myself for who i am? ::  ( i confess. i am trying very hard to work on this. and this is paramount to any other social achievements, or socially-constructed modals of achievements. )  and so the question should politically be correct as:   :: can you love me as much as i love myself ? ::

      went to kinokuniya todae (sunday). it was having its storewide 20% discount. bought a few books and cost me more than a hundred. did not get the sense of satisfaction cos i din have the luxury of time to peruse each appealing book and somehow, still did not got the books that quenched my thirst. i suspected all the good books were swept gone from the shelves by keen readers.   + + + + + + + + + +   Currently reading: * The Persistent Desire (a butch-femme reader) * The Very Inside (anthology of writing by Asian and Pacific Islander Lesbian & Bisexual Women) * Redefining the Self (Coming out as Lesbian) * The Essential Gandhi   must be wondering what has the last book got to do with the rest. answer is, it doesn't.   but it re-spurs my interest in the spiritual reading. tried to find something on St Francis of Assisi, and on Sufi mystic saints and Bhagavad Gita. none from Kino. think they should easily be borrowed from NLB.   more books and vcds lent to me from a fren. even more books left to rot on shelves, tables, chairs and where else.    +  + + + + + + ++ +  Currently still watching: ×ß Ïò ¹² ºÍ .  well, u really have to watch it patiently and mindfully cos it showed the whole drama of the declining episode in Ci Xi's time and the making of revolutionalists and their uprising. alot of wisdom, gained from silly mistakes and the essential transitions with the emergence of influential people, inventions and systems of thought.    + + + ++ + ++ + + +   what i need now is more book shelves and  plenty of time.. in my own world to create and recreate new ways of understanding reality and escaping it.   oh well. jus kidding.

      Vesak day is the most important day for me in a year, as it always brings back memories of the Buddhist teachers and friends i have known. Its a day i feel a stronger connection with the Triple Gems and that helps me reflect on my progress in spiritual practice. A day i recollect the scattered energy in my life, feels bliss, recharged with new hopes. Its like a new year day for me. : )   To all Buddhist and non-Buddhists alike, hope this day brings you bliss and strength. May  the progress in your spiritual path be successful according to your wish.        Happy happy Vesak!

      i was flipping through and repacking my stacks of photographs. my grandfather's photo was a black and white, the one that they used for funeral van. and there were stacks of colored ones, taken from 1997 to 2001.. with previous "BS arts clique"- all the bdae outings we organised, Buddhist camps/ events i attended, and the highest stack was the photos taken with graduation gown. it was a ridiculously high stack, crazy.  as i was taking them out, one by one, from the album and repacked them all into boxes with labels.. i felt like the past that i have gone thro' were also packed into the back of my mind, down the memory lane, into nice categories and labelled and shelved aside.   i told myself, if my room is on fire, the last thing i would think of bringing with me, wld be the photos.

      passing in n out consciousness these 2 days.. really cant imagine my physical state was so weak. i had a lot to sleep and seemed to be compensating for all the sleep i shld have but had not for eternity. neva experienced such mind state b4, neva as dazed and semi-conscious. shld i ring an alert bell? in a brief of a moment, i recalled the clearer state i had, during the times when i was still meditating. lucid and in control, confident n i could feel the strength of the mind. but alas. how much have i wreck myself to this extent.  the doc i visited on sat nite was also sick but i wondered if that shld excuse him for how he did diagnosis more like i m the doc telling him my symptoms, suspected to be cold, short of telling him what medication i needed. and the clinic asst is a sick fellow.. total lack of dedication to her job. hope its just tat nite, n its jus me who met her bullshits.

      a day i met several personalities from pl channel. went IKEA with R. finally get to see whole face of hers, haha.. as her pic at msn always shown parts of herself.  there we proceeded to catch up with M & Q. they are really cute n sweet gals, like younger sis to me.  and a few hi-byes with B, J, M, F, TY & J. wat a list. and F joined us jus before the movie; she really is like her pic. (private joke)   and yea, the movie. eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. featuring jim carrey n kate winslet as couple who went thro a procedure to erase their memory of the relsp. specially like the way it was shot, with scenes of jim carrey going thro sweeter memories of time spent with winslet, and running against time where he regretted n trying hard, in his mind, to preserve memories of winslet. even bringing themselves back to his childhood memories. the scriptwriter is a genius.   the concept was borrowed from the  cognitive neuropsychology.. good that i had a glimpse of it when i studied psy... so i appreciated that part of the movie: brain activities was encoded into computer system. external reminders in the environment (in this case, momentos, gifts) was used to reactivated all neuro pathways that was connected. and the treatment, was jus to erase all the pathways like u delete files in a harddisk.  though genius, its not possible task in reality.    was a shame, by time i finished the movie, my mind was already in a daze. (caught in a rain b4 the movie) couldnt really think, else i wld have appreciated the movie more. the show seemed to get F excited, she really loved the show... and she had a mouthful of analysis of it.. (F was the one who jio n bought tix for us).  guess one thing that struck me was,  tho the memories of a rlsp, or specifically, events that happened in the past can get erased, the natural tendencies one has still lingered on. eg. say i tend to be attracted to B-type people, and i fall for Miss B. even when i forgot all my interactions with Miss B, when i next meet her on a new occassions, i wld still be attracted to her, provided that personalities or any internal makeup in us did not change.

      that i have given up the precept* of abstaining from intoxicants like alcohol.i noticed the effects it has on clarity of mind.like mud in pure water, you see the color of mud and its impurities.if pure water has teeth, i would be the first she would bite, as she struggles to hold its fort and stainless purity.  there is no corner to hide my shame, should i be confronted by sensible Buddhists about practising non-harming. for there is nothing to talk about mindfulness practice which is the basis of all virtues, when the mind is rusty. as much as i can't abstain from alcohol, i try my best to limit the harm to my self.  so when i was asked if i would work in a pub selling alcohol to others, alarm in me rang to give a flat 'no'. the money seems easy and necessary, but i wont be able to forgive myself for serving mind-dulling concoctions.   ::::::::::::::::::::::::: * all Buddhists are advised to keep basic 5 precepts, of which the last one is about abstaining from taking intoxicants. the precepts form the foundation of virtuous conduct, from which concentration & mindfulness practice can give rise to compassion and wisdom.   the 5th precept aims to prevent committing misdeeds out of a moment of folly under the effects of excessive stimulants.

      i begin to think, those bloggers out there. do they blog what they want others to read, to know about them? or do they blog what is happening to them in their own perspective, how they read themselves, and how they want to believe about themselves?  the former creates a make-believe world, in which they find comfort in having some sense of control over what others are reading, hence knowing, about themselves. and the impression they are creating may or may not be close to the impression that they actually made in real life.  the latter creates a make-believe world in real-life, and reflects or documents it in the virtual. and probably to garness sense of control over what's happening to them in real life, through talking it out with themselves on virtual.   and of cos, there is no reality to speak of, at least i dont believe in it. the subjective reality that we conjured is everything that is within our human capacity to know. and the virtual and the so-called real life mutually influence each other, and in the gray zones, we seek for an objective truth that never exist. an objective truth that never exist cos both virtual & non-virtual planes are our creations.   and any creation is inevitably conditioned and subject to limitations.   and only what we make-it-up, we can know. for we cannot know what is non-existent. jus like if there is truly nothing, there is nothing to be known.   and the applicable points of this blabbering are:  - whatever you do, you are creating it; and you have limitless freedom to alter, to choose, to manoveur.   - whatever you do, you have no choice but to face the consequences of your actions. bcos all actions necessarily bring about some other actions or reactions in the manner of ripple-like effect.  - and it means, though you have all the freedom in the world to do whatever you want, you recognise that your actions will affect others, just as others' actions will affect you.   - and i deduce, if you want to live a happier life, it is wise to be considerate and make others happy too.

      wake up calls. ..in the morning to jog. ..look into classifieds to look for jobs. ..pause and take a good look into myself.  i have been hearing lotsa noise inside my brains.. i seem to lose the capacity to filter unwanted sounds from environment.. and to do traffic control in my brains about those thoughts of myriad strains.. the intensely felt desires, impulses and longings... and all others uncalled-for nagging notes..   if i continue like this, i will end up insane.  lifestyle and other habits in my daily life has not changed much. but how come i still feel everything is so complex, inside me!?!?   i lose the sensitivity n awareness i used to have. n why am i complaining it now, when i had intentionally wanted it to be so!?   either way, to be highly sensitive or to drown myself in my dark side, are bombing me with complex issues and emotions.   i thought, what if i am a sec 2 drop-out? what if i never make it in studies? what if the IQ tests define i have low IQ? .... will my mind & heart be simpler?

        Morning Breakfasts     Monday. ¶¹ ½¬ ÓÍ Ìõ was heavenly. Other dishes are fantastic too. I started to feel sorry for myself recalling the kopithiam near my house.   The HK uncle visited us again, brought us to a posh restaurant for dim sum breakfast. (after he knew we had b/fast, he still insisted to bring us there, cos he had not eaten his.) And i enjoyed it, really nice food.   the restaurant was filled with folks though it was only breakfast. it has become an old-folks gathering place, since the uncle explained retirees like him can take a slow breakfast, reading newspp n catching up with other folks.      concluding lines   BOOKS & BOOKSHOPS generally disappointed with myself as i hardly read chinese books, other than Buddhist titles. generally disappointed with low number of bookshops, and even lower number of english titles.   ON PLANE Tried Campari.  Dry Gin with soda.  Screwdriver.  red wine.    DUTY FREE shop back in SG Bought Rum and Bailey. 2 litres of alcohol, i can get intoxicated at the comfort of my home, lower cost and safe-from-rape (inside joke).    I LOVE HK. it gives me a good feeling where i was there. maybe its cos the city is vibrant, with mainly younger people on the streets. cos its so much like SG, except races there is not as diverse. i like the general confusion in the streets.   maybe i will get a chance to stay there for a longer period. by then i must master Cantonese.

        Sunday Morning with tour guide      gosh, guided by a language i hardly understand. nid to brush up my cantonese.  °ë É½ ¶¥ mid-of-THEpeak: HK skies are always a blur.   jewellery factory: prevented my mother from buying some stupid gold pendants.   Ç³ Ë® Íå Repulse Bay: there was a damn cool gal-- tanned, fit, broad shoulders, charming smile, bright-eyed-- driving a speed boat.  »Æ ´ó ÏÉ temple: devotees were praying so hard, but when i looked into inner-rooms of each 'µî court', i could not see what they are praying to. There was a gal in sleeveless basketball gear with spikey bleached hair. she was praying so hard i thot her wishes mus be urgent. she noticed my presence.     Sunday Lunch     We dropped by a small eating house, ordered ÐÇ ÖÞ Ã× ·Û . We concluded the servings in HK are generally very large. My lunch was generously sprayed with curry powder. My iced milk tea tasted unusual.      Sunday Noon: Shopping spree     Alot of time spent on MTR travelling due to the rain. We ended up at TIMES SQUARE, LANE CRAWFORD. The older folks, incl my younger bro, sat at a cafe, disinterested in walkin' anymore.   I hastily made my way to shop for VCDs.. and the PAGE ONE bookshop. Buying GLBT-themed materials was the main agenda for my trip and high on priority list. Good that i've done "my research" b4hand, there is truly a nice corner in the store with glbt-themed titles. It was probably also a 'cruising' spot, as mentioned over internet. As i busied myself cruising for books, there was however a les couple walking around holding hands. I thought, how sweet.  Spent HK500 on vcds n books. managed to buy  urlLink HO YUK  the movie which was the main one i was lookin out for. there were obviously more gays-films than les. (check out a "QUEER" logo on some vcds. cute.)  Gay-films, more at  urlLink GreenCinema.com   The shopping malls were filled with younger faces. I think even for women in their 30s n 40s, they looked younger than actual age. Most teens i saw were stylish, even if their dress sense was not as tasteful, their hairdos definitely were arty creations. Most copied J-pop.     Sunday Nightlife   Å® ÈË ½Ö back at Mong Kok. Nothing much to buy actually, but kept a keen eye on streetwalkers. Interesting.

      Over the weekends, June 5 to 7. @Royal Plaza Hotel, linked to Mong Kok KCR station (railway).    SAT noon @ THE PEAK     took ferry to Central. Tram up to peak. at ferry terminal, Fa-Lun Gong members are propaganding. feeling disturbed. got to know they are stationed at other prominent locations.      Sat nite: A BUS JOURNEY      was sitting alone by the window on this double-decked bus, from Central to Sha Tin... altho' placed in another part of the world, the mood is familiar.. .  lonesome melancholic existential disposition, overlooking at crowds n passerbys, dispassionate on the outside, burning with profound interest without effect.   beautiful. the lightings along the narrow streets,  rushing people, the bright-lit shopfronts, buses/trams screaming with speed and colorful ads. also beautiful is my feeling, at that time at that location.     Sat dinner      @ a 5-storey floating seafood restaurant in Sha Tin. i think it is a mad crowd. a classy oriental restaurant with a fishmarket ambience. the wedding banquet next door (half of the hall separated by a ping-feng) are playing classic canto opera while they yum-seng. some of us almost fainted.  out of 10 of us, only me am a vegetarian. out of 10 dishes, half are harmless veg. i can't helped feeling touched. i m doing my little bit for the animals that might have been laid on table.

      3 venerable monk & nuns are coming to SG, jus like last year, to lead meditation retreat, and other events. for me, cos they are only several years older than me, i tend to treat them as brother and sisters in the spiritual path. and more so cos we share the same fatherly shi fu who is our main teacher. expecting some sight seeing trips jus like last year, hope my stamina can last. due to the nature of their 'professions', the venerables seem to have better stamina and endurance than most of us, probably they have been running to and fro places back in malaysia to teach.  cos of their visit, i m trying hard to abstain from anything that will make me drowsy.. and of cos the hardest is alcohol. fren A jus jio me to go backstage todae and i have to be terribly disciplined and decline the prospect. for if i cant drink alcohol i would not want to waste time hangin out there. for if i drink tonite, i don think i can sharpen my mind as faster than a few more days..  one fren recently joked that since i get back to drinkin, the effects seem to have permanently damaged my brains.   and so next 2 weeks, i will try to behave myself, in every sense. in due respect for them, and most importantly, for myself.   ::::::::  on a side note, i think.feel.behave.interact differently when i am with diff social circles. but i am glad to reconcile some identity shocks in me, and i see that the double lives i have led since last year are coming to a merge, or if not, at least at ease. the overlapping grey area is getting clearer and larger.

      finally got the chance to jio a few willing frens to 'la' kopi at THAT coffeebean. went there on fridae and sun nite. but i din get to see her around, as usual. in a 'by-the-way' manner, i asked an unsuspecting staff if she is still working there.. and i was told she went back to M and wil be back next week.   i wish to chide myself hard for being .... silly? uselsss?  cos i was not properly employed for 3 mths now, and i still spend $$ on such high class coffee... mainly jus to catch a glimpse of her.... my fren would usu go for $1 kopi...  cos i gave in to my moodiness cos of her.. and spend some waking (& maybe even sleeping hours) making up and practisin lines to say to her if i really get to see her again....  :::::::::::::  jus finished this book at an unusual rate: sex, lies and stereotypes.. love kim ficera's sarcastic humour and sharp wit.. altho some articles are simply Ð¡ Ìâ ´ó ×÷ !!!  also watched Ho Yuk: i fell immediately in love with the character, Zero.  and When Night is Falling: some sensuous scenes. storyline is nothing impressive, altho the main character reminds me alittle about myself.

      this week. a week that passed away peacefully. like a tourist enjoying holiday, i was with them to Sentosa, Heritage Centre and other usual bookshops and places. Excellent restaurant-standard vegetarian meals, whether taken at restaurants or home-made.   Underwater World  .. erh.. i realise i need to take extra effort to be interested in fishes and water creatures. They seem fascinating, esp the jellyfishes.    Images of Singapore .. impressive.    Beaches .. with dogs, young bodies with tanned complexion, the vibrancy, the hot weather made u wan to join in the young people and their games.   Pink Dolphin lagoon ... woo.. can't help admiring the physique of the lady-trainers..stunning.. Not forgetting our pink dolphins, of cos', they complement the trainers very well. *lol*   Heritage Centre  exhibits made me wanna cry. Our ancestors had done so much to bring us what we enjoy this day. And its soo soo cheap. It's at Chinatown, i'll be back again.   this week was peaceful. cos with them, there is mutual respect, concern, kind intentions and joyous mood. No extremes of highs and lows. (of cos i'm not implying that without them around, we are not capable of all these good qualities!)

      that night, i walked thro the streets alongside with the pubs, bars, ktvs, etc. some are quiet with a few souls, some are heavy and smoky with loud music and chatters. the indulgences in sensual pleasure filled the air and engulfed the existences, they choke the souls. some are deliberate efforts, some are done without much self-awareness.   during that period, i belonged to the former. so i can't shirk all responsibilities and blame it all on drinks and self justifying. i know what i am doing, yet i know not.    :::::::::  had a drink at Backstage with a fren, chatting about the mental/emotional health of another fren.   passed by Tantric and we are even more mesmerised by the decor and ambience of the place. and not to forget, the polite endearing waiters.

      the retreat ended with a success. i m happy to gain back some of my sanity! during the retreat, tho' i was a busy helper running endless errands, i managed to steal time to do inner checking. it dawned on me how much i cherish sharpness and clarity of mind. grateful to the talks given by the venerables.   in midst of the actions and activities, inner space seems to come to a halt, and like a watcher of the night, i saw the mist and lethargy. apart from the lack of sleep that may have cause that, a large part comes from the previous intoxicating experiences that i willfully indulge in.   there is no regret; for if i have not gone that far, i won't realise what i lost was so precious. now, i do not know what to do with the 2 litres stored away in the kitchen. i have spent years gradually building up / uncovering / polishing the gem i already possessed, i do not dare to undo them again, even with a single drop.

      friday. i managed to sit in front of the pc to work for 4 hrs. thats cos i was doing a task that did not activate much brain cells.   then i went out to meet a fren and as usual, with this fren i talked and reflected a lot. come to think of it now, these years of talking with her seemed to be therapy sessions.   then i went to another fren's house to stay over. i was little surprised last nite that i moved around in her house as if i always knew what to do. perhaps i have grown accustomed to way things are every visit i am there all these years. perhaps its a changed me.  only difference is, she left me with no choice but to sleep on her bed for the 1st time. (and of cos, we were not sharing the same bed. *wink*) A good old springy bed. i have not met her mother in a long while, and while i had a short chat with her before sleep, i felt i have grown up.   did a little exercise in her house. drew what i envisioned myself to be in 3 years' time: a long laid back suntanning chair across the vast blue sky, sea and sand. these 3 melting into one another without clear defining boundariea and form the backdrop as a whole. and an awkward forest at a side. no sun, only 4 birds casually flying. it says about the kind of attitude that i still wish to hold. 3 years down the road, i still want to be as joyful as i am now, if not more.   the following morning, which is this morning, had a haircut that i almost fainted.. (okay. thats exaggerating.)

      a fren related to me about an unfortunate discovery: that someone we respect and trust has done some stupid deeds that put his reputation at stake. in the event, the betrayal of trust of all the people involved is almost heartbreaking.  as the matter is highly sensitive, we discussed at length how we should approach it. and the long conversation left a therapeutic effect, i hope, to this fren whose anger is reasonably justifiable.  i don know if i shld feel glad or not, that i have gone through similar feelings of broken trust and paranoia, expectations shattered, and whole deal of confusion and injustice. cos of past experience, i learnt and this time, i am able to accept what has happened with more composure.  there is nothing that is unforgivable. humans err. it just takes loads of time to heal, for memories to fade off and to rebuild the trust and respect again.   Cheers to the courageous ones who stay with themselves and allow this healing journey to flower.

      i had a frank discussion with the fren who recommended me to the current temp job i am holding. i will leave out the contents here. what makes me really grateful is how she has been showing her kindness, trust, thoughtfulness and patience in her modest way. and she is really accommodating towards me beyond words. and when i suspected if i am really competent to do what may be required of the job, without 2nd thought, she just took the extra mile to make me feel more confident. wow. like what she honestly says, its really my good karma. for if she has not go all way out to arrange things for me, i would never be in this job. won't even dream about it man.   and you know, at end of the day, seriously, i wouldn't care a damn about the job. i mean, i don't need that privileged job to define me, i am still who i am wherever i go. But what makes life really beautiful is how you meet such nice person and just feel all gratitude. its this that makes the difference in one's life.

       Casual Romantic  Sagittarian may plunge into a love affair whole-heartedly, but do not commit themselves too easily. They enjoy the chase of a new romance and often prefer casual relationships to something more permanent which denies them freedom.    The Chase  As the hunters of the zodiac, there is nothing Sagittarians like better than the thrill of the romantic chase. However, some of them lose interest once they have captured the heart of the person they have been pursuing, and will then set their sights on someone new. Although they often prefer to be footloose and fancy free, once involved in a relationship Sagittarians will make it as much fun and as enjoyable as possible.  Sagittarians are usually very gregarious people, but they gladly find the time for one important loving relationship. They are very warm and caring, although their light-heated affections may seem a bit too casual for some of the more passionate Sun signs, who prefer more security    Freedom  Independence is vital to Sagittarians, who can quickly start to feel trapped in a suffocating relationship. Some of them expect their partners to wait around while they pursue their own interests and their tendency to blow hot and cold can be very confusing. They usually possess suitably warm emotions and also a wonderful zest for life which is often filled with endless absorbing interests. Naturally optimistic, they will always tend to shrug off defeat.

      Sagittarians approach life on a grand scale, whether through their words, deeds or eating habits. They love excitement and adventure; and what they fear most is the prospect of being immobilized by illness. But constant restlessness drives them to use up enormous reserves of energy, endangering the mobility which they value so much.  A tendency to wing from the heights of unbounded enthusiasm, to deep depression may also often appear out of proportion to the events that triggered such emotions; but like the other Fire signs, Sagittarians do not take kindly to advice about their health habits.     Binges  As if to test their fate, Sagittarians will sometimes dull their mental torture in heavy bouts of eating or drinking. If this becomes a habit, those areas most vulnerable in the Sagittarian anatomy - liver, hips and thighs - may well suffer.  The most important thing for them to do is to temper their exuberant nature with some rest and relaxation.    Health Worries  In this respect, they are their own worst enemies while they may ,make light of personal worried and ailments, there is often hidden anxiety about health and the secret fear that one day luck may run out.

       The Bright Side  Sagittarians have an open-minded and intellectual curiosity which means that they are willing to learn about other people in an effort to understand them, and to be trusting and open with them in return. Sagittarians say exactly what they mean with devastating frankness.  Sagittarius is an optimistic, out-going and adaptable Fire sign. Sagittarian personalities seek to interact spontaneously  with life as they go on their great quest for meaning. Sagittarians also need a great deal of freedom and are equally willing to offer  that freedom to others.     Traveler  Sagittarius is a great traveler and adventurer and not only physically but in the mind. It is a sign that simply has to know the answers to life's big questions. Although they are as pleasant as could be when these answers are discovered, frustrating their quest could produce sparks.     The Dark Side  Tactlessness, boastfulness and thinking with one's mouth are Sagittarian faults which tend to upset other people. And so, too does a Sagittarian tendency to moralize and 'preach' what other people should do - without of course following the rules themselves.    Loyalties  One of the great Sagittarian difficulties lies in relationships. They find it extremely easy to be entirely faithful to two people at once. And bored Sagittarians are a danger to themselves and others. Anything goes, is their attitude, so long as it is found to be stimulating. This tendency to over-indulge can lead them to burn the candle at both ends and health may suffer.

      A friend, upon reaching a point where she could not face her environment anymore, resorts to leave the country. Yet without the courage to do it alone, she finds means to pull others along. In her desperation to find a satisfactory environment outside of herself, I wonder which corner in the world can she feel safe and happy. Where is her happiness to be found?  Maybe a relief from her current predicament will bring her happiness. Or maybe she is closing a chapter of her sad story to start yet another.    I am extremely disturbed to witness how she traps herself in her suffering, by hanging on to self-fulfilment, self-convincing, self-justification and dismissing what other alternatives others can offer her. After these years, i did not see her in any better shape that she wishes to, while i learn to close my eyes and shut my ears when she continues to whine and sigh.  I am worse tortured when she contemplates going out of the country where i see it potentially bringing her more confusion and insecurities than she already has.   I am indignant that she does not know how to exercise the freedom that is readily in her hands. She does not know her right to live, and that is, to be happy.

      in the journey of finding son, Marlin learns to trust the process of exploration, of taking risk, of trying, and of letting go. the important lesson of trusting the one he loves most; Marlin finds new meaning in his love for son: the love that breaks free from his over-protectiveness and insecurities, the love that gives his son space to grow, and the love that allows his love for his son to expand in depth.   though it is a story of father and son, it is truly the story about many of our relationships.   we often find ourselves taking on new journeys in search of more happiness and relief from unpleasant memories. yet often enough, we forgot that we are bagging along our old habits and mindsets, that repeatedly set us on the move. until we learn to let go of the ineffective patterns, we never truly reach the point of being at ease, accepting and secure-- where we are, what we are doing, who we are with.

      it has not occurred to the fren whom i recommended into the job, that this project is urgent. Probably, she knew it is urgent, yet with a complete disregard and lack of professionalism, she informed that she is going to take leave to be away for 10 days, for an activity she spontaneously decided this morning.    the employer has taken pain to train her free of charge, modifying whatever job schedule to match her learning pace. she has also emphasized that this period is crucial for our learning and getting us competent for the project. she has provided every convenience as best as she could to assist us in our learning and work.   it is heaven magnanimity that the employer responded calmly that she will try to arrange things in lieu of this abrupt news. she can actually choose to terminate the working relationship with equal cordiality, and promptly find someone to replace my fren.   i am totally ashamed. i withheld my harsher tone and politely chided her to reflect on the implications of her decision. Seeing her apparent defenses and self-righteousness, i can only secretly hope that in the midst of her private space, my fren can spare a moment to check her work attitude, motivation and professionalism.

      i felt a pinch in the heart at seeing my wallet burnt with a hole just for late return of library books and the loan fine of $25.   it could have seen me through a play that i have regrettably chosen to give a miss in order to save the money for more worthy cause  and it ended up paying for nothing but a lesson about punctuality    PS. yes, "sea-wheel", if u r reading this, you shld let out a good laugh! : P

      i think i cannot survive for 3 mths in this current temp job. its really ...... !!!!!  i seriously still do not know where i will proceed to next. whether i leave the job now (which i can't, out of moral and social obligations) or 3 mths later (when the project ends).   a fren looked at my face (face reading) and predicted i may lead a life with different vocations. as much as its in my blood where i have diverse interests and hesitant about devoting wholeheartedly to any one YET, this facet of my personality is gonna be reflected in my working life. and yes, her "predictions" may come true.

      To be really in the present:  DON believe what i published in this blog.  The end results, which is what get published, is what remained after a process of mental and emotional exposition exercises: The contents/ concerns about what's published truly belonged to the past.   The value of blogging (as it mattered to me) lies in the process, in getting what is in my system in real life out.   Like the stars we see out there in the dark. Admire them. hate them. just don't believe them cos they lived and happened light years ago.

      someone wrote this on the net, which captured my feelings these few days: "I miss you... there is no other way to say it... and i can't deny it... "   every image of u in mind, every word you've said that circled in my ears, every now & then wondering what u r doing at yr side, every anticipation of contact with you, every skip of a heartbeat... are summed up neatly in this straight confession of the heart. right in the face, nowhere to hide.  we can replace the first three words with any other emotion; but nothing beats the sweet suffering of this longing: missing someone.

      my hair is so short. if only i dare to drag as a boy. then i wld walk into gents with bold steps, altho i wld hate every min inside.  a few times, i have been called by aunties on the streets, supermarkets, etc. and they have to correct themselves after i turned over to look at them. i sympathise with their lightning-like brief gender surprise, while i struggle to figure whether i should laugh or be offended. i show neither.  i don believe in gender norms. like any social conditioning and learned behavior, these lazy schema/scripts subject people to restrictions and be delusional about who they really are, how they really like to appear, what they really want to do. of cos, there are people who need these rules to give their life more structure. and well, anyone can use them to their own good, but i beg not to take these norms for granted, or as absolute truths and get all judgmental. it is plainly, rude.

      i loathe this hour of the day  when the setting of the sun abduct every cheer and vibrancy out from my space  where the working crowd leave their office in dreary boots, hurrying themselves into public cabins to be squeezed like dry oranges.  and the perspiring children gabbling nonstop along the pedestrian walkways, with bags too heavy on their own or some nurturing shoulders, crashing into passing passengers with their needless speed and recklessness.  i detest this hour of the day where the light is failing and you hesitate to switch on the lamps cos it is still bright on the outside of windows  i abhor this hour of the day cos of everything that needs to happen at this hour that makes me depressed or irritable or depressed & irritable.  i accredit this senseless hatred to the unimaginable experience i had 25 years ago:  where i struggled in terror discomfort in my mother's womb at these hours of the day, and probably having a tortured time finding my way out onto this world at 19:35. i screamed to the brink of my soul with a mother sighing in relief.

      stayed out last nite at a senior's place.. talking to her seems more like mentor-mentee. admired her colorful young adult's life where she travelled (to date) 14 countries backpacking. and how she formed her aspiration by 20 y.o. and gone all way out to achieve her goals, unwavering. i admired her dedication to what she wishes to do.   people having personality like me can only stand aside and admire.  she asked if i thought of going somewhere else to stay, probably when i retire. to my surprise, i replied that i have no plan to go anywhere, no desire to. i told her, wherever i go, i bring myself along, so anywhere is the same. so i will stand around and watch my Ôì »¯ ... :P

      cleared up some concepts and expectations with my 'boss' todae. at least i don't feel as demoralised.  was actually looking up and reading on "design-based learning". these days these big terms "pedagogy" "multiliteracies" ETC ETC... blow my mind off abit.   no matter what i am still feeling blessed in this current job.   -  O  -  O  -  O -  O  -  O  -  O  -   my ex-colleague is pregnant in her 2nd trimester.. and we are all very happy and excited for her. as i heard her describe her discomforts.. oh my! i really think mothers are very very noble... and i really think i can't be that noble. phew!   encouraged her to keep optimistic, so that her baby will come out a happy and cheerful child!   -  O  -  O  -  O -  O  -  O  -  O  -  had dinner with a bunch of people. we talked about the disappointing mistake a person we respect did to some of us (see previous entry). as the 'victims' described in details what happened, there is a form of support and bonding between us. i am glad they took it so coolly and maturely. cheers to their magnanimous hearts!

      yippie... went sailing with a fren. she was the one who controlled the 'hem' and did all the necessary.  fren had some difficulties at setting out and settling in at the shore. and struggling with the 'obstacles' (floating balls and parked powerboats)..  and i, lazed in the piko hearing the gentle crashes of waves, watching the changes of clouds, making little comments about other 'olympus', 'laser', 'windsurf', 'powerboats'..  an afternoon leaving all behind at the shores.. its close to meditative..  but.. still not satisfied with having done nothing.. i jumped into the sea and swim holding on to a rope from the pico..fun!fun!  the life jacket apparently worked.  ( m glad i had snorkelling experience in the deep sea years back when i was at P.Redang. )    it was a nice weather, some wind that did not bring storms! something my fren was afraid of, probably she brought a first-timer on board...she's afraid that i am afraid bah.. : P   after this trip, i guess i am quite ready to face a storm that wld throw me off board...    ::::::::::     then went to esplanade with another fren, enjoyed the live performance of jazzi music. everywhere i go in the weekends there are plenty of foreign visitors, "temporary stayers" and small families. no wonder an article read 'a home that's beginning not to feel like home' for local singaporeans.  by midnight, i began to feel really drained. guess its due to the working weekdays + a day of doing nothing but talking and making chats.. introverts should learn to conserve energy by talking less and thinking unnecessary thoughts.

      very fulfilling!  finally finished a 1000-word essay trying to weave the concepts and ideas that i have read and generated for past few days... weeks!?!?! oh my! i hate to think i am so damn slow-witted.. but then the materials and concepts are something really really new to me wat!!!   actually i have not really integrated the worst, the 'cheemest' part of my reading materials into the essay...!!&nbsp; : (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  *sobs*   but its a wonderment that despite all the blows to self-esteem,  i am still thirsty for the readings & knowledge,  like a hungry ghost.   have been working from home&nbsp;these 3 days,  time flew in a blink of an eyelid,  and i am fully absorbed in this enclosed world of&nbsp;articles and ideas...   except for the intermittent distracting thoughts  which drove me nearly haywired  am glad i picked up new strength and awareness to curb them   wish me luck in this battle.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;

      when i think of a person,  i am interacting with the images and other forms of memories in my mind. it is a common delusion where we believe we are passively recollecting the past, without any new input from us.   in fact, in the process of thinking, emotions are aroused and the intensity of it varies from what i really felt when the actual event happened.   so when i re-experience the flux of emotions, the changes in my emotions influence how i interpret the past event and at the moment of recollection, i am creating new experiences (i.e. new signals to the brains).&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;  and it is significant to note that these new experiences are created without the presence of the object (in this case, the actual person i am thinking of), and henceforth without the interference from the object of thought. (i.e. the person is not present in action)   &nbsp;  with these in mind, let us look at the observations we commonly made in our daily lives:   1. the more i think of what she did to me, the angrier i become. the thought of her makes my blood boils. i think she is really my sworn enemy from past life.   2. she has not called me for a long time, i am missing her terribly. i am becoming to like her more with each passing day.&nbsp;   &nbsp;    the above examples may not be generalised across everyone, yet they are not unique experiences.       A&nbsp;linear, simplified representation of what is happening here&nbsp;:     A past event&nbsp;   -->    memories of the event&nbsp;&nbsp;   -->    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   arousal of new emotions or change in intensity of old emotions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   -->    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   re-interpretation of the past event or the relationship (with the object)&nbsp;   -->    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   (may lead to reactive action or behavior by subject)   -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -   &nbsp;   this is one way i understand cause-effect in the psycho-cognitive sense.   &nbsp;  (PS,  my old sister , if u are reading this, the above is one aspect of how i understand Buddhist concept of karma and rebirth.)   &nbsp;  without the presence of an interfering object/person, we can regenerate new memories and experiences. is this called 'dreaming'? if most of our experiences or neural inputs are not based on actual events in reality, how much truth can we swear to know?   if we can intuitively know and stop the process of creating this surreal plane of cognition, we will reduce the amount of pain, hurts, suffering, disappointments that are really imagined and unnecessary.   (of cos, we can argue insodoing, it consequently reduce our imagined sense of pleasure and happiness too.)   but perhaps, bringing our experiences closer to truth is a safer route to peace and security. doesn't this secures us with more predictability and consistency in our perception of self and others?  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      &nbsp; spent several hours ironing my clothes and changed my wardrobe to the set of casual wears.. and the prettier skirts and dresses were folded and tucked neatly in another shelf.   there were mainly 3 categories of clothing: A. casual wear, make up of polo-tees, t-shirts, jeans and drawstring pants, wearing them even to the current workplace; B. extra-casual wear, where i wear most to retreats or sporty activities; C. the more formal ones, which happened to be more feminine, and most were bought in the past 2 years while i worked. The  miscellaneous are the ones ready for donation.   hope i do not need to top up category C, and even better, need not touch them again... wearing them made me especially self-conscious everytime.   &nbsp; ÎÒ Ïë ,³ö ¼Ò É® ÖÚ ¾Í Ö» ÓÐ Ò» ÖÖ ¿î Ê½ ºÍ ÑÕ É« µÄ É®  ·þ, Èç ¹û ÓÐ Ò» Ìì ÎÒ Õæ ³ö ¼Ò ÁË , »á ÉÙ ÁË ·³ ÄÕ ,»¹  ÊÇ »á Îª ÎÞ Îª µÄ ÐÎ ±í Ôö Ìí ·³ ÄÕ ?

      Was reading this book by Viktor Frankl " Man's Search for Meaning". this psychiatrist/ psychotherapist re-inspired my search for the purpose/ the meaning or value of my life.   :::: read  urlLink short biography  of Viktor E. Frankl :::::::::: &nbsp; while i was&nbsp;reading the chapter on his recollections of the days he spent in concentration camps,&nbsp;i was reminded of "the schindler's list' the movie and immediately recalled the apathy and&nbsp;lacking-in-reactions i experienced as i watched it as a teen. i couldn't comprehend what the people in that black-white show were going through. especially the scene where women and men, old and young, were lining up in full nakedness for their rations/numbers, while the officers are fully clothed in smart uniforms and commanding presence.  &nbsp; he&nbsp;mentioned that&nbsp;when humans are faced with extreme or abnormal forms of suffering and torture, whether upon oneself or others, they responded with an abnormal reaction -- apathy.  (exact citation to be quoted)   and i am going through this abnormal reaction in my current situation, ever since i resigned from my prev job. not to the extent of utter apathy, but a deep subtle dread and withdrawal reflex from any source of intense (negative) emotion. or an emerging blockade upon any hint of intense attachment. i jus feel terribly drained.  &nbsp; i couldnt really comprehend and cant do much about it... contented about jus leaving it to recuperate..  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      &nbsp; i encountered some difficulty now that one close fren is back from her contract job of 2 yrs.. while i have great impulse to tell her everything about myself that has happened, i held back this part about my identity..   in a simplistic sense, what she is going thro' in life now is on the opp direction from mine... we kinda agree on that.. that makes me more hesitant to confide as i am really not sure how much she will understand, accept or react.  and i wonder, whats the point of telling her about all this...??? being the kind of person that i am, holding high regard for transparency among close friends, somewhat i need to tell her... friends are at the very minimal witnesses to our life events arent they !?   &nbsp;X-X-X-  &nbsp; i told her i will tell her on coming monday.. now that another kaypo fren confronted me about it in the face, in front of this fren... i jus cant find the words to begin this topic... and anyway, giving what i am going thro now, theres really nothing much to tell..  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      recently as much as i got a hold on frens' hps with cam features and frens' digicams, i would automatically capture a few shots of my-self from different angles at different parts. i was enjoying the whole process of creating and collecting these portraitures until it dawns on me about becoming overboard with self-obsession or ×Ô Áµ .. (*lol)   i wanna make a statement of self-defence down here ya. as a person who hardly looks into mirrors more than twice a day, who keeps no reflective gadgets in her own room (not to mention mirror), who only checks herself in public mirrors once in a blue moon, one has to come a long way to define how this person can be categorised to be self-obsessed in her physical appearance.   yet she is definitely self-centred in every other sense as much as she is 24/7 conscious and/or semi-conscious of herself inevitably. necessarily self-centred also cos she has not managed to place her core of consciousness and anchor on 'the-other' (be it  - an omnipotent omniscient figure,  - 'highly' powerful sedatives or consciousness-altering drugs,  - any intelletually fulfilling discourses and methods of thinking,  - any transcendental or spiritually seductive therapies,  - blinding love and lust concoctions and the object of these blind-effects )       the point is, on the contrary of thinking that this person must have intimately known every part and facet of herself after all these seemingly self-attention, she finds it more and more fascinating that there is always a strange (read: unfamiliar) reflection or image out there every time she captures it with a camera. that is to say, she is becoming to feel that she has never known herself at any point in her life before.   putting herself as an object for scrutiny, this poor girl freezes every dimension of herself inside outside&nbsp; and leaves the work to the eyes. she is reading herself every time with new eyes. whence has she ever known this being who has lived with her the moment she is born?   and this fascination and self-ignorance should continue until there is no more knowledge to be known. probably the day she breathes her last, she will surrender this thirst for self-recognition, self-understanding, self-identification, self-assertion and self-acceptance. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

(what breaks my heart subtly are those kids with specs heavy on their tiny nose, undistractedly absorbed in their own books...)   ´Ó ±ð µÄ Ð¡ º¢ Éí ÉÏ , ÎÒ ¿´ µ½ Í¯ Äê , ²» Ò» Ñù µÄ Í¯ Äê ¡£ Some things never change when we allow the kids the spacious room to express their spontaneity and creativity; but sadly some things change when parents want their kids to grow up faster.    watching the children, i see a world that has no time. purely staying in the present. like a capsule floating in a world of change. i form part of their world by being an observer, and celebrating in delight their joys of fresh learning. through them, i am invited to the part of me that has been lost in time, that needs a warm hug, a re-connection, and perhaps even a reconciliation. a part of me was also lost following the death of my grandfather, he had probably taken that memory with him.    growing up is a painful process. in the endless cycle of birth, i must be tired...

      isn't this wonderful news? considering that homosexuality is still considered an illness in Psychological definitions in the 80s(?) or 70(?)...   -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -   Psychologists Back Gay Marriage by The Associated Press   urlLink http://www.365gay.com/newscon04/07/072904apaMarr.htm      (Honolulu, Hawaii)&nbsp; The nation's largest association of psychologists is backing same-sex marriage. The American Psychological Association's Council of Representatives made its support official Wednesday, the first day of the group's annual convention in Waikiki. The council also expressed opposition to discrimination against lesbian and gay parents.  It also found same-sex and heterosexual couples remarkably similar, and parenting effectiveness and children's psychological well-being unrelated to parental sexual orientation.   The positions, drawn up by the APA Working Group on Same-Sex Families and Relationships, are meant to guide psychologists in the public debate over civil marriage for same-sex couples.   "In the context of the huge social and political debate that is currently going on, APA and psychologists had to grapple with the issue of what psychology believes is in the public interest in this controversy," said Armand R. Cerbone, a Chicago psychologist who chaired the working group.   The seven-member working group based its recommendations on research into same-sex relationships and families.  The Washington-based APA has more than 150,000 members, including researchers, educators, clinicians, consultants and students.    &nbsp;

      &nbsp; think my boss is compassionate enough to make me feel useful by doing hands-on tasks it may not be in her intention of cos but result is the same  got to speak to the new younger-than-me colleague finally today, after my absence from office for nearly a whole week. she is friendly and easy-going... not as unapproachable as she first appeared to be. probably has settled down more comfortably in the job.   im missing my friend-colleague's presence, the one whom i introduced to the job and then applied for long absence soon after. she is very cool in her work and attitude twds life, and in office, a reassuring presence. and she's gonna be back next week.. hopefully she wont throw a bomb to say she gonna quit (which is 50% possible!). so unpredictable of her&nbsp;decisions that almost anything from her is  sort-of  expected!!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      &nbsp; [1] watched the movie "The Dreamers" last nite. it was horrifying with too much sexual content. but if one places less focus there (which might require shutting an eye 80% of the time), there are several significant themes worth contemplating.   read my humble review at:  urlLink Ashes on fringe &nbsp;!   and ha! surprised that i was not asked for identification papers when i bought the tickets, but was still checked at the entrance. the one who sold me the tickets are much younger, and&nbsp;it's an&nbsp;uncle at entrance. he asked about my age and tho not convinced, he still allowed me in.&nbsp;the fren who was with me was my age too but was not asked.&nbsp;  -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -   [2] met&nbsp;this&nbsp;fren&nbsp;for the first time without knowing beforehand how she looks like and her name. and&nbsp;only after a few&nbsp;email correspondence.&nbsp;hmm.. its hard not to have real anxiety before the moment she appeared.  &nbsp; -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -   [3] had my first taste of riding a very cool silver-black motorbike last nite. ok, i'm not the rider of cos, but i am very sure its more fun in the front seat than at the back. its&nbsp;a memorable experience though. fun. exciting.&nbsp; and was wondering if i shld&nbsp;take&nbsp;up the licence.   &nbsp;

      &nbsp; can feel my bout of depressive moods on the return. following the onslaught of confusion. tension. doubts. low self-worth. disillusionments. indecisiveness. differing views & opinions offered by friends. aloneness in my experience and feeling that no one really understand. and having to be extra sensitive to the feelings and positions of different people with different events happening.   and increased sense of financial insecurity.. also contributed to all these i guess.   gawd. until i discovered i have mild headache over the weekends. and slept more than is required and usual of me. (i rarely&nbsp;suffer headache; so when i have, it spells my life is taking on its toil.)

      Hour 2235. i was sitting at the backbench of my bus home, looking straight along the walkway and vision spilled onto the road lighted in orange. it is an image of familiarity. bus was moving in regular momentum... i was in trance-like state. the girl next to me was a malay, but it din raise my cultural indifference. despite the blackness at the backdrop, despite that the bus was moving along past cemetries, i recalled safety. a sense of faith. the bus has never failed to bring me home. and that is the fruit of our nation-building.

      sometimes distracting ourselves to physical activities help. did some workout. kept my mind off abit. decided to keep to a more disciplined lifestyle, which its one of the long standing annual resolutions.  consolated that i volunteerily did sorta regular workout (incl. joggin'). probably out of vanity. i m getting older, and it shows in the physical form.  another aspect to change: will start to sleep early.   one reason to live: for the sake of my self. cheers.

       Monday  is an eventful day, filled with moments of ..... Wonder if its the effect of the tea i drank at night, or ....... i couldn't sleep the whole night.    Tuesday  Early morning. I sat in for a 'dialogue' among the creme of the crowd in education/psychology field. (my boss commented it's more like a monologue..opps!) The speaker presented on a brief cultural-historical background of Activity Theory. He increased my curiosity about this great mind of Vygotsky. All else sounded very cheem cos he spoke in assumption that we know about Activity Theory. There are a few in the room who asked some interesting but equally cheem questions. Among things i don't know, i know their questions are of great repercussion and scope if effected in practice.   Tried very hard to concentrate in this 2-hr session, despite a serious lack of sleep and a whole lot of distracting thoughts & feelings.  Din know some things can actually affect my appetite despite hunger pangs. Felt sick, I couldn't make it through the working hours and have to come home early to sleep.

      as i was writing the review of the play: Mergers and Wills, i discovered there are many issues, difficult issues, that underlie homosexual relationships that are subtly and explicitly defiantly explored in the context of the play. but the short duration does not allow its messages to be constructed objectively. the play ended with me feeling  challenged and having lotsa doubts. the play cannot provide answers nor able to resolve the issues it raised. it may not be the intention of the playwright. but it does seem a sincere attempt to convey that resilience of the lesbian relsp, an united couple, can overcome all discriminatory or misunderstood pressures from their heterosexual social community.  -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -  O  -  review IS OUT at  urlLink ashes on fringes  .
