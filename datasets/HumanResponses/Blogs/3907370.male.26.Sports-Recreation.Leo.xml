              The Major League Baseball All Star Game was on last night, and after much pomp and circumstance, there was actually a game, and it did not end in a tie.  I got busy last night and lost track of time.  Coverage of the game started at 8:00pm.  I turned on the TV at 8:45 and they were still doing player introductions. I must give MLB credit here having the players come from the stands, across the top of the dugout and down to the field was a great idea.  Probably the only good idea MLB has had regarding the All Star Game in many years.  One question though, do pro baseball players think, "God, I hope I don't fall down these steps in front of everyone," just like the rest of us would. After player intros came the first pitch ceremony, which include Mohammad Ali, who gave us all a show by boxing the camera and Derek Jeter.  Then came the longest national anthem in recorded history, and at one point it look like the girl was actually in severe pain and collapsing like she popped a lung or something.  After all of this, I don't even know what time the game actually started, but I am guessing around nine o'clock.  This makes me wonder, if the All Star Game is an exhibition for the fans, why does it start so late that most fans went to bed long before the end of the game some time around 11:15pm.  Now I know the argument is that if it starts earlier the people on the West coast don't get home in time to see the game, and that may be true, but since it starts so late on the East coast, people here miss the end of the game. Here is an idea start all of the extra stuff and 7pm that way the game actually starts at 8pm and most of the country can see the end while people on the West Coast only miss an inning maybe two.  Now this is all if based on the premise that the All Star Game is an exhibition for the fans.  The problem is MLB cannot decide what they want the All Star Game to be.  They try to make it fan friendly by letting the fans vote for the starting line-up, but to make it more interesting they attached some value to the game by giving the winner home field advantage in the World Series.  This makes sense how?  In most leagues the team with the best overall record gets home field advantage, but not in baseball. In baseball home field advantage is decided by an exhibition game in which people outside of baseball select the starting line-up, and players from every team are represented.  If MLB wants a fan friendly exhibition don't attach it to home field advantage in the World Series. Let the vans vote for whom ever the wish, but show it at a decent hour.  If you want to make it a more meaningful game and give it meaningful importance like deciding which team get last licks in Game 7 of the World Series, then you need to make other changes.  If this game means something then the manager of each team needs to be able to pick the best team they feel is available.  The fans usually do a good job of voting, but occasionally a player gets to start that shouldn't.  This year's example is Jason Giambi.  Jason, while a good player is having and unusually bad year, has spent time on the DL, and in general is not putting up All Star quality numbers, yet the fans voted him to start.  Another change that should be made if "this time it counts," is the unwritten rule where everyone has to play, you mean to tell me that if we were playing a real meaningful game with last nights rosters any manager in MLB would ever pull Sosa and Bonds out of a game after two at bats each, no way in hell.  If this game meant something Bonds and Sosa both would have played the whole game, and you would never pull a guy who is used to starting after one inning in which he retires the side in order with two strikes, like happened several times last night.  The bottom line is if the game is an exhibition leave it as an exhibition, one game AL v. NL, don't attach a post implications to the game.  If you want the game to have meaning then it has to be played and run like a meaningful game.  Having it both ways is just plain stupid.  That is just one guy's opinion!

            When has loyalty to your political party gone too far?  When it causes you to betray your family.  Dick Cheney is the Vice President and therefore number two in the Republican party.  A party that is going to try to get George Bush re-elected, and one of the campaign platforms of this party is a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.  Cheney's daughter is an open lesbian.  Doesn't his support for this amendment betray his daughter? Is this the price one has to pay to be powerful, demonizing a member of their own family?  Is this how you repay the party that pulls your puppet strings, by supporting an amendment that will make it illegal for your loved one to marry the love of their life?         This country was founded on freedom, the settlers left England to escape tyranny, and gain freedoms.  Freedom of religion, freedom of expression, free press, and free speech, all of these were so important to the founding fathers of this nation that the are in the very first amendment.  Apparently this country's freedoms do not extend to you if you love a member of the same sex.  The Statue of Liberty does not read "Give me your tired, poor huddled masses, unless you are gay and want to marry, then just go away."  Why then are homosexuals treated as lesser citizens?  One thing I find funny is that people use religious arguments to support anti-gay legislation. Part of what make this country great is the separation of church and state, and the freedom of religion, so religion has no place in the debate of this constitutional amendment.  All of the ultra-conservatives religious fanatics that shout "Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve," need to realize that the freedom that gives them the right to believe that statement is the same freedom that gives people the right to go against it.         Dick Cheney's wife came out recently in an interview and said she believed it was up to the states to decide whether or not to recognize gay marriage.  That statement is in direct violation of the Republican line, and fall right in with the Kerry campaign.  I guess the puppet strings only reach so far.  As far as I am concerned if you love someone you should be allowed to marry them even if your names are Adam and Steve.  What's the big deal if Adam and Steve want to get married, if it makes them happy , why not allow it.  I think the President Bush would want as many happy Americans as possible, happy Americans vote for who made them happy.  I also think Big Dick needs to take a look in his own house before supporting a constitutional amendment that would take away freedoms from a member of his own family.  That is just one guy's opinion!

            At this years Olympics in Athens, the us will be represented by Maurice Greene.  In a world where people outside the US think of us as loud, rude and generally obnoxious, we will be represented by someone who typifies all of these attributes.  Mo Greene is the self proclaimed "Greatest of all time," and rarely will he pass up the opportunity to let you know this fact.  While Greene has run a sub 100m dash 47 times in his career, his attitude and celebrations are equally as astonishing.  In the last Olympics he was a ring leader of one of the most embarrassing post race displays in which the Men's 4x100 meter relay team celebrated their gold medal by draping them selves in the American Flag and posing in front of photographers in a variety of poses usually reserve for a body building contest.  Then several months ago at a tune up meet for the Olympic trials Greene had a teammate spray his shoes with a fire extinguisher after he won the finals of the 100m dash.  The Olympics are based on the premise of world camaraderie through sports.  This does not include showing up all over your opponents with the actions of a testosterone enhanced peacock.  Olympic athletes are supposed to be ambassadors of this great country and are supposed to represent everything that is good about the United States.  Instead this year at the Olympics we will be represented by someone who has repeatedly represented every stereo type the world has for us.    One more note regarding the Olympics.  Many athletes from NBA, and the Williams sisters declined invitations to participate sitting security concerns as the reason.  I find this very self centered, there are literally hundreds to thousands of athletes in this country who would love to have the privilege of competing for there country.  I wonder if these people realize that the last terrorist attack that took place at the Olympics was in Atlanta, and was carried out by an American.  Grow up Serena, you are not that important that the terrorist are going to single you out, and didn't the last attack on a tennis player in a public place happen at a respected tennis tournament.  You have the opportunity to lead our nation to gold, and you back out and site security, give me a break, you probably want more time to design clothes or hob-nob with celebs.   That's just one guy's opinion!
