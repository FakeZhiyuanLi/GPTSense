      Three points I'd like to make... 1) Ok...I shall try to make my hair a more vivid blue by boiling Kool-Aid in vinegar...heh heh heh...crazy piano teacher college student...what would I do without your advice...Then for the school year, (no crazy hair!:( ) I shall go over the blue with Copper Highlights. Cool, huh? 2) Could someone change the vote button on the poll? The phrase just freaks me out... 3) I'm sorry I won't be at lanscape class, Dopugie! *Sigh* I guess you now have Brian all to yourself...IT'S SO UNFAIR!

      The_Tractor posted this on the  urlLink BotD  and it seemed to die away, so I wanted to revive it.  I'm thinking about getting stuff so that I can play Dungeons and Dragons with people. If you don't know what it is, it's the nerdiest pencil and paper game on the face of the Earth, but it's fun. I was thinking that a grout of people would get together at my house every friday or something and mess around and play and whatnot. It's mainly to stay in touch, and if you want to play, just post something. Happy nerdiness!  Anyway, I'd be very interested in doing a campaign with some other people(I could DM maybe....) so if you want to join, just comment here!

      And it is when you look into that bright light at the end of the tunnel that you realize "Oh God, we are so fucked." This is where we begin and end.  One bright summer afternoon when all is well, birds chirping, sun blasting it's radioactive death rays down onto us, not an apocalyptic cloud in the sky; everything can go awry in a matter of seconds.  Just when everything seems ordinary, the extraordinary goes and gives you one giant wallop in the face.  A small child, it could be any small child, but let's just call him Billy, was frolicking in his back yard when the sky opened up. This is your extraordinary. What happens when the sky opens up, you ask?  Well, let me tell you my children, it is not a pleasant thing.  Your eyes boil and your skin melts, then you are torn to shreds in a matter of nanoseconds.  The sky, you see, wants to fill this void and therefore needs matter to fill it.  This matter could come from anywhere, typically it uses oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen that's floating in the air.  But this is different.  It wants Billy.  When the sky opens up, it creates a giant BOOM which feels very much like being punched by a 15 foot novelty boxing glove.  This knocked him to the ground, and allowed him to see this extraordinary event take place.  As he lay flattened on the grass, unable to breath, his vision began to go askew, making everything bubble.  His eyes were indeed boiling, soon they will become part of a soup formally known as his central nervous system.  At this very moment, his skin became prickily and wet.  His skin was indeed melting, soon to become a puddle on the grass.  Shortly after, he was ripped into the vortex, his body torn to bits, then reassembled in whatever fashion it could be reassembled.  As he swirls through the atmosphere, or rather lack of one, he sees a bright light. This is your light at the end of the tunnel. He had always been told in church and by his parents that the light at the end of the tunnel symbolized hope.  This, however, is not the case in this situation.  Billy attempts to reach his hand up for that bright light, only to hear the garbled tearing of muscle in the wind.  It has Billy.  His arm, at least.  What is this bright light you ask?  Well, interpret it as you wish.  This is up to you.  Billy's eyes started to water, he knew it was the end.  When he reached that light, it felt as though he had been reborn.  The purest water you can't even imagine washed over him, cleansed his body and mind, and restored him to his former self.  But for what? He had been stranded in the middle of nowhere, to die.  His light was some kind of hope, but it was also his greatest fear, and will cause his demise. He walks. And as he walks, the world around him begins to form into something familiar.  It is at this moment he realizes what has happened. He collapsed into himself. But what kind of life is this?  He is alone in his mind, and what will happen when his subconscious takes over?  This will have to wait for next time.

      For the first time since the end of school I met up with Brandon and Sean to PK at Vincent Elementary, and DAMN WAS IT AWESOME!!  I got there about 20 minutes before everyone else and pk'd some, but really not a lot seeing as I feel tired.  AANYWAY.  I drilled monkey vaults and attempted some kongs, which I still freak out on and dont put my legs through my arms.  Oh well.  Um, we talked a lot and ate food some.  Then when Brandon got there we started going around the playground a little bit.  Much to my surprise, I found that rolling on woodchips is not comfortable after a 10 foot drop, they feel like little rocks digging into your spine.  So I went back to vaulting this little tube thing, that was fun. Then Sean came and we practiced wall-runs, stretched, and did some flow activities.  I need to relax for a little bit, but not moving for a day is rough.  I'm addicted!!!

      First of all, I'm finally in the blog.  Second, I had the strangest dream when I was in North Carolina.  I walked up to a bottle of aloe.  I said to myself, "Hmmm, I wonder what this would taste like..."  So I picked up a spoon and squirted some aloe into it.  I ate the aloe, and it didn't taste too bad.  I kept eating and eating until I started to feel sick.  Then I read on the label: do not consume aloe.  If you do, drink lots of water, but only if you live near a water tower.  If you don't, the water could be contaminated with animal feces.  So that's it.  When I remembered the dream in the kayak place, I remembered the taste and started feeling really sick.  It didn't help when Evan started showing me all of the aloe bottles...

      I'm back home from North Carolina! WHEE!!  Anyway, hope everyone had as much fun while I was gone as I did.  We arrived on Topsail Beach Sunday morning after driving for.... 9 hours I believe, and when we got in everything was clean and cool and oh-so pretty.  So we wasted no time in getting unpacked, then I went down to the beach with Trachtman and we flopped around in the waves for a good bit.  That's pretty much what we did.  On Monday we went downtown to get some ice cream/play miniature golf/go to the arcade, which was sweet.  I had mint chocolate chip, oh so tasty. Tuesday: More beach, got sunburnt : ( and then we went out for lunch.  I had onion rings and a grilled cheese sandwich.  God was that a mistake, the onion rings decided to take baths in grease before I consumed them, so that they could eat my stomach lining and render me useless for the rest of the day.  Ouch.  That night we played Spoons, in which Mrs. Trachtman and I were the victors. Wednesday:  Stomach said "Ok, I killed the nasty grease," and I was on my way.  I practiced front flips that day for a bit, landed on my back a lot, scraped my head once, and hit my heels a few times.  Then we(Tracht-dogg, Mrs. Trachtman and I) went to go kayaking, but we saw some lightning and were instructed to turn back, so we did and got a pass for a free hour of kayaking the next day.   Thursday:  I hung around at the house after waking up late, waiting to go kayaking...  So we went around 11:00 and it turns out the tide isn't high enough for us to go out on the water, and there's a group of 21 coming in later.  So we are instructed to come back around 4:30.  We get back, go down to the beach for a few hours, and I come out really really really tired(flipping over waves is fun!!).  So then we went kayaking, finally, for our full hour.  Only this time my parents came along.  So we got there and I found some nice nice shoes(Merrell Chameleons... droooolllll.....) but they were $100, and I had already bought new shoes for PK.  And they didn't have any in a big enough size.  Blah.  Ok, 1 hour of Kayaking, I led the group most of the way, it was a lot of fun and made me realize that I'm actually in shape!  I wasn't tired by the end of it, I was impressed.  Anyway, it was great.  There were some fish jumping out of the water, I'm not sure what kind(Ben, you remember?)...  But it was pretty, there was marsh grass and the water was only like 2 feet deep, pretty neat.  Then we went home and played spoons again.  I didn't win. Friday:  We went home... Drove a lot.  Stayed at a hotel.  I got a sinus headache.  Couldn't fall asleep until 1:00 a.m. Saturday:  HOME, WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!  After a lot of driving, we finally made it home!  It felt nice to get back into Pughtown and see my puppy-hound and brother and everything.  It just felt so good, I was home!  So I hung around a bit with Matt and read the new Newsweek, then brought my stuff in.  After that I went out and PK'd like a madman, it felt wonderful.  My legs were dying to PK, and when I finally did, they just absorbed everything.  Cleared the 4.5 foot fence like it was nothing, it felt fantastic.  Climbed up my porch and spun around over the rail, then went inside.  I had missed that so much.  Then we went out for dinner and I ate food.  Now I am not hungry.  Then videogames.  Now I'm on AIM wondering why music isn't playing.  Well, that's it. SO LONG AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH

      Yay! I'm in in blog! That was the greatest concert I've ever been to...ever! Ok, Peter Frampton was amazing on the guitar. For those of you who love the guitar I suggest you listen to one of his songs. But, STYX IS THE GREATEST BAND!!!!!!! I know most of you expected Styx to be old and crippled by now, but it has been more than 4 decades ago since Styx started (so they must be in thier late 40's, early 50's, or late 50's) but they were dancing around up there jumping over the equipment, doing highkicks, and seemed they were in their 30's! Their voices even sounded exactly the same from the early years! The person who played the keyboard (and did a lot of the lead singing) is officially my new hero. He's also really amusing. Randomly in the middle of the concert he turned to the rest of Styx and said, "Well, we know you can rock, but can you...rag-time?" And he started playing rag-time on the keyboard and everyone on stage started square dancing. And all of Styx was steaming hot, with their tight, tight, tight, tight pants, esp. the keyboardist who had the tighest pants of all, and...well, I'll just stop there, for all of your sakes...STYX ROCKS!!!!!!!!!  For more on the concert, go to my other blog, www.thehopelesslifeofgabo.blogspot.com

      Hello everyone, and here is the first post on Rhythm Section.  Have you ever seen the Nike ads with the guys jumping from building to building, climbing through car parks and the like?  Perhaps you've seen the Scion ad with the Traceurs(Freerunners) and would like to know more.  This sport has become my passion, I would like to spread it to you.  The definitive site for worldwide Traceurs is  urlLink Urban Freeflow .  They have extraordinarily friendly message boards, tutorials for various parts of Parkour, as well as information about jams happening all around the world.  I strongly encourage that you check it out.  If you want to just watch some videos you can also check out  urlLink Le-Parkour.com .  It's an intriguing/invigorating sport. Enjoy!

(22:49:18) Jood: It was at this moment that the other men realized that without that old pool shooter, this world would fall apart. (22:50:05) Jood: And when they had this apocalyptic epiphany, they all dropped their jaws, and let their eyes grow wide with amazement as they watched his silhouette fall into the horizon (22:50:34) Dougie: as he dropped 500 feet onto a raging river that flowed over razor-sharp spikes (22:50:40) Dougie: that were poisonous (22:50:46) Dougie: and explosive (22:50:54) Jood: doug. you just lost the cinematic feel (22:50:55) Jood: c'mon (22:51:27) Dougie: and the a glorious, soaring eagle picks him up and wraps him in an American flag (22:51:30) Dougie: then* (22:51:41) Dougie: and everybody breakdances (22:52:08) Jood: Only to have the flag burn his skin, like holy water on a demons chest.  This is when everyone knew his true identity. (22:52:35) Dougie: Lord Gribnak had returned! (22:55:21) Jood: Only to wield his mighty sword, and thrust it to the heavens!  And Hell rained down upon the earth, bringing an end to this meaningless process we call life. (22:55:46) Dougie: and everybody died happily ever after (22:56:01) Jood: Fin.

        Everybody's dying just to get the disease      Not in a fantastic mood, I am bored, and need a distraction.  Hence posting and random Elliott Smith lyrics.  Just so you guys know, either/or is an amazing album.  It's a little soft but angst-ridden and slightly depressing, but beautiful.  I love it, love it to death.  Anyway... Hmm... Let's see. I'm looking into overclocking my little rosewill nVidia GeForce FX5500 256 MB 128-bit videocard, and I did, just a teeny bit.  The core-clock frequency is now 300 mhz as opposed to the original 270, and it still runs nice and cool.  The memory frequency is upped like 15 mhz as well.  But that is all the overclocking I will do in this.(Wait... the processor is already overclocked... oh well! i'll take a 400 mhz FSB!)  Hmm.... Ok, ima go play with this utility I just downloaded.  so.. have fun!

      Rachel, could you talk to RJ about making it so that the rest of our characters could be level 3 as well? Seeing as how we don't have too much money (except for Quig and Dougie) and you have about 1000, I don't think it's very fair.  Also, I think that it would benefit the whole group as well as individual players, because Quig and Dougie would get more spells and stuff like that.  On a completely different note, do you think that I should make a blog devoted specifically to our D&D campaign?  And on another completely different note, do you think it would be possible to have a D&D sleepover at some point?

      Doug, I apologize for slapping you after you fainted when fighting that dragon, Spork, awesome job crossing that bridge, Ben, next time, bring more changes of clothes.  By the way, I have a question for the D&D experts: I was looking in my PHB, and my feat Combat Casting says I should gain a +4 on my concentration checks.  My concentration is 6, with a 4 under "ranks".  Should I add another 4 under "Misc Modifiers"?  Just a question.

      Hi everyone. I haven't been paying attention this thingy much because no one posts, and if they do it's doesn't apply to me.  But now that I'm in RJ's epic evil campaign, I suppose I should. (ph33r t3h \/a|\/|pir3 |3l@ckgu4rd)

      I guess I should start paying attention the again, seeing as I now joined RJ's 16th level EVIL campaign. You will all learn to ph33r the vampire blackguard. Except that RJ is starting us out with no equipment. SUGGESTED GOLD IS 260k, I HAVE NATZINK. And I totally generated a +3 Unholy Flaming Burst Intelligent Larger Greatsword with Deathwatch always cast and 10 Ranks in Intimidate, which I would hide in my Glove of Storing Soulknife style because RJ didn't let me be a Soulknife. In conclusion, whee. I wonder how many non-DnD brains I just melted with this post.

Im all for it, i think we should start a phone chain and circulate the word. each person calls two other people... ok well i gtg, im all for it tho!

       This is Dougie speaking on Sporko's behalf, since she is in New Orleans and must pay for an Internet connection with money out of her own pocket. Getting to the point, Sporko wants people to bring their yearbooks with them to school so that she might have a chance to sign them. I'm bringing mine, you should too.

       Unfortunatly, it is unlikely that a "cross-dressing day" will happen. The only day it is possible is Tuesday. Monday and Thursday we have off, Wednesday, is the awards ceremony for the atletic awards and honors, (Mrs. Braxton will be taking pictures) and obviously due to commencement we will be unable switch on Friday. (That is of course unless Katie is willing to give up her Versace dress or Cimmie plans on losing a hundred pounds so she can fit in a guy's outfit). Nevertheless, we have to do this switch on Tuesday, if at all. This wont work if someone forgets or backs out thinking "Oh my God, if I cross-dress I won't graduate, because they'll expell me!" We need to coordinate plans since our only choice of a day is the next day we have school. We need to figure out something soon. My Idea is the following: In this 'chatterbox,' write your name if you are   willing  to participate. Maybe we'll do it if more than half the class is willing. After that, I'll make arrangements with people asking if they can let someone borrow their skirt or pants. I will also support requests so Emily can get in Kyle's pants. Below is the chatterbox and I hope this can happen with your support.   Write your First name, and whether or not you are willing to participate.      var chatterbox = 'no';         urlLink target="flooblechatterbox"  onClick="window.open('about:blank','flooblechatterbox','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,copyhistory=no,width=480,height=400');return true;">  align="absbottom">Talk   in my  urlLink flooble chatterbox, a free javascript chat tag board / shoutbox / tagboard program for your xanga, diary, blogger or weblog  |   urlLink logic puzzles, brainteasers      if (!chatterbox || chatterbox != 'ok') {  document.write('This  urlLink flooble chatterbox  is'); document.write(' temporarily unavailable. It will be back up shortly.'); }

       for some odd reason my mother (yes, my mother) felt the need to discuss the cross-dressing day with me and she thinks it would be funny, but says we should do it (if we do it at all) on Tuesday because wednesday is the moving up ceremony and the acedemic awards thingy so people will be in full "dress code mode" and they might not approve...

       We should totally do a cross dressing day. While I fully understand about the whole uncomfortable to wear a skirt and problem with getting the right sizes things, we should still do it becuase it would be really funny and no one's ever done it before.

       ok so here's my thought: since we have the awards ceremony on wednesday, june 2nd, it would be wise to be dressed in regular uniform for that event. We, however, could switch dress codes on tuesday. That was a good idea tori, with going to the trift store, because it would also be problematic if we didn't get our uniforms back in time for the awards ceremony on wednesday (I don't know about the rest of you, but i only own one kilt that fits me). If anyone likes this idea, please say so in your next blog

       From now on, you  have to  include titles.  This is because otherwise, it seems like you named your post something else.  For instance,  A Wrinkle in Time  by Madeleine L'Engle would be called  It was a dark and stormy....   Doesn't work.  That includes you too, Emily Combe.

This is not finalized and I don't want only like one person showing up so I have included a poll stating if we should go. I will decide whether or not the movie is on based on the popularity of the category "yes we should do it." If it is less than half, than the trip is off (and visa versa). I hope we can do it tonight at 7:00.    urlLink The Day After Tomorrow (PG-13, 124 min.)| 7:00pm |     THE MOVIE IS OFF, NO ONE WILL BE ATTENDING TONIGHT'S MOVIE

       This blog is being posted due to the fact that little development has happened recently regarding the last day of school uniform swap. If we all plan to switch uniforms with a certain individual, we must somehow organize something soon. Also what do we consider the last day of school? I think if  everyone  participates, this will be a success. We must plan this soon and pray that there is not a drop-the-dress-code-day on the last day of school.

       You are indeed right, Sporko. I do have lots of friends. Lots of very good friends without whom I am uncertain as to what my fate would have been. And believe me, I love you all too.  In other news, Tucker created this awesome piece of work, possibly using declassified CIA technology:       It's going to be the cover for Ted's album when it is released. That should be happening fairly soon, with any luck at all. Oh, and you can click right  urlLink here  if you want to see a real photo of Ted.

       I know you're gonna hate this Dougie, but i have to post this. This is  one of Dougies away messenges... "I have nobody. My dad, the last person left in my life who believed in me, just got turned against me by my mom. My sister hates my guts and my mom and my dad think I'm a slacker. My grades have dropped in school and I'm going to end the year by disgracing myself. I'm probably going to do badly on my finals. The ex-marine who used to live here is breaking into our studio to use it and he's messing with our dogs. Add in the whole unrequited love and teenage angst, and my life is 100%, unfiltered, premium, grade A shit" I think this means that we have a friend in need, if everyone is willing to donate something that would cheer our heart-broken friend up, post it, donate to the "boost-dougies-self-esteem-fund". Thank You

       Hi, you know you love  urlLink Apple , but only 1% of computer users use it. Most of the 98% of  urlLink Windows  users say that they don't use  urlLink Macs  because of compatibility (where only few of their beloved Windows programs are not usable on Macs.) I don't think that was among the things that bothered  urlLink this man  but he was definitely bothered. Don't get me wrong that I dislike Apple Computers (because I am about to switch, as I like them more than windows machines), but this is one of the funniest videos I have ever seen. This man speaks of his experience on the Mac very badly, but it is funny because although he "dislikes Macs" he still uses them and even edited the video on a Mac.  urlLink Check it out here  , and   enjoy .

       ::clap::, at least someone is on my side, I have nothing against Emily (well for this argument at least) but I just don't see what's she's adding to this blog, she just screws everything up, breaks all the rules and then does a stupid lie apology and does it again. It's really not cool.

       i take it i have been banned from speaking in hacker, sayign i doubt anyof you can read hacker fluently (knowing a few words is NOT considered fluent.) blah, where did quiggy go anyway, i miss him. and emily the poll that tuck put up was "mabye later if she breaks more rules" and "yes" i personaly voted yes, you have broken enough rules as it is. 60% says "mabye later" its later we shoudl kick you out, youve broken enough rules. 40% thought we should have kicked you out a while ago. quiggy, we need your expert advice on this matter (or your password so i can kick her out.) for now, this is sporko reporting from SBC (sporko brodcasting company)

       It's fine. I know, Quiggy did break his own rule, but that was 'cause he had sort of... well, he freaked out, frankly. And we can use mild curse words, if you really want to. And, of course, you can curse as much as you want as long as it's in a different language. For instance, I frequently say bugger (although, that's just British slang, not a different language). And I am certainly going to miss you too. And you. And you. Heck, I'll miss all of you.  In other news, I figured out what was messing the blog up and I fixed it, so everything's back to normal, although you might want to check out the sidebar for the updated rules. I did some tweaking.

       thanks dougie----again, I'm sorry taco and quiggy and dougie. I do not understand why we cannot use curse words, seeing that quiggy broke his OWN rule by using the word--and i quote "fucking" in one of his posts-----again I am sorry, and i just wana keep this blog going as long as possible, I'm going to miss all you guys soo much next year!

       Do you think maybe we could keep the fightin' and the feudin' to a minimum?  To Tucker: Scroll down. Emily apologized, she had not read your post. I, at least, am not going to kick her out. Also, as you are not an admin you don't set the rules, although I would prefer mild swear words (or badly misspelled ones ::cough  urlLink danmmed  cough::) to a constant stream of not-so-mild ones. One other thing is, we don't all always spell everything right. I know I don't.  To Emily: Tucker is right in that a proper respect for the rules should be maintained. However, as you did apologize, I don't see any real problem.  To Quiggy: Where the heck are you, Quiggy!? This blog is succumbing to chaos! There is looting and pillaging in the streets! Somebody, light the Quig-signal!  We need you Quiggy!

Well, you just used your last chance, someone please kick Emily out!!! I'm not trying to be mean but shes breaking every rule and grr....I'm done.

So I have to think of something meaningful for the 100th post on the blog of the damned. ::puts on trucker thinking hat:: ::thinks:: well, the trucker hat of knowledge hasn't helped me at all. phui. Well, this was fun lets do it again sometime. Whoever centered the whole blog (quiggy...) should be brutally beaten my me it looks weird, at least I think it does. P.S. Everone should please put up post titles.

             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meg, everyone loves him/her but nobody knows her real sexual identity. That was all to change when we did a drive by of Sonoco's A-plus. Cimmie handed the slip asking whether she/he preferred Coke or Pepsi which Taylor had recently typed up, and...after much speculation over the whole "it's for a school newspaper" alabi, Meg filled out the form. The first field was her name which we told him/her was unnecessary to fill out so she left it blank. Right below that field, however was the most important field...the gender question. It asked wheter or not Meg was a girl or if she was a boy. Taylor waited until we left A-plus to read it. And it read FEMALE. I was shocked Meg is/was/will be a female. I was convinced she was a he, but I am starting to face reality and I can't wait to see Meg over the summer when I visit A-plus.  Oh and P.S. Emily, USE TITLES!

       Have you ever had a craving to make your own song? Get a laugh? Eat some Chinese food? No? Well you need to go to this website to get some inspiration and a laugh, but I don't think they offer Chinese food. I am not going to ruin any surprises but it sounds pretty cool if you type in the only large field in the website (I wont say what it's labeled)"I found this place not to long ago, This is too much fun. I know what I will do tonight." Don't ask someone told me to do it and it the result is surprisingly good. You wont regret clicking on  urlLink this link . Enjoy!

        Dear Emily (needs-a)Comb,  I am posting this just to say that I'm sorry if I did something that triggered that outbreak where you demanded that I leave this blog. it is in my most heartfelt manner that I ask why you demanded that I leave the blog, other than the fact that I stole sporko from you I can see no reason for you to hate me. Because of that outburst I have decided to kill you....with hugs and caring.  Thanks for your time, Taco

       I have a new idea, quite possibly the best one yet.  We should split into two teams, the United States of Blog and the Confederate States of Blog.  Each team gets their own blog.  Each team also gets their own Brain-Eating account.  For one week, each team tries to eat more brains than the other team.  You may affect B of D, however the changes must be fixable.  Doug and I would be on seperate teams, and would not make any new administrators or delete old ones.  Vote in the new poll to vote on whether or not this is cool.

       ...if you're desperately bored or have an addiction to voting in polls. In case the previous sentence didn't tip you off, the Blog of the Danmmed is proud to bring you another poll! The results of the previous poll indicated that Quiggy and I are evil mutant lobster chickens, which would explain why typing is so difficult.

       That was the greatest concert I've ever been to...ever! Ok, Peter Frampton was amazing on the guitar. For those of you who love the guitar I suggest you listen to one of his songs. But, STYX IS THE GREATEST BAND!!!!!!! I know most of you expected Styx to be old and crippled by now, but it has been more than 4 decades ago since Styx started (so they must be in thier late 40's, early 50's, or late 50's) but they were dancing around up there jumping over the equipment, doing highkicks, and seemed they were in their 30's! Their voices even sounded exactly the same from the early years! The person who played the keyboard (and did a lot of the lead singing) is officially my new hero. He's also really amusing. Randomly in the middle of the concert he turned to the rest of Styx and said, "Well, we know you can rock, but can you...rag-time?" And he started playing rag-time on the keyboard and everyone on stage started square dancing. And all of Styx was steaming hot, with their tight, tight, tight, tight pants, esp. the keyboardist who had the tighest pants of all, and...well, I'll just stop there, for all of your sakes...STYX ROCKS!!!!!!!!!

       Quiggy is not being oppressive; he is discriminating accordingly. So far in its virtual existence, The Blog of the Danmmed has existed as a haven for Montgomery students, now ex-Montgomery students of course, and he is merely sticking by the principles on which this blog was founded. While in the future there may be exceptions to this, you have not made an overly convincing case for yourself. I hope that future animosity between the denizens of the BotD and yourself may be avoided, and I do apologize if the current configuration of the BotD has caused you any distress. However, we are currently unable to fulfill your wish to join, and as your present actions contradict any perceived desire you might have to join, we do not see a possibility of a wish of that nature being fulfilled in the foreseeable future. Once again, I apologize for the inconvenience.

        I have been pretty bored this summer. I have watched tv and played video games and sometimes gone to the pool. Now that the public schools are out I will actually have someting fun to do.

       First of all, I know who wrote the stuff on the Chatterbox.  It was Evan's brother, Matt.  Evan and Matt are down in NC with me and that is my IP address.  He used Evan's laptop.  Because I revealed the evil (not to say hilarious) prankster, we should not have the chatterbox post/blog post rule.  If that rule stays in effect, I will have to flood the blog again, and remember how irritating that got?  I wil also flood the chatterbox just to get rid of the great prank messages.

        Just so everyone knows, I am temporarily enforcing a new rule: if you post,  you must also enter a message into the chatterbox   This is twofold: it will help remove the offensive messages, and it will help me catch the doer of these evil doings.   SHOULD YOU NOT LEAVE A MESSAGE, I MAY ASSUME THAT IT IS YOU!!!

       Attention everybody:  this is a public service announcement.  The chatterbox is completely rude and offensive.  Unless the person responsible comes forward, they will be kicked out when they are discovered.  Should they come forward, they will only recieve one warning.  Thank you.

       I'm thinking about getting stuff so that I can play Dungeons and Dragons with people.  If you don't know what it is, it's the nerdiest pencil and paper game on the face of the Earth, but it's fun.  I was thinking that a grout of people would get together at my house every friday or something and mess around and play and whatnot.  It's mainly to stay in touch, and if you want to play, just post something.  Happy nerdiness!

       Hey Everybody! Thanks so much for votin' yes to allow me in and those that voted no... thanks anyway.  So anywho the pool thing sounds like fun but I am dreadfully confused.  Who's house?  Emily's or Tori's???  Well the one thing I know is that it won't be at my house on account of the fact that if anybody wanted to swim... it would be in my bathtub.  Well best of luck to whoever figures this out.  I will come though... where ever and whenever it may be.  So that is all for now. Cheerio,  Kelsey

       Here's an idea for that pool party: if we were to have a pool party at night, it would probably be best to have a sleep-over because I have a feeling that my parents, at least, would be somewhat less than willing to pick me up at someone's house at whatever it may be, 2 AM or whatever. So, as I said, if it were a sleep-over it could go as late as we wanted without any worries.  Just an idea.

I just got a ton of crazy like hard-core garage rock stuff and a hard-core garage rock pedal so I need to record and it's gonna sound so cool with like the wailing clarinet in the backround and then erics have to do a solo with my pedal!! It's gonna be amazing.

       It's the future of concerts!! I was at the Blink 182/ No Doubt concert, which was seroiuly rockin' and they had this thingy, were they played like a slower song and they were like "before many of u were born, in the late 90's, during a slow song poeple held up lighters, but now it's the techonloy age and everything so in recongion of this ever hold up you're cell phones instead". Cool idea right, well its was awesome, one of the coolest thing's I've ever seen. Just had to share that moment, and i got a cool pic but it was too dark and didnt come out right.

       20 things I have learned Through My eighth Grade Experience: 1. Before you insult someone, make sure they are not standing behind you. You will save yourself much explaining and stuttering and awkwardness this way 2. TRY to remember where you left your bag - they have a tendency to move around 3. learn how to open your locker rather than having someone else do it all year long 4. Never volunteer if you don't know what you will be doing 5. Be creative with your excuses 6. continuation of #5: become emotional 7. DON'T GIVE PEOPLE YOUR PENS (YOU WILL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN) 8. Visible bra straps are a no-no 9. The same goes for clear dresses 10. Don't be downwright mean to anyone without proper contemplation - you might need them to do something for you later 11. When in doubt, employ the phrase "I didn't do it!" 12. be inconspicuous when chewing illegal gum 13. Always get out of running laps - again, be creative and remember, it's all in the timing... 14. Make friends with the lunch people 15. Wear the specified socks  16. EVERYTHING has a loophole - it's your job to find them 17. listen to everyones advice and then promptly disregard it (haha ms. V and the box projects) 18. remember that you will be seeing these people almost every day for the next year - be nice to them 19. inside jokes will not seem funny when you tell them to others - hence the name inside jokes. And...last but not least... 20. Stand out  I hope you all feel very knowledgable now. --feel free to post your own knowledge you acquired this year

       Ok, today we have my favorite music list, stolen straight from the blog of Gabo. (not in order)     THE WHITE STRIPES!! ::  (::insert loud cheering here::) um...well everything, there are only about 2 or 3 white stripes songs i dont love, but i still like all of it. But if I had to choose a favorite it would be the self titled cd. NIRVANA!!: they have this three disk CD thingy, titled Nirvana (hm..how orginial), thats the best one. Franz Ferinand: one of the CD's in my stereo now, is there one and only CD, self titled Phantom Planet: yes Carson, I do like some emo, both of Their CD's are awesome but the second one is my favorite Jimi Hendrix: Are you expierienced (or the greatest hits, but thats kinda cheating) Led Zepplin: IV and III Crystal Method: greatest techno band ever, um..it's the CD with the crab on it, damn, don't remember the name     Ramones: again I'm gonna cheat and say Greatest hits Red Hot Chili Peppers: By the Way Vines: Winning Day's Weezer: Pinkerton (yes more emo, but only pinkerton) VON BONDIES!!: amazing band, you have to buy Pawn Shoppe Heart Hives: Veni Vedi Vicuois (expect spelled right) Less than Jake: fine I give up, Hello Rockveiw and Anthem are good, but Pezcore still sucks!! Muse: have no idea what the album is... AC/DC: Back in Black, you HAVE to buy this Modest Mouse: damn the radio for over playing this song, this was MY song, i predicted it would get big and now everyone sings it :: sob:: Black Sabbath: We Sold our Souls for Rock and Roll, best quote ever..." I was into sex, drugs and rock and roll, was paying for the sex and the drugs"- Ozzy Bush: Sixteeth Stone, everything zen is a awesome song... Metallica: Saint Anger Green Day: (I'm cheating again) Greatest Hit's Yeah, that's a pretty good list but I'm sure I left someone out...

       This is an awesome story, it's the weirdest accident ever... A construction worker in Lancaster, Calif., is   expected to make a full recovery after accidentally being shot in the   head with a nail gun -- six times. Three of the nails penetrated his   brain; one entered his spinal column, but luckily not his spinal cord.   Witnesses say Isidro Mejia, 39, fell from the roof of the house he was   building onto another worker who was using the gun below. "The guy   holding the nail gun was grabbing to keep from falling, and just   gripped tighter on the trigger," said a Los Angeles County sheriff's   investigator. "It's a nail gun they use for framing. It can drive nails   through 2-by-4s." (Los Angeles Times) ...It's the first time L.A. cops   have said it: a Mexican guy really was framed.    urlLink pictures (don't worry, just x-rays)

       Wow, this is really sad...All of my friends are away so instead I'm spending my time over a celebirty obsession of Craig Nicholls, or as I like to call him CN, (the crazy lead guitarist and singer of The Vines) who looks like he's stoned...but..oh well...so does Green Poncho Boy... Anyway, for all of you Vines lovers out there (like myself). Here's the most amazing music video ever!!!!!!... Ride...(I'm lazy so just cut and paste this in the address box yourself)... http://www.nme.com/features/107518.htm  If you want more of my pointless ramblings of CN or the lyric to Ride, go to my blog...you know where it is...

       that was the best year i have ever had, and no i am not lying to you, i have never had a more meaningfull, fun, amazing, awesome, slinkster cool, time ever. and i know that a lot of you think that too, but i am just stating facts like i allways do. the best parts of the entire year: 1. the first day of school. 2. the first dance (when i met tucker). 3. the malvern dance (not the kiss). 4. the play. 5. the whole (yes whole) canada trip (moaches!) 6. graduation 7. getting hugs from everyone   8. knowing that i will never forget any of you or the stuff we went through, no matter how hard i try (ill only be trying to forget some things) 9. seeing every one together for the last time and loving everything about it all. thank you so much for all the wonderfull and not so wonderfull times we had, it was the most amazing year i have ever had and will stay the best danmmed year ever! -Rachel (AKA sporko)

       Your random history lesson of the day.  (Because it pertains to my 20th Century Project).  Franz, also known as Francis, Ferdinand was the Archduke of Austria-Hungary in 1914.  In early July, he and his wife were driving through the town of Sarajevo, Bosnia, when 19 year-old Gavrilo Princip stepped out of the crowd and opened fire.  This event triggered world war 1, one of the bloodiest military conflicts of all time.

       three awesome bands for you today... Bumblebeez 81- these guys r pretty garage rocky but all there songs r mixed by one of there own who is a pro dj so really cool sounding. Very slickly combining hives and white stripes...these guys have a video that im sure is gonna be playing on mtv very soon so look out for them.   Whirlwind Heat- i gurantee you have never and will never hear of these guys from anyone but me... they are very odd, have thier own flare, a personal favorite of mine...  The Dirtbombs- love LOVE these guys, very cool have two of every intersting, but are still pretty smooth and jazzy, kinda up beat too but still rocking  i have a few other bands that you should check out but arent as good and have no chance at stardom.... -The Soledad Brothers (blues...no one here would like them) -Blanche (smooth as silk)  OK, im done.. goodbye until next time...

       Back in the age of pirates, there was one ship that ruled the seas.  It was a typical pirate ship, with a typical captain.  The only strange thing was that the captain always wore a red shirt.  One day, one of the crew members went up to the captain and asked, "Why do you always wear that red shirt?"  "Oh that?" asked the captain.  "I wear that so that if I ever get shot, you will never see the blood, so that you can keep in fighting the same."  And so the guy walked away thinking  OK, that's pretty cool.  We've got a pretty great guy for our captain .  Later that day, an enemy ship started approaching.  The pirates got ready for battle, and started sailing towards the enemies.  They shot a few warning shots, which were responded with other shots.  Soon, both sides were almost ready to fight when the captain yelled back to the crew, "Quick!  Go get my brown pants!"

      Went to Sydney's with Cimmie and Eric yesterday. Got the hose out and slid down the pool cover and used it as a slip 'n slide (of course I got mud all over Eric to avenge Chealsey), trampoline (to dry off), movies like Interview with a Vampire (talk about blood, sex, and gore...I love it! JK), wrote in eachother's yearbooks (I'm still confused as to why I wrote the stuff I did), and we were gonna call people but didn't (oh well). We also went down to a health food store and got...well health food (oh soy milk...how would i survive without you?!). I gotta go back and visit that nerd at the checkout...

      Ok, who is the one who is voting for body hair as thier turn on? I hope it's a girl...If a guy is voting that...wow...I could imagine, "That's right, ladies. Let those drumsticks grow thier wheat fields like they were born to!!!" *Shudder* Well, actually shaving is a pain in the ass and- *bangs over head with a Bible* Bad, Gabo!!! Someone like Gus, or Ben, or Cookie Obsesser ( :) jk, Cookie! I Think I'll call him Cookie Monster) might be voting for it! *shudder, shudder, shiver, whimper* Well, personally, I like the tight pants. Cause the keyboardist and lead singer from Styx wears those tight, tight, tight, tight...*ahem* pants. Actually, guys, you may not know it but tight pants are a turn on for women. So throw the Gunker (goth/punk/skater) pants away and follow the path of your new leader: David Bowie!

        Your soul is OPEN-MINDED. Although you do have strong opinions and make decisions, you never make them without thinking first of not only everything that is, but those that may not be as well. People trust that you'll willingly hear them out and understand when they tell you something, and you are well-liked for it. You are often the mediator in disputes and your desire to do what is right overcomes all else. You are an understanding and admirable soul.    urlLink   What Is Your Soul's Trait?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Well, I'm done. My hair has a blue shine to it...very nice. I'm gonna give it a copper shine when school comes around. My mom loved me being a blonde (I dyed it that way at first so that my hair would be light enough for the blue to show) so much that she got a prof. photographer to take my picture with my hair. I DIDN'T WANT TO BE A BOLNDE! I DON'T WANT TO BE A MINI VERSION OF MY MOM! So I went ahead and dyed my hair blue myself. Of course, my mom cried...but then she got mad. And so now I'm grounded...no tv...no IMing...no internet period...wait....uh....just be quiet about this OK? Shh!!!!

      Ok...I've dried my hair and the highlights actually look grood. The next step is the blue dye. It looks so good that my mom is now crying about me dying it blue. I guess my mom always wanted me to be a blonde like her. Her excuse for me not to do it is that she hated my school photo so much that she's gonna make me re-do it tomorrow and she doesn't want me to have blue hair for it (meaning she doesn't want to accept the true me). Well, ya know what, I don't care! It's the summer and I won't be able to have my hair blue during the school year. I'm not wasting another day of waiting for my blue hair! I'm doing it now! It's time to get out the blue....

      Well, nothing happened yesterday except later on in the day I saw Michael Moore's new movie, Fahrenheit 9/11 with Dougie and his sister (Hope). It was a really depressing movie. How the hell did we get stuck with this government? The hardest parts were where they showed the scenes from the Iraq war, cause the whole time I was thinking to myself, "Drew's gonna be in the air force. I really hope that he doesn't have to go through any of this. I don't want him to leave!" :(

      That was the greatest concert I've ever been to...ever! Ok, Peter Frampton was amazing on the guitar. For those of you who love the guitar I sujest you listen to one of his songs. But, STYX IS THE GREATEST BAND!!!!!!! I know most of you expected Styx to be old and crippled by now, but it has been more than 4 decades ago since Styx started (so they must be in thier late 40's, early 50's, or late 50's) but they were dancing around up there jumping over the equipment, doing highkicks, and sound exactly like they were in their 30's! Their voices even sound exactly the same! The person who played the keyboard (and did a lot of the lead singing) is officially my new hero. He's also really amusing. Randomly in the middle of the concert he turned to the rest of Styx and said, "Well, we know you can rock, but can you...rag-time?" And he started playing rag-time on the keyboard and everyone on stage started square dancing. And all of Styx was steaming hot, with their tight, tight, tight, tight pants, esp. the keyboardist who had the tighest pants of all, and...well, I'll just stop there, for all of your sakes. It was awsome though, cause at first we had these really good seats, but the controls were right in front of us and the guy working it was standing right in front of us. We asked for better seats, and we got our own booth! The audience mainly consisted of beer belly, balding with long hair (that they probably grew out just for this concert), men that desperately needed to shave and brought thier wives (and really small children) along. The strange thing was, I didn't see anybody my age there. They were all either men and women and their really small children. I felt alone, but that was ok, I still had a great time. I saw a few guys around 18 years old (which was the closest to my age I saw) kept on passing the booth and winking and looking at me. I mean, they weren't horrible looking, but I knew it was just becasue they would either have to settle for me, or one of the Nas Car dad's sluts in thier 50's. There were a lotta drunk people. The guy in the booth in front of us was either on drugs or REALLY drunk (I think it was drugs). He kept dangling over the back of his seat and rolling his eyes and would sometimes curl up in a ball because the noise was too loud for him. Meh...The woman in the booth behind us though, was REALLY drunk. She had his high-pitched nazal voice and kept screeching into our ears, "Play Lorelei!!" Yes it is a good song but it was getting to my head...I'm kinda glad that they never played that song, just to piss her off. 3 songs I wish they played that they didn't: The Best of Times, Lorelei, and Mr. Roboto (I didn't care so much about the last one). Oh, and I got a Styx Tour t-shirt! :) In the end I lost my sense of sight (because of the blinding show lights and from leaving my glasses on so long), my sense of hearing (from the huge speakers and Styx is a loud band), my voice (from all the screaming and singing), and I lost my entire sense of sense...wait a minute...Besides all the drunk people...the Styx concert was the greatest...all because of the keyboardist with those tight, tight, tight pants, and those...*ahem*...sorry...I shall conclude with... STYX ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! http://www.styxworld.com/    Come Sail Away   I'm sailing away, set an open course for the virgin sea I've got to be free, free to face the life that's ahead of me On board, I'm the captain, so climb aboard We'll search for tomorrow on every shore And I'll try, oh Lord, I'll try to carry on   I look to the sea, reflections in the waves spark my memory Some happy, some sad I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had We live happily forever, so the story goes But somehow we missed out on that pot of gold But we'll try best that we can to carry on   A gathering of angels appeared above my head They sang to me this song of hope, and this is what they said They said come sail away, come sail away Come sail away with me Come sail away, come sail away Come sail away with me   I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise They climbed aboard their starship and headed for the skies Singing come sail away, come sail away Come sail away with me Come sail away, come sail away Come sail away with me

      It didn't work on my dark hair, I need to highlight my hair first...I'll do that tomorrow (hopefully before the Styx concert). In my desperate attempt to get my hair blue, today in my art class I took my beige ( for the people who don't know what it is, it's light blue) sharpie and colored a strand of my hair blue without highlighting it first. Surprizingly, it worked out really well and stands out, but it partly dried out my hair. I dunno yet if sharpie washes out of hair. If not, I'll dye over it cause it a lighter blue than the dark blue dye from Hot Topic. Well, I shall try again tomorrow night. My advisor on my hair dying is Brian, the councelor from art camp. He's actually a Gunker almost and, like Sporko, has dyed his hair many times and also wears the same Gunker pants that Sporko has from Hot Topic (except they're blue and black with skulls instead of red and black with stars). I also drew him in those pants when he posed as a rock star on Wednesday with his electric guitar. Tomorrow is the last day of portrait camp but I'll be back to camp the 14th or 17th or something like that for the landscape class (Brian will be there again). Well, wish me grood luck on my hair and the concert.

      Well, it is time, and I have to admit that it hasn't turned out exactly the way how I hoped it to be (but that always happens when you have to consult the parents about it). In my hands I am holding a bottle of temporary (3 weeks) dark blue hair dye I purchaced at Hot Topic today. It is a scary moment...for I am trusting my mom in this procedure to help me *shudder* but I believe it will be worth it (or be a complete disaster). I must go walk down the long hallway to the bathroom of new beginnings...*erie music playing*... Oh, and by the way, I broke the front door window trying to get into the house today...now then, as you were...*erie music once again playing*...

      few days ago... I sleep over at Alex D.'s...Evan was gonna stay too but he had to go to the beach the next morning. We watched the Rockie Horror Picture Show...wow, I have to say wow...you won't find more transsexuals in one movie. I can't get that song outta my head!... It's just a jump to the left, And a step to the right! Put you hands on your hips, And shake it all right! What am I saying?! I'm scaring myself... But man, that movie sent us into a crazy frenzy...we ran outside and started going into seizures and crazy dances...personally I thought Alex was gonna kill himself. Behind all the madness, the fields looked really awsome with all of the fireflies and there were millions. And the fact that a mile away someone was blasting Enya and it temporarily calmed us... The next day my mom signed me up for Karate...I'm gonna kill myself...

      Had an uneventful Father's Day...we're gonna go out for sushi tonight...On the bright side, My mom's 1st art class strats tomorrow at Yellow Springs studio. It's gonna rock cause it's gonna be Tori, Nicki D., Alex D., Taylor, Dopugie, 10 complete strangers, and me (sorry if I forgot anyone) and we're gonna actually DRAW and hang around the creek! But right now, I'm just having fun listening to Eric on the TED blog from that one day I was there...*FLASH BACK!!!!!!!!* and I had nothing to do (I dunno even why I was there, my mom just told me the morning that I was going to Dopugie's house and I didn't know why)...*BACK TO CURRENT TIME!!!!!!!* Those were some odd times...well, I'll update about tomorrow iwth all of the coolness...

Besides all that...I'm really bored... I'm at the point where I'm ready to eat to entertain myself but I haven't eaten yet today. Must resist the Potato chips! So hungry... I'll do sumthin lata...

      I went to a Dido concert last night at the Tower Theater. She is amazing. Actually I didn't knwo anything about Dido until I went to this concert. Fortunately, I found me saying to myself, "Wait, Dido did that song? Wow." So I could at some parts sing along. I got a t-shirt. Very cool. Overall it was a nice calm concert and she wasn't all fancy like Britney Spears changing her costume 5x's each song and using props like snakes. It was very enjoyable. Ok, now for the amazing news....   I AM GOING TO A STYX AND PETER FRAMPTON CONCERT JUNE 25TH!!!!!!   Well, I actually don't know anything about Peter Frampton but maybe it'll be another Dido experience. I am going for the Styx, one of my favorite bands. It'll be at the Mann Music Center in Philly, and I'm going with just my dad (so sorry friends, unless something happens to my dad, I can't take you.) We'll be about 20 seats or something like 100 yards away from stage which I think is pretty good. Anybody know anything about Peter Frampton?

      Went to Tsylor's again today, was fun. We rented the first two American Pie movies...yay! The first was grood, we didn't get to finish the second but we'll do that tomorrow. Interesting movies I must say, but now officially after that movie, I'm giving up my life long dream of being a pie...forever.... Ok, Michelle and Jennifer from A.P. are awsome! I think I'm more like Jen than Michelle but, whatever. Eric's voice sounds so different over the phone...even more different than Taco's...

      WOOOOOOOHOOOOOOO!!!!!! I've escaped out of the darkness!!!! The depesssion is over! Sigh! And to think it is all because of...Taylor. I called him this morning and it all worked out fine! We (Taylor, DREW, and I) went to Exton Mall (gotta shirt @ Hot Topic and $40 of candy and Chinese, and they didn't have the Nightmare Before Christmas anywhere!), then his house (tried to kill Sims and had water baloon fights inside), then we drove around wondering what we would do next, then it hit me to go to the Quarry but we were far from their house so.... I GOTTA DO BATHINGSUIT SHOPPING WITH THEM AT EXTON MALL! I know some people (like...um...maybe Emily?!) would kill to do that. Then we went to my house, got my bathingsuit, and we went to the Quarry. Felt great to be in the water. Then they left and I watched Underworld (odd movie). I've now been inspired to make plans all week! I don't have any free day this week now! Wahooo! *dancin dancin dancin* Depression is gone! IT'S OVER! hmmm...I think I'll rent all of the American Pie movies this week...

      Wow, this is really sad...All of my friends are away so instead I'm spending my time over a celebirty obsession of Craig Nicholls, or as I like to call him CN, (the crazy lead guitarist and singer of The Vines) who looks like he's stoned...but..oh well. He looks just like that guy from the movie Deer Hunter who kills himself in the end. It's so sad...Every day I'm moving further and further away from my true love, John Mayer. OH JOHNNY, DAMN YOU! WHY WON'T YOU COME OUT WITH A NEW CD SO I CAN FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU AGAIN?! *Sniff* So sad... Oh there's also the person, who's number is on my skirt (special thanks to Eric and Cimmie for putting it there). Well...ya, Taylor's number is on my skirt...but I memorized that number anyway so I guess that part doesn't refer to what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the OTHER number... Anyway, for all of you Vines lovers out there (like myself). Here's the most amazing music video ever!!!!!!... Ride...(I'm lazy so just cut and paste this in the address box yourself)... http://www.nme.com/features/107518.htm  Just in case you feel like singing along...  Ooh ah That's the start the middle and the end Aren't you glad the universe pretends  If I don't get this message home Once again I'm gonna hate alone  Ride with me (2x) Ride with me Ride with me Oh  Thought a lot ingnored the right to be Lie me down because we like to see  The colors through your loaded mind Fuck the world and liberate our time  Ride with me (2x) Ride with me Ride with me Oh  I'm not waitin' alone I'm not waitin' alone  Ride with me (2x) Ride with me Ride with me Oh

      I'm going through a depressing stage, I miss school. I feel incomplete without any work to do (and I still haven't found my reading list for Westtown) or my friends around. I can't eat, cause I'm depressed. I can't sleep cause I'm depressed. I was up until 2:00 last night thinking about my friends. Well, partly the reason why I was awake was because Frodo ripped apart most of my bed comforter. He also ripped off most of its sequints (I dunno, why don't you find out how to spell it?!) and I wasn't allowed to kick him out of my room or else he'd whine. It was either the bed comforter or Frodo. So in the end I decided to freeze my ass off for him. I'm also starting to get sick from this depression, which also kept me up at night. Somebody call me...home: 610-430-7880...cell: 484-832-5345...  or IM me...sn: eepedeep I'm so lonely...

      Nothing has happened today really. My friend, Erin D. (who's goin to Moore College next year), and I walked around West Chester to do this open studio walk. We got soaked and cold and we were at the point where we wanted to call one on the phone numbers Taylor and Cimmie/Eric wrote on my skirt to pick us up (which were only Taylor and Steve's numbers) but we decided to walk home. We watched Princess Homoyoke (I think that's how you spell it) which is created by the same creator of Spirited Away. Then she left and it was boring...i sat around flipping through channels...eating chips (which wasn't grood for shrinkin gut). I just noticed that the lead singer of The Vines is hot, although he looks stoned..but that's ok...so does Green Poncho Boy...  *Cimmie, Sydney, Eric: call me...thinkin of wednesday...

I LOVE YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      I was bored out of my mind this evening. I was so bored I ended up watching ellen, Opera, and Dr. Phil with my mom. While watching the ELLEN show my mom left the room. Halle Berry was the guest and she was explaining to Ellen this special Miss America walk (believe it or not she was at one point Miss Ohio). The point of the walk was to walk with one foot stepping directly in front of the other to somehow make your thighs look thinner. (?) So I tried to do the walk (cause I had nothing else to do) and in the end, in all of my situations, I ended up flat on my face...I guess I pulled a Georgia Nicolson...

      Besides the fact that I've no life this week :(...I'm leaving on Thursday to go to the Penn State Arts Festival til Sunday, and then as soon as I get home I must leave to Rehobeth (spell?) Beach for a week with Alexandra (she's comming home, yay!) Thus, I won't be taking the landscape class :( and I won't get to update my blog or IM any of you for 2 weeks!!! So sad....sorry...anyway....yesterday! *** 4th o' July was fun! Was at the D's for most of the day...most of it consisted of eating, and breaking sticks and throwing them out the window...yeah...Then at five we had to leave for the Mannix's. You have to understand that when I got there I was wearing my hair back tight, short shorts, and a tight top. I kinda scared everyoone there when I came downstairs changed in my baggy pants, my Styx shirt that was intended for an adult, and bearing all of my frizzy blue hair. When I came downstairs with my shirt a guy there named Bernie looked at my shirt (he works in the music record deal bussiness). Well, first he made a joke that I was too young to like Styx (I could tell when I went to the concert). Then he told me that that very morning he was talking with someone he works with who asked him if he wanted a signed photo of the lead singer of Styx who plays the keyboard (with the tight tight tight pants!!!) and he said no cause he thought no one would wanted it. Now he feels really guilty. But oh well...he turned out to be a cool guy. He gets to vote for the Grammy Awards. He found it facinating that I was interested in Classic Rock for my age. We ended up talking a lot about it. In the end, he sujjested that I listen to Pink Floyd. I'll try it... When am I gonna get thses drawings on my blog????

      ...it was horrible. It was basically a soap opera with special effects and action scenes. The action scenes were amazing. The Green Goblin's son was hot. Doc Ock is not my most favorite villain of all time... Gabo's 3 Most Fav villains of all time... 1)  Doc Ock  (who also plays the character of Frida's husband in Frida) from Spiderman 2 2)  The Goblin King*  (played by David Bowie!!!) from Labyrinth ...and who can forget, the transexual... 3)  Dr. Frankfurter  (who also plays the lead Pirate in Muppet Treasure Island and the guy who gets his arm chopped off in Charlie's Angels) from The Rockie Horror Picture Show.  Please take note: *This is the only case where I will say that a man has worn his pants too tight. Please don't ever do that again, Bowie. You could see EVERYTHING!

      I was thinking to myself, "What would be my worst nightmare?" Well, I have two: 1) Dying alone. Not dying alone as in dying single, but literally dying ALONE with no one else around you to care. 2) Becoming a homemaker. I think that's the saddest thing that could happen to me. Kinda like Eowyn from LOTR, who felt being a woman (during those times) ment being trapped in a cage. I guess for me, my cage is being stuck at home cleaning the house all day. I just hope I don't marry the type of person who'll make me do that.

      I got 5 teeth pulled today so that I can get braces by Thursday. There aren't any teeth to put them on! The laughing gas really got to me. It was just like that episode of the Simpsons where Lisa got braces and got laughing gas. I started seeing double all the time...Then whenever they put a needle of novacane in my mouth the people who were working on me would say, "You will feel a sight pinch." Then the scene would freeze in front of me and some silver spirals would appear below their faces. The whole tiem in my mind I kept hearing a voice (prob my inner self) singing, "I'm on the Simpsons! I'm on the Simpsons! I'm on the Simpsons!..." and so on. It was a weird experience a lot of the time it kept playing the one scene where Lisa dreams about The Beatles, from the laughing gas, in my mind. All that I could remember from the actual procedure was getting the weird needle dream and the pulling of the last two teeth. When I got home, I felt like a chipmunk...I hate being numb...I lost feeling in most of my face...including my ear. Now that's over...I gotta lotta Tofutti (tofu ice cream) and sweet potato mush...AlexD suggested I drank liquid prime ribs **shudder**. Great, now I have to go through the pain all over again for braces on Thursday...
