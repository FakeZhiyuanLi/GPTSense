      Beware, prepare, beware, prepare!  the world is coming to a start!  will you define it with science  or create it with art?   do you just bow to it in prayer  when Spring bursts into the air?  still, can't you see the end-of-world gloom?  the certainty of mushroom cloud doom?  but do you threaten the world with hope?  you really buy that illegal dope?  should you handstand in the street  asking danger to a merry meet?  or step off the cliff and fall into love  it's as good down here as it is above.   but whatever you will,  whatever you may  start the world new  on April Fool’s Day!

      Subject: Ivieee's picks thru June  Date: Tue, 18 May 2004 18:47:45 +0000             Okay, there is more! You asked for it! Well, some of you did, anyway...  I don't know if I can make it to this one, but watch out for these girls, The Queen of Spades! All-girl 60's surf, and their next show is Wed. the 19th @ 9:30 in this new place, The Pyramid, a mediterranean restaurant on 6th at I35, where the Empanada Parlor used to be. They will also be at Beerland on Sat. the 29th at 4pm, but I for sure can't make that... Karen Biller is their most formidable drummer, and her other surf band, the Undertakers is one of my faves.  Here are my boys. The Alice Rose. I never miss them if I can at all manage. This is a new venue for them, and me. Bigsby's on 6th, at 11:30pm. I'll be there for sure. They were SO ON at The Red Eyed Fly last Friday, but its kind of hard to dance on that flagstone patio.  On Sat. the 22nd is a fundraiser for Pagan Pride Day that they are calling Hot Licks & Hot Luck, at the Vortex 2-7pm. Guy Forsyth is the main entertainment, and there is a hot sauce contest. I will be boothing with my hulaballooz, doing the Hulah Foolah thang, and some other craftiness from me, Sarah, and Natural Magic. I love vending at the Vortex, I just throw everything on my wheelbarrow and wheel it there! Then on to Natural Magic for the Typsy Gypsys fire and bellydance show, free, 8 - 10pm.  Monday the 24th is a 9:30 show for the Undertakers, heavy surf rock, at room 710. It is "New Band Night" and so i don't think there is a cover charge. But they are NOT a new band, and if they are anything as good as last year's shows, you will find me way down front getting wiped out by the undertow!  Todd Rundgren is at La Zona Rosa on the 25th, Tuesday, and Sharon and I are going...Everyone thinks of him as old hippie music, and I ain't got nothin wrong with that, but the man really knows how to KEEP UP, and I have no idea what he has been up to lately.  Pong is at Emo's on that busy 22nd of May, but I think we will hold out for a more chill venue with better sound, and that would be the Carousel Lounge, Friday the 28th. Excellent dance floor there, too, you wiggly girl!  Moving into June,   Is anybody doing 1st Thursday on the 3rd? Me and my hoops are looking out for a ride. The wheelbarrow won't work for this gig. o}O  Then, at last! we have The Golden Apples on Friday the 4th at a very downhome bar, Trophy's. I will bring incense this time. If you haven't seen TGA, just do it this time. They just do not have an off night, totally pro power pop, and they do not get the crowds that their talent deserves.  If I'm worn out by then, I will just have to go get a talkin' to about staying power from Patti Smith on June 18th at La Zona Rosa. She will definitely not let me get away with that "I'm too old for this" shit!  Will I actually do all this? I don't think I can afford to! But I sure do love having all these great choices, and esp. if you call me or e me and say YOU are going, I will probably say see you there! And if you want I'll let you know if something good pops up at the last minute, like a Tumbleweed Racer, Black Novas, or Beecher show. And keep those reports coming in!  Cheers,  Ivieee

      Or: Why To Bookmark Snopes on Your Browser  Okay, friends, Snopes had researched the quotes given in that email and determined it to be True, BUT pretty much all taken out of context including historical context. They have provided all of the quotes surrounded in big chunks of the context so that you can see the caveats and qualifications. So I guess I have to take back what I said about the dems (at least the ones quoted) being as warmongering as Bush.  www.snopes.com/politics/war/wmdquotes.asp  Snopes didn't make any guesses about who the anonymous author/editor was, but I would guess a rep. thinktank/opinionmaker. I suspected it was a hoax primarily because of the "Send this to everyone you know" tag at the bottom.  Sometimes I wonder if the hoaxmakers themselves go to Snopes when they are feeling low on inspiration!  Ivieee  (Above written as "Reply to All" in response to the anonymously written mass email below. When I get hoaxes forwarded to me I tend to look 'em up on Snopes and do a "Reply to All" to set the record straight. Obnoxious to the people on the mailing list who don't know me? Maybe. Just doing my part to "TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT THE PRESIDENT LEADING US TO WAR" in this case. If you get bored with the quotes just go on down to the bottom.)  WHERE BUSH GOT HIS MARCHING ORDERS  "One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them.  That is our bottom line."   - President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998      "If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear.  We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program."   - President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998      "Iraq is a long way from [here], but what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face."   - Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998      "He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983."   - Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998      "We urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs."   - Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sen’s. Carl Levin (D-MI), Tom Daschle (D-SD), John Kerry ( D - MA), and others Oct. 9, 1998   .....(I delete a whole lot of quotes for the sake of brevity)....  "Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation.. And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real."   - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan. 23. 2003      -----------------------------------     SO NOW THESE SAME DEMOCRATS SAY PRESIDENT BUSH LIED, THAT THERE NEVER WERE ANY WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, AND THAT HE TOOK US TO WAR UNNECESSARILY!      TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT THE PRESIDENT LEADING US TO WAR.      Send this to everybody you know. The networks won't do it.  It's up to us to get the word out.

      LoverMan and I went to the beach, a little minivacation which is all we can afford right now. One of the best beaches on the Texas Coast is the Padre Island National Seashore. We camp on North Beach, near the Malachite Visitor Center.  Now maybe a couple of months, I got a note from an old Earth First! bud that the National Parks Service was opening up Padre to drilling. At the time I had no response/reaction capability, nor do I now, but I forwarded his message to LM, who is a member of the SurfRiders Foundation, a beach watchdog and service nonprofit for water sports enthusiasts. LM in turn asked SurfRiders what they were doing about it, what they thought, and they were not up-to-date enough to know what was proposed or do anything about it. Before anyone knew what was up the comment period was over and a permit had been issued and they are now drilling and extracting on the Island, our best, cleanest beach in Texas. I am pretty sure it is for natural gas, and that the reserve there was enough to supply the whole nation for one day.  So I was curious as to how this would look on the beach, from a camper's viewpoint. We didn't go down to try to see the actual operation, too far down the beach, we don't have 4 wheel, so we wimped out. But, the main impact that we could tell is the traffic. 7 in the morning: rumble of a convoy of 18-wheeler sized heavy machinery of varying sorts, and big tanks. 10 or so in number, and in front and in back a little dune buggy with a guy wearing neon. Then, all through the day, smaller convoys of one or four or five machines, each trip always accompanied by the two dunebuggydudes, one in the lead and one behind. It was just very surreal, the effect was one of a miliarized, occupied feeling in an otherwise natural beach scene.   What were the two dunebuggydudes for? They drive the same beach-golfcart thingees that the Parks Service Turtle Patrolers drive, so my thought is that the contractor must have agreed to hire turtle watchers, as a mitigation, to make sure that the big trucks didn't squash any endangered sea turtles. LM said he got the distinct impression that the dunebuggy drivers were more about protecting the machines than turtles. In case you were an environmental terrorist or surfer who might want to attack the big bad oil company.  They DID look at us closely. And smiled and waved. And every truck driver in every convoy smiled and waved, I was pretty sure it was company policy. Mitigate the fucking turtles, sure, whatever, but make DAMN sure you mitigate the public opinion. Smile and wave at every camper and sunbather and fisherman, or you're fired.  If that was the case, I bet it is/has been effective. The first morning we even heard campers tooting their horns in greeting. Toot Toot! Hey we got 18-wheelers on the beach now, but they sure are friendly! Hell, they're just going to work like anyone else, and here I'm just drinkin beer on the beach! I'm just glad my brother-in-law has a job now so my sister don't have to pay for everything. Running out of oil and natural gas? Well we're gonna be glad we have that extra day on down the line. Toot! Toot!

      There was this cartoon, something B. Kliban style, that I have never forgotten! Just two panels, each a cartoon section of the human brain, one male and the other female. On the male side the brain was divided amongst: sports (the biggest part), work (a subset of sports), beer, sex (the second largest part) and, as a small part within sex, The Relationship.   The female brain was similarly divided, with, of course, shopping being the largest portion. Second largest was The Relationship, the within that, sex as a proportionately smaller subsection. No surprises, except for a distinct portion of the brain dedicated to "Having to Pee."  Which of course was the whole joke, at least from the point of view of a woman looking at the cartoon!  My old girlfriend J once told me NOT TO HOLD MY PEE, as all of us girls do on a regular basis because really we DO have to pee more often than we are presented with socially acceptable occasions to do so, because, she told me, holding your pee hurts your courage.  At the time, there was no place in my mind to process such an allegation, possibly because The Relationship was taking up too much space.  Holding your pee hurts your courage?? What kind of talk was that? Until, much later, did I look at the connections between adrenal function (which is what courage is made of) and renal function (which is where pee is made). If you hold your pee, what your body understands is that a frightening situation is in effect, such that if you took the moment to pee, your life might be in danger. You are prepared for fight or flight, no time to drop your panties! But, because of shame, a false sense of danger is given, because there is no safe, private, shame-free place to pee, or even just the possibility that someone will know that you are going to pee makes you hold it. So women are always in a subliminal state of fear and of having to pee.  One of the recent times I felt this pressure was at Barton Springs, on the south side, in the Dog Park end of the springs. So, I swam in the dogpoop end of Barton Springs, then didn't change out of my wet swimsuit and didn't pee because those things were inconvenient. So guess what, I got a bladder infection.  NOW talk about having to pee! Only you go to do it and you get a dribble, and you still have to pee! Piss!  UTI's are usually treated with antibiotics. Unfortunately, antibiotic treatments, especially if relied on sequentially, make you more subject to E. coli infections in general. So even Prescriptions for Nutritional Healing recommends that a natural approach to fighting UTI's is best. Save the antibiotics for tuberculosis or something.   And sure enough, if I take my UTI Tea formula, and some Colloidal Silver, my having to pee problems are vanquished.  UTI Tea: one part marshmallow root, two parts horsetail(aka shavegrass) and three pars uva ursi. Simmer a palmful in two mugs of prified water for 5 minutes, then drink this tea on an empty stomach 4 times a day.

      Okay, I just got back from the Patti Smith concert, and what I will say of my rock goddess' performance: it was okay. Firefly and I did'nt go way up front, like we usually woulda, maybe that had something to do with it, or all of us being so old. I love Patti Smith, I really do, but the best show she's done lately was a free show at Waterloo Park few years ago, just before Gung Ho. Haven't gotten the new album yet.  But! The new species which of which I have now seen two representatives, right here in my own very permeable home! It is shaped like an American cockroach, but about 3/4 of the size. It is a roach of some sort, but just because of it's different coloration, and its mellower temperament, and obviously not being a cockroach, I choose not to smash it. Its wing covers (elytra) are sandy grey-brown, with darker speckles. And the elytra don't lie as closely pressed to the thorax, giving the critter a lighter, fluffier appearance. A lot of which I find disturbing about cockroaches (German or American) is their spazzy motion - the scurrying and the flying-at-your-head. This new species has mellower movements, as if it has not been subjected to the evolutionarily selective force of millions of swats over thousands of generations, to have the erratic, hyper-evasive manouevers of the pest roach species.  It reminds me, of when I used to be a produce-slogger at Wheatsville Food Coop for so many years. If there ever was a bug in the store, an employee would call on the PA system. I was defacto, the HUMANE bug removal point-person. My boss, MC, once defended leave the spiders that inhabited the light fixtures over our workspace, because they caught and ate flies, which are know to carry human pathogens. I was so proud of her. But one day, in a box of bananas from Guatemala, a live critter crawled out which was exactly the size and shape of an American cockroach, but because it was bright spring green, with a white running-stipedown its side, nobody found it to be disgusting. "Pretty" was even mentioned, and as I released it into the garden, it went with best wishes from many of the staff.

      We have a few moments here, which may stretch into five or ten years, where many of us are able to see what is coming down the pike, but the impact has not arrived. So we can afford to think about the sorts of things in a not-panicky way, but be fully motivated . The end of the petroleum age is upon us, and what do we do when oil-driven systems fail?  There is a really interesting e mag I'm starting to read, called "From the Wilderness." It deals with Washington politics, primarily, but it is looking into the future and taking peak oil into acccount. D-Fly, I thought you might be interested in this article http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/061504_call_action.html which is calls for submissions on how we can ease the transition into a post-petroleum world. Microliving and microconsuming would probably be a big part of it.  I just found my primer on consensus decision-making process, "Democracy in the Raw," I still think it is one of the best essays/how-to's on the topic. I should send it in, who knows? Maybe feudal gang-rule will win as we fight over the last canned food, but maybe neighborhoods and regions will decide to organize themselves more fairly in order to deal with needs and scarcities. Just maybe. Look for the rainbow.

      Trailer Park Girl gave me permission to add posts retro-actively, and alter the date to suit the posting, so I have done a bit of time travelling. For example, at the very bottom of this blog I added a poem written on April 1st, and made the date of posting reflect that.  Past and present have been crossing paths for me lately. This does happen periodically in my life, and probably in yours too, so it doesn't freak me out too much. In my main case here, an old girlfriend showed up and left me a note at the shop, letting me know that her mother was in poor health and needing a visit from me. This lady, LD, was in fact a very big influence on my writing, being an author of short stories of edge-walker semi-biographical nature. We were arrested together the first time I got busted for an Earth First! protest. When she held the Dobie-Paisano fellowship and lived out on the ranch, I got to connect in a life-shaping way with Barton Creek, a chapter of my life not to be reopened for nearly 7 years later as my main Earth First! avocation. So her coming back into my life now that I've taken up this writing thing is fitting.   None of this was on my mind when, for seemingly no reason at all, this morning I pulled on my old purple Earth First! shirt, then ran into my old lover S, literally in the intersection (crossroads), who has just moved in down the street from me. I stopped in to tell him about LD, and to see what he knew, since he was the one who introduced us in the first place. He had heard about her health crises, and told me about the death of her man, and suggested, "Maybe she needs some love."   Well, yes, of course that is what we should do. S knows where she lives, and has a car...  Later on tonight another friend B looked at my shirt and quipped something about it being in honor of the anniversary, which went over the top of my head. Then later he informed me that it was the one-year anniversary of the conviction of a man, purportedly and Earth First!er, for burning SUV's and Hummers, and that a warning had been issued that Earth First! might make stikes against SUV's in honor of the anniversary of this man's conviction! Look, if I got this story all screwed up, it's 'cause I don't watch TV and wasn't even listening too good when B told me. I swear, its just coincidence that I wore this shirt! Still, I was more than a little paranoid on the way home, esp. considering the bit of time I planned to spend after midnight at my favorite (and very monitored) railroad crossing!  The other time-looping thing started some days ago, when I found a copy of a manual I wrote for the budding anti-corporate pro-democracy movement, a primer/how-to for groups to use facilitated consensus process, which I still believe could be made to work for a self-governing people. I will post it (in the past, naturally, like 1996) because everyone should know how to do this. It could become useful in the post-petroleum future. "Democracy In The Raw: Consensus Process for Facilitated Meetings," it's called. When I found it I thought of B, who was in Atlanta at the time, doing the work that is in continuum with the groups I was working with when I wrote this piece. Hmm, I wrote this on assignment after a conference that took place in Chicago, which is where my LoveMan is right now, he who drives an SUV, so see, I ain't goin' to be burning any, even if I am wearing an Earth First! shirt! Because that SUV driver might really be a homeless civil servant who lives in hisorher car! End of coincidence!

      Remember the back-to-back entertainment schedule presented in "Ivieee's Picks through June?" Well, friends, I actually did go to see most of those shows and as a result of this and not having found a housemate soon enough, now I am a poor girl again who cooks at home and writes for entertainment. I did not even read the Chronicle because of the dangerous enticements to pay cover charges that might be contained therein.  HOW-ever,   I did see the new Harry Potter movie, *in cape* and *with wand* of course! My goal is to see it on the big screen 3 more times, so give me a call if you are going. And I will see Patti Smith this Friday! A birthday show for my girlfriend FireFly, and I imagine, a politically potent opportunity it will be. AND I got a sweet email from The Alice Rose tonight, thanking me and LoverMan (hereafter referred to a LM) for being such good fans and letting us know that things were going well in the studio and that they will be having some shows later on this month. I just hope that they are not during our beach trip, because yes, I am a crazy groupie fan of The Alice Rose, and so is LM, but wouldn't it be weird, sick, even, to alter your vacation plans to see a local band??? We just might be crazy groupie fans enough!  Further along in summer, and on through the fall, as of tonight I have committed myself to teaching a lot of classes, which tends to keep me off the street, and money coming in instead of going out. I teach classes on magic through the shop and as a part of Tejas Web, the local manifestation of the Reclaiming Tradition. So look for flyers around town or on TW's website, www.tejasweb.org or my shop's website, www.naturalmagic.us for more info.

      This Wednesday night is the dark moon. That means that the moon has been getting smaller for the past two weeks and on that night it is as small and dark as it gets until Thursday at 4:27pm, when the moon will start putting on weight again.  In magic, we take the clues the moon gives (the Doctrine of Signatures) and do workings of minimization, banishing, exorcism, making smaller, getting rid of, undoing, or if called for and we are prepared to accept the consequences, cursing.   On Wednesdays we are ruled by the influence of Mercury, the god of messages, diplomacy, science, chastity, and self-improvement, it seems like a good dark moon to get rid of negative things that involve irrational emotions, delusions, lies, misrepresentations, and bad communications.  See where I am going with this? Tomorrow night would be an excellent time to do workings to banish George W. Bush and the neocon religious right from power and the White House. My plan, and suggestion, is to do this every dark moon through the November election.  At the crossroads is the place for this sort of work. I like places where railroads cross roadways, myself.  We banish this seeming Dark Age No wrongful war do we wage. From power is George Bush relived And no more deceipts are believed. By November this administration is failed Bush and Cheney are run out on a rail. Polarization, misrepresentation at an end With democracy, tolerance and peace Just around the bend.  Perhaps you can do a better chant. I might, myself. Then, you walk away from the crossroads without looking back.  An excellent follow-up would be to, upon the New Moon, and I would recommend this Friday, do a working to call a new, beautiful awakening of peace and justice and reason, into the nation, a working with Iris and the Rainbow of Hope after the storm. Because you don't want to leave a power vacuum. Magic, like Nature, abhores a vacuum. I will be doing this at - YEAH! The Patti Smith show!!!  How will we imagine and build a country that would earn the respect and admiration of the world, a nation that could really help to minimize the suffering inevitable that we are heading for, the bottleneck of civilization? By which I mean the end of the Petroleum Age of Humankind, friends.

      I exchange email with a cousin of mine who lives “on the Mainland” (from the Galveston perspective). We love each other deeply, tho I am an arch liberal/radical and he is evidently a total Gulf-Coast variety neoconservative. Earlier in April this year we had an exchange about the war. It started with the spiders. You know, that doctored photo that went around in forwarded emails showing the “camel spiders” that soldiers in Iraq were encountering. Our actual text is in italics. Nevermind, this blogspot doesn't do italics.  COUSIN  (photo of spiders attached) Are these things for real?  IVIEEE (reconstructed approximately from memory) Hmmm, they can jump 15 feet, and run (at 20mph) screaming at your shadow. Cuz’n, did you know they took the word “gullibility out of the dictionary? Here’s what they say about camel spiders: (.......) But don’t take my word for it, go to Snopes.  COUSIN  No, I didn't go to snopes. I'll take your word for it. It's the reason I asked you in the first place. Doesn't matter, i ain't goin over there anyways. Fuckin place is flat full of shit i'd rather see dead than alive.So I'm teachin ya manners? Alright! Nice to know I'm good for somethin,lol! Later.........   (Now what does he mean by “shit,” spiders, camels, ... People? I had to ask:)  IVIEEE (reconstructed exactly from memory) Okay, so first we went there to find and destroy the weapons of mass destruction. Then we wer there to liberate the Iraqi people. But now we get down to the nitty gritty, we are there because we’d rather see them dead than alive? Just trying to keep up, here...  COUSIN  We? What's this "we" shit? Did I ask you to be like me? Think for yourself, kiddo! I don't need support for my opinion. Last I heard 70% of the little bastards thought there was nothing wrong with killing Americans. But, the funny thing is, I've heard from friends,(and relatives) coming back from there that a lot of them really appreciate what we've done for them and are really glad we came. No, not relatives of yours, these are my extended family. So, actually, turnin the place to glass with a nice nuclear device really is not an option. But as far as your little terroristic friends go, hmm, gee, I wish that had the guts to be as vocal as you.It would make things easier to distinguish those who should stay above ground and those who should be below.And don't give me that load about how they're fighting to preserve their religion and way of life.Their cause stinks worse than that fertilizer you use on your ganja plants. Asimilate them to youth here and you have a bunch of spoiled brats with more testosterone than brains too lazy to pick up a shovel and improve themselves and their way of life. No glory in that! Much better to blow up planes full of mothers, children and people who really do make a difference in the name of "Allah" . Basically no different than the crackheads we have around here.   (End of exchange.)  Wow, I was going to reply to this, made a couple of starts: "turnin the place to glass with a nice nuclear device is not an option? Because that would really make it hard to get the oil out!" I guess the raw hate and invective just pushed me so far back that I could not. I was stunned into silence, and I have not emailed him since. But I think we should remember that this is the family environment most of us exist in. I have surrounded myself with tolerant, liberal, multicultural people, but undiluted American hate is no further away than the next Thanksgiving gathering, for most of us. They are sticking with George Bush and Cheney, and they think it is America’s prerogative to stomp and kill other nations. In past discussions I have had to remind him that I was a family member who would be run out of the country if his proposed "love it or leave it political pogroms were actually carried out. But if you think my redneck neocon family is scary, just wait til you figure out how many fundamentalist christians really believe that George Bush was elected to bring on Armageddon so that they can get on with the Rapture.

      My LoverMan left for Chicago this afternoon, a work trip, then an air hockey tournament. We have been spending so much good time together that I am anticipating some lonesome nights where, instead of cleaning house or anything practical, I might just jump-start this bloggy thing since I will have many man-free hours on my hands. But since love is on my mind...  In my line of work, which is magic, making potions, and running my witchy shop, we get a lot of questions about love. How to get it, how to hold it, how to make it work. A lot of time is spent talking people out of casting love spells on people. The second big lecture Zarah and I give is how not to be taken advantage of in love, how to get out of "bad love." In fact, our usual advice is that matters of love are best worked on in mundane, non-magical methods. This is where a magic shoppe becomes a low-budget mental health resource.  It was not so long ago that I felt myself unqualified to give advice about love. After the end of a fourteen year love relationship, I had a couple of short-term flings, then headed straight for two very ill-advised love affairs that were very painful when I got dumped. After the second of these I wised up and stayed out of love and off the market for a full six months, during which time I figured out that I was a really cool chick who deserved good love or I wasn't having any of it. When I was ready to make a go of it again I realised that I had no clue, that after a 14 year romance, I was basically at the college-age maturity and street smarts about dating. In talking about this to my dear sweet ex, I found that he had come to the same conclusion, that he needed some professional advice! And went out and got some books, which he loaned me, in the nick of time.  Bad titles but wow! What an education! I was amazed and wondered, "Why don't they teach this stuff in high school?" Most of us waste a huge percentage of our productive, young adult lives getting into bad love or recovering from it. Nina Attwood, Be Your Own Dating Service, and Date Lines: Everything from Hello to I Do. Told you the titles were bad...  A few basics. One is: There is no such thing a a soul mate. Get over it! For each and every one of us, there are many, hundreds if not thousands of ideal mates with whom we can forge a rewarding relationship. For crying out loud, there are 6 1/2 BILLION humans now, so we can dispence with the scarcity issues. Almost every week, I work with someone who, because they believe so-and-so is their soul mate, flounders in pain, causing pain, trying to make a doomed relationship function with aforementioned "soul mate." I think that this feeling of "once in a lifetime" evolved from when there were not many humans to mate with, and we had few choices of mates. Maybe back then, before the huge population spike, you might have had to put up with a lot of misery from your soul mate in order to get laid and have a shot at reproducing. Not anymore. We can afford to be very selective, and to move on if the thing is not exactly what we want.  Second is: Do move on if your love isn't what you want and need, and the quicker the better, because of a human emotional process called "attachment." People get attached to people, and the more time spent, and the more intimate that time spent is, the more attached you become to that person, whether or not the relationship is rewarding and healthy, or hopelessly codependant and incompatible. Breaking the emotional bonds of attachment (what we call heartbreak) gets harder and harder the longer we stay in the nonfunctional relationship. So, say, that was fun but it won't work, bye-bye, no we can't just be friends.  Third is: Good love and rewarding, lasting relationships are based on a foundation of shared values and desire to be in the relationship. Shared values means you see eye-to-eye on things like politics, manners, lifestyle, boundaries, religion, morality. The big stuff. The "opposites attract" thing is a lie.  I know that I personally wasn't grown-up enough to qualify for any of thes things until I was close to forty. And by "grown-up" I mean mentally healthy, understanding who I am and that that was okay and what I want out of life and from a relationship to some degree of certainty, and figuring out that it was okay to ask for it.   That mentally healthy thing sure is the challenge for many of us, and I've told my customers that "True love is made possible by good mental health."

      I have trouble sleeping, and my logging habit may proceed forthwith. Tribute must be paid, for me even knowing about blogging, to my dear girlfriend Trailer Park girl, http://www.crossroads.net/jnazak/blog/ and she will have to be my first and main inspiration. Before her, I had never heard of this format, and not very subsequent, I was hooked on her writings, simple diary entries and musings in the theme of big ideas within a small-scale dwelling in the South Austin biome. StarrMusings and SloppyEnchilada are my only other blogger influences to date.  LIFEstyle, food, politics, religion, music, and love may turn out to be recurring topics if I manage to keep this thing going without sacrificing any of my other written goals. I only have so much time for writing, and I hope my projects don't compete, but compleate each other.  That said, here is just a bit of food and lifestyle, which happened tonight: A couple of years ago, my dear friend gave me a cauldron/hibachi/bbq grillthing which I parked on my porch, waiting patiently for a less brokenhearted period of my life. Sure enough, when romance stroked my tummy, the little rusted potbellied cooker came out. It immediately responded to love and hunger and a two-beer buzz, producing grilled portabella burgers, veggies, and now, grilled fish. "This thing is great! I'm delighted with its design!" said my LoverMan. Now we take it to the lake, in any cardboard apple box cluttering my kitchen, just in case a grill is not available, and now we might even turn up our noses at the county-park-provided cooking facilities in favor of the Majik Cowldron. And we spark it up in the front yard, amongst the weeds, as we did tonight.  But before you put something on the Cowldron, try this version of the Manhattan: 3 cubes ice, two jiggers Wellers bourbon whiskey, one jigger Nolly Pratt sweet vermouth, three splashes Angosura bitters, a thin slice of orange, skin bruised and squeezed, a big splash of the syrup of the jar of Maraschino cherries, and one cherry thereof. A very adult drink, but! how well it goes with anything vaguely Southern, BBQ'd or Cajun.  I asked my pal Grouper to report back to me which fish were ecologically and spiritually okay to eat, but until that study comes in, I take Doc at Wheatsville's recommendations and offerings. Very affordable among those was the Tilapia, which I put into a marinade of olive oil, lemon juice, bitter vermouth, Tony Chachere's, garlic powder, fresh lemon basil, TX tarragon, and lemon thyme. We started a fire of Cedar Elm twigs, offerings from my yard trees, then moving up to a few two-inch thick Pecan branches, which I pick up biking or walking home, whatever I can carry, because Pecan is so good for cooking on this little grill. Even though it is June in Central Texas, starting a fire in the front yard was pleasant, and what with the Shoo mosquito potion and the six sticks of SuperHit incense, even the monsoon-puddle-bred skeeters stayed a safe 10-ft radius around the cooker. We used the burning flames to reheat the leftover blackeyed peas and greens as sides. Once the coals were down, well it was two minutes on one side and 30 seconds on the other side for the Tilapia, barely enough time for me to make another Manhattan for LoverMan and me to go with dinner.  This might seen very gourmet, if we were not barefoot, or Martha Stewart if we were not so poor, or extravagant, if it were not so cheap and cooked on twigs from the yard!, shallow if it wasn't so eco, or degenerate, if it wasn't so healthy!  I like to imagine, how, after the oil crash, we could retain a few of these sorts of lifestyle and diet pleasure with simple modifications. The fish may be perch from my creek, or pigeons even, and the oil is sesame fom where we planted in what was the street. The greens and blackeyed peas grow real good here, if we bothered. Now the whiskey, we would need to import some expertise on that....

      Poison Ivy (Toxicodendron radicans) is "a shrub or climbing vine, older stems of vines fastened to trees by a dense growth of aerial rootlets and often climbing into treetops. Common to abundant in and at the edges of wooded areas, and containing an oil capable of causing intense itching and watery blisters through contact with the skin. Leaves variable in size, divided into 3 leaflets on an often reddish tinged petiole; the terminal leaflet symmetric, roughly ovate but lobed and toothed, larger than the lateral ones; lateral leaflets are asymmetric, lobed and toothed on the side toward the leaf base and usually only toothed on the opposite side, turning orange and red in autumn. Flowers greenish white, inconspicuous, in clusters up to 4 inches long. Fruit cream to white, sometime a dull yellow, spherical, about 1/4 inch in diameter, conspicuous on bare twigs in winter." -Brother Daniel Lynch, C.S.C., Native & Naturalized Woody Plants of Austin & the Hill Country  Poison Ivy and Poison Oak are folk names for the same plant, often used interchangeably and with much confusion, depending on the region. Poison sumac, a related species with five or more leaflets and growing as a shrub or small tree (though not in central Texas) is also often confused with Poison Ivy. East of Austin, in the Lost Pines, and further east, in the Piney Woods of east Texas and the southeast, there is a closely related species, Toxicodendron quercifolium, which could be more properly called Poison Oak, at least in Texas. ("Quercifolium" means "oak leaf" in Latin nomenclature.) Both local species, as well as several other Toxicodendron species in other parts of the continent, and Poison Sumac, have the same oil, urushiol, which is the substance that give Poison Ivy its most charming reputation. Urushiol oil is extremely potent: Only 1 nanogram (billionth of a gram) is needed to cause a rash, and  an average is 100 nanograms for most people. 1/4 ounce of urushiol is all that is needed to cause a rash in every person on earth! Specimens of urushiol several centuries old have found to cause dermatitis in sensitive people. 1 to 5 years is normal for urushiol oil to stay active on any surface including dead plants The word is derived from urushi, Japanese name for lacquer.  The reaction to urushiol is not a toxic reaction, it is a true allergy, differing from other skin allergies only in that about 80% of all humans are (or could potentially become) allergic to this substance! Like other allergens, it takes at least one exposure involving direct contact with the oil for a person to become sensitized; after the potentiating exposure/s, every contact begins a series of agitated immune responses resulting in the familiar rashes, blisters and oozing pustules.   Poison Ivy's message is specific to humans. Birds and other creatures eat the berries, and even goats and cows and deer at least incidentally browse the foliage, with no negative consequences whatsoever.  Brother Daniel Lynch points out that Poison Ivy is an edge species. She springs up at the edge of forest, like many other vines will do, to close in the forest, and to seal it off, if any disturbance has opened the canopy. This is why roadsides and even wide trails are favored habits of Poison Ivy. She guards the edges of the forest and says, "None shall pass!" (Unless of course they are the immune 20%) Another edge environment she frequents is waterways, and so she protects the erodable soils along creeks' and rivers' sides.  What is a warning to some can be a teasing invitation to others. If we heed Poison Ivy's message to tread lightly in these sensitive areas, if we know her face well enough to avoid direct contact with her body, she will often lead us to places of beauty seldom seen by two leggers. Once we have been initiated into this process, she may also lead us in other environs, where she does not grow in body, but wanders in spirit, into exquisite discoveries. Whenever we find ourselves wandering from one experience to the next unexpected, and then realizing that we are blissfully lost, we have hearkened unto her call.  Another of her lessons is the ability to discern between a thing and another that seems to be the same. By discerning the difference between her trifold leaflets and the trifold leaflets of the Box Elder, for example, or between the five leaflets of Virginia Creeper and the sometimes occurrence of Poison Ivy manifesting five leaflets, we can discern between reality and something masquerading as truth.  If we have learned that we are sensitive to Poison Ivy's message, our first inclination is to know how to recognize her in the wild. She is for many of us the first plant species we know how to identify, but, she hopes, not the last. She is the one who initiates us into plant identification, but she sees no reason that other plant species should not be known by name and reputation as well.  The receiving of wisdom is sometimes related to the reception of a poison, as in the poison of the Amanita Mushroom, or other poisons of hallucinogenic plants and animals. The serpent Priestesses of ancient Crete and other Oracles around the world have used the toxins of snakebite to receive visions and truths, and the bite of spiders is also similar to this injection of knowledge that is sometimes painful to the recipient. Likewise, the poison of Poison Ivy is correspondent with wisdom that, in this case, dawns painfully after the fact. Her teachings therefore speak to the gaining of insight and compassion through the process of Regret. Poison Ivy can help up with regret, loss, and grieving. She supports herself on strong trees in the forest, and so can we in times of need.  By the doctrine of signatures, according to which the appearance a thing reveals at least some of its true nature, Poison Ivy shows herself to be sacred to Hecate, who rules most of the baneful, toxic, and entheogenic herbs. "Leaves of three," each leaf seeming a bit like a beckoning hand, indicate the triple goddess, in this case this goddess of the crossroads, who monitors the choices in life that we make. If we find ourselves at a crossroads in life, with a difficult choice to make, perhaps Poison Ivy's link to Hecate can be availed. If we ignore her advice, well, it would not be the first time.  Poison Ivy makes a beautiful landscaping plant in situations where human access is unnecessary or unwanted. Her protective role in nature is perhaps an underutilized strength in urban neighborhoods. Back fences and property lines are natural places to plant Poison Ivy, where she could be a lovely wild backdrop to more formal plantings, especially taking into account the fall colors she provides. Any place overseen (but not overgrown) by Poison Ivy would be appropriate for the household pet cemetery or meditation nook. If you need to trim your Poison Ivy, simply wear thick plastic bags over your hands and trim into a plastic leaf bag, while uttering the appropriate prayers and obeisances. The trimmings will often root easily if deposited in appropriate habitats, perhaps those places in need of Protection, Truthfulness, Discernment, Wisdom, Compassion, or aid in the process of Regret. Planting Poison Ivy can be a truly revolutionary, enwildening action, politically, personally, and spiritually, and will certainly strengthen the bond between you and this powerful Plant Ally.

      I get asked, What is the Blue Moon good for?  The concept of the Blue Moon as being the second Full Moon in one month seems to date all the way back to the 80's. A defunct medeival definition had to do with getting rid of the 13th moon so as to keep the ecclesiastical calendar straight, so that moon-date determined holidays like Easter, etc., would stay at about the same solar time of the year. Songs and some legends seem to refer to rare occasions when things like volcano spew would make the Moon look blue to the eye.  So how to figure out what modern pagan observation should make of the modern definition, which happens about every 2 1/2 years? Look at some correspondences. Also, layering on more tradition is that this July's Blue Moon falls on Lammas or Lughnasdagh, the Irish/Celtic feast of Lugh, the grain harvest.  Blue: truth, throat chakra, blue faerie fire; Full Moon: maximum fulfillment potential; Blue Moon: rare, unusual, special occasion; Lughnasdagh: the sacrificial Corn God, usually associated with the harvest in temperate old world paganism, here in central TX the fact is it is the starting point for new fall crops and gardens. Lugh comes back in a Fall crop for us by mid-November, so maybe our cycle of fulfillment is quicker here!???  Traditional for Lugnasdagh is the baking of a Corn Man, which is passed around to take secrets to the underworld (confessions?) before he is sacrificed, usually not eaten eaten but buried.  How to weave this together? My suggestion is to use the Blue Moon power for special, even outrageouse requests, dreams and hopes of the biggest order, that we use our Throats, Voices to seng them into being, petitioning Lugh, god of light, the working man's god, craftsman, warrior. Perhaps a Cornbread Man of blue cornmeal could be infused with Blue Faery fire, and this blue fire could be used to animate our speaking of truth and dreams into being.  Many people feel very shy about using their voices, speaking their minds, much less asking for what they want. Those of us who are not shy about speaking have an obligation to help make safe place for them to practice.

      There is a rapist loose who has struck in my neighborhood, we are running out of oil, most of us are uninsured, and the leadership of this country has created a drunken bubble of cognitive dissonance that could really do anything evil in the name of God and the Apocalypse. Read a transcript of an old-style investigative journalist who puts the as-yet unrevealed horrific tortures at Al Ghirab that our country committed, in perspective with the neocon religious cultist stranglehold that the Bush administration has on this country.    urlLink http://www.pastpeak.com/archives/2004/07/post_1.htm    We really let ourselves slip into this situation when Rush Limbaugh went unanswered, I suppose. Which was enabled when Reagan lifted fair-time regulations on the media, if I remember my history accurately.   Now we find ourselves, less than two decades later, in a divided, polarized culture where people of different political perspectives do not even come into contact, except in the family. Where if I bring up a politically embarrassing fact to my right-wing cousin, he blasts out death threats to my "terroristic friends" and has jokingly referred to political pogroms to cleanse the country of left-leaning citizens.   When I point out to him that such a policy would result in me, a natural-born citizen and blood relative being deported or "disappeared" he will say it was just a joke. I think lots of "jokes" like this are being made in families nationwide. And of course the result is that we are given this mental picture, of being forced out of the country, or into some concentration camp, at gunpoint, while our&nbsp;relatives look on, saying, "We tried to warn you." If that image is not funny, and we do not laugh, we are accused of not having a sense of humor. I think a lot of mind control and self-censorship is being effected in this manner. We are afraid to speak out in public, afraid of ridicule from our relatives who have been coached in dismissive, disrespectful argument styles by Limbaugh for two decades. We don't know how to argue like that, and why would we want to, over Thanksgiving dinner? Turkey with a side of fear.

      I am SO sorry I blew it. I didn't tell you about the Typsy Gypsy's Bellydance show at Natural Magic OR The Alice Rose accoustic show at Flipnotics on Sat. the 24th. I would have let you know, but I couldn't go myself. I know, "Its all about me." Both of them were a blast, from reports and forensic evidence that even I could interpret.  But now to make up for it, here is something that is all about YOU. You and fun.  A not-to-miss show on Friday July 30th. The Golden Apples bring it back home to the Carousel Lounge. This is their only show for the rest of the summer. What with having a baby and making a new record, what more can we ask of these legendary pop rockers. My most-often fielded question about this band: "Was that a ZZ Top cover, or did they just make that up?" (Some folks think that song is by T Rex.) Why don't you ask them yourself?  Yes it is rounding up to be a Surf Summer, with Three Balls of Fire offering three shows to land-lubber Austin audiences. Guys, I couldn't blame you if you moved to California where a good rhythm and blues surf band gets its due. Thursday the 29th they apply the wax at the Hole in the Wall, then a big show at Antones on Sat. the 31st, but what I can't wait for is...  Sun. Aug. 1st at Egos, where Three Balls has rounded up some of the best (though few) surf acts in town, starting at 9pm with the Nematoads. Go to their website and look at the pictures, there is LM's knee! I guess I would call them New Wave surf, meticulous, precise, and quirky. I've only met them once but I think I love them! Of course how could you leave when a really cute all-girl surf band, the Queen of Spades is up next, with 60's vintage surf classics and originals that do honor to the era. Then when you think you are ready for more, the Undertakers will deal the death blow with power-chord heavy surf. If anyone (not of or related to the Undertakers by blood or marriage)&nbsp;can tell me what WWJPD means, I'll pay your cover charge or buy you a Tsunami, your choice. When you wash up on shore, Three Balls of Fire will be there to warm your bones with down-home Austin style guitar surf. This is a rare opportunity to sample some very diverse local surf styles in Austin. For a landlocked town we do have some excellent salty treats.  Maybe you don't surf, but you hula? I will be demoing stunts and offering hoops for sale&nbsp;at a fundraiser at Natural Magic on Sat. Aug. 7th. Since the monthly Hula Hooping Meetups are on first Saturdays, this will be our default hoopers meetup, starting at 5pm. There will be plenty of free-for-play hoops for all.&nbsp;Free music, local vendors, bellydance and firespinning demos, raffle&nbsp;and beverages will be available by donation for the fundraiser, benefiting Pagan Pride Day. Fun for kids, too!  See y'all soon, Ivieee  Keep It Up, Fool! ~o}0

      I caught a fish! Actually I caught two fishes, and set one loose because it was too small to eat.   LM caught a fish, too, about the same size as mine. AND you should have seen the one that got away!   I had my doubts about fishing. The last two times we went to LM's little cabin on the lake in&nbsp;East TX, I didn't catch anything, and neither did he. I started to call myself his "bad luck fishing charm" and wondered if my vegetarian-queasiness about killing, then cutting up those beautiful fishes made me a fit fisherman.   But for some reason I nudged us up from a nap that had gone on too long and we got our butts out for another try. He went straight to a spot on the lake where I'd never fished before. I had a top lure and a spinner, and he had a spinner and a rubber worm. Sometimes you want Tex Mex, sometimes you want Thai....   I think my top lure got the first bite, and it was easy to reel in, so we were not surprised that it was too small to keep. LM dealt with the unhooking - I was not quite there yet. Then, I saw him cast a short cast off to the side - not his usual M.O., but something BIG hit it immediately, and my great big lunky man was reeling for all he was worth! He struggled it to the side of the boat, and I was expecting it to be a big scary garr but no, it was a huge bass, at least five pounds if not seven. (Maybe y'all have seen the bumpersticker: VISUALIZE 5 POUND BASS.) LM said he was pretty sure he had never caught a bass that big, and as he tried to pull it out of the water I thought... and it did... the line broke and the big one got away. Carrying a spinner lure as a lip piercing ornament, now!   LM had seen it off to his side, swimming at the top of the water showing it's fin, like a whale breaching, so that's why he made the little side cast. We kept seeing this guy do that, which I had never witnessed before, so I nicknamed him "Brown Fin" and of course he was the the object of our sport from then on. Some kind of Ahab fever kicked in, I felt it myself! We even went back to the same spot the next day, and saw Brown Fin breach several times, but he wouldn't take a lure.   The consolation prizes were considerable. That evening we each pulled in nice pan-sized bass. LM again showed me how to fillet the fish the way his dad had taught him. His dad had learned it from his dad. True men's mysteries, which I am being taught. The first time he showed me, he prepared me for disapointment. "You'd think you'd get more meat from an animal this sized, but that's how it is. We feed the turtles the rest."   I am not ready to fillet my own fish. Again, the ex-vegetarian queasiness, mixed with, I'll fuck it up and waste the meat of this creature of God that I killed. So I let him do it for us, then asked if I could "mess around with" the fishes hacked up body. I was finding out what it felt like to cut through scales, and flesh, and try to avoid bones, and as a result, I added some sizeable extra chunks for us to fry! LM was very happy with my effort to get more from the fishes' sacrifice, and I may be up for trying to fillet next time, and sorry turtles, less for y'all this time.   This is no time for me to talk about vegetarian recipes, but the sides to this delicious, battered-and-fried fresh fish was dark green Laccinatto kale...and beets. Maybe you already know how to cooks greens, I will assume you do, but here is how I have converted about 85% of my friends who were beet-haters into beet lovers:   It must be Organically Grown beets of less than baseball size or don't even bother. I prefer them whole, but for the transitional beet lover, cube them into about centimeter chunks. Put them in a smallish pot and add water almost to the surface of the beets. Add about two or three tablespoons of apple cider vinegar per beet, and a few shakes of good olive oil. Simmer covered&nbsp;til the beets are tender. I love to add fresh Texas Tarragon, about 4 leaves per beet, about half way through the cooking.   This recipe also works for beets with the greens. Just add the chopped stems partway through the cooking and the chopped leaves near the end. I usually add extra vinegar (yes, it MUST be apple cider vinegar, and Braggs is the best) because, since beets are in the spinach family, the green parts contain oxalic acid, which is what kids hate about spinach. It is not so good for your digestion, and it binds up iron in your meal so that you can't absorb it. Vinegar neutralizes the oxalic acid, which is one reason it appears in so many spinach recipes.   Beets are very high in antioxidants. That color is an active ingredient! The whole root moves through your liver and gently cleanes it. The moist bulky roughage gives you the equivalent of a colonic cleansing, without poking anything up your butt. Warning: it will make your poop bright red! Don't let it scare you the next morning! It might even make your pee pinkish, but don't worry, I bet those anthocyanins are sweeping out the free radicals that collect in your kidneys, too.   And to top off that beet, they are dumb-easy to grow, and they grow well here for two seasons&nbsp;in Central Texas and its easy to save the seeds and they make beautiful plants. A total post-petroleum age survival food crop to know. Sorry, but you can't beet that!

      Spooky being my sole remaining feline companion, offers this story:   At first I thought it was my imagination. A lump or just a roll of fat? Within a couple of days it was big, feeling like a small hard-on through a pair of jeans. Then it was round and about three inches around, and thick. Time to go to the vet.   "Can I shave him?" asked Dr. M, and I nodded. Need to get a visual on this. Immediately apparent were the two fang marks at the top of the lump, just healed up enough that I could scrape off the last scabbing. "So it's just a cyst or infection from the bite, right, Doc?" "Hmmm, well, it could be, but..."   BUT he wouldn't promise me until after a biopsy&nbsp;that my cat didn't have cancer, a huge tumor which would set me prematurely catless, and I sure am not ready to give up my great white cat!! Not-tumor!   Even so, when we got home, I treated it like it was a cancerous tumor. Lots of love, and an Edgar Cayce-style castor oil pack. Basically I bandaged a castor-oil soaked napkin against the lump. Cayce used this treatment for any lumpy ailment, I think, whether cancerous or not. It penetrates tissue easily and softens and dissolves lumps of whatever variety.   Spooky thinks that Edgar Cayce is a quack, and maybe you do too. He jumped out the window with a big harrrrumphhh. About five minutes he returned, to show me that he had removed the bandage. When I felt his lump, it was still greasy, so hopefully SOMETHING was getting in??? Then he looked like he really needed a snack, just to ease the trauma, so I gave him a few kibbles and went back to whatever I was doing. Probably blogging.  Just a minute later, I started hearing cat-urrck noises. But Spooky is not a puker, believe me. This would be a first, that I saw! He looked me straight in the eye and ... urrrcked up a clear viscous fluid. No cat kibbles. Okay, I felt the urrck, and it was greasy...the castor oil! Somehow puked up around the kibbles that he wanted to keep in the GI tract!   So the castor oil got licked up and then puked out. I don't know if it was this therapy, nature, or the vet prodding and squeezing, but the next day, the lump on Spooky's side was noticeably smaller! And within a couple of days it was a figment of my imagination. Gone.  It reminds me of another spooky story about a lump in my left tit....'nuther story, nuther time!

      There is no way to excuse my sheer pleasure and enjoyment of life considering all the misery and starvation, war and despoliation globally, and national/regional economic and personal depression.  Perhaps I am in some sort of anomylous cyst that has somehow enclosed itself off from the toxicity of modern life. But if I was, how would I know about it?  Hopefully I am being given authority of this particular cyst, which is of my own invention, in order to preserve if not to perpetuate a lifestyle of wonder and sensual satisfaction, just to show the world that it exists, and could exist for many, if we were to limit our population to a sustainable level, and just avail ourselves of the simple enjoyments of the natural world while taking into reverence the limits of said world.  Would this all evaporate if the fossil-fuel-dependant vehicle of transportation that LM uses to transport us to Lake Travis ran dry of that black dinosaur-blood? Surely that blood will slow to a trickle before humans wean themselves from it.  In the meantime we say our prayers of gratitude, and make those deals with divinity in hopes that we have the ante. We go to Lake Travis, and LM sets sail on his windboard and I spin my hoops in ever more challenging cycles.  Sometimes we grill dinner out there. I have only recently come of age as a Texan with the grilling thing, but I think it could all be part of the sheer pleasure in life that we may all equilibrate to after the petroleum addiction is shaken. Is that so bad?  One day all these ingredients may no longer be available. This recipe for pleasure may go into my cyst, just for reference.  Free-swimming salmon. It really makes a difference, in taste as well as ecology and karma. Thaw it while you make this sauce:  Saute about 1/4 cup each chopped celery, red bell pepper, and onion in about 2 tbsp of butter. When the onions and celery are soft and near carmelized, add a few heaping tsp of capers. Add more butter if necessary, then 1/2 tsp of good Hungarian paprika, then the juice of 1/2 a lime and 1/2 an orange. Simmer til its all just a little thinner than pickle relish.  Grill or broil the salmon. Don't overcook it. After the first turn, spread the sauce all over it in a thick layer and cook just a minute&nbsp; on the second side with the sauce on top.  We ate this on brown cardboard because we forgot to bring plates, with one spoon because we forgot to bring forks. Just as we were finishing, comparing the color of the beautiful salmon to the clouds of the sunset, we got the first notice from the parks employees to clear out. Park closed, time to go home.  I really hope I deserve this, because I hope I am not the sort of person who would take out high-interest loans from the Karma Bank.

      I have already ranted a little bit about hoax emails of the hateful politically-motivated rightwing dittohead variety, but there is another kind that is more mysterious to me. &nbsp; We get these things from our mothers, sisters, and coworkers. Like any other hoax, there is a message at the bottom that says "email this to everyone you know." This variety is ones that warn you about a new crime tactic, and if memory serves me, almost all of them that I have gotten involve women in cars. Snopes is just full of these. Even when the crime tactic is plausible, the truth is that it just has not ever happened. Women are being constantly warned about crimes that just have not happened. &nbsp; Why doen't anybody ask, "What is the motivation behind these emails?" or "Who is responsible for generating them?" Our relatives just forward them, but somebody had to sit down and make this stuff up, and type it in, and set the hoax-virus into motion. Who? Why? Wouldn't that be a cool human-interest investigative journalism piece? Maybe those two journalistic genras don't overlap enough. &nbsp; If I were to guess, I would have to hypothesize that the intended effect is to keep women in a low-level state of fear all the time. To guess about the underlying motivation would be to get into paranoid theories about the patriarchy wanting us to be afraid to travel at will, and make those kinds of mistakes that you do when you are afraid. Maybe it is my own low level of free-floating fear that makes me imagine such an oppressor! &nbsp; Is it a lone gunman, i.e, some think-tank with funding and a directive to keep women in a state of minor hysteria, or is it a vast network of unrelated hoaxmakers who have all just happen to have hit upon the same successful M.O.? &nbsp; In any case, what I do is: search Snopes, find out that it is a hoax, copy the URL that debunks the hoax, go back to the email, hit "reply to all" and paste in the URL, with a request to send this back to whoever sent it to you. Be nice! people get embarrassed when they find out they have a dictionary that had the word "gullible" removed. We don't want to humiliate Mom, we just want to chase down those fear viruses and stomp them before they replicate again.

      I have to stand up for trial lawyers.  This has little to do with John Edwards. It has more to do with all this whining about "lawsuit abuse," and the agenda underlying it.  "Frivolous lawsuit" "litigious society" "sue-happy" and "lawsuit abuse," terms like this get repeated by the dittohead talk radio hosts, and sent around in the right-wing email circles where all they send each other is forwards near as I can tell, until after enough repetitions everyone accepts it as true, even if you personally do not know anyone who has gotten rich off a million-dollar lawsuit settlement. Even if you do know people who have gotten burned by landlords, police, insurance companies, unscrupulous ex-employers, etc., and had to turn to the courts to get their money or stuff back.  One of these forwarded emails from a conservative Gulf Coast relative was the "Sally Somethingorother" prizes for assinine lawsuit settlements, and each instance some numskull hurts him or herself with their own stupidity and then sues and comes out rich. The award was named for the lady who spilled hot coffee on herself and successfully sued McDonalds. But I wondered, how often does this really happen. And some of thes cases seemed so ridiculous....hmm, time to ask snopes. And as it turned out, none of these cases actually happened! 100% hoax! So I hit the "Reply to All" button and set the record straight with Cuz'n and everyone he sent the forward to. (Heh, heh, after I did this for a few of these rightwing rah-rah hoax emails, and the ones that just promote fear to women, he quit sending me that stuff. Hopefully, he got in the habit of checking snopes himself.)  Frivolous lawsuits do happen. But not nearly as much as the dittoheads would like you to think. Most of this stuff gets thown out of court because the judge can see the scam. What these right-wing think tanks are trying to do, and have been working on for nearly two decades, is to set our opinions against lawsuit abuse so that when they get their corporate puppet congressmen to pass anti-lawsuit legislation, or a Constitutional amendment even, we will not complain about the loss of our right to reddress grievances in the courts. That is what the agenda is: to make it impossible for ordinary people to sue corporations when they screw us over.  I'd rather protect that Constitudional right, and if it means throwing an unjust settlement or two to bottomfeeders, well, that is not too big a price to pay for it.

      One of the nonhuman residents in my body is a herpes virus. In the lip, thank goddess. He likes to come and hang out after I get sunburned, even just a little. Like I told you, the sun zaps my immune system. So when I went to the beach a week and a half ago, I was well aware that if my sunblock/shade combo was not 100%, I'd probably be getting a visit from Herpie.   By the time we were heading back, on Tues. the 29th, he was sending me emails. If I get my remedies on at that times, he might decide to go back and hide in my spine. By that evening I had some remedy on, and I thought he was just going to leave a note on the door, but by the next day there he was lounging on my lip. So no kissy-kissy for part 2 of vacation, the 4th of July weekend! Wah!  My consistent treatments since then lessened the average 3-4 week average visit of a herpes outbreak to a little over a week. There was no free beer in the fridge, so Herpie decided to go back to where he lives, which is between two vertebrae in my neck, next to my spine.  Ivieee's herpes simplex protocol: I wear dark lipstick if I am going to be in the sun. Sunblock lipbalms and such wear off and have an SPF nowhere close to my Manic Panic Purple Haze lipstick. (LM hates lipstick, so I didn't wear it at the beach this time! Is that love, or stupidity?) If your lips get sun exposure, or if you do whatever it is that triggers a sore, lick your lip and apply a dusting of Goldenseal powder right on the spot. (One single capsule is enough for a whole round of therapy, and for some reason the tincture of Goldenseal does not seem to help me.) When it wears off, do it again. That always does it for me, if I get it on by the "tingle" stage. I didn't get to it in time this time, so I kept applying the Goldenseal powder, and alternated it with some of my Natural Magic Healing oil, because it has a little real Lemon Balm (Melissa) essential oil in it. This stuff is fabulously expensive, and very effective against Herpie. Finally, I had just made a tincture of Prickly Ash, and because of its topical anaesthetic properties, I put that on straight. It sure did kill the pain, and I wonder if its antimicrobial properties are effective on viruses too? Anyway, I never did get a big sore, it didn't hurt much, and it is almost gone now, and I'm sure looking forward to some good kissin!

      Bet this sit has never happened to you!  Last summer, I started to notice that someone was trimming the trees and shrubs along the front of my property (well, the property I rent, anyway). Hmm, obviously, someone is making a comment on my pruning preferences. I would not even mention it except that dang, it has been raining a lot and when I got back from the beach thing had grown quite a bit but the PreDawn Whacker had struck again.   Last year even the neighborhood newsletter was talking about it (they mention the danger that vegetation poses to pedestrians and bicyclers, well that would be me, then, eh?) I called a neighborfriend who also keeps a wildish yard, and she said that her yard had been similarly attacked, and she thought, based on her reading of the neighborhood listserv postings, where it (whacking or not-whacking) was an issue of quite some controversy, she knew who it was: a former neighborhood association president in fact! A stuffy gentrifying do-gooder who wakes up to power-walk at 4am before light dawns, and takes it upon himself to trim vegetation that he feels is in violation of some unwritten neighborhood ordinance. You know, how could I complain if it was Johnson grass or some other non-native indicator species of abandon and neglect?? But we are talking about beautiful flowering trees and shrubs, known to attract birds and butterflies.  I never thought I would see the PreDawn Whacker, because there are about no occasions that I wake up that early. Much of my adult life has been arranged around not having to wake up early, it is just a disposition/genetic thing I guess. BUT recently, I was having a problem with Fear. Woke up after an unremembered dream and was afraid. Afraid of rapists and stalkers, afraid of Aliens coming to abduct me. Afraid of the Faeries. I should really write about Fear Itself one of these days but for now all you need to know is: When I have Fear that won't let me sleep, I find that it is completely alleved by going Outside. For me, dark is scary indoors but not outdoors.   So I throw down some mats and a sheet and try to sleep on the porch. Which -sigh- -yawn-  is about to be successful, when...  WHACK WHACK WHACK! What is that? I jump up off my pallet and there he is! The PreDawn Whacker! He and two female friends are power walking but they don't slow down for him. This is HIS cause, not theirs. As he whacks my Redbud tree, he is doing the jogging-in-place dance. Because, as you are trimming your neighbors trees without a contract, you wouldn't want to let your heartrate go down. I bet that when he first started, his heart rate would go up much faster than powerwalking could ever do! This is his "breaking the law" adrenaline high!! Enforcing the BushTrim initiative, heh heh!  Why did I not accost him? "Hey, what the HELL are you doing? That's my bush you're trimming, please use a 2 not a 1." Two big reasons: I was naked and I was sleepy. Maybe I was still even a little Afraid. And hell, my bushes grow pretty fast so let the little whacker have his way. It is kind of a chickenshit, cowardly approach. If he were a real neighbor, perhaps he would leave a note that said he just didn't like how my trees grow out to the street, and if I wanted, he would volunteer to keep my property trimmed. Maybe I'd take him up on it.

      This could go in the category of really unusual customer requests. They often start with "You may think this is a strange question..." but the really strange ones don't need to say this.  He was looking for a book about the meaning or vibrations of cemetary stones. "Hmmm," I said and pointed to books on spirit communication and the magical uses of stones. As I thought, none would be to the point of his quest.   As it turns out, the young man was in possession of a rock, part of an ancient burial cairn, from one of the most ancient cemeteries known, in the Sinai Penninsula between Egypt and Israel. He showed me said rock, and asked if I could tell the energies of objects. I declined to hold his stolen grave stone.  How to help. I suggested that the most proper thing to do would be to return it to the archaeological site he had visited those 10 years ago. He agreed, but maybe you can imagine, there is no mailing address and UPS has no idea. Then I put my brain on the front burner and in order, these are the things that steamed out: bury it at a Hebrew or Muslim cemetary here in TX (which we both decided was not the thing since the artifact predated both faiths), go to the Harry Ransom Center at UT and seek the advice of a curator, and then, duh, duh, D-OH!:  One of my good friends, ZZ, is the son of a woman who is a foremost archaeologists of the Mideast. In fact, when the Museum of Bagdad was looted at the beginning of the attack on Iraq, she was one of the world experts called in to assess the losses. ZZ told me, that before she went, she told him that she had wept for a week after hearing the news. That museum holds some of the most ancient keys to western civilization, some of which came from her digs, and most of those predate the big three warring religions. Something Skull and Bones would be interested in? But I digress.  The customer, P, will check with the Ransom Center. And I'll check out with someone of just one degree of separation as to how to get the stone home. Before he left I said I did want to hold it, after all. It did feel odd, old, but very energetic for something so old. I had never touched an ancient cemetary stone before, now I know how that feels. Unless it was HIS hooblajoobla that was on it, not the deads'.

      Yes in spite of the weather warnings, thunderstorms and floods, we went to the beach. It barely sprinkled on the way. Because of my first-class tent and LM's vehicle, there was no fear of rain, and I was actually delighted with the possibility that cloud cover would give me some freedom to play on the beach.  He goes over to windsurf at Bird Island, I prefer to stay on the Gulf side. So that means I have to erect a shade structure in order to survive. Most folks either throw up a prefab or strap a blue tarp across their car and call it done. Time to pop a beer. But since LM needs the car to get to where he's going to windsurf, I have to create a freestanding structure, which is one of the fun, engineering tarpsmanship challenges of the beach. That is, if you can do it before you fry!  A lot of people don't even bother with creating shade. Reddish-brown Gulf Coast citizens fish, drink beer and smoke cigarettes all day long for days at a time in the full sun as if they never heard the word melanoma. I just can't do it anymore, as an ex-Gulf Coast citizen. I fled the beach as soon as I found trees and shade. I've had one suspicious mole removed, but the main thing is that the sun zaps my immune system. I'll get a herpes fever blister for sure or a simmering respiratory infection. Too much sun and too much petroleum-based pollution when I was growing up, I guess. There are brown pelicans now on the beach, lots of them. There were none when I was growing up, frollicking in their habitat, because DDT had done them in. They didn't start coming back till I had left for Austin. I love the pelicans, welcome back, guys.  So that brings me to the point of this essay: non-pre-fab shade engineering!  Last time we went to the beach, two years ago now, I created my shade out of a big blue plastic tarp. I used 3 tent poles to make parallel arches, set them into 5-gallon buckets full of sand and water, and lashed the tarp to said structure with a very long length of telephone cord. Rebar to stake it down pup-tent style, at either end. These are all excellent raw materials to take to the beach, and the sand-and-bucket system to hold it down from the wind worked for a day, and the sunburn I got was incurred while I was setting it up, which took about an hour. By the time LM got back, I had a "kitchen" and "lounge" inside it, and my special Beach Bloody Mary for coctails. He was very impressed, maybe one of the reasons he decided I was a kinda girl he'd like to hang out with.  But the wind blew it all flat and flappy overnight, and next day I sheltered in the car, watching LM windsurf.  One of the other non-prefab shade structures we oggled that time looked like it had been retrofitted from an old parachute! Very post-apocalyptic looking, Road Warrior sheik, and it used the wind to help hold it up. My blue tarp cave technology just attempted to let wind go through, but when the wind changed directions, it got smashed.  This time I erected the blue tarp tube again, and the wind was kinder. But I felt trapped and caged in, and by the end of that first day it was obvious that I was getting sunburned even through the blue plastic. Well, gee, I never thought to ask what the SPF of a blue tarp is!!! My estimate: about 70. Better than sunscreen, but sure not 100%. Oh, yeah, sunblock lotions give me rashes and zits, and do nothing to save my immune system, even if it protects from sunburn.  Day 2 We tried something that would not be so claustrophobic. It was inspired by that parachute thing we'd seen before. I took a sheet, which happened to be blue and pink tie-died, good beach colors, and tied knots at each of the four corners, which allowed me to firmly tie a cord to each corner, and gave it a bit of a concave shape. After a few permutations, we had the lead edge (into the wind) tied/supported by two flexible white pvc poles which were slipped onto rebar stakes driven into the sand to hold them in place, and the rear end tied to two buckets of sand and water. It puffed up like a sail, like a kite!, and since the open end looked out to the beach, into the prevailing wind, we had a great view. (Of sea, sand, pelicans, and...convoys of drilling machines.) Later on we added a cord-and bucket attached to one of the front corners, which allowed us to yank it whichever direction, within about 30 degrees, the changing condition of the winds indicated. the back ends were 100% adjustable. You just hadd to move buckets and tie line to different lengths to get the best lift and shade coverage possible. Bet you'd like to see a picture, I'll see if I can figure out how to do that.  What's the SPF of a tie-dyed sheet?? I think about the same as a blue tarp. If I do this again, and I would go straight for the same technology, I'd use a dark-colored sheet to block more UVs. Unless I can find me a used parachute...

      Once upon a time, when I lived in a houseful of environmental activists, we soon noticed a pattern: that after a stint of organizing, some demonstration or newsletter production period or benefit, the house would be a shambles. Why was it that organizing was such a messy business? I forget, and none of us there at the time remember, who it was that pointed out that the Second Law of Thermodynamics dictates that the universe tends towards a disorganized state (entropy) and that in a closed system (as most of us believe the universe to be, or at least Texas) organization is only accomplished by creating disorder in another part of the closed system. From there on out, the house was called Entropy.  Some time thereafter we discovered that there was a more proper definition for the word "entropy" which we all understood to be the bachelor-quality mess the house and our personal lives represented. That more scientific definition was "the amount of energy present in a system that is unavailable for work." More than a few pitchers and bottles of tequila were toasted to  that !  Only because I was a fan of Ken Kesey's books did I later get into some of the less funny aspects of the 2nd Law. Having polished off  Sometimes a Great Notion  I careened straight into Demon Box. I won't even attempt to explain what a "demon box" is except that it is a perennial quixotic attempt to defeat Entropy and make possible the Perpetual Motion Machine. So often my introduction to reality comes through fiction that I will sometimes say things like "There is no such thing as fiction."  I had to check out a nonfiction treatment of the same concepts, and only now do I wonder if Ken Kesey had just finished reading  Entropy  by Paul Erlich before coming up with  Demon Box . Surely there were lots of physics professors who understood that stuff, but did Ken even take physics in college?   Entropy  is very frightening in a way that may have contributed to my retirement as an activist while at the same time making me believe more in the goals and motivations of the environmental and green left movements.   Entropy  argues that the process of evolution, and the evolution of human civilization not just follows the 2nd Law, but accelerates it. Each new advantage of evolution results in a creature more able to exploit natural resources and convert them into offspring and heat (aka entropy, the energy that has gone from a useful state to a dissipated one).  Next Erlich has us take a look at human culture in this context, because we humans  have  managed to evolve beyond the necessity of evolution. Now knowlege and technology have superceeded biological evolution as the means for our species to accelerate the exploitation of natural resources. And when we talk about acceleration, it is not a mere mathematical acceleration, it is exponential, reflecting the exponential growth of human population, which has a consequent result of producing a lot of unusable energy aka heat, that is, global warming. I don't even think that global warming was a concept at the time of writing of  Entropy .   Erlich mostly relates this process to the uncomfortable processes that humanity has gone through in the search for the next energy source. Our habit is to get into a new energy source and then accelerate its exploitation until it is all used up and then switch to the next most easily exploited source, which is not as efficient and therefore in the effort converts a higher percentage of usable energy to heat waste. There are charts and graphs, so watch out!  His suggestion? If we want to be a long-lived species on a resource-plentiful planet and let other species do their thing, too:  slow down. Slow down the conversion of natural resources into human beings, because as the most highly evolved beings on the planet using highly evolved energy intensive technology, we are very expensive on the planet and our organized state of living causes a concurrent increase of entropy in the system (our planet Earth). We experience this as global warming, hurricanes, and political instability, but it could just be called what it is: entropy.  So what is the bad news? It would be unlikely, anti-patternistic, and devolutionary to make any choices like this, because while we have used culture to accelerate the "goals" of evolution,  we have never used culture to limit those goals in the interest of a long-term purpose . Anyone who make choices like that, well there are names for them. "Conquered" "colonized" "loser" "whining liberal" if you get my drift. Unfortunately, asshole/conquistador/fratboy genes win out in the entropic game of evolution, producing more heirs and more heat.  Whatcha gonna do? I wonder what Charles Darwin would have thought.

      My thumb is better, but there is still something wrong in that joint.  Emo is recovering from his neutering op. Animal Trustees, which provides low cost spay/neuter and other services, rocks. And since Spooky, my 8 yr. old white cat was beating up on the new arrival, I looked up  urlLink info  on how to introduce a new animal into the household. I had figured that they just needed to have time and establish dominance, but this site recommends gradual introductions and not allowing aggressive behaviors, which can become patterns. Kind of like humans, I guess.  And I have been taking myself on a cautious tour through some scary landscapes: the rightwingers blog community. I am really quite frightened by what I see there. These people are only two links away from this blogger's Vine, but they might as well be on another planet as far as world view goes. That would be totally okay with me, but unfortunately those accumulated worldviews add up to war, untempered nationalism, and a very meanspirited intolerance of anything left of Rush Limbaugh. This polarization is very dangerous, I think. We are becoming a divided nation, and the dominant class is getting more and more aggressive towards the submissive counterculture. Every time the left scores (Farenheit 911, nearly busting Bush for treason re: the Valerie Plame outing, etc) the rightwing response gets meaner, ruder, and more intimidating. Are we supposed to puff ourselves up in response? Hiss and spit? Wouldn't that further the divide, which if allowed to continue, could result in us evolving into separate species, or a pogrom or forced death march????  Reading about things like Protest Warriors, which do things like harass CodePINK (positively the creampuffiest side of the left, and proud of it) as they are leafletting could develop into patternistic aggressive behavior just like my cats, I am aftaid.  Of course I am very sensitive about aggressive nationalism after reading  Night  by Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, an autobiographical account of his boyhood experiences in Aushwitz and beyond, a struggle to survive and make sense of the inhuman cruelty of the Holocaust.  When my own family members talk about forced deportation of people like me and my friends who criticize Bush or neocon nationalism, I wonder how far away we are from reliving one of the worst nightmares humanity has ever created.

      Finally! I finished  Triumph of the Moon ! I have been working on this book for 4 months. Between the microscopic typeface, and the fact that I only read at bedtime and usually with only xmas tree lights so as not to wake LM, and because I was taking time to chew, I let this one take its time.   Triumph of the Moon  examines the history of the genesis of modern pagan witchcraft. It is written by a real historian academic scholar, Ron Hutton, and he spends most of the book debunking popular pagan stories of our own genesis, like where Gerald Gardner got his material, no, there was no pervasive goddess religion that covered all of Europe, and no, the people killed during the Witch Burning time were not practitioners of witchcraft or an underground pagan religion.  My only criticism of the book is that once he smashes a myth, he rarely bothers to suggest an actual reality as opposed to the delusion. So I feel like I have woken up from a dream, but I can't find my glasses and I don't remember how I got here. Some kind of reconstruction is in order here.  I wonder what some of the living authors who purposefully or ignorantly passed on bad information will do to recant or do a new foundation job where the shims got taken out. Starhawk in particular takes some direct hits. The bookwriting and reading pagan clergy need to pay attention to this sort of thing.  It strikes me how easily language and human willingness to be deluded allow falsehood and misinformation to be passed around. Again I wonder how much else of the world we are taking for truth, just because it is part of the fabric of pop culture/the dominant paradigm (or the submissive counterculture's reaction to it). In many ways, myths and lies are easier to perpetuate. They are catchy, like advertising jingles. We want to believe. Truth is much more complicated, it takes time and work to do it justice, and most people just do not have the time or intellectual curiosity. Reminds me of the "Honesty" card in Brian Froud's Faeries Oracle deck.  I toast people like Ron Hutton who are brave enough to confront willing self delusion. "Here, I found your glasses. They were covered with crud, so I cleaned them for you." "Oh, thanks, Ron, but I sure hope you made coffee too, 'cause I have a mean hangover. And you're not nearly as cute as when I took you to bed!"

      I might have to go to the emergency room tomorrow! Shit! Thursday night, my left thumb started to hurt, and it got stiff and crunchy at the last joint. Then when I woke up Friday it was frozen stiff and sore and swollen. I took the day off to self-medicate, but here it is Saturday night, and it is still big and painful and now it has some fever.  Either: the sprain I got breakdancing over a year ago actually chipped the bone and I have a bone spur, or, the cactus/mesquite spine I took to that knuckle over 5 years ago finally decided to get infected and/or come out, or the little knife wound I got cooking two weeks which seemed to heal just fine actually didn't, or, when I was under the house earlier this week or in bed a spider bit me on the thumb.  Too many variables! Ice, painkillers, aspirin, echinacea, reiki, and ichthammol and it is still screamming with pain!  I have been to the emergency room on my own behalf only once, but I left before I got treatment so I didn't get a big bill. I'm kind of scared that an emergency room doctor will be as clueless as me, and will give me antibiotics which won't work. I CAN'T take antibiotics anymore unless it's life-threatening, my immune system is all crapped out by antibiotic abuse in my youth.  So now I go to bed with the ichthammol on, hoping it will draw out the poison/infection/foreign matter like it has done for me so well in the past.

      I got a new kitty, a rescued/abandoned 9 month old. He is shiny black, with a star on his throat and a crescent moon on his belly. I named him Emo.  I called Animal Trustees of Austin to get an appointment to get him neutered. Don't get me started about people who refuse to spay or neuter their pets. When they are in Hell hanging by the nuts from the intestines of all the abandoned kittens and puppies they are responsible for, they won't think   I   was harsh.  As Luck would have it, the first possible date for me to get my kitty fixed is this coming Friday the 13th! The lady setting the date chuckled about that. Here is what LM (LoverMan) said: "Castrating a black cat on Friday the 13th? ARE YOU MAD!??" All tongue-in-cheek, of course. LM is possibly the least superstitious person I know.  But am I poking a finger in the eye of Fate here? As a witch, I love superstitions, but I don't usually take them in the same way that the general public does.  The last time I encountered a black cat superstition was in fact on me and LM's first real date. He was giving me a ride back home from a show and a party, and it was very obvious that we liked each other very much. At a major Crossroads, a black cat ran across the streets in front of us! I think he asked me what that meant to me, and it just popped out of my mouth: "A black cat crosses your path, you make an important decision real fast. Like right now I am deciding whether or not to invite you in when we get to my house. Okay, I decided."  And it was one of the luckiest decisions I've ever made!

      After a very long grace period, it finally feels like summer in Austin. Nobody, with the possible exception of  urlLink Trailer Park Girl  seems to notice or comment that we have had a blessedly cool summer so far, and it will be cooler within less than two months, which is a very short summer in Texas indeed!  I am one of the few people here who lives without air conditioning. I ride my bike to (minimally air conditioned) work just before noon, and I have to be cheerful to people upon opening the shop. So it can be done, adapting to the heat.  My theory is this: your body's metabolic processes are all done by enzymes, large proteins that break up food molecules, reassemble them, and do just about every biochemical conversion that takes place in a living being. But they are very sensitive to temperature changes, and most operate witin a two to four degree celcius range, some even less. This is the "reason" that some animals (birds and mammals) "decided" to be homeothermic (warm-blooded) which means that we will burn calories to make our bodies cooler or warmer in order to maximize enzyme function. So when it gets too hot or cold, we are potentially burning as many or more calories than we are gaining from enzymatic metabolic processes. Okay, all the previous was textbook, now here is my theory: At that point, your body is faced with the choice of shutting down, just sitting there and doing nothing because it is too hot, or doing a bit of biochemical dirtywork and switching enzymes for ones that work better in a few degrees hotter or cooler body core temperatures. That is the place in adapting to temperature change where we feel uncomfortable and complain a lot about the heat or cold.  The only thing to do is just go right into it and adapt and change enzymes. Be hot for awhile, exercise, don't retreat into air conditioning because that will just fool your body into thinking that it can put off that enzyme job for another few days or weeks even.

      Since I began eating fish and seafood again, I decided to research to research the health and environmental implications of that dietary choice. Most of us know that the oceans are not as invulnerable as we thought back in the 60’s, and that overfishing has dramatically impacted the size and number of many fishes, and that pollution has made many unfit for human consumption.  Another question for me is probably not of interest to you consumers of animal flesh, and that is whether the fish in question is intelligent, has feelings, nurtures it’s young. “Intelligent fish?” you sneer? Hold on a minute, though. Some marine fish become sexually mature late in life, have a short breeding phase, and then go on to live a hundred or hundreds of years. What is going on there? I wanted to screen these fish for potential consciousness, especially after a saleslady friend of mine told me that although she ate seafood, she wouldn’t eat groupers because they were intelligent and nurtured their young.  I haven’t been able confirm her claim, but it is immediately apparent that nobody should be eating grouper at this point. Here are some of the resources I found, which makes it lots easier for me to eat seafood responsibly:  For example,  urlLink Monterrey Bay Aquarium  says ‘Orange roughy live longer than 100 years—the fillet in your freezer might be from a fish older than your grandmother! This deep-living fish, once known as the “slimehead,” grows very slowly and doesn’t spawn until age 20. Fishermen find them as they gather to spawn. At first, bonanza catches could be taken. But years of heavy harvest on the spawning grounds have decimated populations. Management is now in place, but it will take decades for this slow-growing fish to recover. Orange roughy are caught by bottom trawling, a method which can damage the seafloor, with unknown impacts on the fragile deep-sea ecosystem.’   urlLink Seafood Choices Alliance  warns: ‘All commercially fished flounder in the Atlantic (summer, windowpane, winter, witch and yellowtail) are depleted and overfished. Landings have fallen by approximately 70% for summer flounder and 65% for winter flounder within the past 20 years, and by some 60% and 95% respectively for witch and windowpane flounder within the past 15 years. Landings of yellowtail flounder dropped approximately 90% between 1983 and 1995, and have since only partially rebounded.’  But, according to  urlLink Environmental Defense  ‘Channel catfish are the most commonly farmed fish in the United States. These omnivorous fish are raised in ponds in the Southeast, and are fed mostly vegetable-based diets. Channel catfish are a native species, and escaped farmed catfish do not appear to cause ecological harm.'  Much less is available about intelligence and emotional capacity of sea animals, with the exception of whales and dolphins, which of course should not be on the menu for many reasons other that it is the next most deplorable thing to cannibalism. The most that I have encountered about non-cetacean intelligence in the sea is about octopi and related cephalopods like squids and cuttlefish. These mollusks, relatives of brainless clams and oysters, have large brains, extensive sensory nervous system processing ability, learning capacity, and maybe even language and emotions. I have seen mind-blowing video of cuttlefish flashing color-changing patterns of rapid-fire diversity. Why? Especially when it seems to have nothing to do with simple camouflage, mating or hunting? I give these animals the benefit of the doubt for intelligence and don’t eat them.  Here is a really balanced  urlLink look  at cephalopod intelligence. ‘...the 1992 "look-and-learn" study, by neuroscientists Graziano Fiorito and Pietro Scotto at Naples, is the most controversial of all the attempts to understand learning in cephalopods. To test if O. vulgaris could learn a skill by observing the activities of other octopuses, the researchers trained one group to choose a red ball or a white one. When the trained animals reliably approached one or the other ball, untrained octopuses were allowed to watch. When later presented with a choice of their own, these animals not only selected the same ball more often throughout the five days of the trial, but also learnt more quickly through observing than the original subjects had under classical Pavlovian conditioning.  "The rapid acquisition and the stability indicate that observational learning in Octopus vulgaris is a powerful mechanism of learning," the researchers concluded (Science vol. 256, p 545). The finding was astounding not least because observational learning is considered by some to be a preliminary step to conceptual thought.’  This experiment has not been replicated in peer experiments (non-reproducible results) and how intelligent calamari are remains debatable. Of course one of the main problems is not how intelligent, but how differently intelligent they are, and we are still in the process of discovering how to ask and test this question. In other words, we humans are not yet clever enough to figure out how smart an octopus is. ‘Nuff said!
