      when i woke up, i felt like ass. i feel drained and sick and sleep deprived. i couldn't even move my neck. i still can't.

i had eggs for breakfast but have yet to have the time to read the south beach book. i got home from work after 1 a.m. and woke up early to write articles. i'll probably be at work even later tonight too.

i think i may pause this diet for the weekend. carrie is going away and i have no plans. so, that buys me the time to read the book. i'll figure out the right things to eat and come back renewed on monday.

as the weekend progresses, i'll write about what i find in the book. since i have a hard time figuring this stuff out, maybe people can help me along the way.

      for dinner i ended up having a bbq chicken breast and parmiggiano reggiano from wholefoods. that place is so damned expensive. i spent $16 on dinner and i didn't even get french fries. sheesh.

i'll work on reading the south beach book tonight since carrie is annoyed at me now that i'm relying on her for information.

      i've decicded to try the south beach diet and blog about both my humiliating experiences and my horrible failures.
 
today is my first day on the diet. it's 3:00 and i already am not too much of a fan. on the other hand, since i don't eat any meats beside chicken and turkey, it won't be too much of a setback.
 
being italian, though, i eat everything with bread. being from philly, i have french fries and ketchup with every meal that isn't pasta. but, sometimes, i'll eat fries with pasta too.
 
yesterday, i decided that today would be my first day on the diet. so, carrie and i went out to dinner and i had my favorite huge meal: a double turkey burger and fries from the city grille.
 
this morning, i woke up and realized that i have little-to-no idea about how to actually be on this diet. carrie was filling me in on the blanks since she did it and lost weight on it. i remembered three things: 1. no carbs. 2. lots of chicken. 3. lots of peanuts.
 
for breakfast, i had 2 heaping handfuls of cashews. they were laura's cashews. so, i should probably buy some to replace the ones i ate.
 
for lunch, i had half of a chicken breast, cooked in balsamic vinegar and served over a bowl of lettuce with, guess what, balsamic vinegar.
 
i'm drinking lots of water because the vinegar has made me feel lightheaded.
 
for dinner, i'll probably have scrambled eggs. i like doing things backwards.
 
the only thing is, i don't know how to figure out if i've lost weight or not. our scale sucks. on any given day, it'll tell me i'm anywhere between 150 and 260 lbs. my weight fluctuates quickly but not that quickly.
