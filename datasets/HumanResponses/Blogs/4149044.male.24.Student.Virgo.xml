       My dad's in town this weekend so I spent the morning and early afternoon with him, eating chinese buffet (of course) followed by some furniture shopping for the new townhouse. We started out looking for barstools at a skandinavian store and ended up wanting to buy everything else. I don't like a lot of the stuff we currently have but it's not like we can just throw it all away. So I'm not sure what we're going to do, though I already suggested we dump off some of the furniture at our house in Hugo. Since my dad is giving the place to me I really don't want it to look tacky or mismatched. Why spend a half mil on just a townhouse (half the price of our current house but  infinitely  smaller) only to furnish it with stuff that looks either out of place or just plain ugly. Don't get me wrong..we have a lot of nice shit right now, but I don't think some of it will look as good in such a small space. I'm already afraid the place will look like a freaking chinese antique shop.   Next week we're going to look at some plasmas for the living room. Our ancient 35" weighs 85,492lbs and takes up approximately one acre of space. We'll probably get rid of the oldass 35" and 30" Toshibas for those reasons alone..anyone need a tv?      I still feel so fucking stuffed from lunch. I was good on my diet for uhm  two  whole days. Damn I really need to workout.

       The last month has definitely been an experience, one in which I just don't see myself ever fully recovering from. The paramedics knocking on my door at 3am..the ride to and subsequent three hour stay in the ER..the 30 hour stay at Green Oaks..my first visit with the doc..the heart palpitations..the sleepless nights..my best friend deciding she wanted nothing further to do with me, without the slightest attempt at an explanation..that incredible weekend in Vegas..the start of the fall semester. It's been a crazy ride with few ups but plenty of downs.       In just this past month alone I experienced both the highest of highs and the lowest of lows..though of course the lows generally predominated. Aside from the time spent with Grace and that incredible weekend getaway, things have just been downright shitty. No I take that back. Shitty doesn't even begin to describe how fucked up, depressed, and miserable I've been feeling. All in all, t  his experience has  not  made me stronger and it has  not  made me more appreciative of life in general. Do I still want to kill myself? Honestly, yes. Am I going to? I don't know. I feel as if I owe it to Grace to at least try..try to think about our future together and the supposedly better life that awaits.     I truly believe that everything happens for a reason. I just don't know what it is I'm supposed to take from all this. Life's just taken this great big shit on me. What the fuck am I supposed to do now? I can't go on acting as if everything's ok and back to normal because it's not. And I doubt it will be for quite some time. So that's where I'm at right now. I have no fucking clue.

       Nothing but fucking children in my morning history class. There were these two irritating girls sitting behind me who wouldn't shut the hell up.    annoying bitch #1: The people at this school either look really, really old or really, really young..that's like sooooo weird!          annoying bitch #2: Yea like oh my god right?!          annoying bitch #1: Yea like I mean I had a class this morning and I walked in and like everyone like looked like fourteen ya know? Everyone at my highschool looked sooooo much older. Like totally!          annoying bitch #2: Like oh my god!    This is how their entire fucking conversation went. Even when the prof started talking they wouldn't shut the hell up. I finally got a look at them as I was walking out..and they BOTH looked like a couple of fucking kiddies. Fugly too.

       The first day of school is officially over. Thank god. I had government 1 at 12:30, and that class was just completely filled with irritating  "look at me! I'm so cool because I'm in college!"  freshmen .  Fucking children. I'm going to be 25 in a few weeks. That means these kids were 11 when I was a freshman in college. I feel so fucking old. The professor seemed nice enough, but did he really have to lecture the entire hour and a half on the first day of class?..with the fucking a/c turned OFF during the first 15 minutes? I was sweating like a fat bitch in there. Grace didn't have class at that time (her physics class at Richland doesn't start until next week) so she sat through it all with me. She really is the bestest.      I finally made it to the gym after class. The Vegas trip really threw me off schedule so I spent a good chunk of the morning thinking how I should revamp my training split. After much deliberation, I decided I'm just too fucking anal to start a new routine. So instead, I'm just going to restart the cycle with chest/shoulders today, skip back/traps this week since I already worked them, hit arms on Saturday, and finally legs on Monday. I actually had to think long and hard before making this decision. I'm such a dork. Oh but I did manage to set a new pr today on the incline. Ima be a big boy.      My 5:30 government 2 class was also rather boring. Thankfully the class size was much smaller. Unfortunately all the girls in there were fugly as hell so there was nothing to keep me awake. Only kidding of course..I never look at other girls right honey? We bought our books afterwards at Off Campus and then came home for dinner and abc's Extreme Makeover. And also some sweet, sweet lovin'. heehee I'm such a kidder.

       Ok so I popped another ambien around 4am and ended up sleeping through my alarm. Got out of bed around 9:15 and got my ass on the road to the gym a few minutes later. I couldn't remember if the gym was closed on mon/wed or tue/thur for some retarded weightlifting class. Anyway, it's raining like a crazy bitch and since it's the first day of class, there was no parking. Wonderful. I ended up parking waaaay the fuck out there, hiked my ass through the pouring rain to the gym..only to discover the class was on tue/thur (that be today) at 9:30. Fuck fuck fuck. I've done this like a half dozen times the past couple years. What the fuck's wrong with me? Geezus. Yea so I had to run back to my car, drive back, and blog this bitch.       Oh and funny thing, as I was pulling out of my neighborhood, who do I see driving behind me like an old granny? My good ol' buddy Stewart. I haven't talked to him in a longass time..think he's still pissed about me not wanting to drive his ass across town like a fucking chauffeur? Yea me too.  Oh well.

       Popped two ambiens but still found myself waking up a couple hours later. Oh well. Guess I'll have to just make do with eating ice cream sandwiches and watching episodes of Recess until morning comes.

       I'm finishing up all but one of my pharm school pre-reqs this semester in taking both governments, a history class, and something on the biological basis of diseases. Also have to study my ass off for the two finals I missed this past summer. I'm just glad I don't have any labs this year..that shi  t's such a fucking waste of time.       Early pharm application deadlines are coming up in a few months. Last year I applied to the #2 ranked school in the country and ended up on the waitlist. I'm happy I at least made it to the final cut, but it still pisses me off I have to spend another year in Dallas..another year stuck in limbo. I figure I'll apply to all schools in Texas and Oklahoma, and a few in California like #1 ranked UCSF. It would be cool to hang out with vpatel out in cali so we'll see. Not sure what other schools and states to look at..will have to check PharmCAS later. All I know is I'm not fucking around this time. No more "top 5 school or nothing" mentality. A PharmD's a PharmD right? As long as the school isn't some ghetto-ass dump in the boonies, I honestly could care less.       Damn I can't believe school's already starting up. The new townhouse is complete so it's also time to start hauling all my crap over there. The excitement never ends.

       Ok this is seriously messed up. I picked up Bitsy from the vet earlier today and holy crap she's freaking FAT now! What the hell were they feeding her there? She's practically doubled in weight..no joke. Oy vey.

       Just worked out and showered. Finally hit back/traps today but was feeling pretty winded early on..only got up to 455lbs on rack deads. BLAH. Now I have to go pick up Bitsy from the vet. The total bill ended up being $132 for the four days of boarding and her final round of kitten shots. Damn. Babies are so fucking expensive. All I gotta say is they better not have touched her hillbilly bandana.

       Got back from Vegas a few hours ago and damn it sucks to be home again. The trip was just  UNBELIEVABLE . We both had such an awesome time, savoring every second we got to spend together. I know I've said this a million times before but damn I love that girl. We've been together almost two years now and yet we still can't get enough of each other. How fucked up is that? I've never felt this way about anyone before in my life. She's just so incredibly perfect in every way. Now if I could just save up that $20k for the ring I want to get her.. I bitched all weekend about how I wanted to get married there. Only kidding of course. Ok no I wasn't. Oh and get this, we ended up  blowing around ** $800 ** on eating out alone..in just three days.  Eating was just so much fucking fun. Anyway, on with the recap.        I look retarded. Grace looks cute. Fuck off.     Friday: Day 1    Got up early Friday morning to squeeze in one last workout but soon realized there just wasn't enough time. We never found anyone to look after Bitsy so we had to leave early and drop her off at a pet hotel before heading to the airport. Fifteen freaking bucks a day. Fuck. Finding a place to park at DFW also sucked ass. All the far lots were full so after a half-hour of driving cluelessly around we ended up parking in the $10/day express lot. Double fuck. Our flight was rather uneventful, aside from the fat korean guy sitting next to us watching some asian softcore porno flick on his laptop.       But everything changed once we got to Vegas. Holy shit that town's changed since I last visited. Grace had never been before so that made things even more exciting for the both of us. I just couldn't wait to experience Vegas with her. After checking in at the MGM, we had a late lunch at  Wolfgang Puck's Bar &amp; Grill . I knew Wolfgang Puck had five restaurants in Vegas and I really wanted to try two or three of them..yea I'm a fucking pig. The braised lamb was definitely the shit. After lunch we did some gambling and some more exploring around the hotel.  Video poker and blackjack  are so fucking addicting. Later we got all prettied up and had dinner at  Shibuya  before taking the monorail down the strip. We had gotten tickets for the 10:30 showing of  Mystere  at Treasure Island. Grace had never seen a Cirque Du Soleil production so all throughout the show I kept hearing  "wow!"  and  "oh my god did you see that?"  coming from her direction. She's so fucking cute. My feet were killing me (fucking shoes hurt like hell) so we went back to the hotel afterwards and gambled a few hours before having a late-night dinner at  Studio Cafe .       Saturday: Day 2    We pretty much just explored the strip all day long, checking out some of the newer hotels like the Monte Carlo, Paris, Venetian, and New York-New York. We also had a late morning champagne brunch at the  Aladdin's Spice Market Buffet , which was rated #1 in Vegas. I could definitely see why..damn we stuffed ourselves silly. After more exploring and more gambling at various casinos, we got our scruffy asses cleaned up once again and had dinner at  Postrio . I was kind of pissed we had to wait a while for a table since we had made reservations in advance. Oh well what can you do right? The filet mignon and triple chocolate dessert definitely made up for the wait. The bill was a  paltry $170  so I let Grace take care of that one heheh. Actually, it was my  early birthday dinner  so that's why she paid. After dinner we walked the strip, got me a comfortable  new pair of shoes  at Rockport (I was tired of hobbling around like a fucking cripple), heard a hotel employee yell out " you pick it up, you funny looking fat girl"  to some ghetto-looking black woman walking by, and then caught the 10:30 showing of  La Femme  at the MGM. The show was pretty cool..naked chicks and crazy lighting effects. There was also this incredibly random Michael Jackson skit thrown in towards the end that was just fucking hilarious. Later that night,  Grace won $631  playing the quarter slots..after spending a whopping one quarter. Holy shit that was so fucking cool, especially considering the fact that I kept getting impatient and losing all my money doing   max bets   on the video blackjack machines. After having a late-night dinner at  The Grand Wok  and some more gambling, we headed up to our room and rented  Kill Bill Vol. 2  and some crappy porno. I think we ended up going to bed around 6am. Good times.       Sunday: Day 3    Sunday was just a day of gluttony. After having the champagne brunch at  MGM's Grand Buffet  (the Aladdin buffet was waaaaay better), I felt like a big fucking fatass and decided to pay the jacked-up fee to workout at the  MGM Grand Spa  while Grace got a manicure. The gym was a lot smaller than I expected but it at least had a decent set of weights to work with. After spending a few hours at the spa, we got dressed up and headed over to the  Eiffel Tower Restaurant  to make our dinner reservations. We had an incredible view of  The Fountains of Bellagio , and ended up  blowing $200 on dinner . It's a damn good thing Grace won that money huh? I think that was my first souffle experience ever..ooh la la. Unfortunately, my baby was feeling a little sick afterwards so we decided not to do the  Eiffel Tower Experience . Instead, we checked out all the  fancy-schmancy shops  at the Bellagio and Caesar's Palace before taking a cab over to the  Crazy Horse Too  strip club. That's right, I took Grace to her very first titty bar muahaha. We wanted to go to a "nice" strip club but couldn't remember the names of any of the ones we had seen ads for. I'm a pussy so Grace asked the driver to take us to one of the nicer clubs. The place he dropped us off at wasn't too bad I guess. The $40 cover and $18 drinks (a bud light and a pina colada..geezus) was pretty fucked up, but I guess the girls were decent enough. Some were rather fugly and had either too much or too little ass..but there were definitely some hotties there as well. We had fun  laughing at the horny old fobs  emptying out their wallets for an endless number of lapdances. Oh and the old fat guy bopping around with glowstick in hand was fucking priceless. I wanted to  buy her a lapdance , but after seeing the dancers rub their tits all over the guys' faces and dryhump the hell out of them, she really didn't want one. Silly girl. After getting back to our room, we rented some more porn and picked up some late-night  Mickie D's . I hadn't eaten that shit in years. I felt so fucking gross afterwards.     Monday: Day 4    Monday was rather uneventful. We woke up early, packed up our shit, had breakfast at Studio Cafe, and headed over to the airport to make our 11:50am flight. Neither of us wanted to go home. It had been a dream weekend and we really didn't want it to end. But all good things must come to an end right? Dallas sucks.

       Just had one of the most brutal chest workouts ever..seriously. Surprised the hell out of me considering a) I was tired as hell, and b) the gym had no power whatsoever (no lights, no a/c, nothing). I was sweating like a bitch and dragging my feet to and from the water fountain every few minutes, but holy shit I pushed those 100lb dumbbells on incline as if they were nothing at all. I wish the gym had heavier weights. Also blasted delts and calves..good times. Tomorrow I plan on working back and traps before my 12pm flight. Gotta burn as many cals as possible before my three-day bingefest ya know?      Still haven't packed and still haven't gone to Target. Still don't know what to do with Bitsy either. Grace should be here in a bit. I think we're going to head over to Stonebriar for some last-minute shopping, and then finally stop at Super Target on the way back. Damn I'm hungry. Tried to go to Buca yesterday but soon realized it wasn't open for lunch on weekdays. Dammit. Maybe we'll go there tonight. I'm seriously craving their margarita pizza and jumbo meatballs. Ok time to shower.

       Popped another pill shortly after my last post and ended up sleeping off and on until 7. After watching some boring-ass cartoons I got tired again and slept 'til noon. Works for me. I'm flying out tomorrow so I've got a ton of shit to do. Will head out to Super Target in a bit, then finally get my ass to the gym to abuse my chest and shoulders. Decided against working legs this week because I really don't want to walk around Vegas like an old cripple with a stick up his ass. Also need to decide what to do with Bitsy while we're away. Will probably end up leaving her at some pet hotel or whatever. Mo money, mo money, mo money..damn. Oh well, must not think about it. I'm determined to have a kickass time this weekend while NOT thinking about how much debt I'll be racking up. It's only money right?

       Saw the doc this morning and really didn't like what he had to say. Will see him again in three weeks. After my appointment Grace and I had lunch at Blue Mesa (holy shit they have a buffet now), then walked around West Village for a while. Also finally got my hair cut. Oh and we tried to get tickets for "O" but apparently it's not showing until the 18th, so we just went ahead and got tickets for Mystere. I've seen it before but think Grace would really like it. Being broke really sucks.

       Dropped Bitsy off at the vet this morning to get her whiny butt washed and groomed. She really needs it. I still haven't slept and am really fucking tired. Thinking about dragging my ass to the gym though.      Grace and I have been planning our trip next weekend (still waiting on that damn confirmation), and holy shit it's looking pretty expensive so far. Spago's or Nobu. Studio 54 or Rain. Voodoo Lounge or Ghost Bar. No matter what we choose or where we go, everything is going to be so fucking expensive. What happened to the days of the $5 all-you-can-eat steak dinners my dad keeps talking about? Fuckin' A. Not sure I want to spend $200 to see Lance Burton make shit disappear, or pay $25 to ride a two-minute roller coaster at New York, New York. I definitely want to see Zumanity though, and I guess I can deal with just going to either Rain or Studio 54. We'll probably end up spending a lot of time just walking around, checking out all the new hotels and shops. The rest of the time we'll be eating. There are so many nice-ass restaurants in Vegas there's just no way I'm going to settle for generic shit. I would much rather blow $80 at a nice restaraunt - like one of Wolfgang Puck's or one of Emeril's - than spend it at some magic show. I'm all about eating. So far I think we've decided on Spago's, Postrio, and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. And of course a champagne brunch at the Bellagio or MGM. That's probably around $300 right there, but at least we'll have a ton of fun getting our money's worth heheh. Crap I just found out the Aladdin is completely booked for this weekend. Damn. Time to call up the Monte Carlo or MGM or whatever else is available.

       Despite taking two ambiens, woke up at 3am and have been eating sausage and cheese kolaches while watching reruns of Full House on Nick at Nite. See, insomnia does have its perks.      Damn heart rate's back to being super-hyper again. What the hell?

       So the day started out innocent enough..had a banana for some pre-workout carbs, went to the gym, blasted my arms, then treated myself to a Smoothie Factory protein mrp/smoothie combo. But things pretty much went downhill from there as I stuffed my face with 11 kfc chicken strips, had dinner at Genroku a few hours later, then pushed my gut to the limit with a half dozen fruit kolaches..on the way home from the restaurant. Needless to say, the abs are currently in hiding. And I don't think they'll be coming back out anytime soon.      Jon's so fucking cool. After we had dinner, he ran to his car to get something out of the trunk. As he walked back towards us, I saw those two wonderful, loveable Czech characters and almost shrieked like a fat hungry chick at the jumbo super buffet. Jon had gone to Czech Stop. And he had brought back kolaches. Fruit AND sausage. Jon's my hero.      I'm so fucking full.

       Got back from the gym an hour ago and I gotta say I'm feeling somewhat better. My heart rate seems to have stabilized since skipping my morning wellbutrin. I have my follow-up on Wednesday so hopefully the doc will have a better combo for me to try..two weeks on this shit and I'm still feeling pretty lousy. Only thing I've experienced so far has been a shitload of sides. This blows.      On the bright side, my workout was pretty good. Worked arms today and was able to push a decent amount of weight. My back still hurts for some reason but hopefully I'll be able to hit legs tomorrow. Last week I damn near puked while doing squats and deads..real cool huh?

       Well it's 6:30 and I'm still up..another hour and the gym should be opening up.  Heart rate's still pretty high but not as bad I don't think.  Hope I don't get a fucking heart attack working out.

       Rolled out of bed at 3am but this time I didn't mind so much, having just booked a 4 day/3 night trip to Vegas next weekend. Well I'm still waiting on the hotel confirmation. Decided to go with Aladdin after reading the reviews and asking around, but may end up settling for the Monte Carlo if it comes up unavailable. Now I just have to figure out all the shit I want to do. Gambling..well duh. Also plan on trying out some of the nicer restaurants like Nobu, Spago, and Postrio. Not sure what shows are out but I do plan on catching Cirque du Soleil and maybe some Penn &amp; Teller. Or maybe something with more tits..hehe just kidding of course. Oh and I definitely want to go up the Eiffel Tower and maybe try out an escort or two. Damn this shit's sounding real expensive, real fast. Oh well, this is my bday present right? I'm worth it. muahahaha      Oh and no I'm not serious about the escort thing. Well..maybe if Grace is up for it.

       I know I've said this a million times already but damn that was some shitty sleep. Took two ambiens again, and ended up waking up at 5 this time. I guess that's an improvement. I don't know how much more of this I can take. I feel completely worn out, yet my heart is constantly beating like crazy. My dad said it's because of the wellbutrin. He doesn't want me taking this shit because his co-worker's boyfriend died of a heartattack while on it. All I gotta say is that it sucks. My heart is racing 24/7, and it's beating so damn hard that it actually prevents me from falling asleep. I'm guessing this extreme fatigue is also due to the meds..my body's feeling so completely worn out that it's actually a bitch to just walk down the stairs. This isn't cool. Maybe if I drag my ass to the gym later I can get hyped up enough to actually workout. I swear the second I walk into that place I always get completely amped and energized, no matter how shitty or tired I was feeling before. We'll see. If I can just make it down the fucking stairs..      I ended up staying in last night because I was just too damn tired to go out by the time I got ahold of Eva. Sorry Eva..oh and I still think you're full of shit. Ok so she  claims  she was born and partially raised in the same Chicago suburb as me. No one I've talked to has ever heard of Glendale Heights, yet she expects me to believe we were both living in the same city at the same time? Yeaaaa ok. I think someone needs to put the pipe down and step away from the bong. heheh      What the fuck am I doing today? Oh yea..Jon's coming back today so I think we're all having dinner later. Maybe watch a movie or something afterwards. Jon's a real cool guy, cheek-pinching fetish and all. I wonder what bitsy's up to..I swear she better not have shat on the carpet again. Bad kitty. She's so fucking spoiled it's no wonder she's constantly whining whenever she doesn't get all the attention. Seriously she won't shut up once she starts whining and meowing. I wish she had an on/off switch. That would be fucking badass.      Oh yea, I had a dream that this guy I went to highschool with accused me of having a mullet. What a prick.

       Ok so I just had lunch at Clay Pit..nothing like good ol' injun food to cheer me up right? Wrong. I feel like complete shit. Not only am I feeling like shit mentally, but now I have this damn heartburn to deal with. Rosh asked if I wanted to go with her to Edgefest today. Too bad I didn't go cuz you just  know  I'd be the life of the party right?   Grace should be back in a couple of hours and Eva wants to catch a movie later tonight. What the hell is out right now? Oh well, who cares..as long as I have my box of Sour Patch Kids I'm good to go.       I still can't believe how indifferent and uncaring some people can be. I've been thinking about this all morning. I mean, am I the only one who feels this way?..that friendships are sacred and should be treated as such? Love is another thing I don't fuck around with. I guess my problem is that I tend to open my heart up too damn much while expecting others to do the same. Yea I'm kooky like that.      Oh and get this, the bill for my ambulance ride to the ER came in the mail today. Three hundred fucking dollars. The sorry thing is that it's nothing compared to what the bill for my stay at Green Oaks and Medical City will be. Thank goodness for health insurance right?       Fuck I've washed my hands three times but I'm still smelling the coconut curry. Dammit.

       This is my favorite picture of my mom.  Actually this is the bottom corner of some random shot I found from my graduation.  I never noticed her there before.  But shortly after she died, I came across this picture and instantly broke down in tears.  I don't know why.  I guess it just captures everything I love and remember about her.  Seven months after this was taken, she was diagnosed with cancer.  Seven months later she died.  I really miss her.

       Well this has got to be a new record, waking up at 2am. And to think I've been bitching about waking up at 4 the last few nights..silly silly me. Maybe I should pop a half dozen or so ambiens and hope to be knocked out til noon, at which time my dad (who got in last night by the way) is wanting to go shopping for barstools for the new townhome. Grace said she'll be driving back up tomorrow morning since they got to see the fortune teller a day early or whatever. Apparently this mystical being knew her boyfriend (that would be me) was born in 1979, looks like his mom, and has been having trouble sleeping the last few weeks. Lucky guess. I also love her very much, am going to be very successful, and will be having back problems if I don't watch it. Oh and I'm kind of lazy right now and need to shape up. Sure whatever. I think it's all just a bunch of tomfoolery (heehee that's a funny word) but at least Grace is happy now, knowing that her boyfriend does indeed love her very very much (hey the guy said it so it must be true). God I'm such an ass  .      I tried to call Tay again earlier tonight. Honestly, why do I even bother? I wish I could step inside her head for just a few seconds to try and understand why she's acting and feeling the way she is. I just don't get it. I know I said some hurtful things a while back, but how could she just completely turn her back to me? How can she not realize how much I'm hurting right now and that I really need my friends and family. I don't get why she can't talk to me anymore. We've been through so much together..who else has been as close to her the last few years? Yet now she says she can't talk to me and that she needs her space. I have my own ideas as to why she's acting this way, but I'll keep them to myself. Right now all I know is that I miss her. I miss her a lot. It's like suddenly losing your best friend one day, and not knowing why. The other day I saw some pics of her out dancing on bars and hanging on guys. I guess this is the new wild and crazy Tay. I admit those pics made me a little jealous, but only because of the fact that those guys actually got to be around her. I'm supposed to be the best friend, yet over the past several months there just never seemed to be any time for me.      I can't wait to see Grace tomorrow. Sure I'll give her shit for "leaving me" to go see that damn fortune teller, but I'm so glad she's coming back a day early. It's pretty sickening how much we miss each other after just one day. I can just imagine everyone gagging right about now..and rightfully so. Fuckers. It's been nearly two years and yet it's like we get more and more disgustingly in love as each day goes by. But the real sick part is the fact that I don't think that's ever going to change. Yea we're sick bastards. Ok, t  ime for another ambien..

       Too tired to go to the gym..but I at least made it to Super Target and am now munching on these kickass cherries. I wish Grace had decided to spend the weekend with me rather than making the trip to Houston. Damn fortune teller. Also miss Tay like crazy and wish she'd talk to me. People get confused whenever I say stuff like that, but how can I not miss her? She's my best friend..or at least I thought she was. All I know is that if she were ever feeling as miserable as I am now, I'd be there for her..no matter what. Oh well.

        God I'm so fucking tired. I haven't slept more than 3-4 hours a night the last month or so. Even after taking two ambiens I still find myself waking up at 4am. This seriously sucks. To make matter worse, I really need to drag my ass to the gym later since it'll be closed tomorrow due to UTD's graduation ceremonies. Wonderful. Right now, going downstairs completely wears me out..the thought of skullcrushers and close-grip supersets really doesn't seem too appealing.     Grace is going to Houston this weekend with her dad and sis..to see a freaking "fortune teller." Yea yea I know that's not the only reason, but geezus is that  really  necessary? Ok I've bitched enough about this to her already so I'll just leave it at that.    I feel like buying something. Buying shit always makes me feel better. It's a temporary fix but who cares right? I want another pair of Pumas, though I honestly don't know if the one I want even exists. Maybe I'll go to Neimans later and look for these imaginary sneakers. I'm such a dumbass. I could also use a new pair of workout shoes..Shox are kind of overdone so maybe something else. It seems like every 90lb muscle-tee-wearing douchebag at the gym has a pair. You know the type..they walk around with their arms all flared out, acting as if their lats are just  that damn wide . They also only work chest and arms, but spend just as much time posing and flexing in front of the mirrors. Bench-pressing with their asses high up in the air, and then loading up the preacher curl rack to blast their awesome 13-inch guns..real annoying shit. I admit I'm not a real big guy (hell I honestly think I'm fat, even with a six-pack), but I respect the game, the lifestyle. Asshole pricks who go in acting like they're the shit because they can curl or press x amount of weight..damn that irritates me.    Ok, I'm getting off my ass. I need to do something. Cherries sound good right about now. I guess I'll go wander around Super Target for a while before hitting the gym. Some people are supposed to come over later to fix some shit in my house, so I gotta be home for that. Maybe I can convince someone to go watch a movie with me later. Not sure if anything good is opening this weekend, but I do know that I don't want to see The Village. Jon said it blows.. and Jon's always right.

       Here's my six-month-old baby. I swear all she does is whine and shit, whine and shit, and uhm shit some more. heheh I but I love her. It's amazing how something so small can shit so much. Oh and holy crap her farts stink! She gives new meaning to the term "silent but deadly." She's really a lot cuter but these are the best pics I could get at the moment.

       Well, after having such a shitty month I decided to start my own blog so I'd finally have a place to express all the crap I've been feeling inside. It's been a rough couple of weeks, and I honestly don't think things are going to pick up anytime soon. I hate feeling like this. I really do. My head hurts, my mind's in constant disarray, and I'm just physically and emotionally spent. Everyone tells me not to look at my depression as a sign of weakness, since it's a "chemical imbalance"   that's out of my control. But I just can't help but feel as if it's my own fault for feeling this way. I can't help it, I can't control it..but I should be able to, right? It's not fair that I'm unable to control the way I feel, the way I perceive the world around me.. The thought of having to rely on drugs in order to "stabilize" myself for the rest of my life just sickens me. My doctor compared it to people suffering from heart problems. They can't help it, and they too have to rely on meds. But I just don't see the connection. This is my mind we're talking about. This isn't a fucked up heart or thyroid or whatever..this is my fucking mind we're talking about. I should be in control dammit. Chemical imbalance or not, I should be able to dictate how I feel, how I act.. Being a slave to my own mind is so fucking ridiculous. One minute I'm okay, the next I'm feeling like complete shit. I hate this. I really really fucking hate this.       The last few weeks have been one hell of an eye-opening experience. Aside from my oh-so-wonderful stay at Green Oaks, I've been exposed to the harsh realization that concepts such as love and friendship can be so meaningless, so trivial. Never in my life have I ever so desperately needed the love and support of those closest to me. Yet in my darkest hour, the one person who I thought would always be there - who would always love and care for me - turns her back to me. I know I said some things that I shouldn't have, and that I should have expressed my feelings in a more calm and rational manner. But I can't control the way I feel. The emotional outbursts, the sudden breakdowns, the seemingly unrelenting pain..I don't want to feel this way but I can't help it. Why can't you see that? Why can't you understand? I know you're hurting from some of the things I've said, but why can't you just be there for me? No matter how confusing and difficult life gets, you don't turn your back on those you love and care about. You just don't.      Through it all, the lone bright spot (yes, there's actually been a bright spot) has been Grace. I know this hasn't been easy on her, but she's done nothing but love and support me. No one has ever loved or cared for me as much as her, and for that I'm eternally grateful. Without her, I probably wouldn't even be here writing this longass blog. Yea I know I bitch about not being able to see her as often as I'd like, but I really am thankful for every second I get to spend with her. God I love her. We recently had our first baby. Not a real baby of course, but a six-month-old kitten we adopted from the SPCA. The kitty formerly known as Benita (no offense if your name is Benita, but what the fuck kind of name for a kitten is Benita?), is now the super-hyper, oh-so-curious, sometimes naughty sometimes nice Bitsy. Betsy thinks she's named after her, but nahh I just thought Bitsy sounded cute. I tried to snap a few pics of her but I swear she has ADD. I managed to get a couple decent ones after a few dozen attempts. I'll post them up when I get around to it.      What else..hmm well my hard drive fucking took a shit yesterday, forcing me to waste even more money buying a replacement, I've been sitting on my ass chatting with vpatel and Jon all day long, I've actually stuck to a somewhat consistent workout schedule this week, my diet's been complete shit (fried chicken and indian food..I'm such a fucking pig), Betsy's in New York, I still haven't started studying for either micro or genetics, I tried ginger ale for the first time ever and actually liked it, laughed my ass off watching Harold and Kumar, had my fortune told by a freaky romanian tarot card reader at Grace's friend's party last weekend (seriously freaky shit), endured hours of mindnumbing karaoke in addition to overpriced food at Tay's party, discovered my garage door is fucked up, and uhmm did I mention eating? Ok, Grace should be here any second with some kfc (seriously) so that's it for now.
