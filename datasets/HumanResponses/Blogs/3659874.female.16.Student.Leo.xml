      I am in a kind of wierd mood today! I am blank on what to write today but I just felt that I needed to get on the computer. Not really have much to talk about write now cept beign at home is boring and I havent seen or talked to my friends in about two weeks and i hate being on my own( sometimes) unless im at home, well im going back to school-summer school-on monday which will be cool because i'll see everyone I havent seen and talk and it'll be cool. Maybe i will get a break from my pestering siblings that really is getting on my nerves right now- n-e wayz*******  Well I want to write but I am afraid to write what I want to write because I am kinda wondering if its okay to write it down so I'll debate on write it or not if I choose to write it I will in the next post! - next subjuect:dreams - what is up with weird dreams on the days that there are moonlight thingy shining on your face- weirdest dream i had was god cold play the violin- coolest one was about vampires draining blood from I dont know what, last night was shamu broke the swimming pool and drowned the parkin lots -dont comment on that-no wonder its called al LUNA-tic dream:luna means moon in spanish for those that dont know!-.- But I havent slept since Monday so I have been sleepy and waking up at three!!!!!!

      Whats the worst feeling ye has ever gotten? I think the worst feeling that there is when you get this crap from people and your on the verge of crying but you dont want to and your throat hurts and you cry either way! The coolest feeling that I have ever gotten is when I am on top of a rollercoaster and the feeling of coming down and feeling like your stomach is going to fall out its really cool. So far thats all thats happened! well you guys to whoever reads this I will see you laters......                                PinkKitty

      you know that feeling that you get when you stop and just take a minute to breathe and all of a sudden you think and review your whole life and you think about the good and bad and at the end when you finish reviewing you come to the conclusion that your whole life just sux a**! I hate doing that and I do it all the time I focus on all the bad things that sux and you know you only look at the bad because its like you feel like you have done nothing in the simple years that you have lived so you feel that all this time you have accomplished nothing so you look at what you think will be your present and you see yourself ending up like your parents and you freak out! you just straight out freak so you start doing the things that you would like to be doing but youre so scared of doing because if you do them people look at you and think your crazy-though secretly they wish they could have the guts you do and if ever they do them too-but they dont because everybody is scared of everybody! Have you ever noticed how a group of people revolve around one person if you look at that person you see how everybody worships her/him, how everything is supposed to be their way so if you dont do what they say they see you as a threat to them so they turn and give yu the cold shoulder kind of sux because later on their not going to have anybody and you will be the only one who will be there but you'll look back and you return the favor as once they did to you! it really sux i guess well that is it see ya laters                              PinkKitty Chaos

      you know when someone is stressed out because of: too much work or not enough work or siblings or even money etc- and the person is so stressed out and she/he cant help it and its seems like pms or sms, but it isnt that its just everything that is going around them and you think theyre just picking on you because they can and if you try to talk to them they get pissed of at you for the smallest reasons -which of course sucks but you have to deal with it becasue you cant do anything about until their little phase is over, again sucks- so to get away from you yourself trying not to get stressed you go and sit on the computer and write long words of nothingness which of course only makes sense to you and the people who feel like beign in an understandble mood and they know exactly whats going on and there like yep and it sucks! reason I wrote this none I just felt that I had to write this becasuse it seemed like a good topic at the time but hey everybody gets stressed once in a while so thats it i guess ttyl-         ///////Chaoticgirl///////--------------------hello to kitty and tlpdancer and satan on the bus and jtbam phkain&joceand dryce-and everyone else that i havent seen in a while lotsofluv -you know who!
