      Who knew you had to pour the water in the BACK of the coffee maker ..not into the front onto the coffee grounds.  I didn't.  Saw Farenheigt 911 last night.  It's easily the scariest movie I've ever seen.  IF it's true then what Michael Moore has done has shown us that Bush not only knew about 911 before hand, but that he wanted it to happen so it could financially benefit his Daddies investing friends.  Apparently the Bushes and the BinLadens have been friends for years and years.  The movie made me sick to watch.  It poked alot of fun at Bush himself, however the biggest joke was leaving the theatre and realizing "the jokes on us".  If you love America ... see this movie and then ...do something about it.  Basically if you're going to take away one thing from this movie its "vote for anyone but Bush this coming election"  I read Margaret Cho's blog today and watched a video on broad-band about her involvement in the Million Woman March on Washington.  Seeing Margaret hang out with other people I love like Jeanie Garafallo, Wanda Sacks and Ani DiFranco only made me feel warmer and fuzzier inside. WELL OF COURSE THEY'RE FRIENDS !  So tomorrow is Pride NYC. I haven't been in 2 years.  I was in Amsterdam last year and couldn't make it.  The year before I went for the first time with Roger and Peter and Ralphael.  I'm already anticipating how insane it is.  This year I'm going with Jax, Drew and my boy Nicky.  School sucks. I will never take another Math class again in my lifetime. Maryellyns class is amazing.  Finally at 23 I'm learning hisory I should have been paying attention to when I was 16.   I'm supposed to go to Ireland next month with the family.  I've gotten alot of books to read, lets hope that will be enough.  Joe is annoying me.  He still won't come out to his parents and his "new boy he's seeing" sounds like a loser and Joe wants to write this kids college essay for him.  I hope Joe realizes his mistakes soon.  Big audition for Cabaret coming up.  This is non negociable.  Nicky is sicky.  I probably gave it to him.  He's by far the most amazing boy I've ever had in my life.  He's a walking miracle.  I think love is when you can look in someone's eyes and you can see the YOU that they see IN YOU in their eyes.  And in a way, you're kinda falling in love with yourself because you realize you love them.  I had no control over falling. I just realized the next day that I was completly gone for him ... in a week I was more sure about him then I've ever been about any other boy that I've known for 6 months.  The first time I laid eyes on him, I was overwhelmed by his smile, his eyes and of course how tall he was.  The first time our hands brushed and he pulled away from me, I knew ... the only thing I wanted was to hold his hand.  My life is kind of rediculous right now ... but I wouldn't have it any other way.  Love to ALL.  BREN
