       rain on my parade   it's raining tonight. the weather coincides with the mood. my patience runs thin. it's  3 am once again .   we are so quick to judge the world around us, yet fail to reflect on the role we play in it. the quickest to point a finger is usually the one who sees no fault in themselves. i wonder if making the effort to reveal their faults would create progress or pour salt in an already open wound. would that person own up to theirs? or would they simply cast you aside as well?  being caught in the middle, i often wonder what possible acts could mend this conflict within my family. all he seems to see is the menace they bring while i can only see them for what i've known them to always be-- just a family with its imperfections. often, i've been tempted to unleash all feeling of resentment built over months on him... why can't he just let it go? why did he have to stick his damn nose in?   in doing so, however, i may become the very monster i wish to be rid of. just in this brief moment, i loathe my brother for what he's done to me.   // links:  just deal - /  urlLink http://www.buddhistinformation.com/dealing_with_resentment.htm

       a sleepless night   it's difficult to sleep when it's hot. it's even worse when there's too much on your mind. sometimes i fear falling asleep on such occassion. there is no prediction of what dream will be manifested. and normally, it becomes of no use, and i awake mid-sleep from a nightmare--usually enough to keep me awake the rest of the evening. if only the myth of dying in your dream were true, i would have been dead years ago.   ugh, it's nearly  three a.m.  and there is no sign of returning to sleep. my pug follows me to my computer even at this ungodly hour, but only to sleep at my feet.     if only life was that simple...  unconditional love mixed with a good night's sleep. complexity is over-rated.   //link: interpret your dream -/  urlLink http://home.wanadoo.nl/vanvugt/

       a separate peace   john knowles created this parable about a friendship gone awry. at the beginning of the novel, he states an underlying theme:  nothing endures, not a tree, not love, not even death by violence.   though this book has seen its time with me, -- evidence can be found on the folded pages and water spots from hot baths-- that simple line in text has only become apparent this last weekend. does  nothing endure ? the proof can be found in our lives. i have had friendships become simple acquaintances. there is always love that becomes lost. there  was  a death that caused pain.  if we know that all things pass, why do we hold on so tight? why do we keep grips to things that have passed, causing ourselves more distress? why do we stop living?   // links: the novel-/  urlLink http://www.novelguide.com/aseparatepeace

       was that supposed to be my destiny?   my skates took stride with an olympian (or to-be olympian). i took a glance at her, and two things crossed my mind. the first was a simple admiration of the skill that is beyond the surface. for a moment, i was awestruck. the following thought was not as pleasant. could i have done what she had? was that supposed to be me?  i was on that road....   the what-ifs certainly strikes a chord when we cross its path. the decisions we make change the course of our lives-- some are minor adjustments, some are drastic. but they are the path we chose to be best for us at the time. though moments like these-- where our destiny comes into question, where the what-ifs live-- come around, there should be a simple yet resounding message to keep surfaced:  we are who we are.  at least that's what i choose to tell myself... .  and last night, i scored twice. the second came from  her . that may not be the road i travel on, but for a split second, i tasted the fine wine.     // links: to-be olympian-/  urlLink http://www.usa-womens-icehockey.com/BrookeWhitney.htm

       changes are...   inevitable in our lives. there are some we resist to our death about -- i have a friend who resists the thought of technology! bah-humbug, i say to that! there are some that we welcome with open arms -- the passing of the 80s leg warmers would be a good candidate for this--, but there are definitely some we hoped would never come about. the most difficult change, at least for me, is the passing of a great thing.   the change i dreaded became a reality tonight --my pseudo older siblings (two of my closest friends) have decided to move to san fransisco. they say its only for two years, but if all things factored in, i'm sure their move there is permanent... and they will no longer be a short drive or phone call away for dinner. and in a matter of months, the friendship of today will dissolve into something minimal-- emails and instant messaging that will dwindle in amount.   i find myself hoping that they wouldn't leave, but know that this is the best for them and wouldn't want anything less than that for wonderful people. it is difficult however, to remain unselfish, to refrain them from begging to stay. maybe for my sanity's sake i'll make that request just once.  just to feed that selfish side of me.   and just like that, there went a great thing.   // links:  80's leg warmers -/  urlLink a tribute to this fashion disaster

        Â the glory of friendship...   is not the outstretched hand, nor the kindly smile, nor the joy of companionship; it is the spiritual inspiration that comes to one when he discovers that someone else believes in him and is willing to trust him with his friendship. --- Ralph Waldo Emerson   it is intriguing that mr. emerson writes this about friendship, not love. the above does shed a positive light on friendship. many of us can relate, i'm sure-- specially those who've had their hearts broken by love. our friends-- the ones that find no fault in you, the ones that feel the need to avenge you when you've been wronged, the ones that see the face of your true pain-- are  always  there when we need it.   i once believed that your love can be your best friend. but in reading the above from mr. emerson, it's come to light that such a belief holds no water. if love is truly based on friendship, there would be less broken hearts in the world and more fairy tales come true. the truest of friends would rather walk through fire than cause the other such anguish.    if love and friendship were the same, love would never come last. love would never be made to wait just because it is not the right time to make that commitment. if love can be your best friend, there would be no lies.   for those of you who have found love and friendship in one person, i envy you.   // links:   the works of emerson -/ urlLink http://www.rwe.org/

       what does it take...   to truly change a person? does a death change a person? does loss? does sadness? why is it not inherent in any culture to change ourselves for the better? some people are unlucky enough to know that they need to overhaul their attitudes, beliefs and actions for the ones they care for, yet they  still  continue on with their ways.   i've heard many stories of people that change only after a loss. i'm sure some of you have heard this one: a couple breaks up... a guy or girl gets on his or her knees and begs forgiveness of the other-- promising that he or she will change his/her ways, then acknowledges that they've been an ass all this time and knew it... but just didn't change it.   why does it have to go that far for someone to realize their wrong-doings to another? it seems that a person should inspire you to be a better person. do we just get comfortable--become creatures of habit and neglect the essentials of life?  // links:  find a better person -/  urlLink http://www.match.com

       pieces of me   one would laugh at the amount of times i ponder life's quirks when i'm shopping. i bought myself a hat today. one that was exactly like my sister's--well almost exactly, i got a different color so that we could tell ours apart.   but it just goes to show how much of me is really pieces of people i love. though the hat may be a material symbol of this, i know that so much of me is part of everyone else. i have my mother's patience, my father's temper, my brothers' pride and stubborness and my sisters' issues with men. from my friends, i take mannerisms, sayings and some attitudes.   i wonder if i'm the only one who finds this to be true. could it be that this is the way we are all interconnected to each other?  hmmm... wonder if this hats looks good on me.   // links:  the hat i bought -/  urlLink pfc cap in black

       all about simple pleasures   it's not about a big production, the best things of life are in fact the simplest things. so many times, the small gestures of people are overlooked. a friend of mine finds that one of the greatest pick-me-ups is receiving a handwritten letter. today, my sister noticed me doing some work on my computer, and she prepared me some tea without my request.   it was then i realized the beauty of the simplicity. and in an instant, the day almost seemed like just what the doctor ordered-- simple gestures to restore my faith in people's kindness. like most things, it does exist when we see beneath the surface.   // links:  for tea lovers -/  urlLink http://www.teavana.com/

       perfection in imperfections   in remembering the fondest memories of people, i always find that what come to mind the most is their imperfections. no, not those kind of imperfections. i mean the kind that make you laugh because  they  would be the only ones who could ever do something so.... imperfect .  my best friend has this distinctive laugh that was the most annoying thing in the world (at least to me). but these days, whenever i hear it, i know that something has made him ridiculously happy. my little sister, often with a mouth the size of the entire west coast, always says the most inappropriate things at the inappropriate time. but in doing so, she manages to always make me laugh no matter how stern i become. those traits in character are simply irreplaceable.   my family, whose picture resides alongside the definition of procrastinators, gave me a little over twelve hours of notice of their arrival for an extended weekend visit. though it has caused a bit of a turmoil, their visit has been a blessing. in a time where i felt the need of an escape from the torture of my own thoughts, they have come to my aid. that in this weekend, i can forget what clouds my thoughts. and for that, there is nothing that could be more perfect.   // links:   art of procrastination:  urlLink http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~john/procrastination.html

       god was bowling last night...   and the power went out. no power = no internet. it was sort of a blessing. anything that i put on screen at the time was moronic... and when a great one came along, poof--a reminder of the dark ages.  'nuff bitchin...   aside from the obvious reasons why liquor and drugs are banned, there is an underlying idea that makes them such a social faux pas. not being sober means that the likelyhood of us indulging our inhibitions increases. for example, imagine how many marriages have ended due to one drunken mistake. i wonder how much of our global overpopulation is caused by drunken, one-night stands. how much of our lives would be a regret if we became so...uninhibited?  i'm not saying that indulging our deepest desires is all terrible. sometimes it is something that allows us to break a barrier--to give us the nerve to say something to someone or to give us the courage to finally make that move. the things we say, however... well, that's a  different  story.   //links: the storm-/  urlLink http://www.komotv.com/stories/31777.htm

       behind closed doors...   we are all different people. these are the moments when we are truly most ourselves. it is when our frustrations apparent and our true nature becomes transparent. when no one is looking, the facades fall. and in an instant, the fears we hide, the hate we supress and the pain we run from all are right infront of our face.   this is one of the most difficult times for me. often times, i hide behind such walls it becomes daunting to see who i truly am and what i truly want. it's amazing how we sometimes get lost in our own selves to keep our lives stable. after all, when things were close to what i saw as perfection, why would i rock my boat?   what truly scares me now, my  biggest fear , is getting to a point and realizing that it wasn't what it was imagined to be. however, the catch 22 in the situation is that we certainly can't stop living. so what is one to do?  //links: catch 22 -/  urlLink  the cliffnotes version

       on a less serious note (for tonight)   what is your addiction? a visitor here on my blog, vadergrrrl, (she's definitely from the dark side!) is a collector of bad ass characters- darth maul, magneto, etc. you see why i like this girl?  anyway, my vice...  now, don't laugh ... is quite typical of the female stereotype. if i gave three guesses, surely with one of those you'd hit it right on the head. yes, it's bags!  i have half a closet's worth of purses!!! even i was astounded at that fact. i only happen to come across that measurement when i was trying to finally unpack all my purses and put them in a nicely organized fashion.   no, i don't always buy them. i acquire most of them from people feeding my addiction because they don't know what else to get me for occassions. and i love it! i don't what it is, and am incapable of stopping. sigh... i'm such a girl at heart. thank god, it's not shoes... well... not yet, at least.  you got any strange collections? tell me. and if you're a bag lover like myself, please share if you have tons. solidarity in numbers! now here comes the mockery....   //link: LV Bags -/  urlLink the holy grail of hand bags

       satisfaction and contentment   what is being content with life mean? is that what a marraige, house, 2.5 kids, garage and lawnmower is supposed to bring?   what if our lives have no real end point other the obvious? are we ever really supposed to be content? or are we always suppose to work towards something for the bettering of our lives? suppose you graduated from college, does that mean you need to go to graduate school... and so on?  if we find satisfaction, why do those who haven't call us simply content-- content with the implication that we have stopped living or trying? has there ever been a moment in your life where you say to yourself that you could have everything you could ask for? and if you ever find that moment, it is important to see what you do have. it's difficult to say whether it does last. but if you see what is around you, it'll make it easier to find when/if you lose it.   //links: the rolling stones song -/  urlLink http://www.thesonglyrics.com/r_song_lyrics/therollingstones_lyric2.html

       the two faces of people   so many times we face strangers -even friends- without a clue whether the smile on their face comes with some unkindly thoughts behind it. how do you know what the person across from you is truly thinking?  i'm sure there have been times where someone's told you that they're having fun, when they're truly not. we've all done it. at that moment, our face tells the fallacy, and the moment we have our backs turned our stories turn from fantasy to nightmare. it seems to be part of our human nature.   sometimes we do it out of spite. sometimes we simply do it to keep from hurting the other person's feelings. but do you ever think if it would have been better for them to know the truth? what if they found out what you truly thought or told another?   what  excuse  could you come up with for that tainted moment in time? when i got caught in one, i had none. and if it were me, i'd rather know the truth.   //links: excuses to miss work -/  urlLink http://www.mentalsoup.com/mentalsoup/misswork.htm

       past relationships. closed door or open book?   do you choose to know who has come before you and all the details?    do you believe that such information is in the past and should remain there? and is omission truly considered a lie?   so many things can reside in the gray areas. personally, i find it easier to know the entire truth. mainly because i have this great fear of being in the dark.  as one of the youngest in my family, i was always one of the last to know. i hated that!  of course, that's not always possible, but i can hope. will it be something that is important in a relationship for me? probably. to love someone, they say, is to give yourself fully...  history and all .  the double standard of my life, however, is even as much as i've loved someone, i still haven't been able to be the open book i should be. maybe i didn't love him enough to show him me.   //links: books -/  urlLink www.amazon.com

       the power of music   there are very few forces in this world ( well good ones, at least ) that can simply make someone break down in tears in an instant. and there are some moments, where music can simply strike that right chord.   as i drove to the bank a couple of miles away, i flipped to the cd changer.  damn radio commercials will still be on by the time i get to the bank.  i wasn't aware what was coming on, and in the current mood i was in, it was the most opportune moment to feel the power of that particular song. in a split second, i was balling like a child. tears fell quickly and in abundance. my eyes blurred and i quickly had to find a place to pull my car over.  though i could have probably put a quick end to it by simply skipping to the next track, there was nothing to do but listen. my heart wanted to cry, and i let it.   my knowledge of music is minute compared to the music lovers i know. most of the time, it is difficult to relate to that passion. i simply don't speak their language much. but in that moment, there was understanding.  there is an understanding with me why people are so empassioned to be musicians, or simply to love this art.   after running my errands, i went home and listened to more. there were a few more tears shed. it was accompanied by some smiles and replayed memories. the best part of it all is that i knew that i wasn't alone.   //links: a study on the power of music-/  urlLink http://www.thepowerofmusic.co.uk/keypoints.htm

       true talent or feeding an ego?   when someone tells you that you have "x factor" at something, do you instantly believe them? how much water does one person's opinion truly hold? what about two? what if it's a trusted friend?   how do you know it's true talent... or they're just feeding your ego because they can't hurt your feelings ( and tell you that you truly suck )? for someone who's afraid at failing--at disappointing those who expect the world, it's difficult to take a leap of faith on simple opinion. it seems like a great feat to break from the mold and rumble the grounds of comfort.   but... what if?   //links: life's ten biggest regrets-/  urlLink http://www.members.shaw.ca/rhys2000/top10.html

       guarded hearts   if you've been hurt, it is only natural to be guarded with feelings. but how many chances do you give someone before you simply walk away? it would be so much simpler if there is, like algebra, a formula that we are supposed to use to figure this out.  not that it would help me, since i am terrible at math.   when do we factor in how much we've invested, how much joy it brings to our life versus how much grief it can bring us? and how much does the role of following your heart actually play in our reasoning? no matter our age, i doubt this kind of decision gets any easier. the only difference between over the years is how much we factor our hearts in to our equations.   is this how we turn into old maids...?  //links: old maid card game -/  urlLink http://www.pagat.com/passing/oldmaid.html

       in honor of the day...   my father and i have had a better relationship over the past few years. i'm not sure what caused the transition, but i'm sure part of the reason is that his absence in my life plays a role in it. i see my father as much as four times a year for a few days to as little as one time a year for a few hours. his business keeps him abroad  ALL  the time and my mom and siblings live a few hours plane ride from me.   though my father is far from an ideal one, i realize that like most parents he tries his best. he provides for his family, even at his age. approves of most any man for his daughters as long as we are happy. even when we've committed wrongs, he can't stay angry. my father seeks our approval at every corner and is even quite sappy about it.   it pains me to not be able see him on "his" days. i missed his birthday this year, and now on father's day. as i get older so does he. the time i have with him dwindles. i hope, however, he enjoys the requested " bling " i sent home for him (it's his new addiction. he wants to look and live in  bling ). sorry, dad, couldn't afford ferrari you asked for this year.  maybe on christmas...   //links: ferraris -/ urlLink http://www.ferrari.com/FWorld/fw/index.jsp

       greatest surprises when you least expect it   a couple of days ago, i spent a greater part of an afternoon arguing with a friend that  love  was absolutely baloney-- that love dies instantly because we are the most fickle creatures on this planet. i'd recap the argument, but his claim says that i have been jaded (insert valley girl " duh ") by the world i live in today. to be perfectly logical and objective, he has his points, and i have mine. it's safe to assume, our hard heads came to a draw on the subject.  yesterday, however, there was a little bit of faith restored in my heart on the subject. my friend, lester,  received an unexpected gift from this woman he is totally in love with. he hadn't heard from her in two weeks, and was quite disappointed at the thought. but  zoiks!  there was this gift from her awaiting him at home. he bragged about it in the morning, of course, but i was happy for him. maybe there is hope after all....   //links: lester's plans to sweep her off her feet-/  urlLink http://www.terminalfreedom.com/loveblog/loveblogger.html

       are you  twinkie material?    years ago, based on the urban legend that twinkies (yes, the hostess goodies) have decades of shelf life and will last through a nuclear winter, i created myself the  twinkie material theory . this theory is something i use to separate people--mostly my friends-- into two different groups.  the ones who are simply passers by. or the ones that stay for the ride.  so, here's my theory: people have a center, a core to their nature. some people have pea- nuts  for a center, some have seeds. some have a cremey filled center. but some (and a few at that) have a twinkie cremey filled center.. like a twinkie, these people are genuinely good and always satisfying.  get your minds out of the gutter. i didn't mean --that-- kind of satisfying. oh wait, that was my head in the gutter.  the difference, however, between a normal cremey filled center and a twinkie one is that the twinkie ones stay true to its nature. through the times that life throws at them, the twinkie candidates stay deliciously good and honorable-- where as the rest become rotten and jaded over time.   and yes, i know that ho-hos are filled with the exact same creme. but that would be derogatory.  hehe, i crack myself up..... ok, i'm done laughing.   the fact that my theory is based on an urban legend probably debunks my theory by default. but the reasoning holds together. unfortunately, even i don't live up to my own theory. i hope more of the world does...  //links: the twinkie legend -/  urlLink http://www.snopes.com/food/ingredient/twinkies.htm

       it must be that time...   when the planets and stars align just right to cause my world to hit a low point.   this past holiday weekend has been spent with friends, family, out-of-town guests and animals, and i believed most of it would resemble a sense of enjoyment and home. but sadly, none of it was such. i distinctly remember feeling indifferent for most of the weekend. and if i wasn't, there was spite seeping through my veins. it took almost all my energy to simply act like my world was a ray of sunshine.  there has been a sadness hovering over me for some time now -- the feeling of despise and the indifference to the world. i haven't come to a conclusion on what i have turned into: an ice princess, dooms day girl or a plain ol' whiney bitch. it is one of the most cruel things in the world  not  to feel.   the thought of putting a knife to skin to check if i still bleed crossed my mind. the idea quickly faded at the thought of seeing blood. in the midst of rush hour traffic, all i could think about was playing a game of chicken with a semi. obviously the semi would win, but i wondered if i would feel indifferent enough to just go through with it or if there would be a slight chance for fear to set in. the latter would at least provide me a feeling other than spite.   i wonder why i can't cry anymore. and if i knew how to sleep without meds. i wonder why they call the age of 50 golden.   is that the pot at the end of the rainbow?    //links: game of chicken -/  urlLink http://www.gametheory.net/Dictionary/Games/GameofChicken.html

       all quiet on the western front   so my brother and i have had our bouts over the last few....... months.....and last night ( tonight, for those who catch this shortly after i post it ) we called it peace over some fireworks.   my sister-in-law wasn't too thrilled at the thought of fireworks for the 4th of july. in fact, she thought we'd set the neighborhood on fire if we did light some. just for spite and knowing the joy it would bring to my brother's day, i went to an indian reservation in the afternoon and came with fireworks in hand. she could say nothing about it.   i had a huge pack of fountains, artillery shells, and rockets. the rockets were for me. and we lit everything. so did the rest of the neighbors. this was my peace offering to my brother, and it was a trip down memory lane. my brother was the first person who taught me how light one of those bottle rockets.   the evening couldn't have been more perfect. there was peace for the night

       out of the ashes   so i've been in this funk lately ( see previous post for reference ). one couldn't really understand why. and so out of the depths of my condition, i did what any girl could do to pick myself up.  i shopped .   however, what i shopped for was more than your ordinary trip to the mall... well, it was a mall--an auto mall. my put put, gas guzzling suv has been traded in for a shiny, almost new, still gas guzzling, sports car. i have rationale for this, and it wasn't purely on impulse. my suv had lost half its value in two years, it was overly large for what i needed it for, and it was simply blood sucking to have it serviced. this car, without specifics, will hold its value and feeds my need to speed. ( being from LA, driving under 70mph is just ungodly slow ) and i got a great deal on it.  in any case, i feel alive... like a phoenix -- hence the title of this post. it also coincides with the fact that the car's color is named: phoenix yellow. but imagine a mustard yellow, shiny and sleek.    //links: auto trader-/  urlLink http://www.autotrader.com

       looking at life   from a different angle can often cause us moments of insanity along with moments of bliss. this past weekend, i found a few instances where i stepped from outside myself and saw someone who could truly live. this person was indeed a stranger to me--someone who let go of fear of life and lived.   while i was in new york this weekend, all i could think was that everyone around me seemed to be just living. and for once, that was enough for me. it was a glimmer of hope that has been missing for awhile.   maybe i just need to get away more often.  links:// see ny -/  urlLink http://citypass.com/

       it's been awhile...   since i've been able to blog. my laptop is undergoing surgery and recovery. that damn thing goes with me everywhere, and its taken its toll on the poor thing. email and 'net access has been severely limited. please pray for its safe return from the techie dudes.   yesterday, i drove to the university district to grab a dick's deluxe cheeseburger for dinner. ( western washington residents are familiar with this landmark ) there are very few times that i stop and admire the beauty of the seattle skyline, but when i do, there is a sense of awe that comes over me. the city is gorgeous. it is a major metropolitan yet there is a pleasant mixture of nature-- the waters of lake union, bridges that float on the waters of lake washington, trees and homes on queen anne hill. there is a contrast between the "eastside" and "westside" (referring to which side of lake washington you live in. i live and prefer the eastside, but that's one girl's opinion)... but like all things in life.... there is a yin and yang--both its main purpose, to bring balance.   comparing new york and seattle would be like comparing apples and oranges, but since new york is the big apple, i prefer the orange of seattle's sunsets. maybe it's just me who holds such preference ( my friend lester prefers the women of new york, but that's lester. hehe ) , but i've lived the fast paced life before. i grew up in southern california where the pace is as fast as the cars that drive on the freeway.   in metropolitans like ny and la, it is easier to get caught in the moment and maybe get caught doing something you wish you hadn't done. i also found it easier to lose yourself. though i still haven't truly come into my own yet, it seems more acceptable here in seattle. people are quicker to accept you just the way you are, without much judgement in how the layer of your clothes look on you. it's acceptable that you enter a beautiful restaurant like The Met, in jeans and a t-shirt--suppose they only care that you can pay the bill.   i expect that i won't be living here for my entire life. there is some part of me that wants to experience the other cultures of america and the world. but i'd have to say, if someone asks me where home is, seattle will always be my one true home.

       the power of a kiss   it is portrayed to us that a kiss is one of the most powerful and intimate things two people can share. we see it all the time. the fairy tales like sleeping beauty and snow white show that a kiss can break the curse and wake someone from a coma. the first matrix showed that her kiss could bring him back from the dead.  the land of the sitcoms brings us tension to be relieved  by locking lips--  will they kiss or won't they?!  in pretty woman, she didn't want to kiss him on the lips because it would make her fall in love with him.  it seems only natural that the real life expecations of a kiss ( mostly emphasized on a first kiss ) is quite high. but have you ever had one of those kinds of kisses-- the kind that make your knees weak and give you the urge to write love ballads? there is always doubt that the portrayal of such kind of element in life is simply a tale and is isolated with the romantics.   i think many would agree that a person's first ever true kiss does nothing but make you smile for a week straight. as an adult, it is difficult to replicate. but sometimes, there is one that comes along that sweeps you off your feet, runs electricity through your veins and truly touches your soul-- no matter if you are male or female. after that, the only thing that seems to occupy our thoughts is kissing that person again. though the feeling may fade over many kisses, i believe that such a moment is something those two people will always share, even past a demised relationship.   we may not live in a fairy tale, but for a few moments, ( seconds, minutes or hours, depending on where and how it happens.. hehe ), it's nice to float on air.   links:// melly's kiss -/  urlLink  http://jseb.jonstewart.net/fic/melly_kiss.html

       i'm still without...   my laptop. the manufacturer told me there was a repair that would cost six hundred bux on it. i nearly took the tech support person's head off when i heard that. but, with a calm and collected voice, i reasoned with her that this damage was caused by their previous repair-- which it truly was. and i hope they fixed it without charge. the repair status on the site claims that they've shipped it back. hopefully it will arrive soon.  anyway, i went home to see my family in southern california this weekend. actually, i went for a few reasons: i haven't been home for awhile, it was my neice's sixth birthday, and my cousin from toronto was in town. there was a lot of family time spent this weekend, along with sitting in traffic. but it comes at a time where it is welcome. one of the beautiful things about returning home to my parents' is the feeling of being a child. there is breakfast when i awake and mom offers to do my laundry. the best perk of all is when dad offers a few bucks for us girls to go shopping at the mall.   my sister, cousin and i would never say no to such an offer. we went hog wild--like teenagers, we scoured the malls for great deals and played dress up at stores because we could! the nostalgia in the air was priceless to the three of us. there is a reminder, however, that i have turned into an adult. rather than blowing the money gifted, i allowed myself only a little pleasure of something i needed-- a new bathing suit -- then stored the rest in my savings. ....  sigh ....
