      Over the time I've gone through many blogs. The thing is that they all sux. Like my brother says, " See .. they would be cool,but the suckiness is may more noticable.

   On the topic of not normal things, my day fits the description. It started off with me waking up at 5:45 in the morning thinking that i had missed x-country practice which i missed for 2 years in a row. Long after i scurried of out bed and got dressed did i notice that it was 5:45 AM. As most of you know .. im lazy, so i sorta got undressed and went back to bed. The second.. (yes second) time that i woke up it was 7:10 and i had 50 minutes to mess around before practice officially started. I stretched, drank a glass of lemonade, and put on a pair of shoes that didnt fit at all. Little did i know that the first practice wasnt going to be small like i thought but a 4 and a half mile long sweaty run. During the run i kept on thinking why why... did i chose to run with the stupid varsity team. All of them steeping over 6 ft with me clockin in at a nice 5'8". It may not seem alot but 4 inches more  in stride length adds up. As we were all running around with shirts flailling around of course a couple of hot girls walk by us. Of course the main varisty guy wants to make a full of us so starts singing this song that we all follow with sounding as if its boot camp that we were registered in and not just a normal x-country team. By the time we got back to the highschool i was dead and gasping for my new york tap water (Disani)that i gulched down probably under a minute. But remember i said this wasnt a normal day so what could top off everything that iv talked about so far. O.. i know , more strenuous excersises. As our coach told us all to lay down for 100 sit-ups. I rememberd 3 months back when i was putting my name down on the list of sign ups for x country and all i could do was regret. After we finally finished the 100 sit-ups of course we had to do pushups. I mean everyone just wants to have ripped arms and a ripped stomach. So we sat there doing pushups. Down ... up ... Down ... up. Over and over again. I frankly didnt care anymore i was so beat from the run and the whole exercise i just tried what all the highschoolers did. That was genius on my behalf. I decided to start to not care and just do them at my own pace.. and my own level.  (Genius idea i tell u .. genius) After practice was finally over i went home and fell asleep for like 2 hours. from 12-6 i watched a street ball compitition on the T.V which was mad cool i must say. Its the first time in awhile i was actually able to kick back and not worry bout anything. ex. - some girl, problems, homework , or many other things.  In the process of doing this i made some food and then fell asleep again * (remember im a lazy kid)  When i woke up needless to say it was like 8 o clock and my neighbor wanted to do fireworks , and we played basket ball and some other stuff. But to top off my wierd day for the next hour i walked around with my shoes on my knees chasing anyone i could find with the look of a midget. It was grand fun, and that was my day. :->

Stay tuned for ... TOMORROW!
