       Bars are the best and worst places in the world. I just returned from having lunch in a local sportish bar. I say sportish bar and not sports bar because it walks the line of being a sports bar but yet really feels like a neighborhood bar set in a downtown setting, but anyway I was having lunch. I just finished setting up the rig for the Metallica show tonight and was in need of some greezzzy bar food to settle me in for the lack of musicality and overall aural abuse of the show later. Yeah you guessed it, They suck! Ask me later, I'll give a thousand and one reasons why, but anyway; again. In bars, especially during the afternoon hours, you can listen to and take part in the greatest pseudo-intellectual conversations. Today, I took part in a conversation with a corporate type, completely sauced on his lunchbreak, and a want to be writer/comedian bumming at a local comedy club and submitting books for publication, to no avail, also sauced at 12:30, about the place of unions in modern business, engineers with no ability to, really hands on, build anything, and the lack of experience and knowledge of the modern management types in general. Wow, that was a mouthful. It was really to bad everyone was talking out there ass. Even though I do have strong views on these subjects, I more often prefer to take the devil's advocate position whenever I am blessed with being in a situation such as this. I will jump on whatever side is most far away from rational thought, and argue like I'm GW trying to disembowel stem cell research for the sake of my .9% of the population ruling class, when in reality I have know idea what stem cell research is and can barely spell it, but I digress. So, anyway, I pretty much can't remember all of the clever, intellectual banter flying about the room, but I will tell you this much. Try it whenever can. Speaking of which, have you every met anybody that spoke like Charlie Parker played solos in the early days. Talked a lot, but never said anything. I do believe I have successfully done that in this post. So I will leave you with this last thought.  My pants are on fire, the chalkboard is blank, and all the little birds that have never seen Apocalypse Now are driving to Vegas for the weekend!

        This may possibly the most interesting reading anyone falls upon on the net or quite the opposite. In either case here we go.           I have been turned on to this idea by my room mate, who feels that my stories of both truth and fiction may fall to some interest, or maybe if I write them out here, she will not have to withstand another barrage of my babbling. So very soon, I will unleash on the world all that is the adolescent adventures of a middle-aged rock-n-roll drummer type with more low down mojo than a hippo on a diet of soulfood and refried beans.
