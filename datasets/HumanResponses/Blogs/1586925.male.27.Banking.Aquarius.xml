      I am heavily wrapped up in this  urlLink Net Riddle  thing.  My God, this thing is like crack for the higher brain.  You answer a riddle, then you're sent to another riddle, then a word puzzle, then a bad pun, and somehow you make money.  My brother, curse his black heart, showed me this last night and now I'm hooked.  I WILL be the one to decipher the whole thing.  Dammit, if I can understand the  urlLink Timecube  then I can get this.  Now if I can just figure out the pattern in O, TT, FF, and SS, then they tell me how to make a fortune in real estate with no money down, right?  Oh crap, I'm confusing the real world, the internet, and infomercials AGAIN.  Aaaagh!  Vile Net Riddle!  I will OWN you!

       Mr. Tofu Inc.   I imagine that it's like Mr. Coffee, only they would get Sadahara Oh to endorse them.  I wonder if this Mr. Tofu is any relation to  urlLink Kikko-Man ?   Handicapstuff.com.   I just love the "stuff" at the end.  Really hit the wall with domain names, haven't we?   Monkey Business Products.   "Hi, I'd like to place an order for an infinite number of typewriters."   Dick Chin Realty.   Uh-huh-huh-huh.  Seriously, I wonder how much business this guy gets just based on the Beavis & Butthead factor?  This is just further proof that Beavis & Butthead have ruined the name "Dick" forever.

      I'm not having a good day today, accident-wise.  Although, I guess if you are having lots of accidents, would that be good accident-wise or bad accident-wise?  Hmm.  Anyway, I got a paper-cut under my left thumbnail.  When I got home, our parrot decided to vent her frustrations on my other thumb.  Later, at dinner, I bit into a pizza crust that was just a little on the less-comfortable side of crispy, and get a huge painful scratch on the roof of my mouth.  The worst part was this was on the first slice, so it kinda ruined my enjoyment of the rest of the pizza.  Boy, these are problems people in sub-Saharan Africa dream about, huh?  "I received a minor but annoying cut at my cushy office job.  My exotic yuppie pet injured me.  My mouth is too soft for the giant pizza slice I stuffed in it."  I apologize at once for my insensitvity to all Ethiopians, where I am told I have quite a following.

      "Dreaming of You" by The Coral.  What can I say, I'm a sucker for songs with backup singers going "wah-oooooo".  I'm pretty much a sucker for backup singers, when you get right down to it.  And not just to back up 'singers' per se; I think any activity is made more fun with the addition of harmonized vocals.  When I'm in my cubicle collating stuff, I want some Pips backing me up with some "wah-oooo"s, "ba-doom"s, and maybe a "sh-doop" or two.    My boss: "How's that report going?" Me: "The report's coming along just fine.  Isn't that right, Pips?" The Pips: "He's gonna hand the report in tomorrow.    Hoo-hoo!"  Where was I?  Oh, on the Pips rant again.  Anyway, go Kazaa that song, then briefly consider buying the whole album in the store, you thieving bastards.    And yeah, I first heard it on Scrubs.  I'm a loser who gets his music from Must-See-TV.  Well, I can't very well get it from MTV, now can I?  ZING!

      So I'm home sick today with a bad sore throat.  It's been going around the office, spread by people who would come in if they had the Black Death.  I guess you have to admire their dedication (of course, they're also paid  a lot more  then me, but I don't complain, just observe).  Me, I'm a big weenie.

       Robots of Mars Inc.   I don't know what they do, but I've gotta get in with this company.  I live for robots, as long as we're talking ones that transform into Walther P38s or Corvettes and not the ones that put airbags in your Camry.  And I saw all those stupid Mars movies a couple years ago, even John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars.  I should get something for that.   Team Jesus and Motorsports Evangelism .  Hanna-Barbara needs to take a look at this.  NASCAR-driving evangelists!  Who could presumably, if called upon by the Lord, solve mysteries!  This could be bigger than Jabberjaw.   Western States Fire Apparatus Inc.   There's a certain charm in the vagueness of their name.  "Western States".  Which ones?  West of where exactly?  And "Fire Apparatus"--starting them or putting them out?  Somehow I envision a Amazon.com-esque clearinghouse of dry twigs and old newspapers.   Matrix Electroceuticals Ltd.   Uh-oh.   Ninja Auto Body .  "We have put an end to the scraping of your broken fender, Mr. Gerry-san.  Your car will sail noiselessly through the night like wind over rice paper."

      I don't know whether it's the aura of raw sexual power I exude or pure coincedence, but while I've been at my current job assignment (approx. 10 months) two women in my department have gotten pregnant (that I know about, heh heh).  There's only about a dozen women in my office, half of whom are past child-bearing age, so it seems like something of a statistical anomaly.  One gave birth about 2 months ago, and the other is starting to show big-time.  Which leads me to my point, namely, pregnant women scare the crap out of me.  I don't know who these nutjobs are who say that pregnant women glow or that nothing is so beautiful as a woman with child, but they've obviously never worked with one.  They turn into raging hormonal freight-trains.  This woman pees about once every ten minutes.  She doesn't look like she's enjoying herself too much.  They need to take all these 13 year old girls from Jerry Springer panels who want to have a baby to keep them company through those lonely high school years and pair them up with an actual pregnant woman.  I guarantee they'll want their tubes tied in a matter of hours.   I have nothing against children, I kinda like other peoples' kids.  I don't have any of my own nor do I plan to have any, although I do enjoy the conception how-to videos and magazines.  But why does the process of actually bearing one have to be so, well,  disgusting?   I mean, we've got scientists with test tubes and vacuum hoses, can't they do something about this already?  The day that we can travel to the doctor in our flying car after eating our lunch pill so we can look at our growing vat-baby is going to be a great day in America.

      Ambivalent voters of California, Unite!  Or Don't!  We don't care!  We're the Don'tgiveacrats, the party for you!  "You" being the vast number of people who didn't vote for our governor, didn't sign the recall petition, didn't vote for the president, and didn't vote for the purple M&Ms.  Finally, there is a political party that caters to your apathy, your jadedness, your ennui.    What's our platform, you fail to ask?  Well, I'll tell you anyway:  TAXES: Eh.  EDUCATION: Sure, why not.  WELFARE REFORM: I don't know, what do you think?  ABORTION: Whatever floats your boat, man.  CAMPAIGN FINANCE: You gonna eat that?  JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS: You play that Matrix game yet?  DRUG LAWS: That game's hella tight.   Hella .  TERRORISM: That's still a bad thing, isn't it?  We haven't watched the news in awhile.  You might be wondering what kind of political action plan you can expect from a party with no candidates on any ballot anywhere (or maybe you're not).  The Don'tgiveacrats plan is simple: we urge everyone not to vote at all.  Are you tired of the old jokers in Sacramento and Washington DC getting replaced at random intervals with a new set of jokers?  That's because a very small group of you are STILL VOTING.  It's simple logic: if no one votes,  no jackasses can possibly win .  It's like nihilism, but without the German accents!    Next time you feel the need to vote, ask yourself the following questions:  Isn't there a sporting event and/or funny rerun on TV tonight?   Aren't you feeling a little hungry? If you have kids and/or pets, couldn't they use a little attention, you selfish bastard? Shouldn't you go buy that stuff to help you pass your drug test on Monday?  Remember, inaction begins at home.  Let our leaders know that silence speaks volumes.  And repeat the Don'tgiveacrat's war chant:  "What do we want?  SOMETHING!  When do we want it?  WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU!"

      ...magical pixies would sneak into teenagers' bedrooms late at night and transmute thier AFI cds into Velvet Underground albums, and their Linkin Park MP3s into Dead Kennedys' songs.  Teenagers would show their love for their new idols by either becoming smack-addicted Greenwich Village trannies or by running for mayor of San Francisco.  ...schools would receive billions in taxpayer dollars and the Air Force would have to hold a bake sale to buy bombers.  Their first bombing targets would be all those rich-ass schools.  ...Dusty Baker wouldn't be allowed anywhere near a crucial, must-win ballgame ever again.  Oh wait, he coaches for the Cubs now.  Shouldn't be an issue anymore.  ...California Democrats would respond to the threat of an Arnold Schwarzenegger gubernatorial campaign by nominating the  urlLink Vulcan chick from Enterprise .  ...The Daily Show's Lewis Black would have a hit sitcom.  It would consist of him screaming at his family and wacky neighbor for a half-hour every week.  ...people who say that "The Simpsons" isn't funny anymore would be forced to watch an episode of "The King of Queens" to see what "not funny" actually looks like.  ...Will Smith would stop making shitty movies and go back to making shitty rap songs.  ...the word "Titanic" and the phrase "Oscar Winner" would never appear together.  ...there would be a Temp Workers Appreciation Day.  It would involve oral sex and large cash bonuses.

      I'm about a third of the way through American Gods by Neil Gaiman.  This is good stuff so far.  Rachel and I devoured Good Omens in about a week total, so we'd been itching for this one.  Gaiman's just the bee's knees.  I think I like his books better than his comics, er, "graphic novels" as the author bio in the back says.  That's funny, "graphic novels" don't usually come out every month.  Sounds like Gaiman's got some issues, pun intended.    It's fun reading.  An ex-con with a penchant for coin tricks is hired by the Norse god Odin to be his muscle.  The gods of ancient immigrant cultures are real and live amongst us in the U.S., but they're mostly burnouts and losers.  Roadside tourist traps like giant twine balls and the House on the Rock are "places of power", the American equivalent of Stonehenge or the Pyramids.  That explains the hell out of the Mystery Spot.  There's a good bit in the book about how Americans are the only people who think to look for the "soul" of their country, who worry about what America is.  People in Norway and Mozambique, to paraphrase the book, don't need to go searching for the heart of Norway, or the soul of Mozambique.  "They know what they are," as Mr. Wednesday says.  I wonder what is it about America that's never quite reconciled itself with its people?  Why we have this need to understand, not just where America came from or is going (and few feel the need to know that, if you believe statistics), but to understand WHY America is?  Maybe it's because we all have the wanderlust of our immigrant ancestors, who believed that America was the land of milk and honey.  Maybe we're all just trying to find that lost corner of the country that fits the description in the tour guide.  So this book's got me feeling like a road trip.  I guess I just haven't seen enough of this country yet.

      Sorry for the delay.  Lots of Blogger issues, but it came down to something pretty simple in the end.  Blogger's tech support website is not exactly a miracle of convenience though.  I checked that sucker several times a week looking for solutions to my problem, and finally found something on Blogspot's site that helped.  So we now return you to your regularly scheduled programming.  BTW, I'm up to 2.3 on Net Riddle.  Haven't checked it out in a week; I have to go cold turkey for awhile.  I need another internet addiction like I need another nose.

      From the title, you can probably guess how I felt about tonight's MTV Video Music Awards.  For the unenlightened however, here's some post-viewing thoughts...  That Beyonce's got quite an ass on her.  I mean, really.  That's an ass you can take to the bank.  Good Charlotte is America's favorite band?   Really?   They make Blink-182 look innovative.  You gotta love the audacity of that Anthem song.  "Oooh, we're nonconformists!  We don't want to be a part of your Kelly Clarkson world!".  That's just a teensy bit over the disingenous line.  I mean, how can you be a nonconformist when your band is a ripoff of bands that were, themselves, ripoffs?  Say what you want about the Kelly Clarksons of the world.  At least she's upfront about being a tool.  If Beyonce's ass and J. Lo's ass got in a fight, who'd win?   Us.   I see that MTV now shows how hip they are by nominating videos they never actually play.  *Cough* *Cough* *Johnny Cash* *Cough*.  Not that he had a snowball's chance in hell of taking anything major.  Man, that would have been sweet though.  I guess that's why God made a Bizarro World.  Did anyone else reach for a barf bag when Metallica started playing "Smells Like Teen Spirit"?  I know I did.  Then I realized that they were just being playfully ironic, around the time they started jamming on "Seven Nation Army".  A band that's been through three bassists playing a song by a band that's never had *one*.  It's a big joke, get it?  Ho ho, that Metallica.  As James Lipton would say, "They are a delight."   Beyonce's ass should get a special award for Best Use of an Ass.  They sure hyped the shit out of Chris Rock.  He was awesome, but he was on stage for about five minutes.  That stupid sketch with Eminem and Special Ed seemed to last longer than his opening monologue.    I've been searching for an analogy to all this hoopla, and the best I can come up with is blue balls.  The VMA's are like having blue balls.  It's lots of fun to start off with, what with the teasing and the ass-slapping and the Coldplay nominations.  You're starting to get into it a little, when suddenly it all goes terribly wrong, and your left feeling disappointed and grabbing your crotch in pain.  OK, I didn't say it would be a good analogy.  I know I've already done some pissing and moaning about Johnny Cash not winning the big prize, but the real crime was what wasn't even nominated.  We all know the REAL best video of the year was "P.I.M.P." by 50 Cent.  It's all about the Pimp Legion of Doom.  Fo' shizzle.  I'm going to market a new hypnotherapy tape for people who want to quit smoking.  It's called "A 30 Minute Slow-Motion Loop of Beyonce's Ass Jiggling".    Good night everybody!  And good luck to Adam!

       Steve Masters.   For our non-Bay Area readers, Mr. Masters is the near-legendary Live 105.3 FM ex-program director and DJ who now hosts their daily Rewind hour.  He's been playing the best of the Live 105 vault for over a year now, and that alone is meritorious and deserving of accolade.  But today he pulled off his greatest stroke of genius yet when, in the midst of his old school punk-themed special program, he pulled off a triple set of "Die, Die My Darling" by the Misfits, "Clampdown" by the Clash, and X's "Breathless".  It was awe-inspiring.  I haven't heard Misfits on the radio, umm, ever.  That was perhaps the best set of three songs in a row I've ever heard on a corporate-owned station.    Truly, Steve Masters is a DJ, nay,  human  without peer.  He is the rare specimen who proves that our species is not without merit.  For these reasons and more, he is the first recipient of the Gerry Foundation Genius Grant.  He will be sent a check for $1.37 to be spent as he sees fit.  Congratulations, Steve!

      I was watching The Ring last night on DVD, and I turned to Rachel and said, "This movie would make me throw away my VCR in abject terror, if it weren't attached to the DVD player."   Then she said, in a joking manner, "It's probably supposed to make you feel that way.  The film's probably just a big plot by DVD manufacturers to get you to convert to DVD."  I laughed, but then I started thinking about it. "Ringu", which "The Ring" is a remake of, was a Japanese film.  Most of your major DVD manufacturers are Japanese corporations.  Anyone else see the connection here?  Who would stand to gain from making you afraid of VCRs?  As a point of fact there are NO DVD discs or players shown in the film.  No one's getting killed by shiny plastic plates, just bulky old obsolete tapes and VCRs that Sony would probably love to phase out in favor of more expensive DVD set-top recorders.  And what's a DVD, but a big shiny RING?!?!?  Wheels within wheels, my friends.

      Well now, how can I resist a call to arms like that.  So, to fill the void in between thoughtful posts, here's some random thoughts from Planet Max...  The big bombshell in recall news today was that Cybill Shepherd "admits" she once made out with Gray Davis in 1977.  Is this supposed to shock and offend my moral sensibilites?  Wrong state.  We don't have moral sensibilities here.  All I can say to Gray is: Nice work my friend.  Cybill was bo-day-shus.  The Last Picture Show might be a little before my time (and I haven't gotten around to watching Bogdanovich films yet), but even I slobbered over her a bit in her Moonlighting days, and I was like 8.  There's been a real dearth of great company names at work to discuss here, but I saw a good one today: Jiggyco.  I can't even read that without smiling.  Say it aloud.  "Jiggyco".  A division of Supergroovalisticprosifunkstication Enterprises LLC.  I saw Arianna Huffington on Bill Maher tonight.  I love this woman.  I love her hybrid car and her Greek accent and her jokes and her clothes and her politics and her gi-normous brain.  I want to marry her and have eco-friendly, anti-corporate, vocally-unintelligible babies with her.  I'm sure everyone (OK, both of you) wants to hear some joke about Gigli.  Well tough, 'cause I haven't seen it.  I will say this: Anyone surprised at how bad this film allegedly is  hasn't been paying attention.   May I kindly direct you to Pearl Harbor and Maid in Manhattan, please.  That's all for now kids.  Party on.

      So Arnold's in the race, and Californians couldn't be happier.  Now THIS is the spectacle we've all been waiting for.  When you put him next to Gary Coleman, Arianna Huffington (Heh heh, another immigrant.  Hey INS, naturalize this!), and various and sundry porn stars, the man looks pretty gubernatorial.  And we're all thinking about how Arnold would say "gubernatorial".  But I'm a little worried about the sudden takeover of California by the celebritocracy.  Now granted, Arnold looks like Laurence Olivier next to Ronald Reagan, and we made Reagan governor AND president.  But still, we're talking about an actor here, and if you saw Batman and Robin, you know that I use "actor" in it's loosest possible definition.  I can see the wheels turning in people's minds at the thought of the Terminator in Sacramento, but let me let you all in on something:   Arnold's a lot of things, but he is not a killer cyborg from the future.  He does not kill aliens in the jungle.  His daughter does not look like Alyssa Milano.   Get a fuggin' clue, people.  I know exactly what it is, too.  Any of you see  Last Action Hero ?  (Before you say "no", understand that I meant it as a rhetorical question.  I see crap like that so you don't have to).  There's a funny scene in that movie, in which the youthful hero has a daydream, while listening to some boring Hamlet in class, of Arnold as the melancholy Dane.  He strides through Castle Elsinore, machinegun in hand, blowing away supporting characters left and right.  "To be, or not to be?"  *KABOOM*  "Not to be."  I think this is what's going on, psychologically, in the mind of the California voter.  I think we all actually think that the next time we have a budget impasse (And we will.  Last time I checked, no one's recalling the Assembly Speaker, the REAL most influential man in Sacramento.), Arnold will throw a knife through John Burton, impaling him to a door, and say "Stick around."  I mean, intellectually, we know that he can't and/or won't , but there's still that fantasy in the back of our heads.  But then again, who knows.  Maybe he WILL drop Gray Davis into a vat of molten steel.  Stranger things have happened.  Like the time Jerry Brown was crushed in a hydraulic press.

      So we went out for karaoke tonight.  What a blast!  I had a feeling it could be detached ironic fun, but I didn't know it could be  actual   fun!    My friend Jennifer did that Evanescence song, which is (sorry to say) a profoundly shitty song.  But for what it's worth, she sounded really good singing it.  She's got a band that she's putting together (they don't have a name yet, which is a situation I feel compelled to rectify), and it should be good, judging by her karaoke voice.  I did With or Without You by U2.  Lemme tell you, I was so all over the map vocally that a GPS couldn't find the key I was in.  I started pretty shaky, so I made sure to throw in some Bono moves and falsettos to at least make it look fun.  By about the middle of the song ("And you giiiiiiiive yourself awaaay"), I realized that I ain't no Bono, and I'm only a so-so caricature, so I settled for singing loud to cover my vocal imperfections.  This is the key, I think, to faking it.  If you can't be good, be loud.  It's the Spinal Tap principle.  It didn't take long to get into it.  By the end, I had the Bono pose and everything.  I hear I was actually on key on the "hoo-ooo-ooo ooo" part at the end.  I even threw in some political talk during the solo.  Awesome night.  I WILL be hitting Pickwick's again.

      The stopgap measure worked.  The blog is now showing all posts I've written ever on the front page.  That also means my old posts have not been cropped into oblivion.  Now it's just a question of re-routing them into the right archives.  A geek's work is never done.  Just so this doesn't get entirely too dull, I just watched a good movie last night on DVD called Equilibrium.  It takes place in a future world where emotions have been banned via federally mandated daily injections.  It's about a cop called a Cleric who hunt down "sense offenders" who've gone off their dope.  Neat concept.  What you care about, though, are the  bitchin'  fight scenes.  The main character is a master of this "Gun-fu" martial art where he can kill anyone around him without moving.  And just when I thought the gun stuff would get old, the DVD reached into my brain and pulled out a sick katana fight.  Since the filmmakers target demographic was apparently  me alone,  I can see why the film didn't make much of a dent at theaters.  But check it out anyway, it scratches the violence itch.

      If you can read this, and there's no entries below this, it's because of some kind of error.  Hitting the reload page button on your browser will fix it, showing the blog in all of its multipost glory.  No idea how to fix that permanent-like.  Probably some kind of software issue, so it's unlikely little ol' goober me is going to nail it down.  I've noticed the archive links are pointing at, well, nothing.  I'm going to try and fix that, but unfortunately I have no idea whether my old posts are lost in the ether or not.  Crossing my fingers, and I'm going to try a stop-gap measure in the meantime to fix it.

      Okay, so there's been a lot of disappointing candidates for this recall crap the last week or two.  Bill Simon I can see; I guess he just couldn't get enough of the ream-job he got from Davis nine months ago, and wants a second helping.  But Dick Riordan?   He couldn't even beat Simon.   Who the hell's he kidding.  As for wacky fringe candidates, none have been too inspiring.  Doesn't sound like Schwarzenegger's going to run, ho hum.  I guess he'd rather  make shitloads of money.   What a kook.  You got Peter Camejo for the Greens, so if nothing else the Phish-head vote is locked up.  But where are the Jello Biafras, the Lyndon Larouches, the Jerry Browns?  I'd about given up on this whole political-process-as-theater-of-the-absurd until today, when I learned that none other than Larry effin' Flynt is running.  Hooray!  Finally, someone with whom we know where we stand.  What's he for?  Boobies!  And who isn't?    It's not as wacky as you'd think.  Consider: We'll never have a Clinton-esque sex scandal.  There won't be any surprises when we find out where his money's come from - it came from boobies!  He's a self-made millionaire in the classic Republican mold, and his views are liberal enough for even the Berkeley trolls.  There's no doubt that he'll stick up for our rights; the man took a bullet for the 1st Amendment!  All that, and he offers cash rewards for people who help him expose Republican shenanigans.  He got Bob Livingstone to step down from the Senate Majority Leader post when he exposed the senator's extra-marital affair.  This guy's my hero.  So I'm urging everyone I can to  Vote for Flynt! .  Hell, I'll write him in for President next year.    And remember:  Boobies!

       As you can see from the post dated 9/19, Max's World now features video for download.  I hope to be able to upload something fresh every month or so.  And this was all no small feat, mind you.  I've been trying to put video up for a couple months now.  Once again, Blogger's Knowledge Base is not a miracle of convenience.  Plus, this sort of uploading would have been a nightmare with my old dialup connection.  Just a quick peek behind the scenes here at Max's World.  So, to make posting new videos easier, I ran out today (to be honest though, it was less like "ran" and more like "rode in the car while my girlfriend drove") and bought a 128 MB Memory Stick for my camcorder.  Now I can shoot video directly onto the card, and I don't have to dick around with capturing video off a tape and compressing it to a manageable filesize.  So to sum up: $800 for the camera.  $50 for the memory card.  $30/month for DSL to upload it.  $50/year for the site to host it.  Untold dozens of dollars in man-hours working on that fishtank (Perplexed?  See the video).  I think, in the end, this cost more to make than "El Mariachi".    Upshot: At least I didn't have to sell my blood to finance it.  Maybe I'll get Salma Hayek to star in the sequel...  PS Speaking of Robert Rodriguez: the best line in his "Once Upon a Time in Mexico" which we saw last night, as delivered by the incredible Johnny Depp:  "Are you a Mexi can  or a Mexi can't ?"

      One night I dreamed I was walking along the beach with the Devil.  Many scenes from my life flashed across the sky. In each scene I noticed footprints in the sand.  Sometimes there were a set of footprints and a set of cloven hoofprints.  Other times there was just the one set of footprints.  This bothered me because I noticed that during the low periods of my life, like when I beat the drifter to death with a shovel, I could see only my own footprints.    So I said to the Devil, "You promised me, Prince of Lies, that if I followed You, You would walk with me always.  But I noticed that during the most trying periods of my life, like when I strangled that hooker, there have only been one set of my footprints in the sand.   Why, When I have needed You most, You have not been there for me?"   Lucifer replied, "My precious child, I love you and I would never leave you. During your times of trial and suffering, when you see only one set of footprints, it was then that I possessed you."."

      Simply un-friggin'-believable.  This band is scary talented.  I don't think it would be an exagerration to say that Jack White is the greatest guitarist of his generation.  There is nothing clean or neat about his playing, it simply  howls .  He throws himself around the stage like a caged animal while Meg stares him down with laser-beam eyes.  Most bands put on concerts - the White Stripes put on a  SHOW .  The opening band: I'm a Robot.  Bowie-ish glam rock meets early Cure with a singer channeling Geddy Lee.  Great sound, crappy songs.  Also, their set seemed to really drag on.  It was almost as long as the Stripes's.  Low point:  The Stripes show old Betty Boop and Little Lulu cartoons in between the warm-up act and their own set.  At first, we all liked it, but after the third or fourth Little Audrey cartoon it got a bit old.  It would have been more fun had the house music played before and after the concert not been so amazing; lots of Hank Williams and other "old-timey" country and bluegrass.  Bring on more of that.  High point:  Jack did a spoken-word rendition of Johnny Cash's "I've Got Stripes".  Just Jack, reading off of a lyric sheet, but it was so honest and heartfelt and somehow more appropriate than the Cash cover song we thought we'd hear.  Best of set:  "I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself", followed closely by "Ball and Biscuit".  "I Just Don't Know" has some truly spectacular guitar work, the equal of any of the bone-crushing solos on "Ball and Biscuit".  Run, do not walk, to see this band in your town.  I give 'em ****1/2.  I deduct half a star for having a set run under an hour.  It may be that Jack is still recovering from a broken finger, but Django Reinhardt only had three.  You make do with what God gave you, and you turn in a 90 minute set (at least).  Sorry to be stern, but that's the law 'round these parts.

      Some of my thoughts tonight, originally posted on the EN World messageboards...  (first post) I'm listening to Don't Take Your Guns to Town right now. What an amazing song. The more I think about this, the worse I feel. Three of my musical idols (Cash, Zevon, and Strummer) dead in a year's time. Those three artists were pretty much my entire musical upbringing.  I used to write a music column for my school paper. This was back in the early 90s, when bubblegum punk was just arriving as the flavor du jour. I'd get these tapes from 16 year olds who put on a Johnny Rotten sneer and thought that they were rebels. Forget about raw talent, which was usually lacking. Not one of them had the intellect, the attitude, the sheer cojones of what I remembered as the real rebels of my youth. And at the time, all three of them were walking the Earth and waiting for some kid to discover them.  And now all three are gone. Some kid will never discover these storytellers, these poets of the downtrodden and the lost. They'll know about rebellion; cash-strapped record execs and MTV's cynical programmers know that leather, tattoos and bad grammar will always sell. But I'm afraid no teenager will know what it is that they're rebelling against.  (Second post) It just kills me every time I open up my new Rolling Stone and, without fail, there's a picture of Eminem flipping the bird (Don't believe me? There's one right in the latest issue). Johnny Cash was doing that 30 years ago, back when it was cool. When Eminem does it, it just looks like a guy who lived with his mom well into his twenties who's trying way too hard to look cool.   That was the great thing about Johnny Cash - he never came off as just an act. The black clothes, the downbeat lyrics, the attitude, it all could have been so gimmicky. When he talked about wearing black to show his sympathy for the poor and working-class people that listened to him, it didn't come off as overly earnest, either. He was a genuine artist who seemed to lack any shred of artifice. There aren't too many like him left. Neil Young's one. Springsteen's another. And crap, they're getting on in years too. Ugh.  (End of posts)  Thank you Johnny.  The world's a much emptier place for your passing.

      Rachel bought a new furniture set over the weekend.  She told me the shipping company said that it would be here Sunday afternoon.  My response was, "Yeah right.  There's no way they'll be here when they say they will."  She gave me her typical dirty look she reserves for occasions when I wax cynical.  But sure enough, 4:30 PM rolls around and they call us to say that they won't have it to us until "maybe Monday."    I did my little "jig of righteousness" but I took little comfort in being right AGAIN.  This was all just very unsatisfying.  Now, I've worked with freight companies in the past, and I know better than anyone that with them, equivocation is the name of the game.  When they say "tomorrow", what they really mean is "the day after tomorrow, if the stars are right".  But lately I've been feeling this a lot.  Of course our furniture's late, and we're sitting on the carpet watching TV while our old couch is out on the lawn.  Of course our goverment doesn't work - what do these recall advocates expect?.  Of course I've been temping for a year with no sign of permanency in sight - I mean, all I've done is work hard and show up every day.  Of course those MTV Awards are going to suck.  The Era of Diminished Expectations is upon us!  Rejoice!  When did it become okay to be this cynical?  When did it stop being a defense mechanism, and instead become a legitimate world-view?  I look around, and I see a lot of messed-up people who've just thrown up their hands and said "This sucks, but what are you going to do?"

      That Tarantino, whatta guy.  Just when you're ready to write him off as a has-been after all these years without a film, he shows up with this outrageous Kill Bill jive.  This film crystallizes something I'd always suspected about QT:  he makes cool films.  I don't mean like, "I saw Scary Movie 3, y'know, it was cool."  I mean,  cool.   Cool the way the term originally meant, before it got horribly de-valued.  Cool the way Brando was cool in The Wild One.  Cool like Steve McQueen in Bullitt.  Cool that's dangerous, that the squares can't handle.    You see this level of coolness all over Tarantino's writing and directing, but especially in the way he creates indelible characters.  Reservoir Dogs's Mr. White was cool.  Jules Winfield from Pulp Fiction was cool.  Jackie Brown was supercool.  Uma Thurman's The Bride beats 'em all.  She is 50 gallons of ass-kicking in a one-liter bottle.  She is an angry, sword-swinging vengeful banshee of death.  She inhabits a world where you can carry katana swords on airplanes, and no one in the Japanese Mafia carries any weapon invented in the last 300 years.  She's been hurt bad (a gut-wrenching scene when she wakes up from her coma to discover there's no baby in her tummy anymore, and the camera stays on her hysterical crying face for what feels like an eternity to show you what 'hurt' really means), and if you're a member of Bill's Deadly Viper Assasination Squad that double-crossed her on her wedding day, then she's gonna hurt you right back.  This movie is ultraviolent - let's get that out of the way right now.  It's style is grounded in the same reality as the old Shaw Brothers chop-socky films and animes like Fist of the Northstar, which is to say, not "reality" at all.  60 gallons of blood gush out of every wound.  People jump ten feet in the air.  Mobs with weapons will surround the Bride, then attack one at a time until they're all dead.  You will laugh harder at the limb-hackings and beheadings in this film than at any joke in any Adam Sandler movie.    Performances - what's not to like?  Uma, Lucy Liu, Darryl Hannah in another of Quentin Tarantino's patented Career Resurrection roles, and the extremely scary Disembodied Voice of David Carradine.  And SONNY FREAKIN' CHIBA!  Direction - Beautiful.  Every shot's ripped off of another movie, completely unapologetically.  From the overhead-looking down tracking shots of Brian DePalma to the rapid zoom-in facial close-up from every kung-fu film EVER.  It's all there and all awesome.  Script - There is none.  To paraphrase Joe Bob Briggs, who needs a bunch of plot getting in the way of the story?  Seriously, if you come to this looking for comedic banter a la Jules and Vincent, fuggedaboutit.  There's no time for banter, just time for vengeance.  Music - By The Rza.  Great pastiche of Kung Fu movie incidental music, Sergio Leone spaghetti western scores and hip hop.  Rating - 4 Stars out of 4.  Go park your ass in front of a screen for a few shows.  When your ass goes numb from sitting too long, command your big toe to wiggle.

      The Yankees just won.  And there was much rejoicing and spraying of Cristal.  They go on to face the Florida Marlins in the World Series (this recap for my readers who habitually avoid the sports page, bar chatter, or the last five minutes of the local news, which is to say,  all of my readers ).  In the last few weeks, everyone was talking up the possibility of a Cubs/Red Sox title match.  And Fate, in its infinite and cruel jest, almost let it happen.  But there was another force at work in the last few nights, an imperceptible hand guiding the destinies of four teams.  Call it God, karma, thermodynamics, or the Galactic Overlord Xenu himself, but forces were arrayed to keep the unthinkable from happening.  For you see, a Cubs/Red Sox World Series threatened to unravel the delicate threadwork of society, if not the very fundament of the space-time continuum.  For you see, Major League Baseball dictates that one team must win (unless it's deep into extra innings during the All Star Game and the commissioner needs his beauty rest).  But here we are faced with a conundrum.  Both the Red Sox and the Cubs  can't mutually lose .  This would necessitate a universe in which either the Red Sox or the Cubs could somehow win a World Series.  Needless to say, this universe is not our own, but some dire fubar'ed cosmos in which you can probably kill your own grandfather before you were born.  Don't believe me?  Here's a complete breakdown of this fantasy World Series (note: do not read on unless you have a doctorate-level understanding of astrophysics and apocalyptic theology, or are already insane):  Game One: 1-1 tie is broken in the 17th inning when a house cat, driven wild by a sudden ultrasonic noise heard by animals around the world, streaks onto the field and claws out Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra's eyes, allowing a blooper up the middle to score.  Cubs win.  Game Two: 109-4.  Massive onslaught of Boston runs in the 8th as gravity reverses itself for 15 minutes.  Sox win.  Also, Don Zimmer becomes Earth's second natural satellite, occupying a permanent orbit at L-5.  Game Three: The Dread Cthulhu, having risen from his sunken tomb of R'lyeh, throws out the first pitch.  Most of both teams' starting lineups are instantly driven mad from fright.  Dusty Baker offers to mate with the Deep Ones as a sacrifice to the Great Old One.  Cubs win 2-1.  Game Four: After a rain delay which lasts forty days and nights, a faction of suicide bombers led by a coalition of Al-Qaeda operatives, the IRA, Sri Lankan separatists and radical anti-Papists wipe out the entire Chicago bullpen during the 7th Inning Stretch.  Sox win 5-4 in 13 innings.  California falls into Pacific Ocean for some reason.  Game Five: Cubs win 9-7.  Not a bad game actually, only no television viewers see it due to unprecedented electromagnetic anomalies in the upper atmosphere interfering with global satellite transmission.  Aurora Borealis seen as far south as Honolulu.  Game Six: Conventional mathematics fail as Red Sox somehow score runs equal to the square root of -1.  Unable to determine whether the result is positive or negative, it is still deemed higher than the Cubs's score of 8 divided by 0.    Game Seven: Both teams perish as the Earth opens beneath them and swallows them whole.  Archangels with flaming swords declare the series null and void.  California somehow falls into Pacific Ocean again.

      Let's make some controversy.  Feel free to spread any of these rumors (completely fabricated by myself) in email attachments, drop them into conversations, or write exhaustive, obsessive-compulsive treatises on them.  -Taoists live in the New York sewers.  -The world is secretly run by a shadowy consortium consisting of Steve Jobs, the Gnomes of Zurich, Tony the Tiger, Hideki Tojo (not dead after all), and the members of Kraftwerk.  -You can bounce chihuahuas like a rubber ball,  but only twice .  -A woman once inquired as to the "secret recipe" for the delicious cookie she ate at a fancy restaurant.  They happily furnished it to her free of charge, and she took the recipe's ingredients to her grave.  -If you listen to Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven" backwards, Robert Plant says "You dig hot man-love, kemosabe."  -Gravity is a scam cooked up by the Ford Motor Company.  -Dungeons & Dragons can make your average morbidly-depressed and drug-addicted teenager commit suicide.  Alert your pastor!  -Elvis didn't die in 1977.  He died in  1967 .  From the 1968 Comeback Special onward, "Elvis" , or "False E" as he was known to the Memphis Mafia, was portrayed by a cleverly-disguised JFK.

We co-wrote, I starred, he directed and lensed, and he's editing it as I type this.  If we can get the filesize down to a manageable level I hope to have this film up on the site as soon as it's done.  Regardless, words of praise go to Jake for his flawless direction.    I need to make more of these.  I got to hack up an oleander bush with a katana.

      Thougts and feelings on Matrix Revolutions, with various and sundry spoilers:  First half: Ho hum.  Weren't the squiddies 20 hours away like, 10 hours ago?  I'd have to go back to the Reloaded DVD, but weren't they 6 hours away at the end?  Anyway, lotsa yakking, although thankfully a little more cogent than Reloaded's yakking.  Great BDSM club scene though.  Second half: Oh my Christ.   GIANT FREAKIN' ROBOT BATTLES!   If the rest of this movie had been gay cowboys eating pudding, the  GIANT FREAKIN' ROBOT BATTLES  would have made it all worthwhile.    SuperSmith vs. Flying Neo in the rainstorm was very nicely done.  Saw some shots that looked videogame fake, but less so than Reloaded's burly brawl.  As cool as it was though, it was basically a big slugfest.  Not even a very kung fu-ish one at that.  I was really looking forward to seeing what two gods could do to each other in a reality as malleable as the Matrix.  Compare it to the final battle in Dark City, with Murdoch and Mr. Book basically throwing buildings at each other, stopping each others missiles in mid-air, and redirecting them at each other.  Still, as slugfests go, Revolutions was suitably epic.  The Ending:  Having a hard time on this.  It was good, but it wasn't what I wanted.  It left me feeling a little cold.  The best thing I can say about it is I can't think of a better way to end it, but that's the Wachowski brothers' jobs, not mine.  Don't let my negativity fool you, I genuinely liked this movie.  I think it's a testament to what the Wachowskis created that everyone is so contentious about it; everyone feels that it's  their own  film.  It's similar to the criticisms leveled at the Star Wars reissues and prequels:  "Lucas is fucking with MY MOVIES!"  I'd say any comparison to a pop culture phenomenon like Star Wars (to which the Matrix Trilogy more than holds its own) has to be considered a positive.    Will this be looked at the way Star Wars is 30 years from now?  Hard to say.  After all, the Matrix generation still has Star Wars front and center in their experiences, but people in 1977 had bupkis.  That's why SW is so huge in peoples' minds.  Is it as good as Star Wars?  Except for a much less satisfying ending than Jedi's, I'd say yes.  And that's as high praise as you'll ever get out of me.  Plus, it had  GIANT FREAKIN' ROBOT BATTLES!   Revolutions:  **1/2 stars our of four.  The whole 7-some-odd hour Matrix Trilogy:  ****.

      It's a cover of the Animals' "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" by 70's disco footnote Santa Esmeralda, as featured in the Kill Bill soundtrack.  To those who've seen the film (ye kool kats) it's the song that plays while the Bride and O-Ren Ishii fight at the end.  Ten-and-a-half minutes of flamenco-disco-funk.  It's the ginchiest.

       Best Film I Saw in 2003:    Da Return of Da King .  Oh god, just thinking about it makes me wanna see it again.  Peter Jackson is a pimp.  Samwise is King Pimp.  Shelob is a spiderpimp.  The Wachowskis should be strapped down in some sort of Clockwork Orange torture room and forced to watch this until they can only gibber "We won't fuck up a third act ever again".   Best Album I Didn't Steal in 2003:    Elephant , by the  White Stripes .  This band makes you wish you were some sort of Detroit-area indiepop hipster so you could honestly say You Heard Them First.  This album made my skaterpunk 13-year-old brother want to learn to play Delta blues and ask me questions about Robert Johnson.  Meg and Jack should get some kind of newly-invented Nobel Prize for that alone.   Best Live Act of 2003:   Tough category, seeing as how I actually went to more than one show this year.  They were all consistently excellent.  I'd favor The White Stripes, but unfortunately A) They had a shitty opening act that I was forced to sit through due to the lack of reserved seats, and B) We had to sit for like 87 years in between acts watching old cartoons that got progressively more irritating.  The Stripes had to put on an amazing show to make up for it, and they did.  But I keep coming back to the  Zwan  show at the Warfield in May.  Hearing something like the 14 minute epic "Jesus I/Mary Star of the Sea" performed  in reverse order  with bleeding-fingertip solos by the rejuventated Billy Corgan and getting to witness the thundering genius of Jimmy Chamberlain was made even more thrilling to me since I now realize in retrospect that I'll never get to see them again.  A damned shame.   Best Interweb Time-Waster that I only recently discovered in 2003:   I'd say this   urlLink Blogger   business, but I mustn't bite the hand that feeds me.  So I'm going to go with   urlLink Internet Wayback Machine  .  Nothing like perusing those lost websites of yore.  Like this one  urlLink here .   Best TV Show of 2003:   This is the year  Six Feet Under  finally supplanted  Sopranos  for me.  Sopranos was merely amazing, but SFU was transcendant.  All I have to say is: What did poor Lisa ever do to anybody?  You thought I was going to say  Rich Girls , huh?  Just wait, the second season will be my pick for 2004, when I understand...

      I've seen it twice already.  Oh dear Buddha, this thing is amazing.  There's about a million fucking orcs, 50 foot tall war elephants with LAWNMOWERS (no shit) between their tusks, the best flaming-body-jumping-off-a-cliff suicide EVER, a big honkin' volcano, D-Day with swords and horses, an army of ghost mercenaries, leggy blondes, catapults firing severed heads, hot beacon-lighting action (Seriously.  People were cheering at  beacon fires being lit .  Does Peter Jackson know how to work a crowd or what?), an orc general that looks like Sloth from The Goonies, a hobbit that looks like Mikey from The Goonies, the most pants-shittingly humongous spider ever made, Mordor gets nuked, all the hobbits end up naked and lying in a pile.  Okay, I fibbed a little on that last one, BUT NOT BY MUCH.  I don't even know how to rate this thing.  I went for that whole 4-star scale before, but this one breaks it completely.  I give it, like, 8 stars.  You may not even need to watch any movies ever after this.  Well, except the Extended Edition next year, if you are so inclined.

      Sure, the Dell Guy and Jared from Subway are bullet-riddled fish in the proverbial barrel; that doesn't mean they don't NEED to be capped on.  Go buy Triumph's new CD+DVD "Come Poop With Me".  "I Keed" and "Together in Pooping" are the best laughs I've had since hearing Arnold float a tax hike.

      Found this nice little  urlLink inflation calculator  today.  Among other things, I found that the $9.50 movie ticket I bought last night would have cost me $3.13 in 1977, the year I was sent to this planet.  But over on  urlLink this site  it says that the average ticket price in 1977 was $2.23.  So what this all means is ... I don't know.  Ticket prices are rising faster than the rate of inflation?  Ugh, math hard.    Until I hear otherwise, I'll just assume I'm being hideously gouged at the box office and everywhere else for that matter.  Except for Lord of the Rings.  Hot damn, I'd pay $20 to go see that.  Can you believe somebody spent $9.50 to see 2 Fast 2 Furious?   You know what really bugs me?   (Is immediately sent cease-and-desist order from Andy Rooney, even before this post is published)  Oh, nevermind.

      As inspired by  urlLink this  discussion on Fark.com, may I present the Fellowship of the Underpants!  Aragorn: You have my sword... Legolas: ...and you have my bow... Gimli: ...and my underpants. ---- Galadriel: Even the smallest underpants can change the course of the future. ---- Gandalf: It reads: The underpants of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak friend and enter. Merry:  What d'you suppose that means?  Gandalf: Oh, it's quite simple. If you are a friend, you speak the password, and the underpants will open. ---- Gandalf: Underpants? It was underpants that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill before this is over. The underpants of Bilbo may rule the fate of many. ---- Gandalf: There is only one Lord of the Ring, only one who can bend it to his will. And he does not share underpants. ---- Boromir: And what would a Ranger know of this matter? Legolas:  This is no mere ranger! He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. You owe him your underpants.  ---- Butterbur: Gandalf...Gandalf...Oh yea I remember elderly chap, big gray underpants, pointed hat. Not seen him for six months.  ---- Gimli: I will be dead before I see the Ring in the underpants of an elf! ---- Gandalf: All we have to decide is what to do with the underpants that is given to us.

       Everything I Needed to Know I Learned From Watching Kill Bill  is finished.  Jake and I had a blast making it, and I hope your viewing of it is similarly blast-worthy.  I envision it playing at some college campus midnight movies some day, with over-enthusiastic coeds standing in line dressed in off-white tees and blue shorts, waving around plastic swords and screaming warcries, whilst some poor "Watching Kill Bill-virgin" has to dress as the oleander bush.  Incidentally, I'd like to thank Rachel for letting me hack up her bushes, the good folks at Grace Bakery for the delicious bread, my neighbors for not calling the cops, and Jake for all the hard work editing it (believe it or not, we spent hours filming this).    But enough of my yakking.  Click  urlLink here  to view it, or right click to save it to disk.  BEWARE: This sucker's big, like 28 megabytes or so.  Don't do it unless you've got a connection worthy of the SHEER POWER.

      Does Jon Stewart read Max's World?  And if so, is he cherry-picking the best jokes from here to toss into his show?  The evidence, it would appear, is overwhelming.  To wit: while interviewing Curb Your Enthusiasm's Jeff Garlin on The Daily Show this evening, Jon made a joke about a what-if Cubs-Red Sox World Series that sounded suspiciously like my blog entry from  urlLink October 16th, 2003 .  At first, I laughed it off as the sort of humorous (if obvious) observation anyone would make about the 2003 playoffs.  But once the laughter had died down I got curious, and I started digging.  What I found was a disturbing pattern of plagiarism and creative bankruptcy that Mr. Stewart has turned into a career.  See for yourself:   Jon Stewart  is the host of Comedy Central's The Daily Show, a spoof of television news shows.  Remind anyone of HBO's groundbreaking 80's series Not Necessarily the News?   Jon Stewart  had a cameo role as "Enhancement Smoker" in the 1998 stoner comedy "Half Baked", whose story is an obviously uncredited rewrite of "How Green was My Valley".   Jon Stewart  was in "Big Daddy", which was a rip-off of "Sophie's Choice".   Jon Stewart's  nebbishy, short Jewish intellectual shtick was done to much better effect by, you guessed it, comedian/actor Richard Pryor.  And the list goes on and on.  Jon, I'm not asking you to repudiate your entire career.  Who can forget your work on MTV's "You Wrote It, You Watch It", or your star turn as a man with a bad haircut in "Death to Smoochy"?  I only ask for the credit due to me as an artist.  And for a small fee I'll even keep quiet about "Playing by Heart".  You know what I mean.

      I'm adding a link to my brother's online diary entitled "Hours of Fun & Challenge".  He goes to San Diego State, which I'm told is beautiful when it's not engulfed in flames.  Adam is what's known as a "red-shirt" freshman there, which I assume has something to do with Star Trek ensigns.  He is pretty expendable, from a strictly tactical standpoint.  Of late, I've been on something of an odyssey trying to nab a copy of  Sorenson Squeeze .  It's a video compression tool that shrinks great big video files like my Kill Bill movie down to itty-bitty cute wittle file-lets.  Unfortunately, the full version runs a nice $450 (Cheap!) and I constantly find myself missing Benjamins that a hard-working American artist such as myself surely deserves.  And so I chose the path less travelled: the outlaw trail.  My first foray was onto the messageboards.  I was kindly directed (and by "kindly" I mean I was told "Learn to use Google, you dumbest of fucks.") to any number of warez sites.  For those of you not "hip" to my "internet" "scene", a warez site is a download website that strives to ensure that multimedia-authoring software developers, the folks at Rockstar Games, internet pornographers and the filmmakers who brought you "Eight Heads in a Duffel Bag" never make a goddamn cent again.  Which, in the latter case at least, isn't such a bad idea.  But as anyone who's been to extralegal sites before can attest, what I got for my troubles was several useless keygens and an open invitation to a virus party on my hard drive.  So I turned to slightly less illegal venues, namely my uncle and his vast collection of legally purchased multimedia software.  Turned out he had a copy and everything!  He burned it onto CD and sent it directly to my home!  When I saw that package in my mailbox, you'd have thought Christmas had come twice.  Then I slap that thing in my Sony and was hit with the awful surprise.  As it turns out, my uncle owns something called an  Apple Macintosh , which I imagine he picked up in his Edsel on his way to a drive-in movie theater.  So I'm back to square one and considering getting a PayPal account.  I can't imagine anyone would donate money, but their reassuring embedded icon reminds me that nothing in life is free, except wisdom.  And pop-up ads.  And viruses.

       An open letter to Mel Gibson   I went out and saw your new film The Passion of the Christ this afternoon.  Entertaining?  Hoo boy, was it ever!  Was it as much fun to make as it was to watch?  Now, it was a tad violent, but then again my favorite scene in Braveheart was the torture/execution at the end, and this movie was like 2 hours of that!  Hooray!  However I did have a couple of problems with this film.  First of all, this Jesus guy is just a little too unbelievable as a character.  First off, this sucker is  cut.   Rock hard abs, bulging biceps; you can tell he's not just doing carpentry for the free tables.  But when the temple guards come for him in the olive grove, how come he doesn't throw down?  Now Peter, that guy was hardcore.  Lay a hand on his buddy Jesus and off goes your ear!  And what does JC do?  Right when it's getting interesting, he tells Peter to put down his sword.  WTF?!?!?  That  could  have been one righteous fight scene.  It even looked like Jesus had powers like Neo from the Matrix!  You dropped the ball big time Mel.  Which leads me to the next problem: Jesus is just too nice.  He's always all "Turn the other cheek"-this and "Love your enemy as you would thy neighbor"-that.  I don't care what my dad tells me, no way I'm praying for the guys who are crucifying me.  Also, it appears as if he's in love with his mom, or possibly those dirty hippie guys who follow him around.  Yuck-o.  They even had that fine-ass Persephone chick from the Matrix as the Potential Love Interest, but nothing happens.  Meanwhile, he's telling dudes to eat his flesh and drink him and stuff.  Did you establish in the movie that this Jesus guy was gay, or maybe one of those fruity Anne Rice vampires (y'know, to explain the powers)?  I mean, either way is cool, I was just wondering if I missed it.  Last but not least is what I call the Big Daddy Factor.  All throughout the movie you keep playing up what a collossal badass Jesus's dad is.  So when you actually  (SPOILER)  kill Jesus at the end, I was expecting his Dad to show up with his ball-stomping boots laced up.  So what happens, what's the big action-packed climax?  There's a little storm and a mild earthquake fucks up the Temple.  AND THAT'S IT.  C'mon dude, I live in California, we eat storms and earthquakes for breakfast and then ask for a bowl of killer bees.  This "God" guy's a lightweight.  I thought we were gonna see some 10' tall hoary thunderer kicking Roman rectae and taking down nominae.  Talk about a let-down.  All throughout the movie, I kept feeling like I was really watching the first act of a bigger movie.  And sure enough, there's a big fat Hint of Impending Sequel at the end of the movie which I will not give away here.  Did you pull a Kill Bill?  Should we expect a Passion of the Christ Volume II about six months from now?  Because, honestly, there's a lot of unresolved issues at the end of the movie.  For one thing, those fuckers Pilate and Caiphas have  got to go .  I was thinking it would be tight to see Jesus chase them around with one of those scourges, and then Peter can get one of those big-ass Braveheart prop swords that you probably have lying around your house and just kneecap those torturer guys with it.    Then he and Dad high-five, Jesus scores with that Magdalene chick, and fade to credits.

      I've played around with my Blogger template, and the results are what you see here.  Anyone like it?  It's got a whole teal-on-orange thing going, which Rachel assured me looks good.  Me, I've got the eye for color coordination of a man who's been blind from birth, so I need a second opinion on these kinds of things.    I may or may not change the sidebar text from black to something less Halloweeny, but all in all we approve.  I especially like how separate posts are clearly demarcated from each other by the orange dateline, and the sidebar stands out from the main page.    Is it too much orange?  Will old readers stop by and think I sold the page to someone else?  Has Max's World jumped the shark?  Will there be Max's World grognards who insist that the page worked much better when it was old-school black-on-white with light teal?

      While watching Conan last night with Rachel, we happened across a commercial for Sunsetter Retractable Awnings.  Now, there's a comfortable pattern to commercials like these; they usually begin with some sort of pre-purchase testimonial by a customer about why their life was unliveable until they bought the product.  Usually it's in black-and-white, featuring Customer Woman getting very frustrated over some trivial activity.  In this particular ad, a woman was discussing at length the problems she had with her old patio table's umbrella while trying to entertain their good friends, the "Mackenzies".  Then, the camera pans over the table to show the "Mackenzies", who just so happen to be  very Asian.   Now, far be it from me to generalize.  I'm sure in the entire world you can probably find enough Asian MacSomethings to fill your average-sized VFW hall, even if you choose not to include people who got the name from marrying the caucasian Mr. MacSomething.  But don't you think, just maybe, this is a little quirkier than a commercial for retractable awnings needs to be?    It led me down a whole path of thought.  How did this happen?  Was the script written with "Mackenzies" and the only actors who really nailed the role of a couple with sun in their eyes Asian?  Did the director want to change the names, but there was a frustrated ad copy writer who refused to compromise his vision?  Did the family Americanize their name when they came to this country (as my family did)?  Are they advance operatives from Beijing, sent to acquire the secrets of our patio furniture technology?  Is there some part of Scotland filled with Asians?  Why weren't they in Braveheart?    Please help me.  My world no longer makes sense.

      I've got some really brilliant excuses for why I haven't been blogging lately.  Really, they're airtight, and once you've heard them you'll feel bad for ever doubting me.   1. Legend of the Green Dragon.   I found out they have the old Legend of the Red Dragon BBS door game available to play on the web now.  Well, I was addicted to it 10 years ago and I've found that some habits die hard.  You can find me over on Maddnet as TheRedDon.  Don't even try taking me out in the Inn though; I have more hit points than you could possibly imagine.   2. My new television.   Rachel finally caved.  We are now the proud owners of a 51" Sony HD monitor.  Rachel says I gaze on it with a look that's not entirely wholesome.  I don't care.  We got it in time for kickoff on Super Bowl Sunday.  You should see how big Janet Jackson's tit looked on this thing.  Almost as big as the boob next to her.   3. Upright Citizens Brigade DVD.   If you didn't catch this show on Comedy Central 5 or 6 years ago, check out the DVD.  It was one of the smartest and funniest sketch comedy shows I've ever seen, with the kind of dovetailing metaplots and running gags Monty Python used to do so well.  Worth it alone just for the Little Donnie episode.

      I've been thinking a lot about pimps lately.  Well, truthfully, I've been thinking about pimping itself.  The artform, if you will.  I've found myself in something of a rut professionally in the last few years.  I'm told that these are the years when you decide what you want to do with the rest of your life.  And honestly, maybe this is the MTV talking, but I think I want to be a pimp.  There's a few obstacles however.  First off, I'm not big on the degradation of women.  I can't say the word "bitch" with a straight face.  I've got nothing against prostitution but I'm not sure I want to be the guy profiting from it.  I suppose I can get over that if it's a prerequisite for the job, but no pimp-slapping.  As Sir Mix-a-lot once rapped, I treat my women like Flo-Jo.  Second, hardcore drugs seem to be a big part of the pimp/ho business dynamic.  Now, I'm no angel, but I don't want to push crack.  As my grandfather used to say, "A crack salesman used to mean you were just a really good salesman."  So no drugs.  Also, I lack a name conducive to pimping.  Max Gerry does your taxes.  Max Gerry will format a spreadsheet.  Max Gerry will paint any car for $99.95.  But you don't go to a guy named Max Gerry for his stable of hos.  This at least, I can do something about.  Let's start with the archetypical pimp, American Pimp star and Snoop Dogg hanger-on Bishop Don Magic Juan.  That's a lot of titles he's got on him, starting with the religious one.  I can't be Bishop, since he is, so I'm going to go with Cardinal.  Now I need a title of respect, such as Don.  I'm going to go with the original pimp, the Marquis de Sade, and use Marquis de Something.  Now I need some kind of general innuendo.  That "Magic Juan" works nicely for him.  I need something that's both playful and gives the notion that I'm packing a trouser snake of mythological proportions.  So henceforth, my pimp name is:   Cardinal Marquis de Swizzle Stick .  Or, as Snoop shall know me,  Swizzle Stizzle .

      The Passion.  Janet Jackson's nipple.  Clear Channel.  Gay marriage.  The FCC.  The Vatican refusing to step up against child molestation.  George W. "I take orders directly from God" Bush.  It's all coming together.  The forces arrayed are devastating.  They're so close to achieving their goal of making America the most boring, white bread, God-fearing (make no mistake, they're talking about their own extremely limited notion of Jesus Christ here, not whatever your philosophy is likely to be) place in the known universe that I can already feel the urge to throw on a sweater vest, put on a little Pat Boone and get down to some strictly-procreative sex with my church-issued heterosexual lifemate.  Now, I try to be sensible.  I tell myself that people are just going to believe in whatever they want to believe, no matter how silly, illogical, medieval or morally twisted it happens to be.  If you shudder everytime someone mentions Queer Eye, go ahead.  If you want to throw out your TV, radio, newspaper and computer just in case something that offends your narrow view of the world comes across it, be my guest.  Fuck, if you want to erect an altar to Baal in your garage and wear chicken intestines on your head then more power to you.    JUST LEAVE ME THE FUCK OUT OF IT.  I am not some slack-jawed yokel who needs a Sky Bully (thanks Joss Whedon) to tell me right from wrong and dangle some imaginary afterlife carrot-and-stick in front of me.  I'm not populating the earth with my spawn and demanding that YOU stop drinking/swearing/smoking/screwing because MY kids might see something that I refuse to explain to them.    And yeah, I've got more important things to do than obsess over a split second shot of tit or what Howard Stern's saying on the radio.  Important things such as drinking, swearing, smoking and screwing - try them sometime.    I refuse to get my panties in a twist over what a few gay people want to do.  Quit pretending like it's got something to do with the "sanctity of marriage".  You just don't like that they're fucking each other in the ass.  You know what?  Get used to it.  I don't like fucking in the ass or being fucked in the ass, but I'm willing to concede someone else might.  Besides, depending on which poll you like, somewhere between 5-10% of us are gay.  That means you probably know or are related to at least one gay person.  Let that freak you out for a while before you realize "Hey, no one's ever tried to fuck me in the ass without my express written consent, and knowing that cousin Karl is a queer hasn't altered my life one iota, except that I can't talk about my drapes with him without commiting myself to a couple of hours."  I want to hear four-letter words on every show.  I want to hear Oscar the Grouch tell Elmo to go fuck himself.  "Today's Sesame Street was brought to you by the letters F and S and the number 69, beeyotch!"  Kids gotta learn somewhere.  I want my goddamn stem cell medicines NOW.  They made this stuff out to sound like it would cure cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's and halitosis.  Would it have?  Who knows?  Maybe the South Koreans who are going to have this stuff 10 years before us will know.  We let a bunch of Bible-thumpers who didn't even understand the scientific process involved dictate this policy to us.  Make no mistake about it,  someone you love will die before their time because of this.    Memo to lawmakers: Next time you feel a Jesus attack coming on, here's what you do:  1. Put down your pen. 2. Get up from your desk. 3. BACK SLOWLY AWAY FROM THE LEGISLATION.  Do all of the above or I swear on my life I will start a campaign to elect Louis Farrakhan as president, and you'll all see what happens when you let someone with a completely different belief system call the shots for you.  Oh, and FREE JAMES BROWN.  Peace out.

      You may run into me in line at some of the following this summer:   Troy   Hey, I'm a sucker for Greeks.  My girlfriend's Greek (sorta).  Democracy is Greek.  Hot boy love is Greek.  It's all good.  Brad Pitt's good at asskicking roles and Achilles is like the First Asskicker.  And it's got both Brian Cox and Peter O'Toole.  I never miss a film that features both Cox  and  O'Toole.  Yeah, I'm just gonna stop that now.   Shrek 2   The first one aged well.  I'm down.   The Day After Tomorrow   No one flattens New York like Roland Emmerich (ID4, Godzilla).  Seriously, the guy's boffo for it.  If he destroys New York seven more times he gets a free T-Shirt.   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban   My favorite of the books so far, and who doesn't love Gary Oldman?  Plus it's got Emma Thompson.  And all the kids are all pimply and gawky-looking now.   Spiderman 2   But of course.  I'm all about Doc Ock.  His arms better be adamantium though.  I will throw a little kid hissy fit if they aren't.  Seriously, don't fuck with my comic book adapatations you Punisher-raping bastards.   Before Sunset   The first one, Before Sunrise, is the geek date movie rental of choice.  Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke walking around Vienna for hours.  It was My Dinner With Andre if Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory got up and walked around instead of sitting there, stuffing their faces like the lazy bastards they are.    Seriously though, that was all IMDB'd.  I've never seen My Dinner With Andre in my life.  For all I know, they whip out .45's at the end and it turns into the teahouse scene from Hard Boiled.  Before Sunrise was purty to look at though, and Julie Delpy,  fuggedaboutit.    Anchorman   Starring Will Ferrell, who's funnier than everyone left on SNL now put together.   The Bourne Supremacy   I'm going to go ahead and get pre-emptively defensive about this:  Hey, fuck you, I liked Bourne Identity.     Hero   Holy crap in a bucket full of crap that is, itself, made out of solidified crap.  This movie looks sooooo sweet I got diabetes just watching the trailer.  It's got Jet Li and Tony Leung and Zhang Ziyi and flying people and swords and the implied promise of people being hacked with those swords.

      After getting complaints about the quicktime video not playing, I've taken it down in favor of a Windows Media version.  Yes, Windows sucks, fight the power, etc., but this one is significantly smaller in size (16 megs instead of 28, still trying to get Sorenson) and has the advantage of actually working right.  I think I've changed all the links to point at the new file, but if someone catches a bad one let me know.

      I decided to while away the hours at work today by listening to the most appropriate banking music I could think of: Gangsta Rap (who talks about cash more than those guys?).  The classic track "Cusswords" by Oaktown player Too Short came over the headphones (featuring the Shakespearean couplet "Cusswords, just let 'em roll/Motherfucking shit, goddamn asshole") and I couldn't help but be profoundly moved by his hatred for sucka MC's.  I know exactly how Todd feels.  People are constantly calling me weak, even after I've pointed out that their daddy snorts coke and their mother's a freak.  So surely the Sucka MC phenomenen can't be solely limited to the hip-hop game.  I've decided to call on the proverbial carpet the following Sucka MC's:   Tucker Carlson can suck a big fat diiiick.   Tucker Carlson, bow-tied douchebag co-host of CNN's Crossfire, is perhaps the only person on the planet who can make that asshat Robert Novak look classy.  Pretty much any pundit you care to name is going to be a wack bitch by definition, but there are no pundit bitches wacker than Carlson.  And he's always all up in James Carville's business.  Let a player play, you jiveass turkey.   The WB network programmers can suck a big fat diiiick.   You bitches cancelled Angel.  If any of you suckas show your faces in my 'hood I will go fourth-season-Wesley on your asses.   Michael Eisner can suck a big fat diiiick.   You player-hatin', documentary-rejecting, Jeb Bush-blowing motherfucker.  Keep your limpdick mouse-ear-wearing ass out of my entertainment, bitch.   Mountain bikers who take up the whole lane on a swervy two lane road can suck a big fat diiiick.   I am not going to prison because you made me run over your stupid sorry ass. I am not asking you spandex-wearing bitches to dive off a cliff when I roll up in my Saturn, but if I gotta choose between ending your candyass and totalling my ride, guess which one of us is going down?  Check yoself before  I  wreck yoself.   People who say "roll-playing" can suck a big fat diiiick.   Keep your gay-ass LARPing opinion to yourself.  I will personally cap the next motherfucker who wants to talk about the G/S/M theory.  Don't push your weakass diceless shit on me.

      Just returned from a weekend trip up the coast to Fort Bragg/Mendocino.  Let me interrupt my usual cynicism here for just a moment: It's so beautiful up there.  It's literally like "Hey look, yet another awe-inspiring vista."  How do the locals get used to it?  I'm from that area originally and have vacationed there a lot over the years, so I got the treat of showing Mendo-newbie Rachel around.  We stayed in the  urlLink Lodge at Noyo River  in a suite that must have been half the size of our house.  At night we drove down to Mendocino and walked around town and took in the sunset from the Headlands park, then we walked up to  urlLink Cafe Beaujolais  for dinner.  Fan-frickin-tastic.  Niman Ranch beef is the only thing that should be allowed to call itself "beef".  Everything else is a pale imitator.  In the morning we went back to Mendocino and hiked around the beach.  We drove back into town and Rachel had the run of the galleries while I hung back and people-watched.  There's plenty of bums wandering around Mendocino so a Bay Area boy like myself felt quite at home.  I guess, if you have to be homeless, you could do a lot worse than Mendocino.  We had to run back not long after that.  I'm of the opinion that the best time to go back home is when you're still ready to stay longer, so you don't weary of the place.    Well, enough sweetness.  I'm ready to take the piss outta something now.  I've got a lot of free time this week to get cynical.  I'll be back to form in no time.

      Thanks to  urlLink The Gematriculator  I can now pinpoint with laser-like accuracy exactly how evil this website is.   urlLink     Knowing that The Gematriculator uses an unimpeachably scientific process ( "Experts consider the mathematical patterns in the text of the Holy Bible as God's watermark of authenticity. Thus, the Gematriculator provides only results that are absolutely correct." ) I decided to find out just how much evil I'm being exposed to in a random day of browsing.  Here's some of my findings.   urlLink Yahoo  = 67% Evil  urlLink Wal-Mart  = 48% Evil  urlLink Microsoft  = 38% Evil  urlLink Church of Latter Day Saints  = 24% Evil  urlLink The American Nazi Party  =23% Evil  So there you go.   Max's World - More Evil Than Nazis!

      While looking quite busy today at work (note: Actually, I was composing a musical version of "Plan 9 From Outer Space" in my head to be titled "O! Plan 9!") a "tech-support guy" wandered out of the blue to my neighbor's cubicle and announced he was taking her printer to another department.  And an amazing thing happened: she gave it up without seeing ONE FORM OF IDENTIFICATION.  Apparently, the standard IT uniform of Polo shirt, dockers and sensible shoes is enough to convince anyone.  So wanna hear my big plan for big money?  1. Go buy the above clothing and a multitool you can keep conspicuous in a trouser pocket.  The Swiss Army Knife is to IT guys what the Puffy White Mushroom-Cloud Hat is to French chefs.  Also, you can use it to fight off security goons if the plan goes awry.  2. March right through the doors of a mid-size office building.  If security hassles you, wave something laminated in their face and tell them the Java server's down.  They'll laugh and make a joke about bad coffee.  Roll your eyes and continue down the hall.  3. Pick a cubicle at random.  Tell them you're here to fix their printer.  Don't worry: it'll be broken.  They're always broken.  If by some chance it isn't, give it a dirty look.  That ought to kill it.  4. Throw around any of the following terms at workers to establish your IT cred and deflect suspicion: "Trouble ticket". "PC Load Letter Error". "Toner cartridge". "Java server".  5. Tell them you'll have to bring it in to the IT Dept. office to service it.  Don't take any guff from these office types either.  Inform them in no uncertain terms that they are expendable - the printer is not.  6. Sell the printer for crack in Richmond.  IT'S THAT EASY!

      Same tired Beyonce jokes.  My very own top-level domain at last.  Can't wait to test drive it.  I've got something like 800 megs of space and tons of bandwidth.  I'm gonna cram enough whimsical musings down your collective throats that when you cough, all that'll come out is "Fuck Ikea".  Word is bond.  I have no idea if the old address will still update, so I'm gonna poke around and change all the links I can find, and see if I can put up a redirect from the old address.    When Webmaster Rachel and I get around to making a real website (Flash MX has a steep learning curve) we'll make that the page this address links to, and the blog will be reached via a link from there.  Fun times ahead.

      With one year down, I'm plotting out some key directions the site will be taking in the coming months.  Limited only by cash and time, here's what I want to do:  1. New hosting.  Time to move up to the big show. 2. Another movie.  People liked the last one (by "people" I mean "friends I conned into watching it by telling them it was the Paris Hilton video") and I'm brainstorming for the next.  Jake wants to do another Kill Bill but I'm feeling the zeitgeist fading.  And my katana's pretty thrashed after that last movie. 3. This one's a little more long-term.  Rachel clued me into Cafepress's new publishing arm.  I want to put together enough material from this site for a book.  Large type with pictures because I am Lazyman. 4. Get an editor, because I don't know what I'm doing half the time. 5. More multimedia in general.  I've got a camera, I've got a mic and audio editing software, this site should be humming with sound and awash in JPGs. 6. Might buy some ads for the site.  I need to get more people coming here so they can tell me what they like.  Plus I just need a few more postcount points to get to 8th level so Ms. Frost can teach me real magic. (People like Jack Chick references, right?)

      I've been fishing for a raise at the bank for a week or two now, when my boss called me over for a pow-wow.  I asked her if more money was coming my way and she said no.  A raise just wasn't in the cards and neither was permanency.  She saw the dejection in my face and quickly piped up, "Oh, but we do want to worship you as a god."  Well, anyone who knows me will tell you that's all I've ever really wanted from a company.  Paid vacations and fat benefit packages are nice, but worship and servitude is something money can't buy.  I immediately signed up.    Benefits include:  1. A magnificent altar consecrated to My name will be built in an unused cubicle.  2. A temp will be sacrificed in My name every full moon.  3. My name has been changed to the much cooler, Moorcockian-sounding Ma'ax.  The extra glottal stop is for extra POWER.  4. A festival in My honor will be celebrated for a fortnight in Midsummer, featuring bacchanalian wine orgies, ritualistic alpaca slaughtering, epic recitals of the Saga of Ma'ax, and free checking throughout July.  5. The bank's symbol has been replaced with a ram's skull.  6. A jihad against the heathen idolators in Account Reconciliation.  7. "Covered Head-to-Toe in Lamb's Blood" Fridays.  8. I will be growing several extra arms.  9. A fundamental shift in the company's mission statement away from "Providing financial solutions for individuals and small businesses," towards "Serving the undying will of Overlord Ma'ax the Unconquered, Tamer of Beasts, Slayer of Tiamat, in whose Presence we soil ourselves with adulation".

      I meant to say some more funny stuff before, but I just found out my friend Ryan Boell (Angelsboi from EN World) died of AIDS-related illness a few hours ago, with his friends and family by his side in Atlanta.  I chatted with him a few times, and used to love reading his wrap-ups on Buffy and Angel in the TV forum.  Later on, I (and lots of other EN Worlders) became very wrapped up in his trials with AIDS.  I'll never forget the day he went on the forums and posted that he had found out he had AIDS - I've never been so upset over something I read on the internet in my life (not to mention upset over the small-minded PIGFUCKERS who had to pipe up and say how "something like this doesn't belong on a gaming board").  I may not have known him as well as his IRL friends but I admired him in his strength and empathized with him in his struggles.  From reading his posts on the forums and his Livejournal, I came to know him as a free spirit who loved life very fully and openly.  He was a really special guy and I'll miss him a lot.  People are eulogizing him on  urlLink this thread .  His Livejournal is  urlLink here .  Even if you didn't know him, give these a look.  He touched a lot of people's lives in big and small ways.  Good night Ryan...

      First off: apologies to everyone for my spacing out.  You see, yesterday was the one year anniversary of Max's World and I had a big bash planned to celebrate it.  There was going to be a live party with full webcam coverage from the Viper Room in LA.  A couple of hot up-and-coming bands were booked.  The Wayans brothers were all set to host.  But there was a problem with the lighting, Marlon threw a man-hissy over some overcooked oysters in the green room, and I finally just said "fuck it" and did what I do every Tuesday night: get hammered on peach schnapps, roll around in honey and watch  Back to the Beach .  A good time was had by all.  Just handed to me from my South Bay correspondent Jennifer Lopez: July 31st is  urlLink World Wide Flush Day .  At 5 PM P.S.T. we are all to flush our toilets in unison.  Do what you can to help settle this age-old bar bet.  Scientists at the University of Virginia have posted a  urlLink .wav file  of the sound of the Big Bang.  It's funny; the voice of God sounds less like Charlton Heston and more like a futuristic toilet flushing.

      Rachel, her brother Mike, his girlfriend Vanessa and myself took in the 8:00 show at Cobb's last night.   urlLink Chris Hardwick  opening for  urlLink Patton Oswalt .  Good guys.  Evening a bit marred by the presence of not one but two bachelorette parties, which apparently are the fire ants of the stand-up comedy picnic.  Chris mentioned he played D&D; I now officially wanna get in a game with him and Wil Wheaton.    Oswalt rocked the house as I predicted to my non-Oswalt-recognizing friends he would.  Got no boos on his Bush stuff, which stands to reason in SF but you never know (except for the dumbass drunk bachelorettes who said "Politicsssh aren't funnnny"; hey, help yourselves to a steaming cup of Shut the Fuck Up).  His discussion on 80's metal videos was rad.  Ted Nugent can deflect bullets in real life though, right?  On the way out the comics were doing the meet-and-greet, and I saw Mike Phirman (who played a few songs with Hardwick at the end of his set).  I gave him the obligatory You Rock and I got the obligatory Thanks, Man, at which point I told him I fucking loved Rodeohead and his ears pricked up.  Ah, a real fan!  I got a soul-brother handshake from him and left the club feeling quite confident in my hipness.

      Very slick movie.  Definitely the best of the three so far.  Alfonso Cuaron has got directing style for days.  It has the look of an old-timey film with "tunnel"-style dissolves between scenes, and some really gorgeous shots of the Scottish countryside.  The kids are much better in their roles than they've ever been.  That said, I am a little disturbed about something - the story editing.  I understand that they can't translate every subplot and detail from the book to the screen, but I was quite frankly astonished at a couple of important (IMHO) plot points that were left out, i.e. the identities of the Mischief Makers and why Harry's Patronus is a stag.  As someone on EN World explained to me, the base assumption of the filmmakers seem to be that the audience has read the book and that's just the wrong assumption to make (3 out of 4 of the people I saw it with hadn't).  A better assumption would be that the audience has seen the previous films and go from there.  It doesn't give me a lot of hope for the next few films, given how much story they're going to have to axe to bring it in under 3 hours.  I will hereby abandon the tired "X amount of stars" summary.  Instead I will be judging the film against tracks on the Beatles' seminal 1968 release  The Beatles  (known in these parts as the "White Album").   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban =   Dear Prudence.   Strong, moody, maybe not lead single-worthy but holds up to multiple listenings/viewings.  In the end it'll be everyone's second favorite, except that one guy who dresses in black and thinks Chris Columbus is the Wings-era McCartney next to Cuaron's  Plastic Ono Band.

      I'm going out to see Prisoner of Azkaban tonight with a bunch of people.  This was my favorite of the books and I hear it's the best of the movies so far.  Full details when I come back.  In other news, I saw that  urlLink SongMeanings  is back up.  That's by far the best lyric site I've been to, not the least of which is for the comment feature so you can discuss, well, the song meanings.  I was just reading the one for  urlLink Stairway to Heaven  and it's the funniest comedy I've read in a while.  It's a completely meaningless song, people, or as close as you can get to meaningless.  My favorite is the guy who says it's about how the TeleTubbies are trying to take over the world.  I know he's joking and all, but that sounds about as plausible as people who say "Frodo is looking to the West!" or "'A bustle in your hedgerow' is a sex metaphor!".  Well, that last one might be true...but "I'm gonna try and tame your little red love machine" it ain't.

      Early response has been very good about the new Max's World (Typical focus group response: "We like that you got somebody who's 'TV-Ugly' for the main character") so consider it done.  And hey look, it even has a little picture of me, in trendy nightvision no less!  So now all of you strangers who haven't watched the Kill Bill video know what I look like.  Or know what I look like as if you were Buffalo Bob at the end of Silence of the Lambs.  And who hasn't wanted to do just that?  Max's World: Making intarweb dreams come true!

      Sunday arrived bright and on time, and I got the smart idea to go to Ikea to purchase an entertainment unit for my living room.  (If you don't have an Ikea near where you live, it's a furniture store, rougly the size of your average Death Star, that traffics in inexpensive furniture that's held together mostly by particle board, allen-head screws, and the power of prayer.)  With some quick measurements of the space around our TV we hopped in the Toyota and rolled out to Emeryville.  As we entered the building we had to run a gauntlet of shoppers leaving, all of whom had the same shell-shocked, dead-eyed looks on their faces as concentration camp survivors.  We boarded an escalator and looked down to see a plexiglassed kid zoo.  I guess you're supposed to leave your kids there while you shop, but it looked to me more like grist for some child's future therapy sessions.  Shell of a man: "You mean, the reason I cry everytime I orgasm is my mom left me in the Ikea for Kids play area?"  Therapist: "You've just made a huge breakthrough.  That'll be 300 space dollars."  Space dollars.  Because it's the future.  Get it?    Where was I?  Oh yeah, hell on earth...  So they made us walk a couple of furlongs through the store before we found the department we were looking for.  After an hour of brow-furrowing and consultations with my measurements (which it turns out I wrote in a burst of automatic writing, using an antiquated dialect of Sanskrit that I don't actually read), I realized they didn't have one piece of furniture that fit around my TV.  Apparantly I'm the first man on Earth to own a 51" Sony television.  While that filled me with pride, pride won't hold a DVD/VCR combo deck and a cable box.  So it was on to Plan B: shelving.  Rachel found some shelves we both liked, and saw that they also had upright pillar shelves in a strangely similar style.  In a MacGyver moment, we decided we could buy two pillars and a shelf and put the shelf on top of the pillars, and bada-bing, that's entertainment (unit).  We copied down the product numbers as well as the aisle and bin numbers, which perplexed us a bit.  Our paper looked like the phone number for an office extension in Tehran.  We were directed by the staff to go downstairs (closer towards Inferno) to the "Self-Serve Area".  We finagled a handtruck and headed towards the first product on our list, which of course wasn't in the veneer we wanted.  Then there's some confusion.  Why are the side pillars in the same bin as the shelf, and they're all have the same icon on the box?  Which part is which?  What madness is this?  I spent an interminable amount of time standing around by our carts while Rachel ran upstairs to look at the shelf.    When she got back, my suspicion was born out: they were the same damn piece.  They mounted one horizontally on a wall and gave it a different product code.  I felt my last few points of Sanity evaporate away and hefted up a third "side pillar" (sigh).    Soon we maneuvered our 200 pounds of wood through the lolly-gagging crowd (To all the slow  people in front of us who pretended we and our huge cargo didn't exist: By Zeus, I will make orphans of your children, so swear I) to the checkout lines.  The best part of the trip was that the lines weren't nearly as bad as I'd heard they could be.  So they've got that going for them.  Some helpful tips for the prospective Ikea shopper:  1. Let your family know you're going so arrangements can be made if you snap and take hostages.  2. If you see a vision of a temptress standing in front of a fire door, beckoning you to freedom, that's just Satan fucking with you.  There are no easy exits in life or Ikea.  3. Do not go with a hangover.  Do go drunk, though.  4. You won't find what you want on your first trip.  Don't count on finding it on the second either.  Fortunately for you, Emeryville has many low-priced inns and residence hotels nearby so you can continue attacking it without wasting gas.  5. Rent a semi.  Seriously, these boxes are huge.  We buried my grandfather in a smaller box (also purchased at Ikea).  6. The numbers on the tags don't mean anything.  They're a code to weed out the dull and witless among us.  Every box downstairs contains the same volume of particle board and allen-head screws - only the directions change.

      The hit counter's gone nuts lately. A quick look at bStats said that I was 9 short of a 1000 for the month, putting me at my best month, uh, ever. Several months worth, actually. But now I really need to put this bitch over the top. So here's a nice bedtime story for all you Googlers out there.   Once upon a time, a knight with the unfortunate name of BEYONCE'S ASS sought to free the beautiful Princess LINDSAY LOHAN from the castle of BOOBS. But the Castle BOOBS was guarded over by a wicked wizard named VIN DIESEL BARE CHEST, who wielded the terrible power of ATKINS DIET. But Sir BEYONCE'S ASS was not afraid of VIN DIESEL BARE CHEST, and rode forth on his faithful steed UNCLAIMED MONEY.  BEYONCE'S ASS strode to the castle wall, and called out to his foe, "Come and face me, VIN DIESEL BARE CHEST, that I may smite you with my Sword of KOBE BRYANT." But alas, VIN DIESEL BARE CHEST was a PUSSY, and he fled to his tower in the kingdom of HOT CHICKS. So BEYONCE'S ASS, victorious over his cowardly enemy, claimed LINDSAY LOHAN as his bride, and they both lived happily ever FREE MP3s.

      I had a realization this week that, as a newly-minted Jewish banker, I'm embodying one of the oldest and ugliest cultural stereotypes in the world.  I couldn't get any closer to a KKK caricature if I were a rooftop fiddler.  But what am I to do?  Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly, and Jews have to secretly contol the world via a massive  urlLink Zionist banking conspiracy .      I think there should be a union for people in culturally stereotypical careers.  We'll call it the "Racist Joke Punchline Workers Union".  Mexican gardeners.  Chinese dry cleaners.  Italian waste-disposal experts.  Russian gangsters.  Black pimps.  South American druglords.  Japanese ninjas.  Finally, a banner we can all stand proud under.  Look for the union label whenever you need hedges trimmed, a suit pressed, a high-interest loan, your balls cut off, a ho, several kilos of fine Colombian blow, or the stealthy elimination of a rival warlord.

      And also a Sacramento band.   urlLink My brother  put up a link to a sample of their new album called "Wheels" and it's more awesomeness from John McCrea and crew.  My brother met John McCrea at the Unlimited Sunshine tour and now thinks he's all that.  "Meeting him", so what?  I got him to play "Mr. Mastodon Farm" at the Green Christmas Ball in 19-effin-96!  I got trampled at that same concert-- for him!  I'M HIS BIGGEST FAN, and as soon as I let him out of the 5'x5' concrete room in my garage where he gets to be my best friend I can keep him from seeing all those phony people who claim to be his friends and family, he can tour the country and you can see why he's worth all the effort!    But first it has to put the lotion in the basket.

      Seen this on a few blogs lately. It's the 100 highest-grossing films of all time. Boldfaced titles indicate one I saw in theaters, asterisked ones are films I've seen on TV or video.     1.  Titanic*  SUCKED.  A woman's heart may be a "deep ocean of secrets",  but this movie was a shallow pool of dog vomit.    2. Star Wars   I'm counting the re-release as "seeing it in theaters".  Probably the second most influential movie for me after The Godfather.    3. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial   Watched it again on video a year ago.  Boy, was this just a lot better at the time?     4. Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace    5.  Spider-Man   Spiderman 2 should be up here soon.    6. Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King     7. Passion of the Christ  Complete with people collapsing in prayer in the aisles. This movie will suck on DVD if for no other reason than no strangers testifyin'.    8. Jurassic Park    9.  Shrek 2     10. Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers     11. Finding Nemo     12. Forrest Gump     13.  Lion King, The*    14. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone     15. Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring      16. Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones      17. Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi   Ah, the only one I saw in theaters the first time around. Although apparently I saw ESB at a drive-in when I was 3, but I couldn't recall. Anyway, I always loved this one, so poo-poo on the haters.    18. Independence Day    19.  Pirates of the Caribbean     20. Sixth Sense, The (1999)   The amount of people who claim to have figured out the twist before the ending has recently exceeded the amount of people who claim to have been at Woodstock.    21. Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back    22.  Home Alone    23.  Matrix Reloaded, The    24.  Shrek    25.  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets     26.   How the Grinch Stole Christmas  How could this possibly beat Boris Karloff?    27.  Jaws*    28. Monsters, Inc.   Still my favorite Pixar movie.    29. Batman   Saw it again recently.  Has not aged well.   30.  Men in Black     31.  Toy Story 2*      32. Bruce Almighty*     33.  Raiders of the Lost Ark*  Best.  Entrance.  EVER.    34. Twister    35. My Big Fat Greek Wedding    36. Ghost Busters   I had to leave halfway in because the scene where Dana gets possesed freaked me out.  Hey, I was 7.  Still count?    37. Beverly Hills Cop   Somehow I was a huge Eddie Murphy fan by age 7.    Loved his stand-up albums.    38. Cast Away      39. Lost World: Jurassic Park, The     40. Signs    41. Rush Hour 2   42. Mrs. Doubtfire*  Well, I still haven't seen it all the way through, but probably seen the whole thing in pieces.  Meh.   43 .  Ghost (1990)  *   Ruined that song for me forever.  You know which one I'm talking about.   44. Aladdin*    45. Saving Private Ryan     46. Mission: Impossible II     47. X2      48. Austin Powers in Goldmember     49. Back to the Future   Still great.    50. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me   Seemed a lot funnier in the theaters.  Not as good as Goldmember, innafinalanalysis.    51. Terminator 2: Judgment Day   First FX movie that made me go "wow".   52. Exorcist, The*    53. Mummy Returns, The     54. Armageddon     55. Gone with the Wind  Havent' seen it.

I choose not to weigh in on the controversy, except to say that the twist in the remake was way lame compared to the Statue of Liberty ending in the original.    73. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom   Went to the premiere!   74. Pretty Woman  I'm like the only person I know who hasn't seen it.  I wear that as an oddly-shaped badge of honor.   75.

      The bank's HR department called me before lunch yesterday and made me an offer I couldn't refuse. Starting next Monday I'll be a permanent employee of the bank. I can finally start telling people I work FOR the bank, not AT the bank.     So who says perseverance never pays off? Well, me, usually. But here's to inertia, eh? To all of you temps out there: If you can just live through 22 months of a dead-end temp gig, you can score a nice dead-end permanent gig.     It's been an interesting and entertaining two years. You get to meet the neatest people when you temp, like Jake and the Shark Lady. Bosses seem to be a lot cooler to temps from what I've seen, or maybe it's just the shabby bosses I had before that. Most bosses see temps the way they would see the world's smartest dog - sure, catching frisbees with your mouth isn't that big a deal in the long run, but aren't you just so cute and spunky? Who cares if Mr. Unemployable only does half as much work as everyone else and looks bored doing it?  It's just so peachy keen that he can do any work at all! Good boy!

      Just came back from a nice little excursion that actually threatened to suck from the beginning.  Rachel got a wild hair up her ass to visit the Concord Flea Market out at the drive-in theater. It's as skeevy as it sounds, but I knew it would be. In days of my youth, I could be found trolling the booths looking for knives and swords. It was like a circus, only instead of elephants and jugglers it was implements of violent death. Well, they must have changed the laws or something because now they have precisely DICK in terms of weapons.  There was one bigass SCUBA knife but it was a little too plasticky. One guy was selling what looked like two nice buck knives when they were displayed in sheaths, but they were rusty and junky when you pulled them out. For this he wanted to haggle down from $12! What is this world coming to, when decent American like myself can't purchase sales tax-free swordcanes and pistol crossbows from unlicensed and poorly-groomed dealers.   Back behind the wheel and firmly in control of our destinies for the next few hours, I guided the Saturn towards Berkeley, or as I like to call it, the Place Where God Would Sit Down And Have A Sandwich. I'd been lobbying hard the last few days to try a new pizzeria called Gioia which every local food critic has been drooling over like it was a soft young boy at a NAMBLA meeting. I bought a slice of pepperoni for me and olive for her out of the sidewalk window. By Neptune's trident, this stuff is good! Thin, crispy but not cruncy, complex cheese (not rubbery cheapo mozzarelle), tasty sauce, and good grease. I folded that sucker, gobbled it down and chased it with an organic strawberry lemonade.   Rachel wanted to check out the nursery so I walked over to Monterey Market. Lo and behold,  urlLink   urlLink Frog Hollow  peaches! The only fruit that should be allowed to carry the name "peach"! I just ate one now and it was so damn good I had to write about it. If a Frog Hollow peach could bake a Gioia pizza I would marry it, make sweet tender love to it and have little peach babies.   You all need to start paying me for this site so I can move to Berkeley. I promise if you move me to Berkeley I'll never do the  urlLink Lord of the Underpants  again, and you'll never have to look at  urlLink this picture .

      I just killed a monster black widow in my garage.  It didn't just have a red mark, it had corporate sponsorship stickers like a NASCAR driver.  Drow were worshipping it.  I saw it chase a hobbit under my washing machine.  I bit IT, and it gained the proportional strength and agility of an out-of-shape temp.  I hit it with a rubber band and it just said "You call that a hit, faggot!" in the exact same voice as the drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket.  Finally I got out the broom handle and beat it to death, screaming "Mommy says you're naughty!  Mommy says you're naughty!"  Is it wrong that I want it to come back from the dead so I can videotape myself killing it this time?

      Max's World is dead.  Long live Wicked Machine!  All part of my meager attempt at respectability.  I can't help it; I want something that'll look nice on a business card.  Anyway, Wicked Machine is the umbrella under which I will now be producing this blog, along with video and art projects on this site.  One of these days I'll probably get around to filling out one of those fictitious business name petitions.  Then a li'l IPO, then I buy a private jet and whisk investors to parties on private islands in the Mediterranean, complete with ice sculptures that urinate vodka.    Tell your kids that you were there at the beginning, long before the corporate fraud indictments were handed down.  (All the old addresses will still work.  I just like this one more.)

      I was watching a commercial for LaBatt's Blue beer tonight that really spun me.  In it, a talking bear is playing softball with his buddies, who deride what they perceive should be his poor softball skills, as he is Canadian and lacks thumbs.  He knocks one deep into center and breaks someone's window.  As a "peace offering" he takes a six-pack of LaBatt's with him so as to ease the tension.    So right off the bat (pardon the pun) we see a number of things wrong in this situation.  1. Bears play soccer. 2. When they do play softball, they tend to pull to left field when they connect. 3. No one drinks LaBatt's.  So he arrives at the newly-defaced home, and who should answer the door but a Hot Chick.  This Hot Chick is not alarmed by the presence of a talking bear, one who may or may not already be liquored up on cheap beer.  As a matter of fact, she invites him in, and introduces him to her roommate Hot Chick #2.  Both Hot Chicks give him a randy look and the door is shut.  It was at this point that I realized that these two HUMAN women were going to fuck that bear.  You know, I was just starting to get over that Sunsetter awning commercial, and now this.  The moral majority in this country have got their collective hissies in a fit over profanity on the radio and violence on TV, and here's a Canadian company proudly promoting bestiality on our airwaves!  Where is the righteous anger?  Where are the crudely-acronymed parents rights groups like  P eople  A gainst  B ear  S ex on  T elevision (PABST, a blue-ribbon panel)?  Where is Jerry Falwell?  I'm writing letters expressing my grave concern to the ASPCA, both of my senators, the Commerce Dept., Tom Ridge, and the Prime Minister of Canada.  Then I'm taking my meds and going to sleep.

      On our way to a Gerry family dinner a month or so ago, Rachel and I started talking about what to expect that night.  I told her that I'd guarantee that if me, my dad and my uncles are all in the same room, eventually we'll start talking about the Godfather.  She naively thought I was joking, and maybe I was.  But when we walked in the room, there's my pop and his brothers, TALKING ABOUT THE GODFATHER.  Needless to say I dove right in.  In my grandparents' old house in El Cerrito there was a Godfather poster in the garage where I used to play with the iconic image of Marlon Brando stroking that cat, waiting for the next pitiable schlub to beg for his assistance.  I knew nothing about this movie but the image spoke to me in a way I didn't understand.    I have dim recollections of seeing it later as a child, and seeing Godfather Part III with my dad when that came out.  I didn't form a real opinion of it or Brando until I watched a taped copy of The Godfather Saga (a chronological edit of the first two movies, i.e. the De Niro scenes from Part II, then all of Part I, then the Pacino scenes from Part II) in high school.  I was  blown away , not just by the amazing filmmaking, but by Marlon Brando himself, who I mostly knew as Jor-El.   I immersed myself in Brando's work.  My dad and I rented The Wild One and I became the only kid at school who knew the answer to the question "What are you rebelling against?"  I vaguely recall attending a film history course in college, but I remember watching On the Waterfront there and loving every frame.  I saw his white head peek out of the shadows in Apocalypse Now, embodying a madness I'd never seen before or since.  I grinned all the way through Don Juan de Marco with him and Johnny Depp, watching two of my favorite actors of two different generations thoroughly enjoying themselves.  And it all brings me back around again to The Godfather, which I recently purchased on DVD.  Watching it, I find myself captivated over and over again with a film I know virtually by heart.  I dwell on the words that Brando delivered in his greatest performance, words about honor and family and loyalty and protecting the people you love. The fact that these words are coming out of the mouth of a murdering gangster doesn't detract from their power.    The Godfather's become such a touchstone for the men in my family that I don't know what we'd talk about exactly if it didn't exist, if Marlon Brando hadn't created such a character.  It's a shared experience that we've all interpreted in different ways, but which is no less profound for any of us.  In that film and throughout all of his work, he got down to the essence of what it means to be a MAN; the power that is inherent in masculinity and the ultimate responsibility it entails.  He taught us not to whine or cry over our misfortunes ( "You could act like a man! What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, some Hollywood finnochio that cries like a woman?" ), to be good to our families above all other concerns ( "Do you spend time with your family? Good. Because a man that doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man." ), and to be strong when others fail ( "I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can be careless. But not men." ).  So Marlon Brando will be greatly missed by the Gerry family.  If anyone needs me I'll be in the TV room, watching a snail crawl across the edge of a straight razor...

      You can go buy a Wicked Machine tee-shirt at Cafepress.com now.  My store's at  urlLink http://www.cafepress.com/wickedmachine .   This tee is made of organic cotton fiber; I wanted one made from a 50% tears of angels/50% shards of a thousand broken dreams polyblend, but Cafepress's selection is limited.  It's retailing for 20 bucks.  Expensive?  You bet.  Hey, those Guatemalan slave children aren't gonna not pay themselves.
