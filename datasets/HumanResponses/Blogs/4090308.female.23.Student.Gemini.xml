        It all started when a St. Louis bishop publically decreed that John Kerry should not "present himself for communion" in that particular diocese because of pro-choice stance on abortion. Since then, several Catholic bishops have echoed the sentiment - with few even saying that pro-choice parishioners are not to partake of the sacrament, either.    Conclusion? If you're like most Democrats in America today, no Body and Blood of Christ for the likes of you. Under the leadership of Pope John Paul II, the Catholic church has taken a hard-line stance not only on abortion, but also on gay rights and euthanasia. Some complain that the bishops' decrees are simply a matter of playing politics during an election year - something a tax-exempt religious organization is supposed to avoid - and others maintain that the bishops are correct: someone who believes in abortion (or as hard-liners would say, murdreing the unborn) has no right leading our country. As usual, the truth lies somewhere  between the two.    I'm a cradle Catholic: my mother taught parochial school for more than a decade (at the school my sister and I attended, no less!), we attend church every Sunday, and sometimes the priest joins us afterwards for breakfast. We're not sorta-kinda Catholic: the only valid excuse for missing Mass is dismemberment or death. I understand the hardline mentality of the anti-abortioners because I lived it.    My high school often sponsored bus trips to the Washington March for Life. Speakers informed my graduating class that fully one-third of our generation was aborted, and that women who get abortions often died during the procedure, or suffered breast cancer, or killed themselves in large numbers. Dismembered fetus photos didn't phase us: we had seen them on the walls of our classrooms, above the slogan Abortion is Murder.    Interestingly enough, however, no other social issues were mentioned through the course of our indoctrination. Though the Bible is full of examples of Jesus urging care for the poor, justice for the wronged, and forgivenes for the sinner, we never discussed American poverty, injustice in our legal system, or rehabilitation for prisoners. Caring for the poor was something  out there , in Latin America or dirty third-world counties where you were likely to pick up diarrehea and a tropical disease. Issues of race, class, gender, and equality were never discussed*. Who wants to ruffle feathers when we can all unite against the evil of Planned Parenthood?    This is the central problem with the Catholic leadership - and the Catholic voting block - in America today. We are more concerned about the suffering of a blob of cells with the potential for personhood than taking care of the real suffering of humans all around us. Social justice is a fine moral code for the poor and downtrodden in the third world, but here in America, we're too busy worrying about abortion to care about the gross inequalities in our society.  This is not simply a hierarchial problem: it happens in every church, every Sunday. During the intercessions, we pray for the soldiers in Iraq. We don't pray for the people whose homes we destroyed, whose children we killed, and whose country we invaded. One day, a lecteur had the guts to rectify that: not only did he offer up prayers for the Iraqis, but he also prayed for the Palestinians upon whom we were "committing genocide". After Mass, the congregation had a fit. These prayers were  not  acceptable, people repeated.    Even if someone is considered our enemy, didn't Jesus tell us to love our enemies? Shouldn't we care as much about the dead Iraqis as the dead Americans? Shouldn't they be allowed our prayers as well?  Evidently not, but it's okay to light candles for aborted fetuses at the side altar.    Catholics today have their priorities out of line. Should we support abortion? In a perfect world, no. In the world we live in, the overturning of Roe V. Wade would result in back alley abortion doctors and social upheaval. In a perfect world, women wouldn't have abortions - but they would have better sex education, which the Church of course opposes.    Often in America today, the anti-abortion candidate is also the anti-welfare candidate, the big-spender candidate, the tax-cuts-for-the-rich-and-the-lower-class-be-damnded candidate, the invade-other-countries-for-their-oil-and-lie-to-the-american-public candidate. And I don't know about you, but between dead fetuses and dead soldiers, dead fetuses and starving children, I'll take the dead fetuses. American Catholics need to wake up: abortion is bad, but human suffering is worse.     *All right, I think we read  Dead Man Walking  - once. It was optional, and since the pope said death was merited in extreme cases, the death penalty must be okay, because the pope can't be wrong and everyone knows those guys on death row did it anyway. I think Father also mentioned the criteria for a just war, but found Vietnam to be a righteous moral battle against the godless Commies.

      I was thrilled to wake up this morning and find out that Kerry and Edwards are embarking on a campaign tour "from sea to shining sea". First stop? Harrisburg and Scranton, two Pennsylvania counties that went Republican by a slim margin in the last election.    I was born and raised in Pennsylvania, but have since become an adopted South Carolinian. Down South, we have a tried and true aphorism about the Keystone State: Pennsylvania is Philadelphia and Pittsburgh with Alabama in between.    Check out the last gubanatorial election, which send former Philadelphia mayor Ed Rendell into Harrisburg: Rendell cleaned up in Philadelphia and its surrounding suburbs, due to his appeal as both Democrat and as a hometown mayor. He also picked up metropolitan Pittsburgh, whose strong labor presence can be counted upon to go red. However, the geographical majority of Pennsylvania - the Alabama contingent - went to the ballot box for Bob Casey, Jr. Luckily, there were enough Democrats in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh areas to win the day.    In the last presidential election, the results for the Philadelphia area were nearly identical, but with one important abberation. Philadelphia, Montgomery and Bucks Counties, known as the "Main Line" for their proximity to the city, all came out Democrat as predicted. But Chester County, on the western-most edge of the Philly suburbs, changed its record and voted for Dubya.   Why the turn-around? Though all the Philadelphia suburbs have high rates of real-estate development (think McMansions), Chester County has enjoyed an unprecendented rate of growth in the past ten years (think over-development and more McMansions). It has skyrocketed from an area of rolling farmlands to sprawling suburbs which now boast the highest per-capita income (and two of the biggest malls) in the state.    With the electorate more polarized than it has been in any time since the 1960s, Kerry and Edwards need all the votes they can muster, particularly in battleground states like Pennsylvania. In order to assure electorial votes, our  nouveau  JFK needs to reach out and win votes in hotly contested counties - and unlike some parts of "Alabama", Chester county could swing.    With high incomes and suburban sprawl, Chester County sounds stereotypically Republican. However, there is an important - and oft overlooked - factor: ISG Plate, formerly Lukens Steel, still operates out of Coatesville. Once the largest steel mill in the world, this plant supplied the materials for the World Trade Center and the Golden Gate Bridge. The US Army and Navy still purchase their armor there - and the surrounding town is dying.    It might be hard for Kerry and Edwards to pick up the secure suburbanites in yuppie Chesco. But Coatesville, propped up by its steel mill, is another story, with its population of predominately urban blacks and blue-collar union families. With five downtown Catholic churches, Kerry is sure to get a welcome reception as the first Catholic presidential candidate in decades; Edwards' milltown background will resonate with local workers, who have seen their pensions shrink and their health-care benfits shredded.    Kerry and Edwards need to pick up some votes in "Alabama", that's for sure. In this battleground state, every vote counts. But they also need to fight hard to get back the ground lost in previous elections. With the right strategy - emphasis on the middle class, on workers' pensions, on jobs and health care - Chester county, and particularly Coatesville, could go back to Democrat. It's up to Kerry, Edwards, and their campaign staff to tap their resources, mobilize the volunteers, and address the issues that these small-town, blue-collar voters want heard.
