        ...   Drei.   Kelley: WHAT HAPPENED TO NEW CANAAN?!?  Me:       ...remember that giant golf course we passed back there?  Kelley:   ...  Me:       I think that was New Canaan... ...   Yesterday was the first official day of summer, and it came  mighty  close to sucking, but we narrowly saved it in the bottom of the ninth-- partially accidentally.  First we went to the beach for an hour, did nothing (but I still got sand up my butt).  Then we went out for   sushi  , even though we weren't really hungry-- sushi's that kind of food that you can do that with. Once again, we were the  only  people in the restaurant.    I don't know how some businesses survive... like the fucking    LAMP SHADE STORE!!!!    (I'm sorry, I had to mention it!)... Don't lamps usually   come   with shades?  My dad's convinced that stores like that are really just fronts for  mafia  headquarters-- like the sushi place with no customers has 40 pounds of Cocaine in the back room (and the Lamp Shade Store houses a treacherous gang of gay redecorators).  After all the fun and adventures, I accidentally turned right instead of left out of the strip mall parking lot, and couldn't find a place to turn around again for 20 minutes.  It was getting dark and we were driving down this long winding road with trees on both sides and a giant golf course that ran for miles.  We were starting to get nervous when we pass this big green sign that says "  Welcome To New York  "  ...we look at each other and start   screaming  .  ...  Today it was   gross   and   rainy  , and I was working the  desk  from 3:00-closing.  I was all planning on going in at 2:00, but that didn't happen.  I   really   didn't feel like being friendly to customers today, but I went and I dealt.  I had to write   three   notes to the new desk girl about mistakes she made, and I didn't have the energy left at closing to make them " friendly notes ."  I don't have anything personnel against her, she just screws up a lot and fucks around all the time.  We fuck around all the time too, but we get our shit   done   first.  She's the daughter of one of the  trainers  though, so I doubt she's getting fired anytime soon.  I come home to a scene whose absence I had taken for granted over the past week or so:  My brother and all his "friends" stacked on top of the sofa, screaming all sorts of   o  f  f -color , racist blather and talking behind the back of whichever friend from their " skater " clique isn't there.  I was hoping it would be a couple more days before I had the pleasure of seeing them again, but no such luck.  I feel really down and   anti  -social.  Everything I do I'm dragging.  I played with my  baby sister  a little this morning, after sleeping at my dad's house.  I love her so much, but I just  can't  be at my dad's house that often- I'll drive myself crazy (or my  step-mom  will do it for me).    Cried a little today (just a   little  ...)   This summer tastes funny.

        ...   Zwei.    I'll keep you like a secret. ...   The past few weeks ( months, years ) have been building up to this point:  Junior year is officially   over  .  In a little over two months I'll be parking in the  school-goddamn-parking lot !   Fuck  the Legion!  I really didn't feel like working today, and kept my fingers crossed that my boss wouldn't be in any mood to train me in the office.  The older of her two dogs had to be put down yesterday...  I found out when I showed up at two and everyone was standing outside; they sent me home.  It was really sad; she was a really sweet dog, and she lived a good long life.  ...So I called and they told me to come in, and I went, but I didn't take another shower!    Mwuah-hah-hah!    Working in the office isn't so bad.  It's not terribly exciting, but I get to kind of see how things work; I open bills and sort them, and file papers, and organize little things, and, of course, make " booklets ".  I     hate     "booklets".  Copying   page   after   page   of " Trainers' Tips! " and " Doggie Day Camp! "... Its cute, but not    that    cute.  Don't get me wrong, I    love    my job- I like the people there (most of them, at least...), I love dogs, and I feel so "accomplished" ( ::corny smile:: ) when I get things done, or when a customer on the phone says I've been "so helpful!" and asks for my name-  I   love   that.  I like playing with the dogs out on the floor, but I wish I could play with them all individually without them all getting jealous and clamoring for attention.  All the tedious organizing and   c  o  l  o  r   coding actually sort of fits with my anal-retentive perfectionist self.  (I like   c  o  l  o  r   coding!)  I don't know, I feel like some kind of weight has been lifted now that schools over, but I still don't really feel... I don't know...  free .    "Adulthood:  The land of anti-climaxes"

        ...   Eins.   Yossarian/Edna/Beth:    (glares evilly at self)  ...    I'm iffy about publishing personnel things here.  Almost all my past experiences with this type of thing end up going public (usually by way of my own fault).  I have the disease- when I write something I really like I have to show  somebody  (and I usually end up regretting it).    ...I like dogs better than people, ten times over.  It occurred to me the other day that I might be a... what's the word?  (-> urlLink  Dictionary.com , please)... a  misanthrope .  A  people-hater .  It sounds so...  evil  :/.  I don't hate all people, just mankind in general, I suppose.  Nonetheless, its not something I would go around telling people (although I kind of just did).  Maybe its just a phase and I'll grow out of it, along with all the rest of this adolescent  crap . That reminds me..  Yesterday was  Father's Day  ( dun... dun... DUN! ).  I went to CVS at the last minute to try and get my dad a card.  I was rushed for time- my English project group was meeting at my house in a couple minutes, and I was near panic...  The "Father's Day" card section was picked bone dry.  A  horrible  thought went through my head... I was gonna have to buy my dad one of those corny "poetic" cards with pictures of  flowers  and  sunsets  and shit like that... I couldn't let that happen!  But worse, I might have to go with one of those   cop-out   cards... you know, the ones with like, a picture of  Garfield/Snoopy/Mickey  on the front and the inside says something like:   "Have a  meowing/doggone/squeaking  great Father's Day!" .  The situation looked bleak... but then, a ray of light!  The  Shoebox  logo!  It was one lonely card, carelessly placed under the wrong holiday!  I crossed my fingers...  (please don't be about fishing... please don't be about fishing...)   And low and behold!  It was  perfect ...  On the front was a cartoon of a dad and a kid in the forest and the kid turns to the dad and says, "What are the names of all these trees, dad?" And the dad stutters and goes, "Uh... this one is... Phillip... and this one is... uh...  George ..." And so on, and then you open the card up and it just says,  " Fatherhood:  The art of making up crap on the spot. "

        ...   Vier.     "Perfect behavior is born of complete indifference."  ~Cesare Pavese ...    I was on a roll there for a while, posting every other day and all.  Ack, well...  It was bound to end sooner or later.  Last   Saturday   I covered the desk for one of the other desk girls, and at the end of the day, after counting out all of the cash for the deposit...  I lost it.   I   lost   the deposit...  just the   cash   part of it .    $283.33  .  Don't ask me how I lost it, because I don't feel like recapping again at this point (and I'm honestly not exactly sure).  My boss was   really   nice about it, though, nicer than she had to be.  She had me turn half the building upside-down searching for it for a couple of hours, meanwhile I was apologizing and offering her to take it out of my pay check and everything-- but, in the end she said she knew I didn't steal it, and its probably not coming out of my paycheck (I don't know how that works, but I'm not gonna challenge it...)  That freaked me out, big time.    Monday   night I met up with a couple of my friends and I had a new experience:  I smoked   p  o  t   for the first time!!   Whooooooooooooo-hoo!   At first it was bad...    really    bad, but by the end of the night I was having a lot of fun!  I had been with my friends when they lit up (I don't know how many times) before, so I thought I knew what to expect- but I was  wrong ...  At first I couldn't stop coughing, and my throat hurt, and I didn't feel anything and I was getting upset (even after I figured out how to inhale--   damn   that took a long time!)  and I had to walk outside on to George's little deck-thing to get some fresh air and I felt really nauseous and was starting to regret the whole thing, but things got better ;)  My friends were  really  high, higher than I remember them being, even when I was sober and they weren't.  Later on I actually had to drive, which was beyond stupid (and I had always reassured myself I would never do).  My friend sat in the passenger seat and told me "  Red light!  "  "  Green light!  " and, "  Your drifting too far to the left!  " all the way to her house, where we crashed for the night ( not literally ).  I still have a heaping bag of snack-cakes in the back seat.  The last couple days I've been working in the afternoons and then chilling at night, playing video games and messing around on the computer.  I only work 4-5 hours a day at work now, but I actually   work   for those 4-5 hours, not like days where I work 8 hours and spend three-and-a-half bullshitting around :)  I've been playing my brother's   Harvest Moon   for  GameCube , and I play more than he does.  I think he stopped because his friends didn't like it (actually, I'd bet money on it...)  hmmmm...  Well, Harvest Moon is an  acquired  taste....  and my knee smells like   p  e  e  .    "It will get cloudy today....  after the hurricane ."
