      Is it just me, or is the banking industry really headed for tough times ahead?&nbsp; Here I am trying to land a job in the industry, yet all these institutions want someone with experience.&nbsp;   I recently graduated from college with a degree in marketing and management, and it just seems that they want finance grads for those positions.&nbsp; My question is the following, how does someone that has not studied finance in terms of degrees, and has no experience in banking before, do well in interviews in order to land the job?

      Since I broke up with my girlfriend, it seems every girl out there wants to hang out, then start a relationship with me.&nbsp; Unfortunately for me, I am not interested in getting involved with another woman in a relationship.&nbsp; Its sad every single time, I become friends with a girl and then I have to let them know that I cannot be in a relationship, because I am still deeply in love with the exgirlfriend.&nbsp; The worst is that many of these women change their behavior towards me.&nbsp; They are not as friendly anymore, they do not call anymore, and they do not want to hang out.&nbsp; Yet everything I did was tell the truth, right off the bat.  Women it seems always want a guy who is honest and full of integrity like myself...but sometimes that integrity and honesty comes with a cost...perhaps better said 'past baggage'.&nbsp; Please help if you know a way on how to tell a woman, that you are not interested in a&nbsp;relationship maybe later...and continue the friendship as before.

      Dear Fellow BBS Grads:  I believe the Boccardo Business School is really shaping up to be one of the best in the West Coast. I am proud to have completed my undergrad education at such promising school. The Management Program led by professor like Dr. Anne Lawrence and Dr. Stanley Malos offer very challenging courses above Berkeley's and Stanford Business Schools. I would like to thank other professors like Professor William Dean who seems to know everyone in the Valley, and Professor Melchonian who challenges every mind in her lectures. Overall my decision to attend San Jose State University really opened my mind to a global platform to a business career. Thank you for all your dedication and support.   Unfortunately with all the budget cuts, programs do suffer from overcrowded classrooms, and overworked professors. As Alumni I encourage you to come back and give back to the school, and help build a reputation to be the best state school in the nation.  Sincerely, Carlos Barrientos  urlLink CLBARRIENTOS@msn.com  Class of 2004 "In Hoc"

      Mother F*&%!:  As SJSU Student I must say there is few of us that has one.  This is my review for my Treo 600. The hottest phone on the market, and I must say it has many glitches. Yes, I love the business making capabilities of it, but Darrn! the phone has many issues. Bad earpiece, makes me use speakerphone all the time. Buttons do not respond to simple commands. I hope the Treo 700 has less bugs.  urlLink http://www.mobileplanet.com/assets/product_images/MP170348.gif   Carlos Barrientos SJSU Class of 2004

      OKOKOK  So I have a serious case of senioritis at the moment.  I have one final case, one final exam, and one final class to complete the undergrad program San Jose State University.  Yet, I am just lagging, I just do not want to do any more work YUK!...but then I thought umm what would be a good solution to this senioritis...and I thought of Polarbear Rita Kirchhofer, and then I knew that writing my blogger for the day would be a good cure.  A hit of her and bit of writing and I am ready to continue the day.  Carlos Barrientos SJSU 2004
