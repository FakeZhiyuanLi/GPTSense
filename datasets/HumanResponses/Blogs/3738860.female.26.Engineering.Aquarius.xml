      so at lunch today, I got up as a waiter was approaching our table.. he looked up at me and exclaimed "you're so tall", to which I replied "ya-huh" and walked away..  I mean what does one say in response to something like that anyway?  "Yes, I'm a basketball player and I sub for volleyball on the weekends"  or "I've kept myself in traction most of my life to stretch my legs and torso to be the full 5'10" that I am"??  come on.. don't hate 'cause of my snobbish reply...

      How long will ATHF be underground?  Did anyone else see last night's episode, starring "Willie Nelson"?  The onion-spider hybrid who'll threaten you with his three blade aloe-strip electric razor?  Where do they get this stuff?  What about the hair piece that turned Carl into a clown who talked with a horn?  Master Shake "You got clowned", and they took that slang term to a new level..  Ok - and those 30 second "Dr. Evil" episodes - those are some wack cartoons..  "My asshole at last decided to eat my hand"..  Wow!

      I have a confession.  I'm an HGTV addict, an interior design wanna-be..  There's something insatiable about before and after shots of kitchens, bedrooms, yards - I can't get enough.  Change the channel and you're toast.  I know that home-makeover projects are main-stream these days, and once TLC came out with "Trading Spaces", the networks put their creative people to the test to capitalize on this modern craze.  So I am probably not alone with my confession, but I truly wonder if anyone else tunes in every weeknight and watch it from 8:00 to 12:00?  I mean I get elated when I hear that catchy-jazzy intro to Divine Design.  And who doesn't love Peter Fallico and his home-made simple furniture in Home to Go?  Design on a Dime and Decorating Cents are up there, but my favorite: Date with Design, where two people meet only after one has redecorated a room of their choice in the other's home.  Each night I say to myself "I can do this!"  And I'd be lying if I told you I didn't have a notebook full of ideas and concepts right there next to me..  I'm nutts!  So - to satisfy this craving, I've gotta get off my ass and do something about it..  I am looking in to Interior Design classes online or else at colleges in town.  I don't think I want to put in a full 5 years for a degree, but a few classes under my belt (and access to homes other than my own), maybe I could make a living outta this passion of mine..  This is my new area of focus, as I have free time now that the wedding planning is over...

      I wouldn't consider myself a political person, nor will this Blog be a politically charged one.. However, let me say this, while understanding that most apolitical people may choose to voice their opinions in an election year, such as this... *wink*  I want to believe in Kerry and I want to believe that he can support his campaign slogan "make America stronger at home and respected in the world"... but by telling me how he's a decorated Vietnam vet and how he voted (inconsistently as we've been told) as Senator - it doesn't light my fire.. does nothing for me.  I am hoping that throughout this week and in upcoming debates, I will learn more about Kerry and how he can be a strong leader and right some Bush-wrongs.  I want to know how he'll win back some worldly respect and settle this middle eastern 'indegestion' Bush has caused.  Oh - and tell me how pretty-boy Edwards is going to be a strong right-hand man..  His looks do nothing for me.

      Okay - I am sure legally I would be bound from soliciting any company or&nbsp;bashing any company in public if I were famous or had a reputation to withhold.&nbsp; But considering I am neither, I have something to say about liquid.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had an unpleasant experience with them and damn-it if I'm not going to write about it..&nbsp;  &nbsp; In May of this year, I wanted to try this online MP3 download thing - see how it worked.&nbsp; I found  urlLink www.liquid.com  via a google search and it seemed like a pretty good deal ($.99 / track - no monthly fees), but I had to download this special software before I could access the MP3s.&nbsp; After two download trials and issues with software compatibility, I finally got the desired track.&nbsp; However, my bank account said I downloaded 3 in total.&nbsp; (yeah - ok - so we're only talkin $.99 each track here - but it's the principle of the thing, right?)&nbsp; I emailed their support line right away but never got a response.&nbsp; So here I am, 2 months later, keeping with the&nbsp;'principle' spirit and standing my ground! &nbsp;  A call to their support line takes you right to a support person (no electronic greeter, no call queue - should I be warned at this point?!).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I explained the issue and they said they could easily credit the 2 charges back to my account.&nbsp; Ok - great - except I just closed that credit card.&nbsp;&nbsp; The supervisor tells me "Who authorized this account close?!&nbsp; We have no way of crediting money back to an account that doesn't exist."&nbsp; That was his response!!&nbsp; This set me&nbsp;off - I told him that he should modify his system 'cause I am sure there are people out there opening / closing accounts all the time.&nbsp; "Well,&nbsp;I am sure that most online merchants are not able to handle the case where accounts are closed" - oh really??!&nbsp; Pay Pal - Ebay??!&nbsp; They only allow credits on the same account? Come on!!  &nbsp;  So I made the "out-of-the-box" suggestion to give me a voucher / coupon or something to refund the money should I make another purchase.&nbsp; "Um.....&nbsp; *pause - lightbulb goes on*..&nbsp; yeah, we could do that.&nbsp; Just email me once you've made the purchase..&nbsp; "&nbsp;  "Well, I actually emailed you guys 2 months ago about the issue when my account was OPEN and never received a reply", I said hurriedly.&nbsp; "Ok, well let me check that the email is working..&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah - it's working.&nbsp; So just email me and I'll credit you those two tracks."&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Dummy!&nbsp; So I'll have to go and download 2 tracks.. and on top of all this - these tracks do nothing for me since they're all protected - cannot burn them, cannot move them to flashdrive - can only play them on my computer - whoopdie-freakin-do..&nbsp; What good are they if I can't take them with me or play for other people?!&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Lesson: This is why customers get irate -&nbsp;when the person their working with tells them "No - not possible"&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the&nbsp;customer will always come back with&nbsp;"Well then MAKE&nbsp;it possible BITCH &nbsp;'cause I'm not taking NO for an answer!!"   *deep breath*   -K

      just finished reading an article in Elle titled "Guilty Bride".  Being so recently a bride myself, I found this article rather intriguing and it made me feel better about my 'new identity', as I may call it.  'This article was a first person narrative from a woman who embraced the single life.  Put in 10 years to build her career and loved the single life with all its drinking, smoking and random hookups.  She dreamed of her future as  free lancer in France riding her bike to work and being very happy if she never found a 'life mate' or got married.  And should she ever decide to marry, it would be very small wedding, no bridesmaids and less than 50 guests.  However, when she finally met that someone her wedding turned into a year long engagement, with 3 bridesmaids in matching dresses and the entire wedding hoopla to go along with it.    "Guilty Bride" goes on to explain the Third Wave of Feminism: women who work hard to create a clear sense of of self with full independence while at the same time they embrace the traditional package of weddings and marriage.  Through this internal struggle, they get angry at themselves that they buy into the commercialism and sad that they're not "better than that".   One reason they may 'fall' into this habit is the purpose of the wedding itself:  It's an "archetypal experience" where women face the psychological process of leaving their old life and beginning a new one.  It forces them to engage with problems of culture and history and decide for themselves how they will maintain or reshape traditional roles in their marriage.'  This article was a perfect read for me.  It helped me accept the feelings I've had throughout the engagement process and now, as I see myself as a "wife".  Just last week, I found myself elated to use my new standing mixer to make a german- chocolate cake in mini-bundt size serving sizes - I was so proud!!  While, at the same time, I am slow to admit that I'm a 'house wife' or a 'married woman'.. I think the connotations and past images associated with those words are what I don't like about them.  I want to define my own gender and household roles - just as any other new bride out there..  I'll take satisfaction in the new appliances I've received and I'll dream of the many home-cooked meals I'll make for family and friends.  Yet, I'll make sure to get out of the kitchen and push myself in other non-traditional woman roles.. I'll help along this third-wave of feminism.. and be prepared for my future daughters who will bring along the 4th or 5th waves (yikes??!!)

      this past holiday weekend I spent with my family.  my parents have been divorced for 14 years now, and I still find myself focusing on ways to ensure my time is split equally between them, each time I go back home or even total time throughout the month / year.  I've gotten pretty good at this over the years - to the point that I'll bend over backward, tell lies, cut my hours of sleep to ensure that no parent feels slighted.  On top of this, my husband's parents (just celebrated 25 years - Congrats!) live another 45 minutes from Mom - which is more driving time and time-equality equations.  Through all of this, I've realized that part of growing up is learning how and when to stand your ground, and when to stop trying to please your parents.  I've learned that I just need to be honest with them, and MYSELF, and try the best I can while realizing I cannot do it all, all the time.  This is a hard lesson to learn, to always keep it in mind and still be respectful and fair.  On my most cynical days, I think I'll move to Colorado and use air fare as an excuse..  =)

      Jammin to Black Eyed Peas (BEP) on the way in to work this morning..  "Yo Mama - shake that beat that make you go Mama..." - kickin'! (imagine myself clubbin, up on stage - shakin my ass.. Yeah - IMAGINE - 'cause I don't get out much anymore =).. But I digress..  So track 3. "Let's get retarded" - doesn't the radio version go "Let's Get it Started"?? Am I right on this one?  If so, I'm wondering why they had to edit it?  Is "retarded" sensitive to the public listener?  I mean "retarded" isn't like Juvenille's latest Slow Motion - "She fucked up from the charm,She love the way the dick stay hard from 12 till early in the morn..." - I understand why that edit that stuff.. but retarded?  Is it sensitive because it's not PC?  Do the radio editors look at "retarded" as an equality-sensitive word where it could be offensive to those persons who are physically challenged (is that the PC term of the year??).   Perhaps they really mean the original definition:    re·tard1    urlLink   ( P )   Pronunciation Key   (r-tärd)v. re·tard·ed, re·tard·ing, re·tards v. tr.    - To cause to move or proceed slowly; delay or impede. Maybe BEP wants everyone to slow-the-f*&$-down and enjoy life..?  Or maybe retarded just wasn't the right word for the song in the first place.. I imagine this song playin up in the club, everyone singin.. "Let's get retarded" - then the music stops..  Did we all just say "retarded".. I think of Cartman and his attempt at Special Olympics "Deerrr.. I'm retarded"..  BEP - if you're gonna get censored, do it for a good reason - Retarded doesn't cut it.

      My oh-so-large fan base has expressed its concerns.. saying "focus" is getting too deep..  After reviewing some of my entries, I can see how one might walk away not feeling all that great after reading this stuff (and yet maybe it's what keeps you coming back? Kinda like a bad car wreck?) Either way, let me try to lighten it up - afterall, in person, I am a light, friendly, jovial kinda person..  (I guess I don't let my deep thoughts affect my personality all that much)..  So - no apologies, no regrets..  keep on keepin' on

      (As if I were a newspaper Editorialist...) Let me say that my mom isn't all bad..  There are many great qualities about her (of which I shall enumerate in a later posting).   It's just I am currently caught in this infinite loop of childhood-adulthood evaluation and how it plays into my recently adjusted relationships with my husband and parents.  On top of this, my brother is going to be a dad in 2 months and my Mom, technically a soon-to-be-grandmother, is despised by my brother (in the same loop as I).   As an introspective, highly analytical person (and a solemn idealist), I am guessing that I am thinking and assessing this MUCH MORE than anyone normal person would.  The Defense rests, your honor.

      Zodiac signs have always been a bit fascinating to me. Each time I read Aquarius personality traits , I have to wonder how the time of year I was born can truly grant me certain characteristics.. or maybe the more I read the more I am changing to match what is expected of me.... In any case, here's the latest one I've read @  urlLink http://www.miltonblack.com.au/astrology/sunsigns/aquarius.htm    "Your most marked characteristic is your tolerance for people and ideas You are driven by a love of humanity. Your sincerity, understanding and friendliness ensure harmonious relationships for you, and help you maintain equilibrium in the face of even the most adverse circumstances. This sign is considered the most spiritual. Your calmness can, however, lead to a tendency to daydream. Your idealism may rob you of decisiveness and the ability to cope practically with the concrete necessities of life. You are a bit of a doubting Thomas, too, prepared to question traditional beliefs.  You rebel against authority, preferring to find new ways of thinking and of action. You have a highly inventive mind and excellent reasoning faculties. You love nothing better than contesting thorny issues. You thrive on intellectual stimulation and alternative views. You are quickly bored by small talk...  You require a great deal of personal freedom and are fixed in your pursuit of this. You tend to love people in general, but very rarely let another get too close. You do not like being possessed, even by those you love to distraction. Others find you aloof and unreadable at times, a bit vague and distant. Yet you are exceedingly loyal to your close friends...."  hmm...

      it happened 14 years ago and I still get ill thinking about it.  Throughout these 14 years I've found many pieces to solve the 'mystery' - and as of last week, I think I just might have completed the puzzle..  No member of my family, let alone my parents, would have told a 12 year old that mom was off snooking a 24 year old man. My mom had an affair and my dad caught her red handed. There - I said it. It disgusts me still. Disgusts me knowing that this man then moved into my home, displaced my dad and tried to get buddy-buddy with us. oh yeah.. playing Nintendo was cool and ooh - he had season hockey tickets - I still hate hockey...  The small detail I discovered last week sealed the word 'affair' in my mind..  It's surrounded by slime and smoke - it taints the image of my mother.. I feel like a child again and my nicely damned adolescent angst floods my thoughts and emotions all over again.  I went away to school to get out of the house - I purposefully applied for a job out-of-state because I didn't want to be near enough to her.  I often think how my life might be different if she hadn't been so selfish, so disrespectful, so deceiptful. If she wasn't happy, why didn't she just say so - work it out - or just leave and THEN find someone else..  But in the same breath, I wish she would do more things for herself, and not selflessly give to her kids or her family.  Her incessant motherhood keeps her from being an adult-friend to me as I've grown up...  Does any of this really matter?  Yet, perhaps this was how it was supposed to be..  If it had not happened, I might still be that good-little-girl, naive and content with my 4-person nuclear family.  I might have stayed home for college and moved back home to save for a wedding.   I might have been closed minded, uninteresting and dull =)  I admire those who can say 'my parents' without any further clarifications and yet I am thankful for the extra-extended family I do have.  I can't forgive my mom just yet - perhaps time will heal - but why does it still hurt after 14 years?

      So I liked what Kerry had to say - he caught me with his charisma and topics of speech.  He had me believing in his dream and putting his vote on my ballot.  But now I'm back to square one listening to Colin Quin interview on NPR right now.   Quin is making points on Kerry's comments about removing privileges from the rich and giving more to the poor - and how impossible this is as long as we're greedy people.  And how he suddenly became 'charged' in his campaign, where he had only ever been complacent and rather rigid in any other point in this campaign.  Meanwhile, NPR interviewed Senator Robert Byrd last week and his new book on how horribly power-hungry Bush and his campaign are - how they've done nothing but disregard our country's constitution and 'rule' (as a monarch) for his own personal gain.  My own personal take on Bush - F&%$ him for preying on the faith of Christians in this nation to sway their vote - what happened to separation of church and state.  I saw him when he came to Cincinnati to speak this year - and I kindly denied the Bush-Cheney flash posters and sat quietly while everyone else cheered and applauded his bullshit..  Perhaps my hate for Bush will sway my vote.. funny how I read this weekend how some folks are voting for "anyone who's not Bush".  I like them.  All in all - I praise NPR for topic variety and thank them for this useful information.  I have 3 months of research remaining to do my duty as a citizen to pledge my vote.    And my political segment is complete.
