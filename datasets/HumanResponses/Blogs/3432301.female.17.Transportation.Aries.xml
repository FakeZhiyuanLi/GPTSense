You're my friend"( i know very sentimental dream about someone ive never met) and shes like just get out and so i get out and i have one of those like bags on a stick you know and I'm like walking along the road and this truck driver drives past after like an hour of no one and is like wanna ride and I'm like no thanks... and I walk down the side of the mountain to the beach and am just sitting there and then my dog woke me up

      So... I'm hoping if I write in this enough today I won't ever have to again...ha.. naw ..i love talking to myself! SO i just ate sushi..actually no i just had broth but it was at a sushi restaurant...sickness is god's way of telling me that I look like a whale....well I really just wrote in this to remind myself to not give in to what I've been struggling with and I was about to pick it up a second ago and let myself get trampled on again.. but no... I really am not going to because I'm smarter than that... WELL I'm really excited for when what I loved so much will happen again and I love than no one is going to know what the fuck I'm talking about aha and I love my like 40 line sentences.. yep. If any of you were wondering I'm really horny...not that anyone who knows me would think anything of that statement...but I really mean it today...Like yes. I must have some guy chromosomes somewhere in my body or something cuz I really can't remember a time in my life when I wasn't horny except for when I think about that one person... no 3... no 11 but still when u compare that to the millions of people that make me horny it's nothin... AND REMEMBER... ANIMALS ARE PEOPLE TOO! ok I promise not to write in this anymore tonight off to hmk and other fun things   If you want me call me ;)

      I'm so happy for some reason...It'll be gone soon though don't worry! Hmm getting my little sister's friends drunk Friday was loads of fun as was vegging and watching Beavis and Butthead Do America...with derry.... fun stuff...Today is Father's Day...hmm...I wonder what my father thinks on this holiday...ah well..I get good food and good company...anddddddd Kurt's comin home today!! :) I so excitededed...my room is so very clean hehe..Summer school starts tommorow...so I have planned that the hours between ss and dance.. i go to the beach and kurt hopefully can come as well as anyone else who wants to join...that way I'll see sunshine at some point during my summer! i have to prepare an act for "Cry Me A River" for Musical theater...she wants it vampy haha interesting woman...and I have to buy a creative journal and find 5 phrases that make me cry, laugh, giggle or something of the sort for Acting class...that woman is hillarious... at some point I'm gonna write an entry just about her...she's soooooooooo funnaaaaaaaay! Oh and amy and I have decided we are not getting old after going to those classes.>>IN acting there was this woman who was I'd say in her 60s and she was telling her life story and it involved almost becoming famous a million times and she had worked wth all these people who are now famous but she was not able to because she didnt have the money to get her equity card...and when she had the chance she had kids so she became a therapist and she was like I feel so lost...I feel dead...and I was like OMG...I'm never doing anything I dislike and NEver passing up a chance...and shooting myself if I do...and she was like I skipped my grandsons like highest baseball game for this class...I feel dead...my god...haha and shes a therapist...anyway..I'm off to lift weights and enjoy the day...If someone ruins my mood..they will pay :) later days

      Ok...I've found that my vacation will most likely be a trip to San Fransisco and then a drive down the coast to San Diego..fun stuff...maybe I'll bring a friend or two... alright and I've also found out that we might rent an apartment in Evanstonish like...and then find a house in the city instead of what was planned before...so thats very good news...I'm hoping for just Evanston...great location for me at least... Well I'm out for a while...with Emily and Christina...hmm..then dance at 6:30 till 9:30...Oh and brianna if you're reading this..hip hop is today if you wanna come...its fun haha its the 8:30 to 9:30 one..which is a great alternative to sitting at home unless you've found something awesome that's goin on tonight..which in that case I will be quite sad...ah out call the cell..we will talk..oh and amy... i want banana wontons

      I heard that you were home again But you don't look like you're back to me With your focuses changing Your gaze is transfixed on a point that I can't often see You've got your new ties, I've got my old knots You've got your inside line But you're never happy with what you've got  Careful now, you're so beautiful When you've convinced yourself The no one else is quite as beautiful  I heard that you were living well But you don't look like you're living to me Though the sparkle is gone, your smile is in place So that everyone watching will see You've got them all convinced But I know so well that you could list your friends But you can't count on them  Hold it now, you've got everyone convinced That you're alright when no one else is quite as vulnerable  As soon as you've got it you want something else It's not the sale that you love, it's the sell I's not the price that's gonna cost you It's just the weight that's gonna bring you down

      Am I the one being confusing...Who's confusing who? I don't understand......i just don't get it...you can't have everything you want...If you want me...ask for me...if you don't want me...you can't still have me without all the thing you dislike...the good comes with the bad...the bad with the good...now to follow this advice myself...confusing times

      10. That actor who played the President was totally unconvincing   9. It oversimplified the way I stole the election  8. Too many of them fancy college-boy words  7. If Michael Moore had waited a few months, he could have included the part where I get him deported  6. Didn't have one of them hilarious monkeys who smoke cigarettes and gives people the finger  5. Of all Michael Moore's accusations, only 97% are true  4. Not sure - - I passed out after a piece of popcorn lodged in my windpipe  3. Where the hell was Spider-man?  2. Couldn't hear most of the movie over Cheney's foul mouth  1. I thought this was supposed to be about dodgeball
