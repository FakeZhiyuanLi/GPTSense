       Deserted By Others     &nbsp;  " And though after my skin worms detstroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God."     "All my intimate friends detest me;    those I love have turned against me.    I am nothing but skin and bones;    I have escaped with only the skin of my teeth.     &nbsp;   "Have pity on me, my friends, have pity,    for the hand of God has struck me.    Why do you pursue me as God does?    WIll you never get enough of my flesh?     &nbsp;   "Oh, that my words were recorded,    that they were written on a scroll,    that they were inscribed with an iron tool on lead,    or engraved rock forever!     &nbsp;   "I know that my Redeemer lives,    and that in the end he will stand upon the earth    And after my skin has been destroyed,    yet in my flesh I will see God;    I myself will see him    with my own eyes -- I, and not another.    How my heart yearns within me!"     &nbsp;   ~Job 19:13-27      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;     In the midst of intense suffering, Job was convinced that he had been deserted by friends and family. Though miserable lonely, his faith in God was greater than his knowledge of eternity. Believing in the sovereignity and justice of God, Job expressed the hope that God ultimately would prove his case and declare him innocent of charges made against him.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you been caught up in circumstances in which you felt completely alone? Maybe in a way where you were falsely accused, misunderstood, or just ignored? If you are with the Lord, He will be with you always. God will not desert you. We may not understand why God puts us through these hardships, but do not be angry at God or life. Your faith will be strengthened as we look to Him to see us through. We know God's justice will prevail in His own time.    &nbsp;   Thank You, Lord, for inviting me to bring my burdens to You and for never abandoning me.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

        ~~Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the desert, where for forty days he was tempted by the devil.&nbsp; He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them he was hungry.    ~The devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread."
