      So my ambitious and brazen attempt at being a writer will remain just that-- an attempt. I don't think I can embark on a full-time career as a novelist, as I am vehemently hating writing and everyone in the craft. It just seems that writers are forever in this "creative funk" to immerse themselves in depression and darkness, all in the name of the "art."  Writing is so taxing for me. It's draining, it doesn't come naturally as it should, and it's discouraging to ask for feedback from others to be summarily deflated and insulted.  I should note that I myself have never had formal training as a writer. Not many have, I suppose. There are residents here who have been through the Iowa Workshop, people who've had volumes of their work published. English is also my second of three languages, so there is some excuse as to why it is such a laborious effort.  The problem I hold with writing is the lack of glamor. Yes, there are publishing parties and book promotions-- but this happens  after  you've achieved some modicum of success. What is writing? Where do writers write? At their desks, at home, on their computer. Alone, where there is no glitz and no excitement. And out of the millions of writers who do become published-- how many of them achieve fame?  A very miniscule percentage.  I want to be in the spotlight, where some of the attention I crave can be had. Sitting around in my pajama pants, hair in a ponytail, stroking my keyboard--  this is not how I want to spend the better part of my days.  I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up.  Oh, god. This is how people become losers, isn't it?  Adrift and aimless.

      What is life, but an accrual of experiences you're forced to remember? It doesn't seem fair to me, that I have no say in what I choose to retain in my head.  I've come to realize that I don't entirely not enjoy being unhappy. Why? It rather... gives me an excuse to act however I want. I can be callous and selfish and justify it through my "illness"-- which is akin to a fat man slathering his face triumphantly in butter and declaring victory.  I perpetually wait for that one moment-- that one clicking, all-seas-aparting, tangentially omniscent moment-- to come along, fix myself, and fix my life. I search, mainly, for this moment in forms of men.  What I don't want this turn into is a "why am I so unhappy-- I've got the creme filling but I'm still not a Twinkie" bit. For everyone I've hated and re-hated over the years, nothing compares to the level of hatred I have for myself. Ultimately, I lack that crucial part essential for survival called self-worth.

      Arrrrgh. There's something that I lack as a woman, and I cannot figure out what it is.  My efforts to win Poe over today, at the mall, was... fruitless. He was cordial, he was nice, but he treated me with as much affection as he treated the Orange Julius worker who handed him his drink.  "Poe, Do you need a Sylvia to your Ted?"  [snort, followed by staccato laughter]  "First, you're not a poet."  "So? I'm a writer. That's close enough."  "Ah.. well, see, I don't enjoy being bitten. So the Ted analogy fails as well."  The whole afternoon consisted of me making passes at him, and him dodging them. Then, out of sheer desperation, I told him I needed some new lingerie-- did he want to help me pick one out?  He demurred.  He also flinched when I tried to hold his hand, put my hand in his pocket, and when I told him I wanted to screw his brains out, as we were eating at the food court:  "I think this is the part where I'm supposed to be flattered and honoured... but you just make me.... uneasy. You have about as much subtlety as a head-on-collison."  "Poe. I don't understand. Don't you think I'm pretty?"  "I won't say no."  "Then what is it? Why don't you want to be with me?"  "Same reason I don't like ice cream."  "Which is?"  "I'm just different."  I'm seriously running out of ideas. If he doesn't relent soon, I may be forced to break into his room at dusk and rape him until he comes to his senses.  Goddamnit, I wish Poe had Asian fetish.

      I've always thought the best time to get to a man is when he's not awake.  "Good  night , Zelda. See you anon."  He pulled the covers over himself.

      There was a guy, when I was sixteen, who promised me the world and everything in it. He was six years older than I, drove a Mustang, and smoked menthol cigarettes by holding them with his thumb and forefinger. He was my first kiss, my first date, my first  everything.  After he lured me into bed, however, he told me he was leaving the country for a consulting job and never called me.  Strangest thing, though-- this guy, who was supposed to be in Hong Kong for his Big and Important Job?--I ran into him at a downtown bar two weeks later.  His name was Charlie.  Not incidentally, hurricane Charlie is heading straight for Tampa Bay, Florida-- where my parents, brother, and childhood friends reside.  "Charlie"-- synonymous with death, destruction, and all things asshole.

       Knock. Knockknockknockknock. Knockknockknock.     "Zelda." I couldn't read the look on his face when he saw me. He kept the door half closed.  "Poe, please don't close the door. I need to talk to you."  He stepped away and gestured cautiously for me to come in.  "Your face looks... puffy." He narrowed his eyes, then offered me a tissue.  "That's because I've been crying my eyes out."  "I'm sorry to hear that." He sat down on his bed, then motioned for me to follow suit.  "I'm not a lachrymal person, you know." I sat next to him, but didn't cross my legs.  "If you say so."  "Poe... what you said before. About me playing games and trying to beguile. That... that was uncalled for and hurtful."  "I'm sorry your feelings were hurt." My eyes were locked on his.  "Why are you so passive aggressive? You don't say 'I'm sorry' but you say 'I'm sorry your feelings were hurt.' I just need to know what it is I've done to deserve such deploration."  "Look... Zelda. I don't even know you. I probably said those things in haste."  "I'd still like to know why you hate me." One of my straps on my tank top grazed my shoulder. I let it.  "You were... just hitting on me. I don't know. You were coming on pretty strong. But I don't hate you." He didn't touch the strap. He didn't even look at it.  "Are you gay, Poe? Are you a homo... sexual?"  Poe's eyes finally crinkled. Then stifled laughter.  "So let me get this straight. Just because I don't fall for you... that would have you assuming that I am gay?"  "Or are you straight but you just think I'm ugly. That's it, isn't it. You just think I'm hideous."  He laughed again.  "My god, are you ever insecure."  He pulled my strap up and touched my arm in good nature.  "I'm sorry. OK? Maybe I was a bit harsh. It's just that... I sort of know about you. I saw you before, when you were fawning over Ess. I heard stuff."  "Oh." I didn't have anything to say in my defense. He had me there.  He took a sip of his water. He started to chew on his lower lip. God, he looked so pouty.  "Poe, I'm sorry if I scared you. I'm so...  lonely  here. I don't have any friends. And... I don't know. I just wanted to get to know you better. That's honest, and that's the truth."  "Funny how you have to qualify your truth."  We both looked at each other and laughed. Semi-comfortable silence.  "Pity or charity?" I asked, my hand on the doorknob.  "Neither."  "And you're not gay?"  "That's the bit of me you have to find out, I suppose."  Victorious.

      I've decided that Poe is 1) gay 2) blind 3) gay and blind.  "Why do you think they want to house and feed you and give you all the luxuries they could be giving to the homeless? You're here to write. Not to play these sordid games to see who you can beguile."  "Why are you being so mean to me? I just want to be your friend."  "I'm not being 'mean'. I'm just evading your advances and saying 'no', though that's a clear first for you."  He then tossed a book of stamps onto my desk. "Here. Now you can write letters to Nepal."  Great. I guess this is what happens when you throughly emit desperation on hour's intervals.  Why? Why won't stupid Poe just love me back?  This is probably just rejection talking, but I think I hate Poe.

       I don't know what I've done, but I've just left the following note on Poe's door:       Dear Poe,   Thanks for the game of pool last night. I feel, for reciprocity's sake, that I should invite you for a game of foosball tonight in the game room. Do poets play foosball? Or is that outside of the image of cool? If it is, I should hope you will make a valiant exception for me.  Do you enjoy Phillip Larkin? I've a poem that I'm very fond of right now-- "Spirit Wooed"-- perhaps we can commiserate and you can bestow your brilliance upon an ignorant, struggling fiction writer who wants to befriend a stoic poet.  Oh, and I'm also in some desperate need for some stamps. Have you got a few to spare?  Fondly,  Zelda

      Forget minor essayists. The real men of this world are poets.  There's one residing in the colony who doesn't even know I'm alive. I did notice him during my previous stay-- he likes to play billards by himself-- always, always by himself-- and he doesn't appear to be interested in anything other than himself and his poems.  Sitting in the game room, eating a sandwich, I was brooding over Ess last night, and it occured to me that poet-- let's call him Poe-- was not unattractive at all. He was chalking up his cue and seemed to be engrossed in his precious game of pool.  "Do you mind if I play?" I was fully expecting him to chalk up another cue for me.  "I'll be done in half an hour. You can come back then."  "Uh... so I meant, do you mind if I play with you. Would you be very furious if I joined in?"  "Help yourself."  He seemed to perk up a little as the game went on-- and luckily, I was having myself some sportsmanship and skill, and actually put out a good game. He seemed... not unimpressed.  "So... um... you didn't ask me what my name is, or what I'm working on." I, of course, knew everything about him, because I make it so that everyone else's business is my own.  "I know I didn't. I already know who you are. The imminent scientist of the colony."  This made me laugh.  "Oh, hardly. And you, Poe? You write some great poems, or so I hear. Tell me something. Do they rhyme?"  "Only if you want them to."  I asked him if he would be interested in seeing my room. He demurred. I asked him if I could see his room, then.  "You should probably understand that I am a poet. And nothing else."  "Yes, that did occur to me. You did say you were a poet of sorts."  "I say this because I'm not interested in a relationship or dating or whatever it is you're seeking. I just want to write my poems, think about my poems, and everything else is just a distraction."  "Liar. You do forget you're the cuemaster, too."  "Good night, Zelda."  "Let's have lunch together tomorrow by the lake, Poe. Maybe inspiration will strike."  "Nice game. Good night."   There's nothing hotter than a guy who plays hard to get. Except, maybe, poets that play hard to get.

      People-watching is one of my favorite pasttimes. One thing that's always fascinated and perplexed me is the proverbial sight of a not-so-attractive-woman and a less-than-attractive man in fits of loserdom, engaging in affection, hands held, laughter shared, and in that utter place of bliss where no one else and nothing else matter. Owners of mullets and high body fat percentages, people who know nothing about couture or higher education. I look at people like that and think,  "My god. Why are you so happy? What have you got to be smiling about?"     Then I realize those people have self confidence, something that I'm perpetually striving to attain.  Those people who live in trailer parks and eating Cheese-Whiz* and having babies at 16?  They're content. They're satisfied.

      Hah!  I've gone and joined  urlLink http://www.thesquare.com  .  This reeks of blatant elitisism, but what the hey. No need to pussyfoot around with Ivy Leaguers.  Watch out, my friends. I think  urlLink http://www.rightstuffdating.com  is next.  (update: Um, so no. I think RSD is a little too haughty, even for me. Why do they think they can charge for "biographies"?? Geez, just because we're smart doesn't mean we're rich.)

      So I've decided I'm going to pull a Tom Cruise and get some glistening metal wires fastened onto the sufaces of my teeth. I might as get it out of the way right now, while I'm not getting laid and I don't have to subject anyone to the monstrocity. I kept seeing these ads for what was called "Invisalign," whereby no one is the wiser that you have braces because they are made of some super secret invisible plastic stuff. Upon further reflection, I realized that Invisalign is code for "We think you are a dope and want to screw you over."  Invisalign costs about twice as much as the regular metal ones. But the trick to Invisalign lies in the insecurity of the orthodontically challenged. If you don't want to risk derision, ridicule, or ostracization from your more dentally fortunate friends, then, well, you've got to spend the big bucks!  Um... yeah. Plus, they take longer to work. No way am I bending over for those Invisalign motherfuckers. I'm getting the metal ones, not have sex for 9 months, and emerge from the experience a mentally stronger, physically attractive version of myself.  Because these chastity braces are just what I need. It'll do me some good.

      Yes, that would be Koko the gorilla.  The chimpanzee?  I thought she was dead.  But apparently, her ex-boyfriend Michael was the one who expired a few years ago.   Koko is still very much alive, and she is so adept at sign language that she was able to tell her trainers that she was experiencing acute tooth pain.  Yay, Koko is smart and she gets a lot of press coverage.  She also has an AOL account, from what I hear.  Oh, and did I mention that Koko has a boyfriend?  They've been together for like 4 years or something.  Why Koko the ape is capable of maintaining a loving, long-term relationship, and I'm not is the question that makes me want to stuff my face with ice cream right about now.  But of course, gorging on ice cream will only lead to me LOOKING like Koko, which won't make me feel better about myself in an egotistial sort of way.  I guess what I'm trying to say is, I wish Ess would call.

      Last night, I had a dream that Pablo and I were on our honeymoon. He was trying to teach me how to swim, threatening to toss me into the water in jest. It was so beautiful and tremendous and I could swear that I felt the sun shining on me as we played like that. I woke up smiling, because our time in Malta was the happiest I had ever been. I stood by my window, watching the trees sway, while I smoked a cigarette. Then I went back to bed trying to re-dream that dream. I couldn't get it back, and the aftertaste of bliss only made me nostalgic and long.  I've only been in Baltimore for five days, but already, my wits are fraying. My routine is mundane: wake up, drink coffee, go to lab, come home, eat dinner, and go to sleep. It's as if I'm on auto-pilot now, because I don't need to be fully conscious to be doing what I am doing. I don't let myself call Steve or Pablo, because I am sincerely, honestly trying so very hard to stay away from both of them. People in my lab and in my department have stopped asking me to socialize, as their invitations are invaribly met with, "Thanks, but I think I'm just going to go home and read." And that's what I've been doing: Reading. Alone. At home.  I'm sure Pablo doesn't know what my life here is like. He probably thinks I paint the town red with Steve every night, our heads tossed back in fits of laughter and delight in his shiny convertible. Little does he realize that the only things that greet me when I come home every night is a pile of dirty laundry and an empty answering machine. I can't be sure, but I do believe Pablo would be so proud of me if I told him about my newfound discipline and restraint.  But it feels fitting and familiar to be busy, somehow. It's only until next May, and I have a monthlong break from December to January to recoup, and already, I'm planning my winter break, perhaps to Seattle. I've decided that's where I'm most likely to end up after I graduate, because there, the availability of engineering jobs is as high as the literacy rate. Yes, I like to read, and I like to drink coffee, so Seattle and I seem to be a match made in the rain.  Obsession du jour: lucid dreaming. There's a neurological camp that believes you control and you have full say in your dreams. It makes logical sense: it's a manifestation of your subconscious, so why isn't it pervious to manipulation? I'm testing the techniques tonight. If it works, then I could spend eight hours a pretending that I still have what I've always wanted: Someone to hold my hand and lead me float.  Also, if you're trying to lose weight, try being broke. I'm cutting both carbs and fat as I can't afford to eat out anymore, and my pants are nice and loose. Sallow skin and washed-out complexion are added bonuses. It's minimalism at its finest. Yay for forced starvation!

      Today, out of unmitigated anger and in an effort to equate actuality with the truth, I broke Steve's laptop. It was his baby, and he had lent it to me because I was having mine fixed. I'm told the said computer is not fixable, according to the experts at Sony, and it's not covered under warranty either, so the next brave new task is for me to acquire a new laptop. Which isn't such a convenient task to undertake, considering I'm short on boyfriends and incidentally short on cash.  I hate being poor. Being poor sucks. Forget what they say about building character-- I have enough character to last me through destitution ten times over. I just need money.  I've been reading more about Washingtonienne. I can get over the fact that she bedded six men at a time (bravo to Jessica for her fantastic multi-tasking ability), but she only charged $400 per lay! That's not a whole lot, though politicians don't make nearly as much as businessmen (most notably, investment bankers like Pablo) do. And she's not a bad looking chick-- she's got the ambiguous ethnic background thing going for her, and old men dig the exotic label. But $400? Dinner at a posh restaurant plus wine would cost twice as much, more for dessert. Jessica Cutler was a cheap fuck-- and like my mother always said to me-- you get what you pay for, which is why I never buy my mayonnaise at the Dollar Store. Because predictably, now there's talk of her being possibly HIV-positive. Ewww. Lesson of the day: Boys, stick with the high-end call girls. The exorbitant price is worth the clean meat.  Trust me on this.  Amusing incident of the day happened when I was at Donna's coffeeshop on St Paul around 1700. I was sitting at the bar by the window, drinking an Americano and reading Jonathan Franzen's "How to be Alone." The title alone(har, har) probably gave chutzpah to a weird looking man in his 30's with plastic glasses and a chain wallet to plop himself right next to me, whilst there were no less than seven other bar stools he could have graced his (what I imagine to be dirty and pimple-ridden) ass with. Immediately, I deducted points because 1) He was wearing Converse sneakers and in no way was he cool enough to pull off the geek-chicness 2) He was (proudly) holding a Michael Chricton novel. He feigned unwavering interest in his medical thriller, cleared his throat several times, and then, like a real man, he asked me what time it was.  I silently ignored him.  "Oh. So, how's the book? You're so pretty, I bet you really needed that book, huh."  I gave him a blank look and again, repeated my silence.  "So what's the book about? Does it really teach you how to be alone?"  Then genius struck me: The day prior, I had gone to Inner Harbor, where hoardes of panhandlers and beggars fan their creative streak and get quite innovative. I saw a man wearing a sign that said, "Why lie? I want a beer." Moreover, an unfortunate fellow that God had apparently crapped on was handing out little business cards: "I'm deaf and I'm mute. Kindly spare some change, please? Bless you! [hand-drawn smiley face]." I was wearing the same pair of jeans I had worn for the freak show yesterday, so I pulled the said business card out of my pocket and wordlessly handed it to him. I mouthed "thank you" for good measure. Who knew I had a future in miming?  "Oh. Um... It's not much, but it's all I have on me." He gave me a five dollar bill and walked off affectedly, his cheeks turning crimson just like everything else on his face. He probably felt like a dope trying to pick up an apparent deaf/mute woman. Fucker.  I hope he was mortified and sufficiently traumatized.  This is the first time in my life I've actually made money from a man hitting on me. FIVE bucks! That's better than free money on the sidewalk, because I didn't even have to bend over to pick it up! That ought teach him to never accost a woman drinking her beverage in peace.  Men are stupid.

      Irrational traits that make me dislike people:    Love of cats (and all things feline)   Love of  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  and/or  Angel   Mispronounciation of the word "often"  Acne  Goatees and various derivates of facial topiary on men  Mustaches on women  Wearing cowboy boots [unless you work at a dude ranch or live in TX]  Ownership of a dreamcatcher [*actual Native Americans excluded]   Now add my intolerance for stupidity and you can see why I hate 98% of the general population.  I'm getting restless again, and that can only mean one thing: I'm fresh out of a man to obsess over. I think I was excited about Poe for the sake of getting excited than anything else. I have to go back to Baltimore tomorrow, back to lab, back to drudgery... and I'm already contemplating ways to go kill myself, because I. hate. H0pkins.   It would be so much more bearable if I attended a school where my male counterparts were basally attractive. I remember when I visited my friend who was in a program at Georgetown-- wow. There, people on campus actually look like they care about their appearance. Not only that, the school of Foreign Service students are just yummy-- future diplomats and civil servants, a good portion of them trilingual or quadlingual(is that a word?)... Plus so many of them are greedy and power-hungry and elitist, which just SCREAMS sexy.   I repeat: Yum.   I did receive an email from Steve today with Subject: Hope you're OK. And the contents:                                   That was it. That was the entire email. Because there was no text. Just "Hope you're OK" in the subject line. He didn't even bother to copy it into the email. Fucker.   The email means 1) He's getting horny again 2) There's no one around to abate the said horniness 3) He eventually wants his stuff (laptop and "Lawrence of Arabia" DVD) back.  Whatever.   Also, I hate Ashlee* Simpson*. Her stupid song is playing EVERYWHERE. I wish she'd just get a nose job and shut up. In that order.

      Quite possibly, what's funner than drunkenness is its sexier cousin, the act of acting more drunk than you really are.  Yes, so Fun and Funner. Last night.  I was in my room, and the bottle of Maker's Mark perched atop my nightstand invited, no--  begged me  actually-- as did my boredom-- to show them a good time. I poured myself a single glass, then eventually, unbeknownest to me, I was at that place of "Ah, hell, I might as finish the whole thing" and the memories of rejection had somewhere else to be. The proverbial lowering of inhibitions sufficiently upped my ready supply of not-so-scant moxie, so I believe myself to have knocked on Poe's door to tell him that this was his last chance, because I was leaving in two days, and after that, who knew when he was going to see me again, if ever?  My freakish knack for recalling dialogue verbatim was undoubtedly impaired at this point, as the alcohol had truly, sincerely caught up with my act of drunkenness to the point of unfeigned inebriation. I found myself in Poe's arms, and I don't know if it was preceding or following this long-awaited feat, but I complained that the room was too warm and took off my tank top. (Stop the snickering-- triteness and efficacy are highly correlated, I'll have you know.) I forced my lips on his, wriggled my tongue around like a seizure-ridden python, and pretty soon, Poe was asking me if I was wearing Chanel No 5 on the back of my neck, underneath the hair I had so strategically washed two days before.  The theme of last night was FUN, and that's as far as it'll get between us, though I do wonder how far FUN can take two virile adults grouped together only by default, as the pool of attractive people amongst a group called writers is a rather poor one? And I'm also left to speculate as to the cruelty that God doles out to males known as Small Penis, and why He insists on pairing Small Penis and Creative Genius as a winning team, as he had so illustriously done with Ess.  Because it's not. A winning team, that is. They come in last place every time.  In case you can't tell, I am in high spirits, or spirits about as high they can get weighed down by a merciless hangover and an inevitable grievance of the pedestal I had so lovingly placed Poe upon. Because after last night, he is nothing more than Poor Horny Bastard who lost out in the Lottery of Manhood. It's a good thing he's supposed to be very brilliant and poetically promising, because if he wasn't, that would just be another tired example of how some people just can't catch a break.  Note to self: add "poets" to the list of "No, thanks. None for me."

      I try to think of myself as a fairly decent person. As much as I hate kittens, I don't stomp on them in my spare time. And I almost never laugh outright to a person's face. The first hard and fast rule of life, I think, is not to harm others. So imagine my surprise when a male friend I've considered to be a close confidante told me I was "cruel, sadistic, and evil." All because I told him I wasn't burning with animal desire for him.  I don't make friends easily, and the friends I do have, fall under two camps: 1) Those who have had sex with me 2) Those who yearn to have sex with me. Sexual tension is a constant variable in my friendships, which is why, to this day, I am glad Pablo and I didn't have a "real" wedding because my side of the guest list would have bordered on empty. Bridesmaids? I would have had to pay someone to stand in as a loving female friend, because I, don't, have, any. Sure, I have some acquaintances I can always rely on to throw me a hearty invite to an orgy at St Tropez or a shopping extravaganza at Barneys. But none of this soul-to-soul, planets aligning and birds singing altogether- kind of special friendship. I've never had that.  I do remember in the fifth grade, when a girl named Beth graciously and selflessly shared her cranberry juicebox with me. I repaid her kindness by sleeping with her boyfriend twelve years later. A girl on my cheering squad when I was a first year used to give me rides to school every day until I got my own car-- and I ended coaxing her boyfriend to leave her for me just for kicks.  I'll stop here to let the projectories of tomatoes and garbage run their course.  And I wonder why girls hate me and men want to use me.  But see, my confessions here have a point-- which is to say that I am not the person I used to be. I've since made it my policy never to bed a taken man ever again, and I haven't tried to steal anyone's boyfriend since... well, since I learned of karmic justice, which has been at least two years ago. (Please preclude Ess from this said policy. I have a weakness for writers.) I'm not really mean to anyone unless they try to screw me or screw me over-- so why can't people just see that I'm alive and trying to survive, just like the rest of this world?  Underneath this formidable exterior, I'll have you know, lie heaps and heaps of vulnerability.  Don't you see that?

      We're coming back from a Bach concerto. It's raining and he picks me up, as I laugh and feign protest. Standing in wet shoes, wet clothes, he kisses me and tells me he loves me for the first time, again. And suddenly, the clouds part and sunshine hits us from all angles, and Pablo and I are transported to our flat in London and we're in bed.   Ring. Ring. Ring.  Pause.  Ring. Ring. Ring.     "lo."  "Zelda?"  "Pablo? Pablo, is that you?" The intersection of dream and reality, coupled with my sleepiness, makes everything surreal.  "Yes, it's me. Are you... drunk? Where are you?"  "No. No, I'm fine. I'm fine and I'm at home. In bed. Alone." The grogginess dissipating, I force myself to sound more awake.  "I see. So... how are you? How's school?"  "I'm well. School hasn't started yet. Classes start next week. I'm going into lab everyday, though."  Covering my mouth as I yawn, I ask him about work.  "It's going well enough, I suppose."  Then silence. But for the first time, not a thread of comfort anywhere.  "Zelda. I called because I want to make sure this is what you want. You really want to go through with this?"  My head and heart throb mercilessly. I want to scream "NO." NoNoNoNoNoNo a thousand times.  "I think it's for the best.  I don't want to be bad foryou anymore."  He didn't call to discuss him, he says. This is about you, Zelda.  It's always been about you.  "It's so strange that you called, Pablo. I dreamt of you the past two nights. Remember that time when we were coming back from the Kennedy Center, and it rained, and you carried me to the car? We were there again."  "How could I forget?"  "And the night before, I dreamt that we were in Malta together. We were so happy there."  "Yes."  "Anyway, it's weird that you called when I was dreaming about you."  "Zelda, I dream about you every night."  What are we doing? What  is  this? I love him and he loves me, why can't we be together?  "So? Zelda? If you want me to sign the papers and proceed, I'll do it. But I just want to make sure this  is  what you want. It is, isn't it?"  I'm holding myself hostage, it seems. Why can't he see that?  "Pablo. As I've said, I do think this is for the best."  "That's all I needed to hear." His voice is softer now.  Awash in panic, I stumble for words, grabbing for anything to see what would stick.  "I'm terrible and miserable without you, Pepe. I love you, I miss you, and I'm sorry for everything that's happened. I'm so messed up right now, Pepe-- and I'd do anything ANYTHING to have everything the way it used to be--"   If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. For assistance, press 0.     I am talking to no one on the other line.  I don't know when he hung up. I don't know how much of what I said he'd heard.  I throw the receiver down.  I want to wake up.  I start to dial Pablo's number, but I can't bring myself to dial past the country code.  I remain frozen, because this  is  for the best.  I want to wake up.
