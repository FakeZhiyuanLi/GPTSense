        I have recieved the highest honor a blogger could ask for:  recognition by another blogger via a link to my blog on theirs.  Friend, reader, and fellow blogger: I THANK YOU.     I tried responding in kind, but I don't know how to add a links portion to my blog yet.  As soon as I do, I'll list all the blogs I enjoy plus some other cool stuff.   oh, and there's one who is not ready for her blog to become quite so public, so I won't link it here until she gives me the OK.   YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE!     Rain, rain, rain again today.  I like rain, had to work in it all morning and was soaked to my skivvies by 10 am, but kept my spirits up by singing the saturday night bath song ("splish splash, I was takin' a bath....") and by realizing there wasn't a thing I could do about it until we finished and I had time to change.     And big news!   Our first chick has pipped!  It's to be delivered to its new parents this afternoon, since the hatcher is just a machine and doesn't make for very good parenting.  Several of our future chicks will be hand-reared, but we're all very excited, and I'm sure Berta and Ernie, one of our sandhill pairs and soon-to-be-parents, will do a bang-up job.  It'll help that it's not their first time.  I may explain more about how we go about hatching and raising chicks later, but I don't want to post too much work-related stuff in order to protect myself, my co-workers, and the Foundation.  I don't think I've said anything yet that one couldn't find out by visiting and taking a tour, but just in case.    SO....back to Freud and Lewis.  Despite copious note taking, I really can't do  The Question Of God  justice here without much longer entries and time commitments that I can't make at present, so if anything I've said interests you I urge you to read it for yourself.  On the question of conscience and the idea of a universal moral law (i.e. Natural Law, Tao, First Principles of Practical Reason, Traditional Morality, a sense of right and wrong, etc.) Freud claimed morals came from internalized rules that parents instilled, and that guilt is inherited from our primordal ancestors who killed their "totem-father"-the dominant male who controlled each people group-a theory he quickly rescinded on after publishing it.  He further stated that the scientific method is the sole road to fact-finding, and that if people were simply educated and taught that acting morally (not killing, stealing, etc.) is in their best interest, they will act accordingly (this was before the very educated Nazis tried to kill off Freud and other Jews).  He believed equating morals with religion was dangerous because as people become educated they throw off religion, and would likewise throw off morals.  However, as with every other spiritually related question addressed so far, Freud waffled continually on the subject and at times disagreed with himself entirely, but refused the alternative.      Lewis countered by stating that science was purely for observation and reporting on how things behave and/or respond, and any attempt to explain how things got the way they are or going beyond that is to make non-scientific philosophical and/or metaphysical assumptions.  He says that every culture throughout time has had the same basic set of morals and many advanced cultures had moral teachings that led them to see how alike they were to each other.  For example, double-crossing those who help you or stealing have never been admired among any people group.  AND, every people group has failed to live up to their standards (this is the clincher Lewis uses for our need of God) Instead, it is only our sensitivity to these basic morals that change.  A society like ours which has been desensitized by things like psychoanalysis that tells us that our morals are simply a function of delusion or evolution will accept degraded morals much easier.     Further, how can we judge something as "right" or "wrong" without a standard to compare it to?  Obviously we all have a sense of what the ideal right and wrong is or how would we know we're messing up?    While Freud said that trying to be good and always messing up will basically lead to depression and helplessness and a greater sense of unfulfilled longing, Lewis said the following:    "Virtue--even attempted virtue--brings light; indulgence brings fog"     Enough on those two for the day.  Next time---Hope vs. Delusion

         My chronic unhappy dreams are back.  I'm reaching the end of my rope with them.  I actually got up a half hour early this morning (VERY unusual for me) just because I knew that if i went back to sleep I'd continue to be plagued by them.  But hey, it's a beautiful day, and the extra time gave me a chance to pray and prepare better for the day, which I screwed up anyway by the end of my morning meeting.  So much for a fab Friday, which is really just Thursday for me since I work Saturdays.  Yeah, are you clear on that now?  Great.  Praise God that I'm a work in progress, and His grace and providence are greater than I!!     Read the chapter about the question of an Intelligent creator with Freud and Lewis--one of the most interesting tenets of Lewis' was that all of our desires are things that can be satisfied (i.e. we hunger because there's food, we have sexual desire because there's sex, and we want to believe in God because there is a God)  Although I'm already a biased reader, my heart goes out to poor Freud, who angrily and defiantly attacked belief in God for the entirety of his life, and in many of his personal letters osciallated and spoke often of God to his friends.  While I've only finished 2 chapters I definitely reccommend this book for the interest value if nothing else.  We can learn so much from history and the magnificent people who fill it.     Now for a dramatic change of topic..... back to love. My most recent and perhaps most poignant lesson in love can be summed up thus:   Just because someone doesn't love you the way you think they ought, doesn't mean they don't love you.   It was a hard lesson for me as I am very much the idealist when it comes to love and want all the soap-opera, falling-over-yourself, I'd-do-anything-for-you sort of romance that's just a load of crap (or that I get from the wrong guy) and people are people and I live in the real world so I should just get over it.  Now I'm either being bitter or logical--I can't decide which, and my opinion will probably change by the end of the day since I'm more of an emotional person than anything else.  Well, romantic love is not currently a part of my life, at least not in the way that is reciprocated, so whatever.  Romance just gets in the way of other cool stuff anyway, like working (hahaha).  And since I don't have a human relationship to tend to, theoretically I can focus more on Christ and doing His work, but I don't necessarily buy that.  I know I know, Paul was a huge fan of singleness if you can stand it, but I wonder if he ever loved someone and then lost them; he must have considered marriage at some point, probably before his conversion if at all.  Maybe he was burned and hated women after that, and that's why he laid the cultural smack down on women speaking in church and wanting them to keep to themselves and only being saved through childbirth and all that.   OK, bottom line:  STOP WATCHING SOAPS OVER MY LUNCH HOUR   peace out friends, know that your Creator is with you today. Oh and P.S. if you haven't noticed, I enabled anyone and everyone to have commenting privileges, although they'll only be viewed by me and edited for content before being posted publicly.

          Great stuff, science.  Got into some wonderful theories with quite convincing evidence for a global flood.  One of particular interest is called the  Hydroplate Theory  which basically argues that there used to be a LOT of water under the crust of the earth.  This water broke through, causing plates--today's continents--to form, huge chunks of earth to spew into the air and space, causing many of the craters and frozen ice we see on the moon and some of the craters on earth, and causing a lot of the water to go so high into the atmosphere that it froze and came back to earth as hail, quickly freezing and preserving animals such as woolly mammoths.  this explains why we find so many of them in perfect condition today, with fresh stomach contents and recently eaten vegetation still in their teeth.     the website is www.creationscience.com in case you believe I'm full of bunk and would like to check it out for yourself.  I didn't get to the part about what caused all that water to break through, so if anyone gets to it before I do, let me know.    Have gotten through the first chapter of  The Question of God , which is only the biographies of Lewis and Freud, but still fascinating nonetheless.  Turns out they led similar lives in terms of family and events and education even though Lewis lived a generation after Freud.  I'll continue my updates as I have time to read.  After all, the weather is getting nicer and there's cookouts to be had, volleyball to play, birds to watch, skincancer to get, etc.    Ok, time to move some cranes!  I'll say more about handling these amazing birds later.  Peace out!

      So I was perusing the list of other recently published blogs last night (this is crazy, I'm getting so addicted) and realized a couple things.     One (1): these seem to be incredibly popular. Why?  I think it's the venue blogs present to whine, blow off steam, be righteously indignant (or just plain old indignant) voice your opinions, and not have to get in a debate about it if you don't want to.  In an age where some claim people are completely cut off from each other because of tv and the internet and automatic garage door openers, people ARE obviously trying to connect to something.  We WANT to be heard, to have a voice, have people read their blogs, and many DO want to debate things and find Truth (and no, that's NOT in the relative sense, although many seem to think there's more than one Truth).    Two (2): My blog is pretty much the same as everyone else's.  While I'll be the first to admit that I'm basically a regular Jane Doe when it comes to the overall populus I desire to be unique as well.  Yes, I completely feel unique and special as one of God'd creations, there's only one me, etc etc etc.  And even though I'm using blogging as a way to hopefully connect to others and get myself heard I'm still timid about letting people comment and truly putting myself out there.  In my inveterate need to be accepted I somehow think that by shutting out others I won't have to deal with the risk of having my thoughts and opinions (and therefore somehow, myself) rejected.  Again comes the question "what is different about my life and my posts that invite readers?"  As with any good piece of writing, it must be directed at an audience.  But I believe it doesn't have to please them or agree with them or even persuade them.  The purpose should be to engage an audience and keep them reading, wether they hate what you've written or love it or don't care, they should feel compelled to keep reading.  THAT, my friends, is good writing.    On the other hand, maybe blogs are just a smaller version of reality tv.  No one's life is really that incredible on those shows, but we all watch just the same and get sucked into the producers' dramatization of the truth (and if you don't believe me, read last week's edition of People magazine--of course the truth about everyone).  While what I publish here is the plain old truth and is interesting to me anyway if no one else, I bet someone will read it just for kicks, just like I clicked on some random person's blog last night and read through it just to see what their life was like.  If other people do that with me, maybe I need do nothing further to be unique than simply write what I am and feel and experience, and that will be original enough.        Forgive the tangent.  Guess I have more to say than I realized.      So if my Switchfoot CD I ordered last week doesn't come today I'm gonna rail.  I've ordered from them before and everything came fine.   It's  Grassrootsmusic.com   the best way to find any Christian music new and old and on sale and advanced ordering I've found, except for maybe this time.  We'll see.    Hope you all are having blessed, peaceful days.  Can't wait for tommorow's post....

      Ok, so it's not that bad.  I just don't like being treated like I'm incompetent.  At least my fellow interns are in the same situation, and if I tell myself it's for the safety of the birds that makes it better.  Nothing like delusion to lull you into a false sense of complacency, eh?     Stay tuned for my findings on the creation vs. evolution debate.  At the advice of one Elizabeth George, author of  A Woman After God's Own Heart  I am starting my "5 Fat Files" on topics that I will read, research, and learn about and become an expert on, for not only the betterment of myself but as a ministry to give to other people.  She advises sticking to spritiual things so keep my head and focus in the right places, but APOLOGETICS is a huge area, so I'm starting with the whole creation/evolution thing because it interests me and as a scientist I don't feel learned enough about it to defend myself persuasively.  I haven't really started yet, but my plan is to outline a lot of what I find here.    I will eventually enable my readers to comment on my posts, but I'm not ready for the potential repercussions of that.  Be patient with me, and hopefully we'll learn together!     Picked up a book at the library yesterday (yes, I actually found a decent one ON SITE at that dinky library!) called  The Question of God   It's supposedly a purely objective presentation of Freud and C.S. Lewis' conflicting philosophies on God, Death, Sex, the Meaning of Life, etc.  I'll let you know how it reads.  The preface was intriuging anyway.  While I'm already fairly set in my beliefs I want to find out more on both these men and see what they had to say.  Sadly Freud's athiesm stemmed mostly from his problem with that of suffering, an argument even I can rebut.  So we'll see.    Another fascinating albeit long read was Jared Diamond's  Guns, Germs, and Steel .  A VERY thorough work on the histories of human societies, why the Europeans came to America and not the other way around, why Australian Aborigianl tribes still live in huts and hunt even though they've been around longer and have had ample opportunity for advancement, etc etc.  Comes from an evolutionary standpoint but is interesting nonetheless.       If you'd like to learn more about Elizabeth George or her husband Jim and their ministries, check out www.ElizabethGeorge.com or www.JimGeorge.com  They have links to each other's websites of course too.  Enjoy!

       After much debate I have decided to start my own blog and add my two cents-or other monetary valued thoughts-to the public eye.     First, the Disclaimer :    My very discerning sister voiced a criticism of blogging, claiming that honesty likely takes a backseat in these situations and people only post what they want others to see.  I do not wholly disagree with her; I certainly will strive for as much honesty and straightforward-ness as possible in my posts.  However, my desire to be "honest" will not overtake my sense of privacy--indeed, I read just yesterday a friend's blog addressing this very issue.  Therefore, dear readers, understand that certain events, people, thoughts, and emtions concerning parts of my life will NOT be posted here, at least not in a detrimentary light if their identity is included, or in ways that may forego their own privacy.  Should I rescind on this pledge, I give permission to any reader who knows me to confront me and keep me accountable---gossip is an evil thing.      Now, onto other things..... I came across a worthwhile quote by John Dewey (as in the decimal system?)the other day in a book on hatching and raising chickens--further proof that scientists rawk!  I think it may be a good guide to my posts here, just in case they get a little crazy and I go off the deep end:      "It does not pay to tether one's thoughts to the post of usefulness with too short a rope"      So my dad says I ought to write a book.  This immediately begs the question of what experience and knowledge have I to document that would be a good read, assuming I have the talent and/or skill to complete such an endeavor.  What is so interesting about my life that people would want to read about it?  Another question this blog might help solve.  Perhaps I'll put some preliminary stuff in here and pull something together later--so no stealing of my material!    Oh, and just for the record, the book on chickens I was reading wasn't exactly for kicks--I don't intend on doing that any time soon.  I happened to be on "egg watch" for Stella, one of our Whooping Cranes who, along with her mate Woody, has the nasty habit of breaking her eggs.  So we watch them on camera until she pops it out, and then speed over to their pen and grab it.  I was in the middle of a long shift and had taken along the book to get some insight on other egg-research I'm doing for ICF.    I think this about wraps it up for my first post!  Very exciting.  I'd like to put in an entry from my journal I wrote about a year and a half ago and came across last night.  It's about love, so if anyone gets sick to their stomach over that stuff, you definitely should read on---you obviously need it!  I won't claim to have new insight on the subject or say something any better or with less cheesiness than countless others have since love began, but take from it what you will.      Dec. 7, 2002:             So often love is just as painful as it is joyous--all love, not simply the lovers' kind.  It comes always at a cost, though cheaply to some and priceless to others.  I find it difficult to put a value on mine, except to say that even if loving another with any sort of love costs me much loss, pain, and future callous, it gives me more than I could have hoped for and is always, ALWAYS worth it; it is not the fault of Love, who is really only a pawn, it is the fault of those who understand little or naught it's power and greatness, and never consider if their souls have the right to wield it heedlessly.  True that often we scarcely know what we're doing with Love until the boomstick keeps multiplying out of our control, dumping bucket upon bucket of sorrow and drowning us; or, in the case of the lucky who can keep it together and stay afloat, pouring out immense blessing on us and the ones we love.  Real Love can be misused, and I pray for the wisdom, strength, and courage to understand Love, to keep it guarded, not stirring it until it so desires, and always helping others to do the same.  And when it does stir, I pray that I will no longer be apprentice to such supernatural a phenomenon as Love, but fit into the 'magician's hat' naturally.  O God, grant me the ability to do Thy will, even if I've flooded out the castle.

        It is oh-so-nice to know that I'll be missed.  That people love and care about me and would rather I be around than leave.  Strangely enough it is those bittersweet moments in which I feel most empowered to go and least scared.  Likely because I fear abandonment and that people don't care, so when I know they do I feel more supported.  I've already covered leaving people so I won't rehash it all.  Suffice it to say that I hate it and must pull on every reserve of patience I possess (and some I don't) to obey and go and do what I must with a lifted countenance.  Especially when I think things might have been different with some people.  I try not to regret anything.  Obviously there are things I wish I didn't do and things I'd do differently if I had the chance but there's no use to dwell on those as nothing can be done about them but learn and not make the same mistake twice.  It still gets to me sometimes though--wishing I'd said something differently, or said nothing, or spoke up at all.  And I'm an introvert for goodness' sakes!  There are times I avoid my closest friends simply so I won't have to make a social effort!  But here I am, needing people all the same, and wanting my relationships to be deep and whole.  Which is impossible.  Everyone will inevitably let you down and I'll do the same to them.  Social interaction is such a bother at times, but when it's good, it's oh-so-good.        To wait is not to sit with folded hands, but to learn to do what we are told.   urlLink Oswald Chambers

      That's for you--you know who you are.  Do they even have those over there?  I can't imagine anyone besides us silly Americanos would degrade their yards with such tomfoolery, but who knows.  Some countries have nude beaches--we have pink flamingos in our yards.  Or other miscellaneous birds and beasts, dwarfs, and ridiculously huge marbles on even more ridiculous pedastals.  How many people would actually want a flock of smelly, literally bird-brained avids roosting in their yard? Next to cassowaries and vultures, they're pretty much the last ones you could wish for.  But at least the former are among more intelligent avids.  I've been up since 4am along with several of my coworkers, but everyone keeps looking at me like I'm nuts 'cause I've been chipper all day on one cup of coffee while their 3rd an 4th cups wore off hours ago.  Maybe I should arise that early every morning.  I think the crash is coming--my neck and back are killing me.  Definitely a bonus to moving home will be one super sweet mattress.    ...oops, time to do a shift in the chick yard! Back later.  LATER.... Yeah, the crash is coming.  But not before some serious chow and a hot shower.  oh who am I kidding? I'll be up at least til ll, just like every other night.  I have chick-duty later anyway.  Guess I can take advantage of still being 23.  I can still ilk out my youth for another 5 years at least (ha ha ha)  Seriously, 30 isn't even old, as long as I'm married with children by then  *sigh*.     In the meantime, props to Steph, who's the greatest example of a Godly wife and soon-to-be-mother and friend a young woman such as myself could ask for.  Thanks Steph!  She's likely going to need a lot more energy with far less sleep to keep up with a kid.  At least I can leave the cranes and chicks to their own devices when I go home.  That's all I've got in me.  Peace to you all.

        Well well well, got my first sunburn just in time for summer.  The backs of my legs from the middle of my thighs to the middle of my calfs are screaming at me.  I'm pinker than piglet.  That's what you get for getting involved in conversation while trying to get an even tan.  oh well.  Fortunately my aloe is already chilled in the fridge and ready at my disposal. :)    It seems to me that change is often about preparation.  I was watching downy bundles of cottonwoods seeds whirl about in the chick yard the other day, and taking in the prolific and beautiful violet spiderwort flowers that stand out starkly throughout the prairie.  They wilt each night in the evening chill but by the time I wake up the next morning the sun has persuaded them out again.  I thought about the nature of spring.  And then I thought about the nature of fall: my two favorite seasons.  The main goal of every bulb and seed and bud from the months of late february (ok, may in this state) to mid-june is this---grow as fast and big and colorful as you can so you can spread new seeds and reproduce.  True, the generous Lord gave flowers to us for their appeal to the senses, but the flowers don't care about us.  They just want whatever carrier is specific to them, be it bird butterfly or bee, to come and get the goods to carry on somewhere else.  They want whatever animal to eat their seeds or get them stuck in their fur and carry them somewhere new.  And so they spend these few precious months preparing to make new life.  During the fall those plants which have completed their life-cycle die, hopefully having fulfilled their purpose.  Those that are hardy enough to endure make the shocking but beautiful change to dormancy.  From mid-September to nearly the year's end they prepare to survive until the following spring when they can start again.  So perhaps it is this way also with our lives.  Each time a change occurs (a 'spring' or 'fall' as we go along), it is for the purpose of preparing us to survive and hopefully thrive in the coming season.  We have already been equipped with the necessary materials to grow and appeal to a carrier or get our seeds to spread, we need only to make use of them (Hmm, is this why they call it "seeds of change"?)  And when we die, it is in hopes that we have paved the way for new life, or at least made life better for those around us (perhaps flowers serve more purpose than simply appealing to us--they make life better).  In the christian sense we should be reproducing ourselves--not in the traditional procreative way but by "sowing the good seeds" so aptly described in scripture to grow new christians and make their lives better at the same time.  Maybe the seeds of change for us will be the same ones to change someone else. Dude this analogy rawks--and is quickly getting out of control.  So without further musings, I bid thee adieu.

      I've never been the victim of so much road rage as here.  People are so mean!  I don't think I have one little inkling of the evil that goes on in this world and the absolute absence of goodness in people.  And most of the time they don't even know it!  I am too trusting--people will always always disappoint you; even the great philosophers agree that other humans are the main cause of our suffering.  Isn't that sad?  Horrific, actually.  That means   I   am also an inflicter of pain, a potential source of general bad-ness towards others.  Even being aware of it may not dissolve the issue, only lessen it to some degree if I am diligent at it.   I feel like all my life I've been leaving people.  Moving across country, going to college, transferring colleges, leaving college, switching jobs, etc. etc. etc.  While usually experiencing disappointment and sadness, and usually missing some people a great deal and wanting to go back, there was always something behind those emotions driving me, kindof a peace about it, or perhaps just nerves or excitement.  Or perhaps a need to establish oneself again as soon as possible in order to fit in and begin building new relationships even if I didn't really want to.  And they always happened and many turned out swimmingly.   And I rarely left the ones I was closest to in whole.  Yes, I left physically but not emotionally.  I always attempted to maintain the relationship, return emails and make phone calls and plans to visit.  Sometimes we only grew further apart, which is natural to some degree I suppose.  Physical absences can be extremely detrimental and even fatal to the closest of bonds, but what trifle is the hurt of physical separation compared to that of emotional and spiritual??  I have been abandoned by some of my most trusted confidants.  From those who didn't care to others who "feel terrible but think I did the right thing".  How can rejection of one person by another be right in any way? We are all made of the same stuff---the same sort of soul resides in each of us.   I do not mean to say that no relationship should ever be terminated, if one party is abusive or traitorous or has sincerely changed in situation or outlook that no longer allows for a healthy bond.  I do mean to say that at the finish one has no right to simply up and leave if the separation is not mutual.  It is a disgusting thing to leave another without some sort of compensation and by that I mean an understanding of motives and/or reasons.  The parting should leave both on the road to healing and moving on.   Failure to do this is from the most selfish of individuals, the antithesis of love, the ultimate betrayal, present in the most sniveling of cowards.   Even if you do not feel any sort of positive emotion towards this soon-to-be-stranger (another boggling concept--that we can know someone so intimately, and then suddenly not know them at all?!), it is aligned with the lines of the universe that you confront your own thoughts and emotions and FORCE yourself if necessary to communicate.  There is no excuse--not that it is difficult or that they don't want to see you or are angry.  I believe that a good quarter of our suffering would be decreased if we would see beyond our instinctual need to protect ourselves by putting up walls and running away.  We are bound to hurt and be hurt--its inevitable and might as well be faced and made the best of, at least attempting to leave others in a better way than you found them.  Think of the emotional baggage emptied of its cargo--oh how we might then fly!

        As promised, a brief rundown of enneagram #s and my guess as to which Jesus (J) was.  For those of you who've never encountered the  urlLink enneagram , its a personality sorter based on numbers 1-9.  Skeptic you may be, but it is often frighteningly accurate.  Having recived a fresh look on mine last weekend (9 through and through baby!) It got me to thinking.  Now I didn't know J while he was on earth obviously, but I know things about him, and I think maybe I can make a guess as to which number he was.  Really he's the perfect combination of all of them and as someone who never sinned likely had few of the shortcomings of any given number.    1 THE REFORMER The Rational, Idealistic Type: Principled, Purposeful, Self-Controlled, and Perfectionistic       Hmm. a good case. very likely in why he did what he did.  2 THE HELPER The Caring, Interpersonal Type: Generous, Demonstrative, People-Pleasing, and Possessive    Definitely J in his actions.  Saw the best in others and had incredible compassion.  3 THE ACHIEVER The Success-Oriented, Pragmatic Type: Adaptable, Excelling, Driven and Image-Conscious    Er, not so much.  Could be a 3 at the healthiest which is gentle and benevolent and authentic.    4 THE INDIVIDUALIST The Sensitive, Withdrawn Type: Expressive, Dramatic, Self-Absorbed, and Temperamental     Yeah, I'm not seeing it here.  Even at the best which is creative and self-renewing, he still derived his strength from his father.  5 THE INVESTIGATOR The Intense, Cerebral Type: Perceptive, Innovative, Secretive, and Isolated     Doesn't seem to fit, but at their best 5's are visionaries and affect the world by doing things differently.  That certainly fits, but J's motivations don't quite match--I'm gonna say no.  6 THE LOYALIST The Committed, Security-Oriented Type: Engaging, Responsible, Anxious, and Suspicious     At the healthiest 6's become loving and trusted leaders who have rich self-expression.  This could certainly be true for J.  6's also sacrifice for others.  DING DING DING!  do we have a winner?  7 THE ENTHUSIAST The Busy, Fun-Loving Type: Spontaneous, Versatile, Acquisitive, and Scattered    I really don't think so. J was on the ball and had his ducks in a row.  At their best 7's are awed by simple wonders in life and grateful for what they have.  J understood all that and wasn't here necessarily to experience the boundless goodness of life.  8 THE CHALLENGER  The Powerful, Dominating Type: Self-Confident, Decisive, Willful, and Confrontational     May not seem quite right, but at their best 8's  "Become self-restrained and magnanimous, merciful and forbearing, mastering self through their self-surrender to a higher authority. Courageous, willing to put self in serious jeopardy to achieve their vision and have a lasting influence. May achieve true heroism and historical greatness"    hmm.  sounds awfully a lot like J.  9 THE PEACEMAKER The Easygoing, Self-Effacing Type: Receptive, Reassuring, Agreeable, and Complacent     Um, J was not complacent nor agreeable.  At the best, 9's are "Paradoxically, at one with self, and thus able to form more profound relationships. Intensely alive, fully connected to self and others"  True for J, also good at "harmonizing groups, bringing people together: a good mediator, synthesizer, and communicator".   So, J exhibited some great traits from several #'s.  Mainly 1, 2, 6, 8, 9.    Another thing to keep in mind is that each # has a "wing", or also has strong traits from a # on either side.  I am most compelled by the 8 description, and my conclusion today is that J was primarily an 8 with a 9 wing.       Hiked out at Devil's Last night with a few of my housemates.  Perfect night for it and the mosquitoes didn't start attacking en force 'til dusk.  I'm really not looking forward to living in the city again.

      I feel a duty to warn you about The Saz, a restaurant on State St. in Madison.  Granted, its State Street.  I couldn't figure out if it was mexican or greek food---tasted fine, but the establishment overall didn't look that sanitary, despite several awards on the wall for best food/restaurant in Madison, etc.  Just be careful if you don't have a strong g.i. tract.  I do, and it even battled me.  Anyway, what the crap is up with dumb interview questions?  Seriously, here's a sample of how my (2nd) one went yesterday:  (HR interviewer):  Describe a situation in which you did not get along with coworkers, and what you did to resolve it.   (me):  .........fudge fudge fudge   (Operations Manager):  Ok, describe a situation in which you did not fulfill your responsibilities in the workplace.   (me): ..............um, fudge fudge fudge    I should've just told the truth, which is that I get along with everyone and if I don't happen to like someone then I try to be kind to them anyway and avoid conflict, and I work hard and always do my job!!!!  Apparently they liked my made up answers because they unofficially hired me, pending a few other interviews and the checking of my references.  Whoohoo.  My apologies for subpar posting of late.  I have to finish "The Question of God" this week 'cause its due back at the library on Monday.  So you can expect a few more posts on that.  I also just picked up a book about the creation/evolution debate that looks promising, so I'll be exploring that soon as well.  Am I allowed to man-bash on this site?  Well of course I am, its my blog!  Hmm, no, I know several of my male readers who would not apply, so perhaps I'll just go up to the Whooping Crane exhibit and rant to them instead.  Jesus must have been God; if he weren't his silly male-ness would've ruined everything and there's no way he could have not sinned.  I wonder what enneagram # he was.  Is that blasphemous to try to assign God a personality type?     I'm gonna do an enneagram summary next blog and try to figure it out.  In the mean time, let me know what you think, even if its my going straight to hell for considering it.

      Is it me, or does it bother anyone else that the same liberal media newscasters who blasted Reagen during his presidency are now monopolizing the airwaves with their somber respectful eulogies of him, declaring him comparable to Lincoln as one of the greatest presidents?  Just curious.

      I wish this blog would post the oldest entries first so newcomers (should there be any!) could catch up, but I suppose for the faithful reader having the new juicy stuff right there makes sense.  I'm increasingly intruiged by html and formatting, but have not the first clue how to use it.  I will endeavor to better my blog!       Its been raining for 24 hours straight.  I like rain--its one of the best sounds.  But for days before it was hot and humid and anything but comfortable, and the change in weather and being confined to the indoors has everyone in the house tired and restless.  I've been feeling generally upset too--as if the bolus of despair and pain and confusion that has grown in recent months behind my sternum has grown and is threatening to destroy what's left of my rationale and contentment.     I don't think I'll be able to convey everything I wish I could tonight--this dreary fog still burdens my head. But as I dragged myself down here to the basement and forced my heavy fingers to type and just MOVE, I was instantly lightened to find an email from a very dear friend whose every word I hang on, who makes me laugh, who I am lucky and bewildered to still have as a friend, and who somehow, shockingly, has retained a piece of my heart despite our ridiculous and sometimes laughable history.  My life is beginning to change, again, which might not be so bad if I felt like I would like the result and were not finally getting comfortable here.  And just because I don't understand it and I feel like I'm taking a step backwards, like this is just not where I thought I'd be heading, doesn't mean its wrong.  I keep thinking that if the events of my life four months ago (that many already?!) had not taken place, if I'd just been more patient and not so foolish, if I had only found a way to communicate and hang on, then I'd be willing to make the step I think I'm about to make, or not have to make it at all.  And I hate that.  Don't misunderstand, I HAVE forgiven myself and him, and the fault was not wholly mine, although while I blamed him for abandoning me in a time of great need it was  I  who ultimately pulled away.  And moving home to a city I abhor, to have a job I don't REALLY want and to be near people I scarcely know anymore may work in my favor, and I cannot say what God has in mind for me.  I do know that this is only the open door, and I must walk through it.  And once the sun comes out again, I'll probably feel differently.      In reality I have nothing to complain about nor fear.  I have been blessed far beyond any measure I could think of, and so many things have worked out in my favor that I can only stand in awe, blinking back tears of gratitude that such a God as we have would care about  me.    So I must digress to Job, who in all his wisdom said simply this:  "The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away; blessed be the name of the Lord."

        Once again Lewis manages to blow me away--that man was a genius.  Today its the subject line:  He and Freud on the question of happiness.  This chapter was a long one, but I'll try to get it right, especially 'cause I think my housemates are about to begin a rousing game of pit, and what could bring more happiness than that?!    OK, so, the premise is  'what is the source of our greatest enjoyment in life?'  Freud and Lewis both suffered from chronic depression; Freud's lasted his whole life while Lewis overcame his depression after his conversion experience.  Freud believed that happiness was fleeting and nearly impossible to find, actually equated with sexual pleasure that only lasts a short time.  He acknowledged that we can derive some happiness from our work and interests, but this happiness is almost nil compared to what we try to get from love relationships (which ultimately fail or we get old and sick and die) and not everyone is talented so only a few very talented and lucky people can have happiness, and even then for a short time.  Finally Freud calls religious faith simply a reason to delude oneself and believe they can find happiness.      Lewis (my champion by now!) after coming into a relationship with Christ, sees things very differently.  He agrees that happiness is hard to find and the world will always see only death and destruction.  He says the plan of creation did indeed include happiness for us, but our free will which allowed us to choose sin and therefore inflict pain and suffering on each other (the source of 3/4 of our unhappiness) caused the creation plan to go awry.    "The more intelligent and more gifted the person God creates, the greater the capacity to love and to be a positive force in the universe, but also, if that person rebels, the greater capacity to love cause evil...."    Can you imagine how much good Hitler or Saddam could have done, had they chosen GOOD over EVIL?  I had a friend in high school who was basically agnostic.  Great girl, good friend, very intelligent, had high motivations and ambitions for her life.  But she refused to listen as I tried to witness to her (granted, my witnessing style at that point of my life wasn't the most effective).  I always thought that she could do SO MUCH good in the world, so much MORE for herself and the kingdom, if she would just see that God wanted a relationship with her and could provide her with everything she wanted and more than she could possibly imagine.  She claimed that she was fulfilled in many other ways and didn't feel a thing missing from her life, but I wonder if she was so full of worldly things and her own sense of ambition that she mistook that instinctual need of God that everyone has for something else, or simply refused to acknowledge it.  I prayed often that God would soften her heart, and I don't know if He ever did.  She seemed an impossible case, but that of course borders on blasphemy, and I still remember her in my prayers from time to time, hoping that I said something right that stuck with her, something that someone else will see one day and encourage her to seek Christ and ultimately the happiness she swore she'd find on her own....     But back to free will...   "...the happiness which God designs for His higher creatures is the happiness of being freely, voluntarily united to Him and to each other in an ecstasy of love and delight compared with which the most rapturous love betwen a man and woman on this earth is mere milk and water.  And for that they must be free."   c.s. lewis     He goes on to say the primary purpose of our lives is to establish a relationship with Him who put us here.  Until that relationship happens all attempts to obtain happiness will never quite fulfill us.   "...we were made not primarily that we may love God (though we were made for that too) but that God may love us, that we may become objects in which the Divine love may rest 'well pleased.'"    "...God designed the human machine to run on Himself.  He Himself is the fuel our spirits were designed to burn, or the food our spirits were designed to feed on...God cannot give us happiness and peace apart from HIimself, beacuse it is not there.  There is no such thing."  lewis     This is the kicker...   Lewis postulates that although we have a right to pursue happiness, we have no right to it: "This sounds to me as odd as a right to good luck...we depend for a very great deal of our happiness or misery on circumstances outside our control.  A right to happiness doesn't, for me, make much more sense than a right to be six feet tall, or to have a millionarie for your father or to get good weather whenver you want to have a picnic."     How true, Clive, how true!  We have lots of great times here on earth, but if this life really satisfied us, we might mistake it for our permanent home, instead of something we only pass through on our way to be with God.  It might not have happened this way had we not sinned, but it makes sense now that God is going to make a new heaven and a new earth for us someday.  And when we put our relationship with God first, everything else falls into place and is also increased in enjoyment and fulfillment.

         It's amazing that something as precarious as new life should come into being.  How many conditions must be perfect for pregnancy to occur and  work , or for an egg to come under just the right humidity and get turned just enough times to hatch.  Despite many miscarriages and eggs that never hatch, the fact that it happens at all is simply humbling. and now for something almost completely unrelated....        I sat in the Whooping Crane exhibit tonight, basking uncomfortably under the humidity and heat of the fading sun but taken in by what was in front of me.  Imagine if you will a semi-ampitheater, with four long rows of wooden benches and covered for spectators but open and spacious nonetheless. only a railing and cement wall separates you from a pond spanning the length of the ampitheather and likely twice as wide.  The land surrounding the pond rises up almost immediately in a berm perhaps 10 feet high or so, and slopes down behind to blend in the with prairie, broken only by electric fencing.  There is nothing above this enclosure but sky, splashed beautifully with pinks and peachy hues over white clouds piled up on the horizon, and a fading blue sky illuminated to the west by the last streaks of golden sunlight.  The land itself is a panoply of color--a hundred, no, surely more, shades of green bathe the berm right up to the waters' edge and even into the pond itself in the reflection of bulrushes and reeds, tiny sedges and proud cattails, irises and countless other plants reaching up in unison to the sky.  Invisible insects (or fairies surely?) tickle the otherwise undisturbed surface of the pond, leaving tiny circles of wake behind them.  All manner of birds-swallows, red-winged blackbirds, sparrows, swoop by or sit in the reeds and call, and if not by eye than by ear can one distinguish several other calls from the woods beyond this small but magnificent world.  As if this were only the backdrop for one's eyes, the major players, the Whooping cranes themselves, cavort and forage in their personal suite.  One is on the nest of course, a large circular bed of grass and reeds built up above the water line and nestled behind a wall of rushes, so that only a glimmer of gleaming white feathers are visible.  The other mate wades gracefully through the shallow end of the pond, prodding at a clump of grass here, finding some frog or little treat and tossing it into the air, catching it flawlessly and swallowing it whole.  After, a little cock of the head as if to gauge the spectator's response, if it cares that you are watching at all.

        For the first time in my life, I fainted today.  At the worst possible of moments and in front of my boss.  argh.  I'd been feeling under the weather but nothing severe, and all of a sudden things start to go black and I tried to fight my way through it but the next thing I knew I'm waking up on the floor thinking,  I already woke up this morning.  What am I doing on the floor....oh no....   Needless to say I'm fine, at least fine enough to be blogging.  I got the rest of the day off since I scared the kapok out of my boss, and was more embarassed by the whole incident than anything else.  I've been sleeping for most of the day but I think I just caught the flu or something.  I'm feeling weak. Hopefully it's not a brain tumor or something, and by tommorow I'll be back in the game.    SO...where was I with Freud and Lewis?  Oh yes, the question of 'which road to reality', or 'is a conversion experience the real deal or simply "a halucinatory psychosis"'?  Freud believed the latter in most cases, except he greatly admired Paul and had no problem with his conversion experience on the road.  go figure.  Lewis' experience was long and gradual, more of an intellectual and philosophical conversion than an emotional, although it must have been somewhat emotional, according to the author, since everyone (some more than others) are governed somewhat by their feelings.   There wasn't a lot on Freud in this chapter beyond what I've already listed.  However Lewis, who was very well read and especially on myths and legend, came full circle to believing the bible was simply legend to taking it as truth.  One of his very athieistic friends mentioned the solidarity and of the gospels which really threw Lewis for a loop, so he began to study them for himself.  One of the conclusions he arrived at was that the life of Jesus can't be a story because of how little we know about it, and that if someone had crafted the tale they would've put in more detail and drama.  Jesus also made claims that no other religious icon made.  If you had asked Bhudda or Mohammad if they were actually God they would've been apoplectic.  Yet Jesus makes this claim in all seriousness.  The wording used is also indicative of the truth about who Jesus is.  Scripture uses the word "begotten" to describe Jesus as the Son of God.  Were the word "created" used it would've had very different meaning.  Just as what what God begets is God and what man begets is man, what God creates is  NOT  God and what man creates is  NOT  man.  a small word but very important.   The author also goes on to say that many people who have had a conversion experience find their lives more fulfilling, are more productive, happy (the topic of the next chapter), less fearful about death and the worries of life, and these traits can be attested to by others who knew them before and after their conversion.  If what Freud had to say about hallucinary psychosis is true (characterized by non-productiveness and an overall dementia and fearfulness of life) how can so many converts be so well off?

              I probably shouldn't post when I'm going through post-weekend withdrawls.  My effrontry could get out of hand, so consider yourself warned.        Actually I prefer soy-brats.  NO, they DO NOT taste like regular brats, but they do taste good, and have very interesting texture.  YES, I DO eat brats made from real pigs (right, as opposed to fake pigs?) or whatever.  But I'd rather not feel my arteries harden as I stand there stuffing my face, unless its going to be chocolate; and don't even go to this low-carb hype.  Just wanted to set the record straight.  Really if everyone would simply moderate themselves there wouldn't be all this nonsense.  Like I should talk.     So I finally invest in my own set of disc-golf discs, and it rains all weekend *sigh*.  At least I learned how to serve a volleyball overhand.  Needless to say I need more practice.  But I recommend both sports, outside of tennis.  You can't get much cooler than a "ladies and gentlemen's" game turned hard-core.  Except maybe women's rugby, which I've never played and don't intend to.  I have my scruples.     On Definitions....     While attempting to sort out my thoughts and my heart last week, I began considering the difference between  Hope  and  Delusion .  Like when does one blend into the other?  Where's the line?  I'm rather over it at present, but having promised this topic in my last post I'll try not to disappoint any avid reader, should there be such a one besides myself.  We shall begin with a standard dictionary definition (Webster's, I think. I forgot to check.)    HOPE v.: To entertain an expectation for something desired.  To trust or rely, esp. confidently.   DELUSION n.: A deception; a false belief or opinion; a fixed or persistient false mental conception with regard to actual things or matters of fact.     Now that we have something to go on, let's move to an example.  Ok, so I have HOPE that the Switchfoot CD I ordered (see May 26 post) will come.  I trust the company because I've ordered from them before, and have every reason to expect my desire to recieve that CD to be fulfilled.  If the CD doesn't come but I see the charge on my credit card statement, then I will realize that I have DELUSION concerning the matter, and the fact is they never shipped it at all.   So how long does one hope before it becomes delusion?  In the above scenario there's a deadline--the day I recieve the charge but not the goods.  At that time should I continue to expect the CD to come without taking action?  Or confirm my "false mental conception" and call those jerks to politely demand they cough it up?   I suppose delusion always begins as hope, if the hope-er isn't privvy to the facts.  And according to the definition, hope has nothing to do with the facts--it's more a matter of faith.  Oo, here's an idea: since I'm quickly realizing that the hope I had for finishing this well is quickly becoming a matter of delusion, let's open it up to the readers.  Whaddaya think?  Feel free to comment and I'll make this a little open-forum type deal.  I have more to say on this, but I just didn't get enough sleep last night to articulate myself successfully.  Please forgive, and send in your comments.    On Babes in the Halfshell....     I had the very awesome opportunity to watch a sandhill crane ( Grus canadensis ) hatch this afternoon.  It was an assisted hatch because it wasn't in the right position to peck through the shell on its' own, but what began as an egg in my supervisor's hand became a chick as the shell was chipped and peeled away.   Incredible .  It doesn't seem like that big a deal when you think about it or are used to seeing eggs everyday, but watching it happen and  seeing  the chick come out and realizing that a month ago it was a cluster of dividing cells is....well, the miracle of life, to be quite cheesy.  Mentally converting that process to that of mammals and considering my own God-given ability to produce that sort of result (minus the feathers and beak) is tre cool.  I can't promise that I'm keen on being pregnant, but its still frickin' amazing.   On Endings....  Well between the long weekend (including an actual face-to-face real conversation with an ex), and welcoming new life into the world I'm spent.   Ciao.

      No, not all is fair.  I speak as both assailant and assailed.  But no, I'm not going to spend this post on more relationship issues and how ironic my life is.  Several comments have been addressed to me along the lines of skepticsm towards my voluntary removal of myself from the dating scene.  While attention and affection from men is desired and somehow finds me when I am least looking for it, it is rarely lasting.  And I, even I, have a breaking point.  In the interest of self-preservation (STILL feeling somehow selfish for wanting this), I choose singleness.  Besides, it's not like my door is being broken down.  I refuse to consider having a 'boyfriend' until next February.  Deal.  I fear I am in danger of becoming false and manipulative.  I have always strove to avoid this and in recent times feel more aware of myself and my abilities to change, stay the same, or vacillate if I so choose.  It is easier when I have been praying less and not listening as closely: thence comes the fear of my abilites being ones I should not necessarily be using.  Anyway, how about something a bit lighter, shall we?  Sorry, I get in these moods sometimes, and that's always when I feel like writing.  Not uncommon among folks I'd wager, but still, who wants to hear it all the time?  Saw The Village today.  Definitely a Shamalayan film.  Overall Ok--feels just like his other flicks but worth a watch.  Found myself a bit distracted from all the big name actors in it but he always gets the big ones to act for him.  Still very clever, and I SO have a crush on Joaquin Phoenix.  More than Alan Rickman, that sexy Professor Snape!  The job is off to a fairly good start.  Not looking forward to getting up at 5 am when its January and 10 below.  Brrrr, I shiver just thinking about it.  But working 4 10 hour days will agree with me I think and allow me to travel or whatever.  I will miss having Friday nights and Saturdays, but it's a willing sacrifice to find a church.  Anyway these 2 kittens came in the other day that had been victimized by a bunch of stupid boys who were pouring motor oil on them.  MOTOR OIL!!  Fortuantely a woman happened across this scene before any matches could be lit and rescued the poor creatures and brought them to us.  A bath with Dawn (cuts grease!) did the trick and they were much better off with some hot water bottles and blankets and food.  I cannot believe such blatant disregard for life---if you're reading this and chuckling to yourself--SHAME, SHAME on you!  Such behavior is cold-hearted and sick.  If you disagree, I challenge you to justify yourself via the "comments" link at the bottom of this post.    I gotta go--have some catching up to do with an old co-worker I ran into today.  Later--

      Holy Catholicsm Batman!  So I'm driving south on 41 this morning and saw a sign for Holy Hill.  I hadn't been for several years and remembered vague but pleasant memories of it so I took the off-ramp and made my way through the countryside and up to the Hill.  Holy Hill is this huge old cathedral built a couple hundred years ago or so and run by the Carmelites, a group of men somehow related to Mt. Carmel (or more likely just call themselves that because it sounds pious, I didn't read all the signs that carefully).  There was something about being barefoot, but I can't think of the word now....calcered?  No, that's not it, but it was something like that.  Anyway they have 2 chapels and these tall towers which were closed for repairs, but I sat in the upper chapel for a bit, the only one there on this hot sticky August morn.  The whole place is rather elaborate--carvings, statues of Mary at every corner, other various Saints, crosses, paintings, etc.  The upper chapel is the larger one and no less ornate.  I sat there thinking, "Is this what God asks of us?  Is all this fal-de-rah what's expected of us mere humans?  Certainly it cannot be bad to take and create such beautiful houses of worship, but is it necessary?  Many temples and shrines were built to God in the Old Testament, some of those being just piles of rocks!  Why do we need all this just to have a gathering place to come and worship God?      Every culture and god has their own temples and worship houses, some even greater and more awesome than the bastions of Christianity.  Did Christians start building cathedrals and mighty churhes to out-do Bhuddist temples and Muslim shrines?  In that case it would not be what God has asked of us.  That is no way to promote a faith, especially the True one.  I know that some of my readers just cringed when I called Christianity the True faith.  But I cannot call it anything else.  There is one True God, and only by His son can we be saved.  Scripture says it and I see no way around it if you believe the Bible.  The other theological questions just opened up by this paragraph will have to be saved for another time.    Regardless, I enjoyed my visit and the view from the top of the Hill.  It broke up my ride home from Appleton and added a bit of adventure to my day.  Appleton, by the way, was great.  My dear friend is moving to Arizona this week so I took the opportunity to visit her and say goodbye during my long weekend.  The visit was full of surprises too.  Saw another friend I hadn't planned on seeing, did some shopping, got to drive a big powerful suburban, helped out in a camp kitchen and took a walk thru the northern Wisconsin woods.  Now tommorow it's back to work, but hey, only for 4 days and then more weekend!  I love this 3-day weekend stuff.  The sub sandwhich and Ben-n-Jerry's I just ate are doing me in, so its off for a nap, or walk, or something besides sitting in front of my computer.  Ta-ta.

      My blog officially gets the "Most Understated 'Work in Progress'" Award.  I'm now at the library, trying to figure out what the heck is going wrong with the computer at home or my own non-comprehension of why things aren't showing up like I think they should be.&nbsp; I think it's time to just buckle under and fork out the $$ for a laptop of my own.&nbsp; The benefit of being at the library is that I get to update my card and look at books.&nbsp; I do love books so.  Oh, and while I'm here, let me introduce my brother's blog!!&nbsp; It's super.&nbsp; So Tim.&nbsp; I mean, Maxx King (his ever-so-sexy stage name).   urlLink masterpieceinthesand.blogspot.com   enjoy!&nbsp;   I may not be posting again for a while--I have a 4-day weekend and think I'm going to be doing some traveling.&nbsp; If not, don't forget that I love you, no matter who you are, and Jesus does too.&nbsp; Don't roll your eyes.&nbsp; It's not hokey.&nbsp; Ok, it is.&nbsp; But it's true.&nbsp; We all need some hokey factor in our lives.&nbsp; It helps keep us humble I think.&nbsp;&nbsp; None of us are above partaking in hokey crap once in a while.&nbsp;

      I can be so ditzy sometimes. And I usually realize it right away, but it really aggravates me. It's like even if I do try to reason something out I still start speaking or doing and it comes out completely ridiculous. I suppose as long as it doesn't hurt anyone but my own ego then I'm ok....   My apologies for no longer having separated paragraphs. I made a formatting change and the result wasn't what I thought it would be (no, not because of my aforementioned disability this time) and now I can't get it to change back. The formatting bar which usually appears when I'm writing no longer appears either, but I think that's because of this clunky old machine, not my clunky slow brain.   Had a lovely chocolate cooler complete with whipped cream and chocolate shavings this morning from the lovely Caribou Coffee. A perk of no longer living in the sticks. I miss them though. So....stick-y. I'm growing accustomed to city life already, even though it weighs on me. I can usually ignore it, but it's always there. Like I can't breathe as well (not just because of pollution) or that there's something just out of sight that's.....that's....out to get me. Does that make sense? I can't explain it, it's just.....different.   So #1 thing I hate about the city: traffic, except dang if there isn't always some great eye-candy in the lane next to me!  #1 thing I like about living in the city (in a 3-way tie with good food and shopping): hello? didn't I just say eye-candy?  &nbsp;Weee, I get to sign up for class tommorow! I miss school sometimes. Hopefully taking a class for myself without credit or grades will be fun and a useful way to spend 50$.

      Am finding that my stay here may become more interesting than previously imagined.  I am always surprised like that and shouldn't be anymore.  Things always pop up--it makes getting up every morning worth it.   Went for a bike ride today, more for exercise and to escape boredom and the brownies sitting on the counter.  Back behind my house are several large developments that have grown over the past decade or so since my uncle sold the land that used to be my grandparents' farm.  I remember coming out to visit when I was young and the farmhouse my dad grew up in.  I only remember a few things about it, but the land I remember, and this road we now live on that never used to be so busy or so developed.  Several old pine trees--the former boundaries of the farm---still stand, now the middle of a park, or the entrance to a cul-de-sac.  All the houses are huge, each with a fine expensive car in the driveway or 3-car garage.  Benz, Mercedes, Porsche, all manner of SUV; you name it, I saw it today.  And the street names!  Good gravy, who comes up with this crap?!  "Victoria" "Sommerset" "Strattford" "Greenview"  It's the classic American dream suburb subdivision.  Lawns mowed 3x a week, immaculate homes, the kids all wear bike helmets, etc.  Yes, I'm rolling my eyes big time.  Can you tell I'm a little anti-house-with-the-white-picket-fence?  I don't know why.  It just gets to me sometimes.  If I ever do manage to find a good man and convince him to stay with me I'll probably end up in my own little domestic haven.  I guess it's maybe the whole urban sprawl thing.  Yet another situation I find myself despising and unable to avoid being a part of.  Anyway, I went to church this morning too.  A plant recommended by friends and in which I was warmly welcomed.  I may not go back simply because it's a 40 minute drive.  But I enjoyed it.  Another reason I'd like a place closer to home is so that I can be active in that community of believers on more than just Sunday.  How can I impact people in that town if I don't live and work there?  Just showing up once a week may help me, but how am I to serve effectively?     It was also church-y.  After attending small home group church or none at all for the past year I have grown unaccustomed to corporate worship and a real order-of-service.  I found it all rather distracting.  On the social level, there were several men and women there my age, but of course: all married (mark by loud controlled sigh).  I'd like to make some new friends and get involved in a young adults group with some other SINGLE people in it.  I don't have any problems hanging out with non-christians and most of the existing friends I have here are in that category, but some real fellowship would be greatly appreciated.  I'm going to check out some other churches in the area and pray about it, and see where God would have me fit best.  He did do some other speaking to me today though, which was good---God was definitely there this morning.    I decided to take a sign-language class this fall at the local tech college.  I've wanted to do this for a long time and finally have the time and resources.  I'm super excited, and my ultimate hope if I get fluent enough is to volunteer my services for whatever needs there happen to be; church, social events, interpreter, etc.    I finished painting my room--the 2nd color ended up being "lush greenery".  Yeah, kinda like those street names.  But I like the finished product, and now it looks way less like a basement.  Found a decent tomato colored duvet cover for the comforter I had too, so most of my domestic urges have been satisfied for the time being.

      I'm irritated.  Not only does this old computer freeze up at any given moment, I am more limited in how much time I spend online without feeling guilty.  And I seem to have lost one of my toolbars and can't link anything to my posts for the time being.  Apparently my dreams of learning html and formatting my blog to my liking are on hold indefinitely.  Grrrr.  Anyway, I think I whine too much around here, which may be part of what journals are for, but maybe I should just buck up and deal.    In other news, a Chipotle is opening like 5 miles from my house!  Whoohoo!  Now I've got almost instant access to that AND Krispy Kreme.  And I thought moving home was gonna be a drag.  At least I have bragging rights.  And I don't even go to Krispy's--my butt is squishy enough as it is.  http://www.enn.com/news/2004-07-22/s_26088.asp  is a story about a chicken company and the people they fired for chicken abuse.  Don't laugh; this is serious!  Obviously since PETA is involved there's more to the story than what ENN reports, but I hate people who think they can treat animals any way they want.  ESPECIALLY people who think since God gave us "dominion" over animals we have supreme control over them.  That's the biggest crock of egotisical s**t I've ever heard.  If someone gave you a diamond necklace or a new car would you act like it wasn't worth anything?  Would you wear the necklace to play sports in, or never change the oil in that car?  Animals are a gift to us along with the rest of the earth, and we have NO right to use them irresponsibly.  Christians above all should be the example since we're supposed to believe God created it all for us.  Even if it were all a product of billions of years of random chance and mutation, what right do any of us have to harm another living creature?  Don't misunderstand.  I eat meat and I'm not saying we can't kill animals for food.  What I'm saying is that we need to do it humanely, not by cutting the beaks of chickens and herding them into tiny dark spaces to live out the rest of their lives while they await slaughter.  We're above animals, but they're our closest companions, even silly chickens and slugs.  Call me a freak if you want, but why are we so obsessed with them then?  Why do children have an endless fascination with all animals?  Why do we flock to zoos and wildlife parks to catch glimpses of them?  Why are there countless adoption and rescue centers?  Why the double standard?   So I'm attempting to choose paint colors for my little basement hide-a-way.  So far I've got this fun metallic-y purple for the bottom half called "Tiffany Dragonfly".  I know; who comes up with this stuff?  Could I jump on board and actually get paid for something like that?  In any case it'll look cool when it's all said and done.  I was thinking some shade of green for the top, but this is a more daunting task than I imagined and I am in the throes of indecision (NO, NOT because I'm a 9, because this is a big decision!)  I need to get back to work so I'll stop spending money.   Adios, Ciao, Aloha, etc.

      My sincerest apologies for not writing in a while.  My life was in the throes of change and I was not near a computer for a few days.  But now I am moved into my new headquarters for some undetermined amount of time, and have a few minutes to post something.     My last day at the Crane Foundation was Saturday.  I had a wonderful send-off from both staff and interns, who showered me with love and luck and a few free meals and drinks.  I left feeling totally cared for and with possibilites of future relations with them.  Sunday I drove up to Point and spent a couple days having the last fling with them I'll probably get for a while.  I miss them still, more, and with moments of frustration.  Monday night I drove to Appleton and spent the night with another friend there.  We stayed up late talking, did some shopping, baked, watched a movie, and generally got our goodbyes in as she is moving far away soon.  Tuesday night I arrived in Milwaukee, and drove down my street with a variety of feelings.  My party time was by no means over however---I cut loose downtown with my sister and two of her buds.  After being a scrub for the past few days it felt good to pull out some swanky clothes (yes, i acutally own a few items, budget though they may be!) a dangly pair of earrings and some lipstick.  We went first to the Polaris, the rotating restaurant on top of the Hyatt.  Had drinks and split some of their fab desserts.  We headed next for the Velvet Room, a restaurant/martini bar/club a couple blocks away.  Being a Tuesday night it was dead but the music and atmosphere was terrific, and the martinis just right.  Definitely a perfect way to celebrate my move home.    So today I met up with Ell and her friends for brunch at George Webbs (where else?!), then was off to finish preparing to start my new job.  This included a drug test (yes, I passed with flying colors) and buying new clothes to work in (Tough day for me!).  I walked all around one of the nicer malls in the area (I now have 3 or 4 at my disposal) and was just exhausted by the end of it.  The traffic, people, sales, buy buy buy---I'm not used to it anymore and find it rather undesirable.  I can see myself enjoying the proximity to shopping when the mood strikes but fashion and clothes have never been my forte and investing money into those things is difficult for me, despite my 18 or 19 pairs of shoes and a closet full of clothes.  The rest of my week off will be trying make my room in the basement my home, catching up with a couple old friends and definitely some serious time in prayer.  I have not spent any quality time with the guy upstairs in a while and I'm missing it bigtime.  FYI:  the internet now at my disposal is slow and expensive, so I may not be writing as much.  Rest assured I will try at least 2 or 3 posts a week with some real material and not just a rundown of my day.  Love you all.  Peace out.

      In further response to the comment from annoymous...sorry, I just don't think people are that responsible.  Heck, I don't even know if I'm that responsible.  Especially if they aren't aware of potential long-term consequences.

      It's fun to mess with people in my field sometimes when they find out I'm not only a Christian but a Republican to boot.  It's often confusing even for me, though.  Take  urlLink this story , for instance.  As a republican, I'm totally all about what Bush is doing.  Give power to the states! Kudos for giving important decision-making powers to the people!  The federal government has its sticky little fingers in enough pots.  Not to mention the fact that land managers and biologists out there THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA to sell off some timber that has been fire-free for way too long and could result in another crazy, destructive, out-of-control wildlfire like we've been seeing over the past few years.  News flash, folks: wildfires are NATURAL.  They're supposed to happen even so often to keep brush down and native habitat, well, habitable and not charred beyond help when a fire does break out.  I know some people (not just wack tree-hugging ecoterrorists who have no understanding about the biology behind land management) have a very hands-off opinion about how we should approach our natural resources and forests.  Ok, I can see your point.  Let nature do its thing and run its course.  That's very idealist and great and all, but humans have messed with nature's systems enough that just letting things run their course would probably be more detrimental than trying to help by active management.  We messed it up by supressing wildfire and preventing forests from naturally purging themselves by desperately trying to protect them from being logged completely.  And this is where I'm a bit conflicted.  If we didn't let the federal government pass roadless area laws and stop those greedy bloodthirsty loggers from taking every last stick and turning it into a matchbox condo, forests as our founding fathers knew them would disappear.  And don't gimme any of that crap about there being so much forest that we don't even know what to do with it and how much uninhabited land there is out there.  Most uninhabited land is the most "useless": deserts, barren mountain-tops, swamps and marshes (that get drained and filled anyway).  The land that is most crucial for many endangered flora and fauna (that's plants and animals for you city folk) is always the land that humans take first too.  Lewis and Clark thought development would never reach the west, and look at us now.    So what to do?  Let individual states decide how to manage their forests which would likely result in far more logging to boost suffering economies, or allow the federal government to decide what's protected and what's not, even in our own backyards?  Do we trust the average joe-citizen to make responsible decisions and not cut down all the wood to make a buck now that will be spent to buy a new car or flat-screen tv to replace the new ones he bought a year ago?  If YOU had 5,000 acres of prime timber and wetland to do with as you pleased would you harvest it and fill it for housing developments so you could get that new siding your wife has been nagging you about and paying off the 5 credit cards you maxed out? Or it is just possible that you would preserve it for its intrinsic value?  Can society as a whole be trusted to make environmentally-conscious decisions to use what we have wisely, leaving some for our great-great-great-great grandchildren?  Or shall we simply give up and say " Not if hell froze over!  Let our government take over and make all our decisons for us!  Let's give them control over our how we spend our money, raise our children, where we live, how long we live, and what to do with our land!  Screw capitalism in any form because I can't be trusted to help my fellow man and do right by the earth.  I'm too selfish and if you give me any control I'll take everything for myself. I DESERVE a new car every year, steak every night for dinner, a new wardrobe every season, so you'd better stop me."   Back to work.  Enjoy the heat if you're in WI today.

        Seems like my life is a lot of waiting.  Sure a lot of things happen, but the "big", "important" things seem to be concentrated in short bursts.  But I am skewed; many things that appear insignificant turn out to be important later.  I need to learn to enjoy each day in itself and not always be looking for tommorow.  I have learned a great deal about gratitude from living on the prairie---I am deeply, deeply grateful for having it right outside my window everyday.  I have not taken it for granted, not one second.     My non-dating pact with myself as all ready paid off---it has kept me from treading too far into potentially complicated territory on at least 2 occasions, although a part of me wanted to.  I know I am not ready.  I know the social groups associated are too small for my hooking up with anyone.  And most importantly, I know throwing caution to the wind more often than not blows a big load of crap back in your face.  Unfortunately we forget that rather easily, especially when it comes to the opposite of sex.  I thought I had to move far away to really run and get away, but I think Milwaukee will be far enough after all.       Anyway, I had a great day in Mad-town: eating great big guac. filled burritos at Chipotle (you missed out Sirvio!!), walking around the capitol and all down State Street, good converstaion over cigars and beer, getting lost, and celebrating 2 friends' birthdays.  Devil's lake was also a good time--a little frisbee, a little splashing in the water, a lot of good times.  Well here I am sitting on the internet squandering precious moments with my housemates whom I have only 1 week more to spend!  Adios amigos...

      Help! I have roughly 8 days of vacation coming to me and no idea how to spend them.  Any thoughts (under $500 would be nice, too)?    That guy from Guadalajara can read me like a book sometimes. Unsettling but intruiging--a chance for me to practice being mysterious and not wear my heart on my sleeve all the time.  But, finally, a man that understands me?  Too bad all the right traits are scattered and never seem to find each other in one body.  Not that it matters at present, as I have sequestered my dating priveliges away until February 11 of next year. Why that random date, you ask?  I decided that in lieu of investing my time into a man who will likely get bored with me anyway, I should dedicate it to, well, myself--who will be focusing on the much more important relationship with Christ (I rescind my comment about not finding all the perfect traits together) and work, and living my own life free from the fetters of love until my heart has rebuilt itself.  Ok, I make it sound all great and noble, but it all ready plays mind games on me, like now that I'm restricted I suddenly want to grab the first thing with 3 legs and have at it.  Anyway Feb. 11 will mark my singleness for one year (and hey, I'm already 5 months into it, so whoo freakin' hoo).  Not that I expect there to be a waiting line at my door, but the idea of telling someone they have to wait and then have them actually do it WOULD actually be noble and great.  So keep your pants on gentlemen: I'm worth waiting for.  Happy Friday

      Spent a good 4 hours playing card games and talking about random topics last night.  The most fun was comparing which movies we'd seen but somehow didn't remember because snogging was involved (that's sucking-face, tonsil-hockey, the age-old term necking, or making-out for those of you who aren't familiar with british slang).   My own favorite story was how this guy I knew in college convinced me to watch Beaches with him, thinking it would get him at least to first base.  He should have taken his bud's advice and picked Spaceballs (apparently this had worked for his friend at some point).  Something tells me even that wouldn't have charmed me into giving it up.  I fled the room and managed to keep from giggling until I was out of sight.   As our pop diva sistas would croon as an FYI to you boys out there:  "I need some stimulation baby, a little conversation baby...."   I need to brush up on my politics.  I HATE election years.  I know the basics and am not a victim of "voter apathy" that befalls so many young adults my age, but it's just so touchy I usually hate to go there, especially when I feel inadequately prepared to defend myself.  It's important to know what we stand for and why we believe what we do in politics just like our faith.  And it hurts my ears when arguments are so obviously a product of the media and liberal college propaganda--only repeated and not thought-through.  As a  urlLink fellow blogger  asserted a few days ago, "WE ARE SEDATED."  But what can we do to break out of that?  People of my generation aren't as upstart and revolutionary as 40 years ago.  We have all of our necessary comforts and thensome, and see no need to protest much unless it's not being able to download free music or rail against a President who is fighting for the rights and freedom of others.  I'm not going to try to change the world.  What I can change is the smaller world around me, the people I come into contact with, the way I do my job, the way I live my life.  I don't need to join a revolution, have sex in public places to save the rainforest (the newest thing in some circles), or lobby for the next election.   I do need to speak out in my own circles when the time is appropriate and the prompting is right.  I do need to be aware of what's going on around me and in the world, and get out of my head and my own limited understanding and interpretation of things.  I do need to realize that I can reach outside my own little world too--that starving children in Africa CAN be helped, and I can help them.  If we can start with awareness, the rest will come.

      I got to run down, catch, hold, and release WILD sandhill crane chix today.  I got soaked, attacked by various insects, and crapped (literally) on, with little sleep and no pay. But SO worth it.  Totally sweet.  And the free breakfast wasn't bad either.  We witnessed these 4 punkish looking teenagers back their car into a tree during it at about 20 miles an hour and then speed off.  People in the sticks are strange.  Quote of the day:  "Red meat and sex don't mix.  Sushi, on the other hand, now that I can see."  E.M. Kutschera   Peeve of the Day: So I've been noticing some "Blog Abuse" by a few fellow bloggers.  Blog abuse happens when someone starts a blog but never updates it or really uses it for its intended purpose.  I don't understand why you would go to the trouble of creating one and then never post in it.  Busyness could excuse you for a while, but it seems to me that true bloggers don't let that get in the way.  If it has outlived its usefulness, then why keep it at all?  I don't write in mine everyday and I wouldn't expect that from anyone--I have a lot to learn about blogging too.  Honestly my life just isn't that interesting sometimes to warrent a post that would even benefit me.  I have a sneaking suspicion some of these guilty abusers just kinda jumped on the bandwagon and thought it would be cool but then quickly lost interest.   Tsk tsk tsk .  For shame!  What's worse is that I bet they've got many great things to say and add to the public readership, but are squandering their potential.  Ok, stepping OFF the soapbox now.  I've got some sleep to catch up on.  After last night's activities I think I'll limit my beer drinking to times when it will wear off before I go to bed.  It makes my already overactive dream life even crazier, and I don't consume enough alcohol to give me any sort of tolerance in the first place.  Cheers--

       I had a rather fun conversation with a well-traveled man from Guadalajara and a well-experienced woman from Madison over dinner.  For whatever reason (my introvertedness) I had originally intended to take my dinner to the tv, but am glad I spent it talking about travel and marriage (one of my other housemates is engaged as of last night--the biggest congrats to Stacy and Travis!) and life and culture and movies and all fun stuff.  I have met the most interesting people here.  Yesterday an american who has spent the last 15 years in Bangkok, has a house in New York and Martha's Vineyard, and knows all about reptiles.  Then there's intern from Bhutan who is always smiling and gracious and just wants to make a difference for the cranes.  However, it's been a lonely couple days.  It appears my suspicions of unwanted attention from an individual of the opposite sex have been confirmed.  How many ways can the phrase  "it was nice to get to see ya today.. i think i had missed you a bit more than i thought"  be taken?  I'm not too proud to admit that a part of me enjoys the attention, but now comes the difficult part of my having to shoot him down and not really wanting to because it would ruin a perfectly good friendship with a perfectly wonderful person that I simply cannot go deeper with.  I struggle especially because I want to be around this person but I know that every friendly intonation of mine will be taken the wrong way.  The lonely part of this is that I don't really want to be alone, but when you wish not to be alone and find yourself with the wrong company the feelings of lonliness are amplified. I am content enough (which probably isn't true contentment) with my singleness but certainly don't wish to remain so, and much to my dismay and frustration I find that even if I were attracted to this person I don't think my heart is ready.    After my last breakup, only ONE person had anything good to say about our relationship or about him.  And we're talkin' mutual, close friends of us both here!  Isn't there something wrong with that?  Was that supposed to be support?  Were all those "well-meaning" friends attempting to assist my heart in healing by saying derogatory things about the past 9 months of my life?  And for the record, despite my heartbreak and bitterness I didn't believe (most of) those things.  I wanted to, I tried.  But I knew him, and either he is not those things, or he was very good at decieving me.  Nonetheless, it was more helpful and comforting to hear someone say "I think you two were so great together.  I wish you hadn't broken up".  Nice to know at least ONE other person besides myself thought we were a good match. I know it sounds like I am not over him.  I am, as much as I can be, and I don't say this for my readers who know the situation to which I am referring (although no one really knows it all--only us two were there for every moment of it).  Does it make me sad that we're not together? Yeah, sometimes.  But I have a life to live with or without him.  This is life and it is not within my power to change what has happened (although it took me some time to come to grips with this).  And certainly I cannot dwell on it.  Of what use am I to myself or the world or to Christ's service if I do that? One definite positive is that I have been able to be a comforter/listener/understand-er for a surprising number of people who went through breakups after I, and I knew what NOT to say.  I am thankful that I was able to do that.  I would have had only sympathy, not empathy, had I not been single.  I never feel like I get all of my thoughts out like I want them.  I am fearful of misunderstanding.  Something that makes this blog terrifying and exhilarating simultaneously.  It's a great learning process.  Another bout of disturbing dreams accompanies my lonliness. It's so dumb, I have nothing to be upset about or complain of!  Alas, I should sleep.  Tommorow is a full social day and I must be on my toes.    Sadly, my tennis match the other night was rained out.  We did get a great warm up in, and OH, it felt so good to hold my racket and feel the tension of ball against strings and hear the smart *POP* of a well-placed backhand.  Rest assured we'll play again before I have to leave, although I think he would have beat me!  Night all.  Safe 4th to you.

      My life is a harsh and ironic frickin' citcom!  I seriously cannot believe some of the things that happen to me.  Take this morning, for example.  No wait, first a bit of background:  a group of my friends went to see Spiderman last night, and I couldn't go because I live far away in a hick town and couldn't make the drive.   Ok, so today.  I happen to see my ex online, and in a moment of friendliness that started this whole debacle (now we will see why I'm an introvert!) I decide to ask how the movie was.  He replies, and then says how its too bad I couldn't make it, etc.  I reply, "Yeah, I was thinking of you all last night" MEANING I was thinking of the entire group of people, not him in particular.  Very shortly thereafter he signs off without a goodbye or anything.  This is not super unusual for him, but when I went back to read our conversation I realized that what I'd said could have been taken in a VERY wrong way, as in I was thinking of HIM all last night.  I could have used a plethora of other words:  group, posse, y'all, everyone, the gang,  etc etc.  But Nooooooo, I had to word it that way.  I officially hate instant messaging.   Actually it's rather funny if you think about it, and after I slapped my forehead in disbelief and ground my teeth together to keep from saying the epithets running through my brain I just started giggling to myself.  I suppose I could be overreacting, or one could argue that I "purposefully" worded it that way because unconsciously I was thinking of him, but that's crap.  I really was missing everyone! I promise!  Whatever.     And now I'm off to play some tennis.  YES!  And may I congradulate both Serena Willams and Amelie Mauresmo today at  urlLink Wimbledon . If I didn't worship God already, you might be first on the list.

      Went to State Fair yesterday with a friend and her family.  I'll never go with more than 6 people again.  Too many adults wanting to do all their own things and I didn't get to see half the things I wanted to.   But, I had a totally fab time and wouldn't trade hanging out with this clan of folks for much---my friend herself is a super spunky one, and multiplying that by 10 immediate and extended family members was quite the crowd.  We more or less ate our way through the day, and the following is a list in no particular order of foods I ate either entirely or had parts of:  Cheese curds Cheese on a stick White chocolate/cranberry cookie Blackberry-cranberry juice Apple Cider Sour cream and chive fries (courtesy of Saz's--yum!) Curly cut potato chips Hot dog w/ ketchup and mustard Shrimp fried rice ice cream Sprite Bottled water various samples of pretzels and dip, cheese, beef jerky, and other fair food  mmm, mmm, gotta love fair food.  If my complexion wasn't already in enough trouble, I'm surely going to suffer now.  Saw all sorts of the newest inventions--the world's greatest mop, juicer, car and cell phone accessories, hair and beauty products, useless crap, interesting crap, etc. etc.  Missed the animal barns :(  Then spent last night bar hopping and celebrating a birthday.  I normally don't have fun at bars but this was definitely an exception, and I don't think I paid for a drink all night.  By bar time I wasn't feeling ok to drive so we went across the street to an all night restaurant and had some coffee and chicken tenders.   I listened without a word and with considerable composure as a friend across the table looked me in the eyes and tell me he had fallen for me.  I had no answers for him, and said as much.  He knows some of my situation, and can't, or won't, understand the rest.   He wanted to know what I was thinking, but there was no way I could explain how incredulous I was feeling at the increased irony of my life.   I've said it's very ironic before, but this is getting ridiculous--not because of boys, but because of the way life itself works out.  I cannot explain all the little parts that might help the reader understand; just take my word for it.  Perhaps life in general is ironic and I am simply becoming more aware of it.  Anyway, not to mention the influence of alcohol probably wasn't helping.  I think we will work it out to still be friends, and I don't think he was in deep enough to be terribly hurt.  I am hurt because I hate drama like this, and because I don't want to reject him but the alternative is out of the question.   Fondness and friendship is no reason to become involved.  But to finish my story, I crashed at a safe place until I woke up around 5:30 and drove home.  I'm becoming increasingly grateful for 3-day weekends.   I need to start organizing my time better, however.  The more busy and social I am the less time I spend with Jesus and the more I do things like drink and give attention to boys.  I'm fairly sure this is not why God sent me to Milwaukee.   I am not sure why yet, but I doubt these activities will speed my finding out.  I am learning more about myself though.  And I am learning to know myself better and more clearly see the bigger picture.  I had inklings of it before, but it's coming into a better focus.  I am grateful.
