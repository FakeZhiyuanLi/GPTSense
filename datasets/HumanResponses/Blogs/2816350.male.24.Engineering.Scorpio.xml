        We outcast them. We never try to know the past. We decide the present. We don't care about the future.   Let me just trace back things to something common that happened in these peoples lives and try to figure out the point of deviation from normal human behavior. They were normal like u and like me. I would say they were far better than what you and I are. They believed in a set of things. The only mistake they make in common is TRUST people like you and me. They trust u and me so much that they take it for granted that we are as good as they are. As long as this trust exists they keep going higher and higher in life. Unparalleled. Undisturbed by anything. They are the most supreme beings on earth in terms of quality of life they lead. They have no clue of how mean we are. We fear them. We betray them. It sometimes takes ages for them to even accept what ever happened. In extreme cases they never accept it. They decide to react. To maintain the equilibrium of life one has to ejaculate every ounce of pain that enters body some way or the other. The degree of pain coupled with the time which catalyzes the reproduction of pain, shapes them to what they are today. We never feel ashamed of ourselves or sorry for them. We prove them guilty. We decide their fate. We eliminate them because they are not the one among us. Was Darwin [ " Fittest survive, Others are Exterminated " ] right ?

       Is it really worth spending any amount on them ?   1. Every educational organization has a yahoo group or a substitute associated with it  2. Have a profile to be filled by every member of a group  3. Have a bot as a member of every group.  4. Connect all these bots together into another group, say "YahooMatchingBot".  5. Build logic such that YahooMatchingBot collects all the profiles, matches it with others and sends back individual mails to the profile owners.   What do ya think ?

         "Vaishali Ramesh Wankhede, a rickshaw puller's daughter, who had cleared the All-India pre-medical test (PMT) fighting against allodds, has got admission into Government Medical College (GMC), inNagpur. GMC sources confirmed her name in the list of students, announced onFriday all over the state."I am extremely happy to learn that I would be pursuing my medicaleducation in the city where I am born and brought up", Vaishali, whohad scored 85.5 per cent marks in PMT, said.Vaishali had scored 73 per cent in SSC and 81 per cent in HSC fromDharampeth Tarkunde Junior College. A good Samaritan H C Kaliwalehad helped her in pursuing her education by regularly providing hertips and books.Her father Ramesh had given up pulling rickshaw due to poor healthwhile mother Maya earns livelihood as a domestic help.The City Police Commissioner, D Shivanandan had recently felicitatedher and presented her a purse of Rs 10,000 for her meritoriousperformance."       The progress she is making is pretty impressive. Her success should be publicized to a greater level so that&nbsp;people living close to the poverty line can motivate themselves and start to compete. This could be a first step towards erradicating the&nbsp;controversial reservation system in India.   &nbsp;  Most important - I&nbsp;feel the need of a counselor to&nbsp;help them&nbsp;stay focused&nbsp;during the phases of transition in the social surroundings.&nbsp;
