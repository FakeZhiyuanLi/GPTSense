      The document we got our hands on is based on the first publicly introduced version of the Nintendo DS (also known as the E3-edition). Since the device hasn't changed that much (apart from the looks), this might be an interesting read... Let's start with power supply of the Nintendo DS. Fully charging the Nintendo DS' battery will take about 3 hours. The battery itself can be recharged up to 500 times, using the Nintendo DS AC adapter. The Nintendo DS AC adapter can be used with, how predictable, the Nintendo DS itself. However, the adapter can also be used to charge the Game Boy Advance SP. If we look closely, we can still see the remains of the original codename of the Nintendo DS: Nitro. 'NTR-CPU-X2A', together with the Nintendo logo printed on both sides of the motherboard in every Nintendo DS unit. We can also see for sure that the D-pad won't function as an analogue stick in any way. And finally, a word of advice. While playing the Nintendo DS using the wireless multiplayer capabilities, keep at least 22 centimeters of distance from anyone using a heart pacemaker (or so the manual prescribes)...

      The Nintendo DS has officially been named the... Nintendo DS!! Even though the name was said to change at E3 in May, Nintendo has admitted that it will be named the DS. "Nintendo DS, originally chosen as the code name, has been selected as the official product name," said a Nintendo spokesperson in a statement. "The Nintendo DS name evokes the idea of a portable system with 'dual screens', providing the rationale for the final name." Despite the name staying the same, the actual design of the machine has been changed dramatically, from the DS shown in LA a few months back. Nintendo described the new look as a "slimmer, sharper looking device." It will launch in Japan and America later this year.

       -Battery life:  The DS will run for about 10 hours on one lithium battery charge.   -The DS card slot:  The DS games are smaller than SD cards used in digital cameras. To take the DS games out, you simply press the cart and it'll 'pop' out.   -The GBA card slot:  You can still play GBA games on it, however Nintendo also revealed that this slot might be able to be used for DS accessories; camera, motion sensor ect.   -DS functionality in GBA games:  GBA games would recognize that they are in an 'advanced technology' system, allowing bonuses such as making use of the dual screens. That all depends on the designers...

       This was written for CE and will be posted there in the near future. When it is, I will link to the preview on CE.    The Urbz, EA’s latest iteration of the popular Sims franchise, is coming to all consoles around November-time, with the aim of ‘urbanising’ your Sims and focusing more on their social lives, as well as building up your ‘rep’ among your fellow Urbz in the city of Miniopolis. Your days within the city are filled with various tasks which result in your ‘Urb’ earning new objects and beads (which can be exchanged for power-ups). Your Urb (you only control one) worries less about aspects more important in previous games, such as hygiene (so don’t stand too near him). You can also gain features such as insomnia, allowing you more time to focus on the life of your Urb. The graphics look similar to the GBA version sadly – not much use of the DS’s advanced graphical capabilities.   So, what will make the DS version of The Urbz special, compared to its GBA cousin? Well, for starters, the DS will not only have unique objects not seen in the GBA version, such as sensory deprivation tanks (as well as more of them – at grand total of 140 objects), but the DS version will play host to five exclusive minigames which will require use of the touch screen – and which allow you to compete with your friends, thanks to the machines’ wireless capabilities. As for the main game, future DS gamers can look forward to seeing seven new characters, eight new species of pets, a PDA style interface involving the touch screen, and an extra mission in an all-new, DS exclusive area called Splicer Island. To ‘splice’ something is to join two or more things together – will we be seeing some innovative use of the two screens, perhaps? Or maybe joining something with the stylus? This is all just speculation – but either way, with ‘The Urbz’ slated as a launch title for the DS, import gamers will soon see if EA can deliver the goods come November.

      Nintendo have revealed the finished design for their new DS handheld - and quite frankly, it's gorgeous.        Nintendo have taken the DS from childish to stylish. Along with the innovative features, Nintendo are proving that they aren't just in it for the kids, as so many Sony fanboys believe. Better graphics don't make a good handheld - but better gameplay does. And the excellent desgin helps too. Take that PSP!  Nintendo have also decided to keep the Nintendo DS moniker, which makes sense considering how well known the name is among both fans and the industry.
