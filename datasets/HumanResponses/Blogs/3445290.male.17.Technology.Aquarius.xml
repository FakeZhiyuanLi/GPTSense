           I have lived in surrey for 6 years now but when my family pretty much went from riches to almost rags because of family matters that involved drug abuse and bad tenants, we moved out of the nice suburban area that I lived in during my "tween years"(10-13) and moved towards the downtown/industrial part of Surrey(Whalley/Bridgeview). In the first few years of living in this area I experienced new things and learned a lot about the streets while never actually getting involved with the wrong crowds or doing drugs. One of the things that gives the area I reside in a really bad rep is that it is known for is the poor people and crack addicts but sometimes the crack addicts can seem humorous because they do what I call "the chicken dance" where their brain makes their body tweak out and have no control over their body for a short period of time. They also cross streets without looking which makes some drivers quite angry, yell at anonymous people for staring, smell really bad, urinate on public buildings out in the open, cause public mischief, and pretty much bring down the property value of everything around them therefore making them a threat to society.      The sad thing is these people, many of them came from good family's and some from bad ones but were neglected or just got in with the wrong crowd and it just went all downhill from there for them I suppose.      Although the city of Surrey has been enforcing the RCMP on these people with their patty wagons I always see when walking back and forth to school I sure do hope that they are not just locking them up to teach them a lesson because that wont do anything, they will be back on the streets in no time.      We need to help them get away from drug addiction and to just start their life all over again and maybe even use their past experiences to help out others in the past position.      If you think it is not worth our tax payers money to help these people, think of all the money that goes to basic healthcare needs for these addicts who are constantly overdosing and damaging their body's, causing pain and stress for family members, and always requiring special services such as welfare, needing food from the food bank and the way they drag down tourism, property value, and take up the RCMP's time for nothing when they could be educated and working to contribute to a greater cause, that being Canada.  **Anyways I hope you found that big mess of paragraphs enlightening, I am going to the gym now and hopefully my shoulder heals cause I guess I have irritated it a lot and I am still looking for a job so I'm going to try my luck handing out resumes in the industrial parts of surrey and I will update my blog again tomorrow if I am not too tired. L8R!!.**

          I myself am non religious, most likely because I think like a scientist and demand proof which means that I cannot rely on good faith and also because I was sick of going to church as a young child because I found it extremely boring so as soon as I gained freedom to make my own choices I decided that I would not go to church. One reason that I do not believe in religion is because I notice that in the olden days religious leaders used to use censorship, fear, and propaganda in order to keep their followers obeying their orders almost like a militia or a corrupt government and they prevented improvements by banishing anyone who dared to believe that they had more intelligence then church leaders as another way to stay in power for longer. Another thing I do not like is in every religion there tends to be a reward that will be given to a righteous follower in the after life which seems ridiculous because if it really were true and we knew for sure that we would be getting a reward when we die churches would be packed and nobody would commit crimes and people might even try to kill themselves on purpose or like the Islamic cultures where the Muslim men become suicide bombers so they may be known as martyrs.       don't get me wrong now, to everything negative I believe there is a positive and "modern" churches definitely give out a good vibe because they help people that cannot help themselves, they build a sense of community, people that attend church tend to make the world a better place, and it helps promote social interaction between people which does not happen as much anymore.    I myself could never possibly believe in a greater power that controls the universe, I personally believe that all of us organisms living on the planet earth somehow evolved from small bacterias that began to evolve to better adapt to the changing of the planets characteristics.  **Anyways its the weekend now and its late so I'm going to bed and catch up on some much needed sleep and who knows, maybe ill dream about some sort of greater power telling me something and I will create a religion called "Brophism" ...lol well L8R!!**

          Man, the last few months have been awesome because I used to always whine, grobble, and make excuses for why I was so short and skinny(because I was on the computer too much) but lately I have been noticing that I have been growing rapidly and I am finally able to gain weight(cause I been eating more protein/carbs and exercising). It is just such a relief to know that I did grow into a normal sized man which I believe is around 6 feet tall.The reason I was worried about not being a normal size because I noticed that all the other Asian men that I see in my community are quite a lot shorter than the European and black men in my area and especially since my father is 5'11" and my mom is 5'3", and I am half Asian and half Caucasian at 6'0".      The best part about finally hitting my growth spurt is the reaction I get from old friends or even old school bullies who used to always pick on me because of my size and made me so size conscious and nervous since I'm bigger than a few of them now. But I don't think I've finished growing because my shoulders are still kind of narrow, and I am yet to have facial hair but everything is where it should be and appears to be operating healthy so I'm not too worried anymore, just glad to have it off my shoulders.  **even tho I'm getting bigger and really starting to feel like a man I'm still a computer geek/fanatic at heart and I'm sure always will be!**

          After being through Socials 11 and learning about WW1/2 I seemed to have developed quite a patriotism for Canada and have much more respect for our country as being a peacekeeper and being a democratic and socialist society even tho we also have a bureaucratic government. The reason I am thinking of joining the army is because I really feel like I take my freedom for granted and that I must pay my dues to help protect our country. Another reason I feel like joining is because I have always liked the idea of war and the strategies involved and I subliminally desire to be disciplined.      I realize this could be a decision that could put me in the grave at a young age but its always going to be on my mind. It is not like this is a final decision I have made because there are so many things in the technology field that I could really see myself excelling in such as a electrician, graphic designer, website designer, advertising multimedia, marketing, and since I've started working out firemen and police officer(and yes the soldier again) have come to mind. To summarize my talent or the type of person I am I would say that I am a very creative and technical person who takes risks to achieve greatness. On the other hand I can be unorginized, lazy, and paranoid about how economy will fall, world will end and things like that   For now I think ill just keep my mind on graduating with a good GPA.  Its late, Been great, write to you tomorrow mate.

          Lately the weeks seem like days, they have just been flying by and I feel like I haven't done anything exciting in a long time. I recently got some new channels that my parents ordered on the TV (Movie Central) and I never used to watch much TV but now I find myself in front of it for hours on end losing track of time slowly becoming a couch potato because these new channels have all the newest movies on and there is always something good to watch. I really got to break this TV watching cycle because I already don't get out enough because of my computer, school, work, and fitness and it makes time fly by so fast that I don't even realize what time it is and I finally get to my homework by 10 PM then I'm to tired and ill put it off to the next day and will give it to my teacher of late marks. Well, I have decided I'm going to try to break the cycle and add this to my list of monthly goals and resist the temptation of sitting on the couch after getting back from school.     I have recently started putting out my resume to get a head start on the whole summer employment thing and am really hoping that I get a job at this grocery store in my community(Especially since ill get a discount on FOOD!!). The reason I need a job is because with my habits of buying expensive protein powders, gym fees, saving so I can finally leave home and gain independence, entertainment(amusement park, movies, ect..), clothes, upgraded/new computer equipment and not getting much money from web design I really need a part time job that pays hourly wages like most people receive.  Well its 6 PM so I'm off to the gym and I promise, no matter what, I wont watch a minute of that dreaded brain melting TV and actually catch up on my homework especially since all my classes are academic this semester.

           This really pisses me off, Every day I walk, take public transit, take nutrition from the nutrition store and work out for a hour and a half to  two hours and keep my body clean. I work so hard to keep my environment clean but all these fat yuppies are driving their cars causing global warming and a bad quality of air for me and especially future generations. I really think people need to get back on their bikes and start using their legs to get around instead of complaining about gas prices and being too overweight. Its really quite strange, in such nice areas like parks and sidewalks, they are hardly ever used and its almost a "rare" thing to see pedestrians now. Anyways I got a lot of homework to do right now so I'm out.  **PS: this is my first blog**

          Damnit! I have always considered myself a very polite person and moderately obedient for a teenager but I think my mother has gone to far in trying to train me into being her pet or robot. It is ridiculous, whenever my father and mother fight I somehow end up with a lot of the flack in the end. Like today when I dropped a bottle of root beer soda my mother freaked out on me because I made noise and she wanted me to say sorry for dropping the pop and reminded me that next time I should say "I am sorry mommy, I dropped the rootbeer and I wont do it again" (other days she requires me to say things like "I am leaving for school mommy I love you very much" which is a bit excessive if you have to force people to say they love you). Other things she tells me is that I should quit going to the gym 4 days a week and that I should quit my job because i dont make enough money compared to her but I CAN ONLY WORK A PART TIME JOB DUE TO SCHOOL!! She just does not have any understanding of western ways and always says crazy Canada this and Crazy canada that!. I mean this usually happens to me on a regular basis where I am either the scapegoat or the dog they kick when I piss them off in a small way but I will not put up with it when I just got back from a work shift and I am also tired from working out for 2 hours(Usually I am quite immune to this type of treatment since I have grown up with it). Its really quite a stupid how my mother continually bothers me and trys to blackmail me or decide not to give me money when I need it for basic needs then ask me the next day casually if I am going to take care of her really well when she is older and buy her a nice big house(I always tell her what she wants to hear but too bad she does not understand the concept of karma or heard the song "cats in the cradle").     I think it is unfair to force your children to pay the consequences of your misfortunate emotional relationship with your spouse because it just piles on to the emotional pile of crap that kid takes on a daily basis from school, work, home, friends, relationships, self esteem, and extracurricular activities. Its nowonder so many kids decide to run away from home or commit suicide or turn to other types of drastic measures (and I can name tons of incidences which are a direct result of this type of treatment).     **anyways this was good for me, it was kind of like talking to a counselor because I was able to get a bunch of stuff of my back that was bothering me. I really am a quite and polite person and keep things to myself usually but everyone has their limits and they are just ticking timebombs ready to explode on the next little peeve or annoyance that bothers them. This is one pissed off brophy saying L8R!**

              In the last 3 days I had found out that my grandmother of 75 years in age on my fathers side is suffering from a serious illness called  metasis (I think its a brain or lung illness or tomber). I am not totally sure on the details of the illness but I do know that she is still able to communicate through body language and she can listen. This is a very sad period for the Brophy family since she is a very well respected mother of four children (one who happens to be my father). Its really quite a shame that this had happened because I really wanted to see my grandparents this summer since I really don't have any recollection of their characters, personality's, physical appearances, and don't really know them at all since we live on opposite sides of Canada (east and west or Montreal and British Columbia). One thing I know is that for the longest time I had not been in contact with my dads side of the family (The "Brophy's") until the last year when we began exchanging emails and even making plans to meet but lately since my grandmothers illness it seems like we are coming together and keeping in contact to keep up-to-date on my grandmothers condition so in a small way this is good because it brings family together in a time of tragedy. I have never really suffered a loss of anybody really close to me or anyone related to me in blood that I can remember but I am sure it is hard for my father and his brothers since their mother was so involved in their upbringing and was partly responsible for the type of people they became. Its just quite hard to imagine that without her giving birth to my father, my father would not have been able to give me life and the fact that I have no recollection or memory of this person of importance to me just makes me a bit disappointed because what am I going so tell future generations of brophy's if they ever ask about my grandmother.     I know that if I was sick and had a high chance of death then I would seriously be considering some spiritual guidance (even tho I don't personally believe it because I am a atheist) at the moment because you are doing something that nobody has ever been able to come back and talk about. Its like entering a foreign land and leaving your loved ones but not knowing if there is everything you could have ever imagined or just nothing at all happens and your just plain gone. I don't mean to be blunt or cold but after maturing a little I realize that life is quite brutal and usually what you expect is not what you get.     I am really hoping that my grandma Claire brophy will be able to pull through this somehow even tho the illness she has is extremely serious because we only realize how much we miss someone when they are gone and we wish there is something more we could have done at the time but what is done is done.     **anyways IM going to go have another mid night snack so i'm off the computer. PS: Grandma Claire, even tho I am a atheist I will be wishing you all the luck in the world to fight that illness for as long as possible. Remember, perseverance is the key to success in life so never give up and don't surrender when the going gets tough.**

          Finally, summer vacation is here! For some people this is the best time of the year because the stress levels are at a alltime low, the beaches are full of beautiful people and its relaxing, for students we can earn quite a bit more money then usual, and people are going on vacations.    Summer for me is not as fun as it should be. I am going to be doing summer school throughout the whole time and I'm going to be working two jobs and the worst part is that it will be so hot that I will never get any sleep from all the humidity during work too.    Anyways, in my new job I'm still a rookie in sales and am not making as many sales as my fellow employees who are making around 300-400$ just working at max around 12 hours a week and I'm quite scared because of the results of the final exams which are really scary. I am planning on saving up for nutrition and a personal trainer to get me started working out properly and I am intent on getting a new computer and some new gadgets and I could really use some new articles of clothing....LOL anyways enough of all that bitching and moaning cause its late and I'm gone. LATER!!!!

           Just great! Its exam time, for students that tend to leave everything on the backburner like me are now making sure we know our stuff and handing in all our missing assignments in the last two weeks of school. This is the most stressful time of the school year where you miss a lot of sleep and study all night and wake up really early just to refresh your memory because these exams pretty much make you or break you in your future education and career.     I myself have to do quite well in my final exams because I consider myself a average student in everything except technology sciences such as computer science so I have to do well on my other finals or else I may be lying at a "c-" or possibly even a "I"(fail) if I do really bad on either my math or socials exam. Ontop of my final exams I also have my provincial exams which are completely new to me but I know they are used to compare schools all across British Columbia which will most likely be quite hard.      Last but not least I also have to take a extra class during the summer to graduate on time such as physics(cause I plan to get my electricians ticket) or math since I was taking a easier version of math when I was younger since I was so lazy.  ****Anyways this whole week is going to be extremely busy for me because I have to make flyers for a new store in surrey, Help a friend put up a neon sign at the mall, work out, do door to door sales, and study and do homework like crazy. So as you can see this week is going to be pretty insane with expectations coming from all over the place.**

           So anyways ya, I have been working as a sales representative for about a week now and my days vary in wage depending on how many sales I can make in 3-4 hours going door to door as a canvasser. I have to say that I really don't like the fact that some days I might not make anything and some days ill make 20-30 bucks a hour but the best part is that I get to travel around(like Calgary, Edmonton, Denver, ect..), hang around other people my own age with similar problems and reasons for having to work, I constantly get free bonuses like free dinner and extra money, and when it comes down to it for me this job is all about having a good time. Another thing I like is I get to learn a lot about human negotiation and study peoples tendencies to make impulse buys by complementing them and showing them that I have a lot of energy and making them feel guilty for not buying my stuff. It really is quite a interesting job and I am going to stick with it as long as I can even tho my parents want me to quit when I have a bad day but they don't see what the senior sales reps make($300-$480/week for 3 hours a day and 4-6 days a week with extremely flexible schedule).     The only problem with this job is I gotta get home as quick as I can and am not able to go to the gym as often even tho I get about 3 hours of cardio in from just this jobs requirement to walk all the time. Another problem is I tend to get home late and just end up slacking on the homework because I am too tired after a shift.     **Well I gotta get up tomorrow morning(Saturday) at 8am to work a shift till about 4pm so I'm gunna go catch up on my beauty sleep cause these bags under my eyes don't look too great.**

           It seems so ridiculous nowadays how people really don't live within their means. I hated being a child when my mom would complain about not having enough things of luxury like a bigger house, nice new cars, clothing that is ridiculously expensive, and a bunch of oversized flatscreen TV's. I don't understand the human tendencies to spend money on things they don't need and really cant afford and just dig a big hole for themselves in the long run. I know this from experience after watching my parents complain about money troubles all the times yet they were still making impulse buys even tho they were thousands of dollars in debt and had some serious problems which needed to be dealt with first.     When my family was considered middle class or rich we kept on running up bills for things we could not afford, I was really not a very happy child because we were constantly moving into "nicer houses" which made it hard for me to make friends and my parents were always working to make more and more money which made for a very unhappy child since I was always neglected and a loner (thank god for my computer) and unhappy parents since their lives revolved around work and the only happiness they found was through alcohol (at least for my father).     I just think that too many people try too hard to be someone that their not and really try their best to impress others while never taking the time to make sure they are feeling good about themselves.      One thing that I learn time and time again in my life is everything has got to be balanced or your going to tip over. People need to learn how to balance relationships, finances, fitness, nutrition, work, education, fun, and all those other things that are essential to a persons life.  Anyways I got some things to do (play starcraft and review for finals) so I'm going to get to it. LAAAATE!

      Been super busy lately. Friday I got off school at 3:30pm&nbsp;and straight to work until 10 PM, went straight home to go to sleep then got up at 6AM for work in Nanaimo and got back at 10pm then straight to sleep I went again then got up again at 6AM to work at the Pacific National Exhibition lottery home until 5:15 then went for a workout at the gym and crammed 5 hours of homework in for a chapter test in math&nbsp;the next morning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things have been quite busy over the summer and I was planning on visiting old freinds and doing outdoor activities more than i have been but work and education get in the way of playtime which kinda sucks but it should pay off in the longrun. I have also changed my dieting program to eat more nutritious foods such as tuna, salmon, and chicken which i prepare in mass amounts to make it convienient to eat every 2-3 hours&nbsp;since i need a minimum intake of 130 grams of protein a day and still take supplements to improve my gains in the gym. &nbsp; **Sorry this post had to be so quick but i really just dont have the time at this moment in time to constantly update my blog. Gunna prepare some food&nbsp;for the next few days&nbsp;and go to sleep to cram geometry the next morning so this is good bye for now. GOOD BYE!**

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yup, I'm starting to experiment with drugs but not the kind that your most likely thinking of. If you have read any of my last posts you will know that&nbsp;I have began working out on a regular basis but now&nbsp;I feel like I'm really getting into this whole workout thing&nbsp;so I have started experimenting with all different types of drugs to enhance performance and results in the gym (except anabolic steroids). Some of the supplements that I have been taking are extra strength multi-vitamins, glutamines, weight gainers with a lot of protein and a lot of carbs, creatine, flax oils, herring oil's for my omega 3-6-9's and at last but not really a supplement, 1-2 gallons of water daily because of the creatine. I do realize that some of the things I am taking are a bit risky since not too many study's have been conducted on these supplements and most of them do a number on the liver but I'll take my chances in order to gain some results quickly.&nbsp;It is very interesting to observe my body slowly change and the weird noises and contractions my body keeps&nbsp;making throughout the&nbsp;day.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **anyways my mother is making empty threats to me&nbsp;to go to sleep even though&nbsp;I have no reason to get up early in the morning tommorow but I don't want to be on her really bad side so I better get to sleep. Keep you up-to-date on next post so l8r**&nbsp;

              Yep, today I bought a pair of 200$ rollerblades because I think it would be a great way to get a cardiovascular leg workout and get around to where I got to go quickly during the summer. It was a young French guy from my gym that is always rollerblading all over the place that gave me the inspiration and initiative to get my blades and start practicing my quick turns, accelerating, and stopping techniques which is not as easy as you may think it is(got quite a few bruises in trial and error). Anyways I consider myself a pretty good rollerblader now and I plan on waking up tomorrow morning to go get a quick workout in, pack a lunch, strap on my blades, and possibly gather a friend or two to make a trip around the whole Stanley park seawall which is about a 7 mile trip.     Lately I have been extremely busy because of math 11 in summer school because I work out 2 hours in the morning then have to do 3 hours of homework in the morning, take a 30 minute bus to my school and get there by 12:15pm and work in that class till 3:30pm since 1 day there is equivalent to 1 week of normal school which means I get a shitload of homework per day, THEN! Go to work at 4pm constantly having to deal with rejection until 9:45pm then I get home and have about 30 minute of freetime and then I rinse and repeat the day. Sounds like I'm having a fun summer huh? ontop of that I gotta take up my weekends freetime up with my job at the PNE doing customer service courses and working preview days showing a bunch of old retired women a million dollar home and saying the same speech over and over again. It really is actually quite a fun job but it does get repetitive but atleast I get to communicate with people because people skills are very important.     **Well its late so I'm gunna relax and make myself a midnight snack consisting of perogies and "Ren and Stimpy" gummy's**

               Dreams are a weird thing, some nights I wont have any or remember any dreams at all but others I will have a series and they are sometimes so dramatic and get my heart pumping so fast that I even wake up in a night sweat. One example is of last nite I had dreamt what it would be like to have not had my parents around, another dream I had was of my mother checking my wallet to see if there was any money inside there and my last dream was that I had to pay a scary visit to the dentist. All these dreams I found very peculiar since my parents have been getting themselves into a lot of trouble lately, my mother constantly checks my wallet and my room to find any money or anything incriminating, and that same night I fell asleep forgetting to brush my teeth.     They say our dreams have a superior intelligence in them: a wisdom and cleverness that guides us. They convey to us illuminating insights. They warn us about danger. They predict future events. They hint at the deeper meaning of life. Dreams steer us to an adapted, wise attitude toward life. I have had my fair share of interesting dreams but I cant wait until the ultimate deep sleep to find out what really happens when the brain is no longer spoon fed oxygen from the heart. Is there really a spiritual greater power who plotted us here on the earth? Or do we just stop thinking and are no longer active in the physical world? All these questions and more answered in the next episode of "My Life".     **Ok, well enough of that. I'm going to the gym and I'm going to go walk around Granville island now since I got my unlimited monthly skytrain pass on me. Bye, and sweet dreams!**

              When I began working as a sales representative for circulation marketing I started as a rookie so not much was expected of me but I find that since I have been here longer they have a much higher expectation of you to make a lot more sales to meet the crew managers goals and i really was not meeting those goals and people would just slam their doors in my face after the presentation. I was feeling down for a long time just knocking on these doors and putting on a act of enthusiasm and a rubber smile because there were some problems in other parts of my life too but as soon as I reached this one house I started talking to the family and they let me in their house and offered me dinner and really wanted to show me some of their wood works they had made and thought nothing of getting a trial of the Vancouver Sun Newspaper which played a big part in my total change in attitude this week because a small group of people made my day by being nice to me and socializing in a friendly manner with me for just 10 minutes which made all the difference. After that house for some reason everyone was suddenly nice when I had this positive attitude on me and I was able to get 3 sign-ups within a 30 minute time span which is really awesome since I get 10$ per sign-up in commission.     I also ran into a tarot card reader who did not want the paper since she already had it but when I walked away she mentioned what the rune stone that I wear on my neck 24/7 was called "Rune Beoric" and meant "The birch was a tree of inception" which supposedly means that others around me may be affected by negativity but my necklace protects me from any negative energy and always indicates a physical birth either of a child or of an idea which means I am reborn as a person when I free myself from any negativity I may already have and is one of four cycle runes, it signifies growth in relationships, families, fertility and fruition. Like i said in other posts i really dont believe in anything spiritual but I have noticed that since i got this necklace from thailand I have been closer to my dads side of the family and I really never feel stressed about much anymore. The tarot card reader also mentioned that she just studied that in the morning so I was finding a lot of coincidences going on that day.       **Anyways, the moral of this post is to treat all people, even the dreaded sales person with some respect and kindness because it really does make all the difference in their lives when they are just having a hard time in their life's. Its 9:15am so I'm gunna eat and go for a quick workout so see U l8r!**
