      We've known for a while now that Cornelius Fudge and the other top-level bureaucrats at the Ministry of Magic were nothing more than Soviet-style apparatchiks, men who know just two kinds of people--enemies and underlings.  We knew  that  back at the end of book four when Fudge stuck his head in the sand after Dumbledore, Snape and Potter presented incontestible proof that Lord Voldemort was back.  Now we also know how utterly incompetent they are.  Consider this article ripped from the pages of The Daily Prophet (chapter twenty-five in  The Order of the Phoenix , so if you haven't read this far you might not want to read this post):   The Ministry of Magic announced late last night that there has been a mass breakout from Azkaban.  Speaking to reporters in his private office, Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, confirmed that ten high security prisoners escaped in the early hours of yesterday evening, and that he has already informed the Muggle Prime Minister of the dangerous nature of these individuals.   So Fudge wants Tony Blair to be on the lookout for Death Eaters?  Tony Blair has been the Mayor of Basra for two months, and he has yet to find a single weapon of mass destruction!  How's he going to track down a bunch of serial-killing   wizards   on the lam?  If only our heroes were Californians rather than British.  Then they could  urlLink recall  Fudge.

       My former hometown, Sweet Springs, Missouri , has made the international press.  When we lived there in the mid-90s, we'd often see a disabled man zipping down the sidewalk in a motorized wheelchair.  Since we moved, the man graduated to a golf cart.    Now that golf cart is at the eye of a hurricane of small town controversy.  It seems that the local police chief ordered the man to drive his golf cart home, or else he'd be cited.  The police chief maintains that a recent change in state law prohibits driving golf carts on public roads.  Not according to the state attorney general's office, which responded to querries by the local newspaper editor about whether or not golf cart are considered vehicles under Missouri law.  The editor of the  Sweet Springs Herald , and many "concerned citizens," have been sharply critical of the police chief, but to date he has the backing of the mayor and the city council.  (Full disclosure--my wife is a former employee of the  Sweet Springs Herald ).  Both  urlLink CNN  and  urlLink The Guardian , a British newspaper, have run stories about the Sweet Springs golf cart controversy.  I think that this is the most publicity for this part of the world since neighboring Green Ridge, Missouri was nuked in the 1983 movie "The Day After."  I wonder if the Soviets cried "Fore!" before they let that particular missile rip.

       Anti-war or Civil War?   When I went on vacation I left my razor at home.  Now my facial hair is racing to catch up to the hair on my head, which hasn't been this long since my last year in seminary.  I say that it's a look befitting any war protester, but my wife says that if I were a blond, I'd be a dead ringer for General Custer.  Sigh.  It's so hard to make a statement these days.

       "People talk about the 'divorce epidemic'  as if it were a disease that could and should be cured," complained columnist Jennifer Just in my local newspaper Sunday.  The real problem with divorce, she argues, is the stigma that still cloaks those 39 million Americans who, for one reason or another, have decided to untie the knot.    After all, she reasons, folks live a lot longer than they used to.  Isn't it unrealistic to expect men and women to "live, sleep and grow in tandem with the same person til death do them part, which statistically is 50 years and up?"  Today, divorce ends marriages at about the same point that death did a century ago.  And, she adds, the sheer numbers of divorced people demand that we re-evaluate our old prejudices.  "39 million people can't be all wrong," writes Just.  A shrewd argument, I'll have to admit.  I'll be mulling it over come Saturday when I assist in a wedding ceremony.  Perhaps I'll issue a disclaimer to the bride and groom:  "Be warned that the person you're exchanging rings with today is probably not the person you'll want to be sitting beside when your children do this."  In Just's world, we'd have one spouse for our carefree twenty-somethings, a second one to raise the kids with, yet another spouse to enjoy the empty nest phase, and maybe a fourth to drool with in the nursing home common area.    Reformed Christians speak of marriage as a "covenant."  That's a biblical term for the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship which, at least from God's side, is one of  hesed , often translated "steadfast love."  God's love is not a dreamy, eye-fluttering romanticism.  It is durable, faithful, broad and deep.  If marriage is indeed a covenant, an opportunity to express in horizontal terms the abiding love that binds us with our heavenly Father, then why can't our increasing life expectancies be an opportunity to plumb the depths of that love even further?  But is Just justified in complaining that divorce and divorced people are unduly stigmatized?  Her opinion is seconded by a five year study of the family  that the Presbyterian Church's Advisory Committee on Social Witness Policy presented to the General Assembly last month.  The report stressed an inclusive attitude toward all household forms.  What really counts, the report contended, is how the various forms function and the quality of their communicative process.   Of course churchgoers should avoid judgmentalism.  But a generation of data on the family are in, and there's no way to avoid making some judgments.  In their book  The Case for Marriage:  Why Married People Are Happier, Healthier and Better Off Financially , Linda White and Maggie Gallagher report the following:  1.  Mortality rates are 50% higher for unmarried women and 250% higher for unmarried men than their married counterparts. 2.  Married men and women are more satisfied with their sex lives than co-habitating men and women.   3.  On the verge of retirement, the typical married couple has accumulated $410,000, compared to $167,000 for the never married, $154,000 for the divorced, $151,000 for the widowed and just under $96,000 for the seperated. 4.  Married men are far less likely to abuse their wives and children than unmarried men are to abuse their lovers or minor children with whom they live.  Now, is it judgmental to report these facts?  Not any more judgmental than it is to report that smoking increases your chances of getting cancer, and that a high fat diet increases your risk of heart disease.  Don't shoot the messenger.  Why can't the church deal with marriage and divorce the way that the health care system deals with good health?  Doctors put out the word that immunizations, exercise, and a diet blessed with fresh fruits and vegetables are the keys to good health.  At the same time enormous amounts of time and energy are invested in healing the sick, even those whose diseases are largely the result of poor lifestyle choices.  No lung cancer patient is denied chemotherapy because he or she was a smoker.  In like manner, congregations need to encourage their members to get married and stay married, and equip them with the skills and virtues that make for a good marriage.  At the same time the church needs to welcome divorced men and women.  When a person goes through a divorce, that individual has often been through hell.  God forbid that the church be a community that shoots its wounded.

      Was the Iraq War a "just war?"  Note the quotes around "just war."  I'm asking if the Iraq War met the criteria for waging war that Christian theologians have developed over the centuries, the so-called Just War Theory.  I'm not asking if the Iraq War was technically legal under US or international law, politically shrewd, or defensible on the basis of a cost-benefits analysis.  Just War Theory states that Christians are permitted to wage war if the following critreia are met: 1.  War is the last resort. 2.  War is declared by a legitimate authority. 3.  The war is for a just cause, not for plunder. 4.  There must be a reasonable hope of success. 5.  The war must disciminate between combatants and non-combatants. 6.  The warring party must use the minimum amount of lethal force necessary to win (proportionality).  The first four criteria are the  jus ad bellum  criteria, the criteria for entering the war.  The last two criteria,  jus in bello , govern one's conduct during the war.  Since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, most debate has focused on the  jus ad bellum  criteria.  Has the failure to find weapons of mass destruction undermined the rationale for going to war?    But a couple of recent articles I've come across focus our attention on the  jus in bello  criteria.  Was the war waged in a just manner?  The Associated Press just released its investigation of civilian casualties in the Iraq War.  A survey of 60 of Iraq's 124 hospitals confirmed that 3,240 non-combatants died between March 20 and April 20.  More than that certainly perished.  We don't know how many.  Some died in the hospitals that the AP reporters didn't visit.  Others died and were buried without being processed at a medical center.    It is sobering that in the second installment of our "war on terrorism," the United States military, funded by American taxpayers, killed more innocent civilians than the 19 hijackers did on September 11, 2001.  Jean Bethke Elshtain has argued ( Commonweal , April 25, 2003) that the Just War Theory doesn't demand that states never kill innocent civilians when they wage war, just that they try their best to avoid civilian casualties.  Elshtain writes that the use of precision-guided munitions and the willingness of the military to "embed" 600 journalists in combat units demonstrates the military's commitment to meeting criterion #5 in the above list.  There's a world of difference, Elshtain and many others would argue, between trying to demolish an office building, and a bomb targeted at a tank going astray and demolishing an office building.  I wonder.  At the beginning of the 20th century the military to civilian kill ratio in wars was 9:1.  In a given conflict, nine soldiers died for every civilian who died.  100 years later, the ratio has roughly reversed itself.  In today's wars, on average, nine civilians die for every one soldier.   urlLink Robert Higgs  writes, "When US forces employ aerial and artillery bombardment--with huge, high explosive bombs, large rockets and shells, including cluster munitions--as their principle technique in waging war, especially in densely inhabited areas, they know with absolute certainty that many innocent people will be killed.  To proceed with such bombardment, therefore, is to choose to inflict those deaths."  In his book  Nevertheless , John Howard Yoder identifies nearly 20 forms of pacifism.  One form that the pacifist might take is that of the person who would support a war if it met the Just War criteria, but is in practice a pacifist because modern war simply can't be waged in a just manner.  More Christians ought to consider this position, given the New Testament's teaching on suffering love and the destructive nature of modern war.  I suppose that more could have been done to prevent civilian casualties in Iraq.  The military might have decided to dispense with aerial and artillery bombardment altogether and conquered Iraq one soldier at a time.  "Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes" might be a surer way to avoid civilian casualties than lobbing a cruise missile at a tank parked on a Baghdad cul-de-sac, even if the cruise missile is a "precision-guided weapon."  But fighting a war like that would vastly inflate the US death toll, and that is unacceptable to both the US military and the American people.    Elshtain is wrong.  When it gets down to it, avoiding US military casualties is far more important to everyone involved than preventing the deaths of innocent civilians.  As long as we Americans demand wars without body bags, our military will continue to sweep away the righteous with the wicked (Genesis 18: 23), and the guilt will be on our heads.

      Are wizards Carolina fans or State fans?  It's impossible to say for sure, but the Hogwarts curriculum does give us some clues.  Harry, Ron and Hermione's course work seems to come straight out of a land grant university's parallel universe.  They study animal science (Care of Magical Creatures with Hagrid), chemistry (Potions with Snape), and astronomy (Professor Trelawney's Divination class gives them a thorough grounding in astrology).  Hogwarts does not neglect the humanities entirely.  The History of Magic is a required course.  Alas, this worthy subject (the one in which I majored at N.C. State) is taught by a professor almost as boring as the history teacher Ben Stein played in  Ferris Bueller's Day Off .  Professor Binns also happens to be a ghost (what better creature to teach history?)  Aspiring wizards must also complete many writing assignments, but the writing is more technical than creative.  For instance, one might have to turn in two parchments on which spells ought not be mixed together on a particular subject at the same time.  So picture 15 or so young adult muggles in the parking lot of Carter-Finley stadium peering into telescopes.  Astronomy lab at NC State, in other words.  I'm not saying that these 15 are any more likely to discern a portent of disaster in the heavens than the muggles who attend that little liberal arts insitution 27 miles up highway 54.  Nor is it the case that if they looked to the east, they'd see unicorns prancing in the pasture surrounding the vet school.  But if Hogwarts ever decides to admit muggles (and today's Supreme Court ruling may force them to), it's clear where Professor Dumbledore ought to recruit.

      The weather turned--just in time for our vacation.  Sunday, the long, cool, wet spring finally gave way to summer.  Sunny, warm and humid.  I was a puddle of sweat wrestling the luggage into the car.  Ditto here at Oak Island, North Carolina.  Ninety degrees today.  No wind, except at the seashore.  It feels great in the surf.  Think I'll go eat lunch and take a nap.

      The new Harry Potter book is due out in a couple of weeks.  Just now I'm picking up the first one in the series.  There are nine-year-olds who've forgotten more about Harry Potter than I'll ever know.  I'm humbled.  What can I say about Harry Potter that hasn't already been said?  Probably nothing, so I'll simply report my first impressions.  It's not politically innocent fiction--no good fantasy story ever is.  Harry's evil relatives are mean, materialistic TV watchers.  Sound familiar?  If it's true that there is one Harry Potter book in print for every four Americans, do we realize that the joke's on us?  Now I'm wondering who the "wicked step-sisters" in Cinderella really were.  This text seems important in defining the moral vision of Harry Potter:   Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him.  Very strange strangers they were, too.  A tiny man in a violet top hat bowed to him once while he was out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley...  A wild-looking old woman dressed in all green had waved merrily at him once on a bus.  A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word.   The very strange (and scorned) among us are actually gifted with extraordinary powers.  Imagine:  every old fool muttering to himself has a flying broom in the closet at home; every bag lady can turn into a cat, and every picked on kid is a wizard in disguise.  Of all us earthen vessels, the cracked ones hold the greatest treasure.

      I'm almost ready to go on vacation.  We hate leaving a messy house, so Laura vacuumed and cleaned the bathrooms.  I straightened up the garden.  Out with the kale, lettuce and peas (and weeds).  In with the okra.    A sparkling countertop.  A freshly vacuumed carpet, fibers all lying in the same direction.  Freshly turned soil with nary a dandelion or stubborn piece of crabgrass.  All three are immensely satisfying.  Ethan, of his own volition, offered to help by hoeing around the squash.  He's becoming quite the gardener.  The other day I took him with me to the nursery.  The idea was nothing more than to give Laura a break; plus, I had just weeded a spot next to the wall, under the rose-of-sharon.  What it needed was a few impatiens.  But Ethan had his own ideas.  Some pink petunias caught his eye.  He insisted that we buy them.  So we added them to the purple impatiens I had selected.  We found a good location for them, a sunny, empty patch of dirt next to the corner of the house.  He dig the holes and planted the petunias.  That night we said prayers.  Ethan prayed for the petunias.  "God, please give my flowers lots of sun, and lots of rain, and make the rain good, clean water."  Thursday and Friday were sunny, and today's been a washout.  Who says that God doesn't answer prayers?  Ethan doesn't know the song, but he does know that "His eye is on the sparrow."

      "They haven't dug up any nerve gas canisters because they're too busy digging up bodies," my friend John explained to me.  A great retort, I have to admit.  (I can always count on John, whose antennae are particularly attuned to liberal hypocrisy and self-righteousness, to snap me back into line whenever I stray).  When we lament intelligence failures or outright lies that led up to the war against Iraq, aren't we in fact shedding tears for Saddam Hussein?  Some people can make this argument better than others.  If you were on the side of humanitarian interventions in the 1990s, then you can play that card.  Tom Friedman is a good example.  A liberal who's not reflexively against all Republican wars, Friedman supported the intervention in Kosovo and cautiously supported the war against Iraq, because it gave us an opportunity to bring democracy to a major Arab country.   But if you spent the last decade decrying "nation-building," then the fact that Saddam Hussein was an evil (that all-too-popular adjective) dictator ought to be of no consequence.  After all, you spent the last decade pointing out that the US can't be the world's policeman.  The world is full of thugs and dictators, you said.  We have to be pragmatic, you said, especially when the thugs rule a huge, emerging market, like China.  Limit military operations to the defense of vital US interests, you said.  Well, eight weeks after the fall of Baghdad, we still cannot find any weapons of mass destruction.  No threat to US vital interests.  If you're a foreign policy realist, you should be concerned.

       Five Big East schools  are suing the University of Miami and Boston College.  The suit alleges that these two schools, while publically professing fidelity to the Big East, engaged in secret talks with the ACC about leaving (and destroying) the Big East.  I think I'm going to start suing my parishioners who transfer to other congregations.

      "The truth will be revealed," President Bush assured the troops in Qatar.  Both he and Prime Minister Blair express confidence that somewhere, in all that sand, a canister or two of nerve gas is waiting to be unearthed.    Give Blair credit:  he's said that locating and destroying weapons of mass destruction in Iraq is paramount.  It was THE rationale for war.  No WMD, no rationale for war, and no credibility for the Blair government.  But on this side of the Atlantic, Bush's sycophants in the press are trying to lower expectations.   urlLink Kathleen Parker  writes,   We entered Iraq with Oz-like expectations, wide-eyed in search of a yellow brick road lined with happy Iraqis pointing to the brightly colored arrows, "Weapons of Mass Destruction Here!"   Did you hear that?  If you're disappointed that they haven't found anything yet, it's  your  fault.  But who raised your expectations to Oz-like levels?  Your government did.  The Bush administration told you and the world, in no uncertain terms, that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and war was the only way to disarm them.  It's the military that's expressed the most astonishment that nothing's turned up.  I read of one general who stated that his troops had gone through countless ammunition depots and other Iraqi military facilities, but had found nothing.  He confessed to being "surprised."  Those silly generals, off to see the WMD wizard.  Parker says, "Pay no mind to that man behind the curtain.  Pay no attention to the elephant in the living room.  Worry not that you might have been lied to by your government, or that, at the least, your government made a mountain out of a molehill."  Parker says that we ought to worry about where those weapons got to.  Ah, I see.  War's failure to locate and destroy WMD in Iraq becomes the justification for--more war.  War on Syria.  War on Iran.  In the car Tuesday, I heard an NPR guest report that the names of wars change over time.  For instance, few people referred to the Civil War as such between 1861 and 1865.  Northern newspapers called it, "The Rebellion," while southern papers called it "The War of Northern Aggression."    I can already see a new name taking shape for The War on Terror:  The Second Hundred Years War.

      Why "The Ivy Bush?"  It's the name of Samwise's father's pub in Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy.  I'm trying hard to become a hobbit.  Tolkien reports that hobbits have a passion for three things:  good food and drink, a good pipe, and well-tilled earth.    I do enjoy a good meal, especially when it features produce from my garden.    HOWEVER:  The garden in our back yard is not planted in especially well-tilled soil.  Muddy, sticky, Piedmont, North Carolina red clay.  It will take several years of digging compost into it before any self-respecting hobbit would deign to muddy up his hairy feet in it.  HOWEVER TWO:  The pipe is right out.  What to replace it with?  A good book, perhaps.  But that makes me less hobbit-like.  Hobbits are an insular breed.  If I recall correctly, they only read geneaological book--and not just anybody's family; it's gotta be their own.  News of events beyond their fair Shire was of little interest, except to keep the children awake at night with tales of dragons, goblins and the like.  Books open you up to new, far-away worlds.  Not necessarily a good thing in most hobbits' estimation.  Now in this respect most of us would desire to be less Hobbitish.  Americans have been escaping the smothering provincialism of the small town for well over a century now.  But is the big city, its crime (fueled in part by the very anonymity that makes the city so alluring), its noise, its pollution, its estrangement from nature, an improvement?  Is it an entirely good thing that through inventions like the web, we now know more about events in distant countries than events in the lives of our neighbors?  (Our neighbor to the right of our lot has lived next to us for three years, and we just recently had him over for dinner for the first time).   urlLink Wendell Berry  has argued in prose, poety and trenchant non-fiction, that we need more provincialism, not less.  We need to take a new interest in and responsibility for, our immediate neighborhood and community.  Raise your own food, or buy it from a local farmer's market.  Trade with neighborhood merchants.  Discover what's growing in the vacant lot down the street from you.  Recognize your contingency.  You are not a global citizen, you reside in a particular time and place, and you ought to take note of and responsibility for that time and place.  Clearly, I have a long way to go.  But this I do have in my favor:  I am short of stature and hairy of feet!

      While Ariel Sharon does the Nixon Goes to China shuffle, his army is cracking down on human rights activists in the occupied territories.  Case in point:  the  urlLink Christian Peacemaker Team (CPT)  delegation in Hebron.  The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) informed CPT that they could no longer move about in areas formerly controlled by the Palestinian Authority.  Nor could they come near Jewish settlements in the IDF areas.  This pretty much confines the CPTers to house arrest.  One has to wonder why a group of pacifists running around the Occupied Territories with pen, paper and cameras is so threatening to Israeli security.

        Teen Sex .   Now there's a topic worth pontificating on.  I haven't had a chance to write the word "salacious" since impeachment.  This morning's  urlLink Charlotte Observer  announced that some teenage girls are (gasp!) acting like boys, aggressively seeking sexual encounters with no emotional strings attached.  We all knew that, right?  These girls today--nothing but a bunch of freak dancin' hoochie mommas.  Except that the article went on to note that overall teen sexual behavior is down, from 55% to less than 50%.  The number of teen girls with four or more sexual partners is down from 18% to 14%.  But those mitigating factors were located on the other side of the jump.  So if teens are having less sex, why write an article trumpeting the few who are giving Sadie Hawkins a bad name?  You know the answer, Gentle Reader.  Sex sells.  Our article in question had seven instances of the phrase "oral sex," (a post-impeachment record?)  The banner on the front page advertizing the article featured two hot (like, soap opera hot) kids on the verge of attacking each other's lips.  (Although the article assured us, at least seven different times, that the sexual contact in question was not lip-to-lip.)  What would the graphics look like for a banner saying, "Teens abstaining from sex--See Living Section"?  Some wholesome, home-schooled girl in a gingham dress?  Yawn.  Well, the good news is that a lot of teenagers are getting the message--from parents, teachers, houses of worship, the difficult lives of older brothers and sisters--that delaying sexual activity is in their best interest.  No matter what MTV and BET are trying to tell them.  And no matter what The salacious Charlotte Observer is trying to tell you.

      Good evening.  This is my first attempt at web publishing, and already I have writer's block.  Shall I introduce myself?  No, not necessary.  It's still a private blog.  If you're reading this, it's because I've invited you to this site, right?  You know me, right?  Obviously I don't know much about this blogging thing.  Why a blog?  Ahh--Here's a good place to start.  I need to write again.  A couple of years ago I was a guest columnist for The Charlotte (NC) Observer.  A great opportunity to vent, put my thoughts into writing, disill them down to 750 words, talk about things important to me that few were talking about in the regional media.    But when my year came to an end, so did my writing forum.  That wasn't altogether bad.  In 2002 I chaired two community non-profit boards.  No time to write.  All those well-formed arguments, witticisms, snappy ripostes to the gobbleygook spewed out by politicians, preachers --stillborn.  Well no more.    I need to write again.  It's good for me.  And maybe reading my rants will be good for you too!

      At the end of the Clinton administration, the FBI created software called "Carnivore."  It's mission:  to chew up email texts flying through cyberspace, and flag the ones that contained suspicious words or phrases.    In the post-9/11 world we have the Patriot Act, which gives law enforcement authorities the right to examine your library records AND slap a gag order on the librarian, so that you'll never know that you were being investigated.  Add to that the bright ideas of a Defense Department  urlLink agency  that's designed to "think outside the box."  They've proposed culling through every document out there, from credit card receipts to medical records, looking for terrorist activity.  "Total Information Awareness" they called it.  Gives you that warm, fuzzy feeling, doesn't it?  Like reading an Orwell novel.  I'm wondering what combination of key words and dangerous books will flag me.  Is an email with the phrases "70 virgins" and "tomorrow is zero hour" plus an overdue Holy Qu'ran at the Rowan Public Library enough to land the pipe-puffing Admiral Poindexter on my front porch?  I think that I will experiment and let you know, unless of course, the "think outside the box" crowd boxes me up and ships me off to Guantanamo Bay before I can file my report.  In that case, it was nice bloggin' with ya!

      Today's blog is the first in a series of reflections on the Presbyterian Peacemaking Conference which I attended last week.  Rev. Mitri Raheb led evening worship on Tuesday and Wednesday.  The Palestinian pastor of an Evangelical Lutheran congregation in Bethlehem, Raheb's mere existence shatters a host of American Evangelical stereotypes about who the Palestinians are and what they're up to.  More about that later.  For now let me repeat one anecdote from his Tuesday evening sermon, and comment on what it says about the prospects for peacemaking in our day and age.  In December, 2001, the second infatada was in full swing.  Residents of Bethlehem hurried home each evening at 4:30 PM, because not long after dark the shooting would start.  People were sick and tired of being held hostage in their own homes, so Raheb and others decided to take back the night by holding a candlelight vigil.  Would anybody show up?  Raheb said that they figured on a crowd of maybe 500, but trying to be optimistic, they ordered enough candles for a thousand Palestinians.  In fact, 3,000 people turned out and braved the cold, darkness and flying bullets with nothing more than alighted candlesticks.  3,000 prayers for peace on earth, goodwill toward man in the City of David.  In advance of the vigil Rev. Raheb contacted over 2,000 journalists in Israel and Palestine.  Only three reporters showed up.  The next day, Rev. Raheb called the nearest BBC office to inquire why they didn't deign to cover this latest mass demonstration in the Occupied Territories.  "There's just not much interest in peaceful demonstrations," they told him.  The old saw "If it bleeds it leads" is not only true of your local TV news but also of the venerable British Broadcasting Corporation, and most media.  The examples are endless.  The media embedded reporters in the Third Infantry Division, but has any TV network thought of embedding reporters in a battered women's shelter?  Or what about imbedding journalists in the mediation process that judges ask separated couples to go through in order to avoid costly and gutwrenching divorce court proceedings?  If we all profess to dislike violence, why is it so much more interesting?  I suspect that violent situations capture our imagination because they bring out the best and worst in us.  The best:  courage, self-sacrifice.  The worst:  cowardice, brutality.    Yet nonviolent methods of conflict resolution can also offer us opportunities to be brave, and even to lay down our lives for our friends.  "What requires more bravery?"  Rev. Raheb asked some students in advance of the vigil, "To throw a stone at an Israeli tank or to light a candle?"  They were unanimous.  "Throwing stones."  To which he replied, "Very well, then.  I want to see you on the square this coming weekend for our candlelight vigil."  But the kids begged off.  "Our parents won't let us.  It's too dangerous."  It's a poverty of imagination that renders so many nonviolent efforts to establish justice stillborn.  We can name far more generals than we can pacifists.  In textbooks and lectures, American history is often taught as the history of war.  We begin with the Revolution, and go on through the Civil War, and World Wars I and II.  It's rarely told as the story of the Underground Railroad, the labor movement, the suffrage movement, and the Civil Rights movement.  And so we come, ignorant and lacking creativity, to a conflict, a threat or an injustice of some kind, and in our stupor we conclude that violence is our only option.  We need to listen to the B side of history.  We must leave no stone unturned looking for the stories that our media won't show us, stories of courage, bravery, resistance against evil, and self-sacrifice by people who exemplified these virtues without drawing the sword.  In a world of nuclear proliferation, terrorism, gun violence, domestic violence, disease and poverty, how can we afford not to?

      Yippee!  Me and my  urlLink rechargeable lawnmower  are off the ethical/environmental hook.  Starting today, my utility, Duke Power, is offering blocks of  urlLink "green power"  to its customers.  $4.00 per month will buy you 100 kilowatt hours of electricity generated by solar power, windmills or other clean forms of power production.  That's more than enough to make the little light on my mower go from green to red.  Mowing with integrity, for only four bucks per month.  Amazing how cheap a clear conscience comes these days!

      If yesterday's blog on nonviolence piqued your interest, read today's Charlotte Observer op-ed page.  Richard Falk  urlLink reviews  a new book by Jonathan Schell titled "The Unconquerable World:  Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the People."  A summary:  Shell, a celebrated Vietnam War coorespondent and disarmament expert, argues that the combination of nuclear proliferation and "people's war" has rendered war as a tool of statecraft obsolete.  To go forward, we must learn lessons from history that have tended to go overlooked--the power of nonviolent social change movements to correct injustices (the Glorious Revolution, the fall of the Berlin War, the relatively bloodless collapse of the Apartheid system in South Africa).

      Blogging will slow down this week.  I'm off to  urlLink Montreat , in the North Carolina mountains, to attend the Presbyterian Peacemaking Conference.  This year's theme is  urlLink "A Force More Powerful:  Embracing Jesus' Way of Nonviolence."   The brochure states:    When confronted by conflict, whether personal or global, our natural human response is to fight or take flight.  Jesus offers a third opton:  standing one's ground and responding with active nonviolence.    Although pacifists are few in number, there are an almost infinite variety of them.  The conference keynoter,  urlLink Walter Wink , combines his exegesis of New Testament texts like the Sermon on the Mount with Jungian psychology and analysis of nonviolent social change movements to create a distinctive form of pacifism that is, well, militant.  Christian nonviolence is a legitimate way of challenging evil regimes and protecting the innocent.    Wink's muscular, optimistic pacifism seems different than  urlLink Stanley Hauerwas' .  Hauerwas, deeply influenced by the Mennonite scholar  urlLink John Howard Yoder , argues that God has redeemed the world with a cross and not a sword, and that a faithful witness to that redeeming work requires Christians to renounce violence.  Hauerwas says repeatedly that pacifism is not a strategy for getting your way by nonlethal means, a way of having your cake and eating it too.  It's a prayer for the kingdom to come, and a living (and dying) acknowledgement that only God can build the kingdom.  I'd like to get the two of them in a room and listen to them hash it out.  It may be the case that I've overemphasized their differences.    But mostly, I'm going to the conference to find out what it means to live a lifestyle of Christian nonviolence.  Surely it means more than, here and there, questioning the wisdom of the Iraq War.  For me it has a lot to do with parenting my oldest son.  He has autism, and can be quite violent, quite unexpectedly.  How do I not react violently to his aggressive behavior?  How can I be the kind of parent that he needs me to be in order for him to thrive?  I'll let you know what I find out.  I'm also going to do a little hiking, a little splashing in cold mountain streams, and a little relaxing.

      A week ago, at the memorial service for our  urlLink RAIN  Team Care Partner, the choir sang, "He's an On-Time God."  He certainly has been "on-time" with the rain this year.  I pulled into the driveway yesterday and noticed that the black-eyed susans huddling around the mailbox were a little droopy.  Then, Bang!  Thunderstorm.  Sheets of rain that blew left, then right.  Just in time.  Thank you.

      We and our neighbors are co-hosting a dinner party to benefit the Rowan County AIDS Task Force.  It's Saturday, August 23.  There are going to be dinner parties throughout Salisbury and Rowan County that evening.  Participants will gather at the Waterworks Gallery afterward for drinks and entertainment.    We had a ball last year, and we're looking forward to doing it again.  Our '02 party had a Cajun theme, complete with Jimmy Hood's Comeback Sauce and "Cajun Trivia."  Our neighbors' theme was "Finding Bobby Fisher."  This year we've joined forces to put on a dinner with a Harry Potter theme.  Muggle or wizard attire is acceptable.  We're trying to invite as many people as we can think of who are 1. Interested in supporting the AIDS Task Force, 2. Interested in getting together with a bunch of folks on a Saturday night in August, or 3. Can't get enough of Harry Potter.  If you fall into one of these three categories, email me, and we'll be sure to mail you an invitation.

      Democrats are making hay over the whopping $450 billion federal deficit.  Shame on them.  Thee's nothing wrong with running a deficit in tough economic times.  Should the government really be racking up surplus tax revenue at a time when millions of people are losing their jobs?  Good ol' John Maynard Keynes taught us that the government can use fiscal policy to steer the economy between the rock of recession and the hard place of inflation.  When the economy slows, the government ought to prime the pump with deficit spending.  Later, when the economy heats up, the government can tap the breaks by raising taxes and cutting spending.  Democrats to a person are Keynesians.  Their carping about the deficit is disingenuous.  It's also poor politics.  The deficit is not a viable campaign issue.  Just ask deficit hawks Walter Mondale, Paul Tsongas and Ross Perot.    The real issue, from a policy and a political perspective, is where the red ink is flowing.  Democrats ought to contend that instead of giving the surplus back to the wealthy in the form of tax cuts, the surplus ought to have been spent on, well... you name it.  Bailing out cash-strapped states.  A real prescription drug benefit for senior citizens.  Making affordable health care insurance available to more Americans.    Do us a favor, Democrats, and give us a national debate on the best way to stimulate the economy.  It's either the President's way, cutting taxes to spur investment, or your way, increased spending on social programs like health care and education.  But let's have a real debate over real issues, not political hay-making.

      Once again, UNC-Chapel Hill has asked its incoming freshmen to  urlLink read a book and talk about it .  Once again, somebody's feelings have gotten hurt.  Last year the UNC chieftans asked the first-years to read a book about the  urlLink Qu'ran .  Some Tarheel fundamentalists sued their university, arguing that the assignment amounted to "religious indoctrination" and violated their right to freedom of religion.  An incredible argument on the face of it--religious indoctrination in Orange County, the reputed epicenter of NC-style secular humanism?    This year the freshmen have to read and discuss  Nickel and Dimed:  On (Not) Getting By in America,  by Barbara Ehrenreich.  Politically conservative students and their supporters in the press complain that the book is an extremist attack on the U.S. free enterprise system.  In the July 14  Salisbury Post , John Hood of the John Locke Foundation said that assigning this book is but one example of  UNC's liberal bias.  At Carolina you don't get a liberal education in the classic sense; you get a capital L liberal education.  The upset students want a book that presents a more "balanced" perspective.  From Mullahs to Marxists, a "startling metamorphosis" for the UNC faculty, if I may quote the old TV show that Hollywood turned into a summer blockbuster.  Especially startling considering all that bad blood between the Mullahs and the Marxists after that unpleasantness in Afghanistan.  But I disgress.  Let's ask ourselves two questions:  Is Hood correct to assert that UNC-Chapel Hill is overgrown with leftists? and, Is Ehrenreich's book really  The Communist Manifesto  for a new generation?  Question One:  Is Carolina a liberal place?  Hood certainly thinks so.  He asserts that the faculty is "overwhelmingly left wing," and calls the administration a bunch of "left-wing bigots."    But is it true?  I have no idea.  And how does Hood know?  Has he polled the UNC faculty on their party affiliation or how they voted in recent elections?  It's an unsubstantiated allegation.  Are we to believe, for instance, that the MDs on the faculty of the Carolina medical school are a hair to the right of Lenin and Marx?  Doctors make good money, and the wealthy tend to vote for Republicans.  And there's no constituency cheering harder for the GOP's latest cause celebre, tort reform, than physicians.  But suppose there are a lot of liberals teaching at Chapel Hill.  How does one's voting record affect your teaching of a subject like organic chemistry?  Or differential equations?  Heck, the whole math department at Carolina could have voted for Ralph Nader in 2000, and the math majors could sail through the university unruffled by such extremist ideas as, "We shouldn't start wars," or "Corporations that pollute the environment ought to bear the cost of cleaning it up."  (Wait, wait, don't tell me... The math department sneaks it in with word problems!  "If a train loaded with supply side economists going 60 miles per hour collides head-on with a train packed with pro-life activists going 120 miles per hour...")  Let's suppose even further that the humanties and social sciences are infested with graying hippies who still refer to police as pigs and can't let go of the fact that we bombed Cambodia.  True, they might use a strained interpretation of  Jane Eyre  to promote a "radical feminist" agenda.  They might take pot shots at President Bush in the Intro to Political Science course.    On the other hand, they might be commited to a liberal education in the lower case l sense of the word.  They might strive, above all, to get their students to think hard about all points of view, and to be able to make a logical, factual, compelling case for their own perspective, whatever it is.  I don't know any UNC profs, but I know a few at my hometown college,  urlLink Catawba .  They fit the latter category much better than the caricature that Hood paints.  On to Question Number Two:  How bad is  Nickel and Dimed ?  I don't know.  I haven't read the book.  We don't know if Hood has read the book either.  He spills a lot of ink insulting the Chapel Hill faculty, but none at all over the content of  Nickel and Dimed .  Just what does Ehrenreich say that's outrageous enough to make tender, right-wing ears tingle?  I haven't read the book, but I've read a few reviews of  Nickel and Dimed .  (That's the difference between seminary and the parish.  In seminary, you read books.  In the parish you read book reviews).    From Lillian Daniel's review in the August 1-8, 2001  Christian Century , I learned that Ehrenreich "went undercover" in the world of the working poor.  For three years she lived the life of a waitress or a discount store employee.  She documents how hard it is to find housing on a minimum wage salary, how easy it is to become obese when you're poor and the local food pantry loads you up with Rice Krispies and bags of candy, and how humiliating it can be for women in their 50s to wait tables under the supervision of 20-something men who strictly enforce a limit of six croutons per salad.  Simply casting light on people like this is probably enough to raise the hackles of some on the far right, who, in their gated communities, prefer to live in blissful ignorance of lower class Americans.  But the author quits preachin' and goes to meddlin' when she dares to suggest that the "gubmunt" might have a roll to play in alleviating their suffering.  A living wage, subsidized child care and universal health insurance is the ticket, not faith-based initiatives.  Ehrenreich is highly critical of the churches where Jesus is worshipped in theory, but goes unrecognized in "the least of these."  Daniel's review is enough to convince me that  Nickel and Dimed  is a book worth reading.  I'll get around to it eventually.  I won't agree with everything in the book, I'm sure.  In 1996 I was disappointed that President Clinton signed the Welfare Reform Bill into law.  Today, I've changed my mind.  Our congregation has a  urlLink ministry to people suffering from AIDS .  After three years of involvement with one indigent family through that ministry, I can see the value in limiting direct cash assistance, and tying it to education, retraining, and other initiatives.  I can also see that Christians, even well-meaning ones who set up good programs, can only do so much to lift the poor out of poverty.  Doing justice and loving mercy is the task of the state as well as the church.  Hood calls the reading assignment illiberal, an example of the UNC faculty pushing a narrow, partisan political agenda.  This is the pot calling the kettle black.  Not wanting to confront a point of view that you disagree with is the height of illiberalism.  If the students' political views are so fragile that they can't stand up to one portrait of the working poor in modern America, maybe they aren't worth having.  Read the book, and tell your classmates why Ehrenreich's wrong.  Tell us why the working poor are lucky to live in America.  Tell us why a living wage is bad public policy.  Or go to Liberty University.  Either way, stop your whining.

      Knight Ridder reporters Jonathan S. Landay and Warren P. Strobel have composed a devastating indictment of the management of post-war Iraq.  According to the  urlLink article , which ran in newspapers in Charlotte, San Jose, Kansas City and elsewhere Saturday, the neo-con cabal that planned the Iraq War, led by Mr. Rumsfeld and Miss Rice, had no plan for administering the country after the war ended.  Their "plan," such as it was, was to hand over the nation to Iraqi exile leader and convicted felon Ahmad Chalabi, after jubilant Iraqis threw the Third Armored Division a ticker tape parade in the streets of Baghdad.  Nor did they have a back-up plan if Plan A (such as it was) failed to materialize.  Fail to materialize it did.  Ordinary Iraqis have given a muted reception to American troops.  Chalabi lacked credibility with his compatriots, and even with President Bush.  In the absence of a plan, the country has descended into chaos.  72 days after the President landed on an aircraft carrier to declare the war over, American forces are battling a well-organized insurgency.  Looters rule the evening hours in Iraq.    It could have been different.  Landay and Strobel report that the State Department labored eight months on a plan to rebuild post-war Iraq.  The "Future of Iraq" project dealt with everything from restoring a working judicial system, to restoring wetlands that the Saddam regime had drained.  But the Chicken Hawks refused to let the plan see the light of day.  I used to think that President Bush, who was openly contemptuous of "nation-building" in the 2000 election campaign, had been dragged, kicking and screaming, into nation-building by the events of the past two years.  In fact, he remains streadfast in his opposition to the concept.  There's no nation-building going on in Iraq, and not much in Afghanistan.   But "nation-destroying"--now that's another matter altogether.  Bush and his neo-con underlings seem to think that if we're just brutal enough against our enemies, then everything will fall into place, for the good of us and our friends.  They are quite wrong, and the people who are paying the price for it are ordinary Iraqis whom we liberated from Saddam only to hand them over to the looters, and the Army wives at Fort Stewart wondering when and if their husbands will return.  In the 1990s we had two choices in foreign policy:  Pat Buchanan's non-interventionism, and a neo-Wilsonian interventionism embraced by the Clinton administration's Lake and Albright.  Each has its drawbacks.  The former risks letting problems get out of control.  It fails to understand that in a global, wired economy, the U.S. is no longer an island apart.  The latter courts arrogance and over-reaching.  Can we really impose our values on other countries and different cultures?  Can we really be the world's policeman?    But both seem preferable to the Bull in a China Shop foreign policy that the current President is implementing.  As to this third option, a quote from the Roman historian Tacitus which panned his era's famed  Pax Romana  seems in order:    They made a desolation, and called it peace.

       Cheap shot of the week :  Why is it that when Bill Clinton lies, he has to go on national TV to admit it, but when George W. Bush lies, he can fess up through his press secretary?  After all, nobody got killed when Bill Clinton lied about his affair with Monica Lewinski.  I'm surprised at the dustup over Bush's fib that the Iraqis tried to buy nuclear material from Niger.  We've known about this for months.  (Some of us have.)  The administration trotted out that piece of propoganda before the State of the Union address, and Hans Blix refuted it.  Then Bush reiterated the bogus claim in his State of the Union address.  The reporters at NPR dutifully pointed out that Bush was building a case for war with discredited evidence, but I guess most people were too busy watching American Idol.    Is your Blogger engaged in unseemly Monday morning quarterbacking?  No; the point is this:  a doctrine of pre-emptive war requires perfect intelligence and truthful leaders.  We seem to be lacking both.  Just War Theory recognizes that rulers are fallible and sinful; that's why it demands that if war is to be waged, it be the last resort.  So let us learn our lesson, and exchange the pre-emption doctrine for something more... Christian.

      Days like today are why I want to move to northern California and start an asperagus farm.  It's brutally hot outside.  The sunshine is relentless.  It bores through the flimsy shade that my hat casts over my eyebrows and neck.  And I HAVE to be out there.  All the rain we've had, plus taking off for two weeks in June equals a backyard that is reverting back to the wild fontier.  The mower is something of a disappointment.  The charge ran out after I'd only done half of the front yard.  So for the second half I returned to old, green faithful.  Maybe I didn't properly charge it to begin with.  When I'm exhausted I look at my corn for inspiration.  It's tall and covered with pole beans, and some of the cobs are just about ready to pick.  I'm so proud of myself!  My first try at corn, and it looks like it's going to be a bumper crop!    So now I'm inside, cooling off, and wondering (as I do every summer) why we don't starve in the winter.  How do we put up with it in February?  No fresh beans lightly steamed.  No juicy tomatoes.  No crisp cukes?  I suppose the July dinner plate's more than enough compensation for the July weather.

      More on  urlLink gay marriage :  Newsweek subscribers are reflecting on the irony of recent back-to-back cover stories on sex and marriage.  The  urlLink July 7  edition asked, "Is Gay Marriage Next?" and featured a photo of a homosexual couple.  According to the article, the broad sweep of the Supreme Court decision overturning anti-sodomy laws makes inevitable all sorts of legal challenges to laws restricting marriage to hetersexuals.    But the  urlLink June 30  cover announced, "No Sex, Please, We're Married."  It featured a man and a woman sitting in bed.  The man's face, bathed in the blue glow of a laptop computer screen, is etched with tension.  The woman, food in hand, looks glumly at the camera.  The cover story claims that married people are just too busy, too tired and too doped up on anti-depressants to have marital relations.    Did the happy homosexuals on the July 7 cover read the previous Newsweek?  If so, maybe they're reconsidering that lawsuit to get married.  Gays and lesbians be warned:  if you walk down that aisle, before you know it, you'll have no time or energy for... well, let's be frank about it... SODOMY.  This Supreme Court's more conservative, and sneekier than most people recognize--getting rid of sodomy with soccer practice and Zoloft rather than police raids.  The vast right wing conspiracy keeps rolling along.

      I'm having second thoughts about that  urlLink lawn mower  after reading this morning's lead editorial in  urlLink The Charlotte Observer .  There are competing bills in Congress that would impose new regulations on power plant emissions--the Bush administration's so-called "Clean Skies Initiative," and a bill sponsored by a senator from Delaware.  Bush's EPA did a study, and it turns out that their bill is the poorer of the two.  The Congressional bill would reduce pollutants across the board for a minimal cost, and generate billions of dollars in health care savings.  Naturally, the EPA squelched the results.  The Republican Party seems almost reflexively anti-environment.  Even when the data are staring them straight in the face, they find some way to stick their heads in the sand.  Consider the evolution of the global warming debate.  When scientists first proposed that human activity was warming up the earth, they said, "Global warming isn't happening."  When more data confirmed the original hypothesis, they said, "OK, the earth is warming up, but for natural reasons, not because of pollution."  Still more data was brought forward.  Now they say, "Yes, global warming is happening, and it's being caused by us, but it's not so bad.  Why, one day people in Minnesota will grow lemons.  Yippee!"  It wasn't always this way.  The greatest environmental politician of the last century, Theodore Roosevelt, was a Republican.  TR created a slew of national parks and was an avid outdoorsman.  It was Richard Nixon, of all people, who founded the very government agency that's trying to run away from its own findings about how to best clean up the air.    Environmentalism and the GOP ought to be fast friends.  Genuine conservatives want to   conserve  ; they want to preserve precious resources and time-tested institutions and mores.  When it comes to the environment, conservatism equals conservation, preserving clean air and water, scenic places, rare animal and plant life.    Genuine conservatives also want the free market to work.  Most pollution today is, in economic terms, an externality, one company unfairly passing the cost of doing business off to someone else.  Forcing utilities to clean up their emissions simply ensures that the people who create the pollution bear the economic cost, rather than children with asthma whose parents must pay for medication and doctor's visits.  Free markets need the rule of law expressed in the regulatory power of governmental agencies like the EPA.  But there are few genuine conservatives in the Republican Party at the national level.  Folks like Dick Cheney and Tom deLay think that the government is the enemy of free markets.  That's a libertarian mindset, not a conservative one.  And it's plain wrong.  Just look at Russia, where crony capitalism flourishes underneath a weak federal government.    So perhaps I will plug away with my reel mower.  After all, is it "liberal" or "conservative" to maintain my lawn with an old fashioned mower that requires some physical exertion on the part of its user, but requires little if any money to be spent on upkeep?

      One more (important) reason why I'm going to take the electric mower off of my friend's hands:  my wife has said, on more than one occasion, that when I die, the first thing she's going to do is run out and buy a normal lawn mower.  So getting the mower is part of an overall plan to put my affairs in order:  write a will, pay up on the insurance policy, get a lawn mower for the 21st century, etc.  Just one less thing for her to worry about.  Thank goodness she didn't say that the first thing she'd do is run out and get another husband.  I'd feel awkward lining that up in advance.

      A friend's generosity has put me in an ethical quandry.  She wants to give me her old lawnmover, an eco-friendly, rechargeable, electric mower.  The problem is that I've already got an eco-friendly mower, the friendliest of them all--a reel mower that runs on Marvin power.  I'm tempted to accept the gift.  With the reel mower I must cut the grass twice a week, especially when it's wet (and boy has it been wet this year!)  My kind of mower simply can't catch tall grass between its teeth.  The electric mower, like its gas-powered cousin, can whack back even the tallest grass with its motorized blade.  It would be nice to mow only one day out of seven.  So what's the hang-up?  The electric mower does rely on power generated by the burning of fossil fuels.  They're burned in power plants which are cleaner than gas-powered movers belching blue smoke, but still, some environmental damage is being done.  Nevertheless, I will probably give the forlorn electric mower a home.  It's too convenient to pass up.  I'm sliding fast down that slippery slope.  I used to be a vegetarian; now I eat fish occasionally.  (I need those Omega 3 fatty acids, I rationalize to myself.)  Now I'm going to soil my hands with a polluting lawn-care device.  I hope y'all will still talk to me in a few years when I've hit bottom, stuffing a Big Mac in my mouth while the Husqvarna underneath me feasts on a third of an acre of lush, green ChemLawn fescue.

       Gay marriage  is back in the news after the Supreme Court struck down anti-sodomy laws in a host of states.  Both sides predict that the high court's decision will pave the way for legal challenges to laws that define marriage as a union of a man and a woman.  This takes me back a dozen summers to when the Presbyterian Church's General Assembly debated and rejected a controversial study of human sexuality titled "Keeping Body and Soul Together."  The paper argued that justice and love, not a marriage license, are the marks of a good sexual relationship.  It called for greater tolerance of homosexuality, and civil recognition of gay and lesbian relationships.  Much that is wrong with gay and lesbian sexual behavior, argued the paper, is attributable to the fierce prejudice against homosexuals in our society.  That prejudice forces gays and lesbians underground--hence the high rates of promiscuity and sexually transmitted diseases in that community.  The report and its authors were pilloried, and not only by the right.  Feminist fatale Camille Paglia complained about the   conservatism   of the Sexuality Report.  "You nit-wits," she said, in effect, "Gays don't have sex with each other in bathroom stalls because they're oppressed.  They do it there because it's fun!  Stop trying to turn homosexuals into Ozzie and Harriet!"  I have no personal experience with bathroom stall sex, so who am I to referee this dispute?  But Paglia is right about one thing:  the liberal authors of "Keeping Body and Soul Together" made, unwittingly perhaps, a very conservative argument when they asserted that opening  marriage up to gays would generate more monogamous, loving sexual behavior among homosexuals.  Marriage, it turns out, is not just a piece of paper after all.  So if marriage is a commendable arrangement for gays and lesbians, what about heterosexuals?  Why is it that many on the left who are all for gay marriage tend to shrug their shoulders when it comes to divorce and serial co-habitation in the straight community?  What's good for the geese and the ganders is good for the...  Well, you know what I mean.

       Calling all Philistines !  Take note of the  urlLink controversy over the new MLK statue  in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.  Some citizens have complained that the statue doesn't look at all like the slain Civil Rights leader.  The artist, Erik Blome, insists that he poured his heart and soul into the work.  Blome challenges anyone who dislikes the statue to  create something that looks better.  So the gauntlet has been thrown down.  If you've ever been in an art museum and grunted, "You call that art?  My second grader can make better art than that!" then don't let me catch you grilling hamburgers or waxing your SUV over the holiday weekend.  I want to see you, chisel in hand, wrestling the image of Ebenezer Baptist Church's most famous pastor out of a slab of granite.

      Last night I finally watched  urlLink The Chamber of Secrets , and this morning I finished  urlLink The Order of the Phoenix .  I'm liking the story more and more, and the movies less and less.  What's the matter with the movies?  The kids can't act.  Now, some of you will disagree.  Others will be offended, as if I've insulted Harry, Hermione and Ron themselves by criticizing the actors who play them.  I'm not, and even if I were, it's worth remembering that they're   fictional characters  , not your friends.  But I digress.  The kids can't act.  In the books, the dialogue snaps, crackles and pops.  In the movies, it falls flat.  Like soggy Rice Krispies.  I know that Hermione's supposed to be an egghead, but if you're playing her role, that doesn't mean delivering her lines as if you're reading from a script right in front of you.  At times, it's as if one actor is looking away from the script as the other one finishes a line.  The pickup is a half second off.  The kids also fail where there is no dialogue.  Frequently the movie introduces us muggle viewers to a new magical creature/spell/instrument by first showing us Harry's wordless reaction to it.  But Harry's face is a blank slate when it ought to be the picture of fear, delight or wonder.   urlLink Daniel Radcliffe's  not any relation to  urlLink Keanu Reeves , is he?  The adult actors are much better.  That guy who plays  urlLink Filch  is amazing.  He can communicate this absolutely horrible mixture of meanness and emotional instability simply by raising an eyebrow and setting his jaw a certain way.  Of course child actors aren't as skilled as their grownup colleagues.  They haven't the years of experience.  But the movies would have been better had talent rather than looks been the determining factor at the audition.

      I'm departing from the  urlLink lectionary  this summer to preach a sermon series on the  urlLink Apostles' Creed .  This post will give you a brief introduction to the creed.  Although the Apostles' Creed was not written by one of the twelve apostles, it's a very early Christian confession of faith.  Some form of the creed may have been in use in congregations in the western Roman Empire in the second century.    The creed follows a Trinitarian format.  It treats God the Father first, followed by a longer section on Jesus Christ, and wraps up with a statement on the Holy Spirit, under which is subsumed several clauses about the life and mission of the church.  One reason why Christians have written creeds is to refute false doctrines.  The Apostles' Creed is no exception.  In contrast to Marcion, who taught that Jesus revealed a new, more loving God than the inferior, vengeful God of the Old Testament, the Apostles' Creed emphasizes that the same God who made heaven and earth as recorded in the Jewish scriptures is also the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.    Marcionism remains a stubborn heresy.  It crops up whenever Christians make disparaging comments about the Old Testament in general or the God revealed therein.  In fact, Jesus talks a lot more about hell than any Old Testament prophet of doom, and the Old Testament extolls God's "steadfast love" just as much as the New Testament does.  The Apostles' Creed also refuted the teachings of the Gnostics.  Gnosticism was a decentralized, pan-religious/philosophical movement in late antiquity.  What troubled orthodox Christians about Gnosticism was its elitism and its contempt for the body.  Gnostics believed that by being initiated into the mysteries offered by enlightened teachers, one could escape the confines of the material world and achieve unity with the divine Spirit.  The Apostles' Creed opposed this religious vision in a number of ways.  It affirmed the goodness of creation by confessing that God was maker of heaven and earth.  It also insisted that Jesus Christ was a real human being from start to finish.  He had a human mother, Mary.  Jesus had a real human body that suffered, died and was buried, thus experiencing corruption.  He was not a purely divine being who blew through the world for a while and escaped unscathed.  The Creed also contains a clause on  the resurrection of the body.  What orthodox Christians hope for is not an escape from the body, but the transformation of the body.   The Apostles' Creed is also bears witness to an egalitarian faith, not an elitist one.  The creed is short.  Anyone can memorize it.  If you believe it, you're in.  There's no secondary, esoteric wisdom beyond what's in the creed that sets apart "serious" Christians from the rest of the pack.  Gnosticism continues to pose a threat to orthodox Christianity.  Christians who turn a blind eye to the destruction of the environment, or Christians who care only about the salvation of people's souls, neglecting to care for their bodies (especially the bodies of the poor, the imprisoned, the disabled and the sick) need to hear the Creed again with fresh ears.  As for elitism, well, the examples of that are too numerous to mention.    A colleague of mine likens the Creed to the sidelines of a football field, or the foul poles in a baseball park.  The Creed does define some ideas as "out of bounds," but within the Creed there's a lot of fair territory to exploit.  A baseball player can get on with a screaming line drive, a bunt up the third base line, or a flair that drops just over the head of the shortstop.  While Lutherans have tended to regard Catholics as out of bounds, and Presbyterians have worried that Anglicans are drifting over into foul territory, perhaps it's more the case that we're all finding a different way to reach base and score within the same fair territory.

       urlLink Here is an absolutely terrible article by George Will  on Democratic Presidential hopeful Howard Dean, and potential challenger, General Wesley Clark.  The allegedly erudite Will complains that Dean is arrogant and condescending, and Clark is a toy soldier, having played war in the skies over Kosovo in 1999.  It's a hatchet job worthy of some talk radio ranter, dressed up in Will's polysyllabic prose.  We're already seeing the media's take on the 2004 election, and they're leading  with, "Howard Dean is mean.  Too mean to be President."  They gave us similarly deep analysis in the last election cycle when the story was "Stupid Bush versus Gore the Bore."  I don't care if Howard Dean is mean, and I don't care if he comes across as mean, and nobody else should.  Tell me where Howard Dean stands on the issues.  Tell me what George W. Bush has accomplished, and where, arguably, he's failed.  Don't tell me that John Edwards is too young and pretty to be President, or that John Kerry is all Gore without the personailty.

      President Bush returned to the White House from a month's vacation at his Texas ranch.  Did a few weeks in the Lone Star sagebrush render Dubya one with God's good creation?  Judging by the record, the answer is No Way.  In the past week Bush's EPA relaxed clean air standards for power plants.  Utilities may renovate old, dirty power plants without having to bring them into compliance with new clean air standards as long as the renovations don't total more than 20% of the facility's worth per year.  In other words, a utility that owns a power plant valued at $500 million can do $100 million worth of work annually on said facility without having to upgrade it's pollution control devices.  All the EPA's done is to allow utilities to build brand new power plants that comply with ancient pollution standards so long as they do it in slow motion.  What's next?  Let the auto makers build cars that run on leaded gasoline?  But that's not all.  It turns out that in the days after the attacks on the World Trade Center, the White House cut data from EPA reports on air quality in lower Manhattan.  The data were bad.  The revised report made it appear as though the air surrounding the Trade Center site was safer than it really was.  Reason?  "National security."    Mind-boggling, especially given the Chicken Little warnings that occasionally come forth from the Bush administration, the "Code Orange alerts."  When the White House has real data on real dangers, it quashes it.  When it has God-knows-what, we get Code Orange and warnings from the Homeland Security Director to "Be vigilant."  What does that mean anyway?  Look real hard at the clerk at the Stop 'N' Go?  On the other hand, if the White House had told people, "The air in lower Manhattan is dangerous to breathe, and this is what you can do about it," that would have been a truly helpful terrorist advisory.  Last, but not least, the EPA decided that it can't regulate carbon dioxide emissions, because the Supreme Court told the Clinton EPA it couldn't regulate tobacco.  CO2 is the chief cause of global warming.  Not that they would do anything if they could.  The only people left who don't believe global warming is happening spent the last month frying under a Texas-sized sun.  I guess they want everybody to have that August-in-Texas experience.   It's super-duper that the President is an outdoorsman.  So was the great Republican chief executive at the start of the last century, Theodore Roosevelt.  Unlike TR, this President won't do anything substantively to protect the outdoors he loves.  Bush's love of the outdoors is pure sentimentalism.

      I have worked on Sunday's sermon all week.  I read Karl Barth's chapters on "Suffered Under Pontius Pilate" and "Crucified, Dead and Buried," in his little volume on the Apostles' Creed titled  Dogmatics in Outline .  I read the same chapters in Lochman's commentary on the Creed.    I exegeted the scripture passages.  John's account of the crucifixion really plays up Pilate's cynical manipulation of the seething Priests.  I reflected on the new epistemology that Paul puts forth in First Corinthians 1: 18-25 (epistemology is a big word for how it is that we know things to be true).  "Since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, God decided, through the foolishness of our proclamation, to save those who believe."  I read Calvin's commentary on that text, and came away a bit disappointed.  Luther surely would have done better, as he used 1 Corinthians 1 in the Heidelberg Disputation to whip the scholastic theologians who thought that we could ascend to God through studying what is beautiful and good in creation rather than descend into hell with Christ.  What do I have to show for all this work?  Nothing.  Zip.  Zilch.  There's not one word on  paper yet.  The writer's block is crippling this week.  Why?  I'm freezing up before this huge topic--the cross--just like I freeze up every Holy Week, trying to come up with something to say about the resurrection.  Good Friday and Easter need a lifetime of preaching.  Indeed, if any sermon isn't about Good Friday and Easter in some sort of way, it isn't a sermon.  It might be a fine speech, but not a proclamation of the Word of God.  I'm feeling the pressure to cover all the bases in one sermon, and that can't be done.    But God gave me a clue about how to narrow things down.  I came home yesterday feeling hot, tired and surly.  I was changing clothes in the bedroom when from behind me Ethan blurted out, "Daddy, nothing can separate you from God's love."  He was holding a little wooden cross up to me, which he'd grabbed off a shelf.  Every night we have a devotion time with the kids, and we close it by making the sign of the cross on their foreheads.  When they ask us what that means, we say, "It means that nothing can separate you from God's love."  So Ethan was saying back to me what we've been saying to him most every night.  I still haven't written my sermon yet, but when I get up early Sunday to do it, you can bet that I'll say something about God's love for us in the crucifixion of Jesus.  That Friday was Good after all.

      Oh, how I loathe the culture wars.  So why am I throwing my two-cents worth into the cesspool of commentary on Judge Roy's two ton tablets?   urlLink Christopher Hitchens  made me do it.  At the above link, Hitchens doesn't bother arguing that the Commandments don't belong in a courthouse.  He argues that the commandments are bad religion, and religion in general is bad for morality.    A summary:  Only an insecure deity would chisel the first three commandments onto that slab of granite Moses lugged down from Mt. Sinai.  The sabbath law has no moral or ethical value.  "Honor thy father and mother" is sentimental, and unenforceable.  All societies ban murder and stealing, so these laws can't be the product of divine revelation.  And as for no coveting, it too is unenforceable, and totalitarian.  You can't legislate what people think.    Hitchens concludes by complaining about the arbitrariness of choosing these commandments rather than some of the more distasteful ones in scripture to post in a courthouse, and the unfairness of God in making us the way we are and then holding it against us.  Goodness.  Hitchens is a witty and deliberately provocative writer, but this contribution to Slate is not his best.    Arguing that there's nothing original about "Thou shalt not kill" ironically makes Judge Roy's case that the Ten Commandments are timeless truths acknowledged by all civilized societies and therefore belong in a court of law.    Hitchens puts his finger on the morality of the sabbath with a sarcastic comment about what organized labor in the land of Egypt might have wanted, but goes no further.  That's just it, Chris!  The sabbath is about social justice:  a forty hour work week, overtime pay, bankruptcy proceedings, even animal rights (your ass can't work on the sabbath either) can all be extrapolated from the fourth commandment.  But in fairness to Hitchens, if he can't see the ethical implications of the Ten Commandments, perhaps it's because Christians are content to adhere to the letter of the law, but not plumb the depths of its spirit.  Christians know all too well that these commandments are but ten of many, and some of the rest are distasteful to modern sensibilities.  Christians have rules for adjudicating between the diverse teachings of scripture, just as secular courts have long-established (but open to change) rules for interpreting constitutional, statutory and case law.  The Decalogue is a starting point, and the other stuff (fines for beating somebody's slave, etc.) is evaluated in light of how well it builds on the foundation, and how well it coheres with the person and work of Jesus, who is the end (the telos) of the law.    Secularists too have this burden.  Both Plessy V. Ferguson, which established the constitutionality of segregation, and Brown V. Board of Eduation, which overturned it (in the realm of education) were written after the 14th amendment was added to the Constitution.  Does that mean that the 14th amendment is worthless?  Hardly.  Christians have thought a lot about the riddle of an all-powerful, all-loving Creator and his recalcitrant creatures.  There's whole books on "original sin," "free will v. determinism," "the problem of evil," and "eschatology" (final things).  So Hitchens see some contradictions.  Is he aware of how Christians deal with these contradictions?  Does he care?  Is he willing to apply his own standards of consistency to secular movements?  If so, Hitchens will eventually have to smuggly dismiss the own ground he's taken his stand on, if Hitchens himself wants to be consistent.  It's easy to be provocative.  But thoughtfully provocative?  Christopher Hitchens has been in the past, but not today.

       Whodunnit ?  Let's return to the issue of just who it is that's killing American soldiers in Iraq.  Suppose the President is correct.  Suppose the killers are foreigners, Al Qaeda operatives, slipping into Iraq to take pot shots at the troops, and not ordinary Iraqis who are deleriously happy that we have invaded and occupied their country.  What does that prove?  Before the war, the administration was at pains to establish links between the regime of Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda.  The links were tenuous at best:  the Islamist Kurdish group Ansar al Islam, reputed to be in league with bin Laden, is a   Kurdish   group, sworn enemies of Saddam.    Thanks to the war, Al Qaeda is   more   active in Iraq than before the war.  Al Qaeda is killing   more   Americans now than they were between the overthrow of the Taliban and the overthrow of Saddam.  Nobody can say, "We weren't warned."   urlLink The Washington Post reminds us  that the President himself was warned by his own spies that, while cooperation between Saddam and bin Laden was highly unlikely, a war against Iraq might drive them into each others' arms.  When will we admit that this whole enterprise was a costly, terrible mistake?

      It's August.  Congress is in recess.  Your U.S. Representative is schlepping about the district.  Do you know what he thinks about the Drip, Drip, Drip of American blood on Iraqi soil?  The Honorable Howard Coble  urlLink told a bunch of Salisburians  that he still thinks the war was a great idea.  Yet he admitted that he's "not wild" about U.S. troops occupying Iraq for five to ten years.    Huh?  Four years after the Kosovo War we still have troops there.  Fifty years after the Korean War we still have troops there.  Fifty-eight years after the Second World War we still have troops in Germany.  Just what is Coble's ingenious, ground-breaking strategy for a quick exit from this latest American war zone?  Has Mr. Coble decided to hand over Iraq to that favorite international institution of all Congressional Republicans, the U.N.?  Not likely.  Rep. Coble is in a fix.  The policy he voted for last fall is blowing up in his face, literally.  He knows that his constituents are impatient and frustrated with the situation.  But he can't say "I was wrong."  The solution?  Echo the voters.  Say something that sounds impatient and frustrated, even if it doesn't make any logical sense.  Meanwhile American soldiers continue to lie in the bed that the Honorable Mr. Coble has made for them.  For some, it's a coffin.

      Did you know that there are Christians in Iraq?  There are even Presbyterian Christians in Iraq.   urlLink Here's what they're up to in the aftermath of the U.S. invasion .  It's worth remembering because debates over what role U.S. Evangelical groups ought to have in post-war Iraq assume that there aren't Christians there.  The question of whether or not Samaritan's Purse and other missionary operations should go in there with blankets and Bibles gets boiled down to "Should Christians evangelize Muslims?"    But Iraq has not been without a witness to Jesus Christ for all these centuries that it's been a majority Muslim country.  Instead of sending in the crusaders, why not ask the one million Iraqi Christians who are already there, who have done a remarkable job of transmitting the faith from one generation to the next in the face of outright persecution or benign neglect by the larger culture, "How can we help you?"    But such humility might not be easily mustered by folks who believe that they have all the answers.

      I'm getting to know more and more parents who don't want to force their children to go to church.  "Force" is the sticky word.  Shouldn't church be a joyful event?  Don't we want our children to want to be there?  And if we "force" them to attend against their will, won't they grow resentful of both their parents and organized religion?  Will they not rebel and worship at Saint Mattress every Sunday morning as soon as they're out on their own?  It's a plausible argument, but I'm not buying it.  It's so foreign to me.  In my family of origin church was taken for granted.  There was no question whatsoever that we would all be there every Sunday that we were in town and healthy.  There was no question that I would participate in our youth group, even though I had little in common with the other teenagers.  They were into hunting and sports.  I was into the debate team.  So I welcomed  urlLink Anne LaMott's comments  , reprinted in the latest  Christian Century .  Her son, whom we got to know as an infant in   urlLink Operating Instructions , is now a 14-year-old.  He hates church, but she makes him go.  She says that she makes him do a lot of things that he doesn't want to do, like homework and flossing his teeth.  Why?  Because it's good for him, and that's what good parenting is all about.    It's not that God doesn't love people who never darken the door of a sanctuary, but the greater point is to learn to love God back.  The best way to do that is to show up at Saint Mary's or Saint Timothy's on Sunday morning, rather than reclining at Saint Mattress, and imitate the beloved lovers in the pews.  Is it brainwashing to make participation in organized religion mandatory?  If you're worried about "indoctrinating" your son or daughter, rest assured that there are many folks out there whose consciences are not nearly as troubled as yours.  They will be happy to fill the vacuum that you've created in your child's life with their own visions of the good life:  conspicious consumption, substance abuse, brutality, sexual promiscuity.    It's not a question of whether or not our children will be indoctrinated.  The only question is whether or not parents will cede that responsibility to peers, the media, corporate America, the state and other principalities and powers.

      Tomorrow is an important day in the history of the Iraq War.  Donald Rumsfeld promised us a war that would last five days or five weeks, but five months?  "I doubt it," he said.  Tomorrow, August 20, the war turns five months old.  You say that the taking of Baghdad in the second week of April fell well within Rummy's timetable.  You say that war was over when President Bush landed on that aircraft carrier and declared "major combat" over.  You say that the war is over.  I guess it depends on your definition of war.  Once we get straight on that, maybe we can return to that debate on the meaning of the word "is."

       Social Security Silliness, Part Deux :  In the right corner we have local Libertarian Danny Brooks who  urlLink proposed a solution to Social Security's woes in Saturday's Charlotte Observer  (let's call it the Final Solution)--kill Social Security, let workers invest their FICA contributions in the stock market, and pay our obligations to current retirees by selling off federal assets.  Where do I begin?  At the end.  Imagine the feeding frenzy when corporate America shows up to bid at the great federal estate sale.  Wouldn't the Statue of Liberty look so much better hoisting a light bulb with the GE logo emblazoned upon it, instead of that no-name brand torch?  Remember the stink over Disney building a Civil War theme park next door to the Manassas battlefield?  Now imagine Mickey Mouse owning the battlefield itself.  How about Exxon-Mobil coming in with the low bid for Yellowstone National Park?  Or a commercial real estate outfit snapping up the Smokies?  Then Floridians wouldn't have to leave the park to tour the Ripley's Believe It or Not museum in Gatlinburg.  Nope; they'd just erect a Gatlinburg East right there in the middle of Cades Cove, and widen the park road to eight lanes.  But that's the low hanging fruit.  More serious is Brooks' moral challenge to Social Security.  He admits that if no one's forced to pay FICA, some may play the grasshopper and not lay up treasures for retirement.  They should rely on their families or churches, but not on the state, he argues.    That's the way it was before the Social Security Act was passed in 1935.  Families were more stable, and churches were fuller, yet senior citizens were more likely to be poor than any other demographic group.  Today the elderly are less likely to be poor than anyone else--the great triumph of Social Security.  The private sector can't bring to bear the muscle that the state can when tackling an issue like poverty.  But that's fine with Brooks.  If he can triple his return on what he's paying in payroll taxes, then what's a few more Alpo-eating old folks?  Brooks and his ilk have a definite moral vision for America.  It is a graceless, ruthlessly individualistic vision.  No second chances in Brooks' ideal world.  If you wind up eating dog food, all the Libertarians have for you is a bunch of "I told you sos."  Contrast that with the moral vision of Labor Secretary Frances Perkins, architect of Social Security.  A devoutly religious Episcopalian, Perkins made a silent retreat once a month for all twelve years that she served in FDR's cabinet.  She loved the concept of insurance because it married religion and science--the parable of the Good Samaritan written into actuarial tables.  With Social Security, risk is dispersed through the general population through the pooling of assets.  Everyone contributes, and the safety net is spread underneath everyone.  With Social Security we "bear one another's burdens and fulfill the law of Christ" (Galatians 6:2).  Social Security is not perfect, but with some tweaking it can be made reliable for years to come.  The "Individual Insecurity" that the Libertarians are selling is an unnecessarily radical and pagan solution.

       Social Security Silliness Part One :  In the left corner we have Vermont Governor Howard Dean, latest winner of  urlLink Slate's  "Whopper of the Week Award."  On the campaign trail Dean declared that he's never favored raising the retirement age for Social Security.  But  urlLink here is incontestable proof  that Dean told a big fat one.    What changed Dean's mind on raising the retirement age?  Has terrorism and the recession convinced Dean that Social Security is on a   sounder   footing now?  No.  He's running for the Democratic Presidential nomination, and to even admit that Social Security has a problem, much less suggest reducing benefits as a solution, is to thumb your nose at the received left-wing orthodoxy.    What's Social Security's problem?  It's a ponzi scheme, not an insurance plan.  Current workers are not laying up treasures for their retirement; they're financing the payouts to current retirees.  When the new money coming in can't keep up with the obligations to the people already in the system, Social Security, like all pyramid schemes, will collapse.  (I'll never forget the first time I had to file a 1040 return.  Ministers are self-employed for Social Security purposes, so my accountant had to figure my SECA tax as well as my income tax.  But I only had to write one check to the government.  "How will they know how much of this goes into the Social Security Trust Fund?"  I asked her.  "Silly boy," said the expression on my accountant's face.  She replied, "There's no such thing as a Social Security Trust Fund."  I sure was glad she cleared that up!)    It's not hard to fix Social Security.  Either increase revenue or cut payments.  The former option appeals to my sense of justice.  Only the first 80K of income is subject to FICA.  Think about that:  a corporate manager, an attorney and a software designer pay as much Social Security tax as Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and Oprah combined.  Lift that cap!  Your solvency problems will vanish.  But the latter option makes more sense given the purpose of the program.  When Social Security was established, the retirement age was roughly equal to the average life expectancy.  The program was never intended to fund endless rounds of golf followed by endless trips to some Myrtle Beach theater.  It's more modest goal is to keep you from having to eat dog food when you're too old and decrepit to work.  So why not raise the retirement age, given the fact that people are living so much longer?   Raise it on younger workers, not on 64 year olds.  I'm 33.  Why shouldn't I have to work until my early 70s to begin drawing benefits?  The 70 year olds I know today are like 55 year olds of previous years.  If God is willing, I'll still be relatively fit by then.  There'll be no reason for me to go on the dole before then.  But Democrats are loathe to cut any benefits, even when it makes such good sense.  They're fiddling while Rome burns, and I guess when Social Security is finally reduced to cinders, they'll blame it on the Republicans, as Nero blamed the Christians.

      Self-described "real American"  urlLink Geoff Metcalf  has come up with the best theory yet on why we haven't discovered weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  He says that the administration has the Iraqis dead to rights, but they're sandbagging.  Around the time of the Democratic primaries, the administration will release everything it knows about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, resulting in mass destruction of Democratic presidential aspirations.  Read about it  urlLink here .  This is a great theory, far better than "the dog ate my homework" theory espoused by so many right-wing pundits, namely, that the Iraqis destroyed their WMDs right before the outbreak of the war.    Only time will tell if Metcalf is right.  But if he is, then  urlLink E.J. Dionne is right to argue  that Democrats ought not write off John Edwards and Dick Gephardt too soon.  Both voted in favor of the war on Iraq. Both have been campaigning on bread and butter issues, health care for instance, instead of bashing the President on his decision to invade Iraq.

      One day we will "find" weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  When that day comes, pardon me if I'm as skeptical as I was when Hillary Clinton "found" those Rose Law Firm billing records in her closet.

      Buried in Sunday's newspaper I found an  urlLink article  that rebutts, point by point, the allegations that Secretary of State Colin Powell made against Iraq at that U.N. Security Council meeting last February 5.  Some highlights:  Remember the trailors, the mobile weapon factories?  Defense Intelligence Agency officials admitted this week that the Iraqis used the trailors to make hydrogen for weather balloons.  How about those chemical weapon warheads that Powell said were "the tip of the iceberg?"  On June 16, Hans Blix, chief U.N. weapons inspector, reported that the warheads (which were empty) had never been unboxed.  "Debris from the past," he said.  How about all that anthrax that Powell said the Iraqis were supposedly packing?  U.S. occupation forces have found none, and a U.N. report dated May 30 verified Iraqi claims that they'd destroyed their anthrax.  I could go on and on, but why not  urlLink read it for yourself ?  Then ask yourself (and the administration) some questions:     Question :  Since we conquered Iraq, have we discovered anything to substantiate the allegation that Iraq was a clear and present danger to the U.S. at the time the war broke out?    Answer :  No.   Question :  Is the United States more secure today than before the war?  (Remember, Americans continue to be killed on a daily basis in Iraq.  And take note that right now there are only three combat brigades in the U.S. Army that are either not deployed or not scheduled for deployment.   And both Iran and North Korea could "go nuclear" in the near future.)    Answer :  No.  Is it revisionist history to ask such questions?  Of course not.  It's the Bush administration that's revising history by asking us to ignore the facts on the ground in Iraq.  Is it the media's "liberal bias" that would lead to such an unflattering article about Powell's speech?  Only if plain, ordinary fact-checking is liberal bias rather than good journalistic practice.  If the facts don't leave the White House smelling like a rose, is it "fair and balanced" to suppress those facts?  If it's "liberal bias" that fueled the AP article, why wasn't it on the front page?  Should we ignore the fact that the administration's case for war didn't pan out simply because Saddam Hussein is a real bad guy, and happily he's no longer in power?  There are real bad guys running Burma too.  Heck, they put Nobel Laureates under house arrest in Burma.  They torture and kill dissidents there too.  Are you ready to roll in there with the last three combat brigades the Army can spare?  Isn't it true that the war was really about the President's need for avenging the plot that Saddam Hussein hatched against his father?  Wasn't the war really about "sending a message" to the world, especially the Arab world, after 9/11?  Don't you think that you need to send a message to the cowboys in the White House next November?  The message might be:  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  (Remember, leave no chads hanging when you deliver your message.)

      I created this weblog thanks to the free technology available at  urlLink Blogger .  But there's a price to be paid:  banner ads.  Lately I've noticed that the banner ads seem to parallel the conversation topics in my blog.  Last weekend I referred to "Reformed Theology" in an entry about the sabbath, and presto!  At the top of the page was an ad for "Reformed Theological Seminary."  Any blog addressing the war in Iraq and the search for weapons of mass destruction is crowned with an ad for the new book "Weapons of Mass Deception."  So in my next post we're going to try a little test...

      The kind of peace activist I don't want to be:  God-blogger  urlLink Telford Work  has called our attention to the  urlLink dispiriting story  of a peace group called Voices in the Wilderness.  The organization's goal was the lifting of  U.N. sanctions on Iraq.  Voices is a mostly Catholic group strongly influenced by the aggressive nonviolence of the Berrigan brothers.  These guys literally "beat swords into plowshares" by trespassing onto military bases and whacking fighter jets with hammers.  Voices members continued in that tradition with creative street protests, and traveling to Iraq with medical supplies in hand, in defiance of heavy federal penalties for visiting the pariah state.    According to the above link, the activists in Voices became mouthpieces for the regime of Saddam Hussein.  They never criticized the regime for its horrible human rights record.  There was only one problem in Iraq in the 1990s, they said, U.N. sanctions and U.S. foreign policy.  In the 1920s Lenin called Red-friendly folk in Europe "useful idiots."  I wouldn't go that far with Voices in the Wilderness.  I met the director, a woman named Kathy Kelly, at the 1998  urlLink Pax Christi  national conference.  She was in the middle of a twenty-one day fast for the lifting of the sanctions.  That's impressive.  The sanctions were harsh and did contribute to the deaths of Iraqi civilians, although the U.N. Oil for Food program did improve matters a bit.    But one can never evaluate any political conflict in black and white terms.  Beware of reductionisms on the left where everything that's wrong with the world is the fault of U.S. imperialism.  AND beware of all right wing reductionisms that would draw the line between good and evil where the Coalition of the Willing meets everyone else.  Activists of all stripes would profit from reading a little Karl Barth:       We reject the false doctrine, as though the church were permitted to abandon the form of its message and order to its own pleasure or to changes in prevailing ideological and political convictions.        We reject the false doctrine, as though the church in human arrogance could place the Word and work of the Lord in the service of any arbitrarily chosen desires, purposes or plans.   New Testament scholar  urlLink Ched Myers  has proposed that the pupose of the gospel of Mark was to create a Christian community of "radical nonalignment" during the time of the Jewish uprising of 70 AD.  Rejecting violence in the name of the cross of Jesus, Christians were suspect among both Jewish revolutionaries and the Roman authorities.  According to Myers, Jesus' statement "You will be hated by all on account of my name," is directed to the Christian situation in the generation after his death, as they were caught between the rock of imperialism and the hard place of violent revolution.  It's probably unfair to invoke Myers' name in criticizing Voices in the Wilderness, since both Myers and Voices founder Kathy Kelly were at that 1998 Pax Christi conference, and Myers had many complimentary things to say about Voices.  But "radical nonalignment" is where the church needs to be.  One need not become an apologist for dictators just because one is working against unjust dimensions of U.S. foreign policy, as was the case with Voices in the Wilderness.  At the same time, Christians must find ways to support our fellow human beings oppressed by dictatorial regimes without endorsing their violent overthrow at the hands of the U.S. military.

      Why don't the Episcopalians make the  urlLink front page  when they send missionaries somewhere?  Why aren't the Episcopalians the headline story when they feed the hungry?  Why isn't the media crowding around altar rails in Episcopal parishes everywhere straining to get a better look at this bread that's transformed into the body of a Palestinian Jew executed 2,000 years ago?    Worthless.  They wouldn't know a good story if it bit them on the rear end.

But that's what makes a fundamentalist a fundamentalist.  They couldn't care less about your ethics if you don't buy their theology. And it works both ways.  Mullah Omar has no use whatsoever for Rev. Flip.  If ever there were two people who deserved each other...

       Happy birthday Ethan !  Our oldest son turns six today.  I remember August 5, 1997 quite well.  Laura already had an appointment scheduled at her OB-GYN practice, and she had a pretty good feeling that she wouldn't be going home afterward.  Laura walked into the examining room, announced to her physician that the baby was coming, and we both got that patronizing, "How sweet, but let's not get too excited" look from her.  Then she examined Laura and promptly shipped us over to  urlLink St. Mary's Hospital .  Things didn't get too stressful until General Hospital came on.  So I, good coach that I was, tried to get Laura to begin her breathing exercises.  "That's not going to cut it!"  she snarled.  The nurse came in, and I complained, "She's not doing her breathing exercises."  The nurse asked, "Well, is she breathing?"  She was.  "Then what are you worried about?" she asked.    So I sat there feeling like failure.  Then I watched Laura's breathing, and realized that she was doing exactly what the childbirth class instructer taught us to do, but for active labor, not the preliminary breathing exercises.  "Now I get it!" I thought.  "We're a lot farther along that I knew."  So then I was able to coach her on her breathing the right way.  (All that coaching stuff is for the father, not the mother, so that we won't feel utterly useless, I've decided.  Oh, I did feed her some chipped ice.  I think that actually helped a little bit.)  And then at 6:30 or so, out came Ethan!  The most amazing thing in the world, seeing your own child born.  He was red all over (now he's just red on top!), and screaming bloody murder.  On the one hand, a newborn baby is a pretty big thing to come out of someone else's body.  On the other hand, I look at Ethan today, and can't imagine that he once fit on our changing table.  Six years makes so little difference to us, so much difference to them.    It's been a great six years.  And Thursday he starts kindergarden.  In six more years he'll be on the cusp of his teenage years.  Unbelievable.

      Whither the peace movement?  Despite a turnout of millions in the streets of Rome, London and New York, despite an avalanche of faxes on Capital Hil, despite innumerable candlelight vigils and prayers for peace, the war happened anyway.  What now?  "The antiwar movement is in despair," said Janet Chisholm, a field worker for the  urlLink Fellowship of Reconciliation , at the Presbyterian Peacemaking Conference.  That sounded strange to me.  Many anti-war folks I know have adopted a grimly satisfied "See I told you so" pose as U.S. forces continue to suffer casualties months after the President declared major combat over.  Then a friend linked me to  urlLink this article .  Face it, says the pseudonymous "Gaius Publius."  The administration didn't fool the American people with tall tales of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  The American people are a violent and racist lot.  They're all too happy to let Dubya unleash our soldiers on brown-skinned infidels everywhere, and more than willing to turn a blind eye to torture and brutality, either at Guantanamo Bay or in Pakistani prisons.  Whatever it takes to keep us fat and happy.  "Woe is me!  I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips!"  Except that Gaius Publius doesn't bother confessing his own sins, just those of his thuggish countrymen.  This is despair, and self-righteousness.  It's the left's turn to wallow in it.  Five years ago, to the astonishment of everybody in AM radio land, the American people rewarded President Clinton for his affair with Monica Lewinsky by turning out the Republicans in the mid-term elections.  Conservatives moped about an immoral electorate while liberals praised the American people's sense of fair play.  Today the tables have turned.  So how did the American people go from being so decent in 1998 to being so despicable today?  Maybe the far left and the far right are both correct.  Maybe Americans are both libertines and violent racists.  Or maybe despair and self-righteouness are entirely predictable stages that every social movement goes through.  This is what FOR staffer Chisolm says, pointing to the work of Bill Moyer (not the TV guy), who has studied social change movements.    It goes like this:  There's a problem.  Groups organize to tackle the problem, researching alternatives, pressuring elected leaders, educating the public.  The movement takes off.  Then there's resistance.  Goals go unachieved.  People lose interest.   At this point, movements can choose to stay small and pure and rage at the machine, or work to broaden their base of support.  Gaius Publius's rant about TV watching Americans heaping Judge Judy-style justice on the Muslim world is an example of the former.    But that option's not limited to liberals.  There's no better example of desperate self-righteousness than Rev. Flip Benham, of the pro-life group  urlLink Operation Save America .  Rev. Flip rolled into Charlotte last month with a car plastered with photos of aborted fetuses.  His groupies picketed mosques, liberal churches that have welcomed homosexuals and even conservative churches that aren't, in Rev. Flip's opinion, pulling their weight.    It's understandable.  Both pro-lifers and peaceniks are on a long losing streak.  Insulting or grossing out a public that's turned a blind eye to your concerns may make one feel better, but what do you want?  To feel better or get something done?  If you opt for the latter, then, says Moyer, activists have to involve mainstream citizens and institutions in solving the problem.  Then the movement takes off again as its values are "injected" into the larger body politic.  Finally, success!  But if and only if change/success is really the goal, and not self-righteousness.  If and only if you're willing to sit down with people who watch Judge Judy, listen to their concerns, and try to involve them, to any extent possible, in crafting a solution.  If you were against the war, what now?  If you need a howling at the moon fix, there's always  urlLink Doonesbury .  Grim satisfaction about a chaotic Iraq is not an option, since that requires people dying, and if you're a peace activist, you ought to be against that.    Now then, roll up your sleeves and get to work.  Read up on international affairs.  Read up on the history of nonviolent social change.  Read the Bible.  Pray.

      It was agreed--after church Laura and I would finish pulling weeds in the back yard, get showers, eat, put the kids down and watch a movie.  But as we were standing in the kitchen grating cheese and peeling cucumbers an anachronistic question entered my mind:  Is it a good idea to rent a movie tonight?  It's Sunday, the Christian sabbath.  Does anybody wonder how to properly observe the sabbath day anymore?  In the "good ol' days" nobody had to wonder.  The state saw to it that you didn't engage in any prohibited behavior.  Today nobody wonders because Sunday is just another day, a day for soccer matches in the morning, followed by a trip to the mall or the golf course in the afternoon.  In the autumn, it's the NFL.  And yet "Keep the sabbath holy" remains one of the ten commandments, whether the state enforces it or not.  Reformed Christians believe that while obeying the law doesn't save us, it's an excellent guide for how to express gratitude to God for saving us.  If Sunday is just another day, are we not ingrates?  When I was a kid, Sunday was a day for church and family.  We'd go to Sunday School and morning worship, come home for lunch (I remember pork chops being served with some frequency on Sundays), and entertain relatives.  Uncle Rupert and Aunt Gert would pick up Aunt Mae and come calling, but always leave in time for Uncle Rupert to get home to watch 60 Minutes.  We didn't do yard work on Sundays.  For Dad, "You shalt not do any work" ruled out picking up a rake or grasping a lawn mower string.  That's not a bad way to spend a day.  God, family, and rest from physial labor.    Today, my Sundays are a bit different.  To begin with, Sunday is a work day for me--the hardest of the week, deaths and funerals notwithstanding.  I get paid to lead worship.  So how does someone like me keep a holy sabbath?  In Exodus, the rationale for the sabbath is theological--to glorify the God who created the world in six days and rested on the seventh.  In Deuteronomy the sabbath rationale is humanitarian--everyone needs rest from labor, even your slave, even your donkey.    So my solution is to spread different aspects of sabbath observance around the weekend.  Sunday is for worship, for glorifying God.  At times I am able to quit worrying about my sermon enough to actually sing a hymn for God.  Friday is my day off.  I do my best to stay away from the office every Friday.  If something comes up, a death for instance, I'm not legalistic.  I do the work, and try to take some time for myself elsewhere.  I don't feel guilty about pulling weeds on Sunday.  It's manual labor, but not work in the sense of it being my livelihood.  My Dad grew up on a farm, and I imagine that he and everybody in his family and community so looked forward to a day of not walking behind a mule that he would never give that up, not even to walk behind a mower in his later years.    And what about that DVD rental?  We borrowed a couple from our neighbor.  If I want people to come to church, then why shuold I make it profitable for businesses to be open on Sunday?  If nobody shopped on Sunday, then nobody would be kept from worship by having to work.  They still might not come, but at least it wouldn't be my fault.  A post script:  my treatment of the fourth commandment has been much too individualistic.  Remember the sabbath's humanitarian rationale.  Every Israelite got a day off of work because in Egypt nobody got a day off, and God isn't going to engineer an exodus only for the chosen people to go to Canaan and re-create Egypt there.  No.  Israel is called to do justice and righteousness.  No slavery.  No oppression.  No overworked, underpaid, taken-for-granted work force.  Perhaps re-discovering the meaning of the sabbath for modern times has less to do with bringing back the blue laws, and more to do with paying people a living wage, so that they don't have to work three jobs to put food on the table.  Perhaps it means re-examining our trade policies which have exported American goods, and jobs overseas.

       urlLink We've already compared the lies of the current administration with the former administration .  Now let's compare criminal investigations.  When Ken Starr opened his investigation into whether or not President Clinton lied about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, what was at stake?  Was he investigating a crime that put anyone's life at risk?  Was he investigating a crime that might have compromised national security?  Now ask yourself the same questions about the allegations that senior White House officials outed a CIA agent in order to punish her husband for publically criticizing the administration's case for againt Iraq.

      Is an "amicable divorce" in the future for the Presbyterian Church?  One conservative Presbyterian hopes so.  Robert Howard, a past President of the  urlLink Presbyerian Lay Committee , claims that liberals and conservatives have irreconcilable differences over Christology, the authority of scripture, and human sexuality.  Howard has proposed a process he calls "Gracious Separation" which would lead to the dissolution of the present denomination--liberals and conservatives going their own ways.  Congregations would vote on which new denomination to join.  The current denomination's assets would be divided based on the intent of the donor, or lacking clear intent, a percentage based on the respective numbers of the new denominations.  The Lay Committee has declined to endorse Howard's proposal, though they gave it a lot of coverage in the new  Presbyterian Layman .  Its doubtful that "Gracious Separation" has a chance without the overt backing of the leading conservative groups, the Lay Committee or Presbyterians for Renewal.  One could easily question the timing of the proposal.  The Presbyerian Church, unlike the Episcopal Church, has amended its constitution to bar the ordination of non-celibate homosexuals.  Several attempts to repeal the ban have failed.  The presbyteries are enforcing the conservative policy, if with great reluctance.  Just a couple of months ago Cincinnati Presbytery defrocked a pastor who performed same-sex marriage ceremonies after repeated warnings to cease and desist.  Isn't Howard snatching defeat from the jaws of victory by suing for divorce now?    Or does Howard look at the Episcopalians and the Supreme Court's ruling against the Texas sodomy law, and see the handwriting on the wall?  In that case, perhaps Howard thinks it's prudent for conservatives to get out while the getting's good.  The news that we are at irreconcilable differences was indeed news to me.  When I look out at my congregation on Sunday morning I see people who would be happy with a gay or lesbian elder on the session, and people who would be appalled by such a development.  They seem to worship and work well together at present.    A couple of years ago, as our presbytery prepared to debate homosexuailty yet again, I led our session in an exercise.  Those who supported the ban had to stand one corner; those who were opposed to the ban had to stand in the other corner, and the undecided ones had to stand in between.  I had planned to have each side argue the other side's point of view, but that ingenious plan went up in smoke when nearly everybody congregated in the middle.  So it is with most of the denomination, I suspect.  Most people are uncomfortable with homosexuailty to some extent, but are also uncomfortable with being judgmental.  The far left and the far right are at loggerheads, but most Presbyterians muddle along down the center of the highway, reeling in the left when it overreaches, and rebuking the right when they get hysterical.    That's why there'd be nothing gracious about a separation in the Presbyterian Church.  Most Presbyterians, being in the middle, would deeply resent being forced to choose one way or the other.  I know I would.    Where would I belong, with the hypocritics on the right who insist on a literal interpretation of the Bible when it comes to sex, but not to economics or war?  Or how about with the loosy-goosy leftists who throw out the baby with the bathwater with their high regard for sodomy and low regard for the doctrine of the Trinity?    Sigh.  A plague on both their houses.  I'll muddle along in the middle.

      I couldn't have asked for a better birthday.  Mom sent me a new shirt and matching sweater vest.  I hate shopping for clothes, and if it weren't for birthdays and moms I'd probably have to go naked.  My kids made me coffee mugs.  They're now sitting in a place of prominence amid the clutter of my desk.  The Wolfpack outscored the Tarheels, and I closed out the evening with a play at Catawba College--a world premier, no less!  Rather trite, but the actors threw themselves into their parts.  It was an enjoyable, if less than intellectually stimulating, experience.  The best present arrived a few weeks early.  Not too long ago, I got carded!  Not bad for someone born on September 27, 1969.  I made it through my thirty-third year without getting crucified.  The next big challenge:  avoiding martyrdom long enough to see Middle Age.  (MLK and Bonhoeffer both died at age 39).  But if I have to lose my life in order to save it, then how well am I really doing?

      I love reading Cal Thomas because I usually disagree with every single word he writes.   urlLink This column  is no exception.  Thomas rates President Bush's trip to the U.N. a great success because he gave what-fer to the "weenies" (Thomas' terminology) who opposed the Iraq War.  Neither Thomas nor Bush's speech writers know the old adage, "You can attract more flies with honey than vinegar."  No matter.  I prefer to evaluate deeds rather than words, and by that standard Bush's trip to New York was a failure.  Bush failed to bully ("persuade" is not something that this administration, intellectually and tempermentally, is up to) world leaders to put up money or troops to stabilize Iraq.    The speech was "a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."  Nothing except that the status quo remains intact:  Americans will pay the entire cost, both in dollars and in human lives in Iraq.

      While driving to work I listened to a tape of Ah-nold and Ariana mixing it up at last night's California gubernatorial debate.  William Saffire was right; interpreters would have helped!  The NPR reporter stated that after the audience whooped its approval of the smack-talking exchange, the debate moderator reminded them that they weren't watching Comedy Central.  Well, forgive us for being confused!  Ah-nold wants to be chief executive of the world's sixth largest economy, and where does he announce his run?  On the steps of the state capital?  At a press conference?  Across a table from Charlie Rose?  No.  On the Tonight Show with Jay Leno.  Leno, fair and balanced newshound that he is, just last week had over 90 of the 135 candidates for governor also appear on the show.  Those vying for governor include Gary Coleman and that crippled porno kingpin.  Flint, yeah, that's his name.  Republicans are right:  this is not a coup.  It's all very legal.  It's also ridiculous, embarassing, silly and pathetic.  I predict that Gray Davis will survive, not because anybody likes him, but because Californians are tired of being a laughingstock.

      What can Democrats running for President learn from yesterday's Republican City Council primary in Charlotte?  Races are won or lost on the future, not the past.  Mayor Pat McCrory and Councilwoman Lynn Wheeler faced primary challenges because they pushed through a new, publically financed basketball arena after voters regected the concept in a non-binding referendum a couple of years ago.  Grumpy, anti-tax, anti-everything Charlotte Republicans bet that resentment over the arena would propel them to the top of the ticket in the fall elections.    It wasn't to be.  McCrory cruised, winning better than 60% of the vote.  Wheeler lost, but as today's  urlLink Charlotte Observer notes , she spent little of her hundred grand war chest in the primary.  Wheeler's own laziness seems to have cost her another tern, not any anti-arena backlash.  In short, the arena's a done deal.  Voters accepted this, and that meant that the far right candidates got nowhere yesterday.  This cools me a little on Howard Dean's prospects against President Bush.  Dean delights in bashing the administration on bungling the occupation.  He loves to point out the lies that the administration told to justify the war.  Yet the war happened.  I imagine that voters in November of 2004 will not be voting for or against a war that's already been waged, but for the candidate who has the best plan to manage the occupation come January, 2005.  There is "a time to break down and a time to build up" (Ecclesiastes 3: 3).  The time is coming for Dean and other Democrats to tell us their plan for building up Iraq.

       Online music swapping has been killing the recording industry.   A couple of years ago they successfully sued Napster, the internet file-sharing company, for facilitating copyright infringment.  That didn't stop the free distribution of music over the internet.  Like blowing the head off a dandelion, new software and new techniques sprouted to replace Napster.   So now they're suing the little guys.  Literally.  This week, a bunch of 12 to 15 year olds got  urlLink served papers  for illegally distributing copyrighted music.    Bullies.  It's not enough that Big Media wants to choose your musical taste for you--Just try finding any truly interesting music on your radio dial.  The classic rock stations haven't changed their playlists in 15 years.  The pop stations stick strictly to bubblegum or hip-hop, most of which is is rapping over samples ripped from the classic rock playlist).    Big Media also wants you to pay through the nose for their unoriginal music.  A CD costs $1 to make, but retails for $18.  If record companies are in a huff over file sharing, it's their own fault.  Ask any economist:  when you set the price too high, you create a black market for your good or service.  I don't do file sharing because this blog is about all that I want to learn how to do on the internet.  Plus, I'm operating a Pentium 133, a hand-me-down from my brother-in-law's wife.  No place to store those MP3 files.  Nor do I buy CDs.  Can't afford them, and even if I could, I won't be extorted.  I listen to the music I like  urlLink here , and  urlLink here .  No triple-sets of Skynard, and no Britney.  Problem is, I'm still doing dial up, so I can't listen and receive phone calls.  I'll soon invest in a cable or DSL line--not more CDs--and tap a variety of sounds out there, all for free, and much better quailty than what Big Media's promoting on Clear Channel.

      I caught a bit of the hurricane pregame show last night (Isabel, not the University of Miami).   urlLink Channel Three's Paul Cameron  was jabbering with some reporter in Morehead City (a little wimpy reporter, if you ask me; real men and women go to Okracoke Island to face Isabel).    What were they talking about?  Isabel?  No.  Hurricane Andrew, the most devestating hurricane in American history in terms of dollars worth of damage.  Cameron reminisced that he couldn't even recognize his parents' south Florida neighborhood after Andrew's wrath.  The little wimpy reporter shared that friends of his down there had to carry guns for weeks after Andrew because of the chaos the storm unleashed on the sunshine state.  Yet another example of sheer speculation at best, and fear-mongering at worst, which is always what the news media resorts to when they have to be on the air but have few hard facts to report.  When it comes to Isabel, the local TV news stations remind me of Democrats following the news from Iraq:  both are hoping for a disaster.  Let's hope Isabel disappoints.  (And let's hope Iraq disappoints.  Who wants to re-capture the White House with the blood of American servicemen and innocent Iraqis?)

       It's been hard preaching a sermon series on the Apostles' Creed.   I prefer to follow the lectionary.  It hands me a passage of scripture.  I poke around inside it for what is surprising, disturbing, elating, etc.  If my insights call to mind a theological doctrine, then I let that doctrine be the framework for my exploration of the text.  With a series on the Creed, I'm having to work backwards. I have to ask, "What is this line in the Creed affirming?" and look for a scripture that proves it or illustrates it.  But most surprising to me is that I sound a lot more conservative when I'm preaching on the Creed.  Thus far I've stressed the saving power of faith in Christ, the uniqueness of Jesus, his sacrifice on the cross which satisfies the wrath of God, and the doctrine of the Virgin Birth.  This Sunday I will defend the reliability of his bodily resurrection.  When "He shall come again to judge the quick and the dead" coincides with World Communion Sunday, I will stress the need for self-examination before eating the Holy Supper.  Still to come:  sermons on the second coming and on the necessity of the church in our age of privatized religion.  (While I sound a lot more conservative to myself, I don't know what I sound like to the congregation.  With a few exceptions, I continue to get the same non-commital "Good sermon" comments on the way out the door that I did before I began the series.)  When one follows the lectionary, it's easy to fall into a ravine of liberal do-goodism, especially if you preach constantly on the gospels.  Matthew, Mark and Luke serve up a healing, followed by an exorcism, followed by a sermon, and more of the same.  When one dines exclusively on the gospels, it's so easy to regurgitate a vision of the faith that is, ironically, little more than works-righteousness.  The questions, "Where did we come from?  Where are we going?  What's so special about Jesus, anyway?"  never get asked, let alone answered.  An analogy--tourists are typically one of two types:  There are those who never go anywhere unless they're booked on a tour with a guide and a pre-set itinerary.  Then there are those who don't schedule anything, and prefer to snoop around on their own.    You can see the benefits to each approach.  After you've seen the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building and  Cats , why not take in an off-Broadway play, or discover a lesser known New York City landmark on your own?  On the other hand, can anyone imagine visiting New York and never taking in the Statue of Liberty?  My theology professor encouraged us to think of the creeds as signposts that point out significant concepts in scripture.  After wandering the streets of the Old and New Testament myself for quite a while, I've seen a lot that I never saw before, certainly not in Sunday School.  But my series on the Creed has called my attention back to the old monuments.  Just like you never get tired of looking at the Statue of Liberty, it's always refreshing to hear about the forgiveness of sins and life everlasting.

       urlLink Paul Krugman , Princeton economist and  urlLink New York Times columnist , has made plenty of people mad by calling the President a liar.  How thin-skinned can you get?  The folks who can't believe that anyone would accuse our Commander in Chief of being veraciously-challenged are the same people who happily passed along unsubstantiated, fanciful rumors that President Clinton was a rapist and his wife a murderer.  But I digress.  What whoppers has the President told?  you're wondering.  Krugman writes that just about everything this administration says about its economic policies is deceitful.  To know what the Bushites are up to, one has to listen to their ideological mentors in right-wing think tanks like the Heritage Foundation.    The conservative policy wonks hate the modern welfare state.  They resent Social Security, loathe Medicare, and fume about Medicaid.  But they know that these programs are enormously popular.  So they propose that Republicans kill these programs by starving them of the revenue that they need to operate.  Sooner or later declining federal tax receipts brought about by steep tax cuts will collide head-on with enormous bills owed to retirees.  Conservatives are betting that the financial crisis of the future won't result in rioting or in the devaluation of the U.S. dollar, but in a roll back and eventual repeal of the flagship programs of the New Deal.  They say that all quite openly.    President Bush's tax policy is a giant leap forward in this game of economic and fiscal brinksmanship.  But the President does not talk the game that the staffers at Heritage who wrote his tax cut bills talk.  He ran on "saving" Social Security, not demolishing it.  His underlings call his plan "tax relief for working families," even though 45% of the tax cut goes to the top 1% of income earners.  They call it a "jobs and growth" plan when it has nothing to do with jobs or growth, and has everything to do with making the tax code as regressive as possible.  They say that the deficits are a temporary phenomenon, when in fact there is no plan to reduce deficits.  Red ink is part of a strategic plan to drown Medicare and Social Security.  The L word is not too strong to use when evaluating the Bush administration's economic plans.  Krugman is receiving a prophet's reward for calling the White House on it when their rhetoric doesn't square with their policies.  You may be a cynic.  You may think, "They're all liars.  All politicians lie."  I'm right there with you, Brother.  But let's compare lies.  Bill Clinton lied about the nature of a consentual relationship with a woman, in a deposition in a civil lawsuit that was eventually thrown out of court because it was so obviously bogus and politically motivated.  For that lie he was impeached, he was found in contempt of court and fined, and he surrended his license to practice law.  George W. Bush lies about substantive matters.  His lies get people killed (Iraq.)  His lies will return U.S. society to where it was in the Hoover administration, without the informed consent of the governed.  And the press still goes on about how in this post-9/11 age we need someone with the moral clarity of Bush to lead us in this crusade against evil.  Give me a break.

       What are the spiders up to?   When I walked out this morning to get the paper there were spider webs everywhere.  Little pouches nestled in the grass, like whispy pita bread.  On the shrubs the spiders had spun balconies, flat webs extending out from branch to branch.  And there were the stereotypical big round ones.  I found a huge web in the church parking lot, anchored between the sidewalk and a maple branch at least six feet in the air.  By lunch the ones on the ground had disappeared, but I could still see webs in the bushes and trees.  There was fog this morning.  Perhaps the webs are always there, but the heavy dew and high humidity made them more visible.  Or maybe the spiders know that the hurricane is coming, and they are spreading their traps far and wide to collect any and all hapless bugs blown 250 miles inland.  My wife suggested that they're getting ready for winter.  Spinning, hunting, eating, adding fat, and the like.  I'm also wondering if the spiders, like Salisbury's Upper Crust who will soon open their mansions for the fall Home Tour, aren't simply showing off their commodious dwellings.  In  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , Harry and Ron, acting on the dubious advice of the terminated groundskeeper, Hagrid, follow a trail of spiders into the Forbidden Forest in order to solve the mystery of what's turning Hogwarts students into stone.  It's not pleasant what they find.  And if you've seen  The Two Towers  but haven't read The  Lord of the Rings  trilogy, you're wondering who the  SHE  is of whom Gollum speaks at the end of the movie.  You'll see her long, lean legs in  The Return of the King , all eight of them, but there'll be nothing arousing about it.  Arachnids don't frighten me.  I don't have a problem with snakes.  It's vermin like rats that give me the creeps.  But just to be on the safe side, I think I won't investigate any further the proliferation of spider webs in my own community.  Ignorance is bliss.

       What a concidence!   Hurricane Isabel is baring its teeth in the Atlantic, and I'm perusing a new book on "natural theology" (what we an learn about the Creator from observing the creation.)  It's called  The   Savage Side:  Reclaiming Violent Models of God , by B. Jill Carroll, a professor of religious studies at Rice.  Polemical doesn't begin to describe what I'm reading.  Carroll notes that most modern "political theologies" (theologies whose central thrust is the liberation of oppressed peoples) lean toward an immanent view of God.  The world is God's home, says Sallie McFague, feminist and environmental theologian.  Feminist and liberation theologians distrust transcendent models of God because a God who is hierarchically related to the world justifies hierarchical relationships between humans.  McFague's God is not the same as nature, but dwells in it--a peaceful deity calling human beings into new, non-exploitative relationships with the world.  Carroll uses the nature writings of Annie Dillard ( Pilgram at Tinker Creek ,  Holy The Firm , etc.) and the categories of Jewish philosopher Emmanuel Levinas to expose how naive McFague is.  Carroll argues that much of our experience of nature is harsh and amoral, viruses chewing away at us, hurricanes taking aim at us relentlessly, animals eating their young, etc.  (You wouldn't believe how hateful bugs can be!)  Any attempt to enlist the God we meet in nature in our petty political causes only works if one turns a blind eye to the hard facts of our creaturely existence.  Carroll sites one passage in  Pilgram  in which Dillard says that if the the force behind the evolutionary process were a CEO of Southern Railroad, this is how he would run his business:    Say the railroad needed three new locomotives.  Instead of building three train engines, this CEO would build a thousand, highly complicated engines, and then release them on the same stretch of track without any operators.  They crash, burn, derail.  Only three are left, and the demand is supplied.    If this God's "eye is on the sparrow," it may be for no other reason than to watch it get devoured by a hawk.  So why might the east coast of the U.S. be devestated by a category 5 hurricane?  A secularist would say, "It was in the way of random, atmospheric events."  A Calvinist might say, "Although God's ways are hidden to us, we can trust that God did not allow this for any reason except that which will eventually bring a blessing on us."  Dillard and Carroll might say, "Because God likes slamming things together as much as kids like kicking over ant hills."  Well, I can't tell you how much this makes me want to run out and praise the Lord tomorrow morning!  Though I find it disturbing, I am enjoying reading Carroll's book.  Hers' is an unsentimental God whose not at the beck and call of anyone, even his human subjects.  If there's anything I can't stand, it's sentimentality, especially on the political left (you're always hardest on your closest friends and family).  I'll keep you updated as I finish it, maybe by candlelight if Isabel is a repeat of Hugo.

       How cool was Johnny Cash ?  This cool:  The other day I went looking for a new acquaintance, a professor in the Catawba College Theater Arts department.  He was in his office, deep in the bowels of the campus theater.  He gave me a tour of the place.  We observed dressing rooms, rows of costumes, and spotlights stored beneath a stairwell.  In one room a couple of students, theater types, were working.  And what was playing softly on the portable CD player?  Johnny Cash.  Not bad for a man who recorded his first hit in the 50s.  Fifty years from now, if Britney and Madonna are still kissing, will college kids even notice?

      I serve on our presbytery's Committee on Preparation for Ministry.  At our Wednesday meeting I had an exchange with a future minister that illustrates as well as anything what it means to be Presbyterian.    She was applying to become a Candidate, the second step along the road to ordination.  Her statement of faith contained staples of Reformed Theology such as--God loves us in spite of our unworthiness.  Knowing that this person was raised in a rather rigid Southern Baptist home, I said, "Baptists can talk about sin and grace too.  What about your understanding of sin and grace do you owe to your Baptist heritage, and what do you owe to your Presbyterian heritage?"  She replied, "It has everything to do with who makes the first move.  When I was a kid, it was beaten into my head, 'If you want a relationship with God, then you've got to take the first step.'  But I remember a severely and profoundly mentally disabled girl in a church service.  Everyone was saying the 'Sinner's Prayer,' except for her.  All she could make were bird sounds.  It dawned on me that, in God's eyes, I was she, and she was me, and if we have to make the first move with God, then nobody can be saved."  God makes the first move.  Or, in the words of Frederick Whitfield's camp meeting hymn, "O, how I love Jesus, because he first loved me."  Behind the severe Reformed doctrines of Original Sin, Total Depravity and Predestination is this Glad Tidings--God makes the first move.  That's what it means to be Presbyterian.

       Today on The Ivy Bush:  Bach at a Trot .   urlLink In this article for Slate , Jan Swafford pans the early music movement.  For the uninitiated, the early music movement tries to perform the music of 18th century composers as it might have been performed 250 years ago.  In general, this means thinner string sections, smaller choirs (quartets, even), and faster tempos.  Let Bach and Handel sound as crisp and lean as they did to their audiences in Leipzig and Dublin.  Don't let modern symphonies puff them up into bloated and ponderous Wagnerian extravaganzas.   They've gone too far, Swafford asserts.  In her opinion, recent performances of early music are too fast and too thin, especially at points where Baroque composers explore serious themes of death, sin, tragedy and betrayal.  Only a slower, richer sound can give voice to the dark side of human existence.  Swafford recalls one performance of the  Mass in B-Minor  in which Christ practically "trotted to Golgotha, pumping his cross."  Ouch!  She names names, John Elliot Gardiner, among others, whose interpretation of  St. Matthew's Passion  comes in for a drubbing.  ( I happen to own that CD.)  Why this blitzkrieg through Baroque music?  Swafford blames the influence of rock-and-roll, and a culture that cannot bear to be serious.  Case in point:  the memorial service in New York following the attack on the World Trade Center.  No mourning, no lamentation, just a whole lot of booty-shakin.  So there's two points:  1.  Baroque music needs a fuller, slower sound than the early music enthusiasts are allowing it to have, and 2.  American music in general reflects a cultural discomfort with negative emotions.  As to the first point, let me offer a naive (some might say ignorant) defense of Gardiner's  St. Matthew's Passion  .  It's the only version I'm well-acquainted with, and listening to it certainly doesn't leave me wanting to "make lemonade out of lemons."  The music drives me to sorrow, pity and dread as it paints a portrait of Christ's death on the cross.    Guilt as well.  I remember Jesus's words from Luke's gospel to the mourners along the way to Golgotha, "Weep not for me, but for yourselves."  It's not only sorrow for the death of Jesus, but sorrow for my own complicity in his death.  That's what Bach, being a good Lutheran theologian, is really trying to do--prick the conscience, deflate the pride in the listener.  But Bach (even as interpreted by Gardiner) doesn't stop there.  Pity for Christ and sorrow for my sins also awaken a bittersweet love for Christ and joy in the midst of his tragic death.  Consider this bass aria, "Mache dich, mein Herze, rein":   Make me clean, my heart, from sin I would my Lord inter. May he find rest in me, Ever in eternity, His sweet repose be here. World, depart; let Jesus in!   Here there is an aching, sensual longing for union with Christ.  Not sexual.  But one cannot hear this music without  desire  being awakened in the heart of the listener for the one who was crucified.  And the Gardiner  Passion  does all this for me.  If I had made my first acquaintance with this work through another composer's interpretation, would I find the Gardiner version lacking?  Perhaps.  Would I be moved to greater sorrow and greater desire for Christ by another composer's take on it?  Maybe.  But in my naivete, the Gardiner  Passion  seems to succeed for me precisely when Swafford says that it ought to fail.  Swafford is more on-target with her general observation that popular music lacks seriousness, and Americans lack the ability to deal with serious emotions.  I see this in the way the living approach funerals.  These days everyone demands a funeral that is "a celebration of life."  Open caskets are out.  Cremation is in.    It's not limited to funerals.  Modern Christians squirm at those old revival hymns that soak the singer in the blood of Jesus.  Psalms of lament have been expunged from the church's "canon within the canon."  Liberals want good moral exhortation from the gospels, and conservatives want good moral exhortation from the pastoral epistles, but nobody wants the sickly, double-crossed psalmist calling down fire from heaven on his oppressors.  Of course Christian worship ought not be maudlin.  But I wonder if calls for "celebrations of life" aren't a denial of death.  The truth is, life is hard.  Nobody is born without the shedding of blood, and the scriptures teach us that being born again means carrying a cross.  God knows we need comfort in this life, and music can do that, but pent up emotions need to be released before we explode.  Some wounds need to be drained.  Music can also do that, express our rage and woe.  If only somebody will sing and play the right music.

       It took me an hour to change the format .  (You're no doubt aware of this if you've been trying to call me.)  My knowledge of HTML code is microscopic.  Anyway, how do you like the new look?    Next up:  email.  My friend  urlLink John Hinkle  can't wait for me to add that feature so he can rip my blog on a  daily basis.  (But, Dear Reader, you should know that John's a fan of  urlLink the only Division 1A school that could possibly be more overrated  than the Wolfpack.)

       With the Roadmap to Peace blown to smithereens , let me put in my two-cents-worth about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  As Rabbi Michael Lerner of  urlLink Tikkun magazine  has pointed out, the current approaches to peacemaking are doomed to fail because they all make a cease fire the  first step.  This puts any peace process at the mercy of the extremists.  Rather than starting with a cease fire, begin at the end.  Put the final outcome on the table, so that moderates on both sides can point to real gains right off the bat.  Lerner's magazine has done just that.   urlLink Click here for their Resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .  A summary:  Israel would return to its 1967 borders, with a nip and tuck here and there to retain control of the Western Wall and Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem.  Some Palestinian refugees would be allowed to return to their ancestral homes in Israel-proper, and the rest compensated by an international relief fund.  A new State of Palestine would recognize human rights.  The Tikkun proposal is not too different from the agreement that the Barak government reached with the Palestinian Authority shortly before the January, 2001 elections that swept Ariel Sharon into power.  The fall of the Labor government and a new round of violence scuttled the plan.  Can that old plan be the basis for a fresh start toward peace?  Not likely unless the U.S. government puts new pressure on the Israelis.  But that would mean the Bush administration risking alienating its fundamentalist Christian base, which believes that the modern state of Israel can do no wrong because it is the lynchpin of end times prophecy.  Would that "Blessed are the peacemakers" carried as much weight with them as bizarre interpretations of Revelation.

       In the runup to the war on Iraq , the Bush administration consistently appealed to the most pessimistic appraisal of Iraq's ties to terrorists and its capacity to wield weapons of mass destruction, and consistently trotted out the rosiest scenarios for rebuilding the country in the war's aftermath.  Since the war the administration has been proven wrong on both counts.  U.S. forces have discovered no biological, chemical or nuclear agents, and U.S. forces have been unable to restore order to Iraq.  The electricity is still out; the oil is not flowing, and a well-organized guerrilla campaign has killed or wounded more Americans since the war technically ended on May 1.   Nonetheless, we've made this bed, and we're going to have to lie in it.  I'm not suggesting that we get out of Iraq, as  urlLink International ANSWER will  in a march in Washington this fall.  We're stuck, and we've got to try to make it work.  So I welcome the President's straight talk last night:  $87 billion to rebuild Iraq; no timetable for the departure of U.S. troops; and new willingness to seek international solutions to the problems in Iraq.  Still, the President could have been straighter with us.  He could have said, "We were wrong."    Better yet, he could have said, "We knew things would likely go this way, but we decided not to tell you going in because you never would have gone along with it, but we knew that once we were in, you'd have no choice but to stand with us," a statement that's probably closer to the truth.    Just as criticizing the administration's war rationale doesn't mean I think we should get out now, so too thinking that we shouldn't get out now doesn't mean I think this administration ought to run the rebuilding effort any longer than necessary.  They've lied, exaggerated and bungled enough to be shown the door next November.

       A Sunday evening miscellany...  The right says that Howard Dean is too hot.  Guess what?  They also say that  urlLink John Kerry is too cold .  When will the settle on a Democrat that's just right?  Don't hold your breath.   urlLink I warned you about Wake Forest .  Here, Tolkien has convinced me that I should remain a small church pastor:       Already the Ring tempted him, gnawing at his will and reason.  Wild fantasies arose in his mind; and he saw Samwise the Strong, Hero of the Age, striding with a flaming sword across the darkened land, and armies flocking to his call as he marched to the overthrow of Barad-dur.  And then all the clouds rolled away, and the white sun shone, and at his command the vale of Gorgoroth became a garden of flowers and trees and brought forth fruit.  He had only to put on the Ring and claim it for his own, and all this could be.        In that hour of trial it was the love of his master that helped him most to hold firm; but also deep down in him lived still unconquered his plain hobbit sense:  he knew in the core of his heart that he was not large enough to bear such a burden, even if such visions were not a mere cheat to betray him.  The one small garden of a free gardener was all his need and due, not a garden swollen to a realm; his own hands to use, not the hands of others to command.   And speaking of Tolkien, I found another word,   puissant  .  It means powerful, as in, "You desired the love of Aragorn.  Because he was high and puissant..." said Faramir to Eowyn.  "But you lost out to an Elf chick.  And I'm about to be dethroned as Steward of Gondor, a title I've held but mere days.  We're a couple of also-rans to the thoroughbreds in this epic.  Hey, we're made for each other!"  So the not-as-puissant-as-Aragorn Faramir wed the not-as-concupiscible-as-Arwen Eowyn.  And they lived reasonably happily ever after.  (The rest of that paragraph was me, not Tolkien.  I'm still trying to find my saga-like writing voice.  And you'll have to look up  concupiscible  yourself.)

      I can tell I'm getting older.  No really!  In my twenties, if I wanted to drop five to ten pounds, all I had to do was up my running mileage for four to six weeks.  Presto!  More room around the waistband.  Now that I'm in my thirties it's not so easy.  My father-in-law brought a bunch of old  urlLink Runner's World  magazines to our family beach vacation in June.  I devoured them.  Photos of Kenyans with ropy, muscular legs crossing the finish line first.  Helpful articles like, "Ten tips to boost your endurance."  Etc., etc.  Man, I was pumped up after reading one inspirational running story after another!  I've been very good since then--running five days per week.  But my pants are still a wee tight.  Is it getting older or having kids?  After Ethan and Andrew leave the table I finish off their leftovers.  I can't stand seeing good food go to waste!  Perhaps I should start wrapping up their plates instead of cleaning them.  I'm in good company.  Obesity is a national epidemic.  And have you noticed the increased press that's accompanying our increasing waste lines?  Last week, NPR's  Talk of the Nation  devoted a whole episode to the politics of fat.  A New York state assemblyman wants to tax junk food and use the proceeds to fund healthy eating initiatives.  Everyone has a theory about why so many people are overweight.  Larger portions in restaurants.  Saltier, more sugary foods.  (Like an addict that needs more and more of a drug to get a fix, we need food that's more and more shocking to our taste buds in order to like it.)  Too many children playing too many video games.  Even suburban sprawl has been indicted.  Given our zoning laws and the proliferation of roads, one has to drive everywhere.  If only our communities were laid out more like Europe, where a little drug store and grocer are a brisk walk from home, then we'd get more daily exercise.  I have my own theory.  I think that two parents working means that there's no time for anyone to cook a decent, healthy meal at home.  So Mom or Dad runs by McDonald's on the way home from work, and the family plops down in front of the TV set and gobbles up their Quarter Pounder.  Then homework, bath and bed, and another 1/4 pound added to that pauch underneath your rib cage.    Could it be that all these factors are at work?  If so, that's a disturbing finding.  In short, being an average American is hazardous to your health.  If husband and wife working 80 hours per week combined in order to afford a Sega, TVs for every bedroom, and a house on an isolated cul-de-sac with no sidewalks (and no place to go on them even if they were there) results in colon cancer, heart disease or stroke, then just what's so good about this so-called good life?

        The Passion , Part Two:   More speculation on what I've heard, and not seen.   The Passion  is reputed to do for Good Friday what  Saving Private Ryan  did for D-Day--shock the viewer with a graphic depiction of the gruesome violence of that last day in Jesus's life.  This concerns me more than the reports that  The Passion  may be anti-semitic.    The Jesuit theologian Jon Sobrino has complained that Christianity has morphed into a cult of suffering rather than maintaining itself as a cult of those who follow Jesus.  If  The Passion  gives us no context for the gory end of Jesus's life--his associations with social outcasts, his teaching that one should love one's enemies, his civil disobedience in the temple which sealed his fate--then the (Christian) viewer will be left with gratitude that Christ suffered so much for his/her sins, but will miss the fact that Christ has bequethed to his followers a lifestyle of resistance to evil that may lead to a similar end.  Will  The Passion  give us a Jesus who was "born to die," so to speak, or will it give us a Jesus who died as the result of the life he lived, a life that was sharply critical of the religious vision of the leaders of his time?  If the latter, will  The Passion  help us make connections to our current context?  WWJD, for instance, in the temples of contemporary American religion?  Who are the outcasts that Jesus would be-friend today?  And who is Caiaphas today?  Jerry Fallwell?  Jesse Jackson?

      Too bad that Mel Gibson's  The Passion  isn't on the big screen yet.  In my sermon series on the Apostles' Creed, I'm slogging through the "crucified, dead and buried; he descended into hell" clauses, and I sure could use a sermon illustration or two!  The movie's already earned a bad reputation.  Some charge that the movie is anti-semitic because it blames the Jews for Jesus's death.  Good Friday was the favorite day for pogroms in medieval Europe.  Christian preaching has all too often equated the Jewish religious leadership that handed Jesus over to the Roman authorities with all Jews everywhere.  One can understand that Jews and Gentiles who are sensitive to past wrongs might view  The Passion  with their anti-semitic radar turned up high.  Still, how could one make a film about the end of Jesus's life as recorded in the gospels that didn't render some Jews complicit in his crucifixion?  Imagine trying to make a movie about the end of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s life that didn't point a finger of blame at any white people.  I haven't seen the movie.  But I wonder if people aren't over-sensitive, and I wonder if there's a political agenda behind the hyper-sensitivity.  Since the second intifada began three years ago, any criticism of Israel has been equated with blessing suicide bombings.  So if you believe that it's wrong that the Israeli government bulldozes entire blocks of Palestinian homes just because one home in the neighborhood harbored a militant, then you're an anti-semite.  If you think that the daily humiliations that the Israeli army visits upon Palestinians at military checkpoints (such as denying people safe passage to hospitals for dialysis treatment or to give birth), then you're a stooge of Hamas.  And if you make a movie that besmirches the reputation of a long dead Jewish High Priest, then you probably support driving all the Jews into the sea.  All this is speculation.  I haven't seen  The Passion , and I'm not sure anybody's seen the final version.    But from what I've seen of Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, there's plenty of room for criticism.  And criticizing the Israeli government is not anti-semitic.  If that were the case, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Micah and Amos would be the world's greatest anti-semites.

      Now that the  urlLink Friends 4 Friends  dinner is behind us, and The Two Towers is out on DVD and video, my fantasy interests have turned from Potter back to Tolkien's trilogy.   I spent Labor Day weekend reading  The Return of the King .  The first time through I read at a breakneck pace, so desperate was I to discover the fate Mr. Frodo and the Ring of Power.  This time around I'm proceeding at a more leisurely pace, leisurely enough to accomodate a dictionary at my side.  Tolkien was a philologist by trade, so he was quite a wordsmith, and not only when it came to inventing an elven language as background for his Middle Earth epic.  He can handle English pretty well too.  I'm learning a lot of new words.   Fey , for instance, which means "fated to die soon," or "sensing imminent death."  It may also mean, "appearing as if under a spell:  Enchanted."  Then there's the word  fell , used as an adjective.  "Inhumanly cruel," it means, or "capable of destroying."  Not to mention "sharp and biting."  Tolkien returns to these words in the grim pages of  The Return of the King  because, though the men of Gondor and the Riders of Rohan survive many fell blows from the servants of Sauron, fey is their mood as they increasingly realize the magnitude of the power arrayed against them.  Now, to work these wonderful words into my pedestrian writing.  How's this?   A fey cloud gathered in the office of Tommy Bowden after the fell Bulldogs cruelly defeated the Tigers upon the gridiron floor of the Valley called Death.  The shoe contract, the summer coaching clinic, the prestigious coaching job at a historic football school, all crumbling into dust, like the slag sliding down the face of the Ered Luthui, the very teeth of Mordor.    Not bad, eh!  I can't wait to call up the  urlLink Packman  this afternoon and let that one fly!

       Happy Halloween!   Laura has taken the kids trick-or-treating, leaving me home, in my post-wisdom teeth stupor, to hand out candy.  Speaking of wisdom teeth, I had to go back to the doctor this morning.  The hygenist stuffed some medicated gauze into my sockets.  The pain's gone, but there's a revolting taste in the back om my mouth.  Now you know.  Our friend Susan Knapp wrote an op-ed piece for  The Mooresville Tribune  complaining that the fundamentalists have ruined Halloween.  Time was, Halloween was an opportunity for neighborhoods to come together.  But now everybody goes off to their church's "fall festival," safe from occult influences and terrorists who might be handing out smallpox infested candy.  I agree with Susan that Halloween is about dressing up and sugar, not about Satanism.  There's enough real Satanism in the world (adultery, domestic violence, embezzlement, materialism) to obviate looking for it in my two kids dressed up like construction workers and begging for candy.   And Happy Reformation Day!   It was on this date in 1517 that Martin Luther posted his 95 theses on the Wittenburg, Germany church door.  Seeing the movie  Luther  would be an even better was to celebrate October 31 than trick-or-treating or attending some church's fall festival.     urlLink I've already commented  on the fine performances by Peter Ustinov and Joseph Fiennes in  Luther .  But I do have a quibble with a couple of points that the movie makes.  In the moviw we see back-to-back sermons by Luther and the indulgence salesman, Johann Tetzel.  Luther admits that he used to be afraid of God, but faith in Jesus Christ (faith alone in him), assuaged his guilty conscience.  Tetzel lights a fire in a city square and sticks his hand in it long enough to sear the skin, reminding everyone of what's in store for them unless they purchase an indulgence from the church.  It's not as though Lutheranism is a religion of love, and Catholicism is a religion of fear.  Luther himself believed in hell, and (sadly) thought that it was full of Jews and Turks.    For Luther, the question was, "How can I find a gracious God?"  The late medieval church told him, "Do your best, and God will make up the difference."  One could access God's grace that "makes the difference" through the ministrations of the church:  confession, pennance, communion, the purchase of indulgences, etc.  For an earnest monk like Luther, this answer proved unsatisfactory.  How could you ever know when you had done your best?  As Luther "advanced" in Christianity, he didn't get closer to God, he just became more and more convinced of the depth of his sin.  He wound up hating God for demanding the impossible of him.    Then he read Romans:  The just shall live by faith.  Grace is not for those who do their best and fall short; it is GRACE; it is a sheer gift from a gracious God to those who can't fall any further.  We need Luther's insight more than ever.  I think I saw somewhere that most American Christians (wrongly) believe that the saying "God helps those who help themselves" is in the Bible.  The understanding of grace in that aphorism is exactly what Luther was trying to overthrow when he posted his theses on the Wittenburg door.    It may be that Luther's theology is best preserved not in churches (even Lutheran ones) but in 12 step programs.  You don't become a member of AA by trying to stop drinking and asking for God's help.  You become a member of AA by confessing that you can't stop drinking because you're a slave to the demonic power of alcoholism.     Mutatis mutandis , sin and grace.  The path to salvation doesn't begin by trying to be good and trusting God to bridge that last gap between us and him.  It begins when we admit that it's going to take a miracle for people like us to be saved, and trusting that God in Christ has performed just such a miracle.

       The groggy blogger:   I had my two lower wisdom teeth pulled yesterday.  How'm I doing?  Not bad.  When I take the pain pills I can open my mouth enough to eat.  The down side is that I'm having a hard time staying awake.  So I will write until my head hits the keyboard.  If it lands just so, maybe this entry will be published rather than deleted.   I'll say it again.    There is no curse, there is no curse, there is no curse.   There are teams that wilt under pressure (Boston in Game 7), and teams that don't (Florida in Game 4).  There are managers who know their pitchers better than they know themselves (Josh Beckett getting the call in Game 6), and managers who don't (leaving Pedro in in Game 7).  Much more comforting to curse the gods than to look at yourself in the mirror.   If you're thinking about voting for a newcomer  in the City Council election, Mark Lewis is worthy of your consideration.  Lewis has served for a long time on the planning board, and he attends every City Council meeting.  He's already in the know.  Lewis thinks it's urgent that the new Council fully implement the Vision 2020 plan, lest Salisbury become a just another smog-ridden, traffic-congested tumor spun off from a metastasizing Charlotte.  The other challengers scorn the present Council's interest in beautification and buying abandoned properties for re-development.  They fail to understand that a good city is more than ultra-low tax rates.  Sign ordinances, tree planting programs, new parks, historic preservation, and wise planning and zoning are key to making Salisbury a great place to live, not just a cheap place to live.  The Vision 2020 plan is an aesthetic as well as materialistic vision for Salisbury's future.  Lewis, and the present members of the City Council who crafted the plan, are to be commended for thinking holistically.  Too bad we can't add Lewis to the five who are already serving.   John Edwards is getting glowing reviews  from the press, if not the polls.   urlLink Slate's William Saletan writes  that if Edwards isn't the Democratic nominee, then whoever is ought to steal his message.  Edwards argues against the Bush tax cuts on moral grounds.  By shifting the tax burden away from investments and inheritances and toward ordinary income and dividends, Bush has declared a war against work.    That message may resonate with blue collar, rural voters.  Normally, these folks vote Republican because pro-choice, pro-gun control Democrats appear at odds with their values.  But hard work is also a virtue with folks in flyover land.  If Edwards can make the case that Bush doesn't share their values on a basic issue as the worth of hard work, then that spells trouble for the President's re-election hopes.  Saletan makes similar points in  urlLink this article  he wrote last summer for Slate.  And the witty conservative pundit  urlLink David Brooks concedes  that Edwards, who never misses a chance to tell you that his daddy worked in a mill and he made his money defending ordinary people against rapacious corporations, doesn't come off as an elitist, the way so many liberals do.  Elitism, says Brooks, was what doomed Al Gore in 2000.  Remember his condescending sighs during that debate with Bush?  I'm inclined to support Edwards in the Democratic race, and not just because he's from North Carolina, and a graduate of N.C. State.  Howard Dean is fun to listen to, but his constituency--birkenstock wearing, Ben and Jerry's eating, Volvo driving, Berkeley-eduated Vermonsters--is as high on the elite scale as you can get.  Sharpton, Kucinich, and Moseley-Braun aren't serious.  Lieberman may as well be a Republican.  Everybody likes Wes Clark, except all the people he worked with at the Pentegon, and that worries me.    That leaves Kerry and Gephardt.  But Gephardt wants to repeal all the Bush tax cuts, even the more progressive cuts like the new child tax credit.  And his health care plan, to the extent that it relies on mandates for big corporations, probably won't be worth the huge cost.  I can't tell much difference between Kerry and Edwards, except that Kerry has a military record, but Kerry is a Boston Brahmin if there ever was one, and that brings us back to the elitism factor.  So it's Edwards for me.

      I haven't followed the Salisbury City Council race very closely, but after reading  urlLink today's Post  I can only say, My loss!  What scintilating political debate I've missed out on!  What erudite ideas for our community's well being have been uttered, and I have deprived myself of the opportunity to ruminate upon them!   Take this one from candidate Bob Boone:  Salisbury's problem is that it doesn't have its own identity.  The solution?  Get our own area code, a different one than Charlotte.  The man is thinking big.  Why, as soon as that plank on Mr. Boone's platform is established, we'll have to dial ELEVEN numbers to reach Charlotte, unlike those chumps in China Grove who only have to dial ten.  Now that's really distinguishing yourself from the rest of the pack.  I see even bigger and better things in store for Salisbury during "the Boone years," as we'll look back on them and call them.  Like getting a brand new zip code too.  I favor the first three characters being SP1.  That would cement our relationship with our sister city, Salisbury, England, whose postal code also begins with SP1 or SP2.  Plus, we'll be the only place in the U.S. with letters in our zip code.  You couldn't get more different than if the entire city council pierced their tongues!  Seriously (somewhat), my wife did point out one advantage to a new area code.  If Salisbury ever has a Reuben Studdard-like star on American Idol, he/she can make our area code famous.  And we won't have to share the glory with Gastonia.

      Random Wednesday:  The  Luther  reviews are in.   urlLink Roger Ebert complains  that the Reformation leader "seems weak, neurotic, filled with self-doubt, unwilling to embrace the implications of his protest... an apologetic outsider with low self-esteem."    Sorry Roger, but that's the real Martin Luther.  The movie is pretty true to life when it shows a frightened Luther almost muttering incomprehensible replies to the prosecutor at Worms, and raging in his cell in the middle of night.  Raging against who?  God?  The devil?  His own conscience?  It's hard to tell, but the real Luther was so convinced of a real, personal Devil that he saw him from time to time and even threw ink wells at him.  If Roger Ebert wants to watch a movie about a cocksure religious leader, he'll have to wait for Mel Gibson to make a movie about the pre-Vatican II popes.   Repeat after me:    There is no curse.  There is no curse.  There is no curse.   There are just shortstops who boot double play grounders, and managers who don't know when to go to the bullpen.   urlLink Scott Fowler is so right.   Whoda thunk that the November 23 game between the Cowboys and the Panthers would be a showdown with all sorts of playoff implications?  This is why the NFL is so much better than Major League Baseball.  Is anybody astonished that the Yankees are up 2-1 in the World Series?  Is anybody surprised that the Chiefs and the Vikings are the only undefeated teams in the NFL?  I'm so glad we're beyond last week, and I can go back to hating baseball.   More sports silliness:   I'm in Raleigh grading ordination exams (someday I'm going to explain to you what that is), and I see Roy Williams on Channel 5 whining about how much he misses KU, and an ECU fan calls in on 850 the Buzz to say that N.C. State fans ought to be crying about the ACC letting in another football power in Boston College.  Roy's homesickness is not really my problem, but man, if I were a Carolina fan, I'd have put my Tar covered heel through the TV screen watching that junk.  And ECU fans?  ECU had to play a service academy to get its first win of the season.  They ought to be on talk radio probation until they beat somebody.  Much better to live in the Charlotte media market.  Even Clemson fans aren't as ridiculous as that.  Oh, wait.  I was supposed to have given up on sports.  Think I will again.  And this time I mean it!

      How does one think theologically about  urlLink the tragic murder of Tracey Helms?   Helms invited a co-worker, Holly Wright Blout, to live at her home after she left her abusive husband, Michael William Blount.  Helms and Blount returned to Helms' home at 2:00 AM after their shift was over to find Michael Blount waiting for them in the driveway.  When Helms ran for the door, Mr. Blount bludgeoned her to death with a shovel, kidnapped his wife and released her later.  Mr. Blount is now in jail.  Tracey Helms leaves behind a husband and two small children.  They were asleep in their home, unaware that their wife/mother was being murdered in their front yard.  When I saw the Helms family picture in this morning's paper, I was angry--at God.  Our clerk of session, who also serves on the board of directors of our local domestic violence agency, reminded us that this past Sunday was domestic violence awareness Sunday.  He invited the congregation to attend a candlelight vigil for victims of domestic violence on Monday evening.  During the prayers of the people, I prayed for shelter and safety for victims of abuse and repentance and new life for the perpetrators.  And then God allowed this to happen?  Where was God in that early morning?  Was anybody listening when we prayed for people like the Helms family and the Blount family?  I didn't want to read the article.  I knew that it would be filled with tear-jerking anecdotes about the deceased, but I forced myself, and I was glad I did.  Tracey's husband commented that the death of his wife had given Mrs. Blount a new lease on life.  I remembered Jesus' words, "No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends."  Is that where God was--incarnate in the friendship one woman extended to another in need?  A candidate for ordination preached the sermon at today's meeting of Salem Presbytery.  Her text was Genesis 1.  She remarked that the statement "and God said" turns up ten times in the creation story.  From there she moved into the topic of--domestic violence.  The preacher contrasted the good things that come into being from God's word with the damage that results from our hurtful words and deeds.    We took communion.  Intinction was the method.  I dipped my chunk of bread into the wine with my left hand, and held my right hand underneath it.  Grape juice stains are hard to clean, and I didn't want to drip anywhere.  Some juice would up in my right palm.  I thought about Tracey Helms.  I remembered that Jesus too died a violent death.  Looking at the juice in my palm I reflected on his call to take up a cross and follow him.  I pondered the fact that what happened to Jesus and Tracey Helms can potentially happen to anyone who confesses faith in Jesus.  Am I trying to make sense of a senseless act of violence?  I don't know what motivated Tracey Helms.  Was she a Christian?  Was she a good humanitarian?  Was she just naive?    I wonder why, with all the suffering in the world, that God decided to save the world through yet more suffering--God's only son nailed to a cross.  Why doesn't God (if God is God) just wave a magic wand and make it all go away?  Paul was right.  The word of the cross was a scandal to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles.  I find myself scandalized by the notion that Tracey Helms had to lose her life in order that Holly Blount could have hers saved.  Some good has come from this.  The Union County domestic violence agency is re-doubling its efforts to advertize the presence of a battered women's shelter in that community.  Still, I am scandalized that it had to come to this to make us more aware of domestic violence in this "Domestic Violence Awareness Month."  "A scandal to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to us who are the called--Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God."  Going back to where I started, to the question, "How does one think theologically about the murder of Tracey Helms?"  I find myself as nonplused as a Greek listening to one of Paul's sermons.  It makes no sense.  But if I were in danger, I'd want a friend like Tracey Helms, and if a friend of mine were in danger, I'd want to be the kind of friend that Tracey Helms was to Holly Blount.  I trust that the Word and Sacrament I shared in today can do that.  Maybe where understanding falters, the sacrificial love of God poured into our hearts can take over.

      I got back from grading ordination exams to find my beloved Presbyterian Church (USA)  urlLink torched on the opinion page of The Charlotte Observer .  Rabbi James Rudin has taken Presbyterians to task for pouring over 300K into a new church development in Philadelphia whose target audience are Jews.  I wondered if this could be true; maybe he'd mistaken the PC(USA) for the more evangelical Presbyterian Church in America, but the Rabbi is right.  You can read a news story about it  urlLink right here.   The pastor is a Jewish convert to Christianity who has longed dreamed of establishing a Messianic Jewish congregation.  The church observes both Jewish and Christian holidays.  The architecture leans Jewish.  Menorahs are more prominently displayed than baptismal fonts.  Rudin charges that the new congregation is a wolf in sheep's clothing.  The pastor of the church and presbytery officials insist that they are translating the Christian gospel into the culture of the people who they are trying to reach.  So we have contemporary worship for unchurched suburbanites and Torah scrolls for Philly's secular Jews.  More importantly, Rudin argues that the new church development is at odds with the Presbyterian Church's official position on Jewish-Christian relations.  He cites a paper adopted by the 1987 General Assembly which affirmed that both Jews and Christians are called to be a light to the nations; both Jews and Christians are in a covenant relationship with God, and that the idea of supercessionism--that the Church has replaced Israel as God's chosen people--ought to be rejected.  What do I think about this?  Well, I do believe that Jesus is the Messiah of the Jews, and when I was ordained I took a vow affirming that Jesus is "Lord of all."  I assume all means both those who acknowledge his Lordship, and those (like non-Messianic Jews) who don't.  Our Brief Statement of faith affirms that the Holy Spirit empowers us to "witness to all peoples to Christ as Lord and Savior."  Again, all means all.  So I think that this new church development is a great idea?  Not so fast.  Christians cannot think about our relationship with Jews and Judaism in a doctrinal vacuum.  There's an ugly history of Christian anti-Semitism that has to be reckoned with.  For about 1,500 years Jews living in Christendom have been subject to discrimination, forced conversions and genocide.  In fact, until the creation of the state of Israel in 1947, Jews living in the Islamic world probably lived quieter, safer lives than did Jews in the allegedly civilized west.  Jews remember this history, even if Christians would rather ignore it or gloss over it.  Jews cannot help but view evangelistic outreaches toward them in light of this nasty past, and its a pretty recent past, all things considered.  I think that listening earns you the right to talk.  Perhaps if Christian preachers are able to go the next 1,500 years without inciting their congregations to violence against Jews, and if Christian businessmen are able to go the next 1,500 years without discriminating against Jews in the workplace, and all Christians spent the next 1,500 years listening to the testimonies of Jews about the God whom they serve, THEN we can talk to them about who Jesus is for us.    In the meantime there are a ton of unchurched gentiles in Philadelphia, and even more in the rest of the world.  Let the Presbyterian Church (USA) plow its dollars and cents into reaching them.  After all, the apostle Paul says that God has ordained that the Jews not accept Christ as Lord and Savior for the express purpose of facilitating a mission to the gentiles (Romans 11: 28-29).  Let's make the most of God's plan.

      The worship wars have come to Salisbury--literally.  Today's Post included an article titled "Crossroads Community Church invades Salisbury" about a new congregation in town.  Crossroads is keeping it real with blue jeans, guitars, "futuristic" 3x5 info cards, Power Point, and great visual effects.  One Sunday, at a key point in the sermon, some guy covered in red food coloring, hanging on a cross, and wearing something that looked suspiciously like a pair of Depends, was unveiled to the congregation.  If you're tired of irrelevant churches, then Crossroads is for you.    Or is it?  Despite the Crossroads people's repeated insistence that they are all about being "authentic Christians," the article presents a much clearer vision of the congregation's style than their substance.  There's not one word about how these people build strong marriages, serve the poor, observe an "authentic" sabbath or promote social righteousness.  Crossroads' preocupation with music genre and clothing fashions is every bit as shallow as the traditionalist who insists everyone wear ties or hose to worship and sing hymns with Bach harmonizations.  Besides, it isn't all that "contemporary."  In the photo that ran with the article, the song on the Power Point display was the 19th century "Amazing Love."  Are unchurched people really so prissy that they'll sing a hymn on a screen but not out of a hymnbook?  And as for the guy hanging on the cross--worshippers have been viewing images of the crucified Christ since the High Middle Ages.  Dude, you're so  Medieval !  Shoot, in the Philippines on Good Friday, some flagellating Catholics actually have themselves nailed to crosses for a short time, for penance.  If you want to keep it real, next time use real nails.  A church that strives for cultural relevance alone needs to count the cost.  Pop culture discards the new for the very new with Darwinian ruthlessness.  The guitar-heavy worship at Crossroads is probably already passe.  Last week, every single on Bilboard's Top Ten List was by a black musician, something that's never happened.  I say, ditch the guitars, move in some turntables, and hire a "liturgist" with that Eminem gift for gab.  Two verses of scripture have helped form my own theology of worship.  One is Matthew 13: 52, "Every scribe trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is old and what is new," and the other is 1 Thessalonians 5: 19, "Do not quench the Spirit."    One, newcomers to the faith ought to be made to learn the classic music that has glorified God and built up the saints who've gone before us.  You don't do any unchurched people a favor by hiding "A Mighty Fortress" or Handel's "Messiah" from them.  And the old timers ought to be made to learn good new worship music.  It cannot be that case that Christian music turned to ashes after you graduated from Sunday School.  And two, the worship style ought to emerge from the gifts of everyone in the congregation.  So if you have a drummer in your congregation (as my congregation does), you ought to work in "contemporary" and other music that can make use of a drum set.  If you have a few teenagers who are in marching band and orchestra (as my congregation does), they ought to be given a chance to use their gifts in worship, even if they attend a "contemporary" church which has to bend a bit to accomodate a clarinet and a trumpet.  Authenticity is all about loving in truth and action, not word and speech (1 John 3: 18).  You show me a church where people put love into action, and I'll show you a relevant church, no matter what they're wearing or what they're singing.

       Random Friday :  My three-year-old son learned the phrase "poopy juice" at preschool.  Now where's the number of that home school coordinator?  Next year, President Bush wants to win Florida fair and square-- urlLink with shameless pandering and pork barrel politics for special interests.   Everyone's drooling about a BoSox-Cubs World Series.  The irresistable losing force meeting the immovable pathos-filled object has managed to kindle interest even in baseball-loathing Yours Truly.    All I can say is, "You better be careful what you pray for; you might get it."  Suppose Chicago meets Boston in the fall classic.  One team will find relief for a century's worth of pent up tension.  The other team will sink to depths of fan despair not yet plumbed.  But what next, especially for the winning team?  Suppose the Red Sox win the World Series, but ten years from now they've failed to win it again.  A losing season here, a wild card there, even a division championship once or twice.  In 2013 there'll be nothing special about being a Boston fan.  No Curse of the Bambino to add an extra dose of melancholy to a blustry autumn day.  The Red Sox faithful will have departed their baseball Via Dolorosa to walk in the pedestrian paths of Phillies fans.  Or Orioles fans.  Or Mariners fans.  Nothing exquisitely bittersweet about that.

      I fixed my youngest son's breakfast this morning.  "Andrew," I said, "do you want your shredded wheat with milk or without milk?"  He replied, "With milk."  No sooner did I pour the milk over his cereal than he looked up at me with quivering lip and tear-filled eyes.  "I don't WANT milk on my cereal!"  he whined.  I fixed him another bowl and thought to myself, If you were of voting age in California, I know which lever you'd have pulled on the recall.

       The Passion, Part Four :  Peter Boyer has written a long, thoughtful review of Mel Gibson's  The Passion , and the furor surrounding the movie, in the September 15  New Yorker .  According to Boyer, a working group of Catholic and Jewish scholars got wind of Gibson's project, and offered their services as consultants.  Gibson refused.  Then a screenplay turned up on the doorstep of one of the scholars, in an unmarked manilla envelope.  He shared the screenplay with his colleagues, and most were aghast at what they read.  Some went public with their concerns, which drew an angry rebuke from Gibson who (correctly) pointed out that they were in possession of stolen property.  With the movie drawing such negative scrutiny, Gibson's associates realized that the movie would succeed only if commited Christians turned out in droves to see it.  So over the summer they've screened the movie for a select few religious leaders:  Robert Schuler and his entourage, a group of Jesuit priests, conservative cultural critic Michael Medved, a gathering of the Knights of Columbus.  All loudly endorsed the movie and condemned the critics.    These private viewings also increased the buzz surrounding the movie in Hollywood.  Stars hate not being in on something.    So the result is that a movie that's not even scheduled for release until next spring is the most talked about event in town.  Not bad, Mel!  Is the movie anti-Semitic?  Boyer concludes that the movie is literal portrayal of the death of Jesus as recorded in the gospels, uninformed by modern scholarship.  It befits Gibson's traditionalist Catholicism.  It is certainly true that the gospel accounts have been used for anti-Semitic purposes, so one might say that the movie is naively anti-Semitic.  Then again, I haven't seen the movie.   A postscript :  I tried to find Boyer's article on the web, but all I could find was a transcript of his interview with Bill O'Reilly here.   urlLink Read it here .  I've never cared too much for the gotcha brand of punditry that shows like  The O'Reilly Factor ,  Hardball  and  Crossfire  engage in, but they're even worse in print than they are on the screen.  Reading the transcript you can see just how shallow, thoughtless and rude these so-called journalists really are.

      Some of us took in the new movie about Martin Luther, titled, simply enough,  urlLink Luther .  Here are a few first reactions:  There were a myriad of factors that led to Luther's break with the Roman Catholic Church:  German nationalism, Luther's own failure to find peace with God through the ministrations of the Church, the intellectual influence of his Augustinian brothers, especially Johannes von Staupitz, and his own study of the New Testament.    The movie compresses all these influences into one scene, Luther's trip to Rome.  We see the young monk, played by Joseph Fiennes, taking his turn viewing the skull of a saint on display in a Roman church.  As Luther studies the relic, Fiennes wears an expression of curiosity that flickers between hope and skepticism.  Next we watch Luther crawl up the steps of the Sancta Scala on his hands and knees reciting the Lord's Prayer, in order to free his grandfather from purgatory.  At the top, Luther turns around to survey the mass of wretched humanity crawling up behind him.  The clergy in elegant attire taking names and coins at the base of the stairs also catches his eye.  The look on his face is unmistakable--righteous indignation.  The church ought to be shepherds to these lost sheep, Luther thinks, but they're ravenous wolves devouring the flock.  Luther did visit Rome, and the experience pained him, not least because of the unbridled immorality of the city.  Years later Luther recalled that when he got to the top of the Sancta Scala he "wondered if it all were true," if God's mercy could really be at the beck and call of these ecclesiastical tricks.  What's amazing is that Fiennes is able to communicate Luther's growing fury and doubt without recourse to dialogue.    Peter Ustinov also shines in the role of the Elector Frederick.  The German prince who protected Luther from Rome, Frederick also maintained a vast collection of relics.  Ustinov plays the enigmatic Frederick just right.  In one scene, Frederick is perusing his relic collection while deliberating with his assistant, Spalatin, what to do with his radical theologian who, among other things, raves against relics.  He's been asked to hand him over for trial (and certain execution).  Frederick explains to Spalatin the different ways that one can say No to a more powerful opponent.  The irony of the whole scene is delicious, and captures the complicated nature of the German prince whose affable exterior masked a clever political mind.  In short, it's a well-acted movie that, for the most part, is true to the story of Luther's life.  If you know nothing about the founder of the Protestant Reformation, you'll learn a lot from  urlLink Luther , and if you're already familiar with his life, you'll appreciate how the actors bring a long and complicated story to life within the confines of a two hour motion picture.

      Today on the Ivy Bush--an editorial page worth reading.  Check out  urlLink The Charlotte Observer's opinion section .  A couple of entries are worth mentioning.    First, the  urlLink Observer's editorial board  waxes nostalgic for that by-gone era when State, Carolina, Duke and Wake played and hated only each other.  But the ACC is expanding, and in the new and improved league, the Big Four might be carved up and parceled out among two different divisions.  I hate the thought of State and Wake not playing each other at all in football, and perhaps just once per season in basketball.  Unlike the State-Carolina rivalry, when it comes to the Demon Deacs, I can be complimentary in defeat and magnanimous in victory.  But just take a look at the ACC football standings, and it's obvious why the league needs to expand.  The rumors of Florida State's demise were, as they say, greatly exaggerated.  It's shaping up to be business as usual, with the Seminoles running the table, and three or four teams tied for a mediocre second place.  Tech whips Auburn, who, in turn, defeats the mighty Volunteers, but Tech can't beat Tommy Bowden's utterly fraudulent Clemson Tigers.  State falls one bad call short of upseting the defending national champions on the road, but the Wolfpack can't beat a Wake team who lost to the middling Purdue Boilermakers.  Yes, Virginia is unbeaten in league play, but I'm skeptical about a team that goes down to defeat against the lowly Gamecocks.  The ACC is incapable of growing a championship football program.  My SEC friends are right:  the ACC is a pigskin joke.  If it wants to be a football conference, it'll have to steal a few good teams from other places.  Sorry, Observer, but the ACC has to grow or die.    Second up,  urlLink no sooner do I rip Cal Thomas  than he writes a column that makes me eat crow.   urlLink This one  contains a lot that I agree with.  In short, Christians tilting at Ten Commandments windmills, and entrepreneurial pastors building megachurches that resemble corporations more than the  corpus Christi  are a sign that American Christianity has been seduced by the world.  If the church doesn't willingly embody what Stanley Hauerwas calls a "contrast society," then how can we expect the government to implement our moral vision by force?  Thomas' comments on the disappearance of hell from American religious thinking merit further consideration, in light of  urlLink the new movie about Martin Luther .  But that will have to wait for another entry.

      I surprised myself the other day.  I walked out of Blockbuster with the   8 Mile   DVD.  I know as much about Eminem as most over 30 people do, which is to say that I'm appalled by the gross, misogynistic lines he raps.  But I'd overheard a person or two say that   8 Mile   wasn't a bad movie, and I wouldn't have expected that opinion from those people.  Plus, the theme song got quite a lot of airplay earlier this year, and I'd grown to like it (it was fairly clean by Eminem standards).  So I took a chance.  To tell the truth, it's a pretty good "inspirational story" genre movie.  Eminem plays himself--a role that suits him well.  Like Keanu Reeves, Eminem has got two facial expressions down pat--dumbfounded and determined.  He's broke.  His friends are losers, harmless, but losers.  He's had to move back in with his mother (Kim Basinger) who's getting it on with a guy Eminem went to high school with.  (An aside--why is it that everyone in motion pictures who lives in a trailor has a southern accent, even in Detroit?)  Girls two-time him.  Big-mouthed "agents" betray him.  Thugs beat him up.  But thanks to hard work, and trusting no one but himself, Eminem exorcises his demons and triumphs at the end.  The way he turns the tables on his competition can only be described as an excellent example of Pauline "boasting in weakness" (see 2 Corinthians 10-13).    8 Mile   is not not a clean movie, but the music is actually free of the grime that landed Eminem in such hot water in the leadup to the Grammy Awards a few years ago.  In fact, there's one scene where the notoriously homophobic Eminem comes to the defense of a gay co-worker with a few well-chosen lines.  Check it out.

      I'm blogging from the office computer while down the hall the stewardship committee debates my pay for the coming year.  I've closed the door and turned the radio on just to make sure that I don't inadvertently overhear anything.  This somewhat awkward moment reminds of a column Peter Feuerherd wrote for  Commonweal  about the Catholic sex abuse scandal.  The author criticized calls for strengthening lay boards as a means of protecting children.  Feuerherd said that this "Power to the people" solution would have unintended consequences, such as muzzling the prophetic voice of the priesthood.  He recalled a racial controversy in a Midwestern city a few decades back.  The priests of the city were much stronger advocates for racial justice than the Protestant ministers because, Feuerherd suggests, priests served as the pleasure of their bishop, not their congregation.  Feuerherd writes, "There's enough cozy, smarmy sermonizing already.  You can only expect more with a system of lay boards ruling parishes.  Within such a system, you will pretty well forget raising unpopular themes..."  Suppose it's the hierarchy that needs to hear a prophetic word more than the laity?  Suppose that bishops and bureaucrats conspiring to advance the careers of pedophilic priests is a more pressing problem than racial prejudice in the pews?  Feuerherd's preference that priests be accountable to bishops rather than lay boards doesn't free the priest to preach prophetically; it merely frees him to criticize the laity rather than the hierarchy.  How much "prophetic preaching" has filled the air of Catholic sanctuaries regarding the sex-abuse crisis?  How many priests have taken their bishops to the rhetorical woodshed for their criminal lack of oversight?  One wonders.  Since Feuerherd argues by anecdote, let me offer one of my own:  Shortly after 9/11 I concluded, with no small amount of dread, that I had no choice but to declare my pacifist opposition to the war in Afghanistan in my monthly column for  The Charlotte Observer .  I gave the Session a heads-up.  One elder said, "Don't worry about it.  We expect you to say things that will challenge us."    My experience of preaching in three different Presbyterian congregations is that parishioners would rather be mad than bored with the sermon.  They give the pastor an awful lot of license from the pulpit.  Now if you don't show up when someone's in the hospital... well, that's a different kettle of fish.  Besides, priests like to be liked as much as anybody.  The fact that the people he's seeking to please can't fire him on the spot doesn't mean that he's not all too willing to pull his homiletical punches, if not out of fear of punishment, then in hope of some other form of reward.  If seldom is heard a prophetic word from the pulpit, it has less to do with who hires or pays the preacher, and more to do with the preacher and the pew-sitters' joint faith that "the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword... And before (the Word) no creature is hidden, but all are naked and laid bare to the eyes of the one to whom we must render an account"  (Hebrews 3: 12-13).

      No sooner had I finished the Old Testament reading in the Daily Lectionary than my wife marched in the door of my study.  "When you get home you've got to read the article about Wal Mart.  This is going to be like going vegetarian--a major lifestyle change--but from now on, I'm never shopping in that place again."  The article to which she refers is one in a three part series written by a pair of  L.A. Times  reporters.   The Charlotte Observer  ran the first installment this morning.  You can read it  urlLink here .    In short, the article chronicles Wal Mart's ambiguous and enormous impact on the U.S. economy.  Everyone loves shopping at Wal Mart, and why not?  The stuff's dirt cheap there.  That's no accident.  Founder Sam Walton made billions, yet he never gave driving a beat up old pickup truck.  That penny-pinching attitude permeates the company.  Executives don't fly first class, and managers are under pressure to wring every last cent of productivity out of their stores.  There's a dark side to Wal Mart-style thrift.  The corporation's strong arm tactics forces vendors to shift production overseas so that they can make products cheaply enough to sell to Wal Mart.  Wal Mart employees don't make a living wage, unlike employees of rival grocery store chains.  Indeed, the on-going strike affecting several California grocers is really about whether or not Wal Mart will set the (ultra-low) wage and benefit standard for grocery stores in that region.  Lastly, Wal Mart seems to be engaging in illegal activity in order to keep costs low, forcing staff to work overtime without pay, and hiring illegal aliens.  My wife's attitude is, "If everything's so cheap at Wal Mart because they're stiffing their employees and suppressing the standard of living in entire communities, I'm not going to shop there anymore."  This isn't the first time she's voted with her wallet.  When she became aware of how factory farming was polluting the environment, running small farmers out of business, and subjecting livestock to a miserable existence, she gave up meat.  We regularly buy organic produce from a local farmer.  It's more expensive than the non-organic stuff shipped from South America to Wal Mart (or any grocer, for that matter), but we feel better about spending the extra dollar when it means that fewer chemicals are used on the land and less gas is burned bringing to our home.  You, Gentle Reader, might raise any number of objections to our Wal Mart boycott.  You might say it won't make any difference.  Not to Wal Mart it won't, but to us it will.    You might say, all the other stores out there are just as bad.  There's no pure exchange of money, so why worry?  True.  I'm a Reformed theologian.  I believe in total depravity.  I've read enough of  urlLink Moral Man and Immoral Society  to know that there's no pure safe haven to flee to in this world.  Although boycotting Wal Mart may make me feel a bit better, it's not really about my purity.  It's about making a statement about what a sound economy is (not).  Lastly, you might respond with, "That's fine for you, but you can afford to shop at Harris Teeter.  Some folks can't."  That argument misses the point.  If folks can't afford to shop anywhere else other than Wal Mart, maybe it's because Wal Mart's gargantuan economic impact and ruthless cost-cutting is driving down the standard of living everywhere.  But if you want to know why we're really going to avoid that big box off East Innes Street, it's this:  Remember that Old Testament passage I was reading when Laura flew into my office this morning?  It was Amos 1 and 2:   Thus says the Lord: For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment; because they sell the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals...   One man's coincidence is another man's sign from God.

      Hunting Island, South Carolina is becoming one of my favorite places on God's earth.  It's located southeast of Beaufort in a region of the South Carolina Lowcountry that the tourists and yankees haven't conquered--yet.  The drive down U.S. highway 21 still looks like most anyplace in the southeastern coastal plain.  Little brick ranch houses already decorated for Christmas line the road, along with trailors, cows, large fields standing empty now but which were filled with watermelons when we passed them in June, and massive live oaks stretching over the highway to shade us from the sun.  No golf courses, no condos and no newly incorporated "towns" that are really just subdivisions full of half-million dollar homes.  What's the City Hall in these new municipalities anyway, a broom closet at the rec center?  Autumn, such as it is, has arrived down there.  I saw one or two greenish-yellow sweetgum trees tucked in between the palms and the long leaf pines.  Oh yes, there was a muscadine vine creeping up a tree whose leaves were definitely yellow.  It was a little incongrous to be eating Thanksgiving dinner with your view of the ocean slightly obscured by a palm tree, but I got over it quickly.  But when you're dining on "unturkey" (wheat gluten and tofu really) what's a little more incongruity?  The best views aren't oceanfront.  In this part of South Carolina the Atlantic doesn't have the good sense to stop where the continent begins.  It oozes inland for miles and miles.  The back side of Hunting Island opens up to a vast salt marsh.  Endless  spartina  grass, green in June when we were last there, now golden brown in late November.  Like Kansas at Memorial Day and then three weeks later.  Kingfishers zipping around and announcing their presence with a loud zippy rattle.  We took the kids on a nature walk down a boardwalk into the marsh, and Ethan proclaimed that his favorie part of the whole trip.  I fell in love with the salt marsh when I fell into it, literally, while on a field trip in the seventh grade.  It stinks, and it can't make up its mind whether it's dry land or not, but the salt marsh is a wondrous incubator for aquatic life.  Fish lay eggs in the marsh.  Other eggs get carried in by high tides.  There, hidden from predators by the grass, the baby fish grow and eventually return to the ocean.  Mother Nature's womb--the salt marsh.  We should allow that more than a few young fish get picked off by the egrets who sneak through the grass and strike when they see movement, but the egrets are just doing what comes naturally.  Dumping motor oil down the drain that runs into the marsh, now that's another matter.  The baby fish ought not to have to put up with that.    While trying to head off a riot in the back seat this afternoon, we brought up the subject of Thanksgiving.  "So what are you thankful for?"  I asked the kids.  Ethan said, "For God's whole world."  Amen.  And for the South Carolina lowcountry, especially.

      Just found the link.   urlLink Here it is.   (See entry below for an explanation).  And you're never going to believe this.  There was always one line in that song that was unintelligible to me.  Now, 20 years later, I understand for the first time that they were singing about ME!   Listening to  Marvin  all night long This is the sound of my soul This is the sound...   OK, so it was probably Marvin Gay.  But now I know why I REALLY can't forget that song.  One more disclaimer:  This is not my favorite 80s pop song.  Just my favorite MAUDLIN 80s pop song.  World of difference in those two categories.  Happy Thanksgiving.

      The blog is slowly getting into shape.  I'm not happy with the colors, and I have yet to pay Blogger fifteen bucks to get rid of the banner ad, but we're making progress.  Question is, How seriously do I want to take this blog?  The time I spend fiddling with the template is time I could be spending reading or doing something else worthy of commenting on in my blog.  Alas, style is triumphing over substance.    I'm adding links of interest to my side bar.  Please note the new "Favorites" category.  The favorite theologians are not, strictly speaking, theologians.  One's a farmer, and the other's a composer.  Yet, in the words of Karl Barth, a genuine, bona-fide theologian (and a dead, German-speaking one at that):  "We can even dare to say that every Christian - in however primitive and rudimentary a way - can and must be a theologian, and that no matter how primitive and rudimentary he can and must be a good theologian, having a true vision of the One in whom he believes, having true thoughts concerning him and finding the right words to express those thoughts."  (Thanks to the  urlLink Scandal of Particularity  blog for the quote.)  So why can't a crazy man from the Bluegrass state who still plows his fields with mules be a theologian?  And as for the composer--all I can say is that nobody can make you feel sorry for your sins and absolutely adore Jesus like Mr. J.S.B.  More favorites are to come.  As soon as I decide which novel is, in fact, my favorite, I'll add that category.  One category that's sure to debut soon is  "Favorite Maudlin 80s Pop Single."  You'll see it as soon as I find a link to the lyrics of Spandau Ballet's "True."  Yes, I admit it.  Are you man enough to admit that you can't get "Wanna Be Starting Something" out of your head?

      Drat!  I'll be away from a computer when the new, post-Wacko-Jacko-booking edition of  urlLink The Onion  goes online.  But how can I complain, spending Thanksgiving Day at  urlLink Hunting Island State Park ?  I can't wait to see what kinds of birds show themselves at the beach in late November.  Naturally, the Laughing Gulls won't be as spectacular as usual, having shed their black heads for drab winter plummage.  But I'm hoping to spy some interesting species migrating through.  (And I'm not talking about turkeys).

      The human rights violations perpetrated by U.S. troops in Iraq that  urlLink CPT has documented  pale in comparison to what  The Toledo Blade  has uncovered about "Tiger Force," an elite U.S. Army unit that went on a rampage in Vietnam's central highlands 36 years ago.  According to  The Blade , this unit killed hundreds of innocent men, women and children.  They threw hand grenades into underground bunkers where women and children cowered.  They shot peasants who "looked at them wrong."  They cut of the ears of their victims and make necklaces out of them.  The Defense Department thoroughly investigated the Tiger Force and concluded that there was sufficient evidence to convict soldiers of war crimes, but no one was ever prosecuted.  President Ford and Defense Secretary--Donald Rumsfeld--decided that the wounded nation didn't need another painful expose of U.S. atrocities in southeast Asia.  You can read the entire grisly series  urlLink by clicking here .  This is news to you, right?  Mysteriously, many national media outlets have declined to pick up the  Blade's  first rate and explosive investigation.  Eric Alterman (see link at right) has repeatedly questioned why  The New Times  has ignored the story, especially considering the fact that the foreign daily,  The International Herald   Tribune , has run the story, and the  Tribune's  owned by the  Times .   urlLink ABC did follow up  on  The Blade's  investigation after the Defense Department announced that it would reopen the case.   The Blade  reporter that broke this story spoke to NPR's   urlLink On the Media   today.  He speculated that the national media hasn't trumpeted his story about old war crimes because we're in a brand new war, and the media are under tremendous pressure to "support the troops."  And he added a thoughtful observation about an change in media coverage of the war in Iraq.  Embedded reporters, he said, would certainly reduce the risk of war crimes being commited by the units that they're assigned to.  Yet there are no embedded reporters in the units that are currently conducting operations against the Iraqi guerillas.  Is it better TV to have a reporter in a tank riding to Bagdhad than it is shadowing American soldiers when they  urlLink tear up somebody's home ?    If you say you're for Just War, then you should be hopping up and down by now, demanding to know more about ear-removing GIs in southeast Asia and the bullies who are tearing up the homes of ordinary Iraqis.  The Just War Doctrine claims that even in war, there are rules that have to be obeyed.  Specifically, the targeting of innocent civilians is prohibited.    If you shrug your soldiers and want to give these soldiers the benefit of the doubt, then do you also shrug your shoulders at the fellow citizens of your community suspected of dealing drugs, battering their spouses and breaking into people's homes?  If "supporting the troops" mean turning a blind eye to war crimes, then let us "support our citizens" by turning a blind eye to that crack house around the corner or that child with the black eye.  Tell the truth, if we can shrug our shoulders at gunning down farmers innocently working in a rice patty, why can't we shrug our shoulders at suicide bombings or using airplanes as projectiles?  Remind me again how We are different from They.  My sources,  The Toledo Blade  and Christian Peacemaker Teams, are not household names.  If one has to get this far off the beaten path to learn the unpleasant truth about some of the actions of some of our soldiers (note the word "Some") then what does that say about the national media's coverage of the military?    It say two things:  1.  Bush is wrong.  The media is not painting an overly ugly portrait of Iraq.  The media is actually sitting on a lot of information that would make things look even worse in Iraq.  2.  Bush is winning.  To quote Alterman, Bush and his allies in the conservative punditry are  urlLink working the refs , whining about media bias, and getting a cowed media to look the other way and call the game their way.

      I mentioned taking in Pippen, didn't I?  The sets and costumes were anachronistic and fun.  I can't wait to see Eric Abbott to ask him what was churning in his mind when he created  urlLink those costumes .  The denim jackets with the anarchy symbol took me back to the smoking patio in high school, but the bare midriffs were definitely turn of the millenium.  Think "Brittney Spears goes to the Headbanger's Ball."  Plot summary:  Charlemagne's son Pippen is dissatisfied with life.  He wants a "meaningful," exciting life.  He becomes a soldier, but that life's really more for his father and brother.  Next he tries his hand at debauchery, and then politics, and then domestic living.  Nothing satisfies, until the end when Pippen must choose between going out in a blaze of glory or the extraordinariness of an ordinary life.  "The extraordinariness of an ordinary life."  In Pippen's case, it's fixing a leaky roof and consoling a little boy when his pet duck dies.  (The actress playing the dying duck stole the show.  I hope I see her in the movies one day.)    How I wish I'd seen this play twelve years ago!  I'd have saved myself a lot of existential angst.  I have slowly learned that you don't have to be on the barricades somewhere to do the Lord's work.  Just trying to react calmly to an autistic toddler is more than enough "peace and justice" work for one day.

      Seth Holtzman, who teaches philosophy at Catawba, invited me to speak to his Environmental Ethics class about religion and the environment.  He was nice enough to share some of the course readings that pertained specifically to religion and environmental ethics.  Not surprisingly, the Jewish authors had the best stuff.  Why?  Their ethics rise out of a close reading of Biblical texts.  They don't posit a vague definition of "justice," and then apply that to the environment, as liberal Protestants do.  I've often thought that liberal Protestants need to learn to read the Bible more like Jews in order to return to the  sola scriptura  Reformation spirit.  But now I'm off the track...  Anyway, one thing that Christians can learn from Jews about the environment is a proper interpretation of Genesis 1:28.  What does it mean that humans "have dominion" over the earth?  That we can dispose of the environment as we see fit?  Some do take the scripture to mean just that--a license to rape, loot and pillage.  "Dominion," however, is a political term.  The medieval Jewish philosopher Maimonides pointed out that kings exist in order to restrain theives from breaking in and stealing.  Exercising dominion over the creation, then, means RESTRAINING the exploitation of the earth.  Using Genesis 1:28 to authorize human domination of the planet is an abuse of the text and our authority.  We become to the planet what Robert Mugabe, Saddam Hussein or Augusto Pinochet are to their people, tyrants whose exercise of political authority is merely organized thuggery.  Thus, Factoid One is:  Dominion does not equal Domination.  Dominion equals Defending the Creation.

      Hooray!  The Senate mustered up the collective courage to say no to welfare for Big Oil.  They've fillibustered the new energy bill to death.    This is not a victory for Democrats.  Minority "Leader" Tom Daschle, in a stupendous abdication of leadership, had supported the bill.  Being from corn-rich South Dakota, and facing re-election next year, the bill's massive new subsidy for ethanol was too much for Uncle Tom to say No to.  Why didn't he vote against the bill, go home and tell his farmer constituents, "Look.  Whatever money you make on ethanol you'll just have to hand back over to Uncle Sam in tax breaks for Exxon-Mobil and Tom DeLay and George Bush's other cronies in Texas."  Sigh.  Seven Republicans joined most Democrats to stop the motion to limit debate.  Good for them.  They're the real Republicans, the No Pork, No Giveaway, No Cronyism Republicans.    Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Catawba College and local bankers are putting together  urlLink a new initiative  to clean up Rowan County's air, the worst in the state.  Altogether, it's been a good week for the environment, for a change.

      I'm in a dark and silly mood.  Probably because I saw   urlLink Pippen   at Catawba last night.  How's this for lullabies at Neverland?   'Cause it's the Thriller Thriller night And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike...   Or,   I wanna rock with you All night...   I can hear Wacko Jacko on the stand, proclaiming his innocence:   Bille Jean is not my lover He's just a boy who thinks that I am the one   Think ahead, 8 to 15 years from now.  MJ is out of prison.  He's giving the obligatory interview to Barbara Walters.  You know, the first step in rehabilitating himself in the public eye.  Everybody does it.  Nixon (well that was with David Frost, but you get the point), Monica Lewinsky, etc., etc.  My God, how old will Barbara Walters be then?  At any rate, Michael might croon,    I'm talking with the man in the mirror I'm asking him to change his ways...   Brings tears to my eyes.

      At the Christian Peacemaker Team site (see link at right), I found  urlLink not one , not  urlLink two   but  urlLink three accounts  of human rights abuses by U.S. soldiers in Iraq.  I am emailing CPT to find out what American citizens can do to vindicate these victims of the U.S. occupation.  I'll let you know what I find out.  It's probably easy to dismiss these reports as either lies or isolated incidents.  As to the former, the CPTers are fine, competent Christians who can be trusted to get the facts and report them straight.  As to the latter, I wonder if the recent surge in anti-American violence in Iraq can be attributed to a pacification policy that's finally got Iraqis fed up.  If these people weren't behind the insurgency before now, what will these strong arm tactics do to their loyalties in the future?

      The court's decision is bad news for Democrats.  A basklash is sure to happen, and Howard (I signed a same sex unions bill a long time before the Massachusetts Supremes got into the game) Dean, the likely Democratic nominee, will bear the brunt of it.  Richard Nixon ran a "AAA" campaign against George McGovern, slamming him as a supporter of Acid, Amnesty and Abortion.  You can expect Karl Rove to launch a similar culture war blitzkreig against Dr. Dean.    It'll probably work.  But then again it won't.  Nixon won re-election but four years later abortion was legal and draft dodgers had--amnesty.  (Don't know what happened to dropping acid.  Maybe you old folks can tell me).   Mutatis mutandis , same sex marriage.  The younger you are, the more likely you are to support gay rights.  George Bush may well be re-elected, even as changing demographics roll back legal and social barriers to full civil rights for homosexuals.

      The Massachusetts Supreme Court decision endorsing gay marriage is an oddly conservative verdict.  I have often heard heterosexual, cohabitating couples say, "What's the big deal about marriage?  It's just a piece of paper.  A silly ceremony doesn't make a marriage."    Try telling that to homosexuals.  They've been shacking up for years, and they're fed up with those arrangements.  Marriage IS a big deal.  It does confer certain rights, but the "piece of paper/silly ceremony" also helps solidify the relationship.  The court ruling elevates marriage, in a strange and probably unintentional sort of way.    Moreover, gay bashers can't castigate the homosexual community for promiscuity and simultaneously condemn the court's decision.  If gays and lesbians are so promiscuous, why do they want to get married so badly?  There's more to it than not getting to visit your partner in the hospital because, under the law, you aren't "family."  But if the verdict is oddly conservative,  urlLink it is relentlessly libertarian .  "It is the exclusive and permanent commitment of the marriage partners to one another, not the begetting of children, that is the sine qua non of civil marriage," said the court's Chief Justice.  For the court majority, marriage is just another contract that any two people are entitled to enter.    That minimalist definition of marriage is a far cry from "The Statement on the Gift of Marriage" that I usually read at wedding ceremonies.  Taken from a  urlLink Presbyterian liturgical resource , it states that marriage is an institution ordained by God, rooted in our creation as sexually differentiated beings, for the well-being of human society, for procreation, for mutual aid, and to mirror the relationship between Christ and his Church.    The Massachusetts Supreme Court appears willing to let anyone marry anyone, but unwilling to give them advice on what constitutes a good marriage.  There are exceptions, of course.  I assume that adultery is still recognized as a legitimate grounds for breaking the marriage contract, even in libertarian Massachusetts.    For today, I'm not interested in arguing the morality/immorality of homosexuality.  I'm more interested in thinking about what the new libertarianism means for Christian mission.  We Christians need to be mindful that we have a far more robust vision of the good life than the secular authorities are willing to enshrine in law.  That means we will have to be far more intentional in Christian education.  If no one's willing to say what a good marriage is, then Christians will have to say it, if we want our children to have a reasonable shot at getting into a good marriage, and if we want them to have the strength and wits to work through the crisis points in marriage.  The argument also extends to economics.  The government is increasingly unwilling to take our money (taxes) to ameliorate social ills (maintain the welfare state).  If the government isn't going to say what constitutes generosity, mercy and economic justice, then the churches will have to say it.  Sadly, we're not doing such a good job with that.  How is it that thousands of Mecklenburg County taxpayers got checks from Uncle Sam this summer, but donations to Crisis Assistance Ministry remained flat, even during a time of unprecedented demand for services?  PS.  Speaking of sex, you mean to tell me that there are still parents out there letting their kids  urlLink sleep over at Wacko Jacko's house ?  I say, Lock up Mom and Dad too, for flat-out stupidity.

      "Pacifists are parasites," is a common charge leveled at advocates of nonviolence.  "It's hypocritical," the critics say, "to sit back in the comfort of your own home and complain about militarism when military might provides you a safe place to speak your mind."  You can make that argument against some pacifists, but not against the Jewish scholar Ezra.  In the 5th century BC, Ezra, with the blessing of the King of Persia, led a delegation of exiled Jews back to Jerusalem to re-establish obedience to the law of Moses in the city.  (I've been poking around this more obscure era in biblical history thanks to recent selections in the  urlLink daily lectionary .)  But before they set out they fasted and prayed for safe travel.  Why?  "Because," says Ezra, "I was ashamed to ask the King for a band of soldiers and cavalry to protect us against the enemy on our way, since we had told the king that the hand of our God is gracious to all who seek him, but his power and wrath are against all who forsake him" (Ezra 8:22-3).  Here is a non-parasitic and theologically sound pacifism.  Ezra and his entourage put themselves at risk, making a long journey along a road stalked by bandits without benefit of a security detail.  They do so because they believed that reliance on the sword would undercut their claim that their God protects the innocent and punishes the guilty.  A modern-day Ezra is the Christian Peacemaker Team volunteer I heard at last summer's Presbyterian Peacemaking Conference (see link at right).  He stated that the world will not have peace until peace advocates take the same risks that soldiers do.  CPT sends teams of pacifists into war-torn regions to expose human rights violations and engage in nonviolent direct action to challenge unjust political and economic systems.  Both Ezra and CPT volunteers challenge armchair peaceniks to get off their duffs and stick their necks out.  But Ezra also represents a profound challenge to Christians who endorse violence.  If we believe that God in Christ has defeated the powers of sin and death, and that Jesus Christ is coming to renew the creation, then why do we pick up the sword from time to time?  Doesn't our recourse to violence say something very different, namely, that it's up to us and not God to save the world, and that we really don't have much faith that eternal life awaits us beyond death?  Ezra was no doctrinaire pacifist.  He and Nehemiah the governor were instrumental in the reconstruction of the city wall.  In other words, they made sure Jerusalem was battle-ready.  But none of us are doctrinaire pacifists.  We are born into and are socialized by a violent world that is shot through with violence.  The important thing is that violent people (meaning all of us) occasionally take risks and step out in faith.

      It's been a FANtastic fall.  Both my teams play exciting football, and one, the Panthers, even manages to win consistently.  How ironic when #71 for the Wolfpack blocked that field goal try at the end of regulation to force overtime with Florida State.  It was the second time that one of my teams had gone down to Florida and blocked a kick to extend the game (remember Carolina at Tampa Bay in Week 2?)  I took that as an omen of success, but I took the wrong omen.  I should have remembered State's double-OT loss to Ohio State, for that's what happened.  The Seminoles beat us in the second extra period.    "When will State ever get over the hump?"  a parishioner and I wondered yesterday.  What does it take to get from "slightly above average/second and third tier bowls" to "well above average/ranked in the Top Ten/BCS bowl more often than not?"  A healthy, sure-handed TA McClendon wouldn't hurt.

      Our younger son is named for an apostle.  Sadly, the gospels give Andrew the Galilean fisherman short shrift.  About all that we know of him is that he was Simon Peter's brother.  I was pleased to see his name crop up in yesterday's  urlLink gospel lesson , and I'm happy to report that a book I'm skimming has filled in a few missing details about now our second-born's namesake.    In  urlLink Eastern Orthodoxy Through Western Eyes , author  urlLink Donald Fairbairn  states that in his missionary work in the former Soviet Union he heard numerous stories about the "facts" that the apostles Andrew and Simon the Zealot preached the gospel in Georgia in the first century.  The Ukranians fondly remember Andrew as well.  It is said that he journeyed to the hills on which the city of Kiev would be built and blessed them.  Some Ukranians also believe that a cathedral in Kiew was built by God the Father himself at the request of the Virgin mary shortly after the creation of the world.  So it looks like we still know very little about the Apostle Andrew, and a lot more about the wishful thinking of Georgian and Ukranian Orthodox Christians.  Sigh.    Still, I may yet encourage my younger son to major in Russian, go to work for the State Department or some multi-national corporation, and "find himself" in the former Soviet Union if he can't find himself here.  Or maybe I'll simply encourage him to read more Dostoevsky.

      We have a new energy policy!  And said energy policy may be the last tremor in an earthquake that's been rattling the political landscape for the past twenty-five years.  First the details of the bill (they're awful), and then the overall political implications.  If you like pork barrel spending, smog, gas guzzlers and emergency rooms packed with asthmatics, then this bill's for you.  The Senate wanted $16 billion in tax breaks for energy companies.  The White House wanted $8 billion.  So they compromised--on $20 billion.  I just luv that Beltway math!    The bill requires no increases in automobile fuel efficiency, an easy way to get more fuel and cleaner air.  In fact, the bill gives smoggy regions like the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex more time to clean up their air.  I guess this is "favor" to the President's home state, although the beneficiaries are the few executives in Lone Star companies that are polluting the air, not the many children and senior citizens who are sucking wind on a 95 degree red alert afternoon in Irving.  They couldn't have written a worse bill if they tried, except for the fact that there's no provision to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  This bill is welfare for Big Oil and Big Utilities.  It's a stimulus package, for haze and smog.    And it helps redefine the Republican Party as the true "liberal" party in American politics.  My dictionary defines "liberal" as "tending to give freely, generous; generous in amount, ample."    Now which party is the "liberal" party, the party who's energy policy calls for more mining and more drilling on more public lands for more gas, more coal, and more oil, whose policy will result in more burning of fossil fuels and more ozone and smog, OR the party whose policy calls for conservation (related to the word "conservative") of natural resources?  Which is the true liberal party, the party that bequeathed a balanced budget to the Republic, or the party that plunged the Republic back into red ink in just a couple of years?  Who are the true liberals?  The folks who are profligate in their distribution of tax breaks to wealthy individuals and big corporations, or the folks who resist such giveways?  Is it liberal or conservative to haul off and invade a country on the mere suspicion that it might be up to no good?  Is it liberal or conservative to restrict the use of military force to situations where there is an immediate threat to the Republic, its vital interests or the lives of innocent cvilians?  No doubt about it.  If you're a liberal; you're a Republican.

      Athletic conferences are like women.  They're more alluring when they're taken than when they're available.  How else do you explain Notre Dame's  urlLink latest overture  to the ACC, weeks AFTER the ACC completed its expansion drive by adding Boston College?  Or maybe the Fighting Irish figure that BC has made the ACC, long a bastion of Baptists (Wake), Methodists, (Duke) and godless secularists (everybody else), safe for Roman Catholicism.  One thing's for sure--if the ACC makes it a baker's dozen by adding Notre Dame, it won't be to shore up its strength in football, as was the case with the last three additions.  "Duke with gold helmets," says  urlLink the Packman  about Irish football.  Ouch!  I took the "War Is Not the Answer" bumper sticker off my car today.  Not that I disagree with that statement.  But I'm tired of saying "I told you so" about the Iraq War.  I was against the war, chiefly because I thought we couldn't win the peace.  The current situation vindicates me, though that brings me no joy, especially considering that a son of our congregation may be deployed to Iraq next spring.  But rather than debate the wisdom of going to war seven months ago, we need a debate on how to stabilize Iraq now.  Problem is, there don't seem to be many good solutions.  The Democrats clamor for more international cooperation, but the Turks, the Pakistanis, the South Koreans and the Japanese are all balking.  With good reason; what's the upside for those countries to put their soldiers down in the middle of a guerilla war?  John McCain says we need more troops in Iraq; Jim Leech says we need to be completely gone by the next inauguration.  Who's right?  I know who's wrong, the President for saying that the situation's normal, and the media's just a bunch of gloomy Guses.  These insurgents are better at shooting down U.S. helicopters than the Republican Guard was.  Things are not hunky dory in Iraq.  P.S. If you're of a different mind, you can order a "War Is Not the Answer" bumper sticker  urlLink here .  It's finally cold!  Yesterday's wind evicted any recalcitrant leaves from their perches.  I love these brisk days with bright blue sky, and the vivid contrast between light and shadow when the low afternoon sun casts long shadows behind the bare trees.  Finally, the Bedside Manner of the Year Award:  Laura's grandmother, born June 3, 1913, got her pneumonia shot today.  Helen remembers that it was exactly ten years ago when she got the last one, because the nurse who administered it chirped, "This is the last pneumonia shot you'll ever need!"  Remember boys and girls, when the doctor diagnoses you with terminal cancer and you want to know how much time you've REALLY got left, ask the nurse.  She'll tell it to you straight.

      While puttering around the  urlLink Hood Seminary Library  I came across a fascinating article in the new  urlLink Scottish Journal of Theology  on John's Calvin's theology of the Lord's Supper.  Calvin is chiefly remembered for denying the real presence of Christ in the Lord's supper,  contra  the Roman Catholics.  But this article argues that Calvin did affirm a real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and thought of the believer's communion with Christ in the Supper in mystical terms.    Calvin believed that in the event of Communion Christ descends to his disciples and lifts their souls into heaven to be with him and more conformed to him.  What was the basis of this thinking?  For Calvin, the Genesis story of Jacob's ladder is a shadow and form of what takes place in the Lord's Supper.  Calvin himself once had a strong, mystical experience, which he described in terms that Paul uses in 2 Corinthians where the apostle speaks of being "snatched up into the third heaven,"  and Calvin uses the same language to talk about the believer's experience of Christ in the Holy Supper in the  Institutes .  I dare say that Calvin's theological children do not understand the Lord's Supper in these terms at all, as an event in which our souls are literally transported to heaven when Christ, the host of the Lord's Supper, comes and fetches them.  But recovery of this theology of the Lord's Supper may be helpful for the revival of 21st century Reformed and Presbyterian churches.    So many people are abandoning Christianity for eastern religions or new age religions because they are craving an experience of the divine.  Yet all they get in conservative Christian churches are fossilized doctrines to which they must bow the knee, whether they understand them or not.  Liberal churches are no better.  Instead of God, liberals give them a to-do list of left wing causes.  Christian rituals and liturgy have the capacity to ignite a lively spirituality in the hearts of believers, if only we will let them.  In my last communion sermon I stressed the ethical implications of the Lord's Supper.  I said that "Discern the body" means to forgive and seek forgiveness from fellow Christians before approaching the table.  But the Lord's supper is also literally "com-union," a joining together with Jesus Christ, the GodMan.  Let's not jetison the experiential for the ethical alone.

      Sadly, we have veterans of a brand new war this Veteran's Day, 2003.  What shall we call this war/these wars?  The Afghanistan War?  The Iraq War?  The Second Gulf War?  I suppose we could lump it together under the title "The War on Terrorism."  But that's a dubious rubric.  One can draw a straight line between the attacks on New York and Washington and the war to overthrow the Taliban and kill or capture Al Qaeda fighters operating in Afghanistan.  The line between September 11, 2001 and the continuing bloodshed in Iraq is a squiggly thing.  The rationale for war rested on this three-legged stool:  1.Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, in defiance of U.N. resolutions.  2.Iraq was cooperating with Al Qaeda, and we couldn't let Iraq slip WMDs to the terrorists,  3.Replacing Saddam Hussein with a democratic, multi-ethnic state in Iraq would be the first step in democratizing the Middle East, a reverse of the old "Domino Theory."  Time has not been kind to that stool.  Legs one and two have been knocked out by the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  Leg #2 was always a rickety support.  There was mutual loathing between the secularist Saddam and the fanatics in Afghanistan.  But in post-war (can we really use that term?) Iraq, Baathists and Al Qaeda operatives have joined hands, on the principle of "the enemy of my enemy is my friend."  In short the war, which was supposed to disrupt cooperation between Saddam and bin Laden, has actually facilitated cooperation between these erstwhile enemies.  So it was not too surprising that the President highlighted reason number three in his speech last week.  With the exception of George Will and a few liberals like Tom Friedman, this reason didn't get a lot of enthusiastic support in the runup to the war.  Career diplomats at the State Department doubted that we could impose democracy in Iraq by force.  Old line conservatives who decry "nation-building" had no use for going to war unless our vital interests are at stake.  But, lacking any weapons of mass destruction, democratizing Iraq is the only reason left for us to be there.  That, and the fact that if we pulled out now, there would be a nasty civil war on top of the world's second largest oil reserves.  Afghanistan all over again.  I wonder if the soldiers serving in Iraq understand their service there in terms of bringing democracy to the Middle East?  They know, better than we do, that Operation Iraqi Freedom is not a "Mission Accomplished."  But, as they are stalked daily by an increasingly sophisticated coalition of guerillas, do they think that Operation Iraqi Freedom is a Mission Impossible?

      Someone from Charlotte's Crisis Assistance Ministry told  urlLink WFAE  today that they are out of federal emergency assistance money.  They have been slammed this year.  Now the cupboard's bare going into winter, when people need emergency utility assistance the most, but there's no more money in in the pipeline in the near future.  It's strange to me that the federal government can part with billions of dollars in inheritance taxes, but can't come up with sufficient dollars and cents to tide over mill workers and middle managers who've lost their jobs in this alleged "recovery."    You can count on this administration to look out for the people who are really hurting in this economy:  the "overtaxed" overclass.

      The Black Knight vindicated himself at the joust.  I'm sorry; you were thinking football; I was thinking Ren Fest.  We had a ball.  My Cardinal costume went over quite well.  A jester sought my blessing, and a couple of wenches begged my forgiveness, which I was only too happy to bestow.  There's nothing like wearing a miter to make one feel magnanimous!  Crazy.  It's 4th and 1; the Bucs need a touchdown, and Gruden sends Johnson rolling right to hit--WARREN SAPP?  That's a Playstation call.  And we still won the game, on the strength of Delhomme's arm, no less?  Crazy.  My wife is sooooo right.  We got the Duke game out of the way just in time.

      This morning I preached on "the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting."  I tried to make the point that Christians hope for more than "life after death."  We look forward to a transformation of the created order.  We hope for every injustice to be put right.  We are confident that the God will free the creation from its bondage to decay (Romans 8).  That means new, glorified bodies for us, incapable of dying, capable of loving God and neighbor perfectly.  In short, what God did for Jesus that first Easter Sunday God will do for the whole world, one day.  After church, I opened the paper to an article on pet grief.  In light of my sermon I couldn't help but ponder that question every parent dreads, "Mom, is Sparky in heaven?"  I don't know if Sparky's in heaven or not.  But there is a cosmic scope to God's new creation.  Humans alone are under the power of sin, but all matter and energy appears to be gripped by death.  If death will finally be destroyed, isn't that Good News for all creatures?  I think we can affirm hope for Sparky too, one that's faithful to the New Testament, and not a mere sop to our tearful kids.

      We're pretty giddy.  Laura ran to Concord to pick up her tickets for The Lord of the Rings three-peat on December 16.  The Fellowship, the Two Towers and the new one--The Return of the King, back to back to back.  The man in the ticket booth handed them to her and said solemnly, "These are extremely valuable."  Laura was kicking herself for leaving the gun in the car (just kidding!)  Mr. Ticket Booth says that these tickets are fetching $500 on Ebay.    Wish I'd bought one!  I thought that $24 for a movie was a tad pricey, even an eleven hour movie.  And I hate staying up late anymore.  How shortsighted.  If I'd bought one, I could replace the garage door with the scalpings and still get to bed early.  Aye, the fantasy spirit is in full effect at the Lindsay ranch.  After Laura returned we ran over to Catawba and rented costumes for tomorrow's Ren Fest.  I, of course, needed something clerical, so I'm going as the Archbishop of Canterbury.  Thank Thomas a Becket, not Rowan Williams.  You should see me in my hat!  And we continue to read a chapter of  Alice in Wonderland  a night to the children.  This is my first trip through this land; can you believe that?  Off with his head!  you say.  I didn't like it at first.  All Alice did was expand and shrink.  I was ready to return it to the library and re-read  The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe .  But the tide turned when we met the Mad Hatter and the March Hare.  The dialogue is ironic, dry and whimsically incoherent.  The plot lurches about like a dream, like pieces of several puzzles jumbled into one box, a true "wonderland."    Still, I must disagree with fussy old Harold Bloom that Harry, Ron and Hermione can't hold a candle to Alice, the March Hare and the Gryffon.  Carroll's dialogue is much cleverer, but the Potter books are a rip-roaring good read.  Such imagination Rowling has, especially in this fifth novel, a wizard bureaucracy complete with flying memos!  As long as they're reading, let's not lament too much that kids are crazier about Potter than Alice.  Let's just give thanks that they're reading.

      My mother-in-law insisted that I write about  urlLink this .  Being a good son-in-law, I'm more than happy to comply.  Let's pretend that President Bush is coming to Salisbury.  ("Why's he coming to a reliable red state like North Carolina?"  you wonder.  I don't know.  Maybe to raise money.  Maybe to shore up the re-election hopes of poor old Robin Hayes, whose vote for "free trade" preceded the liquidation of his district's biggest employer, Pillowtex.  But we digress.)  Anyway, the President's motorcade is going to move down highway 29, past the shuttered North Carolina Finishing Company, past the forelorn Cone Mills plant on South Main Street, down to Kannapolis where the bohemoth Pillowtex complex stands idle, to a rally for Robin Hayes.  This is a big deal--the President of the United States driving through Salisbury.  Where do you go to catch a glimpse of the motorcade?  Do you stand on North Main Street in front of the courthouse, or South Main Street, alongside Chesnut Hills Cemetary?  It depends on what you think about the administration.  If you think it's great that the President has invaded and conquered Iraq, and you want to give him the thumbs up, then anywhere along Main Street is fine.    But suppose you disagree with the administration's policies.  Suppose you think that a progressive tax code is the best means of promoting economic growth and social stability.  You're rankled that the President has eliminated the estate tax and slashed dividend taxes.  Suppose further, that you want to raise a placard that says "Tax Wealth, Not Work" high enough for the President to see as he speeds by.  It'll have to be a pretty tall placard, because you'll have to stand in what the Secret Service has deemed a "free speech zone."  In this case, it's the practice field at Catawba College, two miles from the motorcade route.  My scenario is not far-fetched, as you'll see if you click on the link above.  Whenever the President hits the road, his handlers sweep the way clean of protestors.  One guy in South Carolina snuck in the designed Groupie Section close to the President, and raised a sign that said "No War for Oil."  When asked to leave he refused.  Now he's facing federal charges.  I don't know why my mother-in-law is outraged.  I'm pretty numb to this sort of thing.  Before they took office they sued to prevent an accurate vote count from happening in Florida.  The rammed the so-called Patriot Act through a frightened, gutless Congress, eroding all kinds of civil liberties.  They  urlLink hand over suspected terrorists to third countries  which routinely torture prisoners.  Regarding the 800 languishing at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, they have yet to comply with the Geneva Convention which requires its signatories to convene a tribunal to determine the status of captured soldiers.    This administration has already trampled on so many human rights that nothing surprises me anymore.  Nor does it surprise me that the President doesn't want to listen to dissenting opinions.  As reporter  urlLink Seymour Hersh has shown  , once the administration decided that it wanted to invade Iraq it asked the CIA to forward immediately to the White House any scrap or shred or rumor of intelligence that bolstered the case for war, without sending the intelligence through the usual vetting process.  Stovepiping, they call it.  This is an administration that doesn't want to be bothered by the facts, much less your cranky opinion about this issue or that.  Nancy, you and I would be much happier if we just sat down, shut up, and let these wise people run the country (and the other countries they periodically take over) as they see fit.

      On this day after election day,  urlLink you might want to click here, take this test,  and find out what your political type is.  Rather than locating you on a left-right contiuum, this quiz plots you somewhere on a grid.  The left-right axis measures your economic ideas, and the up-down axis measures your preferred degree of state power (authoritarian versus libertarian).  The inventors of this test say that the old left-right scale is inadequate.  How can you explain the fact that the "far right" Robert Novak and the "far left" Michael Moore both opposed the Iraq War?  Or, who's farther to the left, Gandhi or Stalin?  What's needed is a two-dimensional system of political categories.  I wound up in the lower left quadrant, Liberal Libertarian, somewhere between (ha, ha) Nelson Mandela and Jean Cretien.    Some of the questions are a little tricky, and if you want to take the test, perhaps you shouldn't read my comments.  One was, "The freer the market, the freer the people."  Agree or disagree?  Well, if the choice is between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, I agree.  But if it's between the U.S. and present-day Albania, where there is no state regulation of commerce, no transparancy, no rule of law other than the law of the capitalist jungle, I'd have to disagree.   urlLink My slate took all five seats  on the Salisbury City Council.  I hardly ever vote for the winner in an election.  Just what crazy kind of town do I live in?  Yesterday's vote is a victory for historic preservation, downtown development, good race relations, and an overall sound quailty of life for this community.  I'm pleased.

       urlLink Here's a review  of two new books on Harry Potter, one fer em, and one agin em.  The agin em book,  urlLink "Re-reading Harry Potter," by Suman Gupta , is not a far right screed about occultism.  The reviewer says it's a far left screed about the racist, classist and sexist world J.K. Rowling has created.  I haven't read Gupta's $60 book on Harry Potter, but if the reviewer's analysis is correct, he appears to completely miss the point of Rowling's novels.  Yes, the wizarding world is full of all the same -isms that the real world is, but the books' clear intent is that the reader disapprove of those -isms.  (I will defer for the time being, addressing the issue of whether or not there is any such thing as authorial or narrative intent, an issue which ties literary critics in knots but need not detain people outside the academy who "like to read good books.")   The racist Malfoys, who despise wizards with Muggle ancestry, are the bad guys.  At the beginning of the fifth book we enter the Ministry of Magic to see a statue of house elves and other magical creatures bowing before a proud wizard.  At the end of the book we hear Professor Dumbledore's censure of the elitist ideology implied in that statue.  The reader understands that Dumbledore is a completely reliable source of truth in the narrative.    Contrary to Gupta's assertions, there are strong, resourceful female characters in the series, Hermione and Professor McGonagall, to name two.  Unlike the movie versions of Tolkien's  Rings  trilogy, which magnified the minor character of Arwyn in order (I think) to satisfy modern sensibilities about gender and modern desires to see strong female characters, the film versions of the Potter books had no need to dress up the stories in respectable feminist attire.  The women were already there.  At the same time Rowling lampoons do-gooding liberal paternalism.  Hermione's house elf emacipation efforts get rejected by none other than the house elves.  Rowling seems to imply that people have to want to be liberated before they can be.  Is this too much stress on personal responsibility for the leftist Gupta to stomach?  The reviewer remarks that Gupta pays little attention to what's truly wonderful about the Harry Potter books:  a plot with more twists and turns than the nastiest roller coaster, vivid characters whom we either love or hate, and a narrative world almost as varied as the real one we inhabit.  This is so typical of the far left, which, still following Marx, reduces the meaning of everything to the class struggle, and has a tin ear for aesthetics.    Reading Harry Potter is like entering a Russian Orthodox cathedral.  Reading Gupta's analysis of Harry Potter is like entering a Soviet-era apartment building.

       From today's news...    urlLink Cal Thomas is miffed  because the new CBS mini-series "The Reagans" portrays the Gipper as a gay-basher.  Brother Cal cites a heartfelt sympathy letter the former President wrote in 1988 to a woman whose daughter died after contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion as proof that the movie is off-base.  Never mind that the letter in question concerns a person who came down with AIDS "innocently."  Check out  urlLink Ray Shilts' acclaimed book  on the birth of the AIDS pandemic,  And the Band Played On.   The disease came on the medical radar screen in 1981.  The virus causing AIDS was identified in 1983.  Rock Hudson died in 1985.  By this point AIDS was the nation's number one public health concern, and a major news story.  How many comments had President Reagan made about this major domestic crisis at this point in his administration?  None, Schiltz reports.  Zero.  Zilch.  Nada.  When one considers all the press conferences, all the speeches and all the public appearances Reagan made in those years, the silence is deafening.    There's more.  Reagan's HHS budgets regularly gave short-shrift to AIDS at the time when the disease was first ramping up.  Budgets were so tight at the CDC that scientists couldn't even get new doorknobs, the ones that you push down on rather than turn, so that they could easily carry samples from one room to the next.  Only because Orin Hatch (a true compassionate conservative) gave HHS more money than they asked for did any research and prevention get going in the 80s.  Did Reagan ignore AIDS because he despised gays?  I don't know.  What's your theory?   urlLink Tonya Jameson is right .  One of the best things about the Renaissance Fair is that it makes obesity sexy.  Seriously, who'd you rather have serving you that turkey leg and pint of meade?  Some Gwyneth Paltrow-type, or an Oprah-sized woman bursting at the seams of her barmaid's dress?  In the real Renaissance days, the skinny chicks probably had TB.  So raise a stein to all those wenches in plus size costumes!  At the Ren Fest, thin isn't in!   I knew things were going from bad to worse  in Iraq even before I heard about the helicopter going down.  Driving over to the church I listened to an interview with  New Republic  Editor Lawrence Kaplan on  urlLink NPR's On the Media.   Over 2,000 Americans have been wounded in Iraq, and we're not talking about (egg) shell fragments in the eye, which earned Major Frank Burns his Purple Heart in Korea.  Kaplan, with great difficulty, got into Walter Reed Army Hospital to interview the wounded.  He says the place looks like something out of a Civil War photo.  Rooms, hallways and waiting areas are filled with 19 and 20-year-old men with missing arms, legs and eyes.  Kaplan interviewed one soldier from North Dakoa who was assigned to a patrol boat looking for guerrillas.  Every day his boat came under fire, and finally, they got him.  The media, which the Bush administration blames for presenting an overly pessimistic view of the situation in Iraq, has focused exclusively on soldiers killed in Iraq.  Ironically, this focus makes the situation seem BETTER than it is.  A soldier killed here or there, this day or that, generates an image of episodic, isolated, but occasionally effective resistance against the U.S. occupation.    In fact, U.S. forces are fighting a determined, well-organized insurgency.  Mopping up this is not.  Nor is the violence of the past two weeks mere desperation tactics, as the President characterized it.  They're hurting us.  They've run the U.N. out of town, and they're running the Red Cross out too.  If there's anyone to blame, it's the administration for botching this occupation:  1.Not controlling the looting, which embittered ordinary Iraqis against us, 2.Commiting too few troops to secure the borders and ammunition depots, 3.Utterly failing to win international cooperation to win the war and the peace, 4.I could go on and on...    There's too many people getting shot in Iraq for the administration to go shooting the messenger.

      I joined ESPN's recap of the top 100 sports stories of 2003 somewhere in the 50s.  This crazy dirt bike rider did a 360 in the air before he landed upright.  As usual the commentary was more memorable than the on the field stuff:     If he's in a year-long slump, then the rest of us are in a lifetime slump .  Michael Strahan on Tiger Woods.     He's the Shaquille O'Neal of bicycling .  Shaquille O'Neal on Lance Armstrong.    Sadly, two of the top ten stories were scandals.  Kobe Bryant was number one, but number ten was the far more disturbing (in my opinion) crimes that blew up the Baylor basketball program.  One player, probably severely mentally disturbed, shot and killed a teammate.  But when the ensuing investigation threatened to uncover corruption in the Baylor hoops program, Coach Dave Bliss tried to get his assistants and teammates to blame the bad money floating around on the dead player by falsely accusing him of being a drug dealer.  If I watch college sports and resolve not to buy any of the products that are advertised, am I still part of the problem?     This morning I caught a bit of CNN , and thrown in with all the news about armed guards on selected foreign airline flights into the U.S. was this tidbit:  be on the lookout for people with almanacs.  They're using them to plot terrorist attacks.    I'd be bent over laughing if I weren't dumbfounded, speechless, incredulous, etc., etc.  Almanacs?  You mean the big hardbacks with beautifully detailed maps of  "the Prairie Provinces" or "Central Europe?"  Or are we talking "Poor Richard's?"  Which phase of the moon is ideal for crashing airliners into skyscrapers?  Think I'll go to  urlLink Amazon  and buy a Koran, an Almanac and see how long it takes for Agent Smith to ring my doorbell…     urlLink If I lived in the beautiful South Carolina Lowcountry  I would probably not vote for Howard Dean in the February 3 primary.  But I need to learn to like him, as he is shaping up to be the likely Democratic nominee.  Truthfully, it's not that hard.  Dean is the Newt Gingrich of the Democratic Party.  He shoots his mouth off, simultaneously appalling the establishment, goading the opposition to hatred, and endearing himself to his base.  Newt waxed nostalgic for orphanages.  Dr. Dean doesn't want to prejudge the guilt of Osama bin Laden.  Newt vowed to never compromise with the Democrats.  Deano famously declared that he was representing "the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party."  If Dean wins the nomination, it should be a fun election.  And don't count out the Doctor.  Like his evil twin, Howard Dean is politically skillful.

      When Laura cleans out the refrigerator and serves it up to us in warmed-over oozy lumps, she calls it "Yuck Pot Soup."  Today's serving was quite good. There were some raisins in there with sauteed cucumbers.  This is the blog equivalent of Yuck Pot Soup.  It's hard to get your mind around the disaster that's unfolded in southeastern Iran.  I try to imagine what 25,000 dead people is like.  And all from the same city and region.  I try to imagine what 70% of the buildings in a given city destroyed is like.  What if that happened to Salisbury?    Alas, my imagination fails.  And so I haven't thought about it too much.  The few people killed in that mudslide that destroyed a Greek Orthodox Camp in California has made a much bigger impact on me that the Iranian earthquake.  I think that it was Joseph Stalin, of all people, who said that the death of one person is a tragedy, but the death of a million people is a statistic.  He was right, in a grim and evil way.    More important than how I feel is what I do.  My heart may go out more to the few killed in California than the many in Iran, but my head knows that the greatest need is in Iran, and the Red Cross needs a check from me.  December 28 is the  urlLink Feast of the Holy Innocents  on the Roman Catholic calendar:   When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he was infuriated, and he sent and killed all the children in and around Bethlehem who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had learned from the wise men.  Then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet Jeremiah:  "A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be consoled, because they are no more."  Matthew 2:16-18  Another ruler launches a pre-emptive strike to secure "peae and justice" in the Middle East.  Hmm... sounds familiar.  Some of you Missouri people need to tell me how good Priest Holmes and the Chiefs really are this season.  I remember in the days of Steve Bono a 13-3 Chiefs team played Indianapolis in the playoffs and got sent home for the season.  Are these Chiefs for real?  We never get to see them here in NC.  It's just Panthers, Panthers, Panthers and the AFC East.  We've had great weather lately.  Cold, cold nights and mild, sunny afternoons.  A tad too warm for me.  I like Christmas Day to be brisk but not frigid, but afternoon temperatures have been flirting with 60.  Best of all is the sharp contrast between the green, green grass in the park and the brown trees and sharp black shadows the winter sun casts.  Gotta run create a Saturn V rocket out of Play Dough with my boys...

      The Observer's religion section  urlLink trumpeted the arrival  of yet another "church for the unchurched" in Charlotte.  You know the drill.  "Postmodern" worship, no dress code, skits, PowerPoint, refreshments, blah, blah, blah.  Folks over 40 need not apply.    What would a companion ad look like for a traditional, denominational church in a parallel universe where "church for the unchurched" reigns supreme?  Perhaps this:     The First Church of the Almighty Heavenly Father will meet in a cavernous stone structure on the downtown square.  "Premodern" worship features an examination of ancient texts and participation in esoteric food and drink rituals.  Those with good taste in music (Bach and Handel) and poor taste in coffee (no chicks with square glasses serving that Starbucks swill here, thank you very much) stand a high probability of being moved to write a big fat check to some do-gooding social services agency.     Now if that sounds ridiculous to you, but the Observer article doesn't, then you're a low brow snob just like the rest of the "church for the unchurched" crowd.

      All day I've been thinking about a story from the gospels to which I alluded in my Christmas Eve sermon:     One day he got into a boat with the disciples, and he said to them, "Let us go across to the other side of the lake."  So they put out, and while they were sailing he fell asleep.  A windstorm swept down on the lake, and the boat was filling with water, and they were in danger.  They went to him and woke him up, shouting, "Master, Master, we are perishing!"  And he woke up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; they ceased, and there was a calm.  He said to them, "Where is your faith?"  They were afraid and amazed, and said to one another, "Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?"    (Luke 8:  22-25)    Note that while Jesus solves the problem at hand the disciples remain an emotional basket case.  The storm terrifies them, but the One who can deliver them safe and sound to the other shore terrifies them too.  So why'd they wake him up?  Clearly they didn't expect him to do anything about their predicament, or else they'd be giving him high-fives instead of huddling at the other end of the boat muttering amongst themselves. They thought that they were going to die, and they wanted to sink into the waves accusing the one who'd gotten them into this jam.    So typical.  We'd rather have something to complain about than actually have our problem solved.  For if our cancer were cured, our unhealthy relationships straightened out, our nation at peace with other nations, etc. etc.; then we'd have to deal with a force more powerful than cancer, terrorism or dysfunctional behavior.  They devil you know is always preferable to the devil you don't know, even when that devil is… Jesus.

      There are so many things to be afraid of this Christmas.  We fear for the safety of our friends and loved ones stationed in Iraq.  At home our Terror Alert has jumped up to Code Orange.  Members of our congregation are flying here and there over the holidays while we hear the disturbing news that Al Qaeda maintains an interest in aviation.  And thank goodness the traditional Christmas meal is ham and not steak, or we'd have something else to worry about.  So we come into this house of worship, beautifully adorned for the season, to sing some of our favorite music, and be comforted and reassured that, though the world is menacing, everything's going to be all right.  Except...  there's a fair dose of fear in the Christmas story.  Take the shepherds, humble farm laborers working third shirt, immortalized by countless boys wearing bathrobes in Christmas pageants.  They are terrified by the sight of the angelic hosts of heaven.    And the shepherds are the rule, not the exception.  There are almost as many terrified people in the gospel of Luke as there are in a Stephen King novel.  The gospel begins with the story of the priest Zechariah encountering the angel Gabriel.  Poor old Zechariah is speechless with fright, and he doesn't get his voice back until nine months later when, after his elderly barren wife Elizabeth has miraculously delivered a baby, he names the child John, as per the instructions of the angel.  Luke notes that "fear came over all their neighbors," and what happened to Zechariah and Elizabeth became the talk of the town.  So too Mary was "deeply troubled" when Gabriel announced to her that she would give birth to the Son of God.    Laura and I have been watching the HBO adaptation of Tony Kushner's play  Angels in America .  One of the characters is named Pryor.  He's a gay man with AIDS.  Weird things keep happening to Pryor.  Ghosts visit him at night.  He has visions in the doctor's office.  And then one evening, home in bed, alone because his companion deserted him when he was diagnosed, an angel visits Pryor.  The room heats up like an oven, until the roof cracks open and collapses on Pryor, and down comes an angel, dressed in blinding white garments with wings beating back and forth (whoosh, whoosh) and a voice that sounds like the roar of a furnace.  And the look on Pryor's face is a mixture of awe and flat-out terror, and he begs her to leave.    Angels in America is a controversial play because of the subject matter, but give Tony Kushner credit.  He knows his angels.  They are not at all like the plump, cute, childlike Precious Moments angels you may have seen.  No, angels are God's instruments of shock and awe.  So too is the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.  That cute little baby Jesus grew up to scare the heck out of any number of people.  There's this story about Jesus setting sail with his disciples on the Sea of Galilee.  When a storm threatened to capsize the boat, Jesus ordered the wind and waves to calm down.  The storm ended, and his disciples were no longer afraid of dying.  They were afraid of Jesus.  "Who is this who commands even the wind and water?"  they muttered among themselves.    When Jesus and the twelve got to the other side of the sea they encountered a wretched case:  a demon possessed man who was so wild that he couldn't be restrained even with chains.  He lived in the wilderness howling and bruising himself with stones.  Jesus cast out the demons, and when the residents of that region saw the man clothed and in his right mind, they were seized with great fear, and they pleaded with Jesus to leave them.  So much for gratitude.  We human beings are really messed up.  Not only are we frightened of bad things, war, terrorism, contaminated food, we're even more scared of good things:  a child born to a childless couple, healing, a call to ministry, an angelic choirs.  We are more afraid of God than we are the devil, more afraid of good than evil.  It's entirely appropriate.  "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom," says the Psalmist.  Now we mainline Christians, who take pride in our religion of love, as opposed to the fundamentalist religion of wrath, go to great lengths to say that "fear" isn't really fear, it's a healthy respect, a reverence for the divine.  But I wonder if there's not also a place for good ol' fashioned blubbering, sweaty palmed, stomach churning fright when God encounters us.  Donald McCullough wrote, "We will fear God.  It is natural and unavoidable.  For if God is God, then our efforts to be like God are overcome.  (God's) power uncovers our weakness; (God's) holiness reveals our sinfulness; (God's) love exposes our selfishness; (God's) eternity underscores our mortality.  How can we not be afraid?"    Indeed, Christmas is about the coming of this God into our world and our lives.  This almighty, holy, loving and eternal God has invaded time and space and human history and now confronts us in our weakness, our sinfulness, our hard-heartedness and our decay.  Christmas is a scary thing.    "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom."  But it's not the end or the goal of wisdom.  True, the shepherds quake at the sight, but eventually they pull themselves together, so much so that by the end of the story these lowly ranch hands have sung the first ever Christmas cantata and have gone on the first missionary journey, even if it was confined to the city limits of Bethlehem.  What accounts for their turnaround?    The angel says "Fear not."  True, the God who has drawn near them in heavenly chorus and babe wrapped in swaddling clothes contradicts, judges and condemns all that we are.  That's scary.  But only in order to save us and transform us.  God in Christ has come as Savior.  God has come to deliver us from evil, not only from evil doers in the headlines and in our nightmares, but also from the evil within us.  God in Christ has come as our Lord.  No longer must we serve the cruel overlords of money and power, but we can take on the easy burden of kneeling and worshipping Christ our King.  God became man, said the fourth century theologian Athanatius, that man might become God.  The angel is kind enough to confirm the good news with a sign:  you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.  A strange incubator indeed, even for that technologically challenged time and place.  God ordains the strange circumstances of Jesus' birth in order to confirm that God is going to do what God said God would do.  We need signs because our faith is weak.  The Word alone too easily withers in our hearts before it takes root, and we conclude that the cavalry will never arrive, that God has abandoned us, or even worse, that God is out to get us.  But God gives us signs that confirm Hod's faithfulness and mercy and grace, costly grace.  This table and this sacrament is our babe wrapped in swaddling clothes.  It is a sign that confirms and seals the good news on our hearts.  God has come to punish sin, to right wrongs, and establish justice and righteousness.  And God has come in mercy, to bear the punishment that we deserve, to free us from sin and death.  Eat the bread, drink the fruit of the vine, remember, and believe.  In C.S. Lewis' wonderful story,  The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe , there is this exchange between the children who are lost in the land of Narnia and some friendly animals about the rumored arrival of Aslan (who symbolizes Christ in the story):  "Is (Aslan) a man?"  asked Lucy.  "Aslan a man?"  said Mr. Beaver sternly.  "Certainly not.  I tell you he is king of the wood and the son of the Great Emperor Beyond the Sea.  Aslan is a lion, the great lion." 	 "Ohh," said Susan.  "Is he quite safe?  I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion."  "That you will dear and no mistake," said Mrs. Beaver.  "If there's anyone who can appear before Aslan without their knees knocking, they're either braver than most or just silly."  "Then he isn't safe?"  said Lucy.  "Safe?"  said Mr. Beaver.  "Don't you hear what Mrs. Beaver tells you?  Who said anything about safe?  'Course he's not safe.  But he's good.  He's the King, I tell you."  There's nothing safe about the Incarnation of holy, almighty, loving and eternal God in our sinful, futile, suffering lives.  If the name Emmanuel, which means "God is with us," isn't enough to send a chill down your spine, then you are quite brave or quite silly.  But the God who is with us is a Good God, who has come to pardon us, suffer for us, transform us and set us free.

      OK, I am a little worried.  The "mad cow" was an elderly dairy cow sent to the slaughterhouse after giving it her all.  And while I don't eat beef, my whole family consumes a lot of milk, cheese and ice cream.  Not all the stuff we buy is organic.  Can you get BSE (aka, Mad Cow Disease) from dairy products?  This  urlLink Charlotte Observer article  (registration required)quotes an undersecretary for food safety as saying, "the disease is not known to be transmissible through dairy products."  Let's say that I'm a bit underwhelmed by the level of certitude in that statement.  Politicians and bureaucrats are madly scrambling to contain Mad Cow Disease, or at least look like they're containing it.  Soon the recriminations will begin.  Who's fault is this anyway?  The cattle industry?  Government health and safety inspectors?  Politicians or judges who weaken regulations?  All of the above, but most importantly, it's YOUR fault.  That's right.  YOUR fault that there's beef in the food chain that can turn your brain into a "bowl full of jelly."  All you care about is that there's lots of food and it's all cheap.  That consumer pressure for volume and savings gets translated into all kinds of "innovative" agricultural practices.    Since World War II we've gone from an entirely organic, labor-intensive agriculture to a chemically based, genetically modified, industrialized agribusiness machine.  Huge tractors and combines have replaced mules and plows.  Chemical fertilizers have boosted the yield per acre dramatically.  Herbicides eliminated the need for humans wielding hoes.    Of late, the evolution has accelerated.  Rather than a network of thousands of small farmers supplying us with hogs and chickens, conglomerates like Tyson and Cargill raise tens of thousands of animals on one sight scientifically and efficiently.  Animals get fed antibiotics and high protein supplements from cradle to grave.  The result is that there's more food and cheaper food than ever before.  But there's no free lunch.  The consolidation and efficiency in modern agriculture has ruined rural communities.  There's no jobs anymore down on the farm, and young people are fleeing to cities and suburbs.  The downtown district in the small Missouri town where I used to live is literally falling down.    And there have been devastating environmental side effects from the industrialization of agriculture.  Those cheap, efficient hog factories dump thousands of gallons of effluent into rivers when their waste lagoons leak or rupture (which they do on a regular basis).  Mad Cow Disease is spread from feeding cattle a high protein formula made up of ground up brains and spinal cords of previously infected and slaughtered cattle.    It seems like common sense would tell us that turning the cows we slaughter into cannibals is bad.  It's also common sense that pumping thousands of gallons of hog manure into an unlined lagoon would pollute the water supply, especially in the sandy soil of eastern North Carolina, but we did that too.  The point is, nobody cares until there's a problem.  Nobody cares about where the food comes from, how its grown, whether or not the farmer got a fair price for it, so long as it's cheap and plentiful.  Until there's a problem.  It's time to start caring.  Obviouly there's a role for the government to play in food safety, but the most important role is played by the ones who eat food.  That's all of us.  We can begin by buying more organic foods.  Here, the federal government has helped the consumer by establishing tough standards for what foods can bear the organic label.  Buying organic is more expensive, but the cheaper non-organic foods are cheaper only because they're coming out of process that passes costs along to other locations.    Buying organic is certainly healthier.  As demand for organic foods increases, farmers will respond by putting more organic products on the market, and that added supply and competition will help moderate the cost.    And buying organic may be good for rural communities.  Raising crops with organic methods can be labor-intensive.  If consumers buy more organic foods, that may create more farming jobs in rural communities, and allow some small operators to stay in business rather than selling the farm to a bigger neighbor.  Now go dig in.  Merry Christmas!

       urlLink Text Week  is down this morning.  Probably crashed after desperate preachers everywhere began hitting the site looking for something to say tomorrow night.  Meanwhile I slog through  urlLink Barth on the Incarnation .  I should have done this reading earlier in Advent.  There's nothing much here about shepherds and angels, but a whole lot on the Annunciation and the doctrinal statement, "conceived by the Holy Ghost; born of the Virgin Mary."  Barth asks, Can we in good conscience speak of the Mother of Jesus as the Mother of God ( theotokos  in Greek)?  Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christians certainly do.  Barth says Yes, because the word  theotokos  reminds us that the one born of the Virgin Mary is the same one eternally begotten by the Father.  Unfortunately  theotokos  has been distorted by many accretions to Christian reflection on the Virgin Mary over the centuries.  Mary, it is said, was perpetually a virgin (a view held not only by Catholics but by early Protestants such as Martin Luther and Heinrich Bullinger).  Mary, it is taught, was also conceived without sin so that she could be a pure vessel for gestating the Son of God (the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception).  And Mary, it is added, didn't die.  She was assumed into heaven.  Barth doesn't make the obvious (Protestant) point that these accretions aren't testified to in scripture.  He argues that the Church went wrong on Mary when she became an independent topic of theological investigation, rather than a subordinate topic under Christology (the study of the person and work of Jesus).    What this leads to, says Barth, is an image of Mary as the partner with Christ in God's plan for salvation, and as partner, also necessarily a rival.  And where the Catholic Church has got it wrong about Mary, she has got it wrong about herself, for Mary is an icon of the Roman Catholic Church.  The Church, like Mary, occupies a relatively independent place in the redemptive process.    To all this, says Barth, Evangelicals can only respond with a resounding confession of the sovereignty of Christ who is Lord of Creation.  Faith in Christ has nothing to do with the reciprocity of the human creature toward God's plan of salvation.  True faith begins with renouncing all reciprocity, and acknowledging the shear power and graciousness of God in Christ to save.   Interestingly, the Catholic scholar Lawrence Cunningham makes the same observation about the turn in Mariology in a  urlLink somewhat recent article in Theology Today .  Cunningham, writing a half-century after Barth, also notes that the Second Vatican Council tried to reign in an independently functioning Mariology.  He cites the 1994  Catechism of the Catholic Church  which states, "What the Catholic Church believes about Mary is based on what it believes about Christ, and what it teaches about Mary illumines in turn what it teaches about Christ."  He also notes (approvingly?) that some contemporary Catholic scholars have called for a halt in new pronouncements about Mary until the ecemenical impact of any such announcement can be evaluated.  Nervousness still lingers in the Catholic Church that the last act of a dying Pope may be to declare Mary  co-redemptrix  with Christ.  For me, Mary is more evidence that God chooses "things that are not to bring to nothing the things that are so that no one might boast in the presence of God" (1 Corinthians).  God chooses a barren, elderly couple to be the parents of a chosen people.  God chooses a vigilante to be the great lawgiver.  God chooses the youngest son of Jesse, a poor shepherd, to be king of Israel.  God chooses a persecutor of the church to become the church's most effective evangelist.  And finally, God chooses, who else?  A virgin to give birth to God's son.  What a weird, mischievious God we serve, a God who is always turning things upside down!

      I grew up in Fayetteville, North Carolina, best known for its close proximity to Fort Bragg, home of the 82nd Airborne Division.  Units of the 82nd are seeing a lot of action in Iraq.  They are occupying portions of the so-called Sunni Triangle, a hotbed of anti-American guerrilla activity.  Author Thomas Wolfe, born at the other end of North Carolina, wrote a book titled  You Can't Go Home Again .  That's been my unofficial motto for thinking about my hometown.  I'd long since concluded that my peculiar views on Christian nonviolence would make me unemployable anywhere near the Fayetteville city limits.  But my new  urlLink Christian Century  arrived in the mail today, and I was put to shame.  A little article in their news section detailed the work of Fayetteville's  urlLink Quaker House  .  These pacifist Christians are making an effective witness for peace in one of the more thoroughly militarized regions of the country.  Quaker House affiliates regularly protested against the Iraq War.  At present they assist soldiers who are leaving the army on conscientious objector grounds.  They also offer a listening ear to family and friends who are scared to death about the plight of relatives who've been deployed to Iraq.  It was rough going in March, according to the  Christian Century  article, but as the occupation has soured, Quaker House workers are finding that community support of their mission is rising.  Maybe I can't go home again, but that doesn't mean that the gospel isn't being proclaimed in Fayetteville, NC.  Thank God it doesn't depend on cowardly little me!

      Christian Peacemaker Teams has posted  urlLink an action plan  for American Christians who are concerned about the treatment of Iraqi civilians by U.S. and coalition forces.  In sum, they urge us to read the testimonies of detainees and their families that CPT staff workers in Iraq have recorded, publicize their stories, and contact our congressional delegation about these individuals.  Remember, "Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth, good will toward Men."  Glorifying God certainly entails using our rights as citizens of the United States to lobby on behalf of those who may have been mistreated in the name of "our security."

      Saddam's been in the brig for a week, and the terror alert code just went Up (?) to orange.

      So Wake and Carolina  urlLink play one for the ages , while the Wolfpack turns in an utterly forgettable performance in a 58-55 loss to South Carolina.  Stormin' Norman we need you.  You knew how to  urlLink come out of Columbia with a W .  Liberals and libertarians are like oil and water.  The latter despise the welfate state.  The former think it's essential for social peace and justice.  The latter are pro-Second Amendment.  The former's first love is the First Amendment.  So why is Yours Truly, a bleeding heart if there ever was one, now linking to  urlLink Lew Rockwell ?  Because he stuck up for poor, old bleeding heart conservative urlLink Cardinal Martino .  Libertarians are right about two things.  ONLY two things, but at this time in history they're quite important:  The War and The Patriot Act.    Didya see the end of the Saints-Jaguars game?  Time to get the brown paper bags out again--for that NO kicker.  So what's a spider hole, anyway?  Does it mean that they drug Saddam out of a hole so small only a spider could fit into it?  Is this Special Forces talk?  (If that were the case, I'd expect an acronym, not "spider hole.")  I did  urlLink this search , and learned that "spider hole" has quickly gone from new noun to metaphor to cliche in just seven days, but I didn't learn what the danged thing is.

      This morning's paper led off with the good news that  urlLink Libya has agreed to abandon  its chemical and nuclear weapons programs.  The Libyans initiated this process in March, when the War on Iraq began, prompting the White House to credit its doctrine of pre-emptive war for the Libyan turnaround.  Libya has been trying to change its spots for a while now.  After a decade of sanctions, the Libyans finally turned over the Pan Am 103 bombing suspects in the late 1990s.  I believe that was during the  Clinton  administration.  Yesterday's news is another welcome step in the right direction.  If the war on Iraq hurried them along, then it's fine with me if President Bush wants to take the credit, though anyone with a good memory wouldn't give him all the credit.  And I think that's awfully big of me considering the fact that no Republican I know will give President Clinton credit for anything good that happened while he was in the White House.  And a lot of good things happened in the 1990s.  Lots of jobs.  A surging stock market.  A balanced budget.  Etc, etc.    In fact, I'll give the President all the credit for Libyan disarmament as long as the President's willing to take all the blame for North Korea being a nuclear power today.  Let's shake on it.  Related question:  why is Colonel Gadhafi still only a Colonel?  He's ruled Libya since 1969--that's as long as I've been alive.  Shouldn't he be Marshall Gadhafi by now?  General Gadhafi?  Supreme Commander Gadhafi?

      I have a terrible secret of which I must unburden myself.  You, Dear Reader, may never again darken the virtual door of this weblog after getting a load of this.  Yours truly is on the verge of descending to the ninth level of geekdom hell.  That's right.  I'm thinking about PLAYING D&D.    It's been a long time coming. I was on the debate team in high school.  I've read Tolkien's trilogy twice, and I've picked up The Hobbit for a third time.  I've attended two Ren Fairs now, and I even went to one in costume.    Moreover, I don't keep the kind of company that could be depended upon to maintain the sliver of cool quotient I have left.  My wife watched all three Rings movies back-to-back-to-back this past Tuesday.  She also has some friends who are, O dear, how can I go on?  Well, I must tell all.  She has some friends who are THEATRE PEOPLE.    So now I find myself in possession of the latest edition of the AD&D Player's Manual.  But we need a DM.  That's a "Dungeon Master" for the uninitiated.  D&D, you see, is a role playing game.  You pretend that you're a swashbuckling knight, an elven wizard or whatever, in search of treasure, fame, glory.  The DM is to the game what a director is to the play.  He/she orchestrates the adventure.    I emailed the operator of a message board for role playing game enthusiasts in the Charlotte region.  He said, "Be careful.  Your enjoyment of the game depends entirely on finding the right DM."  Now I'm all nervous about posting an email on the message board requesting a DM.  It's like I'm creating an ad for some dating service:     WM, 34, ISO DM, 28-45, for weekend fantasy.     Hmm.  It needs some work…

      I'm reading  urlLink Volume I.2 . of Karl Barth's  Church Dogmatics  as background for my sermons on Christmas Eve and January 4.  It takes Barth 800 pages to say anything, so I have to slog through a seemingly endless methodological discussion before I get to the shepherds and wise men.  I haven't yet found anything applicable to our candlelight service, but Barth has stimulated in me new interest in evangelism.    The Incarnation is the event in which God reveals himself to us.  For Barth there is no "proving" this event.  One cannot begin with a general idea of "God," a set of convictions about human nature, and then logically argue that something like what the New Testament says happened on Christmas is reasonable.  Nor will it do, says Barth, to begin with certain ideas about the attributes of God, find their purest form in Jesus and say, "Aha!  There is the God-Man!"  The Eternal Word taking human flesh in order to speak God's good news of reconciliation is a self-authenticating event.  There's no way to argue or reason oneself to the truth of that event.  Argument and reason flow from the Incarnation, not toward it.    An obvious complaint about Barth is that he's fideistic.  That is, he uses faith to prove faith claims.  But Barth insists that if we try to argue or reason our way to embracing the Incarnation on some basis other than the incarnation itself, then our theologies are really idolatries.  Only the Incarnation can tell us what God is like.  Barth says that  urlLink this oil painting  by Matthias Grunewald illustrates his theological method.  Note that the face of the Christ child is bathed in the light of the Father.  Both Mary and the angels in the sanctuary to the left fix their gazes on his radiant face.  There's no way to peek behind that curtain to see God directly.  Only by looking at Jesus Christ can we see who God is.    I remember back in college listening to a preacher on NC State's brickyard who was trying to prove the existence of God to a skeptical audience.  "If you see a watch lying on the ground, then you know that somewhere, there's a watchmaker," he said.  "So too, as we look at the world around us.  If there's a creation, then there has to be a Creator."    I imagine that Barth would have no patience with this argument, and not only because it can't withstand the compelling and essentially atheistic account of the natural world posed by evolutionary biology.  If Barth were standing in the brickyard, what would he say?  Perhaps something as simple as quote 2 Corinthians 5:19.  "God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself."  But what of the inevitable retort, "Prove it!"  or even a softer, "Why should I believe you?"  What would Barth say to that?    I haven't read enough Barth to give an informed answer, but my guess is that he would say something like what Philip said to Nathaniel in John 1.  When Philip announced that he'd found in Jesus of Nazareth what all Israel was looking for, and Nathaniel scoffed, asking, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"  Philip replied, "Come and see."    Come and see.  The only "proof" that "God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself" is to follow Christ.  That means attending those events where the Event of the Incarnation is remembered, the proclaiming of God's Word and the sharing in the sacraments.

      I've been meaning to follow up on  urlLink this earlier post  about the authority of scripture, as San Diego Presbyterians understand it.   urlLink Essential Tenets and Reformed Distinctives  makes a very strong claim for the formal authority of scripture, but contains no guidelines about how to interpret scripture.  Specifically, the authors don't mention the "rule of love" that several Reformed confessions stress, ie. Does our interpretation of scripture enhance love of God and neighbor?    This is an important omission because it directly relates to our use of scripture and the homosexuality debate in the  urlLink Presbyterian Church (USA).   Indeed, that debate seems to lurk behind much of the arguments put forth in ETRD.  If one comes to the scriptures with a loathing of homosexual behavior, then it's easy to find confirmation of your views, especially using the methodology of ETRD.  For example, If the scriptures are our supreme authority (as ETRD asserts), and if scripture condemns homosexuality (as I imagine the authors believe it does), then the church has no choice but to condemn homosexuailty, no matter what the psychologists or doctors or our homosexual friends and family members are saying, because, as ETRD asserts, no other human authority can trump scripture.    But the Rule of Love asks about the motivation behind this chain of logic.  Is condemning homosexual behavior an act of love for the homosexual?  Do we really care about these people?  Or do we simply think that boys kissing boys is gross, and Leviticus and Romans gives cover to our prejudices?  The Rule of Love also needs to be remembered as we watch the evening news.  The Islamic nihilism we see at work in Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda organization is Exhibit A for what happens when the reading of sacred texts and the living out of a religious tradition is not tempered by love.  Christians (and Muslims of good will) ought never miss an opportunity to stress the need for love to guide every interpretation of scripture.  An appeal to love is not a fig-leaf for "everything goes."  It is certainly an act of love to encourage a person to break off an adulterous affair.  I do wonder why it is that adulterers as a group are not reviled in the way that homosexuals as a group are reviled.  Certainly the one cheated on may despise his/her unfaithful spouse, but I can't imagine that the random hate crime perpetrated against Matthew Shepard would be perpetrated against a random philanderer.  And since I wonder about that, I wonder about condemning homosexuailty in the name of upholding "the authority of scripture."

      Don't have much to say right now.  After a series of colds, I'm healthy and back to running.  Three miles yesterday, a little bit on the Greenway.  Sunny, cold, bright.  The perfect December day.  Meanwhile, Leonard Pitts wins the "best commentary on Christmas consumerism" award.   urlLink Read all about it here .  I'll write more later.

      A couple noteworthy reactions to the capture of Saddam Hussein:   So another totalitarian bastard-of-a-tyrant was pulled from a hole and will be stuck in a threadbare, dank apartment, and that we can applaud. But what about the tyrants – here at home – that have decapitated American liberty by convincing a populace that we needed to usurp an entire nation that had not ever posed a single threat to our American homeland?   Easy, Gentle Reader.  I know you're outraged that some loony leftist, probably Michael Moore or HOWARD DEAN (note angry tone, use of profanity), established moral equivalency between our God-fearing President and Attorney General and one of Allah's cast-offs.  But before you fire off a letter-to-the-editor, you should know that I found the above quote at the anti-tax, anti-welfare state, rabidly capitalist, extreme right wing web site run by Libertarian  urlLink Lew Rockwell .  Here's another one:   I felt pity to see this man destroyed, (the military) looking at his teeth as if he were a cow. They could have spared us these pictures.   You're bewildered, Gentle Reader.  I know.  Just how can these tree-hugging, vegetarian, parasitic pacifists, living under the umbrella of the U.S. military in comfortable places like Berkeley, California, possibly feel compassion for a war criminal like Saddam?  Is there no end to their pathetically naive view of the world?  Sigh.  Probably not.  But that's beside the point.  The second quote comes from  urlLink Cardinal Renato Martino  of the Roman Catholic Church.  Not quite head of the political science department at Berkeley, but just as liberal, just as relativistic, just as humanistic, right?  My point?  There are a few people out there who are still "conservative" in the true sense of the word.  The hold to old fashioned doctrines like, "We shouldn't start wars," and "Love your enemies."  They are voices crying in the wilderness.  They've been displaced by radicals and imperialists who call themselves "conservatives," or the less disingenuous term "neoconservatives," but they're there, and they're still shooting their mouths off.  May their tribe increase.

      I try to limit my side bar links to those blogs and web sites I actually read.  So I'm switching out  urlLink daily KOS  for  urlLink Talking Points Memo .  Kos is mostly horse race stuff, polls, the chase for campaign dollars, etc.  And Kos is a Dean fan, and like most Dean fans, he's a little thin skinned when it comes to the Doctor, especially when other Democrats are doing the criticizing.  TPM is, in my opinion, a bit less shrill, and better written.  It's less geared toward the horse race, and more geared toward news analysis.  Pen's  urlLink Gutless Pacifist  blog is a great intersection of Christian theology and contemporary issues.  I read him every day.  Pen's a Dookie.  We tries not to holds it against him, my precious (oops, some weird convergence of ACC basketball hatred and the premier of  urlLink The Return of the King  just crept into my head).  Where was I?  Oh, yes.  If Pen and my lectionary study group partners are any indication,  urlLink Stanley Hauerwas  will yet turn the United Methodists into a peace church.  To sum up, if it's on the side bar I read it regularly, and I think that you should too.

      Let's return to a topic I raised last week-- urlLink the essential tenets of the Reformed faith  as expressed in the confessions of the Presbyterian Church.   urlLink San Diego Presbytery  has identified six essentials and seven distinctives that are the essence of our Reformed tradition in a paper titled  urlLink Essential Tenets and Reformed Distinctives .  This post will look at their first essential tenet, the Authority of Scripture.  It's pretty straightforward.  The Bible is God's written Word.  It's the Church's first and last authority.  We are to "love, follow, obey, surrender and submit to God's Word--both Jesus Christ, the living Word of God, and the Scriptures, the written Word."  The first generations of Protestant Reformers sought to elevate the authority of scripture over against the teachings of church councils and authorities.  ETRD would take a stand on scripture alone not so much against fallible and even corrupt ecclesiastical authorities as against secular ideologies.  It denies any doctrine "that attempts to subordinate biblical authority to   any   human authority... whether religious, ecclesiastical, governmental, political, economic, psychological, sociological, scientific, historical, philosophical or other..."  (emphasis mine).  The paper also insists that the facts of Jesus' life death and resurrection are historically true, and that biblical doctrine and ethics cannot be overturned.  The writers of this section are clearly preoccupied with shoring up the left flank of the church.  This treatment of scriptural authority has no patience for a developmental understanding of Christianity that might give permission to alter traditional church teachings in light of "new information" on, say, homosexuality.  They will not concede one iota to the modern world view that only what is observable, repeatable and verifiable can be "true."  I wonder if this bulwark against liberalism might not be a confessional Maginot Line.  In other words, is there a right flank that defenders of the Reformed faith might also want to defend?  The  urlLink Confession of 1967  states that while the Bible is the Word of God, it is "nevertheless the words of men, conditioned by the language, thought forms and literary fashions of the places and times in which they were written...  The church, therefore, has an obligation to approach the Scriptures with literary and historical understanding."   urlLink The Study Catechism  (not a confessional document, but a good reflection on current, mainstream Presbyterian thought) offers this question and answer:  "Doesn't modern critical scholarship undermine your belief that Holy Scripture is a form of God's Word? No.  The methods of modern scholarship are a good servant but a bad master.  They are neither to be accepted nor rejected uncritically.  Properly used they can help us rightly and richly interpret scripture; improperly used they can usurp the place of faith.  Wise interpreters use these methods in the service of faithful witness and understanding.  The methods of modern scholarship remain a useful tool, while Holy Scripture remains reliable in all essential matters of faith and practice."  ETRD might have been stronger on this tenet had they acknowledged that historical and literary criticism can help us understand God's Word without reducing the Bible to "mere history" or "a good read."  As I said last week, the fundamentalists are long gone from the PC(USA), but it would be good to remind ourselves that mainline Presbyterians don't read the Bible with their heads stuck in the sand.  Jesus Christ, ETRD will remind us later, is fully human and fully God.  If that's the ontology of the Living Word, might we not say the same thing about the Written Word, that the Bible is fully human and fully God?  Perhaps this Christological formula is behind C-67's statement that the Bible is the Word of God and "the words of men."  Sociology, psychology and history aren't the final authority for Reformed Christians, but they can help us explore the "true humanity" of holy scripture.

      Dennis Quaid is on  urlLink the cover of today's Parade  section.  The quote "I now take life as it comes" runs underneath his photo.  This is so typical.  Every week Parade offers us an article about an older, wiser celebrity (or youngish, wiser celebrity), the title of said article being the celebrity's hackneyed words of wisdom or self-discovery.  "I cherish what's really important" a grinning Billy Bob Thornton might affirm.  Or how about Justin Timberlake paired with the words, "Success hasn't changed me."  When are we going to see some actor or musician who hasn't learned a thing on the cover of Parade? Why not an article about some star who hasn't gotten his act together yet?  Can't we have an interview with some famous person who hasn't yet mastered psychobabble? Let us see a  urlLink mug shot of Nick Nolte  and the caption, "My life is spinning out of control."  Or a glum hair band musician confessing, "My career is in the toilet."  Come on, Parade. Surprise us!

      Saddam Hussein emerged from his hole  urlLink looking a lot  like an alcoholic veteran who visited us regularly when Laura and I lived in the manse next to the church.  "Well, he has been homeless since March," my wife reminded me.  True.  This morning's worship was our annual service of lessons and carols.  The  urlLink reading from Isaiah  lept out at me:   Of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end .  "His" being the Messiah, Jesus.  I'm not in favor of theocracy, either the Taliban flavor, or the "good ol' days" flavor when churches in America were full.  Christendom, those in the know call it.  Isaiah's words are being fulfilled in the evangelization of the world, as those who confess Jesus Christ to be their Lord and Savior "increase."  We live as  urlLink resident aliens , under the authority of temporal governments, yet always remembering that "our citizenship is in heaven."  Our ultimate loyalty is to Christ.  Nonetheless, the relative justice and peace that secular governments impose is of concern to Christians.  "Seek the welfare of the city that the Lord is sending you," the prophet Jeremiah charged his fellow Jews as the Babylonians marched them off into exile.  We don't demand that the state use force to impose the gospel of love on its citizens, but just as yeast causes bread to rise, Christian communities can have a leavening effect on the wider society.  As Afghans meet this weekend to establish a new constitution, and as the capture of Saddam Hussein closes forever an ugly chapter in the history of Iraq, how can those of us whose ultimate loyalty is Jesus Christ cause justice and righteousness to spring up in those two countries?

      Wow.  I'm listening to the radio reporting the capture of Saddam Hussein.  And the Google ad at the top of my blog says something like "click here to find out how to make a ton of money in Iraq."  Coincidence?  The deaths of Saddam's sons did not lesson the violence in Iraq.  Perhaps the capture of Saddam himself will be different.  I certainly hope so, not only for the sake of American soldiers who are in harm's way, but for the sake of the people of Iraq who have suffered for so long.

      We finally saw Reloaded last night.  Does anyone in the Blogosphere think that Zion looks an awful lot like Isengard after Saruman wrecked the place?  I can't blame that bald guy in the first movie for wanting to forget everything.  Nope.  Can't blame him at all.  Is that the Shroud of Turin on the  urlLink Bell South home page ?  No, it's the Lord Aragorn.  That got me thinking.  There are actually two Messiah figures in  The Lord of the Rings .  Frodo is the suffering servant, the one who bears a terrible burden to free the world.  Aragorn is the eschatological Christ who "comes in glory to judge the quick and the dead, and of his kingdom there will be no end."   urlLink Ralph Wood's The Gospel According to Tolkien  is on my to-read list.  I wonder if he explores Messianism in the Rings trilogy.  The  Christian Century  ran an excerpt of the book in a recent issue.  There Wood notes that Tolkien's work diverges from the Norse and Greek myths that inspired him in his treatment of pity.  For the ancients, pity was bestowed only on worthless, pathetic creatures.  To show pity to an enemy was considered perverse.    Yet Tolkien's characters repeatedly pity their enemies.  "Pity stayed Bilbo's hand," to quote Gandalf, when he had a chance to kill Gollum with the Ring of Power.  Frodo too shows mercy to Gollum, despite the latter's treachery and all around loathsomeness.  Only because the dangerous Gollum is pitied does the epic not end in disaster.  That pity, not courage or brutality or fate, drives the Rings trilogy distinguishes Tolkien from the bards of old as a Christian writer.  In a world of "No Fear" bumper stickers, governed by leaders who promise to "rid the world of evildoers," is there any room for pity?  If not, shall our epic end in anything other than disaster?  No.  There may yet be much suffering, but I believe that our epic is in the hands of one who pities his enemies.  It's not in the hands of the evildoers, or the ones who would rid the world of them.

      I was raking up pine straw in the yard yesterday when the UPS truck stopped.  I had to sign for a thin package addressed to my wife.  Hoo-boy!  My Christmas present!  I thought.  Even better.  Laura entered a Kelloggs sweepstakes a few weeks ago.  The letter in the package informed us that we have won a trip to a really big American city and a fistful of frequent flyer miles.  And they aren't even U.S. Airways miles!  BUT... they want us to fill out all these forms, get them notarized, and return them pronto.  Is this legit?  We have to scrutinize the fine print.  I've actually won a couple of things in my life.  In college I called into a morning radio show,  urlLink WRDU  I think, answered two out of three questions correctly, and won two tickets to a Doobie Brothers concert.  Laura heard me on the radio.  We weren't dating at the time, and sad to say, my radio trivia prowess did nothing to raise her interest in me beyond the dreaded "good friend" level.  I had to work the night of the concert, so I gave the tickets to the RA downstairs, Kinlaw.  Man, I haven't thought of him in a long time.  My most vivid memory of Kinlaw is him staggering into my dorm room one night drunk out of his mind.   The traffic gate that used to be affixed to the security guard post outside  urlLink Syme Dorm  was under his arm.  It seems that the arm had called Kinlaw an obscenity, and he wasn't going to take it lying down.  Later I won two tickets to the Columbia, Missouri Symphony Orchestra.  I had hurt my back, and was in bed when the radio said, Be the third caller, and I was!  (You don't often hear that kind of thing on a classical music station--except during their pledge drive--but  urlLink KBIA  is different, I guess).  This time Laura was my date, and she was my wife to boot!  Guess I need to start listening to the radio more...

      Yesterday morning they said that France and Germany couldn't win contracts to rebuild Iraq.  Yesterday afternoon they're on the phone with the Presidents of France and Germany, asking them to forgive Iraq's debt.  These people never cease to amaze me.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm one of those "forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors" people.  They should forgive Iraq's debts.  It should be all about the well being of the long suffering Iraqi people, not about political revenge.  AND, if their companies can do the best work for the best price, they should get a slice of the rebuilding pie.  Again, it should be all about the well being of the long suffering Iraqi people, not about political revenge.  Now that Gore's endorsed Dean, there's much angst among the Beltway punditry about who can stop Howard Dean.  Because somebody needs to stop him, right?  Because Dean's got as much chance of  urlLink winning the South as that other New England Democrat  who ran for President against George Bush.  Sigh.  When incumbents run for re-election, the election is a referrendum on the incumbent.  It's never about the challenger.  (According to my brother, anyway).    This incumbent has two problems at the moment, Iraq and the economy.  If he can solve both of those problems, he'll probably win, no matter who's running against him.  If people at home are still jobless next fall, and soldiers in Iraq are still dying, the Bush will probably lose, no matter which Donkey runs against him.  If he splits, then the race is a toss-up.  Of course something else could happen, another major terrorist attack, a scandal that the press would actually pay attention to (unlike Harkin Oil, Cheney's cronies profiteering in Iraq, etc., etc.)  My brother and I are agreed that all that's left for Dean to do is pick a running mate.  I suggested to John that the Doctor crash a Wesley Clark rally and ask him to be his Veep right there on the stage.  John, a Republican, liked the idea.  It would interject a little WWF attitude into the Democratic race, he said.  Surely that would help Dean down here in Nuture Boy land.

      We had a good laugh at Bible Study Monday night.  We were working on Genesis 42-44, where Joseph is toying with his brothers who've come to Egypt to buy grain during a famine.  (They don't recognize their long lost brother, now the Prime Minister, but Joseph knows who they are, and hasn't forgotten how cruel they were to him).  Anyway, when Joseph's brothers returned to Egypt a second time, Joseph summoned them to his house.  The brothers fear the worst.  One of us read from the  urlLink Revised Standard Version :   And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house, and they said, "It is because of the money, which was replaced in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us to make slaves of us and seize our asses.   Other translations read "donkeys" rather than "asses," but I think the RSV is to be prepered in this case, as it adds a sense of urgency to the whole situation.  :)

      How could I have let yesterday pass without acknowledging the passing of one of the all-time great college basketball coaches, Norm Sloan?  Stormin' Norman probably coached the best basketball player in ACC history.  Yes, David Thompson was superior to Michael Jordan as a COLLEGE athlete.  Sloan probably coached the best ACC basketball teams ever, the '73 and '74 Wolfpack.  Sloan was the winning coach in the best ACC basketball game ever, State's victory over Maryland in the '74 ACC Champoinship game.  And Sloan's victory over Bill Walton, John Wooden and the rest of UCLA in route to a national champoinship ended the longest streak of national titles in college basketball history.  We had a Sunday morning tradition in my family.  We woke up, ate breakfast, and watched the Norm Sloan Show, hosted by Nick Pond and later by... Oh, what's that guy's name?  He was the sports reporter for Channel 11.  Then we'd go to church.    When Stormin' Norman bolted for the University of Florida, and Jim Valvano replaced him, my mother never failed to comment on how the new coach wasn't as well dressed as the old coach.  Jimmy V wore a sweatsuit on the coach's show.  Sloan always showed up in a sportcoat and dress slacks.  True, the sportcoat was a red, plaid thing, but Mom approved, and that's what's important.  Do the clothes make the man?  The casually dressed Jimmy V coached the Wolfpack to a national championship, just as Stormin' Norman did.  And Jimmy V, like his predesessor, also managed to get State put on probation.  I'd have to say the answer is No.  The clothes do not make the man.  I would be remiss, and John Hinkle would fire off an angry email at me, if I didn't mention that Stormin' Norman got his start at  urlLink Presbyterian College .  To hear Hinkle tell it, Sloan would pull out of Clinton SC every June with a trunk full of cash, and return with an empty trunk and a back seat full of Blue Hose basketball players.    Ah, those were the days.  Stormin' Norman in his red plaid sportscoat, Lefty Drisell breaking foot kicking a chair, and State winning championships every now and again.  Now it's the gum smacking mediocrity of Herb Sendek.  To Herb's credit, he hasn't gotten us put on probation.  Hmm.  Maybe there's more than a coincidence there...

      Warning.  This is a long post on Reformed theology and Presbyterian ordination standards...  When Presbyterian elders are ordained, they must affirm that they "receive the essential tenets of the Reformed faith as expressed in the confessions of our church as authentic and reliable expositions of what scripture leads us to believe and do."  So every year when I lead officer training I do a session on the  urlLink Book of Confessions .  With the exception of the  urlLink Apostles' Creed , a fixture in our Sunday morning worship service, elders-elect are usually unfamiliar with this collection of ancient and modern theological affirmations.    Unfamiliar and uncomfortable.  "Just how much of this do we have to sign off on?" a wary elder-elect once asked me as we began delving into the confessions.    It's not just a question for elders and sessions.  Presbyterian ministers must make the same affirmation about the confessions that elders do.  I co-chair our presbytery's Committee on Preparation for Ministry (CPM).  When seminary students move through the preparation for ministry process, they have to demonstrate a personal faith that is shaped by the Reformed tradition.  Our CPM has no formal criteria for determining if an applicant is "sufficiently Reformed" in his/her theological outlook.  Sometimes I think that what Potter Stewart said about pornography could just as easily be applied to our evaluation process:  Reformed?  I can't define it, but I know it when I see it.  Another way of putting it is to ask, Just what are the "essential tenets" of the Reformed confessions that candidates and elders-elect must affirm in their ordination vows?  If one could identify them, and ask folks where they line up regarding them, all parties might be clearer about just what it is that people are "signing off on" when they make their ordination vows, and whether or not they can "sign off" in good conscience.  That said, the larger church has been reluctant to pin things down.  " urlLink The Confessional Nature of the Church " (hereafter, TCNC), a study paper approved by the 198th General Assembly (1986), notes that Presbyterians have repeatedly rejected attempts to make a precise enumeration of essential tenets, apart from a brief list of general theological affirmations in chapter two of the Form of Government.  That list mentions some Reformed watchwords:  sovereignty, covenant, stewardship, etc.  (I imagine that when our CPM sees or hears these words in a candidate's faith statement, our "inner gatekeeper" breathes a sigh of relief).    TCNC casts this reluctance in a positive light.  It prevents the confessions from being interpreted in a legalistic manner.  It encourages the very study of the confessions that is presumed by the ordination vow to be "continually guided" by our confessions.  Now  urlLink San Diego Presbytery  has rushed in where the denomination has feared to tread.  In June the presbytery approved a document titled  urlLink Essential Tenets and Reformed Distinctives  (hereafter, ETRD) for use by its CPM and Committee on Ministry as they evaluate candidates for ordination and ministers transferring into the presbytery.  The document "distills the 300 pages of the Book of Confessions to a helpful summary"--six essential tenets and seven points of theological distinctiveness.  The presbytery also commends the paper to the denomination for study and for training newly elected elders.  Fools they are not, however.  ETRD argues persuasively that a Potter Stewart approach to examining people up for ordination may leave CPMs and sessions feeling like they have no choice but to pass along folks they're uneasy about because they lack specific criteria on which to base a "No" response.  Written 15 years after TCNC, you get the feeling that ETRD is less worried about a legalism that imprisons church officers in a doctrinal straight jacket, and more worried that the boundaries of the Reformed tradition have been stretched beyond the breaking point.  Presbyterians are trying to play baseball without foul lines, and the game is not going well.  With this document San Diego Presbyterians have gotten out the chalk, and are declaring what's fair and what's foul.   	 To this extent, I believe that the authors of ETRD are on target.  The fundamentalists are long gone from the PC(USA).  But a vague humanitarianism that pooh-poohs doctrine and claims that "all you need is love" is alive and well.  Though it is vital to "love thy neighbor as thyself," Jesus teaches us that the greatest commandment is to "love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength" (emphasis mine).  Doing theolog (literally, "God-talk") well is an end unto itself.  Also, our  urlLink Book of Order  asserts that "truth is in order to goodness."  In order to love one's neighbor well, it is necessary to think about and glorify the God who created, redeemed and sustains our neighbor.  ETRD admits that it's a working document, subject to change.  It denies that candidates have to subscribe to specific language set forth in the document.  It welcomes persons who can express core convictions in fresh language.  It claims to be a conversation starter and a tool for use by sessions, CPMs and COMs.  So long as San Diego Presbytery takes these qualifiers seriously as they use ETRD, there will be little danger that this approach to evaluating candidates will degenerate into a new, stifling scholasticism.  Having said that, there's much in the report that I take issue with (and much I concur with).  Over the next few days I'm going to comment on what ETRD identifies as the core elements of Reformed theology and their treatment of these various topics.  If you're interested, stay tuned.

      So this morning my brother and I are chatting about  urlLink farm subsidies, corn syrup,  and making other sounds of brotherly affection when the subject changed to Al Gore's endorsement of Howard Dean.  "Why'd he endorse Dean?"  John asked me.  "Probably because Dean rips George W. Bush like no one else in the race," I replied.  Fast forward to a few minutes ago.  The  urlLink NPR commentator asked some talking head  what, if anything, Gore and Dean have in common with each other.  Nothing, he answered, except a visceral dislike for the President.  So when is Chris Matthews going to start calling me for my expert analysis about Campaign '04?  I'm unavailable for the Sunday morning talk shows, of course, but I have both the time and the "wisdom" to enhance any week night cable shootout at the punditry corral.  Then again, maybe I'm not a genius.  If the armchair pundits like myself are coming up with the same analysis as the so-called experts who are handicapping political races for Big Media, then maybe that says more about their level of genius than mine.

      No reply so far from Christian Peacemaker Teams about what folks like you and me can do to advocate for  urlLink these Iraqi civilians  treated harshly by U.S. soldiers.  Maybe there's nothing we can do, or maybe the CPT email checker doesn't check email as religiously as I do.    Meanwhile, you ought to read  urlLink this New York Times article  on how the American counter-insurgency has stolen a page from the Israeli Army playbook.  U.S. soldiers have surrounded one Iraqi town with razor wire, forcing everyone to enter and leave the town through one U.S. manned checkpoint.  Residents have to produce IDs at the checkpoint, printed in ENGLISH.  Do these tactics work?  Since the U.S. stepped up its response to the rebellion, the average number of attacks per day have been cut in half.  On the other hand, the government whose occupation we're imitating has been in the West Bank and Gaza for 36 years, and has yet found the will or a graceful way to exit.   urlLink The Chief of Staff of the Israeli Army  recently commented on their operations in the Occupied Territories, saying, "In our tactical decisions, we are operating contrary to our strategic interests."  Does razor wire strung around Iraqi hamlets beget a peaceful and democratic Iraq?  Ask an Israeli in the know.  Remember again, Gentle Reader, back to January and February.  You were told Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, in violation of U.N. resolutions.  (Where are they?)  You were told that Iraqis would welcome us as liberators.  (Some welcome!)  You were told that Iraqi oil would pay the costs of reconstruction.  (Read the fine print:  Iraqi oil plus $87 billion of your taxes).  You were told that our troops would not be there very long after we declared victory.  (Korea, 50 years and counting.  Germany, 58 years and counting.  Israel in the Occupied Territories, 36 years and counting).    Tell me again why you're even thinking about re-electing this crew?

      I heard second hand that Ethan asked some hard questions in Sunday School.  Here's one:  If Jesus was God's Son why did he let him die on the cross?    Ethan's not the first to discern some tension between our image of God as Love and Jesus atoning for the sins of the world by being crucified.  In the last decade or so some feminist theologians have charged that such a teaching makes God the Father a divine child abuser.  They also allege that this glorification of divine violence in pulpits and classrooms underwrites a culture of violence:  wars, wife battering, etc.  The essay "For God So Loved the World?" in the book  urlLink Christianity, Patriarchy and Abuse   is a good example of this line of thinking.  The feminist critique merits a couple of responses.  One, it's not an original critique.  The doctrine of "satisfaction atonement," ie. God laid the punishment for our sins on the crucified Christ, was first taught by a medieval theologian named Anselm.  Anselm's contemporary, Abelard (of Heloise and Abelard fame) thought that it was absurd to suggest that a loving God would demand the sacrifice of God's only son.  Abelard saw the cross as the finest example of the depths of divine love.  Jesus' words, "Greater love hath no man than this--that he lay down his life for his friends," were Abelard's inspiration.  That leads to response number two:  There are various ways of understanding the significance of Jesus for us today.  In addition to Anselm and Abelard's interpretations of the cross, we should mention that the early Christians emphasized the resurrection as the primary atoning event.  On Easter, Jesus broke the powers of sin and death after an unjust and painful death.  His victory becomes ours when we receive him in faith.  Eastern Orthodox Christians stress the saving event of Christmas more so than Good Friday or Easter.  "God became man that man might become God," said the fourth century theologian Athanatius, the watchwords of many a contemporary Orthodox priest and theologian.  Satisfaction atonement is not equal to Christianity.  If there are problems with this theory of the atonement, that doesn't mean that Christianity as a whole is inherently abusive.  The problems with Satisfaction Atonement can be resolved, I believe, by remembering that God is a Holy Trinity who encompasses the life of Jesus.  Jesus is not just some chump God throws to the wolves.  Jesus is "God with Us."  God doesn't make a scapegoat of Jesus so much as God in Christ chooses to absorb the punishment that we rightly deserve.    I'll allow that careless preaching and teaching on the atonement may give the false impression that God makes a scapegoat of Jesus, but it's this strawman that the feminist critique demolishes, not a thoroughly Trinitarian doctrine of Satisfaction Atonement.  The latter is Good News indeed:  God found a way to punish sin without destroying the sinner in the process.  But how to answer Ethan's question?  I think stressing Jesus' closeness to God would be a good place to start.  What Jesus says, does and experiences God says, does and experiences.  The fact that Jesus died for our sins doesn't mean that God was indifferent to Jesus' fate.  It means that God knows our sufferings and has triumphed over them.  It means that God has done for us what we couldn't do for ourselves--reconcile us to God.  (He also asked a lot of other questions about Mary and Joseph's trip to Bethlehem, namely, how did they get there without cars; where did they eat; and how long did it take.  When the lesson ended in a group prayer, Ethan thanked God for cars and restaurants.)

      From the "Careful with that or you'll put your eye out" department, did you happen to see  urlLink Brittney Spears on the cover of Rolling Stone ?  Man, I'm so out of it.  Last I heard Brittney was a virgin tease.  When did she become a porn queen?  The cover reminds me of an old Bruce Springsteen song:   Well I came home from work and I switched on channel 5 There was a pretty little girly looking straight into my eyes I watched her wiggle back and forth across the screen She didn't get me excited  She just made me feel mean  You can look look but you better not touch boy...

      For many people, late November through early January is family reunion time.  Perhaps that's what you cherish the most about the holidays--seeing long lost loved ones.  On the other hand, maybe there's a reason why it takes an airplane flight just for you to extend season's greetings to your relatives in person.  If you're in the latter batch, then let me share with you what I discovered the other night when a nasty cough kept me awake.  I pulled C.S. Lewis'  urlLink The Screwtape Letters  off the shelf to wile away the time until the NyQuil kicked in.  Here, Screwtape, a seasoned demon, is giving Wormwood, a junior demon, advice on how to lure people away from God:   In civilised life domestic hatred usually expresses itself by saying things which would appear quite harmless on paper... but in such a voice... that they are not far short of a blow to the face.  To keep this game up you and Glubose    (your fellow demon)   must see to it that each of these two fools has a sort of double standard.  Your patient must demand that all his own utterances are to be taken at their face value and judged simply on the actual words, while at the same time judging all his mother's utterances with the fullest and most over-sensitive interpretation of the tone and context and the suspected intention.  She must be encouraged to do the same for him.  Hence from every quarrel they can both go away convinced, or very nearly convinced, that they are quite innocent.  You know the kind of thing:  "I simply ask her what time dinner will be and she flies into a temper."   Heh, heh, heh.  Y'all try not to cut each other up while carving the Christmas ham.

      Two problems with the scenario outlined in my previous post:  1.  True, Bush is stimulating the economy, but in the wrong way.   urlLink Robert Rubin told NPR's Marketplace  today that Bush could have achieved the same stimulus effect without the long term debt hangover by enacting different tax cuts, temporary tax cuts that would benefit low and middle income persons.  Ah, Robert Rubin.  The sound of his name is music to our ears.  Quick:  name one Bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with Rubin's gravitas.  Still thinking?  It'll come to you...  2.  We can't give the Republicans control only in wartime because they've ingeniously concocted an endless, global "war on terrorism."  There will be no V-J Day in this war; hence no date to show them the door.  How conveeeeenient, we says.

      This PM  urlLink NPR  reported that government spending under the Bush administration is up 16% per year, twice as much as during the Clinton administration.  Add to that spending the huge tax cuts that Congress passed and Bush signed, and what you have is a phenomenal amount of stimulus being applied to the economy.    It's working.  GDP was up by some crazy figure in the 3rd quarter.  8%, I think.  The stock market is rising, forecasting future economic growth.  Which goes to show (once again) that John Maynard Keynes knew what he was talking about when he said that government intervention could jump start a slack economy.  In theory, conservatives hate Keynes, but in practice they're more Keynesian than any Democrat.  Reagan did the same thing in '81 and '82 with a huge stimulus plan for an economy in much deeper straights than today's--massive tax cuts coupled with huge increases in military (government) spending.  What next?  All the Democratic presidential candidates are planning to repeal some or all of the Bush tax cuts.  Which is exactly what Keynesian economics dictates.  In '05 and '06 when the economy is overheating, a tax increase will prevent inflation, and keep interest rates low by lowering reducing government borrowing (to say nothing about reducing the debt we're passing on to our kids).  Exactly what happened in the 90s.    So we need to elect Democrats next year.  (To Congress as well.  Somebody's got to rewrite that wacky Medicare bill.)  We need Democrats in charge for another reason.  The Iraqi mess shows just how incompetent Republicans are at "nation building."  Remember Bush's contempt for the phrase in 2000?  They're much better at nation destroying.    Democrats, on the other hand, following in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson and Wesley Clark, are enthusiastic about nation-building and are pretty good at it.  Remind me again, how many coalition troops died in Kosovo?  So my proposal is that we amend the Constitution to elect Republicans during those four horsemen moments, and we hand the reigns to the Democrats during times of peace and prosperity.  Everyone will excel at "doing what comes naturally," and the nation will hum along for who knows how long...  ; )

      You wouldn't think somebody in their 20s would have enough material to write a spiritual autobiography, but Winner surprises us.  She was raised by a lapsed Baptist mother and an unobservant Jewish father.  Mysteriously, when Mom and Dad got divorced, Mom saw to it that Winner attended the local synagogue.  Winner converted to Orthodox Judaism ("convert" is the proper term; since Winner lacks a Jewish mother, she was not technically a Jew), but a weird dream and intellectual dissatisfaction pushed her into Christianity.  Now she's an Episcopalian.   urlLink As the previous post stated , Winner is a bookish sort of person, so it's not unsurprising that she landed in the Anglican fold, where  urlLink The Book of Common Prayer  defines Sunday worship and everyday spirituailty.  Winner appreciates the Anglican tendency to put scripture on a par with Church Tradition.  This way of exegeting texts, she claims, more closely resembles Jewish modes of reading the Hebrew Bible than other brands of Protestantism which aver "scripture alone."   Sola scriptura  Jews are heretics; authentic Jewish interpretation of the Bible relies on the commentaries of the Talmudic rabbis.  The relationship between Judaism and Christianity is the central theme of the book, and Winner's life, it would appear.  The author cherishes her Jewish heritage, laments what she's lost in her conversion (relationships, for one), and is also crazy in love with Jesus.  These two quotes illustrate the ridge on which her faith journey has run:   The Passover seder gives thanks to God for delivering us from bondage, but it is also shot through with longing... I think about my family and the Farmers and Randi... celebrating this holiday of liberation, and I want them to realize that Jesus celebrated this same memorial of our redemption from Egypt, and then he died to liberate them eternally.  People think that Judaism and Christianity are radically different from one another... one religion has a messiah who has come, and the other religion doesn't.  But on Ascension Day, I am struck by the deep similarity that lies just underneath the surface.  Both Jews and Christians live in a world that is not redeemed, and both of us await ultimate redemption.   The latter quote was in the back of my mind as I wrote  urlLink Sunday's sermon on Jeremiah 33 .  Winner writes a self-depreciating autobiography.  She admits that she's not faithful at prayer.  She confesses that she's a lousy evangelist.  Rather than eagerly testifying to Jews about Jesus, Winner dreads running into old friends from her Orthodox days and them finding out she's a Christian.  We also find out about her tatoos, unshaven legs and occasional sexual immorality.  But there's a little dirt in  urlLink Augustine's Confessions  too, so let's not hold that against the book.  There's not much in  urlLink Girl Meets God  about social justice or ministries of compassion.  There is, however, a ton about scripture, worship, the Lord's Supper, prayer, confession and personal holiness.  I wonder if Winner had gone from Reformed Judaism to a branch of the Reformed tradition in Christianity, the balance would have shifted in the other direction.

      I finished  urlLink Lauren Winner's  spiritual autobiography,  urlLink Girl Meets God , over Thanksgiving.  Winner leads a life that I admit to envying a whole lot.  She's a PhD student.  She's split the past few years of her life between Columbia and Oxford.  She has no need of wallpapering her apartment because there are bookcases everywhere.  Some people give up chocolate for Lent.  Winner tried, and failed, to give up reading.  Winner has erudite friends with whom she can discuss classical music, theater and of course, the latest and the most ancient theological works.  There is a part of me that would love to bury myself in books and surface only to carry on an "important theological conversation."  But when you have two small children, there's no time or money for PhD work and/or long hours with your nose in a book.  Come to find out at the end of  Girl Meets God  that Winner is jealous of me!  Not of me, of course, but of her friends whose lifestyle more closely resembles my own, a married couple who find out that they're going to have a baby.  Winner wonders if she, the perpetual student who dates here and there, will ever "grow up" and know the joys and struggles of marriage and parenthood.  More about the content of this delightful book later.  For now I'll just shrug my shoulders and say, The grass really is greener on the other side of the fence.

      The Promise Keeper Year C, Advent 1/November 30, 2003 Jeremiah 33: 14-16  I know what I'm supposed to say about the Old Testament reading from the prophet Jeremiah.  This is the first Sunday in Advent.  We watch and wait in Advent for the coming of the Messiah, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  Jeremiah speaks of a "righteous Branch springing forth from David," a King to rule with justice and righteousness.  We Christians confess that God has given Jesus the throne of his ancestor David, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.  He is the just King prophesied by Jeremiah.  Promise made through the mouth of the prophet; promise kept through the person and work of Jesus Christ.  I could end my sermon there.  But I can't, because there are nagging questions in the back of my mind about this neat scheme of interpretation.  Andrew Ettin, the rabbi next door, placed one of those questions in my mind a year ago.  We were part of a panel discussion at the Food Lion headquarters about different religions.  I represented Christianity; he represented Judaism, and there was a Muslim cleric there to represent Islam.  One person in the audience asked, "Why don't Muslims and Jews believe that Jesus is the Messiah?"  Andrew answered, "Messiah is a political term.  The Messiah is a descendant of King David who will re-establish the Davidic monarchy over the territory in the Middle East that we know as Israel.  Jesus didn't do that, so he can't be the Messiah."  He has a point, I have to admit.  Jeremiah's prophecy is a very concrete, this-worldly utterance.  It's concerned with the fortunes of a political dynasty in Israel, the House of David.  It's concerned about the well-being of a specific piece of real estate, the city Jerusalem, nestled atop Mount Zion in the land of Judah, and the long lost northern tribes of Israel, who generations before staged a revolted against the House of David and were eventually conquered and exiled by the Assyrians.  It's concerned about the right ordering of the political, economic and social realm in Israel--that's what justice and righteousness means.  No more robbery.  No more exploitation of the most vulnerable groups in society, the widows, the orphans, aliens living within the bounds of Israel.  Andrew, and Jews in general, have a point because, in fact, none of these things have come to pass in a straightforward sense.  Jerusalem, both in Jesus' day and in ours, is not a terribly secure city.  Whether it's the Romans burning the Temple to the ground or suicide bombers blowing up cafes and buses, Mt. Zion remains a dangerous place to live.    Is there justice and righteousness in the land of Israel?  There is, among both Jews and Palestinians, a remarkable lack of respect for the rights of the alien.  Indeed, who the aliens are in that part of the world is greatly disputed.  Is it the Palestinians who lived there after the Jews were dispersed from the Promised Land in the first century, or the Jews who only lately have returned to the Middle East after living in Europe for two thousand years?  Some on each side want to oppress the alien other.  Hamas and Islamic Jihad want to drive the Jews into the sea, while cabinet ministers in Ariel Sharon's Israeli government now talk openly of "transferring" the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to other Arab countries.  "Transferring" is a clean euphemism for exile, banishment, ethnic cleansing.    And what of the political fortunes of the House of David?  In the modern state of Israel, the Jews have once again experienced political independence, but only a madman would confuse Ariel Sharon with the Messiah.  Christians boldly confess that the Messiah has come, and yet history seems to grind on in its wearisome path toward self-destruction.  The violence and injustice in the Middle East repeats itself in other parts of the world.  In our more cynical moments, even we Americans, proud of our democracy, wonder if our elected leaders rule in justice and righteousness or, like the wicked kings of Israel, put their own self-aggrandizement ahead of the welfare of the governed, to say nothing of the welfare of the poor.  Jeremiah longed to see the reunification of Israel and Judah, and today North and South Koreans long to see the peaceful reunification of their country, and live in dread of the alternative.  How could the Messiah have come and all the prophecies be fulfilled when the facts on the ground speak otherwise?  The Good News that God has raised Jesus from the dead is a bold "Nevertheless" in the face of so much bad news.  True, the Middle East peace process seems hopeless.  North Korea probably has the Bomb.  Politicians serve lobbyists and not the people who elected them.  "Nevertheless," Jesus is alive.  God has raised him from the dead, and so we heap upon him every praise and every honorific title we can come up with:  Messiah, Son of God, Bright Morning Star, King of Kings and Lord of Lords.  Paul describes the resurrection of Jesus as the first fruits gathered in harvest season.  I used this example a few weeks ago in a sermon on the resurrection, but it bears repeating:  Remember how happy you were in July when you found that first tomato on the vine turning just a little bit orange and yellow?  The rest of them were green as a Christmas tree, but that one tomato was a sign that in a couple of weeks your countertop would be covered with the freshest, tastiest vegetables of the summer.  	  The world does grind on its weary way.  Like a heat wave in summer, the violence and injustice seems unrelenting.  But there are signs of relief.  We have heard a rumor of resurrection, and we dare to believe it.  We eat this bread and drink this cup, and we come face to face with the one who was dead but lives forever.  We proclaim his death until he comes, until the harvest comes in in full, until there is justice and righteousness and peace on Mt. Zion and over all the earth, until God keeps the promise that God made in the mouth of the prophet Jeremiah.  That's right... until God keeps that promise.  We do well not to make these prophecies come true prematurely by spiritualizing them, turning Jerusalem into the Church and saying that Jesus the Messiah now reigns in our hearts.  He does rule in our hearts, but that's not what Jeremiah's talking about.  We do well to honor the concrete, every day concerns of the prophet Jeremiah, bread for the poor, justice for the alien and the widow, peace and security for the city of Jerusalem.  After all, if there could ever be justice and righteousness and peace in Jerusalem, it could happen anywhere.  We do well to remember the reservations of our Jewish brothers and sisters.  There are some Messianic prophecies that have yet to be fulfilled, and Jeremiah 33:14-16 is one of them.   	 And that's what Advent is all about.  Advent isn't really about the first coming of Jesus; in Advent we look for the second coming of Jesus.  In Advent we acknowledge that the Messiah's work is incomplete.  Jesus has broken the power of sin and death by atoning for our crimes on the cross and emerging victorious from the grave.  He has flung open the doors of the household of God to welcome gentiles as well as Jews.  Yet the world remains unredeemed.  Evil, knowing its time is short, pours out wrath on the earth in a last gasp effort to hold on.  Jews and Christians are by no means the same.  We worship in separate communities--except for Thanksgiving.  We read the same prophecies very differently.  We have different hymns, different holidays and a different history.  Yet Jews and Christians have one thing in common:  Together we await the coming of the Messiah.  We Christians believe that he has come and gone and will come again; they believe that he has yet to come.  But we both wait for the Messiah, and we hope for justice and righteousness to spring forth from Jerusalem to the ends of the earth. 	 As we look to the future in hope in Advent, let us look to the future as we eat the meal set before us on this table.  Usually the emphasis of this meal is on the past.  "Do this in remembrance of me" says the inscription on the communion table.    But let us not forget Paul's words about the Lord's Supper.  "As often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes."  In a world where might makes right, we eat this bread and drink this cup and hope and pray that the suffering love poured out for us here might eventually carry the day.  On this first Sunday in Advent, November 30, 2003, this meal is nothing more and nothing less than an urgent prayer to God:  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.  O Lord, maker of promises to David, Jerusalem, Israel and all the earth, keep the promises you have made.

      Look Mike; someone's  urlLink getting on Justice Scalia's case !  Not that it'll make much difference.  Scalia seems determined to weigh in on the fate of duck-hunting buddy Dick Cheney.  And I'm still waiting for a principled Republican to demand an investigation.  Tick tock.  Tick tock...  This isn't the first time that Scalia has undermined his credibility.  He shot his mouth off about "one nation under God," and wound up having to recuse himself from the Pledge of Allegiance case from the ninth curcuit.  The Pledge case is one of those rare instances where I'd welcome Scalia's vote.  Someone needs to ride herd on the looniest PC people in the society.  If Scalia had exercised some self-control, he could have written the majority opinion himself.   Everyone's excited  about a Kerry/Edwards ticket, 'cept me.  Kerry/Dean makes a lot more sense to me.  Democrats lost the last election because they didn't defend their left flank (the Nader insurgency, remember?)  Dean is not really a leftist; the NRA raves about his pro-gun governorship, but his stalwart opposition to the war has galvanized the left.  Putting him on the ticket will keep liberals in the fold and energetically working for a Democratic victory in November.  Sure there's no geographical balance in a Kerry/Dean ticket, but there was no geographical balance in the Bush/Cheney ticket, or the Clinton/Gore ticket.  Geography's overrated, but even if it's not, I'm confident that  urlLink Dean can help the Democrats carry Dixie .

      Where are my manners?  Congratulations to Bud, John and all free citizens of Tarheel Nation on Carolina's victory over State Wednesday night.  State's 20 turnovers were nearly equaled by Carolina's 18; hence a close yet bad game, even by radio standards.  Perhaps the Wolfpack will win by one in Mediocrity Bowl II at the RBC Center in February.    Once again, there's only one good team in the ACC.  What am I going to do with myself after the Superbowl?

      Last night Laura and I spent some time with "the general American public," to quote our 19-year-old next-door neighbor.  We watched reality TV--that show about the chick who's faking an engagement to an oaf.  If she can fool her family into thinking the marriage is legit she wins a million bucks.  But what she doesn't know is that the oaf is a actor determined to make her squirm.  I digress.  The plot is immaterial.  What struck me is that we're at a weird point in history in terms of what counts for good looks.  If reality TV is any indication (and ALL these girls on ALL these shows look exactly alike) then being beautiful in turn-of-the-century America means having orange skin, porcelain teeth, ultra-straight hair, bulbous lips, swollen breasts, a tiny wasteline and a huge rear end.  These girls don't seem like the kind of people who hang out in comic book stores, but they've got the cyborg-goddess look down pat.  I think it's strange...

      From the  urlLink Post article  on David Kay's revelations:  White House officials and British Foreign Minister Jack Straw said yesterday that they never claimed that Hussein represented an "imminent" threat.   "I think some in the media have chosen to use the word 'imminent,' " White House press secretary Scott McClellan said. "Those were not words we used. We used 'grave and gathering threat.' "   OK, if we have to debate sematics, "bring it on":  "This is about imminent threat."  - White House spokesman Scott McClellan, 2/10/03   Iraq is "a serious threat to our country, to our friends and to our allies."  - Vice President Dick Cheney, 1/31/03   "Iraq poses a serious and mounting threat to our country. His regime has the design for a nuclear weapon, was working on several different methods of enriching uranium, and recently was discovered seeking significant quantities of uranium from Africa."  - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, 1/29/03   "The Iraqi regime is a threat to any American. They not only have weapons of mass destruction, they used weapons of mass destruction...That's why I say Iraq is a threat, a real threat."  - President Bush, 1/3/03   "There are many dangers in the world, the threat from Iraq stands alone because it gathers the most serious dangers of our age in one place. Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists."  - President Bush, 10/7/02   "The Iraqi regime is a threat of unique urgency."  - President Bush, 10/2/02   "There's a grave threat in Iraq. There just is."  - President Bush, 10/2/02   "This man poses a much graver threat than anybody could have possibly imagined."  - President Bush, 9/26/02  I could go on and on and on.   urlLink Atrios does .  Pretty soon they'll be wanting to debate what the meaning of the word "is" is.  And far be it from me to beat a dead horse, but remember Dear Reader, NOBODY GOT KILLED WHEN BILL CLINTON PARSED VERBS.

      I've announced the collapse of the administration's rationale for war on Iraq so many times that I've lost count.  But just when it appears as though the rubble couldn't slide any further down the hill, along comes David Kay to pulverize it even more.    You know who Kay is--the man Bush appointed to search for WMDs in Iraq.  Last week he quit his post, and  urlLink stated flatly  that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction prior to the outbreak of hostilities.  Why not?  U.N inspections and the Iraqis' own choice to comply with U.N. resolutions destroyed most WMDs in the 1990s.  Whatever WMD capacity the regime of Saddam Hussein retained by the late 1990s was destroyed in  urlLink a U.S. bombing campaign in December, 1998 .  Did you get that?  It was the U.N. and BILL CLINTON who neutralized the Iraqi threat.  Ha, ha, ha...  Why were prewar assertions about Saddam's WMD threat so wrong?  Here's where Kay's testimony muddies that waters.   urlLink The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace  and numerous  urlLink press investigations  have charged that the Bush administration cherry-picked the most damning intelligence data to build a case for war against Iraq.  Kay says that the White House did not manipulate the intelligence data; the CIA failed the White House.  And on the other side of the Atlantic, an inquiry into whether or not Tony Blair's government "sexed up" spy data on Iraq has exonerated the government and excoriated the BBC for making false accusations.  So what gives?  One thing's for sure:  the rationale for war has been unmasked (yet again) as utterly bogus.  It is maddening that President Bush  urlLink stands by  the assertion he made before the war that Iraq was a "grave and gathering danger" in the face of so many facts to the contrary.  It's also entirely unsurprising but just as maddening that the administration and Republicans in Congress resist calls for a full independent investigation into intelligence failures surrounding Iraq.  Such an investigation could settle the question of whether the White House or the CIA is to blame.  Muddy though the waters may be, what ought to be crystal clear to Christians is how dangerous a doctrine Preemptive War is.  Christian thinking on what counts as a "just war" has always included the criterion that war be the "last resort."  To wage a "preemptive war" that is also a "last resort" would seem to be a contradiction in terms.  At a minimum it would demand perfect intelligence and a Solomonic-like wisdom in forming policy based on that intelligence.  We may be lacking in one or both departments.

      I had my semi-annual dental checkup this morning.  Dr. Patel gave my choppers a clean bill of health.  And last night Laura and I watched " urlLink The Secret Lives of Dentists ."  On the whole, I enjoyed sitting in the dentist's chair more than sitting on my sofa watching that movie.  Campbell Scott (David) and Hope Davis (Dana) play a married couple who practice dentistry together.  They have it all--the business, the three great kids (even the youngest who won't stop hitting people), the house, but of course something's amiss.  David is emotionally cut off from his wife, although he's a loving and fairly competent father.  It starts to become apparent that Dana is having an affair.  Painfully apparent, but David won't confront her, because if he does, then there will be a divorce, right?  At times I wondered if the wife and the toddler who smacked everybody weren't both trying to figure out just how much they'd have to act out before ol' Dr. David noticed.  Meanwhile Denis Leary plays (who else?) a real jerk who gets some dental work done at their practice.  He then morphs into David's alter ego, taking up residence in David's unconscious, urging him to get out of this dreadful marriage.  Sort of like Brad Pitt's character in  urlLink Fight Club , although Fight Club is a  very  different film.  The climax of the movie is a bout of intestinal flu that leaves all five family members throwing up on each other, and resolves once and for all whether the marriage will survive.  I know, I know, you can't wait to run out and rent it.  I wouldn't say I enjoyed The Secret Lives of Dentists.  But I did find it interesting in the way that a CPE small group becomes "interesting" when someone presents a verbatim encounter of an extremely dysfunctional family.

      William Safire was a speech writer for President Nixon.  Long ago he mastered the art of fearmongering, guilt by association, rhetorical barbs and the ad hominem attack.  But  urlLink his latest column about John Kerry and John Edwards  is unusually hysterical, even by Safire's poisoned pen standards.  Proclaiming Kerry the second coming of Ted Kennedy is entirely predictable, but John Edwards as the new Huey Long?  Add to that a generous sprinkling of phrases such as "class warfare" and "soak the rich populism," and what you get is pure right wing boilerplate.    I'm surprised to see it so early in the campaign.  If the right wing punditocracy is already foaming at the mouth, then that means they're worried.    They ought to be.  Edwards threatens to steal some of Bush's most reliable voters:  rural whites.  He says that as President he'll tax "wealth and not work."  He points out the simple truth:  if you've inherited your money and live off investments, then Bush's tax cuts on estates and dividends have done you much good.  But if you've inherited nothing and live off a paycheck, then Bush's tax cuts have not, for the most part,  trickled down  to you (oops, sorry about that, but after Safire's barbs I couldn't resist).    Edwards has cleverly redefined the terms of the class warfare debate.  It's not he who has declared war on the rich; it's Bush who's declared war on working Americans by shifting the tax burden away from investments and toward ordinary income and dividends.  That'll play well in the rust belt and the lint belt.    Bush's sycophants in the press appear determined to keep the campaign debate at the soundbyte level.  I don't blame them, because if the debate "descended" into the realm of substantive policy proposals, then Bush wouldn't stand a chance.

      I'd better post something before the power goes out...  The President's Mars initiative--I haven't weighed in on that yet.  The cartoonists have had  urlLink a field day  with it.  It's so expensive, and it's such a transparently political proposal.  But...  The manned space program is in disarray.  "We need a shuttle to build a space station," they said.  And why to we need a space station?  "To give the shuttle something to do."  Beautiful.  The Columbia disaster has forced the government to get off the Merry Go Round.  To the extent that the President is getting NASA out of the shuttle/space station self-perpetuation business, he deserves credit.  But remember who'd be in charge of this project:  the same people who said that they could build a space station for $8 billion.  We're going on $40 billion, I think, and what do we have to show for it?  And how many NASA people have lost their jobs after the Columbia inquiry torched the agency's culture of silence?  Not a one, as far as I know, but click on the comment link if I need correcting.  Heads need to roll in this profligate, cavalier federal agency.  The new administrators need to be men and women who know space and know how to change the culture of a bureaucracy.  Then we can ask about the goals and objectives of manned space travel.   I walked to Food Lion  to get, what else?  Milk and (not bread).  Oatmeal and semi-sweet chocolate morsels instead.  The snow has infected Laura with the baking bug.  While I was gone Laura saw a fox sparrow in the back yard.  I saw a fool in a Camaro doing donuts in the icy Food Lion parking lot.   Pat Featherston wins  the "I'm an Ant not a Grasshopper Award" for going ahead and making a reservation at the Holiday Inn before the freezing rain hits.    Last of all:   "Mr. Frodo!  All this could have been avoided if only we had  urlLink stopped and asked for directions !"

      Who are the Carolina Panthers?   urlLink The hometown newspaper  says that their newfound success is O-so-sweet given the many misfortunes that they have endured.  But  urlLink this Slate article  pretends to know nothing about them except their many misfortunes.  Josh Levin spills more ink about jailed ex-Panther Rae Carruth and deceased ex-Panther Fred Lane than Steve Smith, who torched the St. Louis seconday, and DeShaun "I will not be denied!" Foster, guys who'll actually suit up and play in Houston.  As hatchet jobs go, it's pretty good, but if you want to know "Who Are the Carolina Panthers?" (the title of Levin's article) then look elsewhere.  I'm not too upset.  So what if Mr. Levin trashes the Panthers?  The point is, he's trashing my team, not someone else's, because my team's in the Superbowl and somebody else's isn't.  Nah nah nah nah nah!   It's hard to believe that we're in a winter wonderland  after yesterday's balmy weather.  When I left the homeless shelter at 11:00 PM Saturday, I didn't need the sweater I was wearing.  Speaking of the shelter, I forgot that I was signed up to volunteer.  Rebecca Edwards called me, panicky and a little put out, at 7:30 PM.  "Marvin!  Aren't you supposed to be here right now?!"  I skedaddled it over there, did laundry and left when the night shift arrived.  I regret being late, but had I remembered, I would have been a little resentful all day that I had to cut my day off short to go volunteer at the homeless shelter.  As it was, I enjoyed my Saturday, and still got over there to fulfill my duty, albeit late.  I need to work on my attitude.  On a day like today, I ought to be thankful that I spend time at homeless shelters out of choice, not necessity.    Or do I?  Tell me, Dear Reader, is it enough to do a good deed, or do you have to have a good attitude about it as well?  The "God loves a cheerful giver" thing.   urlLink Sarah    and Greg  will come over tonight.  Greg will play chess with me, and Sarah will watch The Golden Globes with Laura.  Uh, I mean Greg will beat me into submission.  He's a very good chess player.  I'll find out his exact ranking and tell you after tonight.  A couple of weeks ago he taught us how to play.  Laura and I have been playing chess most nights since then.  Doing stupid stuff like moving into check.  It was Laura's idea to have the neighbors over.  During commercials she plans to watch me and Greg play.  I said, "He ought to play you instead of me, since you've beaten me more than I've beaten you."  But Laura will have nothing to do with it.  So I get humiliated, while Laura gets to study and improve.  This is fair.

      Here's a story about how hard it is for the government to save money.  I was talking to a woman who works for one of our state departments of social services.  Her agency is way over-budget this year.  They aren't being wasteful.  The courts keep assigning them children, far more than they budgeted for, and what are you going to do--say No thank you?  She's frustrated because every expense she submits is being questioned.  She's not used to that.  "And to top it all off; Medicaid is no longer covering circumcisions, and I am just not going to let these little boys come into the world without being circumcised!"  she declared.  I tried not to take this personally since neither of our boys are circumcised.  I asked, "What's wrong with that?"  thinking, "Why should Medicaid pay for elective surgery?"  "These boys are being born to 15 and 16-year-old girls who don't know how to care for these children. I've got one boy that we've spent $5,000 on treating urinary tract infections."  Oh.  When you put it that way, $250 for a circumcision is a good value.  So, not ponying up for a little snip-snip in the hospital doesn't necessarily translate into snip-snipping away at the state Medicaid budget.  In fact, it works the other way.  Penny wise and pound foolish, if you ask me.  A post script on the cost of circumcision.  Our two boys were born in different hospitals in different states, yet both hospitals billed us for circumcisions that our children did not receive.  I know that most boys in the United States are circumcised, maybe 70%, but that still leaves a whole lot of boys who don't have this procedure performed.  If our experience is indicative, the hospitals are racking up a lot of money for services they aren't providing.  Where's the money going?

      I'll be gone today and tomorrow.  I'm attending a retreat for the "ministry cluster" of Salem Presbytery--the three committees who oversee ministers and their relationships to congregations.  My committee, Preparation for Ministry, oversees seminary students.  The Examinations Committee examines candidates on their theological views before they are called to serve a congregation.  The Committee on Ministry approves salaries, engages in conflict resolution between pastors and congregations, and supports search committees who are looking for a new pastor for their congregation.  Use the comment link to tell me what you think are the ideal virtues a minister should possess:  intelligence, empathy, a lively prayer life, hair like Jim Bakker, etc.

      Did you hear/see Howard Dean's Smackdown moment after the Iowa caucuses?  I heard it on the radio.  NPR was playing snippets of the top three candidates, and I was halfway paying attention.  Then came this gutteral screaming, and I glanced at the radio.  "That was Howard Dean?"  I wondered.    People are talking about it.  A short article in today's paper quoted an Iowa political scientist who labeled it "weird."  Stewart Rothenberg compared Dean to the head-spinning girl in The Exorcist.  My sister says she saw the video, and he threw his coat off before he roared.  Seriously, I think that this is worth 5-7% in the New Hampshire primary.  It's as if Dean tried to confirm every stereotype the public has about him by going tomatohead up there.  He really IS mean, people are thinking.  Senator Edmund Muskie's bid for the White House ended when it appeared as though he was crying while taking questions from reporters about his wife's mental illness.  Muskie, I think, always insisted that he wasn't crying; the snow was getting in his eyes.  Dean's pump up the volume performance may well have ended his bid for the same reason; voters don't like to see emotional instability in their Chief Executive, even in this post-I feel your pain era.  But hey, when God closes one door; he opens another.  Dean may yet have a vibrant future in the WWF.

      I've gotten past my irritation at The Da Vinci Code.  The new irritant is the Atkins Diet.  I couldn't get away from it over the weekend.  TGI Fridays and Subway now boast Atkins friendly dishes.  Michelob is touting a low carb beer  (pointless, if you ask me, like smoking a "low tar" cigarette).    Unlike every other doctor, who urges you to limit your fat intact, Dr. Atkins insists that you eat lots of protein and fat, and limit your intake of carbohydrates.  If I understand the diet correctly, this is supposed to induce some kind of metabolic fit in your body that burns the blubber in a big way.  It's easy to see why the diet is so popular.  O to live in a world where the biggest problem with the Big Mac is the bun and not the patty!  But, Dear Reader, wishing it don't make it so.  Hence both Atkins and the Da Vinci Code get on my same last nerve.  I can't stand it when so-called experts make money hand over fist telling people lies they want to hear.  (I guess we could lump the Bush administration in there too!)  There may be some benefits to the Atkins diet.  To the extent that it reduces the amount of sugared colas people drink, it's a good thing.  If it reduces your overall caloric intake, then that's probably beneficial.  BUT, there's no getting around the incontrovertible evidence that a high-fat, high-protein diet is a perfect recipe for heart disease and colon cancer.  If you're losing weight on Atkins now, just wait till they have to blast your large intestine with radiation.  Then watch the pounds come off!  Dear Reader, I know you want a quick fix to that expanding waistline, but there ain't no such thing.  Eat what your grandma told you.  Plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables.  Get off your duff and plant a few of those vegetables this spring, and hoe around them this summer.  Slice that tomato, stick it between a big, thick slice of whole wheat bread, eat up and then go for a run, or a brisk walk, or hop on your bike.  Diet & exercise.  Diet & exercise.  Diet & exercise.  Your colon and your capillaries will thank you for it.  And be patient.  You aren't going to go down a dress size overnight.  And be realistic.  You aren't 21 anymore.  And you'll never look it again, Atkins or Marvin plan.

      In the CD player:   urlLink Cats , The Best of  urlLink Culture Club  and  urlLink Buckwheat Zydeco .  No really.  I'm feeling a little campy.  Surprising since I'm so psyched about the football game.  I borrowed the Culture Club from Phil Paschall, who probably has the best classical and R&B collection in Salisbury.  Surprisingly, Boy George's band stands the test of time.  He's got some soul in his voice; hence his inclusion in Phil's comprehensive CD collection.  And the music is a clever mix of pop, R&B and world sounds.  It's not just some guy with big hair presiding over a synthesizer like every other British invasion band.    The journey through Shelob's lair was definitely the nadir of Tolkien's epic for me.  In real life I detest walking through spider webs.  Just imagine being wrapped in one from head to foot with a stinking, drooling arachnid pawing at you.  So when I finally saw The Return of the King last night I was most pleased that the movie Shelob was even more repulsive than the one my own imagination had dreamed up.  I was genuinely frightened when she appeared out of nowhere as Frodo looked up the trail to the orc fortress.  Just ask my wife, who was seated next to me. I was squirming all over the place.    Denethor, I believe, is the Richard Perle of Middle Earth.  It's easy to say,  urlLink Attack, Attack, Attack  when you're stuffing your face in the heart of the capital.

       urlLink Seth  and I watched the State-Duke game last night.  Neither of us expected the Pack to prevail.  Duke had won 34 straight at home.  State hasn't won in Durham since Coach K had that back problem in the mid-90s.    Still, the Wolfpack and the Devils split during the regular season last year.  In the rubber match, Duke came from 14 down to steal the ACC championship from State in the last couple of minutes.  Neither team is all that different from their '03 starting lineups.  An expectation that this would be a competitive game would be in order.    Not!  After an 11-11 tie Duke ripped the Pack.  State couldn't buy a basket, and they were getting plenty of open looks.  I understand that some nights teams go cold, but what was really disappointing was the play of Julius Hodge.  When State got down, Julius tried to take over the game.  Alas, one on five ball doesn't usually go well for the team of one.  Starting from near the half court line, Julius would drive this way and that, never look to pass, and wind up missing a shot, turning the ball over, or getting called for a charge.    I question the coaching here.  If your star player is out of control, why don't you sit him down and say, "Look.  Either penetrate and dish off, or get open and shoot, but realize that this isn't the NBA; you aren't Michael Jordan, and we're down ten; we aren't trying to ice the game."  But I've been questioning the coaching for a couple of years now.    Seth pointed out an irony.  We'll probably beat Clemson this weekend, and with a 3-1 record in the ACC, we'll be sitting pretty.  But only because we haven't played Maryland, Wake or Carolina yet.  It's shaping up to be business as usual:  the bottom feeding Wolfpack wins enough to earn a middling seed in the ACC tournament, and an early exit from postseason play.  Yawn.

      I have nursed a hatred of the Philadelphia Eagles for 20 years now.  Nothing against the players; it's the fans I can't stand.  These are people who cheered (CHEERED, mind you) when Michael Irvin got carried out of the Vet in a neck brace following a career ending neck injury.  I admit that Michael Irvin is not a likable character, and I'm a Dallas fan, but this is how the City of Brotherly Love reacts when they see a man nearly turned into a vegetable?    However… my hatred is mingled with oh-so-sweet satisfaction.  Iggles fans are grumpy because they're frustrated.  Those clenched fists may conceal batteries waiting to be flung at the opposing team, but there are no rings on those fingers anywhere in the stadium.  No rings, baby!  Each of the last two years the Iggles have had a chance to go to the Superbowl.  And each of the last two years they've come up short.  I expect that come Monday the Boo Birds in Philly will be in their usual ill humor due to a third consecutive case of  Superbowlus interuptus .    That said, Don Hudson  urlLink makes a compelling (and perhaps the only) case  for adopting the Iggles should they prevail over the Panthers:  Philadelphia in the Superbowl makes Rush look even stupider than he's made himself look.

      I've been feeling ill at ease the last twenty-four hours.  Kristina Mack,  urlLink the woman found murdered in her Salisbury apartment earlier this week , was a teacher's assistant in Ethan's classroom.  Miss Mack was a tutor assigned to one of Ethan's classmates.  She was a cheerful and pleasant woman with whom I'd exchange small talk when dropping Ethan off or picking him up.  "He had a good day," she'd say to me with a slight smile and sideways glance when I arrived at the school in the afternoon.  That someone would stab this woman repeatedly and leave her for dead is mindboggling.  I feel sorry for her parents who are coming from Florence, South Carolina to take her home and bury her.  I am saddened that her death has the sort of sensationalist details that has earned it wall to wall coverage by local TV news outlets.  People like Miss Mack never garner the media's attention unless they happen to die in a tragic or violent way.  And I am angry that tomorrow Ethan and his classmates will learn something about this world that I'd just as soon they not learn at age five.  Not only has the perpetrator murdered a woman, torn apart the lives of her family and friends, but he has also cast a shadow in the lives of little ones who are entitled to cloudless days.

      I can't let go of this  urlLink Da Vinci Code  thing.  Regarding which books made the final cut for inclusion in New Testament, Justo Gonzalez in  urlLink A History of Christian Thought , writes:  While to us... the fixing of a canon appears as an act of closure, in fact at the time they were acts to open up the tradition.  While many of the heretics claimed the authority of a particular apostle from which they said they had received a secret tradition... the church at large insisted on the open tradition of  all  the apostles, known to  all  their successors, and based on a variety of witnesses--the gospels--which, though not always in total agreement, did agree on the basic issues at stake.  On the other hand, it is true that the process of defining authority also led to the growing disenfanchisement of some--in particular, women.  (see E. Pagels " urlLink The Gnostic Gospels ,"  pp.28-69)  The formation of a canon was not a gender neutral process, but that's a long, long way from saying that the bishops fixed the canon in order to smack down poor old Mary Magdalene.  The bishops did want to smack down the heretics who taught that the God who created this world was an evil God, and Jesus came to impart esoteric knowledge that could free our souls from the prison of the flesh.    The next time you're enjoying a tasty dinner, or making love, or gazing at a beautiful sunset, remember that it's the bad guys in The Da Vinci Code who insisted that Genesis 1 was sacred scripture, that Jesus came "in the flesh," and creation and matter is good.

      After my wife finishes  urlLink The Da Vinci Code  I think I'll be the last person in my congregation who hasn't read it.  I'm told that it's a must read because "it's a great thriller," but when my wife asks me, "Is it really true that before Constantine Christians thought of Jesus as merely a great prophet but not God?"  let's just say that my enthusiasm wanes.  It may be a heck of a page turner, but I don't think that I could ever get beyond the fact that it's clearly a hatchet job on historic Christianity in general and the Roman Catholic Church in particular.  They ought to have called it " urlLink Left Behind  for Liberals."   urlLink Telford Work , theologian and blogger, says it much better than I can in  urlLink this entry from last fall :  On my way to school today I met a new neighbor. (Being a good Republican, I walk to work.) When she found out I teach theology, she asked, "So what do you think of The Da Vinci Code? I hear it's factual."  Well, here is what I think:  1. Why are people suddenly talking about this book? I mean, I had never heard of it until two weeks ago. Since then three different people have asked me what I think of it.  So I looked it up on amazon.com and found out – this on five minutes' "research," okay? – that it is a thriller that presumes a gigantic conspiracy of some sort or other involving the Holy Grail and Jesus getting married to Mary Magdalene and secret organizations in a Catholic Church bent on keeping it all under wraps.  2. So it sounds like a hoot – not just because well written convoluted mysteries are often a hoot, but also because it is more evidence that our culture still finds Catholic conspiracy theories plausible enough to turn into realist fiction.  That says a lot more about the post-Christian west than about both history and Catholicism.  3. I am encouraged that people have found some way to respond to my profession besides changing the subject, but more than a little discouraged that this is the best way they have to respond. I mean, if you have just found out your conversation partner is a medical doctor, do you ask whether she thinks the AMA and FDA are just fronts for pharmaceutical companies who don't want us to know The Truth About Echinacea? When you discover you are talking to an astrophysicist, do you inquire whether the Apollo program really was just a bunch of camera tricks like in Capricorn One and that Fox TV special? When you discover your conversation partner is a rabbi, do you ask what he thinks the Mossad was really behind 9/11?  And with a straight face?!  Is Christian theology really taken this unseriously? Do my fellow citizens really expect me to offer a scholarly assessment of a mystery thriller that gets its facts wrong, revels in speculative fantasy, and indulges in the centuries-old security blanket of modernity that is anti-Catholicism? We theologians deserve a lot of criticism for the ways we have abused our discipline, but this is literally ridiculous.  4. I take heart in discovering that Catholics still turn up in liberal nightmares. That is more than mainline Protestants can say. Looks like we evangelicals have some competition after all!

      I've often wondered why John Edwards' campaign hasn't taken off.  I think he's got a great message.  He's running a positive campaign, and voters say they're tired of negative politics.  True, he's relatively inexperienced.  Lacking the name recognition that Minority Leader Gephardt, General Clark and internet warrior Dean enjoy, Edwards hasn't cracked the single digits in key polls.    But finally the Edwards campaign is catching fire.   urlLink Yesterday the Des Moines Register endorsed Edwards .  It's worth clicking on the link.  The editorial explains that an Edwards versus Bush election would present voters with a clear choice, both in terms of life stories and political philosophy.  Bush, his cowboy boots notwithstanding, is an elitist.  He is a Yale educated President's son.  His tax policies reward the friends of his family.    Edwards is a mill worker's son, a graduate of public universities, including  urlLink my alma mater , who made (not inherited) a fortune suing corporations on behalf of individuals who lost life and limb due to malfeasance.  Edwards would roll back Bush's tax giveaways to the rich.   urlLink The Charlotte Observer  also reports that undecideds in Iowa are flocking to Edwards.  He can't win Iowa, but if he places third there, and third in New Hampshire, and wins South Carolina, then he'll be one of the one or two candidates left standing in addition to Howard Dean.    Then Democrats in later primaries will have to decide if they want to nominate their favorite candidate, or a candidate that stands a chance of beating Bush.  As Eric Alterman has said, voting isn't therapy.  It's about  relative  strengths and weaknesses,  relative  gains and losses.  Democrats who won't let the perfect be the enemy of the good will look more and more to Edwards.

      I'm getting my exercise groove back.  Sunday afternoon I was watching the Colts outscore the Chiefs and rummaging through the Sunday paper when I stumbled across a picture of some runners in Saturday's Charlotte marathon.  I began to feel a little oafish, Cheerwine in hand, watching 300 lb. men push each other around on the tube.  I looked out the window, and the beautiful blue sky called to me.  So I went for a Sunday afternoon run.  Normally I don't run on Sundays.  I'm exhausted after church.  But more than that, running has begun to feel a bit like work to me--a chore like flossing your teeth or changing the batteries in the smoke detectors, bodily preventive maintenance--and who wants to do chores on a Sunday afternoon?  But yesterday was different.  I ran to get outdoors on a gorgeous afternoon.  Sure it was cold, but the mid-30s are ideal running temperatures, especially if it's sunny and you're absorbing the heat in your black tights and black long-sleeved shirt.  You don't sweat much.  You "glow," like some elegant actress from a movie in the '30s.  You feel warm but not hot.  I decided not to do my ordinary routes, measured down to the tenth of a mile.  Again, I didn't want this to be work.  So I explored the historic district and noticed a huge holly tree with oragish-red berries, more like a pyrocantha than a holly.  I don't know how far I ran, or how long I was gone.  But I felt great when I got back.  I think that exercise has to be fun for me to stick at it with any regularity.  I can't be about keeping the love handles at bay, and at this point, it can't even be about getting ready for a race.  Too regimented:  hills on Monday, long run on Saturday, ack!  If I'm going to exercise frequently, I think that it will simply have to be an opportunity to get out and see the neighborhood and appreciate God's good creation.

      Last night, we watched A Mighty Wind, another pseudodocumentary from the This Is Spinal Tap people.  The plot:  a legendary folk music promoter dies.  His anal retentive son organizes a tribute concert, broadcast live on the "Public Broadcasting Network."  The years haven't been kind to the musicians he assembles; they've descended into pretentiousness, mental instability, or kitchiness.  Somehow, they manage to redeem themselves with a concert that's… well… pleasing to their most ardent fans.    A Mighty Wind is satire, and there are several laugh out loud moments, such as when one of the musicians explains that they had to switch record labels when one of their albums was released without a hole in the center.  (Remember the volume switch that went up to eleven in This Is Spinal Tap?)  Rent the DVD, and watch the deleted scenes.  Some are among the funniest in the movie.  However, the music was so bad, it left the realm of satire and went into the territory of "Painful to Watch or Listen To."    I've decided that Thomas Wolfe is a good writer after all.  I'm not exactly ripping through the pages of Look Homeward Angel, but Wolfe, like most southern authors, wasn't out to write a page turner (John Grisham notwithstanding). He's painting a portrait, lush, vivid, and extremely detailed, of the inner life of a growing boy at the turn of the last century and his environment, the people, geography and architecture of Altamont, North Carolina.   urlLink My complaint about Wolfe's overwrought descriptions  sounded a lot like the Emperor's complaint in Amadeus that Mozart's symphonies had "too many notes."

      Here's why:  I'm going to praise the President's new immigration policy.  In a sense, it's the equivalent of raising the interstate speed limit.  It merely blesses the current situation--flagrant abuse of the law.    Employers are supposed to hire only legal workers.  The government is supposed to stop illegals at the border.  But just look at any crew maintaining the landscape at your office or working in a field, and you know that this is a fiction.  The new plan will allow undocumented workers to obtain three year work permits in the U.S.  They can come and go through the border.  There are incentives to return home after they've worked for a while in States.  Also, the caps on legal immigration will be raised.    To those who say that the new proposal doesn't go far enough, the President replied that it would be unfair to reward people for breaking the law when there are plenty waiting to get into the country legally. To the nativists who want to crack down on illegals, the President spoke (movingly) about how America is an immigrant nation, and each generation of Americans has concluded that we benefit from the wisdom and thirst for freedom that immigrants bring to our shores.  Maybe it doesn't go far enough, but it's a fine start.  This is true compassionate conservatism.  It fulfills the biblical injunction to care for the "widows, orphans and aliens in your midst."    Critics think that the President's merely angling for Hispanic votes.  So what?  This reform is the right thing to do, and when the President does the right thing, he deserves the credit, even when the President is George W. Bush.    One should remember that this plan was in the pipe until 9/11 when the government, frantically trying to get a handle on terrorists slipping into the country, yanked it.  That's another reason to mourn that terrible day.  Were it not for 9/11 we might have had a truly compassionate and conservative administration, meting out measured but effective reforms.  First the President's thoughtful compromise on stem cell research, then immigration reform, and who knows what else?  But 9/11 "changed everything," as they say...

       I was at the hospital this morning  while a parishioner underwent knee replacement surgery.  Did you know that they can put in a new knee in an hour?  I've had oil changes that took longer than that.   Please, pretty please,  Major League Baseball; reinstate Pete Rose.  I need a new reason to loathe that sport.   Sop to Hinkle:   I've changed my mind.  LSU is the real national champion.  Why?  Because a loss to the mighty Auburn Tigers is worth six or seven victories over those Pac 10 sissies.   Howard Dean served up  some red meat on NPR's radio debate today.  Or is it extra firm tofu for the Birkenstock-wearing crowd who adores him?  (Disclosure:  I have bought extra firm tofu AND Ben and Jerrys in one grocery store visit).  When asked how he'd be the President of all the American people, he said that he'd never compromise with the far right of the Republican Party, because the Tom DeLays of this world care more about the success of the party than they do the success of the country.  Now who would you guess took him to task for this?  Not Joe ("Me too, Me too") Lieberman, easily the most conservative Democrat in the race.  It was Dennis Kucinich.  The Loony Leftist said that he can work with anybody, with Naderites on the environment, with libertarians on the Patriot Act, with conservatives on restoring American sovereignty by getting out of the WTO, and with Democrats who want an FDR-type in the White House.  And, he added, it does no good to label people "the enemy" when you need their votes in Congress to get things done.  I go back and forth on Dean.  All these guys have huge egos, but DeLay's thirst for power and his political vision make him pretty frightening to me.  Dean's comments left me feeling grimly satisfied.    But what good does it do to demonize anybody, aside from firing up the choir?  Do you want to get anything done, or do you simply want to beat the other guys?  I know what Dean's against, but I don't know what he's for.    I do know what Gephardt, Kucinich, Kerry, Edwards and Lieberman are for (although I don't like the Republican-lite that Connecticut Joe is serving up).  Gephardt talked about a global minimum wage.  That's a pipe dream, but it's one that you'll wake up to with a smile on your face.  All good ideas started out as pipe dreams:  integrated schools, health insurance for aged, etc.  Dean's extra firm tofu tastes oh-so-good, but it doesn't satisfy.  The others are serving up stuff that'll stick to your bones.

      Yes, Dear Reader, he's absolutely right.  Capturing Saddam did NOT make the U.S. safer.  The Doc points out the obvious:  since Saddam's capture the insurgency hasn't skipped a beat.  They continue to kill and maim American soldiers, while close to home U.S. fighter jets must tail foreign jet liners through U.S. airspace.  And for pointing out the obvious he gets skewered.  I swear, every day that passes since 09/11/2001 feels like a deeper and deeper descent down the rabbit hole.  It is clear now, to those who have eyes to see, that prior to the war Iraq posed a minimal security threat to the U.S. and its allies in the Gulf.  Where are the WMDs?  Where are they?  Where are they?  Where are they?  Remember, the ones Tony Blair said could be operational in 45 minutes?  But thanks to the war, Iraq now constitutes a major security problem for the U.S.  If there's anyone more secure after the war, it's the Iraqi people.  Well, some of them, some of the time.  Before the war they had to fear being picked up by the secret police.  After the war they have to fear being blown to smithereens by crazed jihadists.  Perhaps the insecurity hasn't gone, but metamorphasized.  Where would we be if we hadn't gone to war?  If we'd allowed the inspections teams to work, backed up by the credible threat of force?  Not any less safe; we know now that there were no WMDs.  On the other hand, Saddam would still be in power.  Or would he?  Supposedly invincible tyrants usually fall with little or no warning.  How many of you knew on July 4, 1989 that the Berlin Wall would fall just three months later?  Patience may have opened up an opportunity for Iraqis to liberate themselves.  Or not.  We'll never know.  At any rate, I find it more than hypocritical that the same Republicans who said "we can't be the world's policeman" back in the 1990s now celebrate a war that's cost us over $100 billion, hundreds of dead and wounded military personnel, and embroiled us in the long term occupation of a state in the world's most unstable region, just because one of the dozens of tyrants in the world in no longer in power.  But if you can't take Dr. Dean's word for it, or mine, then maybe you'll take the word of this  urlLink pinko, commie, self-hating, seditious leftist .

      Oh boy!  I can't wait til tonight when the Sugar Bowl will decide who college football's National... runnerup is.  Told you the Panthers would beat the Cowboys.  Dallas is a poor team with a great coach.  Parcells got them to play over their heads all season long, but there had to be a reckoning come playoff time.  Carolina is not a superior team, and they aren't even a great team, but they have no obvious weaknesses, and in the "Age of Parity" that means they can beat just about anybody.  Last night's performance was textbook.  Muhammad had a big first half.  That freed Davis and the offensive line to move the ball on the ground.  And then in the second half Delhomme turned to Steve Smith.  All the big players made big plays.  Don't even know who won today.  It's 75 degrees in Salisbury.  I took my post-sermon nap, ate birthday cake next door, and took a walk in the park.

      I'm learning that some of my most faithful readers are the people in my life that couldn't disagree with me more when it comes to politics.  I don't care, so long as you're reading!  (Which, Amy, is more than we can say for the President, who doesn't bother to read the newspaper.  Tell John I said that his wife is more intellectually curious than the leader of the free world).  One reader complained that a blog like mine cries out for a comment link.  He finds the experience of staring at the claptrap known as The Ivy Bush with no opportunity to rebut my nonsense extremely frustrating.  I'm working on it, but Blogger seems to be in the midst of some huge reorganization.  They won't even take my $15 to get rid of the banner ad, much less the additional money for a super-duper template with a comment board.  Patience Gentle Reader.

      Wacko Jacko is playing the race card.  I saw one of his apologists on CNN this morning.  He explained the boys in the bed thing thusly:  In the days of segregation, few and far between were hotels that accommodated African Americans.  Black travelers found lodging in black households in towns they passed through.  That meant everybody piling into the few available beds, including grownups and children.    So it's this long tradition, see?  No you don't see.  A black man who's turned himself into a white women who sleeps with prepubescent boys in his multimillion dollar fantasy land estate is, apparently, A BLACK THING.  YOU WOULDN"T UNDERSTAND.    But the most bizarre statement in the interview was the concluding comment of the CNN anchor.  She said that Wacko Jacko was lucky to have friends like this man.  Ahem, I beg to differ.  A couple of years ago Michael Jackson needed a "friend" tell him, "You settled a sex abuse lawsuit for millions and you're STILL letting boys get in bed with you?  Are you crazy? Cut it out!"

      Now that I've finished watching Angels in America, I've turned to reading Thomas Wolfe's novel  Look Homeward, Angel .  Clearly I've got a case of "Angels on the Brain."  Plus, after watching six hours of gay New Yorkers on HBO, I needed to focus on something a little closer to home.  Asheville, the "Altamont" of  Look Homeward, Angel , is just a two hour drive from Salisbury.  Wolfe piles up adjectives like his character W.O. Gant piles up firewood in the fireplace and food on the breakfast table.  I can't decide if Wolfe is a breathtakingly descriptive writer, of if he needs to put away that thesaurus and get a good editor with lots of red ink pens.  Consider this sentence:   His life was like that river, rich with its own deposited and onward-borne agglutinations, fecund with its sedimentary accretions, filled inexhaustably by life in order to be more richly itself, and this life, with the great purpose of a river, he emptied now into the harbor of his house, the sufficient haven of itself, for whom the gnarled vines wove round him thrice, the earth burgeoned with abundant fruit and blossom, the fire burnt madly .  Now, is that an utterly beautiful sentence or an utterly dreadful one?  What do you think?  P.S.  "Agglutinations" are masses formed by the gluing or clumping together of matter.  Don't mention it...

      It looks like the upper Midwest outside my window.  The roads are plowed clean.  The snow is piled deep.  It's not the usual glassy sheet of sleet melted and refrozen overnight.  It's--beautiful!  I don't even mind that I can't plant peas today.  The Passion is quickly becoming the King James Version in celluloid.  Eric Alterman posted  urlLink an email  on his weblog Friday from an irate reader who said, in effect, How dare you criticize a direct translation of the Bible?  The phrase "Direct translation" appeared twice.  Dude, it's a movie; it ain't the fifth gospel.  Criticizing The Passion doesn't make you an atheist, any more than liking it necessarily makes you an anti-Semite.  A little sacramental theology as it relates to the big screen in general:  movies, however edifying, are not as effective visual presentations of Christ as the sacraments are.  Baptism and Holy Communion are signs of the death and resurrection of Christ, and because they are ordained by God, they actually present the thing they signify.  So he who goes to see The Passion in order to see Christ may do well (or poorly), but he who goes to church tomorrow to eat the bread and drink the cup does better.  Dare I watch the State-Carolina game tomorrow?  Dare I?

      President Bush was to visit Charlotte today.  On the agenda:  pressing the flesh at Central Piedmont Community College, and hosting a $2,000 per plate fundraising dinner.  Alas, the snowstorm forced him to cancel the trip.  Think about it:  as we speak, there are scores of Republicans in the Queen City with two grand burning a hole in their pocket, and too much time on their hands.  Oh to be  urlLink a waitress at Hooters tonight !

      OK, OK, OK, I will go see the movie after all.  Sheesh.  I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't.  I saw the  urlLink Jesus  movie in seminary--the one that the Baptists mailed to every household in Rowan County, and I hated it.  So sentimental.  So nostalgic.  And now I'm not going to see The Passion because it's too violent?  Well, I can't very well trash Jesus for its lack of realism and refuse to see The Passion because it's TOO realistic.  Besides, I've seen plenty of movies that the right hates.  I've seen  urlLink The Last Temptation of Christ .  I've seen  urlLink Dogma .  If I'm not willing to see a movie that might offend people on my side of the aisle, then I'm not the open-minded kind of guy that I keep telling myself I am.  Hinkle has seen it, and he's reviewed it for his congregation.  Hinkle, now that you've figured out how to use the Comment link, why don't you post your review here?  In fact, everyone who's seen the movie, play Roger Ebert and tell us what you think.

      My  urlLink spring fever's  about to be buried in eight inches of snow.  Sigh.  At least the berries on our newly planted hollies will sparkle in all the white.  Loose quote:  "I can't trust Bush as far as I can throw him."  Who said it?  Molly Ivans?   urlLink Comrade Columbine ?  Dennis Kucinich?  Nosiree.   urlLink A local Republican big shot  said it.  A question for you Carolina fans--could Matt Doherty have done any worse?  Hinkle--here's more  urlLink fence-sitting, talking out of both sides of your mouth hand-wringing over gay marriage .  Actually, you're all welcome to read the post.  I'm curious about your thoughts on the author's proposal to sever Christian marriage from civil unions:  Go to the magistrate's office to get legal recognition for your relationship, and then head for the Church if you want a Christian marriage ceremony.  Isn't that what they do in France?  I wonder, if Christian ministers no longer had authority to act on behalf of the state, would we have more or less people showing up, wanting to get married in our churches, even though they have no intention of ever darkening the door of a house of worship again?

      No, I have not seen  urlLink THAT movie , and I have nothing to say about  urlLink THAT movie  that  urlLink hasn't already been said .    Last night Laura and I began watching  urlLink Far From Heaven .  If you haven't seen it, it's about a perfect 1950s familiy troubled by the husband's attraction to other men, and the wife's friendship with a handsome "negro" groundskeeper.  We got as far as the scene where Dennis Quaid tells his shrink that he's determined to defeat his homosexual tendencies.  We paused the movie when someone called for Laura.  After she got off the phone, we both decided we'd seen enough.  I felt like the movie was mocking its main characters with their own internal pain.  Or was it mocking a false image of the 1950s as an idylic decade?  They dress and act like characters from Father Knows Best.  Did everyone in the 1950s carry on like that?  Surely not.  I didn't live through the Fifties, but I can't believe that they were as good as nostalgic conservatives remember them, or as white bread as cynical liberals scorn them.  Wasn't there a war in the Fifties that killed 36,000 Americans?  Weren't children getting ready for nuclear war by ducking under their chairs at school?  There's more angst in that decade than any Nirvana loving, coming of age in the 1990s person could possibly understand.  Anyway, the movie was vaguely depressing, kind of creepy, and I don't know if we'll ever finish it.  On the other hand, I've grown to enjoy our Monday evening screenings of Krzysztof Kieslowski's  urlLink The Decalogue .  The Polish director made ten, one hour films about each of the ten commandments for Polish television in 1987-8.  Each is set in a vast apartment complex in Warsaw.  Some major characters in one episode re-appear as minor characters in other episodes, but each one hour film is a discreet story that doesn't build on what's happened before.  Some of the plots have, at best, an oblique relationship to the commandment at hand.  Perhaps Kieslowski means to prove that the commandment has far greater relevance to our everyday lives than the letter of the law might at first indicate.  In that vein, he's not far from  urlLink The Larger Catechism's  treatment of the Decalogue.  In its Q and A on "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain," The Larger Catechism states that this rules out, among other things, cursing, violating oaths, curious and unprofitable questions, and being ashamed of your religion.    In The Decalogue episode on the same, a woman wants her husband's doctor to swear to her whether he will live or die.  She is pregnant with another man's child.  If her husband is to recover, she'll get an abortion, but if not, she'll keep the baby.  The doctor, for his own (good?) reasons, lies about the man's prognosis.  We couldn't decide if the commandment was broken by the doctor when he lied or by the woman when she broke her marriage vow, or both or neither!  We've also noted that these movies obviously weren't made in Hollywood because thus far we've seen only one car chase.  And while there are handsome men and pretty women in the movies, they aren't airbrushed, personal trainer sculpted beautiful.  If you're in Salisbury on Mondays at 7:30,  urlLink join us .

      After reading  urlLink this , all I can say is, the man is in trouble, and he knows it.  When an incumbent runs for re-election, the overwhelming issue is the incumbent's record.  If the incumbent himself opens his campaign by attacking the challenger (and we don't even know for sure yet if the Junior Senator from Massachusetts is going to be the challenger) rather than touting his accomplishments, then that's an amazing sign of weakness.  Not that he has a choice.  What can he point to in the way of accomplishments?  The states (even the red ones like Virginia and Utah) are in open revolt over the No Child Left Behind Act, the signature piece of compassionate conservative legislation.  He has the worst jobs creation record since Herbert Hoover.  Iraq is a mess, threatening to become a quagmire.  I haven't met an old fogey yet who's pleased with the Medicare Reform bill, and those people vote, unlike my generation.  Washington is hemorrhaging red ink.    And then there are the scandals and near-scandals:  blowing the cover of a CIA operative in order to pay back his spouse for telling the truth on pre-war intelligence.  An energy bill written by Big Oil.  And on Capital Hill, his cronies in the Senate are being investigated for hacking into Democratic computers and stealing political strategy related to judicial nominees.  Accomplishments?  This administration overthrew the Taliban after the September 11 attacks.  But it's hard to imagine any administration not doing the same.  That was a no-brainer and a slam dunk.  The President does have one thing on his side:  $110,000,000 in his campaign war chest.  And maybe the Special Forces will do him a favor and capture Osama bin Laden come October.  Otherwise, either Kerry or Edwards can say, "Look at the record; look at the record; look at the record," all the way to the White House.

      I've come down with full-blown spring fever.  Friday it was nearly 70 degrees.  I borrowed Hoyt's truck, and got it filled with compost at the city landfill.  Saturday we bought bushes and planted them.    The kids are getting old enough to be of real help when they say they want to "help me" in the yard.  I showed them where to dig the holes for the bushes, and they went straight to work.  Andrew with a trowel, and Ethan with the shovel, managed to put a decent hole in the ground before they announced, "We're tired.  You finish Daddy."   This reminds me--oddly enough--of Gerrish's chapter on baptism in his book  urlLink Grace and Gratitude .  Gerrish writes that both  urlLink John Calvin  and "the sounder Schoolmen," as Calvin called the medieval Catholic theologians, agreed that salvation was a gift from God.  Where the scholastics went wrong, in Calvin's opinion, was letting works in the back door after they'd barred them at the front door.  They taught that once accepted by God through faith in Christ, one remains in that state of salvation by the merit of good works.    Calvin hated this idea because he thought it changed the relationship between God and human beings to a master-servant relationship, rather than a parent-child relationship.  True, the Bible speaks of rewards for good behavior.  But they are not wages paid to employees who may be fired at will; they are an inheritance coming to those who are God's children because Jesus Christ is their brother.  It is the merit of Christ alone which enables us to be adopted once and for all into the household of the heavenly Father.  Calvin writes:     In short, those who are bound by the law are like servants on whom their masters impose certain tasks each day.  Unless the exact measure of their tasks is met, they think they have achieved nothing and dare not face their masters.  But children, who are dealt with more generously and more liberally by their fathers, do not hesitate to show them unfinished projects that they have only begun, or even spoiled a little.  Even if they have not succeeded in doing quite what they wanted, they are confident that their obedience and readiness of mind will be accepted.     Wow.  My obedience to God is not unlike the "half holes" my children dug for me Saturday.  This is humbling; I'd like to give my ethics and the congregation's good deeds more credit than that.  But it's comforting and freeing as well.  God's not going to throw me out on my ear when I screw up any more than I'm going to hire a landscaper and turn my kids over to the DSS for not digging those holes deep enough.    "Once accepted by God through faith in Jesus Christ, one remains in that state of salvation by the merit of good works."  Wow again.  Late medieval Catholicism lives on--in Protestantism!  Especially in those Protestant denominations where faith in Christ is allegedly of supreme importance--the Baptists and the Pentecostals.  What is all the talk about "backsliding" if it does not put the salvation monkey back on the shoulders of the individual?  If it does not recast the relationship between God and humanity as a fearful, anxious, master-servant relationship, rather than a loving parent-beloved child relationship?  If it, in the end, it overthrows faith in favor of works?    My kingdom for a true Protestant!

      The Wolfpack defeated the Huskies tonight.  Hooray!  Except--that trip home for the Washington team has got to be a killer.  Five hours in the air,  plus the drive time to and from the airports, plus check-in, etc.  I know that they'll make some of it back on the time change, but it's a heck of a trip, and losing to boot, and you're nineteen years old, and tomorrow you've got class.  Why didn't they schedule the game for a Saturday?  No wait, let me answer my own question--TV.  Brother John, we can add student athletes to the NASCAR drivers already on the Human Rights Watch.

      I'm going to do some thinking out loud about same-sex marriage.  If this is an issue that you can't be civil about when confronted with a different point of view, just move along…  One part of me is sanguine about same-sex marriage.  They said that they sky would fall when interracial marriage was Oked.  They were wrong. I don't think that the world will come to an end if at some point two to five of every one hundred marriage licenses are granted to homosexuals.    On the other hand, brother John warned me today, "You're crazy if you think it stops here.  After a while you'll hear about all the pain and anguish that the lesbian couple must endure when they can't codify their relationship with their child's sperm donor."  In other words, gay marriage begets polygamy.    I'm not a big fan of slippery slope arguments.  But just the other day I heard a liberal on  urlLink NPR's Talk of the Nation  making the conservative case.  "We ought to let gays marry," he said, "because that will lead to breaking the monogamy stranglehold on marriage.  The insistence on monogamy has been so problematic for marriage."    Um, let me beg to differ on a number of counts.  Whose fault is adultery, the institution of marriage with its rigorous standards, or the fallible (dare I use that anachronistic adjective "sinful"?) people who enter the covenant?  Solving the adultery problem by legalizing polygamy sounds like morality inflation to me.  Just how many people would you have to marry, anyway, before you weren't tempted with having sex outside your marriage contract?  For some people, there may not be enough.    One upon a time, marriage was an economic relationship.  Today it's an emotional relationship, but the economic dimension of marriage endures.  Get married, and who will inherit your property and who will have custody of your children in the event of your death is automatically decided.  Polygamy would make matters far more complicated.    Western cultures gave up on polygamy because they slowly but steadily awakened to the idea that women were fully human too, and polygamy was a bad deal for women.  Is ripping up the play book on marriage good or bad for women?    It seems as though we are moving toward a minimalist definition of marriage.  In the past, marriage was an institution ordained by God for the birth and nurture of children, for the ordering of human society, and so forth.  In the future marriage may be just another contract whose meaning is determined solely by the parties involved.  If endorsing gay marriage means going down that radically libertarian road, then I don't want to go there.  Let me put it another way.  If gays and lesbians and their allies are saying to married folks, "We want a slice of your pie," then I'm open to that.  If they're saying, "We're going to take your pie, and stuff it in your face," then that's another matter altogether.

      I wouldn't say that I have a love-hate relationship with  urlLink New Testament scholar Marcus Borg .  It's more like I have highly qualified praise for him.  I appreciate his image of Jesus as a God-intoxicated, prophetic troubler of the status quo.  Borg, along with Walter Wink, is healing the split in the church between "spirituality" types and "social justice" Christians.  I get uncomfortable with Borg's metaphorical handling of classic Christian dogmas.  For Borg, the Chalcedonian formula that Jesus is "two natures in one person" is richly symbolic, but doesn't communicate a metaphysical truth about the nature of the carpenter's son from Nazareth.  I wonder why I have to choose between Jesus as a Jewish shaman and purveyor of unconventional wisdom, and Jesus as fully human-fully divine.  Can't I have them both?   urlLink Walter Brueggemann , my Old Testament professor in seminary, reviews  urlLink Borg's latest book  in the current  Christian Century .  He succinctly states both my enthusiasm for, and reservations about Borg's approach.  Brueggemann lauds Borg for offering a vision of Christianity that may win over recovering fundamentalists.  At the same time Brueggemann wonders whether Borg's neat division of Christianity into an old paradigm and a new paradigm is accurate or helpful:   In (Borg's) reading, the Bible is either a human document or the divine word.  God is either a demanding lawgiver or a generous giver of transformative energy.  Jesus must be seen as either a metaphor and sacrament of God or we are stuck with irrelevent formulae cast in inpenetrable rhetoric.   Brueggemann detects a Manicheistic tone in Borg's categories, ironically typical of fundamentalists.  However, he also writes that he's ready to celebrate the book because it may energize a certain segment of jaded Christians.  I grew up in a traditional, orthodox faith environment in which Christian dogmas were helpful and fully reliable truths.  I didn't get beat over the head with them, and my Sunday School teachers, parents, and ministers didn't use them to hammer away at outsiders.  To me, Borg seems at times to be throwing the baby out with the bathwater.    I am aware, however, that not everyone grew up in such an irenic religious environment. If Borg's work helps them unload their old baggage, and  urlLink get reacquainted with Jesus , well then, he deserves at least two cheers for that.

      I link to  urlLink Tikkun  because it's one of the few magazines in the American press that presents a "fair and balanced" assessment of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  In other words, Tikkun is sharply critical of the Sharon government.  An added bonus:  the editor is a rabbi, thus it's hard to slap the anti-Semite label on them just for criticizing the Israelis, a nasty rhetorical tactic employed with increasing enthusiam in these strange post-9/11 times.  But  urlLink this Tikkun article by Gulf War veteran and erstwhile WMD head honcho Scott Ritter  irritates me to no end.  In short, Ritter faults John Kerry for not putting Ritter's more benign assessment of the Iraqi WMD program front and center when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held hearings on Iraq in 2002.  He also criticizes Kerry for voting for the Iraqi War resolution in the fall of 2002.  Kerry, says Ritter, shares in President Bush's culpability for waging an unjust war, and if he wants to be President then he needs to convince Americans that he will provide better leadership.  Well, I was against the war resolution too, and I urged my Senators and Congressman to vote against it.  But neither Kerry nor Edwards heeded my great advice, and now one of them seems destined to be the Democratic nominee.  What should I do?  Attend the North Carolina caucus in April and vote for Dennis Kucinich?  Or even better, cast my vote in November for  urlLink Mr. Unsafe At Any Election  ?  I may as well put a Bush-Cheney sign in my yard.  No one can accuse Scott Ritter of being a wallflower.  The article reeks of the foul scent of a man whose fifteen minutes of fame has passed him by, a man who has to blame somebody for not adding a few seconds to the clock.  If attacking the Democratic frontrunner on his left flank gets him back in the news, then that's what Scott Ritter will do.    The logical implication of Ritter's argument is that, were Kerry elected in 2000, we'd be in exactly the same quagmire we're in today.  Anybody who seriously believes that lacks all political seriousness.  Both Kerry and Edwards will return U.S. foreign policy to where it was during the 1990s.  That means a more restrained use of military force, and a greater willingness to work through multinational organizations such as NATO and the UN.  Both Kerry and Edwards present a real contrast with President Bush on foreign policy.  If Ritter can't see that, he ought to ask any Republican.  They'd be glad to enlighten him.  It's time that the far left stopped making the perfect the enemy of the good.

      Brother John emailed me to curse the sports gods for letting Dale Jr. win Daytona AND A-Rod go to the Yankees the very same weekend.  I questioned his enthusiasm for two "sports" shot through with corruption.  I suggested that he resurrect his long dormant love of the Boston Celtics, and embrace the NBA, or some other more wholesome sport.  John's reply is worthy of wider distribution:   Ahh yes - the NBA...where the regular season means nothing, and the players act accordingly.  Please tell me why I should care about a sport where the players don't practice, routinely abuse the law and the fans (at least in Portland), and show no command of fundamentals (why do they even have a backboard anymore? - you don't need it to dunk or to swish a 35 foot jumper, which is all anyone ever attempts, it seems).  But you are exactly right about MLB and NASCAR.  Paul Tagliabue basically threw MLB under a bus this week after the AG leveled his indictments last Friday in the steroid scam.  He essentially said "unlike baseball, we have a real testing policy that hits everyone and hits them during the offseason, which is precisely when you would expect players to be using the juice."    As for NASCAR, when is some human rights group going to take note of the fact that slavery (or at least indentured servitude) still exists in America?  I can understand putting up with it if you're Junior, or Gordon - but what the heck are people like Derrick Cope and Johnny Benson still doing racing?  What do they get for putting their life at risk every Sunday?  Cope already has a nice full head of hair thanks to his endorsement of Avacor - he could find a nice girlfriend a live out his last 20-30 years in peace.  I just don't get it.  But don't worry - I really don't care about NASCAR.  When they penalize the pole sitter (and relative unknown) Greg Biffle for "blocking" when he was in fourth place, taking him out of contention, and then do nothing as Junior and Stewart block all over the racetrack, you know that the fix is in.  The France Family = Jim McMahon.  All they need is someone to be the racin' Nature Boy.  I'd nominate Stewart, but he wouldn't go for it.  Maybe Jimmy Spencer could become the NASCAR version of "The Enforcer" -Arn Anderson.    Some owner should assemble all the cheap shot artists into one team -Spencer, Kurt Bush, Rusty Wallace, and maybe even Gordon.  The four horsemen ride again!!   And I thought that John would find fault with NASCAR because it's operated by the French!

      The Charlotte Observer reports that  urlLink the FDA is making it easier for human growth hormone  to be prescribed to children who have nothing wrong with them--except for that they're short.  I have a hard time not taking this personally.  In fact, every inch of my 5'6" frame bristles at the very idea.  Shortness a disease, and growth hormones the cure?  Give me a break.  The article begins, as all these health features do, with a personal testimony.  "Middle school was hell" for a certain short, smart boy in south Florida, we read.    Well, middle school was hell for me too.  I was short, and not a day went by that I didn't get picked on about it.  My name was and is Marvin, and I was known all over Lewis Chapel Junior High School as "Messy Marvin."  (Remember the Nestles' Quick commercial?)  I wore glasses too.  Short, four-eyed, a name like Marvin, and, Oh yes, I was on the honor roll too.  Verily, verily I say unto thee, I was a marked man in my pre-teen years.    I don't remember suffering a whole lot of anguish about this.  In my seventh grade year book there's a picture of me standing beside the tallest boy in the school.  His elbow is resting on my head.  I thought that it was kind of cool.  Sure I was short, and sure people picked on me about it.  But I didn't let it get to me.  I think that the self-confidence that my parents encouraged in me was of greater value than the  $25,000 in hormone shots that some parents are administering to their wee lads and lassies (yes, $25K to be tall!)  If I'd been tall, I'd have gotten picked on too.  If I'd been dumb they'd have used that against me as well.  If I'd been handsome, I wouldn't have been picked on, but I'd have been resented, and my classmates who watched  urlLink Revenge of the Nerds  would have taken perverse delight in superimposing my face over the faces of those beautiful people who got their just desserts in that movie.  "Middle school was hell" for everybody.  Who among us aches for the salad days of eighth grade, even the tall pretty ones among us?  There's another memory I have about short people and middle school--an unpleasant and bitter memory.  A member of my church youth group, same age as me, slightly shorter than me, died in the seventh grade of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.  I was told that he left a suicide note explaining that he was tired of getting picked on because he was short.  His death shocked and saddended me, and left me perplexed as well.  I distinctly remember thinking, "I get picked on because I'm short too, but I'm not about to kill myself over it."    You can't count on youth to always exercise good judgment.  Suicide, the saying goes, is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, making it especially tempting to people who haven't lived long enough to learn that "this too shall pass."  But we ought to be able to expect better judgment from adults and parents.  Pathologizing normal variations in the human family is not good judgment at all.

      February 22 is Transfiguration Sunday.  I'm preaching on the epistle lesson,  urlLink 2 Corinthians 3:12-4:2 .  The epistle is not too long; therefore I began my sermon preparation by reading all of 2 Corinthians.  I stumbled across this little verse in  urlLink chapter seven  that points beyond this Sunday to the season of Lent:   For godly grief produces a repentence that leads to salvation and brings no regret, but worldly grief produces regret.   Lent is a time for self-examination, repentence and meditation on the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross for our sins.  Tis the season for grief.  But if that grief leads us into the blind alley of regret, making us prisoners of a past that we cannot change, then there's nothing holy about that.  Feeling sorry for one's sins is not an end unto itself.  In fact, being unable to move out of guilt and into acceptance of God's mercy may be pride masquerading as humility.  If your sins are so great that even Almighty God is powerless to wipe them out, then you're a mighty fine sinner indeed!    Grief over sin is a means of transforming one's present situation in order that God can open up future possibilities that heretofore were closed.  So come Ash Wednesday don't begin wallowing.  Own up to your shortcomings and failures; ask for mercy, trust that it's there, and move on.

      We've been in denial.  We've had our heads in the sand.  We've simply refused to face facts.  But as time goes by the evidence mounts.  It's become a hulking mountain of indisputability, threatening to bury all who dare to avert their gaze.  At this point, any further denials are inexcusable, willful obfuscations.  Yes, it's about time we admitted it.   urlLink State has a pretty good ball team .  Sigh.  (And you thought I was talking about weapons of mass destruction!)

      The closer we get to February 25 the more the religion blogs focus on  The Passion .   urlLink Camassia has a thoughtful post  about the graphic violence purportedly in the film.  Though crucifixion was a painful form of death, it's supreme horror was the shame and humiliation that it brought upon the victim.  To the extent that Gibson's movie plays up the physical rather than the psychological pain of the cross, it may cause modern viewers to miss what the ancients saw as most repugnant about this form of execution, and what was truly "scandalous" to them about the notion of a crucified Messiah.  Click on the link.  It's one of several thoughtful postings on  The Passion .    I'm still doubting that I'll see it.  My time and money would probably be better spent on  The Gospel According to John  when it comes out on DVD.  A  Christian Century  review of the film said that it shows how the long dialogues in the gospel flow seamlessly, calling into question some scholarly opinions that Jesus' discourses in the fourth gospel are a patchwork of sayings stiched together by the evangelist.

      Happy birthday,  urlLink Buck !  Lucky for him, Mike was born on Friday, February 13, 1970.  Since February 13 falls on a Friday this year, Buck's 34th birthday must be quite special, like the upcoming birthdays for all those wretched people who've been waiting eight years to celebrate on February 29, not March 1 (No, I didn't miscount.  2000 wasn't a leap year; just like 1600 wasn't.  What, you aren't keeping track?)  I did, however, wrongly identify Lot as Abraham's brother in the previous post.  In fact, he's his nephew.  Thanks, Amy, for the correction.  Speaking of birthdays, my wife turned 35 last month, and she swears that the twenties are so overrated.  Mid-30s is where it's at.  Not much happened today.  Ethan had a great day at school.  I picked up a nut and bolt for my tree-trimmer.  Tomorrow I'll put it to use in the back yard.  But don't worry.  I'm not going to  urlLink go First Presbyterian Church on them .

      The Boston Globe has had wall to wall coverage of the Massachusetts Statehouse debate over same sex marriage.   urlLink This quote  from one article caught my eye:  ''God destroyed a whole city over this issue,'' said Linda Tardif, 27, principal of Independent Baptist Academy of the Anchor Baptist Church in Woburn, referring to the biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah. ''We're trying to save our city, our state. They see the gays and lesbians out here voicing their opinions and they know it's wrong and we want them to know that we stood up for what's right.''  God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah because of same sex marriage?  That's not what my Bible says.   urlLink Read the story here .  Better yet, read about Sodom and Gomorrah in its overall context.  Begin with  urlLink Genesis 18: 1 and read on to 19: 26.   To sum up, two angels arrive in Sodom one evening, and Lot, Abraham's brother, welcomes them into his home.  A crowd gathers at the door demanding that Lot turn over his guests "that we may know them" ("know" meaning carnal knowledge, sexual relations).  Lot, hospitable to a fault, offers his virgin daughters to the mob instead, but the men of Sodom press their demands for male flesh.  The angels strike the crowd with blindness, and escort Lot and his family out of the city just before God burns it to the ground.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but the Massachusetts Supreme Court didn't repeal laws against gang rape.  And gang rape is what we're dealing with in Genesis 19, not a gay or lesbian person who wants their assets to automatically go to their partner should they die.  If the sin of Sodom is homosexuality  per se , then doesn't that imply that they could have saved themselves had they settled for Lot's daughters?  Does anybody truly want to make that sort of argument?   urlLink Buck can check my logic  on this one.  The larger context defines the sin of Sodom as a failure to extend hospitality to strangers.  In those days inns were few and far between.  A primary ethical obligation was to feed and shelter travelers in one's own home, an obligation that we modern folk are unfamiliar with, given the multitude of hotels, motels, B&Bs, etc.  The story really begins with Abraham serving a meal to strangers at his tent.  The three men are, in fact, God, or God and two angels; it's unclear.  After God reveals to Abraham his intent to destroy Sodom, and Abraham gets him to agree to spare the city if he can find just ten righteous citizens there (which raises completely different yet equally thorny issues), two of the three men depart for Sodom.  Lot repeats Abraham's magnanimous gesture toward the men, but he is the exception in a town which is most inhospitable.  If the issue is hospitality to strangers and not sexual immorality, then doesn't the story of Sodom and Gomorrah urge us to welcome the homosexual?  Of all the "sexual sins" out there, which one is the "strangest" or the most "alien" in the eyes of society?  Domestic violence?  Adultery?  Homosexuality?  Put it this way, if Matthew Shepperd had walked into that bar with a Scarlet A on his chest for "Assault on a female," would he have been crucified to that fence post?  Probably not.  By all means, may our society condemn any mixing of sex and violence, be it gang rape, domestic violence, or the ritualized, eroticized violence at the Superbowl halftime show.  Let us insist on lifetime fidelity in sexual relations.  But let's not take scripture out of context to condemn people whose liftestyle bears no relation to the hateful residents of that city God rained fire and brimstone upon.

      Yesterday the junior Senator from Massachusetts took a giant leap toward the Democratic Presidential nomination.  Tomorrow President Bush will come out in favor of a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage.   urlLink Coincidence ?    Ha!  Look how quickly the Bush campaign morphs as Democratic front-runners come and go. When Howard Dean led in the polls, Bush's aides wrote him a State of the Union address that proclaimed "I won't ask anybody's permission to defend the United States."    That line doesn't work well against John Kerry, decorated Vietnam veteran.  But Kerry hails from a state whose high court is going to let boys marry boys and girls marry girls.  So the Bush campaign is fighting the culture war now, not the war on terrorism.  Where did Mister Compassionate Conservative, Mister "I'm a uniter not a divider" go?    The proposal is doomed to fail, and the Republicans know it.  Where are the 67 votes in the Senate to ban same sex marriage?  They don't exist. The President isn't serious about amending the Constitution; he serious about energizing his base.  It's an utterly cynical proposal.    Like it or not, our society is on a long, slow, inexorable march toward recognizing the legitimacy of some homosexual relationships (the monogamous, faithful ones; not the sex in a city park ones).  In the 1970s the American Psychiatric Association deleted homosexuality from the  urlLink DSM , its exhaustive list of mental disorders.  In the early 1990s the American Medical Association revoked a policy that called on doctors to try to change a homosexual's orientation.  In the 1990s corporations and municipalities began bestowing domestic partner benefits on their gay and lesbian employees.  Last year the Supreme Court struck down anti-sodomy laws, and the Episcopal Church ordained a gay bishop.    President Bush may win the election on the culture war front.  But the handwriting is on the wall.  This particular manifestation of the culture war is "all over but the shouting."

       urlLink This map at a conservative blog  gives Bush nearly 300 electoral votes.  The difference between his and the Edwards map is that he projects Iowa and New Mexico to go red this November.  He also projects the Democrats to win the popular vote again.  Sigh.  I love these maps.  When I was a kid, I used to stare at encyclopedia maps showing how the United States expanded over time.  I'd even trace them.  Over and over and over.  Too bad the  urlLink Geek Quiz  didn't ask about those tendencies.  My score would have soared!  There's a map store on Queen's Road in Charlotte that's on the way to my in-laws.  I vow and determine to go browsing there every time we drive past it, but haven't gotten in there yet.  It's probably a good thing.  I'd never leave the place if I ever entered it.

      The John Edwards website has an  urlLink interactive electoral college map .  You can see red and blue states in every election since 1980, and how they're predicted to go this year.    Play political consultant with the map.  Click on individual states, flip them from red to blue or vice versa, and see how that changes the electoral vote count.    The '04 map gives the Republicans a 278 to 260 lead.  270 is the magic number to win the election.  I can't see a blue state that the Republicans can conceivably flip to pad their advantage.  I thought about New Mexico, but brother John reminded me that with former Clinton cabinet official Bill Richardson in the governor's mansion, a red New Mexico is highly unlikely.    Conversely, nibbling around the edges will avail the Democrats nothing.  Even if they retook New Hampshire and West Virginia, they'd still come up short.  The Democrats need to flip Ohio (where Gore lost by 3.5% in 2000) or a southern state.  Tennessee and Kentucky are possibilities.  Both voted for Clinton in 1992 and 1996 (making Gore's failure to win his home state in 2000 all the more mind-boggling).  Louisiana may be in play, given the Democratic victory in last year's U.S. Senate race.    Click on the link above and tell me which states you think are up for grabs this year.  Click on it soon because unless Edwards does very well today, the  urlLink John Edwards 2004 web site  may soon be history.  Thanks to brother John who alerted me to this page, and thanks, brother John, whatever your motives, for casting a ballot for Edwards in today's Virginia primary.

      I'm reading B.A. Gerrish's book  urlLink Grace and Gratitude:  The Eucharistic Theology of John Calvin .  Gerrish notes that  urlLink John Calvin  is known far and wide for his doctrine of double predestination--that God elects some to eternal salvation and damns the rest to an eternity in hell.  Calvin's God as an arbitrary tyrant, to be feared and obeyed by his subjects simply because they are utterly powerless before him, right?  Gerrish is at pains to say that this God is a caricature.  For Calvin, the Father metaphor governs our understanding of God as Almighty.  As fathers love their children and provide for their needs, so the Almighty Father feeds his children with the bread of life--Jesus Christ.  Indeed more so.  Thus the Lord's Supper, not Double Predestination, is for Gerrish the hinge which opens the door into Calvin's theological mind.  Almighty Father, and Mother too!  Gerrish notes that pagan philosophers also imagined God as a loving parent.  But while Seneca thought that only the male parent was an adequate metaphor for God/the gods (mothers tend to spoil their children he alleged), Calvin thought that God's love was as much like a mother's as a father's.  This quote is from a sermon Calvin preached on the book of Job:   True, our Lord for his part becomes more familiar with us than anyone else.  He is like a nurse, like a mother.  He does not compare himself just with fathers, who are kind and good-natured with their children.  He says he is more like a mother or a nurse.  He uses such familiarity so that we shall not be like savage beasts anymore.   Of course Calvin was not a feminist in any contemporary sense of the word.  Calvin's experiments with feminine language for God seem motivated by a desire to be faithful to the text at hand (Job or  urlLink Isaiah 42 , for instance), and not a desire to elevate the status of women in society.    But that belies the arguments of church conservatives which equate all feminine God-talk with paganism.  To the contrary, the  sola pater  crowd talks a lot more like Seneca than Isaiah.  Now tell me who the real pagans are?

       Fear This   urlLink Isaiah 6: 1-13   (Luke 5: 1-11; 1 Cor. 15: 1-11)  "I saw the Lord."  Did you now?  For those of us who are desirous of some revelation, some mountain top experience, some experience of the divine, the prophet's claim peaks our interest.  "You saw the Lord?  Well tell us, Isaiah, what did you see?"  Isaiah saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lofty; the hem of God's robe filled the temple.  Isaiah saw a God literally too big to be contained by any sanctuary, too mysterious to be explained with any preacher's words or any worship liturgy.  "The whole earth is full of God's glory."  Isaiah saw a God so holy that even the angels flitting about can't bear to look that God in the face.  "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts," they sang, repeating the word three times for emphasis.  Smoke filled the temple.  The building reeled under the weight of the divine presence.  Isaiah's encounter with God was like being in the World Trade Center on 9/11.  A near death experience.  And Isaiah reacts as mortals who stare into the abyss typically do:  "Woe is me!"  he cried.  "I am lost."  Or as John Calvin translates it, "I've come undone."  In short, God scared the heck out of Isaiah.  And lest we write that off as "Old Testament God stuff" which is now replaced by our New Testament God of love, note that fear and dread and shame dominate both New Testament readings.  In a very different way Peter witnesses the glory of God, yet he reacts in much the same way as Isaiah:  "Get away from me Lord, for I am a sinful man."  In 1 Corinthians 15 Paul reminds us of the foundational events of the Christian faith, Good Friday and Easter.  When Jesus died on the cross to take away our sins, his disciples were in hiding, fearful that the fate of their Lord might become their own fate.  And early that Sunday morning when the women found his tomb empty, and heard the angels' Good News that He is risen, they did not break out the trumpets and sing Alleluias.  They ran for their lives.  The God of the Bible, so majestic, so awesome, so frightening, so...  different than our contemporary models of God.  We 21st century Americans have reduced and simplified the Almighty to a less threatening more manageable level.  Recently I read about a new congregation getting started in the region called "Dad's House."  Now isn't that chummy?  A God who's right there with you on the sofa, drinking beer, eating pretzels and watching the Superbowl.  I wonder what that God thought about Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake?  Or if not on the sofa then maybe our God a friendly guide on our journey of self-improvement.  Or a mascot for our favorite political cause.  Of a useful tool in keeping our kids from drinking and driving and having premarital sex.  For us, God is "user-friendly."  But if there is no fear in our relationship with God, then the God whom we serve is an idol of our own making.  The true God, who made heaven and earth, is far more powerful than we.  The true God, in whom there is no shadow or darkness, is far more holy than we.  We forget that at our peril.  In her book  urlLink Teaching a Stone to Talk  Annie Dillard warns us of the dangers of domesticating God.   "On the whole, I do not find Christians, outside of the catacombs, sufficiently sensible of conditions.  Does anyone have the foggiest idea what sort of power we so blithely invoke?  Or, as I suspect, does no one believe a word of it?  The churches are children playing on the floor with chemistry sets, mixing up a batch of TNT to kill a Sunday morning.  It is madness to wear... velvet hats to church; we should all be wearing crash helmets.  Ushers should issue life preservers and signal flares; they should lash us to our pews.  For the sleeping god may wake some day and take offense, or the waking god may draw us out to where we can never return."  The True God, the Holy God, fills us with fear.  But the True God, the Holy God, overcomes our fear, forgives our sins, and removes our shame.  One of the seraphs flies to the altar, takes a burning coal, touches Isaiah's lips, and pronounces him forgiven.  This act has a sacramental quality to it.  Sacraments are worship rituals, instituted by God, that confirm for us the Good News that we are forgiven.  We consume a pinch of bread, swallow a shot of grape juice, get our hair wet, or get our lips set on fire, and we discover that the Holy God desires to make us Holy, so that we can be in God's presence without fear, and serve God with joy.  Isaiah is overjoyed.  All these years of being a priest in the temple, only belatedly has he discovered that he's been playing with matches the whole time.  Today, Isaiah finally got burned, but joy of joys, the fire is a purifying fire, not a consuming fire.  He's seen God face to face and lived to tell about it, so when God mentions a job opportunity, Isaiah volunteers first and asks questions later.  "Here am I; send me!"  In retrospect, you wonder if Isaiah wished he'd looked before he leaped.  Isaiah will be no ordinary prophet.  Ordinary prophets convict God's people of sin, so that they can repent and avoid judgment.  But the words that God will give to Isaiah will have no such effect.  Instead of leading them to repentance, Isaiah will lead them to wrath.  The more he preaches, the more the people turn against the Lord, so that when the time for judgment comes, they will be utterly without excuse.  God gives Isaiah a simple yet inexplicable prophetic mission:  fail.  Isaiah's call to ministry raises a disturbing idea:  God's patience has its limits.  God gives individuals and societies many chances to turn over a new leaf, but sooner or later there comes a breaking point.  Beyond that point, God's love can only be expressed as discipline, even harsh discipline.  Isaiah's poetic imagery for judgment is vivid and disturbing: a mighty oak tree chopped down and the stump set ablaze.  Have we reached that point yet?  Is it too late for us as a society to save ourselves from the wrath of God?  When a government takes the nation to war on false pretenses, has that society finally run out of time with the Prince of Peace?  When there is so much violence against women and children in a society--that shocking videotape from Florida of the man kidnapping and murdering an 11 year old girl is Exhibit A--and when that same society's artistic and cultural elites ritualize and eroticize violence against women--the Superbowl is Exhibit B--is it too late for that society?  I don't know.  I'm not a prophet.  As some of us talked about in last week's Sunday School class, I have a hard time distinguishing the times and the seasons.  All I can say is:  We think of the mission of our congregation in prophetic terms.  John Calvin's statement of Identity and Mission, which the Session adopted in 1984, says that we are "to give ourselves and means to help fashion a just and benevolent social order."  We think it our task to make the world and our society a better place.  Isaiah's call reminds us that there are times in which that may be a mission impossible.  When and if our society goes beyond the point of no return, then your calling, as spokesmen and women for God, is not to transform society, but to put the judgment that falls upon us in context, so that the larger community can at least make sense of the tragedy that's befallen it.  Now who among us will sing, " urlLink Here I am, Lord ...?"  Isaiah himself has grave reservations about his new ministry.  "How long, Lord?"  he wonders.  Yet Isaiah puts aside his fear of failure, and begins to preach.  And preach and preach and preach.  Isaiah is the longest of the Old Testament prophets.  Why does he embrace this mission impossible?  A couple of reasons, I suspect.  One, that terrifying and glorious revelation in the temple.  No one likes to fail.  Everyone wants to be a success, especially where it appears to count so much, such as with life and death affairs, kingdom of God affairs.  But Isaiah has come face to face with the Almighty, Holy and Loving God.  What are our feeble successes or miserable failures in the face of such glory?  Isaiah foreshadows the ministry of Christ, "who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God."  Two, even a judgment on sinful Israel so bitter as to be likened to a smoldering oak tree stump, is not utterly bereft of hope.  Isaiah 6 concludes with a strange sentence:  The holy seed is its stump.  The blackened stump, Israel severely disciplined by God, is holy.  Even if a society goes beyond the point of no return, the judgment, while inevitable and unavoidable, is not the last word.  God's discipline, like the discipline of all good human parents, is always a manifestation of God's love.  Though Isaiah will fail to prevent disaster from overtaking Israel, and indeed he is called to fail, his mission will ultimately succeed because it is the will of the Holy God not to destroy or consume but to refine and purify.  We who have passed through the waters with the Lord, we who have tasted the bitterness of his death at this table, and been nourished by the bread of life at this same table, know that God's judgment is always a manifestation of God's love, and God's zeal to purify us, so that we can take our place with the angels in eternal praise of the holy God.  God is our refuge and strength; therefore we shall not fear though the earth should change, though the mountains shake in the heart of the sea.  When God says, "Whom shall I send?"  we disregard human calculations of success or failure.   urlLink Forgiven, loved and free , we say, "Here am I; send me.  Let me speak your beautiful wonderful words of life."

      Why "stuff?"  I got tired of the "yuck pot soup" title.  I have conducted my own little straw poll in advance of the Virginia primary.  Kerry holds a slim lead over Edwards.  My brother-in-law, a resident of Blacksburg, plans to vote for Kerry.  His wife says it's a toss-up between Edwards and Kerry.  Edwards got in the game when she found out that he's actually FIFTY YEARS OLD.  A half century on planet earth!  How much more qualified can you get?  Edwards' boyish good looks play well to some voters, but others conclude that the man lacks gravitas.  The Charlotte Observer reported that Edwards turned his campaign around in Iowa after he got a haircut.  I guess bangs look better on  urlLink The Ed Sullivan Show  than on the campaign trail.   On the other side of the family  (biological AND ideological), my brother, also a resident of the Old Dominion, though he is skipping the Democratic primary, reminded me that Senator Grassley, a member of the Intelligence Committee, no longer attends intelligence briefings because "they don't tell me anything that's not in the newspaper."  I don't doubt it.  The father of one of the two regular readers of this blog is a retired Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Army.  He was in "Army Intelligence," which his wife grumbled was a contradiction in terms.  Anyway, back when we were in high school we once asked him about his sources and methods.  "I read the New York Times every morning when I go to work," he deadpanned.  David Brooks says that  urlLink the problem with the CIA  is that they think intelligence is a science when it's an art.  Today's spies need to be experts on human nature and irrational behavior, given the threats of rogue states and Islamic nihilism.  A mob boss, or even somebody who's read a Dostoevsky novel lately would make an ideal Director of Central Intelligence.  Cool.  I could be a spy on two counts.  I read the newspaper of record (online), and I just polished off  urlLink The Brothers Karamazov .  OK, now that we've had some fun at Mr. Tenet's expense, I have to say that I'm still not convinced that there was an intelligence failure in the runup to the Iraq War.  I think that there was a policy failure.  Wasn't that why the Pentagon set up their own in-house spy agency?  Because they didn't like the data that the CIA was turning up on Iraq, data that's been vindicated by now?  Data like, Mr. Chalabi won't be welcomed with open arms by Iraqis?   We saw Lost in Translation last night .  Bill Murray plays, drum roll please, himself!  An successful actor whose best years are behind him, walking through late middle age with stoicism and just a hint of sarcasm.  He deserves an Oscar for this?  Nothing much happens in the movie.  He's lonely.  He's in Japan.  This young woman who accompanyed her husband on a business trip to Japan is also lonely.  They hang out in the hotel together, explore Tokyo, don't commit adultery, and then he flies home.  I liked it.  But I didn't love it.  I'm struggling with it.  Why should I hold it against the movie that nothing much happens?  That's life.  How many people, after all, get waylaid by goblins while on their way to throw a magic ring into a volcano?

      It just occured to me that  urlLink Teletubbies live in Hobbit holes .   A plague on both their houses:   It was hard to decide who to cheer for last night.  I settled on Carolina since a Tarheel victory would (incredibly) put State within reach of the regular season championship.  Laura decided to cheer for Duke last night, and Carolina next month, when the rematch takes place in Durham.  That way fans in both gyms would go home crying.   Revisionist history:   "We had a choice:  either take the word of a madman or take action to defend the American people."  President Bush, in a speech Thursday in South Carolina.  Er, No.  The choice in early 2003 was between a multilateral approach to the Iraqi threat, relying on an intrusive regime of weapons inspections authorized by the U.N., backed by the credible use of force, or a unilateral approach--go to war immediately war in violation of international law with less than a handful of allies and assorted hangers-on.    Expect more revisionism as casualties mount and WMDs stubbornly refuse to turn up.  What can you do?  Read the newspaper closely; listen to the TV and radio carefully; counter error with truth, myths with facts.  In short, maintain  urlLink constant vigilance  from here to November.   One of the big hits  of the "new" blue Presbyterian Hymnal is #525, Here I Am, Lord.  It's a soaring, inspirational celebration of God's call to ministry, based on Isaiah's call in Isaiah 6: 1-13.    I'm preaching on that text Sunday.  Unfortunately, the scripture itself is much darker than the hymn.  Isaiah nearly wets his pants when he's overwhelmed by a terrifying vision of God and the angels.  So thankful he is that he's survived this near death experience, he rashly offers his services to the Lord, whereupon he learns that his vocation as prophet won't lead the people to repentence.  To the contrary, his sermons will harden the people's hearts against the Lord in order that God can inflict harsh punishment on them.  Wish me luck...

      After  urlLink last night's victory , my Herb hated is looking increasingly irrational.  But the season's only half over.  Surely we'll collapse down the stretch!   urlLink In my posting on Janet's  "wardrobe malfunction" (that one belongs in the Euphemism Hall of Fame) I made reference to Manet's famous portrait  urlLink Olympia .  While Olympia doesn't rise to the level of obscenity, unlike Janet and Justin's halftime romp, it wasn't always that way.  Olympia was controversial when it debuted, not because the woman on the canvas was naked (innumerable nudes had already been painted by famous artists), but because the "hardened" look on her face made it clear that she was a prostitute.  For the time, it was a sexually explicit work of art.  Most moderns probably would have to look closely to see any difference between Olympia and other nudes.  Our highly sexualized culture has desensitized us to the subleties displayed in a work like Manet's.  Sort of like how all the high salt, high sugared junk food ruins our taste for fruits and vegetables.  Our palates are no longer sensitive enough to enjoy grapefruit or spinach...  Or the sex appeal of Katherine Hepburn.  Movie critic David Denby was on Fresh Air the other day talking about how the old movies were sexier than today's films, even though there was no nudity in them.  Just a look exchanged between Hepburn and Spencer Tracy was enough to make you all hot 'n' bothered.  Modesty isn't just prudishness.  It can be sexy.  There was nothing sexy about Janet Jackson's Superbowl exhibition.   I'm getting promotional packets for   urlLink The Passion .  Evangelical organizations want me to reach people for Christ with The Passion.  For $895 I can slam the neighborhood with 5,000 Passion postcards featuring Jesus' bloodied face.  Why are Evangelicals shilling for a Tridentine Roman Catholic who believes all non-Catholics are going to hell, even his Episcopalian wife?  Do they know how wacky Gibson's theology really is?   If Sendek hatred is irrational,  Bush dismay is utterly rational.  His proposed budget for fiscal year 2005 boasts a whopping $500 billion deficit.  And guess what?  The budget contains no money for military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq!  $500 billion in the hole just a year before the first baby boomers are eligible to retire.  "Apres moi, le deluge."

      My father-in-law used to own a red, corduroy shirt.  The sleeves were too short for him, so he gave it to me.  I wore it today, and you wouldn't believe how many people complimented me on it.  It's surprising.  I don't have a lot of red in my wardrobe, despite my prime collegiate athletic loyalty.  You'll usually find me in earth tones and darker blues.  What does that make me, a "fall?"  And to top it all off, Ethan's classmate Dakota told me that for a dollar I could join his club.  Yup.  I'm feeling pretty good about myself today.  The old self-esteem is in grrrreat shape!

      So's Justin on a first name basis with Janet Jackson or what?  As regular readers know (all two of you),  urlLink I didn't see the breast Sunday night .  I did hear Janet's new single on the radio today.  Unlike her Superbowl act, the song is utterly forgettable.  Pen at  urlLink Gutless Pacifist  (approvingly) quoted Howard Dean who said, in effect, "a breast is no big deal.  I've seen plenty of them in my doctor's office.  The FCC has bigger fish to fry than this."  I disagree on a couple of counts.  First, it's not true that a breast is a breast is a breast.  Context is everything.  A breast exam in Dr. Dean's office is not obscenity.   urlLink Manet's Olympia  is not obscenity.  Janet Jackson's bump and grind with Justin Timberlake is... obscenity?  The legal definition of obscenity is what's considered indecent by prevailing community standards, or something like that.  Right now the "community," or at least a sizeable portion of it, is up in arms about "the breast."  Remember that the American people own the airwaves, and they are leased to the TV networks.  The networks are obliged to be good stewards of this slice of the public domain; that means not putting obscene material on the air between 6:00 and 10:00 PM.  If, after the hue and cry about "the breast," the FCC did not investigate the incident, then they would not be discharging their fiduciary responsibility.  Of course it's about more than "the breast."  For many people the Superbowl halftime show was the straw that broke the camel's back.  Justin pawing Janet has become an icon of our increasingly debased culture.  That's why  urlLink complaints such as , "Well if a man can bear his breasts in public why can't a woman?"  miss the point.  Ironically  urlLink Congress was already pressuring the FCC  to tighten enforcement of obscenity regulations.  Janet and Justin's escapades have certainly given a boost to those efforts.  I hope they succeed.  Lastly, it's worth remembering that every TV viewer has his/her own personal censoring device.  It's called the Off Switch.  Even if the FCC's not doing it's job, and the people at CBS and MTV are hedonists, nobody's forcing you to watch.  After all, when you're on your death bed, is your biggest regret going to be that you didn't watch more TV?  Even if the language is squeeky clean and the breasts are all tucked in, there's a lot of better things to do than watch TV.

      Washington, Feb. 2 (Reuters)--In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court this morning declared the New England Patriots winners of Superbowl XXXVIII, and ordered the Vince Lombardi Trophy shipped to the Patriots' home in Foxboro, MA immediately.  The ruling brought closure to one of the most exciting football campaigns in American history, but raised new questions about the High Court's conservative judicial activism.  Reaction to the ruling was swift and varied.  Campaigning at a Civil War battle reinactment in Rock Hill, South Carolina, former Vermont Governor Howard Dean muttered, "I'm so mad I could scream.  These people are thieves and criminals.  I know how they operate, having lived behind enemy (that is, the Mason Dixon) lines for years.  They stole our country from us in 1865, and they've stolen our Superbowl this morning, but with Jesus' help, and a vote for me, we'll take back this country from Republican ideologues."  Massachusetts Senator John Kerry expressed pride in the performance of his home state football team, but seemed diffident about the court ruling.  "I'm glad the Lombardi trophy is coming back to Massachusetts," Kerry stated, "but if it looks like the Carolinas are in play by October, I'll try to take in a Panthers game with my old friends the Richardsons and denounce the Supreme Court ruling.  In short, I'll try to have it both ways, like my vote on the Iraq War."  The one sentence ruling, penned by Justice Antonin Scalia, gave no explanation for declaring the Patriots the champions.  Court watchers speculate that the five justices in the majority might have been trying to boost President Bush's re-election chances.  After New Hampshire went for President Bush in the 2000 election, Republican strategists thought that New England might be up for grabs in 2004.  But the recession, the jobless recovery, two Logan Airport flights destroying the World Trade Center Towers, and the Red Sox collapse in last year's ALCS have cast a pall on this region of charming villages and Revolutionary War history.  Some speculate that the ruling will give New Englanders something to cheer about, and they might unconsciously give credit to the incumbent President for happy days returning to the land of maple syrup and civil unions.

      No way I'm watching Janet Jackson's massive attempt at jury tampering.  Where was I?  Oh yes, basketball...  I want to hate Herb Sendek so bad I don't know what to do.  I want to quit my job and turn this blog into "Oust Herb Sentral."  My dream is that The Ivy Bush would be a Radio Free Europe in cyberspace, giving hope to Wolfpackers behind an iron curtain of mediocrity.  I want to scream bloody murder for Herb's head day after day after day until it's on a platter right beside my computer, that jaw motionless, the gum inside his mouth no longer being endlessly, nervously smacked.  And then... State plays a game like they did today.  They stuffed the Terps, just stuffed them down into the bottom of the garbage can.  First W in College Park in 14 years.  Julius was on fire.  Scoring, passing--the works.  The team was automatic from the free throw line.  And my hatred for Herb dissolves into something like a vague dissatisfaction.  We'll never get rid of him.  Never, ever.

       urlLink Poor Tom Friedman .  He's in the news business, but so much of the news is, you know, BAD news.  Every morning he gets up, turns on his computer, checks the headlines, and it's all downhill from there.    Tom wants a newsmaker to surprise him.  Show some imagination, George Bush!  Tom pleads.  Sign the Kyoto Protocol.  Show some imagination Palestinian mothers!  March on Hamas headquaters.  Demand that they stop recruiting their sons for suicide bombings.  The problem with the world today, says Mr. Tom, is that the terrorists have more imagination than the supposed good guys do.  Turning an airplane into a missile; now that's imagination!  Tom should have joined me at the Salisbury City Hall yesterday.  The Mayor hosted one of her regular Spirit Luncheons.  The theme is always improving race relations, a subject of great concern to the Mayor.  Yesterday's keynoter was  urlLink Tiffany Miller , the young black woman who got doused by water and called obscenities by five white teenagers at Wendys last summer.  The boys were arrested, and agreed to community service and diversity training.  When the youths went before the judge the last time, the judge singled out one of the five who hadn't performed his community service, but Miller intervened, forgiving the boy in court and interceding for him before the judge.  It was quite a dramatic moment for our little town.  Miller said that she did it because Jesus died for her sins 2,000 years ago, and gave her such a great example of how to live a life of compassion.  She said that she saw a young person who hadn't been properly trained, and her heart went out to him.  She forgave him, and invited him to worship with her at her church.  Tom should have eaten lunch with me yesterday, not only because he would have heard some good news, but because he would have learned a lesson about imagination.  Politicians are people with withered imaginations.  They live in the world of the real, not the world of the possible.  They thrive on conflict, not reconciliation.  They live for gaining tactical advantage in our systems of institutionalized self-interest and careful balance of power.  These are not people whom we should ever expect a surprise out of.  Tiffany Miller lives in the world of scripture and the life of Jesus.  It's an immeasurably wider world than the worlds of George W. Bush, Ariel Sharon and Antonin Scalia.  It's a world where Abraham and Ishmael come together to bury their Father Abraham.  It's a world where the crucified Christ prays for his tormentors.  It's a world where the Risen Christ says "Peace be with you" to the disciples who'd abandoned him in his hour of need.  It's a world of reconciliation.  Of course Tiffany Miller lives in the "real world" too, where racial prejudice is a reality.  But because she has dual citizenship in the kingdom of God, she can imagine the real world being a truly different world, and can live in the "real world" as though it had already been transformed.  And living "as though" is what makes for real surprises and real newness, Tom.

      I still haven't seen the movie.  But I did hear from Iwan Russell-Jones, the professor who taught my  urlLink "Jesus in Celluloid"  class.  Amazing how those search engines help you to reach out and touch someone!  Iwan loved The Passion.  You can read his review  urlLink here , at a web site called  urlLink Ship of Fools .  As far as I can tell it's an online version of The Door.  It's worth checking out, if for no other reason than the  urlLink Second Coming of Tim Lahaye is Thursday , and Ship of Fools is forecasting a  urlLink 60.8% chance of rapture .

      A couple of months ago  urlLink George Hunsinger  wrote an article for Christian Century about Iraq.  He showed what a mess we've gotten ourselves into, and how David Kay and Paul O'Neill's revelations cast doubt on the administration's case for war.  The article has been reprinted  urlLink here , at  urlLink antiwar.com .  Hunsinger, having summed up his case that the Iraq War was a war of aggression, not a just war, closed with a devastating quote by Robert Jackson, America's prosecutor at Nuremburg:  "Our position is that no grievances or policies will justify resort to aggressive war. It is utterly renounced and condemned as an instrument of policy."  The prowar crowd, who sees Iraq as their Munich moment, to quote  urlLink Josh Marshall , was sure not to take that lying down.  My new Christian Century contains a scathing response by  urlLink Jean Bethke Elshtain , as well as a rebuttal by Hunsinger.  It's not up yet on the  urlLink Christian Century's web site , so I'll summarize:  Elshtain quibbles with Hunsinger's interpretation of Kay and O'Neill's statements about WMD and the administration's designs on Iraq--quibbles to the point that I wonder if she can't see the forest for the trees.  Elshain also denies that a just war needs U.N. authorization, and on this point I wonder if she's not right.  Just War criteria include "legitimate authority."  Is that Congress?  The U.N.?  NATO?  The conclusion is rather strange.  Hunsinger's article was titled "The Fog of War."  Elshtain charges that Hunsinger misuses this expression.  It was originally meant to to say that wars are "always undertaken and carried out in ways that are not crystal clear... Surely it is far, far better for policy-makers and military leaders to remain constantly aware of the fog of war in order that they not overpredict what they can do."  I say strange because she seems to be making the case AGAINST pre-emptive war.  How could we have been so certain that war with Iraq in March, 2003 was the only real option to deal with Iraq?  There was a new, vigorous inspection regime in place.  Moreover, there were serious questions about our ability to manage this large, ethnically diverse country after the war was won.  Those questions seem to have been borne out by the chaos we're witnessing a year later.  Elshtain addresses the concept of preemptive war with this remarkable statement:   I don't understand how any person of decency can claim in good conscience that an invasion of Iraq... was wholly unprovoked.  John Gaddis... points out that some version of... preemptive use of force has been part of U.S. policy since the days of John Quincy Adams... Hunsinger seems shocked, shocked that gambling is going on in Casablanca.  Surely we should all be a bit more worldly than that!  This doesn't mean we should rush to support any particular instance of intervention.  But to pretend that this is something brand new does violence to political history and widely distorts known facts.   It's hard not to get angry at this paragraph.  I'm used to pagans, immature Christians and other hacks faulting the preacher or theologian for not living in "the real world" when he/she proclaims a hard truth of Christianity (such as, war is evil; the rich won't fare well at the judgment; God hates divorce).  But someone like Elshtain ought to know better.  I think that the capacity to be shocked, whether its by Janet Jackson's breast, or by a government that leads its nation into a quagmire based on hubris and lies, is essential to living a Christian life.  Elshtain's an ethicist, right?  Not much of one, I'd have to say, based on this article.  True, America has hauled off and started wars from time to time.  However, the doctrine of preemption, enshrined in the president's National Security Directive of September, 2002, does represent a major shift in policy, away from the 50-year-old policy of deterrence.  Ask Richard Perle.  He'll tell you how revolutionary it is.  And even if the United States has a long history of starting wars, that part of our history is something that American Christians ought to stand against.    Elshtain, desperate to retain a seat at the  realpolitik  table, has abandoned the best in scripture and theological reflection on just war.  If this is what "worldly Christianity" looks like, them I'm happy to remain a Christian country bumpkin.

      Let me say first of all, I'll vote for anyone to be president other than George Bush.  Since Kerry has the best shot of beating Bush, he's certainly got my vote in November.  But  urlLink this story  really bothered me.  Using Scripture as a political campaign attack weapon - there's just something not right about that.  There's plenty of sin in the Democrats and the Republicans, so we don't need any self-righteous finger-pointing.  Please, Kerry, don't use Scripture in this way again.  Now if Mother Teresa had wanted to use Scripture to criticize Bush, that would have been fine.  Even Jimmy Carter has the moral authority to do that.  But Kerry doesn't.  It just doesn't fit.  Other problems with this story: Kerry SHOULD let the Pope tell him what to do.  Kerry perpetuates the private/public split about which I have written before.  Of course, Bush also perpetuates the unfortunate split, and he should allow his Methodist bishops to tell him what to do.  And I can't help but mention one other thing:  urlLink Duke  goes once again to the Final Four for the tenth time in Coach K's tenure.  Duke University: home of  urlLink good theology  and  urlLink great basketball .  Now Marvin told me I had to mention Duke football every time I mentioned Duke basketball.  So here goes:  In case you have forgotten, Duke did beat UNC this year in  urlLink football !

      It's a good rule of thumb:  when the facts are on your side, stick with the facts.  Hammer them home.  When the facts are not on your side, resort to the  ad hominem  attack.  Now read  urlLink this column  by attack dog Charles Krauthammer and ask yourself, Who's got the facts on their side?  Krauthammer asks, "If Bush's approach to terrorism were so incompetent, why didn't Richard Clarke resign?"  The implication is that since Clarke didn't resign, things couldn't have been that bad.    This ignores a host of reasons why Clarke might have stayed as long as he did at the White House.  For one thing, he was employed there since the Reagan administration.  Career civil servants don't up and quit the first time their politically appointed superiors refuse to take their advice.  If that were the case, the turnover in the executive branch would be phenomenal.  Krauthammer misrepresents Clarke as a cheerleader for the Clinton administration and a Bush-hater.  In fact, Clarke faults Clinton's lack of sexual continence for so wounding him politically that he was unable to muster the requisite support for a more aggressive posture toward Al Qaeda.  Clarke himself told the 9/11 commission that terrorism was "an important priority for the Bush administration but not an urgent priority."  Clarke's testimony strikes me as nuanced, befitting a career civil servant.  He does not come across as out for revenge, as Krauthammer says when he accuses him of resenting Condi Rice for demoting him.   Ad hominem ad nauseam .  More telling that Kruathammer's unsubstantiated speculations about Clarke's motives are the facts that he fails to address.  Clarke charges that there were no links between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein, that the President tried to get him to find some links anyway, and that the administration shoe-horned a war on Iraq into national fear and outrage over the 9/11 attacks.  CBS has multiple sources in the White House that can confirm the conversation the President had with Clarke on 9/12/2001.  All Krauthammer can do in the face of such, shall we say, embarrassing facts, is go into reflex mode:   It was Clinton's fault!   Yes, Dear Reader, everything's always Clinton's fault.  Forever and ever.  Halleluah.  Amen.  Again, if the facts are on your side, you stick to the facts.  If the facts aren't on your side, then you question motives, assassinate character, and launch  ad hominem  attacks.  Read the Krauthammer piece and decide for yourself, Who's got the facts on their side?

      I grow weary of fact-checking the President, but I trudge along, Dear Reader, out of service to you and your unquenchable thirst for the truth.  Consider this statement that he made while campaigning in New Hampshire yesterday (courtesy of  urlLink this report  by the Chicago Tribune's Michael Kilian):  "I saw a threat, Congress saw a threat, the United Nations Security Council saw a threat in the form of Saddam Hussein.  He was not only a threat to the people in the Middle East because of terrorist ties, he was a threat to America or anybody else who loves freedom."  Saddam Hussein was a minor threat to Middle Eastern people.  He paid bounties to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers.  But given the no-fly zone and a decade of punishing sanctions, he was incapable of threatening his neighbors in the way that he did with his ill-advised wars against Iran and Kuwait.  At any rate, Israel was perfectly capable of defending itself from Saddam or anyone.  Was he a threat to the United States?  Bush had to reiterate this charge to combat the damaging testimony this week of Richard Clarke, Bush's former counter-terrorism chief.  Clarke alleged that the invasion of Iraq was a foolish and costly detour away from prosecuting the war on terrorism.    Bush's charge, while familiar, is wholly unsubstantiated.  Where are the terrorist training camps Saddam was running in Iraq?  Where is the testimony of former regime officials confirming a link between Al Qaeda and Saddam?  Where is the archival evidence proving cooperation between the erstwhile Iraqi dictator and Islamic radicals?    Colin Powell once pointed to the radical group Ansar al Islam operating within the borders of Iraq prior to the war as proof of an Al Qaeda/Saddam alliance.  But Ansar al Islam is a Kurdish group--sworn enemies of Saddam.  Moreover, they had set up shop in the no-fly zone.  Alleging that there were links between Saddam and Al Qaeda is as laughable as asserting that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq just prior to the war.  The only reason why everyone's not laughing out loud is that somebody like David Kay has yet to stand up and state the obvious.    Richard Clarke is the closest we have, and just look at the ruthlessness with which the administration has gone after him.  (Although they really ought to get their stories straight.  Was Clarke "out of the loop" as Dick Cheney told Rush Limbaugh?  Or was there at every meeting, as Condi Rice states?)  The furiousness and incoherence of the administration's response to Clarke, a career civil servant who also worked for George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, demonstrates that Clarke's hit a nerve.  Meanwhile,  urlLink another forty Americans have been killed  in Iraq just this month, the Shiites have withdrawn their endorsement of the new Iraqi Constitution, and "liberated" Iraqi women find themselves  urlLink compelled to wear head scarves  by gangs of angry men.  Operation Iraqi Freedom, fully justifiable, we are told, proceeds full speed ahead, we are assured.  There's none so blind as he who refuses to see.

      When people object to Christian truth claims because there's no "proof" for them, I usually say something like this:  It is a mistake to try to look for empirical proof of Christianity.  Christian truth is a different animal.  It cannot be discovered by the tools and strategies of the modern scientific method.  One must use more appropriate tools--namely faith, and a "good faith" engagement with the means of grace, the word of God, the sacraments of the church, and the fellowship and discipline of the Christian community.  To ask for something repeatable, verifiable and observable that "proves" Christianity makes no more sense than studing galaxies with a microscope rather than a telescope.  You're using the wrong instruments.  While reading  urlLink Gary Dorien's  biography of Karl Barth,  urlLink Theology without Weapons:  The Barthian Revolt in Modern Theology , I found a word for this line of reasoning:  neo-Kantian.  Dorrien begins by reviewing the theology of Barth's teacher Wilhelm Herrmann.  Herrmann, reacting to Troeltsch's determination to study the development of Christianity as neutrally and objectively as one might study any religion, argued that one could not ground Christian truth claims in historical evidence about Jesus or early Christianity.  Rather, the individual's personal encounter with God through participating in the inner life of Jesus is the only ground for the truthfulness of Christianity.    Herrmann then, is a neo-Kantian to the extent that he follows Kant's differentiations between the kinds of knowledge that can be attained through various disciplines.  Since philosophy and science have no access to the divine, theology must not look for support from these disciplines.  When Barth went on to affirm that Jesus Christ, the Word of God, is a self-authenticating event that is not subject to critical scrutiny from any other moral, intellectual, scientific or religious high ground, you can hear the voice of Herrmann.  Of course Barth went on to scrap a good bit of Herrmann's theology, namely by making the "objective" event of the Word of God normative for Christian truth rather than any individual's "subjective" experience of that Word.  OK, so I'm a neo-Kantian.  But is that a good thing?  My argument that Christian truth can only be probed by faith can be easily dismissed as "fideism," using faith to establish faith.  It's a tautology.  Moreover, by refusing to bring Christian truth claims into dialogue and debate with secular ideologies and other religions, it can be dismissed as a failure of nerve on my part.  I'm simply not willing to subject my faith to critical scrutiny, right?  On the other hand, one could say that any attempt to ground Christian truth in something other than the gospel, say, what science teaches us about the cosmos, or what history teaches us about the historical Jesus, is also a failure of nerve.  Such an approach betrays the belief that the gospel can't stand on its own two feet, but needs a crutch, history, philosophy, science, reason, whatever.  Perhaps our problems with evangelism have to do with a certain methodological confusion over how to establish and commend "the truth of Christianity."   urlLink Uncle George , if you're reading this, please figure out how to use the comment button and straighten us out!

      Who cares if an atheist calls the  urlLink Pledge unconstitutional ?  What is more interesting is that Christians should call it unbiblical!  That's right, unbiblical!  The pledge of allegiance, as it is currently understood by most Americans, is unbiblical.  For starters: Let's take the first three of the ten commandments:  "You shall have no other gods before me.  (Exo 20:3 NIV)  "You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.  (Exo 20:4 NIV)  You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,  (Exo 20:5 NIV)  but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.  (Exo 20:6 NIV)  "You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.  (Exo 20:7 NIV)   But wait a minute, some may ask.  Isn't it a good thing to keep this nation "under God." ?  Not really, as those terms are currently understood.  When the word "God" is used in the pledge of allegiance, it is not the Christian Triune God that is being invoked.  It is the god of the Enlightenment, Deism, the harmless god of Euro-American philosophy and civil religion.  It has very little in common with the jealous, dangerous, and holy God of the Bible.  It is an un-Christian, anti-Christian god that is being invoked.  Why Christians would want to invoke such a god is beyond me.  The sooner that god dies, the better.  I've heard so many people say, "oh, the god being referred to is not a sectarian god, just the highest being that is shared in common by all the world's great religions and by the highest aspirations of all people."  Such a god is a boring god, an idol.  If God cannot be understood specifically as the God of Abraham and Sarah, of Sinaii and Exile, of cross and resurrection, then I am not particularly interested in him/her/it.  I do not want this nation to be under some vague abstract god.  Yet that is exactly the kind of god that is being defended in the supreme court.  Ah, but if we don't teach children about God, even the specifically Christian God, in school, some of them will never hear about God.  That is true.  But that is the church's problem, not the public schools.  That is an indication that we have given up on the task of evangelism as a church, and we are so lazy, that we are asking the school to do for the church what the church can only do for itself: evangelize.  Yes, that's right, I said it: The church is to EVANGELIZE.  This is where this Evangelical, orthodox, pacifist, socialist, sacramentalist, sanctificationist gets it all going together.  Marvin is sure to regret the day he ever invited me to join this blog.  The  urlLink Circuit Rider  has a review of Scott Jones's new book on evangelism: Evangelistic Love.  I've orderd it and can't wait to read it.  Let's face it: we main-liners just don't know what to do about the e word.  It seems so out-of-date, yet we still want to pay lip service to it somehow.  I frankly have no idea how we should be going about the task of evangelism, so this new book had better be good!  I just know we shouldn't dump off the task of evangelism on the public schools.    Now I love the public schools.  They do a great job of teaching math, science, languages, music, and many other things.  But I don't want them teaching theology.  They'd make a mess out of that.

      The Bible is so--relevant.  Consider these words from Psalm 5, which the daily lectionary serves up every Wednesday in Lent:   For there is no truth in their mouths;      their hearts are destruction; their throats are open graves;      they flatter with their tongues. Make them bear their guilt, O God;      let them fall by their own counsels; because of their many transgressions cast them out,      for they have rebelled against you.   The Word of the Lord.  Thanks be to God.

      Supreme Court Justice  urlLink Antonin Scalia   has stated publicly that he believes Catholics who accept their church's teachings against capital punishment should not be judges.  The argument is a familiar one: justice has to do with the public and political realm.  Religion should be kept in the private sphere.  Keep your religious views to yourself, don’t let them get in the way of your public duties.  Our public duties should be based on something “objective,” whereas religious views are “subjective.”   Nothing is more deadly to the witness of the Christian church than this private/public split.  This split is the secularist’s way of keeping religion “in its place.”  It’s time for the religious world to put the state in its place.  I, for one, think that anyone who favors capital punishment should not be allowed to serve as a judge.  Being in favor of the death penalty is a terrible bias which prevents a judge from administering justice.  You see, the Christian faith shows us the way the world really is.  Anyone who does not operate from a Christian perspective, is not operating in the real world.  The Catholic Church is a much more universal, inclusive organization than any other political organization, including that tiny, sectarian, organization called the U.S. Supreme Court.   The Catholic Church brings together people from every nation, every tongue, every tribe, every race from all over the face of the earth.  In comparison, the U.S. Supreme Court draws on a very small segment of the world’s population (educated affluent westerners) and  is very narrow, operating out of the story of the European Enlightenment, which represents a very particular view of the world.  The difference between Christian judges and agnostic judges is not that the former is biased and that the latter is objective.  The difference is in the way they are both biased.  A Christian judge is biased in favor of Jesus Christ who is the way, the truth, and the life.    An agnostic judge is biased according to the assumptions of modernity.  The question is not which one is biased and which is objective.  The question is, which bias is more in keeping with the Truth?  Think about it: which one do we have more to fear from?  Which one of these two political organizations has asked its adherents to kill for it in the past 50 years?  The Catholic Church or the U.S. government?  How many people have killed out of their devotion to the Catholic Church in the past 50 years?  How many people have killed because of their allegiance to the U.S. government?  Although I am a Protestant and have some theological differences with my Catholic brothers and sisters, I admire the universality of the Catholic Church.  It is truly the most inclusive of all political organizations.  I cannot imagine a better community from which to draw wisdom for the administration of justice than the Catholic Church.  What Justice Scalia assumes is that the church is “narrow” and the world is “wide.”  In reality the church is wide because it acknowledges the Lordship of Jesus Christ, and the world is narrow because it does not.  When Al Gore named Joseph Liebermann as his vp candidate, Rev. David Hockett wrote that the real question was not whether Joseph Liebermann could be a good vice president in spite of his Judaism, but whether being vice president would interfere with the more important task of being a faithful Jew.  In a similar way, I am arguing that the most important question is not whether a judge’s Catholic views hinder his or her ability to be a judge, but whether a judge’s responsibilities as a judge will interfere with his or her ability to be a faithful Catholic.  Asking these kinds of questions is how we keep the state in its place.  Moreover, these questions should not only be put to vice-presidents and judges, but to all of us concerning every part of our lives.

      Don't like all the criticism of the President?  All you have to do is label the critic a "Bush hater."  No matter how damning the evidence, how logical the argument, how unimpeachable the character of the critic, the Bush hater label makes their statements disappear in a puff of hot air.  The list of Bush haters grows longer and longer.  And it's not all the usual suspects.  The funny thing is, it includes a number of high ranking former employees of the President.  It started with John DiIulio, Bush's Faith Based Initiative Bishop.  He labeled the administration a bunch of "Mayberry Machiavellis," hacks who cared nothing about sound policy, only about scoring political points.  But the Bush people worked him over enough to get him to issue a full apology.  Then there's that insufferable Marxist, former head of Alcoa and former Secretary of the Treasury Paul O'Neill.  Bush fired O'Neill for opposing the second round of welfare for the rich.  O'Neill reports a lack of intellectual curiosity on the President's part, and a tendency of Bush's aides to establish the outcome of a policy meeting before the meeting started.  Oh, and by the way, Bush asked for a plan to invade Iraq a week after moving in the White House.  So much for the invasion of Iraq having anything to do with the war on terror.  (You can't say that!  BUSH HATER!)  The Bush people immediately launched an investigation into O'Neill's book.  The good folks at the Army War College studied the Iraq War.  They came to the conclusion that it was a strategic blunder, dangerously overextending the U.S. military.  So typical.  They were coddling Communists in the days of Joe MacCarthy, and today they're BUSH HATERS!  Now comes that Clarke guy, Bush's former head of counter-terrorism.  (Of course he worked for Clinton too, which thoroughly discredits him--BUSH HATER!!  The fact that he worked for Presidents for 30 years is meaningless!!!)  Anyway, Clarke writes that he begged for meetings on Al Qaeda in the spring and summer of 2001 with senior national security staff, and got stiffed.  Everyone was focused on Iraq.  It was as if they walked in the White House with the same list of concerns that they walked out with in January 1993.    Finally, 9/11 happened.  On 9/12 Clarke reports that Donald Rumsfeld recommended bombing Iraq instead of Afghanistan, where the 9/11 masterminds were headquartered, because Iraq had better targets.  I know that since I'm a pacifist I don't know anything about the real world, but you warmongers out there are going to have to explain to me how Rummy's sortie priorities made any sense at all on 9/12/01.  Clarke also reports that Bush bullied him about coming up with any shred of evidence linking the 9/11 attacks to Saddam Hussein.  Go to  urlLink Talking Points Memo  to see how Dick Cheney is already out there lying on Rush Limbaugh's show about Mr. Clarke.  What we have is an administration that doesn't want to be bothered by the facts.  An administration that bombs the wrong country, ignores real threats because of a Captain Ahab-like obsession with guppy-sized despots, and establishes legislative priorities based on a moistened finger lifted to the flatulent wind blowing from its base.  If it were anybody else, you'd be marching on Washington, but since it's THIS administration, that just makes the critics a bunch of BUSH HATERS.    President Bush needs to stop hiring people who hate him so much.

      Here's a question: What if United Methodists, currently pre-occupied with the  urlLink Karen Dammann trial , were so busy helping the poor, feeding the hungry, embodying peace, providing alternatives to abortion, working for reconciliation between the races, resisting war and doing so many other Jesus things, that we didn't have time to argue over homosexuality?  HOw wonderful that would be!  In a way, arguing over homosexuality is something Americans do when they are rich and bored.    Having said that, it does bother me than an annual conference body has decided that the  Discipline  does not apply to them.   urlLink It's a bad precedent.  This is how Dr. Stephen Long (one of my professors at Duke)    responded to a similar situation last year when the Northern Illinois Conference ignored the  Discipline .    Two hundred years ago, the SC annual conference (my home conference) decided that the  Discipline  didn't apply to  them .  It didn't turn out well.  -Jonathan

      It didn't turn out quite like I expected.  Worship was great, very inspirational.  Sarah put together an orchestra ensemble of children and youth that served up rousing versions of Wonderful Words of Life and Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee.  I must brag on the junior members of my congregation.  There's not a one that doesn't play a musical instrument.  But I didn't get to see The Passion.  Seth had to cancel, and I'm always tired after worship, and it was easy to convince myself that I hadn't enough energy to watch Jesus beaten to a pulp.  Instead I watched State get--not exactly beaten to a pulp--just beaten by a determined Vanderbilt team.  You're up 12 with two minutes to play; your star player fouls out, and then what?  Of course you foul two three-point shooters, giving away six points at the stripe, and homeboy Marcus Melvin adds an intentionally foul.  This is so typical.  The team really knows how to choke.  But the sportswriters took away my right to hate Herb when they anointed him Coach of the Year.  Fume...  We sat outside for a while and read while the kids rode bikes.  But soon enough we retreated indoors.  A cold front's a blowing through.  It sure don't FEEL like the vernal equinox out there!  But it looks so dang good.  The bulbs are up.  The grass is green.  the maples have that red fuzz all over them.  It's Spring, even if it doesn't feel like it.  Whooppee!

      Those of you who heaped such scorn on the allegations that Guantanamo Bay detainees were sexually humiliated will certainly find the following accusations more credible.   urlLink Knight Ridder reports  that the military has charged six American soldiers stationed at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq with indeceny and assault.  Some highlights from the article:   The military's manual for courts martial says that "'indecent' signifies that form of immorality relating to sexual impurity which is not only grossly vulgar, obscene, and repugnant to common propriety, but tends to excite lust and deprave the morals with respect to sexual relations."   Conviction on that charge can carry a maximum of five years in prison.   Although the charges suggest something sexual in nature, The Uniformed Code of Military Justice has specific articles alleging rape and sodomy, and they were not among the five UCMJ violations filed against the MPs Saturday.    "Something sexual in nature..."  Say, like slinging menstrual blood at Iraqi detainees?  Who knows?  The possibilities are endless.  We can take heart that these charges are the result of an investigation ordered by Lt. Gen. Richardo Sanchez on January 14.  An investigation of the former Guantanamo Bay prisoners' allegations would seem to be prudent, if for no other reason than to exonerate the Camp X-Ray guards.  At any rate, Christian Peacemaker Team's  urlLink invitation to fast for the Iraqi detainees  in the spirit of Isaiah 58 stands.  Since those who have been so contemptuous of the Camp X-Ray allegations are professing Christians, taking up CPT on their offer, especially in light of these latest charges, would seem to be in order.

      Last week's  urlLink violence in Kosovo  is bad news for reconstruction efforts in Iraq.  Compared to Iraq, the Kosovo War was the gold standard for a humanitarian intervention.  While not sanctioned by the U.N., the war was prosecuted by NATO, an international organization which unites the security interests of North America and Europe.  Unlike Iraq, there was an imminent threat.  We could all see Serbian tanks and troops moving into position to murder the Albanians.  When ground troops went into Kosovo, they did so with overwhelming force relative to the size and population of the region, unlike Iraq, which was a war fought on the cheap.  And yet, five years after the war, NATO troops are still there, and the region is still convulsed by ethnic and religious violence.  How deluded are we to we believe that peace is just around the corner for the larger, more ethnically diverse and more violent Iraq?  Wait and see what impact capturing bin Laden will have in Iraqi peace--nil.  After the euphoria wears off, the violence will likely continue, perhaps putting the last nail in the coffin for the theory that a war on Iraq is part of a war on terrorism.  I don't see how the election of John Kerry will change things much.  By all means, vote out the current administration for getting us into this quandry, but Kerry isn't a magician.  It's Sunday.  Let us remember the psalmist, who said, "Put not your trust in princes, in mortals in whom there is no help.  Happy are those whose trust is the Lord."  With God all things are possible.  Even peace in the Middle East.

      There's more than enough Iraq War retrospectives in the media this week.  I would simply commend to you this paragraph from a  urlLink Commonweal article  on how preemptive war comports with Catholic teaching on "just war":   (Theologian Hugo) Grotius conceded that the specter of a future attack might legitimate a preemptive action if it could be shown that the danger was immediate and certain. Still, he also insisted that “fear of an uncertainty cannot confer the right to resort to force.” Using armed force preventively, solely to eliminate an adversary’s ability to inflict future harm, he deemed illicit. It would punish crimes not yet committed, perhaps not even planned, and would make fear a principle of action in international relations, thereby opening a Pandora’s box of anticipatory first strikes. “That the possibility of being attacked confers the right to attack is abhorrent to every principle of equity,” he wrote. “Human life exists under such conditions that complete security is never guaranteed to us.”

      Jonathan Marlowe, a friend and colleague, is now a guest columnist for The Ivy Bush.  Jonathan is the pastor of  urlLink Shiloh United Methodist Church  in nearby Granite Quarry, North Carolina.  Below is his first entry, although we hope that soon enough Jonathan has direct access to the blog, so that he can post directly rather than emailing me his rants and raves.  Jonathan, one rule to abide by:  for every commentary on Duke basketball, you have to also comment on Duke football.  Now, have at it:  I feel so honored.  I am a guest-writer for the Ivy Bush.  Wow.  How many people actually read this?  An acquaintance of mine, Jason Byasse has  urlLink written a review  of the Purpose Driven Books by Rick Warren for the Christian Century.  Like Jason, I have a mixed reaction to the whole Rick Warren Purpose Driven movement.  At first, I was very skeptical.  I thought it was another fad, like the Left Behind series, or the Prayer of Jabez.  I knew that those books had shaky theological foundations, so I figured that the Purpose Driven stuff also rang hollow.  Besides, it came from a seeker-sensitive mega-church, and I am very suspicious of anything at all related to those kinds of churches.  I was therefore surprised when I read the Purpose Driven Life to discover that Rick Warren actually has some interesting theological points.  He has an annoying habit of saying, “The Bible says….” and then quoting from some paraphrase.  He also over-simplifies some rather complex doctrines like God’s sovereignty, predestination, and foreknowledge.   But other than these two basic weaknesses, I like The Purpose Driven Life.  Believe it or not, he draws on a wide range of Christian sources, including Wesley, Bonhoeffer, Luther, Mother Teresa, John of the Cross, C.S. Lewis, Henri Nouwen, E. Stanley Jones, and Brother Lawrence.  We don’t usually find Southern Baptists who will quote Roman Catholics as sources of authority.  I had to respect him for that.  In the Purpose Driven Life, he reflects a high ecclesiology and doctrine of sanctification.  He reminds us that worship is for God, and not for human beings.  He warns us that many so called “praise-choruses” are not appropriate for worship because they focus on people’s feelings instead of God.  He insists that growth in the Christian life can only come in the fellowship of the church.  He is even mostly on target when he talks about baptism.  On the other hand, his book the Purpose Driven Church has some major problems, despite its good points.  These are brought out well by Jason Byasse in his Christian Century article.  The problem with Jason’s article, is that it is written as if it were about both books, but the shortcomings that he points out are entirely from The Purpose Driven Church and not from The Purpose Driven Life.  I think the Purpose Driven Life book is helpful, whereas the Purpose Driven Church book is more of a mixed bag.  Unfortunately, Jason lumped them both together.  I think he was pushed to do this by The Christian Century because they wanted to cover The Purpose Driven Life since it was the big seller.

       urlLink Buck  is also skeptical about all the new worry over Al Qaeda's potential influence on U.S. elections.  He points out that the IRA and Hamas have been trying to bomb rather than vote in elections for years now.  Hamas is a particularly noteworthy example.  In Israel, bombings and elections go together like peanut butter and jelly.    But there's one key difference between the Spanish and Israeli situations.  Unlike the Madrid bombings, which were reportedly intended to punish the hawkish government of Prime Minister Anzar, Hamas operations mean to punish Israeli doves.    Why?  Palestinian radicals don't want peace.  Unlike ordinary Palestinians, who have accepted the reality of the Jewish state and just want the Israelis out of their hair on the best terms possible, Hamas wants to continue the fight until either they drive the Jews into the sea or until they're buried in a pile of rubble (the far more likely outcome).  So they dispatch their suicide bombers on the eve of an election or high level talks between Israeli and Palestinian officials.  The result is entirely predictable.  Outraged Israelis vote for Likud, and peace talks get called off.  The war grinds on.  The point:  the Israeli electorate allows itself to be jerked around by terrorists just as much as the Spanish electorate.  But I don't recall any hand-wringing by  urlLink David Brooks  or  urlLink Andrew Sullivan  over dumb Israeli voters who keep handing terrorists victory after victory.  Let's bring it back to this side of the Atlantic.  Suppose an Al Qaeda bombing is our October surprise.  What are they up to?  Are they trying to undermine voter confidence in the Bush administration and get John "the Appeaser" Kerry elected?  Then I should vote for Bush, right?  Or are they trying to turn moderate U.S. voters into hawks, thus re-electing George Bush and guaranteeing more rash invasions, and more opportunities to kill the soldiers of the Great Satan?  Then I should vote for Kerry, right?  My head is starting to hurt.  It's hard playing reverse psychology with a terrorist.

      AP reporter Terence Hunt has written  urlLink a propaganda piece  for the Bush-Cheney election team cleverly disguised as an objective news story.  Noting that the Madrid bombings were a key factor in Sunday's upset win by the Socialists, the piece asks, "Could it happen here?"  Hunt quotes political psychologist Stanley Renshon of City University of New York, who stated, "The implications of this are fairly staggering.  This is the first time that a terrorist act has influenced a democratic election. This is a gigantic, loud wakeup call. There's no one they'd like to have out of office more than George W. Bush."  Terrorism influencing elections?  Horrors!  But if that's such a bad thing, then what are those images of ground zero doing in the President's re-election ads?  Here's a quote from a  urlLink New York Times article --White House press secretary Scott McClellan responding to criticism that the President was politicizing the national tragedy of 9/11:   Scott McClellan... (said) that the terrorist attacks continued to be an important object lesson in the need for strong national security.  "It is vital to our future that we learn what September 11th taught us," he said. "The president's steady leadership is vital to how we wage the war on terrorism."   In fact, terrorism influencing elections is a GOOD thing, so long as it boosts the electability of the Bush administration and its handful of allies around the world.  Hunt's AP article does entertain the possibility that the electorate could learn the "wrong" lesson from a terrorist attack on U.S. soil prior to the November elections, that is blaming the party in power for failing to protect them.  But Hunt's piece tends to downplay the possibility.    I don't think AP has an ombudsman, but why don't you call them at 212-621-1500 and complain anyway?  Correction:  In an earlier version of this post I wrongly stated that Hunt mentions President Kennedy's increased popularity after the Bay of pigs fiasco as an example of the people rallying around the President in times of crisis.  In fact it was George Will's column in today's Observer that uses the Big of Pigs example.  That's what I get for blogging from memory.

      So we're down to two, right?  Tony Blair and Ahmad Chalabi?  Oh, I forgot the Poles.  There's no telling what the fallout will be now that the new Spanish Prime Minister has  urlLink ordered his conquistadores to redeploy to the homeland .  French obstinacy in the runup to last year's war led to the re-christening of French Fries as Freedom Fries.  We can expect similar retribution aimed at the Spaniards.  Antonio Banderas' Hollywood career is probably sunk.  I also anticipate the President endorsing yet another Constitutional amendment.  The latest will ban any government entity from observing Columbus Day.  (A stroke of triangulation genius, that one.  Die hard nationalists and the PC crowd on the far left will both cheer that proposal).  The incumbents might have held on to power had they not played the bombings in such a transparently political way.  Instead of sticking to their ETA story in the face of so much evidence to the contrary, the government should have professed agnosticism and determination ("We don't know who did it, but we'll find out and punish them.")  Even that might not have been enough to win the election.  Spanish citizens overwhelmingly opposed the war on Iraq that their government endorsed.  "Our dead your war" is a powerful campaign slogan.

      President Bush addressed evangelical leaders Thursday, vowing to defend the institution of marriage from activist judges.  I couldn't disagree more with his analysis of the situation.  The judges aren't creating social change; they're merely responding to it.  "Activist judges" didn't force Fortune 500 companies like RJR/Nabisco, headquartered in the most crimson-shaded region of red state North Carolina, to offer domestic partner benefits to same sex couples.  "Activist judges" didn't order Vermont's state assembly to write a civil unions law.  (In the case of Vermont, just who is the President going to protect the people's marriages from--the people themselves?)  Flogging gay marriage is also bad politics for President Bush.  If your key issues are abortion, homosexuality, the second amendment, smut on TV, and other social issues that conservatives care deeply about, then you will vote for Bush in the fall, no doubt about it.  There's no Ralph Nader on Bush's right wing to seduce you.  Bush really needs to shore up his support among the fiscally conservative, socially moderate to conservative folks--the Chamber of Commerce crowd.  I'm hearing people like this saying the unthinkable, things like, "I'm so fed up with this administration I'm going to have to pull the Democratic lever next fall."  They're mad about the deficit.  They're disgusted with the crony capitalism in the energy bill.  They hate the complexity and the price tag of the Medicare Prescription drug benefit.  As to the latter, Friday's revelation that Medicare's chief actuary was  urlLink forced to lie about the cost of the prescription drug bill  won't improve their disposition toward the administration.  One wonders--if H.R. Clinton had forced executive branch number crunchers to lie about the cost of the Clinton health plan, how long would it have taken Republicans in Congress to scream, "Independent Counsel!"  The recklessness and the dishonesty is breathtaking.  Some people are starting to catch on...

      Last night, Ciniath, a third level barbarian, wrought havoc when his merry band of adventurers accidently stumbled upon a squad of orcs when they opened a secret door in an abandoned Dwarven mine.  Nessa, an Elven ranger, pocketed a dagger with a mithril handle.  We rest until Thursday.  (Ciniath was the name of a Pictish king.  The Picts were the original inhabitants of Scotland, tatooed, swarthy men and women whom the Romans never subdued.  Nessa is Laura in Elven, according to the  urlLink translator ).  I know, I know.  It's all fun and games, but before you know it, you're  urlLink exploring the steam tunnels underneath the campus and killing your relatives .  (Do click on the link.  I took econ with that guy.  But I didn't play D&D with him).

      The Prime Minister of South Korea was impeached today.  Or was it yesterday--South Korea being on the other side of the world?  At any rate, the impeachment took place only after lawmakers in the PM's party stormed the speaker's chair in an ultimately futile bid to thwart the vote.  I'm not kidding.  Ethan and I watched this on The News Hour tonight.  "What are they doing, Daddy?"  he asked.  I think I said something about how humanity has evolved, shedding mob rule for democray and a social contract.  That's the last time I let him watch the news with me.  Anyway, I wonder if the Democrats shouldn't have done the same back in 1998.  I think that Gephardt would take Newt on his superior reach alone.  No wait.  Dennis Hastert was the Speaker by the time the vote was taken.  Now that's interesting.  Ol' Denny was a wrestling coach before he turned to politics.  Alas, like a lot of coaches, Denny has let himself go in his old age.  Still, if he could get the minority leader on his back, then, as is the case with all heavyweight matches, it'd be over quick.  A brawl in the House of Representatives could have revealed how Butch or Fem Barney Frank really is.  Cynthia McKinney was crazy, but just because you're crazy doesn't mean yo can fight.  I think Sue Myrick would have handled her, or even Nancy Pelosi, just fine.  But all I can say is, watch out for Maxine Waters.  Meow!

      When you ask Christians, "How does Jesus make a difference in my relationship with God?" many will say something like this:   God is a righteous judge whose honor is offended when human beings break his law.  God demands that satisfaction be made, but no human being can make satisfaction for sin because we sin more and more every day.  So God solves this problem by becoming a human being in Christ.  Christ's sinless death on the cross pays the debt we owe to God as a result of our sin.  Thus Christ puts us back in the black with God, so to speak.   This answer, or variations on it, is on display (so I hear) in the movie The Passion.  Mel Gibson's exceedingly gory portrayal of the death of Jesus may be intended to drive home just how much we have sinned, since it required so much agony on Christ's part to pay the debt.  This answer, so common among both Roman Catholic and Protestant Christians, was not always universally accepted.  It was only in the 11th century that Anselm of Canterbury developed this theory about how Jesus reconciles us to God.  For the first 1,000 years of Christianity, Christians thought about Jesus' atoning, reconciling work in other ways, ways that, oddly enough, have more to do with the ACC Tournament than with The Passion.  Irenaeus was a bishop in Lyon in the second century.  Irenaeus saw Christ's reconciling work as the decisive battle in a war between God and Satan.  Christ comes into the world to take the war against evil onto its home turf.  Jesus heals the sick, casts out demons, and says No to the temptations of the devil.  When Jesus is crucified, it appears as though Satan has won, but on Easter Sunday, Jesus rose from the dead, blowing open the gates of hell, defeating the powers of sin and death.  Christians appropriate this victory over sin and death for themselves through baptism, faith in Christ, and membership in his body, the church.  Irenaeus' theology of atonement, called  Christus Victor  (Latin for Christ the victor), held sway for the first millenium of church history, and is still popular among Orthodox Christians.  Among Protestants Martin Luther and John Wesley had an affinity for it.  How is this like the ACC tournament?  Easy.  If your team wins on Sunday, you're going to be on top of the world.  Life will be all sweetness and light.  If you think about it, this is rather strange.  After all, YOU didn't score a basket, or grab a rebound in the game.  You don't even know personally any of the young men who won the victory.  But you are a fan, and you have appropriated their victory for yourself, and your life is the better for it.  In the same way, no Christian has conquered sin or been resurrected from the dead.  Yet through faith in Christ we appropriate his victory for our lives.  Beating Dook is one thing, but beating sin and death really ought to put us on top of the world.  I prefer  Christus Victor  to Anselm's Satisfaction Atonement because I think it does more justice to the entire gospel, rather than reducing salvation to the events of Good Friday.  But, I don't think you have to choose between the two.  Satisfaction Atonement is a biblically based doctrine.  Think of Paul's description of Jesus as a sin offering, and becoming a curse for us.  For those who are dominated by guilt and shame, the news that Jesus bore our shame on the cross so that we can hold our heads high before God is good news indeed.  And yet I would say that Christ's whole life, his incarnation, his teaching, his exorcisms and healings, his resurrection and ascension save us as well.  Go Jesus!

      I haven't written a word about the Haiti situation because, gee whiz, what do I know about Haiti?  But why let that stop me?  Jean Bertrand Aristide is a problematic figure.  He was elected President of Haiti in free and fair elections.  Yet this democratically elected leader has said and done some decidedly anti-democratic things.  Once upon a time he blessed the "necklacing" of his political opponents--putting burning tires around their necks.  So I'm not crazy about the guy, but then again, he was elected.  On the other hand, they say that the 2002 elections which resulted in Aristide's re-election were "disputed."  Thus his political opponents launched a revolution against him, a revolution we have given our tacit approval to.  In what way were these elections "disputed?"  Did a respected, international monitoring agency find that Aristide stole the election?  Or were they disputed in the Bush-Gore sense of the word?  If it's the latter, I wonder how Americans would feel if Democrats had marched on Washington, and the rest of the world deployed troops to our shores after President Bush left/was kidnapped from the country.  One thing's for sure, there's a fair number of thugs among the rebels.  Former henchmen of military dictatorships, and the like.  Is Aristide so bad that these guys are the lesser of two evils?  At any rate, now there are Marines in Port au Prince.  Haitians are taking pot shots at them, and the Marines are shooting to kill.  And to what end?  Whose side are we on, the necklacers or the thugs?  Just how did we make this decision to go there?  And for how long?  When I can't tell who the good guys are, and U.S. troops are in the middle, I get nervous.  Then again, if I'm ignorant about Haiti, it's my own fault.  Once upon a time I could blame the media who gave us double doses of Tonya Harding, O.J. Simpson and the like, but no international news.  But with the internet I have all the access to world events I need, but I don't take advantage of it.  So I end where I began.  I don't know anything about Haiti, and that's why I'm writing about it.

      You should be concerned about this:   (New York, March 8, 2004) – U.S. forces operating in Afghanistan have arbitrarily detained civilians, used excessive force during arrests of non-combatants, and mistreated detainees, Human Rights Watch said in a new report released today.  "The United States is setting a terrible example in Afghanistan on detention practices," said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. "Civilians are being held in a legal black hole – with no tribunals, no legal counsel, no family visits and no basic legal protections."    The United States has not responded adequately to questions about arrest and detention practices. In particular, Human Rights Watch raised the case of three detainees who are known to have died while in U.S. custody—two at the Bagram airbase north of Kabul in December 2002 and one at the Asadabad airbase in eastern Afghanistan in June 2003. The first two deaths were ruled homicides by U.S. military pathologists who performed autopsies on the two men. U.S. officials have yet to explain what happened to any of the three men.   The full report is  urlLink here .  In Iraq, it's more of the same.   urlLink Christian Peacemaker Teams  alleges that well over 10,000 Iraqis have been detained by coalition forces.  They have been subjected to beatings, deprived due process of law and denied visits by family members.  Read all about it  urlLink here .  This shameful behavior puts a stumbling block in the already long and torturous road to democracy that our leaders say we're putting these countries on.  It is in violation of international treaties that we have signed.  It's behavior that we would not tolerate for a second were it perpetrated by our foes.  Now that you're concerned, do something about it.  You can contact your President  urlLink here .  And while you're at it, mix your religion with your politics.  If you're fasting for Lent, make it in honor of the detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan.  For it is written, "Love your enemies."  And, "Is not this the fast that I choose--to loose the bonds of injustice, to undo the thongs of the yoke?"

      Despite Janet and Justin's Superbowl bump and grind, and despite boys marrying boys and girls marrying girls in California, Oregon, New Mexico and New York, the world is not going to hell in a hand basket after all.  Teenagers are having less sex, and the ones who are copulating are using birth control.  Hence the U.S. teen pregnancy rate is at its lowest point ever.  Nina Bernstein of the New York Times brings us the glad tidings in an article republished  urlLink here at The Charlotte Observer's web site .  Why haven't we heard more about this?  For one, as the article states, nobody really knows why this is happening.  Are teens getting religion?  Does sex ed really work?  Do adolescents not want to make the same mistakes their older siblings did?  Are they scared to death of AIDS?    All of the above, or some of it, or none of it.  But since nobody knows, nobody can take credit.  And since this is good news, it's not a useful piece of information to include in your direct mail solicitation.  If you want to turn on the cash spigot, "The Sky Is Falling" wrench provides much more torque than the "O What a Beautiful Morning" wrench does.  One reason we can rule out right quick:  welfare reform.  Teen pregnancies spiked long after welfare was enacted during the Great Depression, and began to decline before Congress and President Clinton enacted welfare reform in 1996.  There were other good reasons for welfare reform, but reducing the numbers of kids having kids was not one of them.

       urlLink Jesus of Montreal .  In French with English subtitles.  A priest hires Daniel, an out of work actor played by Lothaire Bluteau, to freshen up the parish's annual Passion Play.  Daniel enlists the help of two actor friends who are currently doing voice overs for porn movies, hits the library in search of the latest Jesus scholarship, and puts on a play that captivates audiences but scandalizes the church authorities.  Along the way, the lives of the three actors begin to parallel the lives of Jesus and the other gospel characters.  Jesus of Montreal is an allegory.  Look for brilliant interpretations of Salome demanding John's head on a platter, Jesus making a whip of cords and cleansing the temple, and the devil tempting Jesus with worldly power.  I still can't decide whether or not the movie's resurrection scenes (not in the play but at the end of the movie) do justice to the resurrection of Jesus.  As an allegory I think it works.  I can't say much more because even now I get choked up about that film.  There's a scene early on in the film that I'll never ever get over.  Daniel is pouring over books, and the librarian walks by.  "Looking for Jesus?"  she asks.  He nods.  "It is he who will find you."

       urlLink The Last Temptation of Christ .  This one deserves its own blog entry.  The movie concludes with Jesus, played by Willem Dafoe, getting down from the cross to live out his life as an ordinary person.  (An angel tells him that God thinks he's suffered enough).  He hooks up with Mary Magdalene and begets children, but on his deathbed he realizes that he's abandoned his true mission.  The angel was the devil in disguise.  In fact, all this is just a fantasy in Jesus' mind, his last temptation.  He clears his head, and dies on the cross.    The buzz was that the movie showed Jesus having sexual relations with a woman.  Bishops condemned it; the laity picketed.  The detractors didn't seem to understand that the sex scene was imaginary, probably because they hadn't actually seen the movie.  (Which is why I will eventually see The Passion, whatever my misgivings).    People have interesting priorities.  When priests in your charge are raping children and teens, what do you do?  Send them off to another parish on a wing and a prayer!  But what do you do when Martin Scorsese entertains the notion that Jesus entertained a notion about Mary Magdalene?  By God we won't stand for that!  I don't know why they were in such a huff.  At least Jesus' fantasy sex was procreative.    Dafoe played a Jesus who was unsure if he were God's Son or just losing his mind.  He was unsure which kind of Messiah he wanted to be--a suffering servant bringing love, or a new King David wielding an ax.  Some critics complained that Dafoe gave us a Hamlet-like Messiah, whiny, indecisive.  Conservatives hated the idea that Jesus had doubts about his divinity.  But I thought that the movie was legitimately probing how the fully human Jesus could possibly come to terms with his fully divine nature.    Last Temptation presents us with a Jesus who, in the words of Hebrews, "was tested in every way as we have been, yet without sin."  Or does it?  For Scorsese, temptation is understood solely in terms of sexual temptation.  But in the gospels, the Devil tempts Jesus with money ("turn these stones into bread"), fame ("throw yourself off the temple") and power ("all these kingdoms can be yours if you worship me"),  not sex .  An aside:  perhaps all the current fuss over gay rights is a way conservatives and liberals can distract themselves from REAL moral corruption.  In some of Scorsese's other films, namely  urlLink Taxi Driver  and  urlLink Mean Streets , marriage, sex, and women in general are also problematic.  Ironically, Scorsese might have been a more traditionally Catholic film maker than anyone is willing to give him credit for.  Scorseses's films tend to end violently and tragically.  Last Temptation, for instance, has no resurrection scene.  Iwan remarked that Scorseses's work is Christian to the extent that it exhibits a strong doctrine of original sin and judgment, but what's missing is any sense of redemption.  That's where I part ways with the movie, not with the sex.  Nonetheless, it was well worth watching.  I suspect that when I see The Passion I might feel the same way:  glad to see a thought-provoking movie, while sharply disagreeing with some of its theology.

      All this hoopla about The Passion reminds of of a class I took in seminary.  "Jesus in Celluloid" was co-taught by  urlLink Uncle George  and Iwan Russell-Jones.  Iwan, a Welsh producer for BBC-1, brought a certain intensity to the classroom that convinced us he actually BELIEVED this Christianity stuff.  Every other week we watched a Jesus movie, and every other week we read something Christological, ranging from Athanatius'  urlLink On the Incarnation  (dense but rewarding for the determined reader) to John Macquarrie's  urlLink Jesus Christ in Modern Thought .  We saw some fascinating movies, and some really bad ones, and had some fine discussions on who exactly Jesus Christ was and is.  Here are some quick reviews of some of the movies we watched:   urlLink Jesus of Nazareth .  Franco Zeffirelli's NBC mini-series, based mostly on the gospel of John.  It's a beautiful movie--lush, rich, colors.  I saw it as a child, and it was as if the felt board Jesus came to life.  Whatever it's shortcomings, I'll always remember it fondly.  Robert Powell played Jesus, and his mysterious eyes set him apart from the other characters in the movie.  Iwan wondered whether or not Jesus' physical distinctiveness was a sign of Docetism (the heresy that says that Jesus, while fully divine, only appeared to be human).  Except Iwan had a tendency to say, "Doe-seat-ism."   urlLink Jesus Christ Superstar .  The man wore long hair and sandals.  Why not set his life story to rock music?  I can't tell the difference between Cats and Evita, but Andrew Lloyd Webber's score for this musical and film sounds distinctive.  Ted Neely plays a tenor Jesus who can screech with the best 70s band, and Carl Anderson ( urlLink who recently died ) is a compelling Judas.  In fact, Jesus and Judas are the main characters of this movie, despite the fact that Judas, while playing the deciding role in Jesus' death, is a minor character in the gospels.  That's true of several Jesus movies and a lot of artwork.   urlLink Monty Python's Life of Brian .  Where do I begin?  Hysterical, razor-sharp satire of Christianity.  Graham Chapman plays Brian, a shmuck whose life parallels that of the Messiah.  The movie ends with Brian nailed to a cross, whistling and singing, "Always look on the bright side of life..."  Is this what we Christians have reduced the crucified Messiah to--the prosaic advice that "when life gives you lemons, make lemonade?"     urlLink The Gospel According to Saint Matthew .  Pasolini's word for word adaptation of the first gospel.  The critics loved it.  I hated it.  I recall that it was raining or dark throughout the movie.  Jesus talks like a machine gun, sometimes flinging words over his shoulder at the disciples rushing to keep up behind him.  I thought the whole thing was boring and tedious, and when I said so, Iwan yelled at me.  I should see it again to find out if my taste in movies has improved over time.   urlLink Jesus .  This is the movie Rowan Countians got in their mailbox last fall.  It's not bad for kids, but they cleaned up a lot of Jesus' offensiveness.  For instance, when word comes that Jesus' family is at the door, Jesus says, "My family are those who hear the word of God and do it."  Scholars take this as a repudiation of familial obligations, even more stunning then than now given the clan-based social system in Palestine.  In the movie, Jesus says this, and then runs to meet his family with a silly grin on his face.  Following this one, Rick Dietrich, a faculty member who sat in on a lot of the movies, said, "I'm still waiting to see a movie that depicts Jesus as the SOB he really was."  More movie reviews later.  For now, I must work on a sermon...

      The Roman Catholic Church is wrong about birth control.  But the California State Supreme Court was even more wrong when  urlLink they voted 6-1 to require Catholic Charities to provide birth control coverage for their employees .  A California law requires companies that provide prescription drug benefits to include The Pill in their plans.  It exempts churches.  The non-profit Catholic Charities unsuccessfully argued that it should be covered by the exemption.  The Court reasoned that the exemption only applied to internal church activities that deliberately inculcate religious values.  So the Court won't intervene in, say, a catechism class, but it will intervene in how a Church agency extends health care to its paid staff.  The Court has determined that providing health care benefits is a religious value-free zone.  The problem, obviously, is that the courts and not the churches get to decide what does and doesn't instill religious values.    This narrow view of religion as a cluster of opinions and not an embodied set of practices is an invention of Modernity.  It is not a definition of religion that any of the founders of the world's great religions would have agreed with.  For all the talk about freedom of religion in this country, the secular courts continue to restrict that freedom by confining "religion" to a smaller and smaller zone of human thinking and behavior.  What's next?  Requiring the Southern Baptist Convention to provide domestic partner benefits?  Revoking conscientious objector status for young Mennonite men?  Wouldn't they be more productive spelunking for bin Laden in Afghanistan than driving a mule team in Pennsylvania?  I can see one short term consequence of the ruling.  Suppose Catholic Charities ends its prescription drug benefit plan in order to evade the Court's directive?  Then this allegedly great victory for women's health will be a Pyrrhic victory indeed.

      Some good news from Iraq:  the U.S. appointed governing council has agreed upon a new constitution.  It will take effect when the U.S. hands sovereignty over to the Iraqis on June 30, and remain in force until a permanent constitution is written after elections choose a new government.  The constitution looks awfully Western.  It protects the rights of women, contains checks and balances, allows Islam to be a source of law for the new government but not THE source of law, and tries to hold the nation's disparate ethnic groups together while allowing a measure of autonomy to each.  The New York Times has a good summary  urlLink here .  More good news:  fewer coalition troops were killed last month than in any month since the war began.  I know the month was a little bit short, but the casualties per day average was also the lowest ever.  The data are  urlLink here .  The good news on the casualty front has to be tempered by the fact that the guerrillas are going after softer targets than coalition troops, with deadly success.  Suicide bombings at Kurdish political headquarters and at a police station killed hundreds of people in February.  Can the constitution "stick?"  Can the coalition forces reduce the overall violence in Iraq?  These are big questions.  A Yes answer is by no means certain.  But I certainly hope so.  Maybe it's the warm weather melting the snow and the first day of Spring now showing itself on the calendar, but for once it's nice to indulge in feelings of optimism about Iraq.

As for me, the quiz says that  urlLink Dennis Kucinich  is my perfect match.  But if I lived in a Super Tuesday state, I'd surely cast my vote for one of the two candidates who actually has a shot at winning the nomination.  As Eric Alterman constantly reminds us, Politics is not therapy.  I would add that primaries are not dating services.

      I don't know how many 18-26 year-old Christian men read this blog.  If you are a member of this demographic, now's the time to think about your options when and if the draft resumes.  It could happen.  The U.S. military is stretched to the breaking point, and peace in Iraq seems far, far away.  Plus there's the volatile Korean peninsula and any number of surprises that could come our way in the near future.  Another war or an escalation in the current conflicts might prompt Congress to reinstate the draft.  Senator Chuck Hagel has already wondered aloud about the possibility.  Can those of you Christians eligible for the draft kill in good conscience?  If not, you need to plan today to apply for conscientious objector status.  Presbyterians can find excellent guidance  urlLink here .  Members of other denominations may also want to look at this document.  It contains a list of important references and support agencies at the end.    In order to prove to the draft board that your opposition to the war is at the level of conscience and not expediency, it is helpful to demonstrate that your opposition to war is long-standing.  Talk to your pastor, your family and your friends now.  Commit your views to writing today.  If you're a Presbyterian, you can register with the Stated Clerk of the denomination.  That kind of certification will help immensely.  If you're under the age of 18, you'll have to register for the draft soon.  If you think that the answer to "WWJD in time of war?"  is "Not kill," you too need to get ready.  Simply writing, "My Lord Jesus Christ forbids me to kill" on your draft registration card can be a helpful form of documentation.  Of course you'll want to make a copy and keep it for your records.  Perhaps your Christian conscience is not troubled by any and all killing for the state, but may be troubled depending on the nature of the conflict.  Selective conscientious objection (objecting to a particular war on its merits rather than objecting to all wars) is an option if you are a Presbyterian, and may be for other denominations.  Again, click on the link above for more information.

         I hope you saw  urlLink Frontline  this week, and/or listened to  urlLink Fresh Air  on NPR.  Both shows were about the faith of George W. Bush, and there is just so much bloggable material in them, that I just gotta put it out there.  The underlying theme of both shows is that George W. Bush is a "born again" Christian, and there are two ways to respond to that "fact."  Some people are so happy because he is unabashedly bringing his "born again" faith into the public realm.  Others are unhappy because that religious stuff really ought to be kept private.  Those are our two choices.  Which one are you?  I am neither, of course.  Basically my problem with George W. Bush is not that he is bringing Jesus into politics.  My problem with George W. Bush is that he is not bringing Jesus into politics!  Now think on that for a spell.....  Fresh Air and Frontline, because they are not very familiar with Christian theology, assume that George W. Bush is bringing Jesus into politics.  But George W. Bush is actually bringing a privatized, pietistic Jesus (stripped of all his eschatological and social rough edges) into politics.  The only problem with that is that, from a Christian perspective, the Jesus he is bringing into politics bears very little if any resemblance to the Jesus of Scripture who is confessed by the catholic church.  The Jesus of Scripture proclaimed by the catholic church is one who blesses the peace-makers, lifts up the poor, turns social structures upside down, feeds the hungry, loves his enemies and calls his disciples to put away their swords.  Basically the Jesus of Scripture declares the acceptable year of our Lord; he is a living embodiment of God's promises to Israel to enact the year of jubilee, the fulfillment of the Sabbath.  Now THAT's the Jesus we need to bring into politics.   urlLink Richard Land  wouldn't know the year of jubilee if it bit him in the but, and it probably will some day.  The privatized, pietistic Jesus that George W. Bush carries around with him in his heart is the one people have in mind when they ask, "what would Jesus do?"  The answer is usually something like, he'd be really sweet to people.  Then of course, they turn around and bomb Iraq and Afghanistan  back into the Stone age.  George Bush has not brought the real Jesus into politics.  The contrast between George Bush and Jesus Christ could hardly be more striking: Jesus Christ the Prince of Peace, and George Bush the president of war.  They just don't mix.    It is true that there is a cosmic battle going on between good and evil.  But the dividing line goes down the middle of each person's soul.  Jesus has already defeated evil, but he defeated it through suffering love, not through brute force.  This is the message of the wonderful and beautiful Book of Revelation: the lamb has conquered, the lamb that was slain.  The one who imposes his will through brute force is the beast, the anti-Christ.  Now, I am not calling George Bush the anti-Christ, but I am saying he is acting a lot more like the beast than the lamb.  How important it is that we come to a good reading of Revelation in this day and age when that beautiful book is being so abused by the Left-behinders.  So the point is not that we need to keep religion and politics separate (what a silly idea).  The point is that we need to keep Jesus in the middle of our politics.  As a matter of fact, we need to let Jesus  urlLink transform our understanding of politics .  No one explains that better than  urlLink John Howard Yoder .  Now about this "born again" Christian talk.  It is so redundant to speak of "Born again" Christians!  All Christians are born again; the problem is that some people have a very limited and narrow understanding of what it means to be born again.  We are all born again in our baptism.  Anyone who is baptized has been born again.    Now in criticizing George W. Bush, I am not praising John Kerry.  I also think John Kerry wants to keep religion private, it's just a different religious faith he is trying to keep private.    I will give Front Line credit for interviewing Jim Wallis for about 30 seconds.  He was the only one who challenged the basic premise of the show: that you must be either "for" or "against" the mixing of Christianity and politics.    I actually liked it when George W. Bush was asked what thinker has influenced him the most, and he answered, "Jesus Christ."  I just wish that were true.

      One of  urlLink Columbia Seminary's  continuing education events is a contemplative retreat for men at the  urlLink Monastery of the Holy Spirit  in Conyers, Georgia.  I made this retreat for the first time in 1996, and I have gone off and on since then.    It's a unique experience.  Retreatants get to sit in the stalls with the monks and participate with them in the liturgy of the hours.  Vigils is at 4:00 AM.  Lauds is at 7:00 AM, followed immediately by Mass.  Vespers is at 5:30 PM, and Compline, a hauntingly beautiful tribute to the Virgin Mary, whose stained glass image is just fading at this time of year, is at 8:00 PM.  In the spirit of  ora et labora  (my Latin is poor; I hope that's correct), retreatants get put to work alongside the monks.  I've picked up trash along the highway, scrubbed floors, cleaned windows, you name it.  The afternoon is given over to a generous amount of free time, or "loafing in the Lord," as one brother calls it.  I'm not there this year, and I miss it.  It's been a beautiful week in Salisbury.  How much more so in the silent garden that Father Bob maintains beside the guest house!  The Monastery has been a place where I have been both humbled and consoled by the grace of God.  It's a place where I've seen Jesus in a way that I haven't seen him anywhere else.  In the meantime, I might order some of their  urlLink world famous, hundred proof fruitcake , and reminisce, careful to keep the fruitcake away from open flame!  I'm not the only one who missed the retreat this year.  At Tuesday's Salem Presbytery meeting, I was surprised to see John Barbour, a fellow retreatant and pastor in Virginia, being examined and approved to take a call as associate pastor at First Church, Boone.  I didn't get a chance to say Hi to him Tuesday, and I hope that we both don't have to go to Conyers next year before we see each other.

      I'm on a biography kick lately.  I've finished Bouwsma's bio of John Calvin (see sidebar) which I may or may not comment on later.  Now I've begun reading  urlLink George Marsden's new biography of Jonathan Edwards .  I haven't even gotten to the point where Edwards gets run out of town by his congregation, but the reader can already tell that the man was hard to live with.  He was light years ahead of his classmates at Yale in both intellect and piety.  Thus young Jonathan Edwards had a hard time relating to his nineteen-year-old contemporaries who were prone to pranks, drunkenness and disrespect for authority.  When his classmates staged a minor cafeteria revolt, Edwards wagged his finger disapprovingly.  In fact, they all hated him, the Know-it-all-fuddy-duddy of New Haven.  Cross Hermione Granger with Mr. Filch and that's America's greatest Reformed theologian at school.  I feel a mixture of contempt and pity for young Jonathan.  I admire his striving to be morally pure, remembering my own dismay at some of the excesses of my fellow residents of Bragaw Hall at N.C. State.  But people like Edwards were exactly what drove me away from most of the on-campus parachurch organizations.  Jonathan Edwards--patron saint of Yippy Skippy Evangelical Christianity.  That's Edwards the young man.  Edwards the young intellectual is amazing.  Like a lot of his fellow Calvinists Edwards voraciously gathered any and all new scientific information because to study the creation was to come to a deeper understanding of the Creator.  He seized on the new scientific discoveries of men like Issac Newton.  Unlike the emergent Deists, who thought that God was a spiritual reality far removed from material existence, Edwards saw in Newton's theories about gravity an immanent God, constantly creating and upholding the universe.  A divide between science and theology was unthinkable for Jonathan Edwards.  Ah, so much has changed.  Since Darwin's powerfully persuasive and utterly materialistic account of nature, science and theology have been at loggerheads.  For fundamentalists, science is the enemy.  For mainline theologians, science and theology are two ships passing in the night.  Theologians do meaning; scientists explain how things work.  Also, the shadow of Karl Barth looms large over whatever encounters science and theology might have.  Barth's polemic against "natural theology," entirely appropriate in its context--the Nazi takeover of the German church--has stifled scientific and theological dialogue.  I went to a seminary whose professors were deeply indebted to Karl Barth, and I can't remember one serious conversation about the relationship between science and religion in my three years there.  For Edwards, science and theology are of whole cloth.  I find his unified view of knowledge refreshing, and probably not at all at odds with Reformed doubts about "natural theology."  Edwards, after all, wasn't trying to deduce knowledge about God from creation alone, apart from the witness of scripture; he was looking for traces of the Triune God within the creation.    We can't unlearn what Darwin has taught us.  In that sense, there's no going back to Edwards.  But are there theologians out there who are trying to bridge the gap between science and religion?  Surely there scientists whose investigations of "nature" are also investigations of the handiwork of the Creator.

      I can't let go of one detail in Cal Thomas'  urlLink anti-Earth Day fulminations .  Brother Cal cites hotel rooms with little signs reminding you to save the earth by re-using your towel as the height of environmental extremism.  No it's not.  It's the hotel trying to get you to save them money by appealing to your sense of altruism.  But such tactics don't work with people who don't have an altruistic bone in their body.  Brother Cal would blanch if he knew how long my bath towel hangs on the shower rack before I bother to replace it with a fresh one.  So might you, Dear Reader, so I'll spare you that information.  Suffice it to say, re-using a bath towel seems an eminent example of frugality.  What kind of person is Cal Thomas, to be so threatened by such an innocuous suggestion?    Surely Brother Cal has read  urlLink Pilgrim's Progress , like all good evangelicals have.  Apparently Brother Cal learned nothing from the Puritans about thrift.  He seems to have taken their "City on a Hill" imagery and conflated it with modern American jingoism and consumerism.  Jonathan  urlLink promises to blog  about whether or not Christians and Muslims worship the same God.  I think he ought to write about whether Cal Thomas and I worship the same God.

      They include George Pataki (R-NY), Arnold Schwarzenegger  (R-CA), Tom Ridge (R-PA and Secretary of Homeland Security), and Rudolph Giuliani (R-NY).  Did they receive the Blessed Sacrament today?  I don't know because for some strange reason,  urlLink NPR's Carol Van Dam  only bothered to report this morning about Senator Kerry's sacramental habits.  I think I'll  urlLink email the NPR ombudsman  and ask why.

      When Cardinal Arinze  urlLink smacked down pro-choice Catholic politicians  (Senator John Kerry) for receiving communion, he was issuing Vatican directives about Catholic liturgy that addressed, among other things, the ritual of "passing the peace."  According to the new guidelines, "the gesture of exchanging the peace greeting should only be done 'to those who are nearest and in a sober manner.'  In many U.S. parishes, the exchange can go on for some time, with the priest greeting many worshippers."  Guess they don't want the priest out there in the pews wandering among the children.  (Sorry.)  In our congregation we pass the peace after the prayer of confession and the assurance of pardon.  It's symbolic of the horizontal character of forgiveness, but it need not be merely symbolic.  I have this fantasy that some day people in my congregation who are on the outs with each other might be moved to use this worship rite to bury the hatchet.  In that case, the parties involved might have to move far from their pews to seek out the person with whom they need to be reconciled.  I think that the Vatican rubrics are intended to maintain a little decorum at Our Lady of Perpetual Amiability.  Let worship be worship and coffee hour be coffee hour.  But let's hope that the new guidelines don't squelch an opportunity for  urlLink Euodia and Syntyche  to kiss and make up.

      ...what the right hand is doing.  In the bottom left-hand corner of page 10A in today's Charlote Observer is a  urlLink Washington Post article  saying that President Bush has convinced Americans "that most Iraqis and many foreign countries support U.S. actions."    In the top right-hand corner of the same page is a  urlLink New York Times article  that states, "Senior U.S. military commanders say many Iraqis who once cautiously supported the U.S.-led effort to stabilize Iraq are pulling back in large numbers."  We report.  You decide.

      Cal Thomas marked Earth Day by  urlLink  consigning the environmental movement  to the dust bin of history.  Today's heroes, says Thomas, include somebody named Fred Smith who's been saving corporate America from extreme environmental red tape.  The environmental movement has certainly changed since the first Earth Day in 1970.  It's become institutionalized.  Environmentalism is the extension agent teaching farmers how to plant shelter belts.  It's suburban homeowners planting native wildflowers that attract wildlife.  It's Republican County Commissioners paying rural property owners not to sell out to developers.  It's the federal Environmental Protection Agency, created by the Republican President Richard Nixon.  It's curbside recycling in big cities and small towns.  If environmentalism no longer bears the classic form of a social change movement, it's because it's woven itself into the mainstream of American life.  It's not the case, as Thomas suggests, that people no longer care.  The mainstream character of environmentalism also belies Thomas' caricature of Earth Day enthusiasts as bearded, sandal-wearing American haters who save water by bathing infrequently.  Shoot, even President Bush took two days to observe Earth Day, campaigning in the Everglades Thursday and Friday.  Despite the incorporation of environmental values into commerce and ordinary living, the environment still faces challenges.  Bucolic Rowan County, for example, has some of the worst air quality in the United States.  Ozone from cars and utilities sends hundreds of thousands of asthmatic Americans to doctors' offices and ERs every year.  (Another Thomas assertion belied; why do we have to choose between economic growth and environmental protection when cleaning up the air improves worker health?)  Environmentalists need to advocate for the most cost effective way to clean our region's dirty air.  They will, and they will succeed, just as they saved Bald Eagles from extinction and kept the Cuyahoga River from catching fire.

      A couple of new polls show President Bush leading Senator John Kerry.  There is much handwringing in the liberal blogosphere, and much studying the polls' entrails to discern what it all means.  Does bad news in Iraq give a paradoxically positive boost to the President, who's staked his campaign on foreign affairs?   urlLink Josh Marshall says  Maybe, or maybe Bush's negative ads are bearing fruit.   urlLink Alterman  calls it disconcerting.   urlLink Somebody  who commented below muttered about us getting the government we deserve.  Relax, everyone!  This is a long campaign, and the Democrats have a very good chance this year.  All they have to do is run against the President's (abysmal by any objective measurement) record:  The biggest budget surplus in history turned into the biggest deficit in history, losing the peace in Iraq, the illegal and unethical shenanigans surrounding the Medicare Prescription Drug bill,  more not less mercury in the water, etc.  This is not like running against Ronald Reagan in 1984, or Teddy Roosevelt in 1904.  We know from last time around that the Democrats will not be allowed to win a close election, so Democrats can't simply hold serve, even though they won the popular vote in 2000.  Democrats will have to change some minds to win the election.  People don't change their minds lightly, especially about a rather serious issue like who they voted for for President.  Hence the polls still show Bush leading.  But if Democrats patiently and relentlessly show the electorate what this administration has done, minds will change.  A whole lot of them.  I think that we might be in store for a repeat of 1980.  Jimmy Carter, bless his heart, was a failed President.  He was leading a party that had long enjoyed electoral supremacy, but which had begun to overreach.  A lot of people were unsure about the actor-turned politician Reagan, but the country was in such bad shape and so tired of stale liberalism that a tight race broke open late.  Reagan won in a landslide.    The bad news these days is relentless.  The Republicans have been in ascendency for a quarter century now.  People don't know a lot about John Kerry, but come November people are going to be ready to try something new.

      We have a picture Bible from which we read to the children every night before they go to bed.  A few nights ago we read about Elijah's showdown with the priests of Baal on Mount Carmel.  In the picture Bible the story is boiled down to:  some bad men thought that Baal, a little statue, was God.  But Elijah asked the real God to send fire from heaven.  Only the real God could do that.  Ethan couldn't stop laughing at the picture of the men huddled around something that looks suspiciously like one of my old debate trophies that my kids play with every once in a while.  I'm glad that idolatry seems absurd to my firstborn.  (My trophies aren't as big or as numerous as  urlLink Buck's , but I encourage you, Mike, to bring yours down from the attic and let your kids play with them.  You'd be amazed at what their imaginations can do with old junk).    So the kids are done with nailing me to a cross.  Instead they've been incinerating the Baals strewn about the living room.  Fortunately the picture Bible doesn't show the rest of the story--Elijah ordering onlookers to massacre the priests of Baal and dump their bodies in the wadi.  Otherwise they'd have simply acted out their Oedipus complex in an equally brutal, yet peculiarly Old Testament sort of way.

       urlLink Bob Woodward's new book  has generated a fistful of subplots, everything from misappropriating funds to fixing oil prices.  One of the more interesting ones swirls around Colin Powell.  Was he out of the loop when President Bush finally decided to launch the war?  Woodward says so.  Or was Powell every bit the warmonger that Cheney, Rice, Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz were?  That's what Powell says.  Not in so many words, but he claims that he was in on the decision to go to war, a decision he always supported.  Colin Powell has been the liberals' great white hope inside the Bush administration since January, 2001.  Remember when rumors circulated that Powell had decided to step down by the end of Bush's first administration?  Then came speculation that the rumors had been planted by Powell's enemies in the administration to wound him by rendering him a lame duck prematurely.  Maureen Dowd and others pouted about the unfairness of it all to such a great and solitary voice of reason inside this crazy White House.  I wonder.  The Woodward fallout ought to shatter whatever illusions liberals were still holding about the Secretary of State.  Powell is either hopelessly ineffective at shaping U.S. foreign policy, or he's on the same page as the ideologues that liberals love to hate.  Either way, no one left of the political center, and no one occupying the sane political center, should shed tears when and if Colin Powell vacates Foggy Bottom.  Liberals should have come to this conclusion long before Woodward published his book.  That speech Powell gave to the U.N. Security Council tipped public opinion in the U.S. toward supporting war on Iraq.  No one in the administration had the credibility to pull it off.  It says a lot about Powell that he burned so much of his considerable credibility with the American people on making a case for war that's subsequently been proven a fraud.

      When I park my 1991 Ford Escort on an incline, I engage the parking brake and shift into reverse.  The car rolls back ever so slightly and makes a grunting noise before it stops.  It finally dawned on me what's so familiar about that noise.  It sounds just like the cave troll in the Fellowship of The Ring.  Maybe when I finally decide to sell the thing, New Line will want to buy it.

      We grilled corn on the cob a few days ago.  This is a subject that one could blog about for hours.  I won't even try to address the typewriter versus round and round techniques for eating, but I will mention this:  when I lived in Missouri, I would go running down a dirt road that left town through corn fields.  In the fall, after the combines had harvested the corn, cobs would be strewn across the road, picked clean of corn.  I mean clean.  Not a single kernel left.  Looking at my well-worked-over corn cob the other night, I couldn't help but notice that a big machine with no sense of taste or smell could strip a corn cob better than my enthusiastic teeth.  Amazing.

      In the April 20 edition of The Christian Century,  urlLink Richard B. Hays  and  urlLink Ellen Davis  co-author an article on reading Scripture, "Beyond Criticism."  These scholars and 13 others participated in "The Scripture Project", a group convened by the Center of Theological Inquiry at Princeton from 1998-2002.    Davis and Hays put forward nine theses on interpreting Scripture.  These theses are highly nuanced and sophisticated statements concerning the nature of faithful biblical interpretation.  I will not list all nine theses in this blog, but they center around reading Scripture as a coherent narrative unity that belongs to the church.  As a church book, the Bible is only rightly interpreted by the church - it is not a document that "makes sense" to any rational human being - but only to those who are part of the community that is trying to stake its life on the truthfulness of its witness.  Two of the most important components for reading the Bible faithfully are imagination and courage.  Imagination is that human capacity to see the world in a certain way.  Reading the Bible with imagination requires that we approach the task of biblical interpretation as if it were an art, not a science.   The Enlightenment has trained people in the west to be suspicious of imagination, convinced as it was that there is only one way to see the world (through the universal category of "reason.").  We are thus left with a flat universe that is devoid of surprise and creativity.  I know that I have written about Spong before, and I won't go off on that tangent again, but it does strike me that part of Spong's problem is that he has absolutely no imagination.  His universes is flat, rational, and dead.  In contrast, the Christian Community believes in a risen Lord full of surprises.  The text of Scripture can therefore have more than one meaning - since God is its author, and God is the source of its true meaning.  Only the worshipping community puts itself under the authority of the Triune God, so the Scriptures find their true meaning through the church (not the academy!)  Reading this article made me think of the Bible as a "lens through which we see the world."  (Calvin, I think).   We do not so much look AT the Bible, but look THROUGH the Bible at the world, which is the theater of God's glory.   For example, it takes imagination to look at Iraq today and see it as a garden where the fruit of the Spirit can grow.  Instead, it looks like a wild jungle of violence and chaos.  But those for whom the Scripture is the lens through which we look at Iraq can see it as a place where people could one day beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks.  And we are called to live now in the reality of the "already" kingdom, even though it is "not yet" here in its fullness.    And that leads me to the second component of faithful Scripture reading, which is courage.  We see this courage in the lives of  urlLink Christian pacifists  who are in Iraq now trying to be agents of mercy and grace and hope and peace.  They are risking their lives, but there is no other way to read Scripture faithfully, other than putting our lives in Jesus' hands.  The saints of the church through the ages have set us an example, and we read the Scriptures in communion with them.    Hays and Davis emphasize the inter-dependence that exists between the Old and New Testaments (listen up, dispensationalists!).  One cannot be understood apart from the other.  This article, along with the book which they co-edited, The Art of Reading Scripture, opens up breathing space for us to have fresh encounters with the Triune God to whom the Scriptures bear witness.  Yes, God still has more light yet to break forth from His Holy Word.    (This is the second in a series of responses to the April 20 Christian Century.  The next one will be on the Jon D. Levenson article, "Do Christians and Muslims worship the same God?")

       urlLink whyvern  has urged us to read Dennis Kucinich's plan for the future of Iraq.  It's  urlLink here , and John Kerry's plan is  urlLink here .  The key differences, other than the fact that Kerry is far, far, far more likely to get a shot at putting his plan into place, are these:  Kucinich calls for a U.N. peacekeeping force that would gradually replace U.S. troops.  Kerry advocates a NATO force, under U.S. command, and a civilian role for the U.N.  Kucinich calls for reparations for innocent civilians who've suffered due to the war.  Kerry doesn't mention that.  Kucinich castigates sweetheart deals that the Bush administration has struck with U.S. companies in charge of the reconstruction.  Kerry doesn't address that either.  Kerry, unlike Kucinich, acknowledges that the U.N. is already involved in Iraq to a certain degree through the mediation of Mr. Brahimi.  He adds that the Bush administration ought to support the U.N. further by agreeing in advance to support any plan that Brahimi can hammer out with Iraqi leaders.  Give credit to Kucinich for raising issues that Kerry won't.  But give them both credit for at least having a plan.  All the current occupants of 1600 PA Ave. have are swagger.

      Over a year ago, before the war began, the anti-war crowd warned that invading Iraq would result in a long, costly occupation of an increasingly resentful, multi-ethnic state.  The administration said, "Stop frightening people.  We'll beat them in a matter of weeks; they'll welcome us with rose petals, and most of our troops will be home by the end of the year.  A year later, it's gone pretty much the way the anti-war crowd said it would.  And when they point this out, the administration and its sycophants in the press retort, "What do you expect?  We're still in Japan and Germany, 60 years after WWII!"  As if they'd never told us a year ago that it's be a cake walk.  They take the electorate for fools.  I don't think they're fools.  I think that when they throw out this incompetent, reckless crew in November, they'll demonstrate that their attention spans are longer than the right wing elites give them credit for.

      The family spent some time with "the general American public" today.  Ethan plays baseball in the Challenger League, a baseball league for children with physical, mental or social disabilities.  Each player has a buddy that shadows him or her when they are at the plate or in the field.  Ethan played well.  He got a hit off a ball pitched to him, rather than having the ball set on the tee.  And he ran all over the place chasing down grounders.  He made friends with his buddy, a tall woman who plays basketball for Catawba College.  In the stands, Mom, Dad, grandparents and little brother had a ball.  But there was one fly in the ointment.  Some mother nearby saw her son returning from the playground, glasses askew and crying.  "What the f--- happened?"  she roared.  She saw a girl on the playground, and she yelled, "Did she push you?"  "No," yelled back a man from the playground.  "He just fell down."  Dropping the F-bomb in front of toddlers and grandparents--way, way out of line.  But what to do?  I didn't do anything.  If I'd said, "Your language is inappropriate," that would have just triggered another obscene explosion.  Now, it's a long leap from bleacher profanity to the No Child Left Behind Act, but clear out of the way while I jump.  The public has been losing confidence in public schools for a while.  Politicians have responded by establishing tough testing standards.  They are holding teachers and administrators accountable for student performance.  But from what I hear about public schools, the problem isn't "Johnny can't read."  The problem is, "Johnny can't behave."  I could bore you silly with anecdote after anecdote about violent, disrespectful, profane children.  What's the matter with them?  Judging by what I heard at the ball park today, it's not the children.  It's the parents.  But Congress and state legislatures cannot pass a law holding parents responsible for their children's civility.  So they'll hold their employees responsible for children's education.  They can collect data churned out by standardized tests and say to the public, "We're improving education."  No they aren't.  Because the public, not the teachers, is to blame for the problems in education.  Rest assured, the same parent who screams "What the f--- happened?" at the sight of her disheveled child is going to give the same treatment to that child's teacher when the child brings home a failing grade.  Multiply that treatment by the rest of the children in the classroom, and what is a teacher supposed to do?  The thick-skinned ones may damn the torpedoes and hold the child accountable despite the huffing and puffing from parents who think someone else is always to blame.  Especially if the principal backs her.  But the thin-skinned ones, or the ones who don't get support from the administration probably leave the profession, or decide that it's not worth it, and pass these children along.  How do you write a law that fixes that problem?

      Inflation may be back.  According to  urlLink this AP report , consumer prices rose 0.5% in March.  And it's not just gas.  The core rate of inflation, excluding the volatile fuel and food sectors, was up 0.4% last month.  Inflation in the first quarter of 2004 rose at an annualized rate of 5.1%, compared to 1.9% for all of 2003.  Talking heads interviewed by the AP reporter speculate that the fed might have to raise interest rates earlier than they wanted to in order to nip inflation in the bud.  I'm too cynical to believe that Mr. Greenspan would really raise rates in a year that an incumbent Republican President is facing re-election, but so many strange things have happened lately...  Rising prices combined with last month's extraordinary rise in employment mean that the economy is really strengthening.  That makes President Bush's appeals to make his tax cuts permanent all the more ludicrous.  This economy does not need more stimulus.  It needs fiscal discipline at the federal level.  More tax cuts for those who can afford to attend President Bush's $2,000 per plate fundraisers will mean more federal borrowing, more dollars chasing consumer goods, more inflation, higher interest rates and a housing market collapse to rival the NASDAQ collapse in 2000.  If you think the deficits are big now, just wait until after Bush's re-election.  The deficits would already be a lot worse were it not for the extraordinarily low interest rates we're seen over the past three years.  More tax cuts combined with higher interest rates will drown us in red ink.

      In 1944 the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (US) adopted  urlLink this position paper on dispensationalism .  The paper does not declare dispensationalism a heresy.  It does state that dispensationalism is incompatable with Presbyterian doctrinal standards.  At that time, those standards were limited to the Westminster Confession and the Shorter and Larger Catechisms.  In short, the paper faults dispensationalism for chopping up God's one plan for salvation, expressed through various covenants in Biblical history, and leaving us with several different plans for salvation.  It also insists that Reformed theology knows of only one elect people, whereas dispensationalism posits two elect communities with different criteria for salvation, and different rewards and punishments.  The paper accuses dispensationalism of giving the kingly work of Christ in the present day short shrift.    The paper sees itself as a guide to sessions and presbyteries for examining people standing for ordination.  It hopes that its findings will find their way into Presbyterian educational curriculum.  But that's not quite the same as saying dispensationalism is a heresy.  That would mean that dispensationalists could not be members of the Presbyterian Church, or receive the sacraments, correct?

      A few weeks ago, when I first posted on this blog, I had a review of Jason Byassee's  urlLink review  of the Purpose Driven books.  Well, Jason must have some sort of contract with the Christian Century, because he has another review of two other books, both of which are critiques of the Left Behind series.  Unfortunately, Jason's latest Christian Century article is not posted on their  urlLink web site  yet.  But this one is another great article from Jason Byassee.  I've only met Jason once, but he seems to write on the same kind of stuff I'm interested in.  As a matter of fact, the whole April 20th edition of The Christian Century is profoundly interesting.  You can't always say that about the journal that used to be the standard liberal protestant read.  Now-a-days, The Christian Century is one of the most interesting things I read.  This despite the fact that I once heard Stanley Hauerwas say that he no longer reads the Christian Century because it is hopelessly enslaved to protestant liberalism.  Well, sorry Stan, but I think you stopped reading The Christian Century at just about the time that it started to get interesting.  (One of the things that makes it interesting is that many of the authors who now write for it have been greatly influenced by Hauerwas).  Forgive me for rambling a bit.  Back to Jason's article.  It contains a number of wonderful insights, among them:  Jason describes the following deep irony: "For generations mainline Protestants have tried to 'demythologize' the contents of scriptures and creeds in an effort to gain social and political influence, while dispensationalists, have avidly 'mythologized' the Bible into ever more incredible systems of belief about the 'end times.'  Mainline churches' influence has sagged as we have carried out this bargain, while the dispensationalists' has grown immensely."  Wow - now that one set me to thinkin'.  Did you catch that?  The more relevant mainline Protestants have tried to become, the more irrelevant they have become.  The more Protestants have been willing to be irrelevant, the more relevant they have become.  That'll preach.... for a long time, that'll preach.  On another day, I want to "preach" on that irony -- coming soon on this blog....  For now, I want to lift up one other idea in Jason's article:  We should denounce dispensationalism as a heresy.  We mainliners can't do that right now, because most mainline pastors do not know (or even care) about dispensationalism.  Even more problematic, they have never even had to wrestle theologically with the whole idea of eschatology.  But if we did declare dispensationalism as a heresy, that would require pastors to do more theological homework, and that would be a good thing.  Marvin, can you set up a poll (I don't know how to) on whether dispensationalism should be declared a heresy?  I would be interested in seeing the results.  I will be publishing in the next few days additional posts about the April 20th edition of the Christian Century, including responses to the Richard Hays/Ellen Davis article, and the Jon D. Levenson article entitled, "Do Christians and Muslims worship the same God?"  Much more later.

       urlLink The Fourth Geneva Convention  says the following about repatriation of refugees following armed conflict, and the possibility of an occupying power settling conquered territory with its own citizens:   Art. 49. Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.  Nevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bounds of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased.  The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated.  The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as soon as they have taken place.  The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.  The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.   And the  urlLink New York Times says  the following about President Bush's endorsement of Ariel Sharon's "disengagement plan" in the Middle East:     In a major shift in American policy that was already angering many Arabs on Wednesday night, Mr. Bush said that Israel should not have to return to its pre-1967 borders, and that Palestinians and their descendants who lost their land in Israel in 1948 should eventually be settled in a Palestinian state, not back in Israel. The president's pronouncement effectively ruled out any "right of return" by Palestinians.   "In light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli population centers, it is unrealistic that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949," Mr. Bush said in a news conference with Mr. Sharon in the Cross Hall of the White House.    If you violate international law long enough, you're sure to get away with it.  Especially if you're the state of Israel.

      My boys are such... boys.  We showed them the Jesus movie, and who'd they identify with?  The soldiers who crucified Christ.  So much so, they love to roll play the crucifixion.  I get to be Jesus, and they pretend to hammer nails in my hands.  They pressed into service Andrew's Indian head gear from last Thanksgiving as a crown of thorns.  When we open the garage door to let them ride bikes up and down the driveway, Ethan would rather arrange some old boards in a cross formation and lie on them, arms outstretched.    We got a little tired of this after a while, so we told them that after Good Friday they'd have to play some other game, like rolling away a stone and raising someone from the dead.  But boys being boys, that just increased their zeal for the crucifixion all the more.  Don't tell me they need professional help.  Ethan's autistic, and we're already getting professional help.  Saint Benedict, in his  urlLink Rule  for monastic communities, urges the novice monk to make his life a perpetual Lent.  I wonder if my Presbyterian sons aren't predestined for monastic living.  Either that, or being cast in Bud Cort's death obsessed role in a remake of  urlLink Harold and Maude .

      A letter-to-the-editor in today's Charlotte Observer recommends that John Kerry tap either Howard Dean or Ralph Nader to be his running mate.  They're outsiders, reasons the author, and they'd deliver voters who might not automatically vote for Kerry.  The "shoring up the left flank" theory.  I'm ready to support Dean for VP for another reason.  He tells the truth.  In December the Doctor dared to speak the obvious but unpopular truth that the capture of Saddam Hussein did not make America safer.  That was the beginning of the end of Dean's campaign, but since they pulled Saddam from his spider hole,  urlLink 186 Americans have been killed  by hostile fire in Iraq.  Washington, like Jerusalem, is a city that stones the prophets, but that doesn't mean that the capital city doesn't need prophets.  Democrats ought to send Dr. Dean to Washington.

      The Christian Century's  urlLink James Wall  has seen The Passion.  Mel Gibson's violent and gory depiction of the death of Jesus reminded him of the 16th century artist Matthias Grunewald's image of the crucifixion on the altar at the church in Isenheim.  Karl Barth also drew inspiration from this masterpiece.  John the Baptist stands to right of the cross, pointing at Jesus ("Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world").  Barth worked with a print of Grunewald's crucifixion before him, signifying his conviction that scripture points to Jesus Christ.   urlLink Iwan  writes that the cinematography of The Passion reminds him of the Italian artist Caravaggio, whose portraits exhibited vivid contrasts between light and darkness.  So below, for your Good Friday meditation, is Grunewald's crucifixion and Caravaggio's Crucifixion of Saint Peter:   urlLink      urlLink

After outlining options for increased troop strengths, he said, "But I don't want to give the impression that everything is spinning out of control, because it's not."  He added: "It's our judgment that at the present time we need to ensure that there is no misunderstanding on the side of those who oppose us that we will do whatever is necessary to get the situation under control."

      When George W. Bush ran for President in 2000 he expressed contempt for "nation building."  But after 9/11 the President launched a preemptive war that promised to spread democracy throughout the Middle East.  Had Al Qaeda converted the isolationist-leaning Republicans to a Wilsonian foreign policy?  No.  The administration's contempt for nation building is on display for all to see in post war Iraq.   urlLink Their only plan  for the aftermath of the war was to stockpile food in the event of a humanitarian crisis, and hand the keys over to Mr. Chalabi and his merry band of exiles.  Remember how a U.S. General told Congress that tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers would need to be stationed in Iraq indefinitely, and Paul Wolfowitz publicly slammed his numbers as "way off the mark?"  We are reaping the bitter fruit of post war planning based on wishful thinking.  The fierce fighting in six major cities in Iraq cannot be dismissed as the work of foreign fighters and malcontents.  There is broad and deep unhappiness with us in Iraq.  It began with the failure to control looting last April and May.  It intensified as we decommissioned the old Iraqi army, unemploying thousands of young Iraqi men.  It surged as we failed to secure borders, maintain internal security, and restore infrastructure in a timely fashion.   urlLink Our allies the British have complained  that the Coalition Provisional Authority is staffed with Bush's sycophants, and it's work is driven mostly by a desire to boost the President's re-election chances (Mr. Bremer ought to "Seek ye first the kingdom of Iraq and its righteousness, and all these things will be added unto you").  What's maddening is that any looking back, any analysis of how we've gotten into this mess (and it is a mess, even the most dogged supporters of this administration have to admit that), is dismissed as "revisionist history," or "playing the blame game."  They simply won't take responsibility for the consequences of their poor planning.  It's hard to express how angry the whole situation makes me.  What to do with all the anger?  What should "we" do in Iraq?  I haven't a clue.  I can't vote against this administration until November.  Dennis Kucinich's plan to withdraw U.S. troops in Iraq will certainly lead to a civil war, and probably a regional war, as Iran and Turkey both move on a weakened Iraq for their own reasons.  "Turn Iraq over to the U.N." is the mantra that's repeated at all the liberal blogs, but 10 years after  urlLink Rwanda  and nine years after  urlLink Srebrenica  no one should have any illusions about either the will or the competence of the U.N. to restore order and defend the innocent.  Perhaps the problem is with the "we" in that previous paragraph.  When we wonder, "What should we do in Iraq?"  why is the "we" always the United States or the international community?  Why isn't it the Church of Jesus Christ?  After all, "we" are entrusted with the  urlLink ministry of reconciliation .  Our sacred scriptures testify that God, not the nations, is Lord of the universe.  I keep returning to  urlLink CPT's invitation to fast and pray  during Lent for Iraq.  I know that prayer and fasting will seem like ridiculously naive "solutions" to the violence in Iraq, but I cannot think of a better solution at this time.  At least prayer and fasting puts faith in a more competent authority than the Bush administration or the U.N.    CPT says "It is time to ask for miracles - to empty ourselves and beg for God's mercy and compassion."  Too bad that we think that we're competent to manage our affairs, until it's clear that we're not, and only then do we hope for, look for, or ask for a miracle.  If we asked for a miracle at the outset, maybe we wouldn't get ourselves into these messes.  But now that we're in a mess, it's time to acknowledge that only a miracle can fix this, or any situation.

      I know I'm beating a dead horse, but surely somebody out there cares.  Apparently American soldiers forced two Iraqi detainees to jump from a bridge into the Tigris River.  One of the detainees may have died.    Adding insult to injury, Army Lt. Colonel Nate Sassaman  urlLink has been disciplined  for obstructing the investigation into the incident.  You may remember Sassaman for a couple of reasons.  He was a star quarterback at West Point.  More recently, he explained his decision to wrap an entire Iraqi hamlet in barbed wire, saying, "With a heavy dose of fear and violence, and a lot of money for projects, I think we can convince these people that we are here to help them."  Yeah, if I'd made it to the shore of the Tigris River I'd have no doubt that Lt. Col. Sassaman was down with me.  There's five days left in Lent, not too late for you to take up Christian Peacemaker Teams' offer to  urlLink fast for the well being of Iraqi detainees .  Better yet, why not  urlLink adopt a detainee ?

       urlLink Atrios  has kept us updated on right wing attitudes toward the latest Iraqi violence.  Bill O'Reilly wants to know why we don't "knock down" Fallujah.  Just what does O'Rightwingnut have in mind?  Fire bomb the city like we did Dresden?  Or how about an old fashioned seige.  Starve 'em out, yeah, yeah!  Kathleen Parker votes for nuclear weapons.  So do her husband and kids.  The family that bombs together stays together.  These are the same people who were assuring us a year ago that Iraqis would shower us with rose petals when we entered their fair country.  But some Iraqis don't appreciate all the love we've shown them, and now O'Reilly and Parker want to teach them a lesson.    It's a strange dynamic, the love-hate relationship the right wing punditry has with innocent Iraqi civilians.  Almost like a batterer's relationship with his wife or girlfriend.  So many professions of love for her, but if something goes wrong, watch out!

       And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling and those who were buying in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves, and he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple.  He was teaching and saying, "Is it not written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations?'  But you have made it a den of robbers."   ( urlLink Mark 11: 15b-17 )  I once heard John Dominic Crossan speak at Myers Park Baptist Church in Charlotte.  I'm not a Jesus seminar kind of guy, but his observation on this text was priceless.  Crossan noted that most people conclude that Jesus was condemning the temple establishment for ripping off worshippers who came to buy animals and offer them in sacrifice.  "A den of robbers," Jesus said.  "But robbers don't do their robbing in their dens," Crossan countered.  "Their den is their safe house where they divide the loot, out of site of the authorities."  That'll preach...

      Gary Dorrien's overview of the theology of Karl Barth (see sidebar) contrasts Barth's understanding of the resurrection with his colleague Rudolf Bultmann.  That's worth blogging about eight days before Easter!    First, what they held in common:  Both scholars distrusted any attempts to build Christian faith on a historical reconstruction of Christian origins.  Neither, Dorrien says, would have much use for the versions of Christianity that have spun off from the work of the  urlLink Jesus Seminar .    Bultmann thought that the cosmology of the Bible, shot through with miracles, angels and demons, was not credible to modern people.  The Bible had to be demythologized--its narratives translated into terms that people with a rational, scientific outlook could accept.  Bultmann thought that the empty tomb and the appearances of the risen Christ attested to the restoration of the disciples' faith in the crucified Christ.  Easter is something that happens to the believer, not to the dead body of Jesus.    Barth disagreed, insisting that the resurrection actually happened to Jesus in the real world in which we all live.  He didn't think that Christian theology had any burden to address certain world views, scientific or otherwise.  He asserted that the whole New Testament affirms the happenedness of Easter, and Bultmann's demythologized resurrection gave away the store.    And yet Barth distinguished the resurrection from other historical events.  Though it "really happened," it can't be verified; it can only be believed in.  Christ didn't appear to the first century Jewish historian Josephus, but only to those called to be witnesses, as the book of Acts puts it.  Barth wanted to be a "faith alone" theologian in the manner of the Reformers, not a "faith in whatever historical criticism can establish as plausible" theologian.    Dorrien shrewdly points out that 1 Corinthians 15 undermines both Bultmann and Barth.   Contra  the former, Paul says clearly, "If Christ is not raised, then your faith is in vain." There is no Easter faith if Easter didn't happen.    But against Barth, Paul doesn't proclaim the resurrection in Barth's "like it or lump it" manner (to quote another dead German theologian, Dietrich Bonhoeffer).  Paul marshals evidentiary arguments in favor of the resurrection, citing multiple witnesses of the Risen Christ, some of whom were still living when Paul wrote this letter.    Bultmann is wrong about what modern people are willing to swallow.  The scientific and technological revolution is more entrenched now than when Bultmann was the king of New Testament studies, yet people are still attracted to the spiritual, the numinous, the mystical, the decidedly non-scientific.  Feng Shui.  The X Files.  Touched by an Angel.  Crystals.  Fundamentalism.  Etc.  Bultmann would have served the church and academy better had he helped people discern the spirits rather than pander to a few intellectuals who'd given up on a belief in an enchanted world.    I side with Barth's insistence on the happenedness of the resurrection.  Easter has always been controversial.  Apparently there were Christians in the Corinthian church who denied the resurrection.  According to  urlLink this excellent book , Gnostic Christians in ancient Rome spiritualized the resurrection in ways similar to modern scholars like Bultmann and Marcus Borg.  Yet the New Testament and the dogmas of the Church continued to insist that God breathed new and qualitatively different life into the dead body of Jesus.     urlLink N.T. Wright , the anti-Jesus Seminar, historical Jesus scholar, rightly maintains that giving up on the resurrection is to give up on creaturely existence as such.  Without the resurrection of the body, there's no need for Christians to heal the sick or let the oppressed go free.  But Wright, unlike Barth, defends the resurrection on historical grounds.  That the thing happened is the most plausible explanation for the proclamation and practice of the first Christians, says Wright.    Since Barth tended to reserve his harshest criticism for the people whose opinions were closest to his own, were he alive today, he'd be a lot harder on Wright than the Jesus Seminar.  And with that, I have to remember the wise words of one of my theology professors:  God don't do theology.  People do theology.

      Why doesn't John Shelby Spong simply become a Unitarian?   urlLink This is an interesting exchange  between a real Anglican (Rowan Williams) and a Unitarian who is pretending to be an Anglican (John Shelby Spong).  I am not trying to insult Spong by calling him a Unitarian.  I am simply saying that he could more authentically be his own true self as a Unitarian rather than as an Anglican.    I for one am a Methodist.  But if after careful examination of Wesleyan doctrine, I realized that I had more in common with Lutheran theology, I would simply become a Lutheran.  I would not try to change the Methodist Church and insist that it become more Lutheran.  I am not arguing at this point for Methodism or Lutheranism, I'm just saying, be who you are.  In a similar way, if John Shelby Spong really believes what he apparently believes, he should be a Unitarian, not an Anglican.  Instead of doing this, however, he is asking the Anglican church to become more Unitarian.  The honest thing for him to do would be for him to become Unitarian.  Does he have enough integrity to do this?

      NPR is still calling them "civilian contractors" or "security guards," not mercenaries.  In my mind, a "civilian contractor" is an engineer, and a "security guard" is that portly man you file past when you attend a high school football game.  He's the one you knew would never catch you if you got in trouble and had to run for it.  Then again, NPR also calls prostitutes "sex workers."  When I think of a sex worker, I think of my friend Randy, who stocks condom machines throughout the southeastern U.S.  He's a man with $15,000 in his van at any one time, but he's is completely safe because it's all in quarters.  A prostitute is a prostitute.  I'm not trying to insult anybody.  Jesus was a friend of prostitutes.  This is not a question of semantics.  In  urlLink this article , a man questions our continued presence in Iraq, saying, "I hope that our Congress and our president were looking at those pictures, and if we're going to be there let's fight.  When you see people killing civilians, dragging them through the streets and hanging them up, where are our Marines?"  I think that guy would have a different understanding of the situation if he knew that these "civilians" were ex-Navy Seals.

      The cover of today's Charlotte Observer featured a photo of the charred body of one of the American mercenaries hanging from a bridge in Fallujah.  I didn't know what I was looking at until I read the caption, and I still can't tell if he was hanging by his head, arms or legs.  Inside the Observer, the publisher wrote a short article defending the publication of the photograph, saying, in effect,  urlLink Don't shoot the messenger .  I imagine that some people will want to shoot the messenger.  No doubt they will decry the "liberal" Observer for giving aid and comfort to the enemy by printing such a photo.  They forget how hawkish the Observer's editorials were leading up to the war.  I also wonder if the same people who are upset with a still photo of real, live violence are the same people who praised the two and one half hours of unrelenting simulated violence in The Passion.  I wonder if they're the same people who've said, "You just can't appreciate what he did for you until you see the movie."  Well then, you had better take a close look at that photo so that you'll appreciate the consequences of this war you've so zealously supported.  The logic works both ways, it seems to me.

      "U.S. troops on Thursday vowed to use  urlLink overwhelming force  to enter the volatile Iraqi town of Falluja and hunt down those who killed and mutilated four American contractors."  Hmmm.  My heart really does go out to the families of those four American contractors.  If I had my way, those contractors would never had gone to Iraq, and they'd be with their families right now.  But there's a deeper problem here somewhere.  Let's see if we can peel back the layers.....  One of the criteria for a war being called just is proportionality.  It is difficult to imagine how US officials can vow an "overwhelming" display of force in response to a limited act of aggression and still call that just.  The "overwhelming" show of force would probably violate the criterion of discrimination.  Soldiers must be able to "discriminate" between civilians and enemy soldiers.  Civilians should never intentionally be killed.    Which brings us around to a deeper problem.  Does it makes sense at all in modern times to speak of a just war?  A reasonable argument could be made either way.   In some sense, the very term "just war" is no longer relevant to our present situation.  "Just war" theory was developed in medieval Europe, and actually even earlier with Augustine and Ambrose.  It even had pagan sources with Cicero and other Roman and Greek officials.  The point is, when this theory was developing, it made sense to speak of proportionality and discrimination.  A soldier actually saw the person he was killing.  He did it "by hand."  In modern warfare, people often don't even see the person who is being killed.  When a bomb is dropped or a missile launched from miles away, who knows whom it will kill?  Civilians?  Enemy combatants?  Children?  The very nature of modern warfare guarantees that civilians will be killed, because "overwhelming" force is used.   Don't be distracted by talk of "smart bombs."  They aren't as "smart" as we may think.  They often land in the wrong place, killing who knows how many people, many of them civilians.  On the other hand, a just war might be fought after all.  But it would have to be fought differently than the way the Iraq war was fought.  The war in Iraq is being fought in such a way as to keep to a minimum the American casualties.  The only way to do that is to use "overwhelming" force.  So in fighting a war that keeps American casualties to a minimum, it usually means that we have to violate the criteria of proportionality and discrimination.  To fight a truly "just war" we would have to use much more limited force, much smaller weapons, an "underwhelming" use of force.  Imagine soldiers doing their fighting with swords, shields, bows, and arrows.  Or even with small hand guns.  Or even a hunting rifle.    The point is, this would actually mean the soldiers had to see the person they were killing - so that they could make sure they were discriminating between civilians and combatants.    Now, if the US fought wars, justly, like that, there would be so many American casualties, that the American people would rise up and demand an end to the war immediately.  So we have a situation where the American public does not really want a just war, they want, in effect, a crusade.  An all-out war against the enemy.  Now most Americans think that the only just war is a crusade.  Americans are willing to fight a crusade, but fighting a just war would require too much of a sacrifice on our parts.  But we still need the "just war" rhetoric to convince ourselves that we are morally justified.  We thereby lose the sense in which "just war" was not a checklist to be met before we start a war, but a way to limit the amount of violence in a war.  It was actually used by Augustine and others as a tool to help soldiers confess their sins.  But now it is a tool of politicians to deceive the masses.  It was created in a context where combat was personal; it is now used in a context where killing is very impersonal.   Keep in mind, that according to just war theory, one must be willing to lose a war rather than fight it unjustly.  Can you imagine anyone at the Pentagon saying, "well, we'll just have to lose this war, because we can't win it without killing civilians."  Nope.  And if we are to take just war seriously, we must obligate ourselves to just war rules whether the other side observes those rules or not.  For those who will use Biblical stories to justify modern-day war, I would suggest that if we fought wars the way they did in the Bible, I would not object.  That is, if we invaded Baghdad by marching around it for several days and then blowing trumpets, that would be o.k. with me.    Ah, the just war theory.  It creates the appearance of morality, but underneath, it is a raging beast.

      All day Wednesday NPR reported that four American "civilians" had been killed in Fallujah, Iraq.  This morning, thanks to  urlLink this article in the Charlotte Observer , I know more about who these people were.  The four were employed by North Carolina-based Blackwater USA, a company that recruits police officers and former military personnel, and trains them to provide security for whoever hires them.  Blackwater employees guard Paul Bremmer, ride shotgun on food convoys and defuse roadside bombs.  The article refers to them as "contractors."  It states that as many as 15,000 are operating in Iraq.  Civilians?  Contractors?  Didn't we used to call these people "mercenaries?"  We live in the age of war by euphemism, where civilian casualties are relabeled collateral damage, wars of aggression are dressed up as preemptive wars, and mercenaries are christened civilian contractors.  Why so many mercenaries in Iraq?  The article states that using such folks keeps down the casualty count of soldiers in uniform, and tends to minimize the outcry after violence.  "It almost puts a layer between political bosses and events on the ground.  Appearances are everything," said one expert.  The comment link is below...

      I'm not the only one  urlLink taking pot shots  at the National Council of Church's statement on Iraq.   urlLink Mark Kleiman , taking a different tack, slammed the NCC for shooting its mouth off about stuff it's ignorant about.  He writes:   Of course, ministers and heads of denominations have the right to express their opinions on public issues. If they're speaking as experts on what their religious traditions teach, then those who care about what those religious traditions teach ought to listen to them with the respect accorded to experts.  But if they're just expressing their (inexpert) opinions on, e.g., the appropriate role of the United Nations in the reconstruction of Iraq, it's not obvious why anyone should pay any particular attention to those views unless they're backed with independently convincing reasons and analysis.  And yes, that applies to bloggers in general, and to me in particular.    Apparently these comments have  urlLink generated an uproar  in the liberal blogosphere.  My sense, from following links here and there, is that some people are angry at Kleiman because they think he's saying that Christian ministers are dumb, or that Christian ministers are unqualified to express an opinion about public policy, especially about something on the magnitude of Iraqi reconstruction.  I don't think that he's saying that.  It sounds to me like all he's saying is that ministers aren't policy wonks; they're ministers, and they should make a contribution from their area of expertise.  I tend to agree with Kleiman, even if that undermines the great seriousness with which all my readers soak up my opinions about the issues of the day.  :)    This dustup reminds me of a little essay titled "The Legitimacy of a Sectarian Hermeneutic" in  urlLink Walter Brueggemann's  book  urlLink Interpretation and Obedience .  Brueggemann cites an obscure Old Testament story from the Book of Kings about the Assyrian seige of Jerusalem.  An Assyrian diplomat meets representatives of King Hezekiah at the city wall.  The King's men beg the Assyrian not to speak in Hebrew because they do not want him to frighten the city's residents by making his bombastic taunts in a language they can understand.  But the Assyrian diplomat speaks in Hebrew for just that reason.  The King's men return to Hezekiah with a report about the Assyrian ultimatum.  Hezekiah goes to the temple to pray, and there he is reassured that the city will not fall.  Brueggemann uses this story to urge that Christians be bilingual.  We have to speak the language of faith behind the wall in order to nurture that faith.  That language then has to be translated at the wall in order to speak to the wider world:  those who do not share our faith or those whose ways are hostile to the commonwealth that God envisions for God's community.  However, Brueggemann stresses that fluency in the language behind the wall is most important; otherwise when the faith community goes to the wall it will wind up letting the powers-that-be dictate the parameters of the conversation.    I suppose that the finest example of this in recent American history is the Civil Rights Movement.  Preachers like Martin Luther King, Jr. translated the Biblical language of redemption into the secular language of "liberty and justice for all."  Their practices of self-denial, confession and purification "behind the wall" generated a new form of political involvement "at the wall," a non-violent movement for social change.  I may be misinterpreting Kleiman, but what I hear him saying is that the minister's first task is to enable his/her flock to be proficient in the language behind the wall in order that new possibilities for public policy may be put on the table at the wall.  Of course, if there's no one who's bilingual, then the world will not understand the church's unique vision.  But first things first.  The problem with denominational bureaucrats and NCC officials is that they've been at the wall too long.  All they can do is choose between the sterile solutions that the "outside world" offers us:  unilateralism or multilateralism.  This is a lot like choosing between the Assyrian diplomat's choices of death or exile.  You can read the NCC's pastoral letter  urlLink here .  There's some "behind the wall" stuff in there, namely an invitation to pray for the troops and the politicians.  But it seems "tacked on," like those dreadful "opening and closing prayers" we tack on like bookends to our Session or Presbytery meetings--a nod to God, and now let's get on with the "real business."  The real business of the so-called pastoral letter is urging us to write our Congressmen and get them to turn Iraq over to the U.N.  In contrast,  urlLink Christian Peacemaker Teams  put their "Lenten Call to Pray and Fast for Iraqi Detainees" front and center on their web site.  Invitations to write your Congressman were also there, but the emphasis was on the weapons of the Spirit, not on politics as usual.  Given the fact that the Abu Ghraib Abuse story broke shortly after the end of Lent, and given my own Reformed doctrine of providence, I can't help but conclude that CPT knew better than the NCC how to establish peace with justice in Iraq.  We should all go and do likewise.

      Good news!  The sidewalk was shiny and wet when I left for church this morning.  One parishioner reported two tenths of an inch of rain in his gauge.  Alas, we need more than that for my garden to thrive, and for my zest for writing to return (at this, some out there may be praying for a prolonged drought!)  Think of all the things I could be blogging about, if only it would rain:  the CPA pulling the rug out from under Mr. Brahimi, my deepening love affair with the  urlLink Aubrey-Maturin series , whether there is or ought to be such a thing as  urlLink The Religious Left , the Tower of Babel, and so forth.  And while we're on the subject of the weather,  urlLink here's  a reporter who finally grew a spine.  Global warming is happening, and it's happening because humans are burning prodigious amounts of fossil fuels, he states unequivocally.    The impact, he acknowledges, is a little less clear.  Global warming might produce localized cooling, say, in northern Europe where the Gulf Stream currently moderates the climate.  If the ice caps experience significant melting, all that fresh water entering the oceans might disrupt flow of the Gulf Stream, thus throwing Europe in the deep freeze.  The article ran in today's Observer, paired with  urlLink this  little article debunking global warming critics.  So much more refreshing than NPR's coverage of global warming which consistently states that "scientists disagree about global warming."  As one wag wrote in, "Yeah, and voters disagree about whether or not Ralph Nader should be our next President."

      I've been an infrequent blogger of late, as infrequent as a Piedmont thunderstorm.  I wonder if my blogging drought and the atmospheric drought are related?  Even though it's May our lawn is brown and crunchy.  Temperatures have topped 90 this week.  I'm having to water my tomatoes with Salisbury's finest chlorinated H2O.    These conditions are not unheard of for this time of year in North Carolina, but not really wanted or expected until July.  The heat's like those relatives who always arrive early for Christmas dinner.  You have to entertain them and finish cleaning the house, and you wind up doing a poor job of both.   Mutatis mutandis --there's a million things on my to-do list ahead of watering the garden, but there you go...  The rain is tantalizingly close.  A front is draped over the Ohio Valley.  Every night this week the mountains have been pounded with storms and the valleys inundated with flash floods.  But it never makes it down here to Rowan County.  We have a weather radio in our bedroom to awaken us in the event of severe weather.  When you're jarred awake at 3:30 AM to the news of a flood warning in some high country county up I-77, and you know that outside it's that awful combination of muggy air but dry skies, you want to throw something.

      In the mail yesterday came for me an autographed photo of President Bush and the First Lady thanking me for my support.  Also included was a letter from Governor Racicot inviting me to get on the winning team with a generous donation to the President's re-election war chest.  Ha, ha, ha.  I knew exactly what to do with this kind of junk mail.  I chopped the letter up into pieces, deposited the scraps in the postage free return envelope and dropped it in the mailbox.  Then I clicked on the Kerry button on the sidebar at this blog and made a modest donation.  Between my contribution to the Kerry campaign and the sabatoged envelope I figure I closed the gap between each candidate's funds by $25 and, say, $.07.  "We knew he was tricksey," they'll say when they open my envelope.  "We knew he was false..."

      I did something to the sidebar, so that now, whenever I look at the blog on my home computer, all the stuff is smushed to the bottom.  But it still looks fine on my work computer.  Weird.    At any rate, the side bar needs refreshing, so I've struck the polls.  Most people do think that dispensationalism is a heresy, although several people don't know what it is.  I'll leave it to Jonathan to write up a Dispensationalism 101 post.  As for the other poll, I'm glad that our readers see Eowyn's fearlessness, blondness and petiteness as definitely more sexy than the Elf-chick who's rather useless except for shedding an artful tear from time to time.  Oh, she did raise Aragorn from the dead, but that wasn't in the book.  Why'd they stick that in The Two Towers anyway?  Just so you wouldn't forget about her by the time she gets hitched in The Return of the King?  I'm even more pleased that Galadriel got two votes.  I admit to having a little crush on Cate Blanchett.  New polls are to the right.  Cast your vote today!

      We do not need to  urlLink go to the Security Council  to establish a War Crimes Tribunal to investigate ourselves.  Scott Horton was on Now with Bill Moyers tonight.  Horton is the New York attorney who, accordng to Sy Hersh's piece, was approached by JAGs worried that senior Pentagon officials were dismantling the Geneva Conventions.  Horton says that the Conventions are the law of the land, and any U.S. soldier or politician who violates them can be tried for War Crimes in U.S. courts.  Horton reinforces the picture emerging from Hersh's investigations and Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff that the torture at Abu Ghraib is the end result of decisions made at the highest levels of the Bush administration to evade the clear mandates of the Geneva Conventions.  Horton used words such as "shocking," "breathtaking," and "ignorant" to describe the attempts at the highest levels of this administration to undermine statutes that have distinguished us from the worst totalitarian regimes.    I'm too tired and too angry to write much more.  I would simply say, Please read Hersh's New Yorker  urlLink article , and read the  urlLink Newsweek piece  too, and write your Congressmen and beg them not to be satisfied with courts martial of a few bad apples.  They have destroyed much that is good about this country.  And in such a short amount of time.  How did it come to this?

      No, I am not talking about the Constitution of the United States.  I am talking about the Constitution of the United Methodist Church.  The current 2004 edition of our Social Principles' statement on war, as well as the 2000 edition of the same paragraph on war are unconstitutional with respect to the United Methodist Constitution.  Judicial Council - I hope you are listening!  Get your mind off homosexuality just for one second and think about war.  Our restrictive rules say that our doctrinal standards cannot be tampered with, and that they are the Articles of Religion of the Methodist Church and the Confession of Faith of the Evangelical United Bretheren Church.  Our Articles of Religion and Confession of fatih are not merely "guidance" as our Social Principles.  Any clergy or lay person who disseminates doctrines contrary to our doctrinal standards can be brought to trial - oh, how I would love for someone to be brought to trial over the issue of war rather than homosexuality....  Anyway, our EUB Confession of Faith (article XVI) states, "We believe war and bloodshed are contrary to the gospel and spirit of Christ."  There are no ifs, ands or buts.  It just flatly says that war and bloodshed are contrary to the gospel.  It doesn't say, "except in cases of ......."  It just makes a blanket statement.  Yes, believe it or not, pacifism is the official stance of the UMC - it slipped in through the back door via the Evangelical United Bretherens.    Now that is dogma, protected by the restrictive rule.  It pulls rank on any other part of the Discipline, such as the Social Principles.  Before 2000, our social principles were constitutional- that is, they were in line with our dogma.  But in 2000, J. Philip Wogaman, the dean of Protestant liberalism, started tampering with them, and he tried to do so again in 2004.  Our current Social Principles and those of 2000 contradict our doctrinal standards (because they allow for Christian participation in war), and therefore SHOULD BE THROWN OUT of the Discipline BY OUR JUDICIAL COUNCIL !!!

       .   Since when does being progressive mean that you have to be in favor of a woman's "right" to an abortion?  I don't know how we came to that assumption, but I'm glad  urlLink Sojourners  is questioning it.    There are many things in the world that I'll never understand.  One is why most people opposed to war seem to view abortion as a morally neutral private choice.  Another is why most people opposed to abortion are generally in favor of war and capital punishment.  At least they seem to be portrayed that way in the media.  Maybe' that's the problem: the media likes to divide things up in neat categories so that opposing sides can scream at each other across the room.  Maybe if the media admitted that it wasn't that simple, they wouldn't sell as many newspapers?  Suppose the media admitted that there actually were people who opposed war AND abortion.  That would require them to let go of many of their cherished assumptions, and they would actually have to THINK as they were reporting.  As it stands now, the media doesn't have to think any new creative thoughts.  They just keep running the same old stories over and over again, just changing the names and a few other blanks in the story, but the plot is always the same: conservatives and liberals oppose each other.  I get tired of that same old plot in news stories.

      "I think they ought to look at us as a country that understands freedom, where it doesn't matter who you are or how you're raised or where you're from, that you can succeed. I don't think they ought to look at us with envy. It really depends upon how (the) nation conducts itself in foreign policy. If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us. If we're a humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us. And our nation stands alone right now in the world in terms of power. And that's why we've got to be humble and yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom. So I don't think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are. We're a freedom-loving nation. And if we're an arrogant nation, they'll view us that way, but if we're a humble nation, they'll respect us."   Who said it?  George W. Bush   Oct. 11, 2000 Presidential Debate  Amazing, huh?  What happened?  9/11 happened.  When one becomes a vicitm, suddenly, one thinks that anything one does is ok, because, after all, one is a victim.    No one is more dangerous than a victim.  Of course, that anaylysis is only partially true, since the plan to invade Iraq was put on the table by Wolfowitz long before 9/11.  But 9/11 changed the perception of Wolfowitz's proposal from crazy to reasonable.

      I know that gas is expensive.  I'm also voting for Kerry this fall.  But I won't support him bashing Bush on this issue.  Tapping the strategic petroleum reserve just to depress prices is silly.  The reserve is for emergencies.  An OPEC boycott is an emergency.  An atomic bomb going off in the Middle East (or anywhere for that matter) is an emergency.  Marvin shelling out $1.82 per gallon is not an emergency.  Even Joe Blow in San Diego coughing up $2.39 per gallon is not an emergency, but I hate it for him.  Kerry has called for streamlining rules on gas additives as a way to reduce prices.  That probably makes sense.  But making this a campaign issue is quite unreasonable.  It makes populism look like hucksterism.  Look, if you're driving an Expedition or a Suburban into work from the burbs every day, you don't need John Kerry fighting for you.  You need to unload your personal climate change device and buy a real car.  Something cheap that gets you from point A to point B efficiently.  I know that high gas prices can be bad for the economy overall.  Locally, everyone's holding their breath over U.S. Airways filing (again) for bancrupcy.  This time they may not make it out.  High fuel prices are killing them.  If U.S. Airways goes belly-up because of expensive jet fuel, then a lot of people will suffer.  On the other hand, a sustained period of high energy prices is probably the only thing that will move us off the greenhouse effect dime.  Everyone knows the earth is heating up.  Everyone knows that burning fossil fuels is the chief culprit.  But we won't do anything about it until we have to.  $2.39 for regular unleaded might be what it takes to save the glaciers, to say nothing of the Outer Banks, or New Orleans.

      I'm on vacation this week.  Thus the inactivity at The Ivy Bush.  Know what we're doing?  Painting the trim on our windows.  We really know how to live it up!  However, the vacation does involve a brief getaway to the eastern shore of Mobile Bay where I will officiate at the wedding ceremony of Lattie's sister-in-law.  Ah, the eastern shore, whre they know more ways to cook fish than just slathering them in batter and frying them up!  With putty knife in hand, I've missed so many opportunities to comment on so many different topics.  Seymour Hersh, for instance.  First My Lai and now  urlLink Abu Ghraib .  When did he decide to grow up to be the best war coorespondent/investigative reporter in the world?  Is it really possible that  urlLink Tony Randall is dead ?  Can it possibly be true that he was eighty-four years old?  Perhaps I should put down my latest  urlLink Aubrey/Maturin novel  and rent  urlLink Pillow Talk  instead tonight.  Raise your hands out there if you're a weirdo like me and remember Randall more for his role in "Love Sidney" than "The Odd Couple."   urlLink President Bush or The Boss on September 2 ? I know who I'll be watching.

      With senior Pentagon officials admitting that U.S. military conduct at the Abu Ghraib prison  urlLink violates the Geneva Conventions , isn't it time we went to the Security Council to demand the U.N. establish a war crimes tribunal to investigate... us?

      Predictably, the National Council of Churches has called on the United Nations to take over postwar Iraq.  Predictably, the Southern Baptist Convention's Richard Land blames the Iraqi torture scandal on "moral relativism."  You can read more about it  urlLink here , but I'm warning you.  Prepare to be less than surprised at what these Christians are saying about Iraq.  Why doesn't the National Council of Churches step up to the plate and offer to take over Iraq instead of foisting this huge problem on the U.N.?  Let's sell off both their property on Riverside Drive and the offices of its member denominations.  That'll generate some revenue.  Ship the denominational bureaucrats and windbag clergy (including myself) to Iraq to replace the CPA.  Give our 18-26 year-old members some options:  Peace Corps, Christian Peacemaker Teams, etc., or go find another "church" to call home.  Why do "prophetic Christians" limit their mission to telling world governments what they ought to do instead of challenging Christians themselves with what we ought to do?  As for Mr. Land dragging out the moral relativism boogeyman, I'm not sure we can lay this scandal at the feet of that monster.  As I mentioned in the previous post, the soldiers at Abu Ghraib seem rather traditional and absolutist in their disdain for homosexuailty.  I can't imagine any of these jokers fitting in at some "open and affirming" United Church of Christ congregation where the liberal preacher showers moral equivocations on his bleeding heart parishioners.  Nosiree, when Land, Cal Thomas and other wingnuts condemn homosexuailty, they can count on a chorus of Amens from the very soldiers who are now facing courts martial.  The NCC and the SBC.  It doesn't matter what the problem is; they'll always come up with the same, threadbare "solutions."

      I've figured out how to solve this whole Iraqi prison abuse situation.  Much of the abuse was of a homosexual nature--piling naked men one on top of the other, sodomizing men with... well, you've read the newspaper, etc., etc.  This abuse is so powerful because it plays on both perpetrator and victim's abhorrence of homosexuality.  Solution?  Drop the ban on gays in the military, and actively recruit gay men to serve as MPs and Military Intelligence personnel.  It would not occur to gay men, who see nothing inherently shameful in homosexuality, to try to humiliate POWs by forcing them into such poses, now would it?  As for the murders, well, give me some more time...  Hey, I've got it, a paperback copy of the Geneva Conventions?

      The backlash has begun.  At yesterday's hearings on torture at the Abu Ghraib prison, Oklahoma Republican Senator Inhofe  urlLink expressed  more outrage at the outrage over the torture than the torture itself.    The sadistic murder of Nick Berg will surely fuel the backlash.  I imagine that callers are flooding right-wing AM radio shows today crying, "Why's everyone getting so worked up over what our soldiers did when terrorists are beheading our people?"  Not that Berg's killing was really needed.  The ingredients for a backlash were already there.  In  urlLink March  I alerted readers of this blog to allegations of mistreatment of Iraqi POWs, and invited readers to fast and pray for their well-being.  Readers responded scornfully, not only to the idea that U.S. soldiers might be torturing prisoners, but to the very idea of praying and fasting for the well-being of POWs.  I can't help but notice that those readers haven't commented much since the abuse scandal broke.    Also, on May 9, before the Berg video surfaced, The Charlotte Observer ran  urlLink this article  reporting that after 9/11 Americans are more accepting of torture. Not only has the horrific violence of that date hardened the hearts of the public, but commentators such as Alan Dershowitz have aided and abetted this change in attitude by endorsing torture in certain cases.  At an intellctual level the backlash is easy to refute.  Senator Inhofe thinks that the ones who got tortured had it coming to them because they were in cell blocks reserved for the worst of the worst.  Yet human rights organizations report that a high percentage of prisoners at Abu Ghraib were innocents caught up in U.S. military dragnets.  As for the contrast between the Abu Ghraib torture and the murder of Mr. Berg, well, we are setting the bar quite low when we celebrate the fact that our sense of human decency restrains us from chopping off people's heads.  "America, it's better than the Reign of Terror" is not a slogan that will win the hearts and minds of the peoples of the world to whom we want to bring capitalism and democracy.  Mr. Dershowitz ought to know that torture is an ineffective means of interrogation because the prisoner will say anything, true or false, in order to end the torture.  The torturers know that.  Torture is not a means to an end.  It's dehumanizing of individuals is an end unto itself.    But all the rational arguments in the world, even the arguments of thoughtful conservatives like  urlLink George Will , will not persuade people with infantile morality.  You know who I'm talking about.  People who believe that two wrongs do make a right.  People who are stuck in that fifth grade universe who, when confronted with wrongdoing, try their best to change the subject--"But look at what Billy did!  He stole my pencil!"  People who lack self-awareness and the daily disciplines of soul-searching and  repentance (not just for individual sins, but for collective ones as well).  For these simple-minded people, criticizing torture means endorsing terrorism.  I'm afraid that there are a lot of people out there like that, and I'm afraid that they vote.

      If you are not a U.M., please humor me while I indulge in some Methodist mullings.  It could be applicable to other denominations as well.  I don't know about you, but when I heard the rumors Thursday about the proposed dissolution of the UMC, I had to reach for the Pepto-Bismol. It literally made my stomach sick.  This post is dedicated to the Rev. Bill McAlilly of Tupello, Mississippi, a strange person who spoke a word of truth and reason on the floor of General Conference!  When the proposal for unity was read, Bill McAlilly rose to the occasion and spoke up for the ''the Methodist middle."  ''This group includes women, men, children, youth, lay, and clergy," McAlilly said. ''We teach Sunday school. We serve in food pantries," he said.  Too often, he said, moderates were silent. ''Perhaps that is our sin," he said. ''If those of us in the middle can contain those on both sides of the equation, we might be able to find the unity for which we seek."  It is strange for me to think of myself as part of "the Methodist Middle." I am such a radical in some ways. Like the MFSA, I am opposed to war, capital punishment, and the continued economic and social oppression and humiliation of the poor and marginalized. I am greatly disturbed when I think about all the moral support Christians have given our government to wage war against Iraq.   I was proud of our general board of church and society for opposing the senseless and destructive war against Iraq.  Yet, like the Confessing Movement, I have a passion for our Wesleyan doctrinal heritage. It also disturbs me to hear of a bishop openly rejecting such normative doctrines as Trinity, virgin birth, atonement, resurrection, etc...  I join conservatives in calling for our general board of church and society to withdraw from the religious coalition for reproductive choice.  What to do? Are you tired of liberals  urlLink defying   the Discipline in favor of their own private opinions? Are you tired of conservatives making  urlLink plans  to dissolve our denomination so that they won't have to be in fellowship with those with whom they disagree? If so, you may be part of the Methodist Middle!  What should we do? Organize another unofficial caucus? With Bill McAlilly as our president? Establish a web site? Print up stationery? Start hosting lunches at annual conference? Publish a petition to let  urlLink MFSA  and  urlLink Confessing Movement  slug it out on an island and leave the rest of us alone while we get on with the business of making disciples?   One part of me says, "the last thing we need is another unofficial caucus." Another part says, "If the Methodist Middle doesn't do something, we won't have a UMC to be in the middle of."  Below is a great response I received to this post:   I think the UMC middle should focus its energy on being the church and not follow the lead of the extremes.   To me, the most horrible thing about GC is there was too much attn to things that divide and not enough about what unifies. What difference does sexuality, etc matter in the grand scheme of things when prisoners are tortured, children starve, disease is prevalent, war rages, human rights are ignored, etc. I think Jesus cares more about the latter than the former. What do we want to be known for as a church and what do we want the papers to say about us?  If the middles lead the way and get the extremes to focus with us on these issues, we will all be too busy to worry about the other. Perhaps this is a bit naïve but I don't think fighting fire with fire is the answer. I will continue to ponder and look forward to discussion.

         There's more to Salisbury than meets the eye.  Two liberal arts colleges, a community college, a theological seminary, three corporate headquarters AND the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Hall of Fame.  All in a town of 30,000 people!  Sports reporters come to Salisbury from all over the United States for its annual awards banquet.  Well known celebrities like Bob Costas and Frank Deford, and lesser known writers and broadcasters.  Imagine Sven, pasty, rotund high school hockey coorespondent for a newspaper in Duluth, showing up in Salisbury in early May, the trees leafy green and the irises and roses in full bloom.  No wonder they come back year after year!  I wish I'd attended this year's awards banquest.  Joe Garigiola was inducted into the Hall of Fame.  My memories of Joe go back to the early 80s when he did color commentary for NBC's Major League Baseball Game of the Week.  (Some of you surely have longer memories than that).  This was before sports were wall-to-wall on cable, before greedy owners and players killed the World Series, probably before steroids, but certainly not before cocaine, in short, the salad days.  I looked forward to Saturday afternoons and Joe's hilarious commentary and frightening reminicenses about catching knuckle-ballers.  I have a soft spot for Joe for another reason.  At age 78, Garagiola is the spitting image of my dad, who would be 81 if he'd lived.  So it was good to see Dad, er, Joe,in the Salisbury Post this week.  Congratulations Joe.

      You know the stereotype.  The right is a beacon of moral clarity.  The left is a swamp of moral relativism.  The right sees the world in black and white.  The left sees only shades of gray.  The right stands up for timeless truths.  The left is a quivering mass of ethical equivocation.  So the moral gymnastics that the right wing punditry are performing in light of the Iraqi prison abuse scandal are truly bracing.  I've already noted Cal Thomas' breezy dismissal of the Geneva Convention and the Uniform Code of Military Justice as mere " urlLink rules of etiquette ."  Charles Krauthammer has written a more forceful denunciation of the POW abuse  urlLink here , but strangely enough, he leads with a description of Arab paranoia about loose Western women.  Why can't the right wing pundits simply say "Torturing POWs is wrong, evil and reprehensible, and those responsible, both the perpetrators and those in the chain of command who allowed this environment to develop, should be punished to the fullest extent of the law."  Why do they have to provide "helpful context" which mitigates the seriousness of the crimes?  Krauthammer says in effect, "The prison abuse wouldn't be so bad if the Arabs didn't hang on to such weird stereotypes about Western morality."  Uh, No.  The prison abuse is evil, quite apart from what anybody thinks about our culture, and quite apart from how Iraqi insurgents are prosecuting the war against Coalition forces.  Cal and Charles, welcome to the grey world of moral ambiguity.

       urlLink John-Paul's blog  maintains informal surveilance of David Brooks.  Against my better judgment, this blog is turning into a Cal Thomas Watch.  I shouldn't read Cal first thing in the morning.  He sours the milk in my Cheerios and generally ruins my day.   urlLink This latest column  is no exception.  Cal takes one paragraph to say that U.S. soldiers who torture POWs ought to be punished, and then devotes the rest of the column to saying that the abuse is no big deal.  Contradictions abound.  On the one hand, "War is nasty business, and the rules don't always comport with a book of etiquette."  On the other hand, "The difference between alleged American mishandling of prisoners and what Saddam did is that the American incidents are contrary to regulations and the rules of war to which the United States subscribes."  I think that in Brother Cal's mind there's only two rules of war:  "Being a Christian nation entitles you to be as brutal as you want to be."  And, "Being a non-Christian nation means that we get to vilify you for your brutality."  Brother Cal writes that no matter how far we bend over backwards to be good, "such people" (Arabs?  Terrorists?) will hate us anyway.  But when we launched this war over a year ago, the administration told us that "such people" yearned to breathe free and talk on cell phones, if only we would give them the opportunity by removing the dictator Saddam.  Again we see the love-hate relationship that the right has with the people it says it wants to liberate.  I've already said that it's sort of like the relationship a batterer has with his wife/girlfriend.  So many professions of love, but when something goes wrong, look out!  Or maybe there's a different explanation.  Perhaps the Neocons running the government really are idealistic about the ability of U.S. military power to spread democracy in the Middle East, but they've been unable to craft a plan that can bear the weight of their idealism.  Brother Cal, on the other hand, is no Neocon elitist.  He speaks for the God and country types who vilify Islam and Arabs around water coolers and in Sunday School classrooms in the Bible Belt.  They aren't on board with Bush's neo-Wilsonian foreign policy.  They're for killing and punishing people not like us.  To the extent that their hatreds line up with the administration's ambitions, they're on board with the President.

      All of the sudden, the draft is everywhere.  In today's Observer,  urlLink Walter Williams  comes out against the draft, and  urlLink Act for Change  urges me to email my representative and ask him to oppose the draft.  Williams is a libertarian, an economist and a guest host for Rush Limbaugh.  His shtick is evaluating political and social issues in strictly economic terms to show how counterproductive and irrational liberal solutions are.  He argues that a draft would actually make wars more likely because it would force down the cost of war (soldier wages).  This sounds plausible, but is quite misleading because Williams' argument does not account for the non-monetary costs of war.  Williams forgets about the high political cost of waging war when the brunt of the casualties might be borne by the children of the nation's elites.  Here, as usual, Williams shows himself to be the victim of seriously deficient and reductionistic thinking.  Act for Change is opposed to a draft because we aren't in total war situation like World War II, and because they say that the best way to alleviate the burden on the military is to craft a plan to get us out of Iraq as soon as possible.  Being a budding pacifist, I have a hard time formulating an opinion on the draft.  Forcing people to carry a gun seems barbaric to me.  But would a draft make it politically harder to wage war?  That's appealing.  Maybe this is an issue that being a pacifist frees me from having to have an opinion on.

       urlLink This  is one of Bill's more incoherent columns.  The U.N. bashing in the first few paragraphs does not, in my opinion, lead into the point of the last paragraphs of the column, namely:  we've led the Iraqi horse to the waters of democracy.  If only they'd drink of it!  In fact, Safire's op-ed piece is riddled with contradictions.  He wrings his hands over the Marine turnover of Fallujah to an Baathist general.  Then he turns right around and speculates that said turnover might be just the incentive the Shias need to reign in the firebrand al Sadr.  Lashing out and wishful thinking and incoherence.  It's ugly watching the right wing punditry fuss and fume as their grand project collapses.  And it's infuriating watching them try to lay the blame for this debacle at the feet of the Iraqis.  It is not the case that we've given them some great chance for democracy.  We have rounded up their young men, denied them due process, tortured them, over-reacted to yellow journalism like al Sadr's, thus resulting in the deaths of scores of U.S. soldiers and hundreds of Iraqis, failed to secure their borders and control looting.  No wonder Iraqis are shooting at us.  Iraq is a mess, and it's no one's fault but the White House.

      Leave it to  urlLink Captain Jack Aubrey  of all people to expose the inherent contradictions in the profession known as "military chaplaincy":  "I will tell you what," Jack said heavily.  "I respect the cloth, of course, and learning; but I cannot feel that a man-of-war is the proper place for a parson.  Just take this morning... On Sunday when we rig church, I dare say he will tell us to treat one another like brethren, and to do unto others, you know.  We will all say Amen, and the  Leopard  will sail on with all those people in irons in that filthy hole forward, just the same.  But that is only what occurred to me this morning:  in a larger way it seems uncommon odd, and precious near to cant, to tell the ship's company of a man-of-war with loaded guns to love your enemy and turn the cheek, when you know damned well that the ship and every man jack aboard her is there to blow the enemy out of the water if he possibly can.  Either the hands believe it, and then where is your discipline?  Or they don't, and then it seems to me to come hellfire close to mockery of holy things.  I prefer reading them the Articles of War or giving them a piece about their duty:  coming from me, with no bands or surplice on, why, it has another effect." from  urlLink Desolation Island , by Patrick O'Brian.

      Normal people fantasize about sex.  Pundits fantasize about politics.  Lately the pundits have been dreaming up some pretty kinky stuff.  Take  urlLink Cal Thomas .  He sees--Ooh baby--Hillary Clinton emerging from a smoke-filled room in Boston wearing nothing but a sash with the words "Democratic nominee" stitched on it.  All because Brother Cal read a column by some unhappy liberal grumbling about John Kerry.  You don't need to be Sigmund Freud to interpret this dream.  Republicans were so pumped about running against Howard Dean.  Then the Democrats had the audacity to not throw themselves over a cliff.  They nominated John Kerry instead.  Now Kerry is a "Massachusetts librul," but the GOP punditry has had a harder time giving themselves over to unabashed Kerry-hatred if the Democrats had anointed Dean.  After all, Kerry's a war hero, and Republicans know it, even as the more scurrilous among them slander his war record.  Since Super Tuesday Brother Cal and his ilk have been suffering from  coitus politicus interruptus .  So they fantasize about campaigning against the one they hate most of all, "Ms. Rodham Clinton."   urlLink Clarence Page  hopes that Colin Powell will complete the all-male review on the stage in Boston.  There's something about the man that makes liberal hearts go pitter-patter, even though he stiffed Bill Clinton when Clinton needed a new Secretary of State, even though he failed to prevent this disastrous war, even though he, in all probability, knew the case for war was a sham, yet closed the deal anyway with his tour-de-force before the Security Council.  Colin Powell?  Tall, dark and handsome Yes, but Vice-President?  Only if we go back to the days when the Vice Presidency was a job that, in the words of one of FDR's VP's, "isn't worth a bucket of warm spit."  I'm not sure whether men view pornography because they're bored with their spouses, or if they're bored with their spouses because they view pornography.  Likewise, I don't know if the pundits are bored with the Kerry/Gephardt,Edwards,Richardson ticket because they fantasize about implausible political scenarios, or if they fantasize about implausible political scenarios because they find Kerry/Gephardt, Edwards, Richardson so boring.  Either way, it's time these men stopped living in a fantasy world.

      Yesterday's Supreme Court ruling was not "a blow to President Bush's war on terrorism" as  urlLink this AP article  puts it.  (Just where is this liberal media I keep hearing about, anyway?)  It was a blow for common sense.  It was a clear and simple reassertion of basic Constitutional rights.  Of course people accused of crimes are entitled to their day in court, even if the crime is terrorism.  Of course the Executive Branch cannot deny U.S. citizens access to legal counsel, even when they're accused of waging war against the United States.  Anyone who didn't sleep through Civics class knows this.  Even the ones who did but who watch crime shows on TV know this. Everybody knows this.  The fact that it took a Supreme Court ruling to convince the Bush administration shows how long and dark the rabbit hole is that we have fallen down over the last three years.  "A state of war is not a blank check for the president when it comes to the rights of the nation's citizens," wrote Justice O'Conner.  Of course not.

Sure you can read the Times online, but how much better to have the gray lady in your lap while the Atlantic Ocean laps at your toes!  Last Sunday's front page featured a disturbing article on a growing eugenics subculture.  Some couples are electing to abort their unborn children after genetic testing reveals a high probability of birth defects.  Down's Syndrome, Cystic Fibrosis, dwarfism, you name it.  The tests are good enough to identify myriads of disabilities in utero, just in time to snuff out a demanding life before it ever gets started.  The moral reasoning of the couples interviewed is breathtaking.  (Sorry, no link to the article as seven days have elapsed, but  urlLink here  is a link to letters-to-the-editor regarding the article).  One couple said that the quality of life of a Down's child and the family would be too "severely compromised."  One woman aborted a CF fetus because her husband squirms when watching violent movies, and she just knew that having such a child would break up their marriage.  Yet another couple aborted a child with severe physical and mental disabilities after taking into consideration the quality of life of the family.  It's hard not to take this sort of thing personally.  I have a son who's autistic.  He attends a special education class with a Down's Syndrome classmate.  He played baseball in our local Challenger League with wheelchair-bound children, and one big kid who just wondered around the outfield during most games.  Laura has two young cousins with CF.  All of these children make high demands on their parents, and it's worth it.  None of them may live long enough or may aspire to become an  urlLink Energy Trading Company CEO , a  urlLink pop superstar  or the  urlLink Vice President  of the United States, but does that mean they will have a low quality of life?  You can have your "quality of life."  The article did include an interview with a couple who decided against genetic testing.  I'm supposed to read all these accounts, nod my head gravely and ponder the magnitude of the moral quandaries our technology imposes upon us.  I am supposed to soberly give thanks that we entrust these profound moral decisions to the persons involved--that everyone's "choice" must be regarded as ultimately sovereign.  Except that freedom of choice might not last forever.  In the book  urlLink The Future of the Disabled in Liberal Society , ethicist Hans Reinders warns that genetic testing, ready access to abortion and liberal (in the classical sense of the word) notions about human personhood may create a perfect storm for the disabled and their families in the next generation.    Reinders notes that individual freedom and choice is the sine qua none for individual personhood.  But these attributes do not apply to the severely disabled.  They are examples of "human non-persons, members of the human species but do not in and of themselves have standing in the moral community."  To be sure, advocates for the disabled have appealed to the individual rights to protect the handicapped from discrimination, but the very notion of individual liberty may work against the disabled in the near future when it becomes a real question whether or not people who can't act on their freedoms should exist at all.  Reinders foresees parents who "choose" (there's that word again) to bring such children into the world as subject to ridicule if not outright punishment.  In the future the eugenics subculture may be the dominant culture.  There's a shocking degree of laziness on the part of these people who cannot bear to raise a disabled child.  Of course none of us are up to parenthood, even if the child has all his or her fingers and toes and all of the chromosomes in the right order, but God gives us the grace to bear burdens that we alone cannot bear.  And those burdens are worth bearing.  They make us better people than we were had we never taken them up.  Were it not for my autistic son, my commitment to Christian non-violence would still be rather intellectual, confined to criticizing war in sermons, in print and in the blogosphere.  As it is, living with a child who's more prone to violent behavior than most, I've learned just how violent I am, and how hard it is to live nonviolently.  If you want a "happy" life, then I suppose you ought to abort your disabled fetus, leave your spouse when he/she no longer satisfies, and surround yourself with friends who will never tell you what's really on their minds.  But if  urlLink you want to be healed , then it's worth having some difficult people making demands on you from time to time.

      Here is a piece I wrote for the newsletter of my local church:  This year the 4th of July falls on a Sunday.  How shall we mark the day?  What is our calling as Christians who live in the United States?  Certainly, we feel gratitude for living in a country that allows us certain freedoms: the freedom of religion, freedom of speech, the freedom to protest our government, the freedom to vote, and a host of other freedoms.  We are also proud of our troops who have sacrificed so much for our country.  But on this Sunday, as every Sunday, the church gathers to pledge loyalty to our primary allegiance: the kingdom of God.   As I said last year in my series of sermons on the Apostles’ Creed: the creed is the way we pledge allegiance to God.   Much like school children begin every school day by pledging allegiance to the American flag, we begin every worship service with our pledge of allegiance – the Apostles’ Creed.  Our allegiance to God above all other powers and principalities can put us in tension with our surrounding culture.  This tension has led many Christians (including myself) to think of the church as a colony of “resident aliens,” who live in one culture, but maintain our citizenship in another.  “Our citizenship is in heaven” Paul tells us in Philippians 3:20.  As I reflect on the way we Christian resident aliens mark July 4th, I have more questions than answers: How do we respond to Jesus’ statement, “Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and unto God the things that are God’s?”  How do we show appropriate honor, respect, and love for our country without degenerating into nationalistic jingoism?  Our United Methodist Social Principles (2004) state, “We believe war is incompatible with the teachings and example of Christ.  We therefore reject war as an instrument of foreign policy, to be employed only as a last resort in the prevention of such evils as genocide, brutal suppression of human rights, and unprovoked international aggression.”  How do we understand this statement from the Discipline in light of our country’s recent history of pre-emptive warfare?  How do we show our love and support to our brave service men and women who are fighting wars and also maintain our fidelity to the example and teachings of Jesus about loving our enemies?  If and when there is a conflict between our loyalty to Christ and loyalty to our nation, how do we make clear that remaining faithful to Jesus Christ is our highest priority?  There are at least two possible ways to resolve the tensions expressed in these difficult questions.  One way is to collapse the tension in favor of “our country, right or wrong.”  Our faith would then become a tool for our nation to use to support its policies when it was convenient.  Another possible solution would be for us to cling to our Christian identity and disregard the claims put on us by our local, state, and national authorities.  I, for one, would be unhappy with collapsing this tension in either direction.  To be “resident” but also “alien” means that we must live with the tension creatively, carefully, and faithfully.  One thing I do know: the best way to deal with this tension is through prayer.  Through prayer, we orient ourselves to the God who loves us and has given himself for us.  That’s why, I think, the best way for us resident aliens to mark July 4th this year is to pray the “Prayer for our Country” that is found in our United Methodist hymnal:  “O God, keep our whole country under your protection.  Wipe out sin from this land; lift it up from the depth of sorrow, O Lord, our shining light.  Save us from deep grief and misfortune, Lord of all nations.  Bless us with your wisdom, so that the poor may not be oppressed and the rich may not be oppressors.  Make this a nation having no ruler except God, a nation having no authority but that of Love.  Amen.”   (United Methodist Hymnal # 429)  Peace,  Jonathan

      The preacher is Adam Hamilton, probably the best known United Methodist pastor in the country, and the pastor of the fastest-growing United Methodist Church in the country.  This sermon presents the pro-choice position as clearly, sympathetically, and compellingly as possible.  It then presents the pro-life side as simply, honestly, and sincerely as possible.  The preacher presents the best points about both sides and treats both positions with great respect.   Then he tells you a story that will absolutely blow you away.    This sermon does not address the legal issues; it does not even touch on whether or not Roe V Wade should be overturned.  No matter what you may think about abortion, this sermon will stay with you...   urlLink http://www.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&mid=4759

      In this Orwellian, post-9/11 world, War is Peace, freedom is slavery, anti-torture laws give the President the right to torture and now,  urlLink parking lots are good for the environment .  The Lowes Motor Speedway wanted to build a new parking lot.  The city let them, provided they retained a tree buffer around the perimeter of the site.  They Speedway agreed, but when nobody used the lot after a race, they bulldozed the trees so everybody would see it and park there.  When called on it, speedway officials reacted with everything from doublespeak to bullying.  They say that cutting the trees is good for the environment because added use of the lot enabled traffic to clear faster.  Specious.  What about the 360some days out of the year when there are no races?  Those trees could be cleaning the air and holding valuable topsoil in place all that time.  It seems like better signage and no bulldozing would have been a sounder solution.  The bozo who manages the speedway's real estate threatened to take the city to court, or to the court of public opinion if the city tries to make them replace trees.  "If they come back with something Machiavellian like that, we may have to go to court.  Or Bruton Smith will go to the press and say, 'Look how stupid this is.'"  Aside from the tortured (I can't help but use that word) use of the word "Machiavellian" (I mean really, are we to believe this clown has actually read The Prince?), what comes across loud and clear is contempt for the law.  They flouted the rules and are daring anybody to hold them accountable.  It's worth clicking on the link to get the full force of the man's disdain for the city and for the environment.  I know better than to begin to talk to people like this about the wildlife that are displaced by bulldozing forests, the aesthetic value of woodlands, about Joyce Kilmer's poem, etc., etc., but I shake my head in deep sadness and anger at such a baldfaced display of, of... well I've already used the words contempt and disdain.  I just shake my head.    But we're laying to rest today a man who famously averred that "trees cause pollution," so what do you do?

      It's not just liberals who are appalled that Bush administration officials are ready to consign the Geneva Conventions to ash heap of history.  Lawyers in the U.S. military have fought the administration tooth and nail over relaxing the standards for our treatment of POWs.  They insist that we treat our prisoners well so that the enemy has no excuse to torture, abuse, neglect or humiliate our soldiers.  This is an application of the Golden Rule, "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you."  And the author of the Golden Rule?  None other than George W. Bush's  urlLink political mentor .  As a person with a commitment to Christian nonviolence, I can say in all sincerity that no one could better educate the President on the person and work of Jesus Christ than the soldiers under his command.

      My thermometer says 96 degrees, and it's in the shade, mounted to the north wall of my house.  I was working in the yard this morning, not too hard, just some weeding, yet before long I had to wring out my shirt.  I would rather have stayed indoors, but the weeding had to happen as we are soon to depart on vacation.  I would hate to return to Bermuda grass marching across my garden, and other assorted weeds crowding out my tomatoes and cukes.  We have green tomatoes right now, and blossoms on the beans.  The corn hasn't tasseled.  I pulled the sugar snap peas and stripped them clean of pods.  The okra is a few inches high.  If only it'll rain while we're gone...  Since I'm taking a vacation, keeping this site going falls to my colleague Jonathan.  He's been quiet of late, off on vacation himself and off to this "Annual Conference" thing of which Methodists darkly speak.  May he warm your heart strangly while I'm on Ivy Bush hiatus.

      From the President's  urlLink news conference  yesterday:   Q: Mr. President, I wanted to return to the question of torture. What we've learned from these memos this week is that the Department of Justice lawyers and the Pentagon lawyers have essentially worked out a way that U.S. officials can torture detainees without running afoul of the law.   So when you say that you want the U.S. to adhere to international and U.S. laws, that's not very comforting. This is a moral question: Is torture ever justified?   BUSH: Look, I'm going to say it one more time. Maybe I can be more clear. The instructions went out to our people to adhere to law. That ought to comfort you.   We're a nation of law. We adhere to laws. We have laws on the books. You might look at these laws. And that might provide comfort for you. And those were the instructions from me to the government.   I know that our Chief Executive received more than his fair share of Gentleman's Cs at Yale.  I know that he can get tongue-tied from time to time.  But you would think that in response to a pretty straightforward question, "Is torture ever justified?"  he could give a straight answer, Texas-style.  Either Yesiree or Nosiree would do.  But he sidestepped the question.  In fact he begged the question.  He said he told people to obey the law, ignoring the reporter's observation that, according to the sophistry of his lawyers, torture isn't necessarily against the law.  Clearly the President knows that most people don't approve of torture.  Clearly, the President is of a different mind.  If it were not so, he would have answered the question directly.  The "comfort" he gave was false and cold.  It's a deliberate attempt to mislead the public by muddying the waters.  It's worth remembering that our President is the kind of man who wears his faith on his sleeve.  Jesus Christ is Bush's favorite political philosopher, remember?  Well Jesus Christ was tortured.  How can a man who says he worships the One whose resurrected body still bears the marks of nail prints equivocate on the morality of torture?  One of the ordination questions for Presbyterian deacons, elders and ministers asks, "Do you accept the scriptures of the Old and New Testaments to be, by the Holy Spirit, the unique and authoritative witness to Jesus Christ and God's word to you?"  I recently heard one of our candidates for ministry comment on this question.  He said, "This question means that you can't worship another Jesus other than the one you meet in scripture.  Jesus said and did a lot of things in the Bible that we have trouble with, but we can't posit some other Jesus out there who's easier to worship."  Which is exactly what George W. Bush has done.  I can't say that Bush is clueless about Jesus.  He credits faith in God with helping him beat his addiction(s), so there's some glimmer there.  But the President's concept of Jesus seems to begin and end with Paul's words in Philippians 4, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."  Bush's brand of Christianity is this weird combination of triumphalism and antinomianism that completely ignores the life and teachings of the man he purports to worship.  His is an withered  faith that isn't fleshed out by the guts of the New Testament.  You will say, perhaps, that there is a difference between torturing innocent people and torturing guilty people.  It's worth remembering that the detainees at Guantanamo Bay have no access to any court where a determination of guilt or innocence can be made.  Also note that most of the detainees at Abu Ghraib were innocents caught up in U.S. military dragnets.    I would add that nobody deserves to be tortured, even the guilty.  It is a crime against humanity.  The logic behind determining who is deserving and undeserving of torture is the logic of totalitarian regimes.  You remember the Communists, don't you?  The ones Ronald Reagan stood up against?  They didn't torture everybody, just the people they determined to be a threat to the state.  Welcome to their world of moral reasoning.

      Know what's the best-selling soft drink?  Coke.  How can you tell?  Because in its ads Pepsi always slams Coke, but Coke ads never mention Pepsi.  Now go to  urlLink George W. Bush's web site .   You'll see a little picture of the President, turned to the side.  You almost can't even see his face.  But you will see a big image of a scowling John Kerry matched with some misleading and highly negative statements.  Over at the  urlLink Kerry website , there's an image of the presumptive Democratic nominee looking presidential, but neither hide nor hair of the President himself.  And that's all you need to know about where this race is headed.

      I haven't heard a news update this morning, but to the best of my knowledge, another June day is passing without a Supreme Court ruling on the status of detainees in the War on Terror.  You'll recall, Dear Reader, that Ted Olsen tried to persuade the Supremes to let the Executive Branch create a moral and legal black hole at Gitmo where they would have exclusive power to hold and interrogate people without judicial oversight.  Meanwhile the torture memos have worked their way from page four of the Observer to  urlLink page three .  "Torture memos shock legal minds" reads the headline.  Do those legal minds include Justices O'Conner, Scalia and Kennedy?  Or are all three in such a state of mourning over the man that appointed them to their posts that they can't bear to read beyond  urlLink the photos on page one ?  If not, then the Bush plan to shred the separation of powers is moving forward quite nicely on multiple fronts.  No judicial oversight of detainees plus an audacious argument that the right to set aside laws is inherent in the presidency equals a federal government of one branch.  Nay, one household.  What I can't understand is why these guys also want to  urlLink replace Hamilton's image  on the ten dollar bill with Reagan's.  I mean, it was Hamilton who wanted a King and not a President.  Seems like in the brave new world of the House of Bush ruling America, we'd see more Hamilton, not less.

      It's clear now, a month after photos of American soldiers torturing Iraqi detainees hit the media, that this wasn't the work of a few knuckleheads.  We've read the leaked memo written by White House Counsel Alberto Gonzalez dismissing some requirements of the Geneva Conventions as "quaint."  We've  urlLink just now read  of White House lawyers making the specious argument that the President can order subordinates to violate anti-torture statues because, you know, he's the President.  Seymour Hersh reported in The New Yorker that the abuses at Abu Ghraib resulted from a decision at the highest levels of the Pentagon to expand the rough treatment regime applied to Al Qaeda detainees at Guantanamo Bay Cuba to Iraq.  A British national detained and later released from Gitmo has alleged sexual humiliation of prisoners there not unlike that which we've seen at Abu Ghraib.  Human rights agencies have sounded alarms about prisoner mistreatment and homicides in Afghanistan.  This scandal now extends over multiple continents and up and down the military and civilian chain of command.  There's no more hiding from these dreadful facts.   urlLink Mickey Kaus  and others who've argued that CBS erred in showing the abuse pictures couldn't be more wrong.  If it weren't for CBS and other media outlets, we'd still be under the impression that a few bad apples got a little out of hand over there.  Thanks to their courage, we know the truth.  Administration officials may well be guilty of war crimes.  Don't shoot the messenger, Mickey.  And I want to ask those of you out there who are still committed to voting for President Bush, Is this the kind of country you want to live in?  Do you want America to act like the totalitarian regimes of the past that we opposed?  Do you want America to become the very thing that we once hated?  Because a vote for George W. Bush is a vote for just that:  a vindication of barbarism and legal sophistry that threatens the very nature of our country.  Now I know that people vote for candidates for a variety of reasons.  If you're anti-tax and thus feel compelled to vote for Bush, why not vote  urlLink Libertarian  this fall?  If you're a cultural conservative and can't stand pulling the lever for that Massachusetts librul, there may yet be  urlLink another candidate  in the race for you beside the President.  You don't have to vote for Kerry.  But please, please, don't vote for torture and the end of the rule of law in our nation.

      I'll be glad when Ronald Reagan is buried.  Perhaps then the newspapers will put... news... on the front page.  A blurb I found on page four of today's Charlotte Observer should have been on page one with a VJ Day sized headline.  Some Bush administration lawyers wrote a paper last year arguing that the President has the authority to order subordinates to torture terrorist suspects.  Why?  Because the power to set aside laws is "inherent in the presidency."  Sorry, I can't link to it.  The Observer deems it unworthy of its web site.  I can, however, link to  urlLink Josh Marshall's commentary  on a much longer Wall Street Journal article on the same Bush administration legal contortions.  Now boys and girls, you'll remember from Civics class that the Executive Branch of government is supposed to enforce the laws.  You also know that sometimes it doesn't work that way.  Some Presidents break the law.  Bill Clinton, for instance.  (Yes, I'll readily concede that point.)  You know that usually this is done secretly; there's a coverup afterward, denials followed by non-apology apologies, a resignation perhaps, and then a book or an interview with David Frost or Barbara Walters, etc., etc.  What's unique about this situation is that we have lawyers trying to make the case that the President has the   right   to violate the law just because he's the President.  This is Louis XIV stuff.  This is mind-boggling.  Are we a government of laws or men?  Can the President of the world's oldest democracy rule by decree?  Our Republic is in grave danger.  This is our most perilous point since the summer of 1974 when, according to  urlLink Anthony Summers , Richard Nixon put out feelers to Admiral Zumwalt and the other Joint Chiefs about keeping him in power in the event he were impeached.  If there's another major terrorist attack on U.S. soil while this administration is in power, then what's argued in confidential briefs will be argued before the Supreme Court.  Sad to say, there'll probably be at least four if not five votes for this nonsense.  Saw a bumper sticker on the door of the head shop next to that restaurant where Ronald Reagan's picture is hanging:  If you aren't outraged you aren't paying attention.  Keep reading page four, man.  Pay attention!

      Any way you slice it, it wasn't Ronald Reagan.  Atrios reports that in 2003, Reagan was beat out in the "Best Presidents Ever" Gallup poll by Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy and, drum roll please, WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON.  Reagan's average job approval rating while in office trailed Clinton, George H. W. Bush and a slew of other Presidents.  Lastly his all-time high job approval rating, 68%, couldn't best Slick Willy's 71%.  Begin  urlLink here  and scroll down to see the data for yourself.  Now in Dwight Miller's American History class at Seventy-first High School in Fayetteville, North Carolina, it was a different story.  At the end of the year Mr. Miller polled the students on their top five Presidents.  I think I voted for Lincoln, TR, Woodrow Wilson, FDR and Reagan.  (I was a Republican in those days, but wasn't everybody?  I mean, how many states did the man carry in '84, like 48 or something?)    Anyway, Reagan came in second or third.  Mr. Miller stated, "I've been doing this poll for 30 years, and no sitting President has ever been as popular as Ronald Reagan.  Even JFK got very few votes until after he was assassinated."    Mr. Miller's poker face couldn't hide his disbelief.  I think he was an old school New Dealer.  Our's was a U.S. History class that actually made it all the way to the present, the present being 1986 when I took the class.  We had to memorize vocabulary words related to the epoch we were studying, and one of the last ones we learned was "Supply Side Economics."  "Also known as TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS," boomed Mr. Miller's voice.  We dutifully scribbled it down, but apparently we didn't get it.

      I ate diner with some friends last night at a Mexican restaurant in town.  Over our table were big posters of western movie stars, Clint Eastwood, Abbott and Costello wearing revolvers, and... Ronald Reagan.  I looked at Reagan's poster and thought, "He's had Alzheimer's for a long time now.  How much longer will he be with us?"  Ironic.  Reagan is the patron saint of modern conservatism, but his record is not politically orthodox.  Yes he cut taxes, but he also raised them.  Yes he took a hard lime against communism, but he also negotiated treaties with the Soviets that eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons.  Reagan was idealistic in rhetoric and pragmatic in practice.  He was, in other words, shrewd politician.  The "Morning in America" commercial embodied the style of Reagan's presidency.  People tolerate scolds in their preachers but not in their politicians.  Reagan always exuded optimism, even when he was hammering away at what he perceived to be the great evils of the day.  CBS tonight showed a brief clip of Reagan's debate with Jimmy Carter in 1980.  There was Carter, frowning at the camera, serious, determined, and just a little bit disappointed in you.  Reagan was smiling.  That's a lesson for all aspiring politicians of any party.  We will be treated to innumerable reminiscences about the 40th president in the next few days.  Hagiographies from the right, and demonizations from the left.  I've already said that Reagan's record was more complicated than his political persona might lead one to believe.  There are two places where I believe he made serious errors.  One is the Contra War.  Nicaragua was never a threat to the United States.  But Reagan waged a proxy war there to demonstrate his administration's resolve against communism.  The war did nothing to end communism or make the United States safer.  It simply added a new layer of suffering to an impoverished third world country.    Nicaragua is worth mentioning because the logic behind that escapade is at work today in Iraq.  Like Nicaragua, Iraq was no threat to the United States, but we went to war there to send a message that we were tough on terrorism.  Even the players are the same, Elliot Abrams, for instance.  And to date, our war has accomplished about as much as we did in Central America in the 80s.  The other issue is AIDS.  President Reagan did not say the word out loud in public until 1987.  He was AWOL when a brand new, communicable disease spread like wildfire through the populace.  A lot of people would be alive today had there been more determination from the top to stop AIDS in its tracks.  Alzheimer's Disease is a terrible way to die, not only for the patient, but for the family.  The people who knew Ronald Reagan personally will certainly miss him, but his death lifts a burden from them and from him.  And for that we can be thankful.

      My blog turned one yesterday.  You can read the original post  urlLink here .  Coming back from a wedding in Mobile, I'd have to add a reason to the ones I listed in my original post about why I started this blog.  My friend Lattie Collins has been dead for a year and a half now.  It was his sister-in-law's wedding we attended last weekend.  Lattie was my sounding board.  We talked weekly about politics, joys and frustrations of ministry, theology, personal ups and downs, you name it.  I have missed those conversations immensely, and I think I started this blog in part to recreate the sounding board that I lost when Lattie died.  Especially in the early days, before I added any links or a comment function, I think I was broadcasting my thoughts into the ether for Lattie to comment on.  Not that he has, and that's a good thing.  There's this story in the Bible about King Saul who, in a moment of extreme desperation, conjured up the spirit of his deceased mentor Samuel, seeking badly needed advice.   urlLink He didn't like what he heard .   We had a great time seeing Lattie's family.  His father-in-law introduced us to crawfish cheesecake.  No, really.  The stuff is delicious.  It went down well with the Tuchers he'd laid up for the rehearsal dinner.  Bavaria and the Bayou, two great tastes that taste great together.  But the trip also reminded just how much I miss him.  And that's OK.  I think it was Bonhoeffer who said that in this life, our tears are what keep us connected to the loved ones who've gone on from this life, and would we not want to remain connected to them?  Certainly we would.  Saw  urlLink Intolerable Cruelty  last night.  The Cohen brother's black humor will restore your faith in the human race far more than sentimental Hollywood pap like Love Actually.  Billy Bob Thornton turned up again, this time as an over-the-top Texas Awl Man.  Joel and Ethan's ability to create outrageous, bizarre and macabre characters is probably only exceeded by Flannery O'Conner's.

      In 1960 Christianity Today feared that the election of a Catholic President might put the government under the authority of the Pope.  What they feared 44 years ago they now earnestly hope for.   urlLink This Christianity Today editorial  asserts that the Catholic hierarchy is justified in denying communion to pro-choice Catholic politicians like John Kerry.  There is much that is commendable about the editorial.  They rightly argue that "conscience" is no refuge for those who would defy church authority.  Christians have an obligation to allow their consciences to be molded by scripture and tradition.  Over here in Presbyterianland, our Book of Order proclaims that "God alone is Lord of the conscience," yet also states that church officers have to exercise freedom of conscience "within certain bounds."  Granted, Kerry is not an "officer" in the Roman Catholic Church, but I suppose the Catholics are able to decide for themselves what's expected of the laity.  Alas, the editorial doesn't go far enough.  In passing, it notes that President Bush wouldn't even meet with the bishops of his own denomination who opposed the war in Iraq, but the full brunt of its critique falls on Senator Kerry.  Bob Woodward asked President Bush if he consulted his father about the war on Iraq, and Bush replied that he had a higher Father to which he was beholden.  This "Just Me and God" relationship that bypasses the wisdom of the saints seems just as much an example of the "hypermodern individualism" CT derides as Kerry's voting record on abortion.  Why not call out the President if you're slamming politicians who won't be instructed by religious officials?  Maybe because a lot of Christianity Today readers would cancel their subscriptions.  Or maybe because what you really care about is getting Republicans elected, and you'll use any argument to advance that agenda.  Careful there, Christianity Today.  You're wielding a two-edged sword.

       urlLink It's  certainly not "the  untimate  romantic comedy" as the poster at the video store boasts.  It's not that bad, either, except for the narrator waxing philosophical at the beginning of the movie.  We're treated to images of loved ones at the airport hugging and kissing each another.  The voice-over assures us that despite the horrors of 9/11 we can take heart because, "love actually is all around us."  Rest easy.  Most people aren't at the airport to turn planes into missiles.  But that misses the point.  I can just as easily see the 9/11 hijackers embracing their loved ones at the airport as I can any of the characters we meet in the movie.  The problem is not that there's not enough love in the world.  The problem is that we only love members of our own tribe.  The world will be a better place only when people open their arms to their rivals and even their enemies.  That said, there are plenty of funny moments in the movie.  The all-star cast does as much with the formulaic material as can be expected.  Alan Rickman is his loveable, surly, sourpuss self.  Billy Bob Thornton nicely plays a President of the United States that combines the worst of our current and former chief executives:  arrogance and adultery.

      I've returned to  urlLink Marsden's biography of Jonathan Edwards , and was interested to read about contemporary worship in 18th century New England.  Prior to Issac Watts, Calvinist hymnody consisted of cantors leading the congregation in acappella signing of the Psalms.  The Puritans did play musical instruments, but never in worship.  The tunes they employed in worship were dreadful, in part so that the music would not overshadow the power of the words.    Watts wrote paraphrases of the Psalms, insisting that as long as the hymns were Biblically based, they needn't be taken from the Bible word-for-word.  Edwards and other New England clergymen, convinced that beauty could spur devotion to God, urged congregations to sing hymns in three-part harmony.  In their judgment, the new tunes were aesthetically superior to the warbling cadences that had evolved over the past couple of generations.  Predictably, the laity revolted.  They didn't want to learn to sign in harmony, and they worried that this was but one step down the slippery slope into Anglicanism and Popery.  Sound familiar?  Yes and No.  Yes, lifelong Christians continue to put up a fuss with the introduction of contemporary Christian music.  The new melodies are unfamiliar.  They sound secular rather than sacred.  And they play the theology card too, although today the danger isn't "Popery," but Pentecostalism.  "If we start singing Shine, Jesus, Shine pretty soon we're gonna be raising our hands and speaking in tongues!"  But the reasons for making the change are a bit different.  Today, ministers push contemporary worship as a way of reaching unchurched people.  Edwards and his colleagues pushed innovative hymnody for a different reason.  They thought the new hymns sounded better, were more capable of inspiring the people, and were therefore worth learning.  In short, the new hymns were for the benefit of the people already there, whether they knew it or not.  This section of Marsden's biography got me thinking that ministers need more than good exegetical and homiletical skills in order to be effective worship leaders.  They need to have good taste in music.  That doesn't mean possessing a bias for or against one musical genre.  There's good and bad Jazz, good and bad classical music, good and bad hip hop, and so forth.  But what does it mean?  And how would seminaries train ministers in developing good musical taste?

      If  urlLink yesterday's campaigning  is any indication, President Bush's pitch to the American people is going to be something along the lines of:  Vote for me because I'm a queer-bashing regular guy just like you .   The music, the settings and the speeches presented Bush as a champion of bedrock conservative values while portraying Kerry and his Democratic allies as liberal elitists. "It's great to be in the heartland of the country," the president told his Missouri audience. "They (Democrats) somehow believe the heart and soul of America can be found somewhere in Hollywood. The heart and soul of America is found right here in Springfield, Missouri." What a difference four years makes! In the last campaign, Governor Bush took a swipe at conservative icon Robert Bork, repudiating the notion that the nation was "slouching toward Gomorrah." Yesterday President Bush suggested that he was the umbrella shielding America from a fire and brimstone thundershower.  The Bush campaign can't help but run on meanness because they have very little to point to in the way of accomplishments. Consider some of the signature acts and pieces of legislation that have been consummated by the 43rd President:   The War in Afghanistan . Nearly three years after invading Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden is still at large, and the Taliban are  urlLink on the rebound , and the U.S. backed government's authority ends at the Kabul city limits. Al Qaeda operatives have carried out bombings in Bali, Indonesia and Madrid, killing hundreds. Why are we on the verge of losing in Afghanistan? Could it be because...   The War in Iraq  siphoned personnel, money and attention away from Afghanistan and squandered the good will the U.S. enjoyed after 9/11?  No WMDs has undermined the rationale for the war. There is no end in sight to a guerilla war that's killed over 900 Americans and wounded thousands.   Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage . The Medicare Administrator threatened to fire a subordinate is he told Congress the true cost of the plan. Seniors find the drug cards confusing. The criteria for choosing a plan will change completely in 2006 when the cards are phased out and everyone's enrolled. Nice.   McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform . Is it a success? I don't know, but it doesn't matter. The Republican base hated it, and this campaign is all about placating the base.   No Child Left Behind Act . Lofty goals, but no federal dollars to achieve the goals. Can you say "unfunded mandate?" Republicans could, once upon a time. Red states Virginia and Utah toying with opting out.   Budget Surplus . It's now a  urlLink deficit of $450 billion , an all-time-high.   Taxes . The administration slashed upper income tax rates, ended the estate tax, and cut taxes on investments. This is an achievement for those who make a whole lot of money off investments, and who stand to inherit a whole lot of money.   Partial Birth Abortion Act . He signed it into law. It may or may not survive court challenges. It may lead to doctors using an even more barbaric procedure to end late-term pregnancies.   The Economy . The last quarter's three percent GDP growth was less than the Clinton administration's average. Job losses in this administration are the worst since the Hoover administration.  If taxes and abortion are your sole political issues, then I can understand why you're voting for President Bush. But most people didn't reap the huge tax cut you might have, and most people don't base their vote solely on the abortion issue. If you're voting for Bush this fall, how can you commend this administration to your fellow citizens? What can you point to in the way of achievements? I'd like to know.

      Scenario One: Gas was expensive that election year. Job growth was meager. And in the Middle East, the United States had suffered diplomatic and military reversals. Deep dissatisfaction brewed in the electorate, but the polls showed the incumbent in a competitive position, until voters became convinced that the challenger could be trusted with the keys to the White House. The opposition swept into office in a landslide.  Scenario Two: The war that the ruling party had launched was going badly. The public was divided over whether the war was worth it. The opposition didn't nominate a peace candidate. Rather, they put forward a man who, while coy about details, promised that he could bring the conflict to a more satisfactory conclusion than the party in power. He won a narrow victory.  Scenario Three: The incumbent's poll numbers were rather low. His party had long been in ascendancy. Change was in the autumn air. Or was it? The incumbent ran a vigorous campaign, his opponent an insipid one, and the President surprised everyone by winning four more years in office.  So what say you Ivy Bush nation? Is it 1980 all over again (scenario one), with John Kerry cast as Ronald Reagan? Or is this election a reprise of 1968 (scenario two), and Kerry is the (Ha, Ha) Richard Nixon of our time? Or is George W. Bush gonna Give 'em Hell like ol' Harry Truman did in 1948 (scenario three)?  I'm hoping for scenario two because I like my irony delicious and served up in double doses.

      Once upon a time I was a member of the board of directors of a small, non-profit agency.&nbsp; A board of do-gooders, liberals and Mad-as-Heck kind of folk.&nbsp; Said agency was in a running dispute with&nbsp;what we'll call&nbsp;a large corporation in the community about, shall we say, the quality of its product, and the impact on the community.&nbsp; Said agency cajoled said corporation to do better.&nbsp; Finally said corporation called our bluff.&nbsp; "OK," the CEO conceded, "we'll do A,B and C, but you're going to have to raise a lot of money to sustain A, B and C."   The board evaluated the proposal.&nbsp; Members vented&nbsp;plumes of righteous indignation.&nbsp; How dare they expect us to pony up $_______?&nbsp; That's mere change for them.&nbsp; They can do more.   Of course they could.&nbsp; But it was obvious they wouldn't.&nbsp; So we had to decide.   This board of do-gooders, liberals and Mad as Heck kind of folk wanted to say No for a number of reasons, I guess.&nbsp; We'd never raised money like this before.&nbsp; Fear of failure was a factor.&nbsp; Managing this money would make new accounting&nbsp;demands on the board.&nbsp; Did we want the added burden?   Most of all, however, I think we feared succeeding.&nbsp; For if we succeeded, we'd lose all those resentments we'd nursed over the years.&nbsp; We'd have to go from being angry to being, well, managerial.   Eventually we chose to meet our partner halfway.&nbsp; We chose to put the community's needs ahead of our own righteous indignation.&nbsp; The joint venture succeeded, and led to new joint ventures.&nbsp; Everybody won--the agency, the corporation and most of all, the community.   I think that Nader and his supporters would rather nurse their resentments than get in there and risk failure, or better yet, risk success.

      I've had little to say about Ralph Nader's bid for the White House.&nbsp; It's taken me some time to sort out what it is about Nader and his supporters that bothers me so.&nbsp; It goes beyond simply siphoning votes from Kerry.&nbsp; But now I think I can put it into words.   Nader and his ilk expect a&nbsp;grade of purity in the Democratic Party that our system of government simply won't permit.&nbsp; Long before Democrats and Republicans rigged the campaign finance laws in favor of themselves, the Constitution, with its checks and balances stymying sudden, radical change, was shaping&nbsp;a political process that favored wholesale politics.&nbsp; If Nader wants a Democratic Party in his image, then he needs a parliamentary system of government with proportional representation.&nbsp; Otherwise he'll have to put up with a&nbsp;big tent&nbsp;of pro-choice, pro-corporate affluent suburbanites, pro-gun New Dealers, blacks, union bosses and whatnot, some of whom share his passions, others actively working against him on several issues.   That said, even European democracies would disappoint.&nbsp; ideologically pure parties tend to be small.&nbsp; They have to form coalitions with other parties to govern.&nbsp; Often this means if not selling your soul, then selling a principle or two for the sake of expediency.   I don't expect the Democratic Party to establish the peaceable kingdom.&nbsp; I just hope that Democrats will honor treaties more than Republicans do.&nbsp; I hope that they'll try speaking softly before wielding a big stick, to quote a not-so-bad Republican.&nbsp; I don't believe for a second that they can make a new heavens and a new earth, but I know for sure that they're less greedy to destroy the earth in the name of growth than the guys on the other side of the aisle.&nbsp;   I do have higher expectations of the church and myself, since the mission of the church is to bear witness&nbsp;here and now to the kingdom that is sure to come.&nbsp; Yet we fail miserably every day.&nbsp; Why find fault with the Democratic Party,  urlLink an instrument of God's wrath , when I and my brothers and sisters in Christ are such sorry excuses for&nbsp;God's grace?   I don't know what Nader's religious beliefs are, and who knows how many of his supporters could be defined as "secular."&nbsp; I do wonder if ethical secularism inevitably makes a god of politics.&nbsp; If so, you will be doomed to playing the part of the scorned lover, as the all-too-human parties you put your trust in inevitably disappoint.

      The Nobel Prize winning organization  urlLink Doctors Without Borders  is  urlLink pulling out of Afghanistan  after 24 years of service in that nation.&nbsp; The security situation has deteriorated to such a point that the aid agency can no longer justify its presence there.    ``We've had people killed in the past in conflicts -- humanitarian aid does have inherent risks,'' (Kenny) Gluck said. The difference is ``people are explicitly targeting us, and there's no commitment from the government to protect us.''   That's the U.S.-backed government, by the way.&nbsp; Not the Taliban or the Communist puppets propped up by the Soviet invasion in 1979.&nbsp;   Meanwhile at least 68 people died in a suicide bombing in Iraq  urlLink today .&nbsp; And  urlLink more American soldiers have died  in the 28 days after the so-called transfer of sovereignty than died in the 30 days prior to it.   This President could wind up being the first one in history to lose two wars at once.

      Barack Obama's keynote address did not disappoint.&nbsp; There were times when I was moved to tears.&nbsp; Obama is the son of a white woman from Kansas and a Kenyan immigrant.&nbsp; He wove his personal story together with the larger American story in a powerful way.&nbsp; He said that his parents weren't afraid of giving him an unusual name because in a tolerant America it doesn't matter what your name is.&nbsp; He dismissed the notion of a polarized electorate, saying that in Blue State America "we worship an awesome God," and in Red State America we have gay friends and relatives whom we care about.&nbsp; There is no white America, black America, Latino America; Obama asserted.&nbsp; We're all Americans.&nbsp;  E pluibus unum .&nbsp; From many, one.&nbsp; Obama's DNA is tattooed with that Latin phrase.   Unlike Howard Dean's somewhat clumsy attempts to reach out to culturally conservative voters, Obama's talk about "values" and "culture" rang true.&nbsp; He condemned the mentality that accuses black parents reading books to their children&nbsp;of "acting white."&nbsp; He acknowledged the genuine concern among residents of suburbs and inner cities that their tax dollars not be wasted, either at the Pentagon or at the welfare agency.&nbsp; But in true Democratic fashion he asserted the government's essential role in providing an opportunity for all citizens to reach their potential.&nbsp; And he used the accountability theme to criticize the current administration for sending soldiers to war under false pretenses and in insufficient numbers to win the peace.   I've been waiting nearly my whole adult life&nbsp;for a politician&nbsp;like this.&nbsp; Barack Obama made me proud to be an American.

      It's been six months since Democrats kicked Howard Dean to the curb, and the talking heads are still wondering if the Party looks "too mean."&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; Since when is a thoughtful, passionate speech critiquing the opposition and advancing your own ideas "mean?"&nbsp; Labeling the speaker "mean" says more about you than the speaker, unless the speech contains ad hominem attacks (and last night's speeches didn't).  Once upon a time it was the Republicans who had to avoid looking mean.&nbsp; I didn't understand it then either.&nbsp; I saw Pat Buchanan's speech at the '92 convention and thought it was a pretty good speech, only filled with&nbsp;political ideas I wholly repudiate.&nbsp;  After reading  urlLink this , I'm looking forward to hearing Barrack Obama tonight.

      In  urlLink commenting  on The Washington Post's declining circulation Josh Marshall writes, "The broad story seems to be that the newspaper world, which was once built on big city newspapers, is polarizing towards a crop of, in effect, national newspapers and a larger universe of much smaller ones that are intensely local in their focus. The Post, for a series of reasons, seems to be getting caught betwixt and between by that polarizing trend."&nbsp;   So what I've been noticing about The Charlotte Observer is part of a&nbsp;nationwide re-shuffling.&nbsp; I still don't like it, but now I can put it in context.&nbsp; BTW, today's Observer leads with the Democratic Convention.&nbsp; Bully for them.

      When Richard Vinroot surprised everybody by declining to call for a runoff, he anointed Patrick Ballantine to take on Governor Easley.&nbsp; Earlier  urlLink I ridiculed the chances of any Republican  unseating Easley in this fall's election.&nbsp; But now that we know it's Ballantine, it occurs to me that I know very little about the man.&nbsp; I spent a few minutes poking around  urlLink his website , and  urlLink Mike Easley's as well .   Unlike  urlLink the man who wants  to be  urlLink Bud's  Congressman, Ballantine is not a bomb thrower.&nbsp; Under the issues tab he has a link to a "family values" topic where he extols his wife and children, mentions that he's pro-life and adds that marriage should be&nbsp;a union between a man and a woman.&nbsp; Its an irenic social conservatism.   Comparing the web sites the two candidates seem to differ greatest on points of emphasis.&nbsp; Easley's issues page has statements on infant mortality and predatory lending.&nbsp; Ballantine's page has a statement on the second amendment.&nbsp; On taxes, Ballantine proposes slashing personal and corporate rates.&nbsp; Easley says he wants to lower the corporate rate, but is more coy than Ballantine about naming a figure.&nbsp; Easley also proposes re-writing the tax code to reflect the change from an industrial-based economy to a service-based economy.&nbsp; I suppose Ballantine would be against any tax reform that increased state revenues, but some reform is surely needed.&nbsp; Why is food taxed,&nbsp;but attorney's services are not?   Ballantine's&nbsp;support of the clean smokestacks bill pleases me.&nbsp; And Ballantine seems to have a more concrete plan to strengthen community colleges than Easley.&nbsp; He wants to consolidate the administration of the state's job training programs and funnel the savings into the community colleges.&nbsp; All I could find on the subject at Easley's website was his support for an increase in CC teacher pay.   Who knows if it's a workable plan?&nbsp; Candidate's web sites always put their ideas in the best possible light, and I'm not informed enough to critically evaluate it.&nbsp;   That said, we need some kind of plan.&nbsp; North Carolina is hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs.&nbsp; A strong community college system is essential for retraining the unemployed and&nbsp;laying a foundation&nbsp;of skilled labor on which the state's economy can be built.&nbsp; I know more than one person who's failed to gain admission to a CC program, not because they didn't have the grades, but because there weren't enough sections available to accommodate all the qualified applicants.&nbsp; That's gotta change.&nbsp; Ballantine is at least talking about what to do to change that situation, and because he is, I'm willing to give him a hearing between now and November.

I'm a Calvinist so I'm in complete agreement with Mr. Sides.&nbsp; Shoot, what  isn't  the will of the Almighty, Omnipotent, Omniscient Father in Heaven?&nbsp; Bill Clinton's two terms in office?&nbsp; His acquittal in the impeachment trial?&nbsp; All God's will.&nbsp; Surely Mr. Sides would have to agree.  There's something unseemly about using spiritual symbols to acquire temporal power.&nbsp; Arrogant as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is chalking up one's election victory to the Almighty an act of self-abasement, a way to avoid taking credit?&nbsp; Or is it a way of saying, "God is on my side, and my enemies are God's enemies."  You probably know the old story about a clergy delegation that met with President Lincoln.&nbsp; They assured him that God was on his side.&nbsp; Lincoln replied that he was more concerned about whether or not he were on God's side.&nbsp; Mr. Sides would do well to learn a little about politics and spirituality from the greatest Republican that ever lived.

       The Charlotte Observer  has a new publisher.&nbsp; Said publisher promises to give people "the news they want."&nbsp; What does this mean?&nbsp; Apparently it means that people don't care about what's going on outside a 50 mile radius of the uptown.&nbsp; Tuesday's front page&nbsp;featured&nbsp;not one&nbsp;article about national or international events.&nbsp; The continuing series on the Pillowtex collapse was entirely appropriate for page A1.&nbsp; So was an article about the North Carolina primary.&nbsp; But Nelly becoming a minority owner of the Charlotte Bobcats?&nbsp; Either the Business or the Sports section would have been a better host for that news.&nbsp; And some waitress selling beer to underage drinkers, one of whom was involved in a fatal DWI?&nbsp; That belongs in the Local section, perhaps well inside.   Today's  Observer  was more of the new regime.&nbsp; A box on A1 referred the reader to an article inside about the Sandy Berger investigation, the only reference to the outside world.   The new publisher doesn't understand that this&nbsp;layout is giving its readers exactly what they  don't  want.&nbsp; Especially those of us in outlying counties.&nbsp; I read  The Salisbury Post  to keep an eye on the County Commission, but turn to the  Observer  for national politics and world affairs.&nbsp; There's a lot of us like that.&nbsp;   What the new publisher means is to give the TV watchers what they want.&nbsp; Pretty soon the  Observer  is going to be a print version of Channel 9 Eyewitness News, all murders and car crashes.&nbsp; Except that the Observer can't compete with Channel 9's "breaking news" from a helicopter observing some LA-style police chase.&nbsp; The TV watchers will keep watching TV, and people like me will cancel their subscriptions and read the New York Times online.

      As I predicted, Coach K will be at Duke next year.&nbsp; But contrary to my  urlLink predictions , Will Willimon will not.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad that I was only one out of two.&nbsp; I am delighted that Coach K will stay&nbsp; and Willimon will leave.&nbsp;  urlLink Willimon  was elected bishop last week and was consecrated on Saturday morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; He will be the bishop of the North Alabama Annual Conference.  &nbsp;  Why is this good news?&nbsp; The  urlLink Council of Bishops  in the UMC is not known for its theological profundity.&nbsp; A friend of mine who attended our recent general conference said he watched our council of bishops up on stage in Pittsburgh.&nbsp; They were not a very impressive group, mostly just good managers who had a nice enough personality to get elected by their jurisdiction.&nbsp; Seldom do they ever engage the issues confronting our church and world from a theological perspective.&nbsp; Most of the time, they put a vaguely religious stamp on whatever the democratic party favors.&nbsp; I don't think that's what Jesus had in mind when he said to Peter, "You are a rock, and on this rock I will build my church.&nbsp;&nbsp; The gates of hell will not prevail against it!"  &nbsp;  The gates of hell have been having their way with the UMC for a long time.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, they have taken us to the spiritual&nbsp;woodshed pretty much ever since John Wesley died.&nbsp; This is not just the bishops' fault.&nbsp; There are plenty of pastors who could have done better (including me!), and plenty of lay people, too.&nbsp; But the bishops should set the pace, encourage us, inspire us, and help us be oriented toward the Triune God.&nbsp; They should keep us centered in the faith once and for all delivered to the saints.&nbsp; Unfortunately, American Methodism after Wesley died, resorted to the pragmatic approach.&nbsp; Whatever could bring in the greatest number of souls was assumed to be based on good theology.&nbsp; We got away with&nbsp;that&nbsp;for a while, but in the last 30 years or so, people have begun to notice that the emperor&nbsp;isn't wearing any&nbsp;clothes.&nbsp; Some people (Good News, Confessing Movement) reacted to this by ridiculing the emperor.&nbsp; Some people (mainline liberals) have continued to insist that we weren't really running a theological nudist camp.&nbsp; Not many leaders have tried to do the right thing: put the clothes back on, specifically the baptismal garments of Christ.  &nbsp;  This summer may mark a turning point for our Council of Bishops.&nbsp; Not only was Will Willimon elected bishop, but so was  urlLink Scott Jones  of SMU/Perkins.&nbsp; When you add these two to Bishop  urlLink Timothy Whitaker  of the Florida Conference, you may begin to see the dawning of a new day in the Council.&nbsp; And of course, there is the good news of  urlLink Joseph Sprague's retirement .&nbsp; Unfortunately, Bishop Kenneth Carder is also retiring, but I believe he will continue to exercise his positive influence.  &nbsp;  So, there's Willimon, Jones, Whitaker, and Carder.&nbsp; Four theological heavy-weights.&nbsp; There may be other theological heavy-weights on the Council; I just don't know about them.&nbsp; They could provide doctrinal leadership that is not held captive to the ideological left or right.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Liberal Protestantism, once the dominant force in all mainline Protestant churches, has had its day in the sun.&nbsp; It has been judged and found wanting.&nbsp; A new day is coming: call it cultural-linguistic, post-liberal, or whatever, but it's coming - (but it's not here yet).&nbsp;

       urlLink As I said before , Michael Moore's new movie is thought-provoking.&nbsp; There's nothing like sitting in a hospital room for a week to give free reign to those provoked thoughts.&nbsp; At this point I'm less enthusiastic about the movie than I was a week ago.  &nbsp;  To reiterate, Moore spends a great deal of time exploring the relationships between President Bush, former president&nbsp;George H.W. Bush, James Baker, the corporate boards on which they sit and the Saudi royal family and the bin Laden family.&nbsp; Moore alleges that the Bushes are in so deep with these creepy people that they haven't prosecuted the war on terror with sufficient vigor.&nbsp; Why let members of the bin Laden family fly out of the country before questioning them about their most notorious relative?&nbsp; Why invade Afghanistan with a mere 11,000 troops and take three months to&nbsp;work your way up to bin Laden's front door at Tora Bora?  &nbsp;  It's clever, a leftist complaining that this administration is soft on terror.&nbsp; It's also a stunning allegation, that the President, if not aiding and abetting the enemy, is so financially beholden to the enemy's friends and family that he's making poor decisions.&nbsp; No wonder Republicans hate this movie.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Are such allegations beyond the pale?&nbsp; In World War I, there was open concern that the British royal family, the house of Hanover,&nbsp;might not be behind the war effort 100%.&nbsp; Three years ago I couldn't have imagined the United States of America walking away from the Geneva Conventions.&nbsp; I think that since September 11, 2001 nearly anything's possible.  &nbsp;  But in this case I think Moore is wrong.&nbsp; The military invaded both Afghanistan and Iraq with relatively few soldiers.&nbsp; These wars tested Donald Rumsfeld's&nbsp;theory that a fast, light, technologically advanced army can do what in years past only a heavier, bigger force could do.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Rumsfeld was half-right.&nbsp; The Taliban and the Iraqi Army fled before the Americans.&nbsp; But such a force is not up to the task of nation-building:&nbsp; sealing borders, training new police and army units, suppressing lingering resistance, establishing the rudiments of a civil society, etc.&nbsp; The bad news out of Iraq and, increasingly,&nbsp;Afghanistan, is daily proof.  &nbsp;  They didn't plan for the postwar period.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; They didn't want to because they have contempt for nation building.&nbsp; And they convinced themselves that they didn't need to because they could hand over the countries in question to their surrogates--in Afghanistan, the warlords, and in Iraq,&nbsp;Ahmed Chalabi.&nbsp; Despite all the rhetoric about establishing democratic beachheads in the Arab world, the administration would be content with pro-American strongmen.&nbsp; Read  urlLink Josh Marshall's interview with Joe Biden  .&nbsp; Biden reports that Dick Cheney has candidly confessed that they have no intention of building a state in Afghanistan because there wasn't one to begin with.&nbsp; When Biden remarked that Al Qaeda thrived in precisely those chaotic conditions, Cheney told him that if they came back they'd deal with them.&nbsp; "Whack a mole" Biden calls it.  &nbsp;  Though Moore may be wrong, there's still plenty of reason to be concerned about this administration's approach to terrorism.&nbsp; They seem to think that if Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Iran can be transformed into something like, say, Egypt or Saudi Arabia, pro-American&nbsp;though repressive, then terrorism will go away.&nbsp; But those are the exact kind of conditions that breed hatred of the United States.&nbsp; And failed states like Afghanistan, Somolia, Sudan and others are where they will flock.&nbsp; Soon, there will be more moles crawling out there than we can whack.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The neocons that wanted this war saw Iraq as their Munich moment, but they&nbsp;failed to&nbsp;learn the lesson from the other bookend of that frightful period in world history, the Marshall Plan.&nbsp; Call it what you will, nation building, winning the peace, etc., is what is needed now, and this administration is not up to that task.&nbsp; They need to be replaced.&nbsp; On that point, and that's the big point, Moore and I are in full agreement.

      While&nbsp;hanging out&nbsp;in the ICU waiting room I caught a glimpse of the GOP gubernatorial primary debate.&nbsp; Richard Vinroot was pleading with Bill Cobey to admit that he is a liar.&nbsp; I love North Carolina Republicans.&nbsp; They're much more like the PLO than the ANC.&nbsp; By that I mean that they've failed to transform themselves from revolutionaries into statesmen.&nbsp; Power is finally within their grasp, but they've been fighting the power so long they don't know how to act.&nbsp; So the revolution eats its children.  &nbsp;  I can't imagine why Republicans would nominate Vinroot.&nbsp; He didn't beat Mike Easley last time.&nbsp; Why would he this time?&nbsp; This ain't Carolina/Duke, Mr. Vinroot.&nbsp; Losing in January doesn't guarantee you a victory in the re-match.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Truth be told, it doesn't matter who the Republicans put up against Easley. Any of them will lose.&nbsp; George W. Bush carried North Carolina with 57% of the vote in 2000, and even those lengthy coat tails weren't long enough to drag Vinroot into the governor's mansion.&nbsp; Republicans only get to govern North Carolina if the Democratic Party suffers a catastrophic defeat at the national level (such as 1972, 1980, and 1984).&nbsp; It's unlikely we're looking at a similar scenario this time around.  &nbsp;  So let 'em squabble.&nbsp; Hamas and the PA; Cobey and Balantine.&nbsp; It's all the same, and in the end, equally productive.

      Since John Kerry tapped John Edwards to be his running mate, The Charlotte Observer has run at least two front page stories alleging that Edwards has not boosted Kerry's numbers in either nationwide or statewide polls.&nbsp; So what of the  urlLink new Mason-Dixon poll  showing Kerry and Bush neck and neck in North Carolina?&nbsp; The Observer duly noted it, in a paragraph on page five.&nbsp; Sheesh.&nbsp; If I can't count on the Observer, who can I count on?

      Shortly after the shift change at the hospital, my wife called me to wish me a happy anniversary.&nbsp; If it weren't for the helpful floor mats in the elevators at Carolinas Medical Center that say "Have a good Friday" I couldn't have even told you the day of the week, much less the date of the year.&nbsp; The days do run together in institutional settings.&nbsp; Since&nbsp;everyone looks down in elevators, plastering useful information on the floor makes perfect sense.&nbsp; Imagine:&nbsp; you're leaning against your IV pole, looking down while fumbling with a cigarette book and lighter with your one free hand, all the while the nicotine craving is verily screaming for an express ride to the lobby and out the door to the smoking pen under the parking deck, and you know it's Friday.&nbsp; That'll ease those shakes.  &nbsp;  When you wake up from surgery sometimes your intestines stay asleep.&nbsp; Ethan's did.&nbsp; At a loss to proceed down the pipe, Ethan's numerous peanut butter and jelly sandwiches retreated all Wednesday night.&nbsp; In other words, he puked.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; All night long.&nbsp; A stomach pump has stopped the vomiting.&nbsp; Now we wait for his belly to arise and digest, and we can all go home.

      When our oldest son was eight months old he underwent surgery to repair a  urlLink ventricular septal defect (VSD) , a congenital heart condition.  A small percentage of children with VSD repairs develop a secondary condition called  urlLink Double Chambered Right Ventricle .  With this condition, a bundle of heart muscle called the moderator band grows too fast and obstructs the flow of blood through the right side of the heart.  The treatment is surgery to "prune" the tissue back to a normal size.  Ethan is having this surgery tomorrow, and we would appreciate your prayers for his good health.

      I'm tearing through  urlLink The Fortune of War  like hot butter through a knife, as Jack Aubrey might put it.  Poor Jack and Stephen.  Their ship blew up.  They floated for weeks in a twelve foot cutter.  The Java, a British warship, rescued them, only to be defeated by the U.S.S. Constitution (the first time in all these books that I've rooted against the protagonists).  Now the Constitution's returning to Boston to be refitted, carrying Jack and Stephen as prisoners of war.  This paragraph caught my eye:   'That is Cape Fear,' observed Mr. Evans, pointing.  'And now you can see the division between the Gulf Stream and the ocean clearly.  There, do you see, the line running parallel with our course, about a quarter of a mile away.'  'A noble headland,' said Stephen.  'And a most remarkably clear division:  thank you sir, for pointing it out.'   A noble headland indeed.  My mother, sister and brother-in-law live on that noble headland.  Too bad the Constitution didn't put in at Wilmington.  Stephen could have collected samples of the Venus Fly Trap, a carnivorous plant that grows only in the swamps of southeastern North Carolina.  Ah, if Patrick O'Brian were still alive I'd have write him and ask him to return Dr. Maturin to that noble headland.

      Buck has been  urlLink having a spirited debate with Anonymous  at his weblog.  Anonymous has apparently strolled over here.  Downstream, he/she/it left a link to  urlLink this Washington Post article  asserting that yesterday's report on intelligence failures casts doubt on Joe Wilson's accusations as well as whether or not a crime was committed when somebody dropped Valerie Wilson's name in Bob Novak's lap.  Two comments are in order.  First, do read the Post article, and then read  urlLink Josh Marshall's evaluation of it , and make up your own mind about whether or not Post reporter Susan Schmidt is shilling for the administration.  Second, nobody by the name of Anonymous is allowed to comment on this blog.  Anonymous is a coward.  Anonymous needs to leave his/her/it's real name and bona fide email address, because if you can't take it, then you can't dish it out.  Thus Anonymous's little comment downstream has been deleted.  I take all this back if, in fact, Anonymous is Jon McCachren.  Jon dared me to enable comments on my blog because some of the outrageous things I write just beg to be refuted.  Well Jon has yet to take me on.  I told him to his face last week that he was a coward, but he just laughed at me.  Grrr...

      Republicans have been questioning John Edwards' experience this week.  Michael Moore's new movie raises serious questions about George W. Bush's maturity.  What kind of man smirks and winks at off-camera staff just seconds before he goes on TV to announce the beginning of a war?  Better still is his earnest appeal to the leaders of the world to stop international terrorism, followed by, "Now watch this drive."  Whack!  Moore's sound track and clever sampling of old TV shows paints the picture of a spoiled rich kid in over his head as President of the United States, but mainly Moore relies on Bush himself.  What we suspected about the man in 2000 is true.  He's unfit to be President.  Moore surprised me by spending little time on Iraq's non-existent WMD stockpile, and a lot of time on the connections between the Bush family, the Saudi royal family and the bin Laden family.  They're close personal friends and business partners.  Yes, the Bushes and the bin Ladens.  Moore almost suggests that the real enemy in the War on Terrorism is Saudi Arabia, but happily for the Saudis, they've got the First Family in their hip pockets.  The war in Afghanistan was window dressing (more police in Manhattan than troops in Afghanistan, stated one expert); the war in Iraq was for settling old scores and, Yes, protecting the Saudis.  Here the far left and the neocon right almost meet.  The neocons would love to wage war elsewhere in the Middle East, Syria, Iran and especially Saudi Arabia.  What do they think about their beloved President's ties to a fundamentalist Islamic regime, 15 of whose subjects participated in the 9-11 attacks?  The movie succeeds in showing how homeland security isn't about homeland security at all.  It's about keeping Americans anxious enough to let the President fight whatever war he wants to.  Raise the alert code to orange (especially on the eve of an important vote, or after a bit of bad news); lower it to yellow (but never blue or green).  Variable reinforcement.  Everyone who took Psych 101 knows that's the best way to train a seal, or the citizenry.  But why do we keep falling for it?  When Moore introduces the Iraq War he says, "We invaded the SOVEREIGN nation of Iraq, a nation that never attacked the United States, who never threatened to attack the United States."  You could say the same thing about the bombing of Kosovo.  Moore's not a pacifist, so what are his criteria for going to war?  Only in self-defense?  What about humanitarian interventions?  If not the latter then here the far left meets the old guard right.  Pat Buchanan and Bob Novak also opposed the war on Iraq, for exactly the same reasons.  It's a funny and heartbreaking movie.  The 35-40% of the electorate who are hard core Bush supporters probably wouldn't make it past the opening scene, a flashback to Florida, but most everyone else should find it thought-provoking.

      One concern Democrats raised about Edwards was whether or not he could go toe-to-toe with Dubya's pit bull in a Vice-Presidential debate.  I'm not concerned.  I see a remake of A Few Good Men shaping up.  Edwards, the boyishly good-looking lawyer as JAG Tom Cruise goading Dick Cheney (Jack Nicholson) into... what?  Admitting that he outed Valerie Plame?  Probably not, but maybe he can tempt him into dropping another F-Bomb, this time on national TV.

      Both  urlLink Alterman  and  urlLink John Paul  have ripped  urlLink William Safire's column  on the brand-new Kerry/Edwards ticket, but I think that I'll put in my two cents worth too.  Safire faults Kerry for putting politics ahead of experience in choosing Edwards over Gephardt.  Politics influencing a Vice-Presidential choice?  Safire seems shocked (shocked!) to discover gambling in Casablanca.  Shocked, and completely insincere.  Had Kerry tapped Gephardt, Safire would have mocked Kerry's political obtuseness, and ripped Kerry for yoking himself to a stooge for trade unions and protectionism.  In short, Kerry was damned if he did and damned if he didn't.  One wonders if Bill didn't write two columns, and submitted the appropriate one when the news broke.  Safire's paradigm for tapping a Veep is (surprise!) George W. Bush choosing Dick Cheney, a man who couldn't deliver any state but could be counted on to take an active role in government.  But there was plenty of politics involved in creating the Bush-Cheney ticket.  In the public's mind, Bush was a lightweight.  He ran with Cheney to add some heft to the ticket and reassure voters.  As for the Kerry-Edwards ticket, there's no reason to suspect that Kerry intends Edwards to be the sort of do-nothing Vice President that we had before the last few elections.  I suppose that if Kerry wanted to pick somebody with the most experience and the most charisma he should have picked... Bill Clinton.  (There's nothing in the Constitution that says he can't serve again as VP!)  Would that choice have satisfied Billy?  Probably not.

      So Tom Ridge is out there today proclaiming that they have it on very good authority that Al Qaeda will strike the United States this year in order to throw the November elections into chaos.  Do you know who's really using terrorism to influence the elections?  The Bush administration.   urlLink This New Republic article  alleges that the administration is putting tremendous pressure on the Pakistanis to kill or capture high level Al Qaeda operatives, and announce their deaths or capture on July 26, 27 or 28, the first three days of the Democratic National Convention.  Even Ridge's press conference is an example of using the fear and loathing of Al Qaeda for cynically partisan purposes.  Is it any coincidence that Ridge's ominous warnings come just a day after John Kerry electrified his campaign for President by choosing John Edwards as his running mate?  Bin Laden remains at large; Iraq is in chaos; the budget deficit grows.  I guess I can't blame them trying to campaign on fear.  They certainly can't run on their record.

      I've picked up George Marsden's biography of Jonathan Edwards again, a highly informative and readable account of America's foremost Evangelical.  The chapters on the First Great Awakening, and the split it caused among New England clergy touches on contemporary splits between Evangelical and Mainline Protestants.  Undoubtedly the Awakening changed people's lives.  Young adults abandoned the bars for Sunday School classes.  Long-standing disputes over land and timber rights evaporated in the new, more charitable spirit that accompanied the Awakening.     And undoubtedly there were excesses.  The spiritual awakening manifested itself in physical and ecclesiastical forms that scandalized some.  People wept, moaned and shrieked in worship.  Lay preachers roamed the countryside, condemning "unconverted clergy," and encouraged the laity to turn them out.  Women were even instructing men!  Edwards was enthusiastic about the revival, and downplayed its excesses as exceptions to the rule.  Other pastors, such as Charles Chauncy, regarded the excesses as the rule, going so far as to liken the Awakening to the unruly spiritualism of the New Testament church in Corinth.  It was more than a difference of opinion over what passes for good taste.  Edwards and Chauncy had what one might call different theological anthropologies.  Marsden writes:   Chauncy was well aware, of course, that the underlying debate was an old and familiar one even in Puritan circles.  Chauncy stood for the "intellectualist" and more Aristotelian (and Thomistic) tradition, which argued that the will should follow the best dictates of reason.  Edwards was in the more Augustinian "voluntarist" camp that viewed the whole person as guided by the affections of the will.  Both agreed that the spiritual person had to be strictly guided by Scripture and reason.  But the voluntarist emphasized that the intellect, without true affections, was insufficient for true religion.  The proper affections of the will must reign in tandem with intellectual truth.  The intellectualist, by contrast, saw the affections as first of all unruly emotions, which could serve the good only when brought into submission to properly informed reason.  The distinctions were subtle but they could be of immense practical consequence in shaping one's style of religious expression.   I wonder if this divide between the voluntarist and intellectualist camps is the really deep fissure in American Christianity, not the liberal versus conservative stands in the culture wars.  The congregation of childhood is a very conservative church in one of the most liberal denominations in the country, the Presbyterian Church (USA).  Why do they stay?  In part because, much as they dislike the pap that oozes from the denominational headquarters in Louisville, they also dislike the unrestrained bodies and free flow of tears and laughter in denominations that agree with them about abortion and homosexuality.  I find myself on the fence here.  The intellectualist religious atmosphere that is my home can be rather sterile.  When good worship is limited to "a thoughtful sermon" and Christian living is abbreviated to obeying the Golden Rule, something's missing.  God created emotions when God created human beings, and people need to experience God--feel God--along with obeying him and understanding him.    "The proper affections of the will must reign in tandem with intellectual truth."  Maybe the sticking point is "proper."  There is a lot that seems improper in contemporary evangelicalism, a harsh, judgmental spirit, and (give Chauncy his due) a Corinthian-like emphasis on signs, wonders, and emotionalism at the expense of what Paul calls the more excellent way:  love.  Marsden notes that in Edwards' famous  Treatise on Religious Affections  he acknowledges the validity of Chauncy's complaints, without compromising one bit on the underlying theological debate.  And I think that's where I am.    There's a lot of ethical, theological and ecclesiastical confusion in American Mainline churches today, but perhaps the renewal of the mainline lies first and foremost in healing the split between heart and mind, and ministering to and ministering out of the whole person.  A 21st century apprpriation of America's greatest 18th century theologian.  Don't know what that looks like concretely, but maybe it will come into focus...

      Just prior to the release of  urlLink Master and Commander:  The Far Side of the World , I heard an NPR commentator proclaim Patrick O'Brian's novels some of the best historical fiction ever written.  Philistine that I am, I'd never even heard of Patrick O'Brian.  I decided to read the book first.  Now I'm completely hooked.  I've read seven of the twenty novels in the series.  I can't wait for the library to re-open from its Independence Day holiday that I may get my greedy hands on another one.  The books have great characters.  Captain Jack Aubrey is a talented, courageous and somewhat reckless officer in Lord Nelson's British Navy.  In the early books he's a rake as well, and always he's eager for prize money.  Though Aubrey is a loyal subject of the King and a Tory to boot, if he were to give his sailors a pep talk before encountering the enemy (and he doesn't), he wouldn't appeal to their patriotism as he does in the movie.  ("Do you want guilotines in Picadilly?"  he cries.  "No!" the men roar.)  He'd remind them of their share of the profits after they capture and sell the enemy ship.  On land, however, Aubrey is the proverbial fish out of water.  He knows far more about sailing than love, thoroughbred horses or the stock market, so his prize money frequently slips through his fingers.  The other main character is Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon and a scientist.  Maturin and Aubrey met at a concert, and the former elbowed the latter in the ribs, annoyed that he was tapping his foot in rhythm with the music.  Soon, however, they were making music together, playing the cello and violin in the captain's quarters every evening.  Hitching a ride on a British man-of-war abets Maturin's desire to discover new species of flora and fauna in far flung ports of call.  As a minor bird watcher, minor gardener and outdoor enthusiast, I share Maturin's joy when he captures a new beetle, or sketches a new gull following the ship.  Maturin is also a British spy.  Passionately committed to Irish and Catalonian independence, Maturin is convinced that defeating Napoleon is a necessary first step in achieving both goals.  O'Brian fleshes out Aubrey, Maturin and the other characters with a remarkable attention to detail, Maturin's sloppy eating and dressing habits, for instance, or Aubrey's abundant malapropisms.  In fact, there's a remarkable degree of detail about all aspects of life in the early 19th century, everything from the food (soused pig's face is Aubrey's favorite dish), to the practice of medicine (leaches, placebos and amputations), to sailing.  Be warned, if you don't know the difference between the forecastle and the quarterdeck, or beating up as opposed to broaching to, you'll likely read the books as I do, with an open dictionary in your lap.  That may be more effort than you're willing to put into it, especially since it's summer, the season for light reading.  O'Brian's style is rather abrupt.  A new paragraph might find you in a new room or plunged into a new conversation.  A new chapter might find you in a different ocean, with no warning.  "Later, in the gunroom," is the kind of phrase that never graces O'Brian's sentences.  Naval warfare at the turn of the 19th century was an exercise in civilized barbarism.  You could trick your opponent by flying the flag of a neutral country, but you had to run up the Union Jack before opening fire.  Hand to hand combat at boarding was primitive and violent, men hacking each other with knives, swords, axes, anything sharp.  Yet captains surrendered to one another in their best uniforms, were wined and dined by their victorious counterpart, and invited to watch the rest of the battle unfold from the officer's deck.  It reminds me of that old cartoon where Wile E Coyote and the sheepdog "go to work" together, clock in, and then try to kill each other all day, alternately preying upon and defending the sheep, only to clock out at the end of the day and walk home as friends.    It seems a crazy way to wage war, but I wonder if it wasn't what Just War Theory was all about, trying to put a human face on the enemy, and imposing limits on violence, even in the chaotic atmosphere of battle.  Technology has made modern warfare so impersonal I wonder if Just War Theory isn't obsolete in the 21st century.  The Geneva Conventions were a secularized stab at imposing a kind of morality on modern warfare, but it seems as though they've been rendered obsolete as well.  21st century Americans are less aristocratic than 19th century Brits, far more democratic, more individualistic, but in warfare, far less civilized.  How'd that happen?  If you're interested in the books, Norton, O'Brian's U.S. publisher, has a  urlLink web site about the Aubrey-Maturin series .  Check it out.

      Our oldest son is having surgery soon.  More about that later.  For now, Laura and I have been renting movies left and right to keep our minds occupied in the evening.  Here's what we've seen recently, and what we think about them:   urlLink Swimming Pool .  You are a misanthrope author with writer's block.  How do you get your muse back?  Easy.  Spend a few weeks at your publisher's home in the south of France, cooped up with a sexually uninhibited teenager who disgusts yet fascinates you.  Oh yes, and it helps to live out some of the sex and violence you write about in your crime novels.  There's more breasts in this movie than at a Super Bowl halftime show.  I felt a tad icky after watching it.   urlLink 21 Grams .  Benecio del Toro is an ex-con relying on fundamentalist Christianity to keep his inner demons at bay.  Sean Penn needs a heart transplant.  Somebody else plays a wife and mother with a little drug problem.  A tragic accident brings them all together.  There's a heart transplant and a murder plot, so far as I can tell, but since we wee trying to get our minds OFF of surgery, this one didn't work too well, so we ejected it after a while.  I'd like to see how it ends up, or begins up.  The movie doesn't go in chronological order.  Del Toro is an amazing actor.   urlLink Who Is Cletis Tout?   We popped this in after 21 Grams.  Christian Slater plays a prison escapee who assumes the identity of a man that the mob is trying to kill.  Tim Allen is the assassin who might let him live if his life story is good enough to turn into a movie.  I had forgotten that Slater played Adso in The Name of the Rose, a wretched movie yet an amazing book.  This one of his was a charming comedy.   urlLink Bend It Like Beckham .  Teenage rebellion.  Second generation immigrant with a foot in the Old World and a foot in the new culture.  Grrl power.  There's nothing terribly original about this movie, but so what?  I thought it was great.     urlLink Freaky Friday .  Mother and daughter switch bodies for a day.  Funny, funny, funny.  Falling down funny.  Laugh out loud funny.  "You see?"  said a friend.  "Not every good movie is an indie."  P.S.  And since I'm wearing out the IMDb site, I ought to say that a friend of mine is  urlLink listed there .  P.P.S.  Next week--the Marlin Brando film festival.

      This is a job for a Dookie, so sorry, Marvin, but I must lead this discussion.  I am sure my friends at  urlLink Scandalofpartiularity  and  urlLink Gutless pacifist  would agree: there is a mysterious link between Duke basketball and Duke theology. We welcome comments from outsiders, but this is clearly our domain.  Although  urlLink Duke Divinity School   has been unable to get the church to recognize basketball as a sacrament, we have already established that it has certain sacramental qualities: it is an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace, and a means by which we receive the same.  It unites us across time with a community of living tradition (past, present, and future), and it has certain soteriological and eschatological dimensions.  It is presided over by a  urlLink great high priest , and it has a  urlLink holy Temple .  We are also surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses whose jerseys hang in the rafters of our holy Temple.    urlLink Will Willimon  once told the story of someone who wrote him a complaint letter.  It seems someone was listening to the live worship service of Duke Chapel on the radio on Sunday, and the broadcast was interrupted with the following message: "we now take you live to Cameron Indoor Stadium for the pre-game show of today's contest and an interview with Coach K...."  Will Willimon, was slightly annoyed, forwarded the letter to Coach K, and asked for an explanation.  Coach K responded to Willimon, saying, "you're just jealous."   There is another parallel here between Coach K and Dean W : both may be leaving this summer.   urlLink Willimon may be elected a bishop , and Coach K may be going to the NBA.  How do you sort through that analogy?  They both may be "bumping up" to the "next level?"  I'm not sure.  That would take Stanley Hauerwas to figure out.  My bet is that WW and K will both be back at Duke next year.  Here are my reasons:  *Coach K is king of college basketball; why would he want to leave that?  Not for the money, but maybe for the challenge of it.  *Willimon probably won't get elected bishop, although I'd be glad if he did.  He is so popular that some jurisdictional delegates are jealous of him.  He'd make a great bishop, someone who would bring theological depth and integrity to a sometimes confused council of bishops, but the church may not really be ready for that yet.    So, all in all, my prediction is that K will not choose to go to Babylon, and WW will not be given the chance to go to Jerusalem.  They'll both be back at dear ol' Duke next year.

      It's nothing compared to the irregular heartbeats, churning stomachs, sweaty palms and other symptoms sweeping Blue Devil Nation this morning.  Like  urlLink Tom Sorenson , I have no idea if Coach K can succeed in the NBA.  I have no idea if a Coach K protege can succeed at Duke.  I don't even know for sure that he's going to the Lakers.  I just know that there's weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth in the Devil's domain, and that makes me happy.

      Da Brooks, as  urlLink John-Paul  has dubbed him, laments the polarization of American politics  urlLink here .  Red America and Blue America increasingly live, work, play and worship with their own ilk, and that heightens each group's antipathy for the other.  The solution?  A voluntary program of national service which would allow people to work with different sorts of folks, creating opportunities for dialogue and conflict reduction.  Let me make two points in reply:  First, I don't recall Mr. Brooks wringing his hands about the political incivility when Rush Limbaugh and Jerry Falwell were accusing the Clintons of murdering Vince Foster.  Polarization seems to be a problem only when Republicans are in office, and the Democrats are highly motivated to turn them out.  Second, and more importantly, we used to have a very effective means for getting people of different races, classes and political ideologies to interact with one another:  busing.  My wife, for instance, is a graduate of West Charlotte High School because she was bused from her white, upper income neighborhood to a formerly all-black school in the ghetto.  She went to school with rich white kids, poor black kids, rednecks, punk rockers, immigrants, the whole nine yards.  She didn't march, she  boogied  in the West Charlotte High School marching band.  She loved her high school experience and wouldn't trade it for anything in the world, even the surpassing value of a "neighborhood school."  That's right boys and girls; my wife went to school with da boys in da hood, and she's none the worse for wear.  Busing is largely a thing of the past because judges and activists on Mr. Brooks' side of the political aisle have killed it.  After a successful lawsuit by a group of parents (all of which, it needs to be noted, moved here from outside the South) the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district has far more schools where the overwhelming majority of kids are of one particular ethnic group, and are either on or off free lunch.  Some of the schools are terribly overcrowded while others are only half to three-quarters full.  And, best of all, the average bus ride time has INCREASED since busing ended.  Perhaps Da Brooks prefers national service to busing because the former is voluntary; the latter is mandatory.  But the voluntary nature of national service won't solve the problem of group-think.  It'll only appeal to people who already reject the birds of a feather mentality which Brooks says is poisoning political discourse.  If Mr. Brooks thinks that exposure to diverse people is good for civil society, then he and his ilk ought to call the dogs off the most successful effort ever to diversify America--busing.

      I'll admit it: the closest I've been to a boxing ring is possessing the same name as the  urlLink greatest middleweight champion of all time . That said, learning to play the cello is no joke.  I've wanted to learn to play an instrument for some time now. I'm surrounded by musicians. My wife plays the flute. If my next-door neighbors could clone themselves they could fill all the chairs in an orchestra pit, so varied are their musical abilities. I think to myself, How wonderful would it be if we were to get together and play periodically? That's how  urlLink Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin  relax after a day of amputating limbs and hand-to-hand combat on the deck of a French man o' war.  I'm not starting from scratch. I took piano lessons when I was a kid. I can read music, but I've forgotten everything about the piano except C, F and G chords.  Why the cello? Because Jack Aubrey is a big, sexy man, not much given to introspection, generous, honorable, athletic and at peace with himself when hacking away at a Frenchman, and Jack plays the violin. Dr. Maturin is moody, introspective, a little guy, no slave to fashion, and Stephen plays the cello. Is that a good reason to play the cello? What's a bad reason? I ask you.  I'll tell you this: I'll bet  urlLink The Hit Man  can't play the cello.

      Because "everything is political, but politics isn't everything" I christen today APOLITICAL WEDNESDAY! (I do hope the Mad Dog Arminians among us will appreciate my use of the word  christen .)  Garden update: the corn came in while we were gone for Ethan's surgery. Alas, by the time we returned and got our wits about us, the soft, sweet Golden Queen on the stalk had browned and firmed up. It's fit for cattle, but not human beings. Better luck next year.  On the bright side, the  urlLink turkey gizzard beans  are producing massive pods swollen with king-sized, meaty, tasty legumes. The okra is similarly prolific. It won't let up until first frost (around Halloween). The tomato and cucumber vines continue to put out nicely in the hot, rainy weather we've been having.  If I can slide a little politics into this apolitical Wednesday: I'm tickled that the General Assembly has approved a bill postponing the state of school until at least August 25. (School starts today in Rowan County). I'd rather vacation in mid-to-late August than June. It's much less crucial to be around the garden in August than June.

      Just take 42 minutes and listen to  urlLink this sermon  entitled, "Why I am opposed to the War in Vietnam" by a Baptist preacher 37 years ago.  At least listen to the last 15 minutes of it.  Long before George W. Bush labeled Iraq, Iran, and N. Korea the "evil axis," Martin Luther King, Jr. describes the "triple evil" of racism, economic exploitation, and militarism.  "We shall overcome because the Bible is right,"  King tells the congregation at Ebenezer Baptist Church in 1967.  "But Good Friday comes before Easter."  He quotes 1 John, "Let us love one another, for God is love.  If we love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us."  "I speak out against this war because I love America.  I am disappointed with America, and there can be no disappointment without great love."  "I call on the young men of America to make a choice today."  King talks about America as an arrogant nation. (Listen up, W!) "Dont let anybody make you think that God chose America as his divine messianic force to be a sort of policeman of the whole world.  God has a way of standing before the nations with judgement and it SEEMS that I can hear God saying to America, 'You are too ARROGANT!  If you don't change your way, I will rise up and break the backbone of your power, and I will place it in the hands of a nation that doesn't even know my name...'"    King expresses dismay that people would ask him why he opposed war; he says it is so obvious that there is a connection between the ministry of Jesus Christ and the practice of peace-making.    He also laments that the same newspapers that praised him for his non-violent activism in the Civil Rights movement would condemn him for speaking out against war.  They don't mention King's condemnation of war at my child's school when they celebrate MLK day.  Wonder why not?   "I don't know about you, but I ain't gonna study war no more."

      I'm glad the Presbyterians have asked a committee to consider selective divestment in Israel! So should the Methodists! Presbyterians are generally a few steps ahead of the Methodists, or so it seems to me.  However, lest you think that I am becoming too chummy with the Presbyterians, I will provide  urlLink this link  entitled, "The Question 'What is an Arminian' answered by a lover of Free Grace," by John Wesley. It has a great opening line!   To say, "This man is an Arminian," has the same effect on many hearers, as to say, "This is a mad dog." It puts them into a fright at once: They run away from him with all speed and diligence; and will hardly stop, unless it be to throw a  stone at the dreadful and mischievous animal.    I went to the home of a certain Presbyterian pastor last Thursday evening for a John Kerry party. It was fun, but I was reminded that I'm not really a good Democrat. Don't worry - I've never voted for a Republican president, and I probably never will, but I just can't forget about the fact that almost all the Democrats (including Kerry and Edwards) lacked the courage and wisdom to vote against the Iraq war. In 2002, I wrote my senator, John Edwards, pleading with him to resist the war fever gripping Washington DC. He wrote me back, explaining that Saddam Hussein had WMD's and we just HAD to invade Iraq to preserve democracy and freedom. How foolish he looks now. So, I'll still vote for Kerry, but I'll be crossing my fingers behind my back.  Peace, Mad dog

      A member of my congregation forwarded me a link to  urlLink this online petition  condemning the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) for anti-Semitism. At issue is whether or not the PC(USA) will divest from some corporations that do business with the Israeli government. Caterpillar has been singled out. It builds the armored bulldozers that the Israeli military uses to demolish Palestinian homes.  The petition contains errors. The PC(USA) has not divested from Israel; it's General Assembly has asked a committee to investigate the idea of selective divestment. A "fair and balanced" account of the General Assembly's action is  urlLink here .  It's not surprising that  urlLink an organization whose web site  contains no listing of staff, a board of directors or sources of funding would play fast and loose with the facts. Just what is the "Jewish Action Taskforce" anyway?  What they are is mad as heck that the PC(USA) would think of implementing the same strategy against Israel that many organizations implemented against South Africa's white, minority government in the 1980s. "Only the moral blindness of Jew-hatred could lead the Church to compare Israels multi-racial democracy to apartheid South Africa," they write.  I made that very comparison in  urlLink this op-ed piece  that I wrote for  The Charlotte Observer  over three years ago. When the Israeli government offers the Palestinians a "state" made up of non-contiguous land, pockets cut off from each other by Israeli settlements and military outposts, and when the Israeli government retains control over the airspace and water rights of the proposed Palestinian "state," such a state looks suspiciously like a Bantustan.  But don't take my word for it. The editors of  Tikkun , a bi-monthly journal on politics, culture and religion, have made that very comparison (see link on sidebar). Tikkun is edited by RABBI Michael Lerner. Go ahead; call him an anti-Semite!  Will divestment work? I don't know. Rev. Mitri Raheb, a Palestinian Lutheran pastor from Bethlehem, has endorsed the idea. He preached at last year's Presbyterian Peacemaking Conference, which I attended. I admire the man for his tireless, non-violent witness against the Israeli occupation. I'll have to give the idea serious consideration.  "Is the Presbyterian Church being anti-Semitic?" my friend asked. No, it's not. Anti-Semitism is acting on the erroneous belief that the Jewish race/religion is inferior. Anti-Semitism is the Holocaust. Anti-Semitism is murdering Daniel Perle simply because he's a Jew. Anti-Semitism is that guy shooting up a synagogue in southern California a few years ago. Anti-Semitism is barring Jews from membership in country clubs.  Selective divestment may be counterproductive, misguided, or ineffective, but it's a specific response to specific policies of a specific government. The broad and nasty brush strokes of anti-Semitism are nowhere to be found here. The anti-Semitism charge, like the "un-American" charge leveled at critics of the Bush administration, is intended to squelch dissent. It's a dangerous tactic. If everything is anti-Semitic then eventually nothing will be anti-Semitic. And that would be very bad for Israel and for Jews the world over.
