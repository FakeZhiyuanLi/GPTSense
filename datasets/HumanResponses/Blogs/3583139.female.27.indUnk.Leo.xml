      J's graduation from Basic/ AIT is on Friday July 2 or in military jargon that would be 02 JUL 04. I however, will be leaving late Tuesday night early Wednesday morning. Its going to be a LONG adventurous drive. I love driving.. especially driving to new destinations through unchartered territory. Well, at least for me anyway. This drive will take me through Texas, Lousiana, and Alabama before reaching my final destination.. Columbus, Georgia. I am excited and can't wait to see him and feel his arms tight around me. I will even be lucky enough to spend a couple of uninterrupted days before he has to report for MORE training. This trip does not come without its nerves and anxiety. My stomach could tell you stories of how its been plagued by butterflies for the last week. See, not only am I going to attend graduation, I will be meeting J's parents for the first time under the title of "girlfriend". Its such a long story as to why they don't know about me or haven't met me yet .. and I'm not going to go there. Anyway, J sent me words of encouragement about the situation and I feel a little better. They don't know about me at all though.. and thats probably where the nerves play a part. This meeting will be interesting and I of course will play out all different scenarios in my head as to how it will go.. until it happens of course.  We'll see.

      So my boyfriend has joined up.. enlisted.. become a joe.. he's trying to be all he can be.. in the ARMY. He left almost 3 months ago. These past 3 months have definetly had there ups and downs. The first week was the lowest and nothing since as been that lonely or hard. I never in a million years would have pictured myself with a military guy. Don't get me wrong I have always LOVED the vision of a man in uniform.. just never thought I'd be the girl knowing about MRE's or BCG's or any combination of 3 and 4 letters that stand for something. What can I say.. LOVE is a crazy thing. I also never enjoyed the idea of a long distance relationship. It won't always be long distance I realize that but, there are so many other things that with a military relationship are unpredictable. Add to that the fact that we're at war.. and the possibility of him being deployed for up to a year. Ugh.. I miss him .. I long for the time when we can be together normally every day. I miss his smile.. his laugh.. his dimples. I miss talking to him and playing scrabble.. and his incredible need to make everything a competition.

      So, in this crazy internet society, everyone is posting all of their own personalized thoughts for... everyone else to read. I am now one of those crazy people. I have been reading others blogs for what seems like forever now. I kinda thought it might be nice to have my own online journal to rant or rave about whatever.. whenever. I don't think my writing is very artistic or poetic as some.. like my friend Heather who pulls me in and enthralls me with her every word.. but the words are my own.. unless one of the many members of my crazy posse steps in and chooses to had their two cents

      So, I have it. I have the dress. "The dress".&nbsp; No official proposal, no ring on my left hand yet. No worries though because, I have the dress. Haha. Ok, so maybe I'm doing this all a little out of order. I think in the girls book of "how your wedding should go" your supposed to have your parents asked for permission, be proposed to (get the ring),&nbsp;start planning the wedding, get the dress...then get married. Oh well, I have never been one to do things "in order". My parents however couldn't be more excited.. as far as I can tell. How could they not.. their first born child should be married in their lifetime..now. They will be gaining an awesome son in law. They may not know him that well now.. but just wait.. till he's been fully initiated.&nbsp; This man is awesome. He has my complete love and respect. He always .. no matter what.. can see some positive attribute in everyone or any situation. He wants to learn something from everyone around him.&nbsp; He's smart and funny.. and adorable ahhh. I love him. I will marry this man.  This is not going in anyway the way I (as a little girl) thought in my head.. and somehow, thats ok with me. I will have my proposal and ring. I don't know when or how.. but I will have it.&nbsp;I'm hoping for something a little surprising and creative oh and not to mention romantic. Not that it can really be a surprise since .. I already have "The Dress". I will definetly keep my blog updated and posted on all events.

      So, I'm home from my, almost a week, long journey to Columbus, GA. I had a blast. It was a long long long drive but I made it there .. and all in one piece. I was so nervous excited all up and down every part of my body. To be back in Georgia(for more than a couple of days) was great only because I was going to be able to see J. Columbus itself I could definetly do with out!! Oh well.. so not why I was there. Wednesday night after I checked in and took a nap and got a bite to eat with Amy and her fiances mom, I tried very hard to get some sleep.. it was hard. So, I repainted my toenails and thought about how the next days events might play out. Let us be reminded that I was going to meet J's parents for the first time. The next day, Thursday, J had his turning blue ceremony. I was soo nervous thinking about meeting J's parents and seeing J for the first time in a month. After all those nerves and all those worries it all played out just fine. I think we had a great time together, alone and with his parents. We even were able to spend our first 4th of July together. Awww. I know its crazy all this crazy love stuff. I think I might try and spend more time writing it all out here instead of driving each and everyone of my friends insane talking about J.. all the time. I can't help it. I love thinking about him and talking about him and dreaming about him.. ahh what he's done to me.  Things are better now that he's graduated from Basic. We went and bought him a new phone.. so now I can call him and leave him messages..even drunk ones. I'm sure those are the best.. yeah right. It made it easier (than last time anyway) to say good bye this time. Saying goodbye still sucks. I can't wait for the time when we can be together.. everyday. Soon enough.. soon enough. Ahhh what a nice thought.
