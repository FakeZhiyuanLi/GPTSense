      There are things out there that'll bend your bones!  Just got off work, at one in the morning.. listening to  urlLink Richard Buckner , tired and strung out, can't quite seem to gather my thoughts. Buckner's good for moments like these. His music is hard to grasp at first, but has a strange structure to it if you listen closely. Strange, as in wonderful.  Of all the things that you keep near, take hold now of the one you have because the time wil come a-lil-too-soon. Boys, the night will bury you.  The moon'll grow & moan tonight & disappear w/o a fight. You won't give up until you lose. Boys, the night will bury you.  Feel her breath upon your ear. The trouble now is not the truth. There are things out there that'll bend your bones. Boys, the night will bury you.  Take a lil sip & dream a bit. But, do you find your attic room? Don't you close those eyes again. Boys, the night will bury you.  Good night :)

       urlLink Selections from The Chuang Tzu      I think it's appropriate to start off with a page on Chuang Tzu, as I took the title of this Blog from a Chuang Tzu passage.

      Hello, and welcome to my Blog!  This is my first ever posting, of many to come. For a while now, I have had noone to share my thoughts, ideas and ramblings with. I used to have many 'outlets', but recently my friends have either moved on or moved away, and I've been boiling over with thoughts. I'm looking forwards to turning my thoughts and emotions into words once again. Hope you'll enjoy it too!

      Let me explain a couple of things. Time is short. That's the first thing. For the weasel, time is a weasel. For the hero, time is heroic. For the whore, time is just another trick. If you're gentle, your time is gentle. If you're in a hurry, time flies. Time is a servant if you are its master. Time is your god if you are its dog. We are the creators of time      the victims of time  and the killers of time. Time is timeless. That's the second thing. You are the clock, Cassiel.

      Feeling particularly cynical tonight..    Have also been thinking about time tonight. Funny how time is never present. We may say it's, say, eight o'clock, but it's really eight going on something. Time is always either in the past or in the future, as long as we can't freeze time it will never be in the here and now. So how can something that is never actually here with us be real? For we are, regardless of how hard some of us try to avoid it, always in the present. Just snap your fingers. That  WAS  the present, but now it's gone. Do it again. Nah, there it goes, it's gone already. Were you actually aware of that moment as it passed you by? It is my goal to be aware of each little moment, to feel it and be inside it and use it, to perceive it, before it actually passes by me. This is what the Zen buddhists mean when they ask us to live life single moment by single moment.    Now, if you don't mind, I am going to put on some overly depressing music, sit and brood by myself for the rest of the night while I nurture my blooming depression. :)     Stones taught me to fly  Love taught me to lie  Life taught me to die

      I was looking through 'Fury' by Salman Rushdie today, looking for a completely different passage, and came up with this one. It reminds me in a way of Gibran's words in the Prophet.    "There is that within us, he was being forced to concede, which is capricious and for which the language of explanation is inappropriate. We are made of shadow as well as light, of heat as well as dust. Naturalism, the philosophy of the visible, cannot capture us, for we exceed. We fear this in ourselves, our boundary-breaking, rule-disproving, shape-shifting, transgressive, trespassing  shadow-self, the true ghost in our machine. Not in the afterlife, or in any improbably immortal sphere, but here on earth the spirit escapes the chains of what we know ourselves to be. It may rise in wrath, inflamed by its captivity, and lay reason's world to waste."    Salman Rushdie, Fury, pp. 128-129

        Today's haiku, a pair, no less:    sad memories flow  like quivering warm air  above the ground    beautiful memories  drown me in tears  tears me apart

        A haiku is not a poem, it is not literature; it is a hand becoming, a door half-opened, a mirror wiped clean.  It is a way of returning to nature, to our moon nature, our  cherry blossom nature, our falling leaf nature, in short, to our Buddha nature.  It is a way in which the cold winter rain, the swallows of evening, even the very day in its hotness, and the length of the night, become truly alive, share in our humanity, speak their own silent and expressive lanugage.  These are some of the characteristics of the state of mind which the creation and appreciation of haiku demand:  Selflessness, Loneliness, Grateful Acceptance, Wordlessness, Non-intellectuality, Contradictoriness, Humor, Freedom, Non-morality, Simplicity, Materiality, Love, and Courage.  -  urlLink Reginald Horace Blyth

      Does evil come from within, or are we simply innocent victims of our environment and surroundings? What about depression, anger and any other negative/destructive emotion? Is it already there, just waiting for a good opportunity to surface? Is it our dark side, something we all have?  urlLink Kahlil Gibran  says that happiness and sorrow are two sides of the same coin, intertwined into eachother. Without one, the other cannot exist. When you're sad, you're sad because of something that once made you happy, and when you're happy, it's because of a situation or feeling that once caused you grief, that has now turned around. Is all this simply a circle of opposing, yet homogenous, emotions. Love and hate really isn't all that far apart from eachother. It's a balancing act.  Why do people commit such  urlLink horrible acts  toward eachother? Is this 'evil', and in that case, what is evil? An irrational and impartial character trait? Do some people do it because they think it'll make them happy? Do they think inflicting pain upon others will somehow make their lives a little less miserable? Or is it madness? Sociopathy? Psychopathy? Some physical or chemical reaction inside their brains that make them lash out at others. Should what we call 'evil' be categorized in the same category as paranoia or schizophrenia? A mental disease..? Can it be cured? Can one be taught to feel empathy? My impression is that this kind of 'evil' is an explosive mixture of hatred, ignorance and desperation, the willingness to do just about anything to get out of whatever situation you're in.  Your joy is your sorrow unmasked. And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears. And how else can it be? The deeper that sorrow carves into your being. the more joy you can contain.  When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy. When you are sorrowful, look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.  Some of you say, "Joy is greater than sorrow," and others say, "Nay, sorrow is the greater." But I say unto you, they are inseparable. Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.  Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy. Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.  I could just swear that Gibran was a Buddhist. :)

      A certain mood moves in, the healing has begun...  When I look truth directly in its eyes, in short, sudden glimpses, like visions.. If I could only keep these moments, maintain them and keep a hold on them, then I'd be on my way towards greatness. I think it's mostly a motivational thing, rather than pure knowledge, because we already have what it takes - each and every one of us. The basis is already there, within. You won't find a 'why' or a 'how' outside of yourself. It's all about timing, doing things at the right time, at the right pace.. working everything out evenly. This is how we should go about in life, working at a constant pace, becoming a little more skillful than yesterday. If I could look myself in the eyes each night and honestly say that I have become a better person during the day, regardless how little, I'd certainly be headed somewhere nice. :)   On a caravan of love, in a shivering slumber A certain mood moves in, the healing has begun

      I could hardly believe my eyes this morning when I noticed there were some yellow leaves on the trees outside my window. This has been the coldest summer I can remember ever having experienced. 9 degrees and rain today... Oh well.. There's still time left for an Indian Summer. :)  I've decided to write a haiku poem every day. I recently read  urlLink "The Haiku Year" , and it inspired me into taking up the challenge myself. :) Go check it out, it's great!   urlLink     My first ever haiku:  Lost moon looking over the water. Summer dream.

        "When I sat down on the bed next to you, you started to cry    I said maybe if I leave, you'd want me to come back home    Maybe all you need is to leave me alone... at least that's what you said."   Late nights at work all week through, and the only thing keeping me happy is the new  urlLink Wilco  album. Thankfully, I've got the weekend off, for a change. A couple of days of slacking will be much appreciated! Went looking for a 12-string guitar today, which I intend to buy as soon as my next paycheck arrives. The hottest candidate is a semi-acoustic  urlLink Godin A12 . Can't wait to get my hands on a beauty like that! :)  Good night
