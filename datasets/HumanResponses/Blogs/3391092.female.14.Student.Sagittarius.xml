      umm okay wow sorry i havent writtin in a while i have been to tired with decorating and plannin the dance and i havent been home '  Monday: we were sittin in period and pagel waited til the last 10 minutes to say who made bella voce... so then he goes all the girl come down (to the floor) and so we did and lizzie goes im about to pee my pants and pagel goes... GOOD! and so he starts reading off names in alphabetical order and then he gets to kylies name and goes there two more..... ChRiStInE qUiRk and carly richardson!!!! and then we were all happy and like yay yay yay lol so YES i MADE IT!!! next year is gonna rock!!!!    Tuesday: i dont really remember ne thing that happened on tuesday besides having matt roll out a piece of paper like the whole hallway long!!!! haha it took him all period!!! oh yeah i remember now it was our student council dinner and we all got dressed up and then after it was over we went and saw mean girls for my second time!!! pass that dutch pass that dutch... lol and then me kayla and melissa went to gvhs to get physicals well me and kayla got them not melissa... that took like 2 hours and i sware like 197 people came and asked us why we were all dressed up!!!! ahh it got so annoying!!!  Wednesday: i went to kaylas and made signs and junk for the dance.... you know those 3 large pictures that were on the bleechers and it had a sign that said vegas lights over it???? yah i made that and it took me 2 hours!!!!!!!!! lol  Thursday was the dance!!! finally it was here telling us school would be out in 3 more days! and we will be in high school!!!!! so i got out of school along with all the other dance commitee people after 4th period and we walked down to the rec. the dance looked pretty good in my opinion!!! who knows!! but it took so much planning and it turned out to be a fun dance.. well for the people who showed up and came!!! (like 100) lol thats kinda sad but it was fun.....we all found rides and went to in and out burger and ate there and then got rides down to kylies house and chilled there dancing playing video games and just hanging out!! then me and kurtis ended up going on a walk and talking for like an hour and 1/2..... everyone thinks we hooked up but we didnt just TALKED!!!! lol but it was fun!!!!

Thursday: Okay finally today well i woke up and my brother was downstairs on the couch and i was upstairs and he yelled for me to come to the stairs so we could talk and then i was in the kitchen lookin for something to eat and then i go "hey dan do you realize that theres a jamba juice up there" and he was like "yeah... no S***" and blah blah and then he told me i was fat and that i should walk down there and get a smoothie cuz i havent like excersised in FOREVER... so i walk down there and its like drizzling... it only took like 3 minutes to walk up there and then i walked back and yeah. When my dad got home he asked me to sign him up for this one thing online and i didnt know how and he was like who r u on the fone with and i go joe and he was like oh well ur on the fone with joe your useless and he was just being a dickhead. and then like he just left and went food shopping and he came home and i was like why didnt you take me and he goes cuz u were on the fone and i go so i could of hung up and he was like well i didnt think of it and like i had told him yesterday to not go shopping with out me cuz he doesnt buy any food that me and my brother EAT! and like hes so fucking gay he goes "then go shopping by urself tomorrow" okay how the hell could i go FOOD shopping with no car and no money? ... hes frusterating! and he owes me a 100 bucks!....................................haha my dad is lame he went back and took me shopping to buy what i wanted to eat! lol what a loser  Kayla called me to see what i wanted to do and we decided to go bowling and Joe and his cousin emily came with us. It was hella fun just all hanging out and stuff. Kaylas dad cracked the funniest joke as we were leaving though....good times good times..

      man today was just full of boring... lol that sounded retarded but its true... idiot chase called at like 7:15 in the damn morning cuz he started summer school today and i start next week... and we talked for like 3 minutes and then we hung up and i slept til like 12:30.. then chase called at 1 ... he called all throughout the day but we couldnt get a hold of joe.. i think he was babysitting so yeah..   chase was reading some magazine and it had percentages of peoples thoughts on a lot of different things for example what defines cheating and who wheres the pants in the relationship.... and then we figured out that he wears the pants between him and hailey (if hailey wore the pants nothing would ever be decided lol) and me and chase BOTH wear the pants in our friendship lol we r equal!!!!....  there are plans to see a movie tomorrow at 1;30 and to my notion a lot of people are going but im still undecided to whether or not im gonna go... i guess ill just decide in the morning ..... so whatever!  i talked to aimee today she wants to come home reallie bad! but it isnt like things r remotely exciting here!.... its another boring summer.. im suppose to go to cali the 10th and stay there for a week or two and so thats something to do but i know as soon as i leave ill wanna come home :'( i guess ill just talk to everyone after 9 and on weekends cuz its free then... im out
