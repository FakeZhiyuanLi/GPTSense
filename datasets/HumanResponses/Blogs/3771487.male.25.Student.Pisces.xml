      Whew !! What a day! Drove at 10am to college - and the sun almost drove me crazy with the heat. And what have I been doing since morning - coding - what else ! Trying to make this stupid computer to do my bidding is not easy. But atleast my new LCD flatpanel Samsung syncmaster monitor looks absolutely stunning :-)) - so I am staring at something good !

What are other people doing around me - the same as me - coding :-O (what kind of cursed place is this !!) hehehe ... well thats life for a grad student - every body is working on their little baby ofcourse as am I. hmmm - between all this I managed to catch a few glimpses of the trailer of king arhtur n van helsing - how r the movies? has ne one seen them?

Time to wrap up the day - plan to laze around for the rest of the evening - mmm the very thought of it is relaxing. And ppl who are following the euro - arent the checs playing sum smashing futbol ....

ciou evbd.

      Hi,

This is not my first into writing some sort of a diary - but I always give up - someway, sometime in the middle of it all the chaos of my existence I always give writing. Well ... here's another attempt - lets hope it manages to sustain itself through ....

Let me introduce myself - I am Parag. and I am 25 and from Delhi, India (why would anybody want to know that - I have no idea!!)
What do I do - well I tinker around with computers, read a lot, draw a little, play a little, and I talk a whole lot more though finding listners is tough most of the time ... And I like to find out stuff about various countries, and to travel their many cities and to know people and .... (how many of you are still reading this :-) ).

Though I must confess I havent been anywhere much yet - most of my own country is quite a mystery to me still (as if anybody else has a clue what it is all about (lol)... but I plan to find out someday 

well, now thats that.
... and surely more coming up later.

      I was really impressed by this movie and so I decided to read the book by Sylvia Nasar. Its not an easy book to read and I've taken about 2 months to finish it - but I must say the effort was worth it. I am not super good as far as mathematics is concerned, never was infact, but I do appreciate it a lot better now than I used to. But the book just bowled me over as I came to realize the sheer genius of the man (John Nash). I've had a chance to see the man for real, when he came to Delhi for a game theory conference. He seemed a mere shadow of the character which Russell Crowe portrayed in the movie. But the book taught me so much more - he has done some phenomenal amount of work and I only thought he did his Nash Equilibrium and non cooperative games stuff ! 
 The book is tragic, inspiring and heartwarming at the same time. Kudos to Ms. Nasar for writing some great stuff. Anyone who's loved the movie ought to read the book and do not let the maths deter you - the spirit and courage of the genius which shines through the book will help bridge that gap ......

      In the last few months atleast a dozen of my friends got married - what is the matter with folks out there?
 I've seen it happen to one of my colleagues - from the moment he got married, he's walked the razor's edge.
 He does that fine balancing act between buying groceries for home and solving some uber complex math problem everyday. I've seen him stay up nights, working and hacking away at a keyboard just to get some sensible numbers on a screen while still not forgetting to sms his sweetheart every 30 mins because she feels lonely at home. Ask him anytime and he'll advise you not to marry ..... ever ! 
 But then there I times when I see them together and there's that momentary glint in both their eyes and a feeling of bliss on their faces which makes me wonder ! Perhaps even this not so utopian marriage has something special which misses the onlooker's eye .... May all my friends find that something to keep them and their marriages going lifelong.
 Cheers !!
