      St. Louis Cathedral loomed against the inky night sky. I sat and looked on its proud and tall frame through the window of the jolting carriage. Gabrielle and Solange's excited and happy voices drowned out the sounds of the night, the clip-clop of horses hooves, the conversation on the street, and even the chiming of the church bells tolling the hour as dusk gave way to night.    ******    Solange and Gabriella seemed positively at home here on this ballroom, promenading through the vast room, their arms intertwined, faces partially hidden beneath the fans.  They laughed aloud and teased the young men that had gathered here.  I couldn't help but laugh to myself.  They were doing exactly what they were trained to do.  But suddenly, that no longer seemed the right thing.  Something

      "Adèle, did you observe my conduct with this man?" Mamma asked, looking at me pointedly.  Indeed, I had. It had fascinated me beyond all comprehension. It was not something one did in the street in full view of the public, and I had noticed it had exposed Mama to impertinent remarks in passing as well as some disdainful looks. Mamma had not seemd to noticed them herself, so engrossed was she in the man's company, and he had been only too delighted in returning the attention.

      "To become what you are?! A rich man's whore?! A white man's slave?!" she exclaimed, he eyes wild with excitement and rage.  Through it all Mamma remained calm, her eyes never leaving Daniella's eyes, standing proud and erect, her hands clasped together and settling on the front of her beautiful satin gown.  Daniella stalked in front of my mother like a cat sizing up its prey, her bosom heaving with emotion. Mamma's face remained immobile, no hint of what she was thinking or feeling daring to show itself. This, in itself, seemed to calm Daniella and suddenly she turned her back.  "It is not to be borne, Dominique. Renèe will lead and honest life and earn an honest living as I have done. I have seen firsthand what your life can do to a woman. The only result is ruination and despair," she finished, and her tone couldn't have been more ominous had it been death itself.  I squeezed the hand that had been inserted into mine for support and looked into Renèe's face. Her eyes were cast to the ground but her jaw was set in determination.  "This was wrong of me, Adèle," she whispered to me now. "I should not have involved you or your family. I am sorry."  "Do not be sorry," I replied gently stroking her cheek.

      Mamma never faltered during those outings, always keeping her head held high, even as white women and children crossed the road to get away from us, and sometimes even their slaves, looking down their noses at us with disdain. I never quite understood their gestures, their eyes that spoke volumes about just what they thought of us and our place in the world. I did not remember a time when this was not commonplace, yet I could never remember exactly when I began to notice and care either. Certainly we were dressed no different than the white folks, our dresses just as fashionable, the fabric just as lovely and new and certainly we never wanted for anything our hearts desired. Outwardly, we seemed to be on their level financially. Our manners and our decorum were as genteel as those who lived in great plantations and who dined in the first circles, those who were pillars of Louisiana society and who were well respected in the community. We were no different.  What a fool I was back then for truly believing that. To have believed everything my mother ever told me about life and our place in it. For there was one vital element to our being that separated us from all the rest. The color of our skin.

      I do not know how long it was this gentleman had been staring at me before I realized it. But suddenly, my eyes found his. He was standing across the street, waiting, it seemed, for the traffic of carts and buggies to pass before crossing it himself. He was handsomely dressed in brocade and velvet, with fine Italian lace at his throat. His hair was black as night, the gray just beginning to touch at his temples. He had olive complected skin and fierce green eyes that were intense as he stared at me. Ordinarily, I would have felt pride at such a man taking notice of me, the childhood vanity that Mamma had instilled in me rearing its head. I was just beginning to feel the power I held over men and knew I was striking. I began to smile at him and flirt with my eyes but something about this man held me. It was recognition. His stance was familiar along with the high cheekbones and strong, prominent chin. Even his hand, which was gently resting on the bodice of his stylish coat was familiar to me.  I racked my brain trying to remember who he was but absolutely nothing came to me. Just then, a young man approached him and regretfully, it seemed, he tore his gaze from mine. The two of them conversed briefly on the street and it was then I decided to bring him to Mamma's attention to see if she recognized him. She was deep in conversation with an old black woman beside a produce stand. I patiently waited for them to finish, the conversation ending with Mamma placing some coins into the old woman's hand and bowing to her to which the old woman responded with an enthusiastic, "Bless you, ma'am, bless you!"  Mamma turned to me and in hushed tones I described the man across the street. She casually looked into the direction I had pointed. I felt her spine stiffen and her face became suddenly hard. Just as quickly, her face softened and melted into a warm smile. I realized she knew this man. I turned my eyes back to the man, still standing where I had seen him a moment before. He was still with the young man, both of them now looking in our direction. The same warm smile played out on his lips and he was staring at Mamma just as intently as he had stared at me. They seemed to be having a conversation with only their gaze. Finally, Mamma bowed a curtsy and took me by the arm, leading me away.  "Mamma, you knew that man?" I asked trying to keep up with her quickened pace.  "Yes, dear," she replied but added no more. I got the feeling she would abide no more questions here on the street and so I waited until we were home until I approached her again.
