      So I finally found a school that  one:&nbsp;I like two: offers the subject that I like three: offers that subject under a degree heading that NASA will allow UTTERLY FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!  How does Master of Engineering in Applied Remote Sensing and Geoinformation Systems sound?&nbsp; Pretty groovy!&nbsp; And the best part.....to move from South Carolina to Michigan will cost me less than 300.00.&nbsp; That's almost half of what I paid moving from Mississippi to South Carolina and that was 200 miles shorter that the Michigan trip. WHOA!&nbsp; So I am, needless to say, extremely excited over this change in events.&nbsp; Now I just have to go home and check my official NASA AST listing to see if that works.&nbsp; I will also have to contact Marco, the head guy in the Earth Science Application Directorate (ESAD) to see if they would consider a flip/flop co-op rather than a parallel.&nbsp; It's possible. (we can hope!)&nbsp; Also, I need to check with my grant lists to see if there are any for that particular area.&nbsp; (prayers...............many prayers)&nbsp; ;)

       Well...I'm officially done with my project and now it's time for the really hard stuff.&nbsp; Now I have to work on my paper (ugh).&nbsp; Luckily, I am using the team powerpoint presentation and I can create my posterboard from that. yeah!!!!&nbsp; But now I'm seriously at a roadblock on this paper thing.&nbsp; I have 23 pages worth of notes from what I did this summer step by step plus the powerpoint presentation and even Margot's master's thesis for help.&nbsp; But I am still drawing a blank.&nbsp; I know what I want to say but I just don't know how to start.&nbsp; SO FRUSTRATING! >:(

      Well this week is going well!! lol&nbsp; I just paid my tuition and fees for the fall (3308.00 to be exact) and I had the thought that I would add 500.00 onto my Carolina card for my books....so I am currently out of pocket..... 3808.00.&nbsp; That leaves me with 4700.00 to pay off my back rent and find a new place (major UGH)...but Forrest is my baby and I love him...so a new place I will find.

       So...on continues my good week.&nbsp; So, I finished my soil protocol class which means that I am certified in two subjects to teach K-12.&nbsp; Although in the eyes of the trainers, I am in graduate school.&nbsp; The faculty that introduced the classes to us informed them of that so that we could participate (they needed bodies) and also that we were teachers (TAs, I guess) so that we could get the  really cool  binders&nbsp;and stuff.&nbsp;  Anyway... what was really cool was that I was offered a job at Virginia State during my training.&nbsp; One of the faculty, Shoeba, told me I needed to come there and take her place (totally COOL!!!).&nbsp; She wants someone she can train before she retires.&nbsp; Of course, I'd have to finish grad school first and then I could get my Phd while studying under her.&nbsp; But it's always an option.&nbsp; I figure I'll work and finish school and then I'll give her a call and ask if she is still looking for a replacement.&nbsp; It might be fun and she is also the Grand Master when it comes to getting grants....so there is much that I can learn from her.&nbsp; I am excited!!!! Hopefully next week will be just as fantastic!

       Just a bit of good news for everyone.&nbsp; I have completed my class on&nbsp;hydrology protocol with GLOBE.&nbsp; I am now certified to teach hydrology to kids K-12.&nbsp; I will be getting a certificate for hydrology and for soils (which I'm taking tomorrow).&nbsp; These should total my NASA certificates to 6.&nbsp; That is so COOL!

       Today was AWESOME!!!!!!!&nbsp; I talked with the Geography guy who's here at NASA from USM (University of Southern Mississippi) and asked him if there would be a possibility that I could do some research for USM from USC.&nbsp; He started to balk at the fact that if I didn't go to USM for my graduate work, then they would be out of grant money.&nbsp; So I told him that money wasn't important....just the fact that I would be conducting research would be enough.&nbsp; It nearly&nbsp;BLEW his mind.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Also, he introduced me to the gentleman who will be teaching the GIS/Remote Sensing classes here on site and it turns out that he just graduated (in May) from USC with his Phd.&nbsp; So we had plenty to talk about.&nbsp; Then it turns out that the Geography guy graduated from KU (BOOOOO!!!!)..lol... so we got to talking about Kevin Price (who was his advisor) and his research projects.&nbsp; Totally cool
