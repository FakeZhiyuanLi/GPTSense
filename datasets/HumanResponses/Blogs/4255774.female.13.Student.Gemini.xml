         lemme tok abt yesterday 1st k? it was the last dae of my damn-unenthu-day-no-staying-over-due-to-safety-problems "camp" (or so they claimed). aniwae todae at least its better as they had tis game called treasure hunt which allows u to go luking for clues which was a type orf logo and lyk you have to go and draw it out and list which logo is it. ya... we ran around the skool and we hid the clues in a secret place lohx....it was so god damn fun. lolx...i dunno whether we won a not but our instructor claimed that we got first...whatever. ya. dan later i had lunch wif my beloved sj squadmates cheryl and adie and we ate yong tau foo.... dan we saw chee hoe at the drinks stall and he was so nice; he waved to us and even offered to pay for our drinks. but in the end i dunno whether he got really pay for us not.. dan later after having lunch we were walking out of the school with some of the camp instructor in front of us and adie got real violent like she has alwaes been and i said " childish freak" at her... dan the instructoe in front tot i was toking about him and he turned around and dan by tt time i adie and cheryl were like laughing lyk shit so i guess the instructor really tot that i was toking about him... hahax. dan we followed him to the bus station and i just couldn't stop laughing... dan later the instructors heard me laughing so loud he turned around again...lolx....it was so funny lohx... ya dan letr i went to swensens and ate the topless 5 which was on tis really reasonable offer... in celebration of its 139th anni.. i think.and dan i adie and cheryl fooled around. it was sooo fun! dan later i went home on bus 17 and slept on the bus again... i;m a sleeping freak lohx...aniwae i did lahx...      todae!      todae i had routine training for sj and its really tiring. our seniors made us run around the school with 6 logs shared among 25 ppl... its chao tiring! dan they made us do 2 sets of 20 burpees, half squats, crutches and pumpings....it was like...my hands were shivering and shivering... dan we did 700 circuit pumpings. saio... they kept saeing we din straighten our backs but we did k.... just that i think some of us didn't.... bleh. dan we had footdrill, marching around the science block doing homats and stuff...like homat on the ,march and they sorta perfected our drill....lolx. footdrill rawk! i like footdrill. i dunno why some ppl like fandi keep saeing that footdrill sucks. she just doesn't knoe how to appreciate it. its like, she can never understand the sort of unity that keeps us going rather than her co which just sits around in an air con room playing your instrument. i'm not trying to point out that co is not good, but its like i'm sure if we make them join us in just 1 of our pts they won't be able to take it. and ya, these kind of ccas don't have that kind of unity that uniform groups haf... they dun go thru thick and thin together...they dont sweat and suffer and enjoy together... thats the difference that i see in sj that makes me so enthu abt it... k.... crap.   dan later we went to swensens again and we had topless 5 again...dan i went home to watch lee jia wei's match against that korea gal and found out that i was real disappointed lohx. jw had such a good chance of winning yet she lost. that korea gal is a bitch. she keeps screaming words in her lang. whenever she wins or starts a ball. crap! narth korea sucks!!!!!!!!! bleh.
