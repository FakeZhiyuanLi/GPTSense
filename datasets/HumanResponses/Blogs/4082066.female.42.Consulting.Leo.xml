       the doctor told me to get some ice and sit with foot up. i knew peter (my mgr.) wasn't going to take this well. i got a note from the doctor (for peter) and an appointment to return in 2 weeks to check my progress. i wasn't supposed to work for that 2 weeks. i was living paycheck to paycheck at this point. our store was floundering so i wasn't getting enough hours to live on as it was! good thing about working for a corporation is the benefits. i applied for short term disability (S.T.D.) right away since it takes some time and  tons  of paperwork. i was still waiting to hear on that when it was time to go back to the doctor.    if i had a penny for every time someone asked me "  how  did you do this again?" i would have more pennies than i could easily carry around. i wish i had a much better story of how this happened. i even tried to pass one off . the problem with it was anyone who knew me would start laughing after my opening sentence. here, let me show you. "so i was in this one night stand..." i told you before i'm a terrible liar.   when i went back to the doctor he couldn't belief my lack of progress. he asked "the question" at least twice and sent me away with a slip to get another x-ray and a referral to an orthopedic surgeon. he also gave me another note for peter extending my time off for another month. he wanted to get me into P.T. but felt we needed to do more healing first.   before i was to see the othro doc he referred me to radiology for an M.R.I.. the purpose of a M.R.I is to look for signs of muscular and bone damage a regular x-ray wouldn't show. i know you are all wondering so i will just say yes. each person i saw in the progression of healthcare providers asked "the question" in near disbelief. the more time that passed it took on a comical quality.   by the time i saw othro doc it had been about a month since that fateful day. he wanted to get me back on both legs and back to work so he had me fitted for a walking cast. he gave the okay for P.T and wanted to see me in a month. things were getting back to normal or so i thought. work rejected my walking cast for safety and health code reasons. CRAP!! i couldn't return to work until i could do so without my cast.   thankfully around this time my S.T.D. kicked in and i could pay rent. lots of phone time and paperwork involved but i'm thankful i had this. it didn't pay the amount i was used to but it was something!   my life as i was used to it changed drastically from that day forward. being the independent gal i am suddenly needing to rely on others for simple things was hard. some can give testimonials that i would borderline on difficult at times. hard to believe i know. :) since then i have had to change the way i do things and give up some things i really enjoy. it's okay 'cause i'm still standing- just differently.

       as i already said i had a  blast  monday night! one of the reasons was the fact that people seemed to put their personal conflicts aside and came together for the evening. i know when you have a small diverse group not everybody is going to get along all of the time. especially when there is a lot of overlap in their time together. so thank you all for a great evening. i for one needed a night of merriment with people i enjoy and am i comfortable with.    i know i didn't do the promised song but i had my peter brady on! i can safely say that was allergy induced. not sure at this point what could be new or stronger to add to the allergies other than the layer of smog we are getting. one day soon i shall grab that mic and shock you all! in the meantime i keep dodging singing games in shows but would do it if was called for. good or bad sing loudly and proudly. :)   i know i promised details of the evening but in remembering a great evening to those who weren't there can sometimes make it sound sorted. for those who were there nothing that happened was new or different for that gathering. so i shall just leave it at that   i look forward to one day doing karaoke in the bay area with mike and marissa. hopefully one or both will come back to visit and sing. i'm hoping sam will do the same too! you are all missed.

       i try to keep a "the glass is half full" perspective on my life. i have some heavy decisions to make and deal with right now. the reason i'm writing this is to let you know that if i don't seem my usual positive adorable self not to worry. what you can do is send positive energy my way. for some reason 'we' have to be tested regularly by the entity in charge of the universe. to really see what we are made of and how much we can handle without being broken. well, i'm still standing and plan to stay that way! so be honest but kind to me and i will soon have my stuff worked out.    i will have my boys for two weeks starting thursday so be patient if my posts are wacky, few, and almost gibberish. we  are  going to come up with a system of sharing the computer without it turning into a dictatorship. (i hope) kisses to all!

       on march 29th 2004 at 10  : 45 in the morning i was walking home from work. it was a beautiful spring day and i was looking forward to a walk through a big park near by for exercise . i was also taking my camera along in hopes of some cherry blossom shots. work had been uncomfortable but that day i rocked and was in a great mood. i was going over what i needed to gather to get going. there were a couple of cars waiting at the stop sign so i decided to walk a bit closer to my building before i crossed the street. i was almost across from the front door so i went to cross between two cars. they were parked close together so when i stepped down off the curb i stepped on the edge of a hole i didn't see. i  so  didn't expect that. i went down fast and hard. as it was happening i knew i had really messed up. the bag containing my cd player, some cd's, my journal and the small ceramic coffee cup i had just won as a prize went flying (and breaking) all over the street. It's a busy street so i tried in my pain amidst a string of profanity to retrieve my items. one attempt to move and i realized one of my worst fears had come true. the sole bread winner was down!   i have worked hard the last 3 years to be self sufficient. i have not gone out partying on the night before a early morning (early is 3:20am) at work. common sense i know but a lot of my co-workers do it regulary. i would resist buying that awesome pair of shoes that i would love to have but didn't need. i always made sure i had rent and bills covered before all else. Don't give me the sainthood quite yet. what i'm saying is there was nobody around to be my back up. (that's a whole set of stories i will eventually get to) i'm proud of the person i am and evolving into. i have always been and still am a responsible person. yea for me because i had paid the extra for health insurance. in the 1 1/2 years i worked there i never really needed it. some co-workers even had said i should cancel it so i would have extra spending money. i just felt better knowing if i needed it i had it. well i was gonna need it now!   the fire marshal was coming to do an inspection of the sprinkler system in my building. he was freaked out watching me go down and putting sailors everywhere to shame with my string of profanity at a increased volume . he gathered my items and helped me hop to my building. once inside i took it from there and got to my apt. my right knee was bleeding pretty good and i had to get my shoe and sock off while i still could. i was in a lot of pain so i allowed myself a few minutes of crying then i called work to ask if the next person to get off would take me...... wait... where  do  i go? i had no clue since i never had an emergency! i had to play corporate phone transfer til one lady told me my options. that burned up most of the hour i spent waiting for jasmine to show up.    she was new at my store and to portland so i didn't really know her very well. she used the spare keys i kept in my locker to get in my place. she got me advil and cleaned my knee up. she even helped me change out of my uniform! she and her husband drove me cross town to my doctors office. i told them they didn't have to wait for me. i was being fit in so who knew how long i would be. sara, my friend who lived next door, worked over that way and would be getting off about the time i'd probably be done.   the doctor asked me more than once " how did you do this again?" after an exam and x-ray it was determined that i had severely sprained my ankle and had to stay off it for sometime. ouch.

         i'm so glad i made the trip for karaoke because  i had a blast last night! the evening was filled with great music, awesome performances,  cock blocking, fruit flavored drinks, lots of laughter and good old fashion make out sessions. you really can't ask for more than that in one evening! i will get to a more detailed post later but i have to wrestle with the boys for the computer so it may be late tonight or tomorrow. stay tuned to marta's world if you dare. it's not for the faint of heart. :)

       so the same friends i do improv with are also serious karaoke folks. they have play lists and go crazy at a new karaoke venue drooling on the song book. i don't want to call them karaoke snobs but they only do songs they know they can do well and  never  done in humor. i've always thought of karaoke as silly fun. Don't get me wrong, they have lots of fun and support each other but it can cause some performance anxiety to a newbie. i think i have an okay voice. i took choir in high school and sounded good with the other second sopranos.    never in the many months of hanging with these folks have i done a song. at first it was because i was catching up with people. i should mention that this happens in eugene not portland. i wasn't avoiding doing it but it just never happened. i think i did turn in a song once late in the evening but it was too late. then near the end of the walking cast phase of my recovery (yes, another story i will get to!) i had tonsillitis for almost 2 months! they actually threatened to remove them if i didn't get better! grrrr! i couldn't sing for awhile then i could do lower notes but not much else. it wasn't funny like the brady bunch episode when the kids formed a music group. they did it to win money to buy their parents an anniversary present. peters voice started to change a couple days before the contest so greg re-wrote his hit song to accommodate peters crackly voice.   i just sounded bad!    it's been 3 months and i have more of a range but still not great. honestly i think it's allergies more that a need to snip! if we transition into fall/winter and it's still a problem then i'll know. i don't have the lovely health insurance now so...i'll cross that bridge when i have to.   two of the gang moved to california late july. one of them has come back for a week to visit mommy and friends. i hope to make the trip so i can see her at monday night karaoke. she is entertaining and enthuiastic - fun to watch. they are both missed but she can shake it while cranking out a tune. not sure i can do this just now but i'm a crazy spontaneous gal. i might finally do a song such as it will sound. :)

       i figure i should explain the title to this blog. like most things it's longer than one entry so bear with me. my writing style makes some people cringe but keep reading it might grow on you. if not no worries.   three years ago i had to make a hard decision that hurt people i loved. i had to start my life on my own for the first time. my support system (my family) that i thought would always be there withdrew. actually they believed my (then- now ex) husband. this was bizarre since i always tell the truth. i don't have it in me to lie and you can tell from my face if i am trying. i learned that as a small child. i was truly alone and confused. the person who had been a great friend stepped in and was my support. (this is the bigger painful lesson i learned) i felt that i was truly in the fight for my life. "they" kept pushing and punching trying to knock me down and out. things got tough but no matter what (you got it) i was still standing. i went down on one knee more than once but something in me just kept me going. (BTW i used to box thus the fighting metaphors) Don't get out any kleenex because this isn't a sad story. i have had some tough times sure and i have learned some valuable things along the way. the most important things i learned is i'm a strong woman. more than that i learned to trust and believe in myself and like  me   . like any journey you make wrong turns and errors in judgment. i certainly made my share of mistakes and suffered from them but that is why i found the strength to be the awesome, hot, strong, funny and easy going gal i am today!    there is (as always) more to the story. in the coming posts it will all be revealed. after all, i'm an open book.

        after waiting what seemed years but was really only 16 hours i finally get another turn! i love my boys dearly but they are computer nazi's! they don't get that from me. :) to be fair they aren't allowed to use the computer at their house but  come on!!  i'm done ranting for now.   there is so much that wants to come rushing out i don't know where to start! how about a glimpse into how i really do enjoy the simple things? let me start by giving you a bit of back round. i live in a urban apartment . i really enjoy where i am and it was a block from work . the building i live in is a funky old place with big windows, pocket doors and claw foot tubs. the downfall to this place is the apt. sizes available. most are single and double studios with one 1br and a couple 2 br. thrown in for fun. i was lucky enough to get one of the double studios on the corner so i have cross ventilation. mine is also one of the few that haven't been butchered to make it modern. it has been hellishly hot for a week or so making my world uncomfortable. (i dislike being too hot or cold) this morning i woke up to slightly over cast skies. it is cooler and strangely quiet for a saturday. after i started the coffee i moved the areo bed and got out my outdoor folding chair. (my oldest son was still asleep on the only place besides the bed to sit) as i sat down i had a happy feeling. something about the day and the chair reminded me of camping. i got a goofy smile on my face and basked in the good feeling.

        well, i'm not usually one to follow the sheep but in this case i did! it started out innocently enough by getting the site addresses of friends. i would look at their blogs and journals when i remembered to but i soon found myself logging on  just  to view their sites. in fact it got to be a self made frustration! logging on to view the latest and they didn't even have the courtesy to update! then wanting to post comments so i got a user name and  started  but didn't finish setting up a blog of my own. i wondered if people would really want to read my positive quirky outlook on life and could do so without getting sick? so it sat unfinished for a few days, really forgotten until , a friend "traced" my user name to my "in name only" blog. the comment that came out of the blue made me feel i was caught. i gave the lame excuse that i had never made my web page so ..... "you should get on that" okay now i feel i gotta follow through on this since i went  that  far. (for those of you who don't know me i know just enough about computers to be dangerous.) it took me most of a day and TONS of calories burned from frustration! the first seven pages i set up were cool. the next several were okay and the final product is just what i made to get here. actually the page is just a page but cute and useful in it's own right. check it out if you want. that's all for now as two teens are nagging for their (god given) right for a  turn NOW ! welcome to my world.
