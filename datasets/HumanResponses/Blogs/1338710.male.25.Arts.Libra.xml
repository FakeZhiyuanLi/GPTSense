      Please check out Heather Green's site. We have written together on a coupleof great songs. She is an amazing singer/writer who just so happens to be a professional model as well! She can be seen in Diamond Rio's beautiful mess video as well as a film alongside Ewan McGregor. Heather and I recently had the oppurtunity to perform at a songwriters showcase with Michael Garvin, writer of the song "Waiting On Tonight"-Jenifer Lopez. The Acoustic Cafe is a great songwriters showcase. Be sure to check it out some time.

      HEY! in a few days I sould have my mp3 page up and finished. Right now the picture is 4 years out of date and the song on their, well, speaks for itself. BUT you will be able to download my music for free and check out new songs. For those that would like to work over the internet i am also setting up a password only Chat type site with live audio or you can post audio. It's probably stupid but I am becoming more of a geek anyways. I called my brother, the web pirate today, and he "said" adambrowder.com "should" be up in a couple of days. j/k keith nothing but love. THIS SITE WILL STILL BE MY HOMESITE. So its safe to bookmark it.  For all of my friends who interested in working with an amazing female pianist/vocalist let me know. I met her at a song writing competition. My jaw about hit the floor when I heard her voice. Think Sarah M but a lot cooler.I told her I would try and hook her up with some co-writes, so don't make me a look like a liar. I will give her your number or email.  Also I have been writing lots of Incubus/Coldplay stuff with John lately. If anyone has anything like that and would be interested in sharing the love, book me!

      Well, it has been way to long since my last post. Here is what has been happening since my last entry.  I have worked or will work with several new writers:  Gary Nichols - FAME Zach Hacker - FAME Jim Parker - Known for his cuts on John Anderson.  Jimmy Nutt - Another FAME writer whom I hope to work with soon.  I have started a production company currently named M3 Productions:  More Than Ever - A killer rock band with some POP influence.   At this time they are my only group. I hope to have more bands/singers signed up in the near future.  My good friend Phillip Spires recently got a job at ASCAP. Another good friend Heath Butler recently signed a management deal.  I will be in New York Nov. 20 - 23 for writing appointments.   GOD BLESS

      My beautimous girlfriend, " Her Majesty Erin Grace Rogers of York" has to work today. So I thought I would go see a movie since i am sick of play station. I think I am going to go see "The Day After" or something to that effect. It's basically an end of the world, dooms day flick. Gotta love em.   Or I might go see Troy. Even though I heard it sucked, I am still curious to see how bad they portrayed homer's story.  Oh I was in Nashville on business Thurs. I walked down the street to get some sushi in West End. I notice that cop cars are everywhere. I ask around, turns out  President Bush was speaking at Vandy and was about to leave. So by complete accident I saw the President. We ended up sharing  a table and ate sushi together. OK that part was a lie but I did see his motorcade go by. I got pictures to, if only I knew how to post them.......

      Holy crap what a night. This will be a long one so buckle your seat belts and strap on your beer helmet because, wow tonight was, interesting.  Okay, I had a gig tonight. Just a little 3 song deal at a place called Crossroads in Huntsville. I was backing up "Starsky"(changing names to protect the innocent) at this place. We thought it would be a cool little coffee house type thing were people get up and showcase a few songs. You know, the type of crowd that actually knows what a masters degree is and that it has nothing to do with Yoda or ninja movies. We drove about an hour and 45 just to get there. Mind you, we get lost along the way thanks to yahoo maps!   Before I go any further. I grew up playing in the slummiest of Bars in backwards Montgomery, AL at the age of 14. Now keep that number in mind 14. But there you could find some of the most talented blues bands in the south.   So we show up, the place is in a run-down shopping center. Ok. It's not the Ryman but it will work. It's your run-of-the-mill sports bar. Lots of smoke, and lots of beer. No food, just beer. 1 lone pool table with dark, red smoke stained walls. Gettin it yet...... It did have a nice stage and decent sound system. Again, it reminded me of my youth. Out of nowhere I see an old Frat brother running sound, weird. The only other intelligent human there. So we sat down, found out we won't be going on for another 2 hours. I am hungry. Trisha, Martha, and Starsky are as well. So we go to applebees to get some grub. Good food and great service!- This is the only positive high point of the night. We come back, and I get worried. I may be a little snobish and a little bit of a prude at times, but i can't help it. i'm from Shelby County. But I think Bill Clinton would have been offended by the soft-core porn going on in the street. Now John would have loved it.  ----that was for you Starsky, currently Starsky is involved in a relationship with a famous pop star named John.  Big crowd was there now. The opening band  was on stage and we'll,,,,,you see,,,,,um,,,I'm not the best in the world but they sucked! bad!!!!!!! Lord help me, I would have enjoyed hearing the Hung boy fart "she bangs" more than I would have enjoyed that rubbish. It was absolutely barney. I start looking around and I get even more nervous. I look like I stepped out of a Gap catalog. Starsyky looked like a supermodel, trisha was getting her yearwood on and Martha was getting her stewart on. They all looked hot, and in a place like this my metro-sexual, looks more like 'beat his queer ass' .Basically we were surrounded by; mullet toting rednecks, tat covered I'm gonna grind your head with a skate board teenagers, Un-intellectual-intellectuals, a table full of sweet transvestites right next to us, and the wonderfully happy I'm the only person dancing like a jackass but it looks wonderfull to me dancing man. By now I think it's safe to say Martha, Trisha, and starsky were freaked out. I have seen this before, I was cool with it. However the fact that the "Cross Dressing manson family" and "mullet mania were sharing a bar was for lack of better language, "DAMN INTERESTING". Especially when the 'Brittney Spears look-alike dude' requested Johnny Cash. It would have been great if thay had played "MAN in DRAG".   So after painting this picture for you do you think it would have been logical for a songwriter who is metro, who writes mainly Pop stuff in the vaine of ColdPlay, U2, Beatles, and Boy band pop to perform his songs, likewise, do you think it would have been smart for a wonderfully talented pop singer to sing these songs, (who would probably of gotten beaten up by the drags because she looked better than them) I mean we would be following the fat, over 60, just learned a blues scale, off rythym bass, Van-Halen esque tap solo, Classically BAD blues cover band. I mean we would be playing love songs with words like 'Euphoria' and 'Fly' . In guitar tunings that would make them think, "is that queer music" .And they are great songs, they don't need justification. THEY ARE PUBLISHED! I don't work with the people I work with because I suck and sold out. I sold out to becoming talented and so did Starsky. We don't need crap like that not even for fun. I worked my tail off not to be playing places like that ever again. An just to get my snob on, i was better than that crappy band when I was 14!!!! Remember 14! I was so glad Starsky asked if we could leave and not play. That was my first gig to walk out on, and it was worth it.  I'm so thankfull for going though, it was entertaining. It was not a wasted night Starsky or Martha. It was weird. So worth just writing about it in my blog. Please email this link to anyone who might find this stimulating to thier grey matter!

      I would like to think the Academy for all of their support. But most importantly i would like to think Farrah for introducing me to the world of grapefruit juice. Without grapefruit juice I never would have made it this far.  I got schooled today by Luke and farrah at ping pong, but it was worth it.  later

      Why do I get home at 1:30 or so and decide to stay up a while longer and watch tv or surf the web? I think it's just because its the only time I actually get to enjoy beeing home. I work all day and night, then I hang out with Erin, then I come home. So the only quality time I spend home is from 1:00 am to 4:00 am. I'm all out of wack.  It's been a bad week too! Somebody rear-ended my truck. Bunch of crap going down I won't mention to protect the innocent.The fact that Beyonce passed on my song 3 weeks ago, still lengers on me like strong onions from casa. I am a day closer to 26. I want a mini cooper. But that's not gonna happen.   But good things did happen!  1. I played a great gig 2. I got to sleep in yesterday 3. I finally got the new Mac software 4. I lost 9 lbs. then gained 1 which sucked, but I still turned a profit of 8lbs in terms of fat. 5. I got a new pair of black artsy fartsy looking glasses. 6. I bought the Italian Job for $7.95, gotta add it to the list!

      Last night I had to perform at the Acoustic Cafe, songwriters showcase. What a blast! But it wore me out. Most of you probably think I am a woos(never spelled that before??)  for even complaining. Like it takes a lot out of you to play guitar and sing for 2 hours. But it does! So I went to the redneck capital of Florence on my way home,Wal-Mart, to get some more grapefruit juice. Why is it when you are exhausted you see everyone you know. I saw 4 people i was in Frat with in college. Don't get me wrong it was great talking to them. I'm going to play soccer with some of them next week. But  I was tired. So I got home around midnight and slept ruffly 12 hours. Is that to much? I feel guilty about it.  Later   Adam

      It's a movie most people don't have a clue about. To me and about 4 other people, it's the best movie ever made. Val Kilmers best acting ever. Yes it even upstages his oscar worthy top gun role as the "ice man". Yes I my be a complete dork or either you just may be a complete looser for not watching it and loving it.

      It's good to be back home in B'Ham. I love it down here. As much as I try to hide it sometimes, just driving down 280 brings out my inner snob. This part of town is beautiful. It's tuff trying to decide where to live, but Birmingham is one my list of top 10. What is my top 10 places to live, funny you should ask.  1. The Big Apple (the upper west end) or the (Soho district) 2. Downtown  Chicago (up near the peir) 3. Durango, CO (marvelous little mountain town) 4. Disney World (right on main street or next door to the Pirates of the Carribean ride) 5. London (anywhere on Abbey Road) 6. Birmingham, AL (Homewood, Mountain Brook, or where I grew up Inverness/Indian Springs) 7. Canterbury, England (You know the story from Chaucer, I've been there, it's awsome) 8. Denver, CO (It's got climbing, hiking, music, and clothes, what else does a guy need) 9. Gulf Shores (Beautiful white sands, I miss it) 10. Florence, AL (It's really not a bad place, it's rather cute, after all, it's home right now)   My Dad. I love him and I need him. He's taught me so much and been my biggest supporter. He's still teaching me a thing or two about life without me even knowing it. Happy fathers day!

      I love this hair cut. You get up it's done. It takes just one rub of the towel to dry it! And in case you decide to become an olympic diver, it's aerodynamic! What a concept.  You know being 25 sucks sometimes. I'm still young, but not for long. It's an age that forces responsibility and inner reflection. Stupid responsibility, it's over rated sometimes. I miss the days of college when my only worries were exams and grades. It was still safe to dream. Now dreams are constantly in battle with life. Kinda depressing. But my life has always followed a different path. I don't know anything for sure. That's fine with me. I have always been a free spirit. I just know what I love in life and what I want out of it. I am having fun pursuing my dreams. I'm jealous of a stable income at times, but that's just not me I guess. I just need the adventure I think.  "I am afraid of wrinkles, evil ewoks, and bad songs."

      I'll tell you. Flying a delayed flight from New York, a 2 hour drive home, then you discover your keys are at the hotel in New York. Only half a hemisphere away. It was about 1:30 am. Oh so fun.   Just my luck.

      Allright. For those that did not know, I shaved my head. Why? I had a unfortunate incident when I "got my haar did". Who knew my buzzed head would look rock star. I love it to.   SEE NEW YORK part 1 for my first day story.  Part 2  Velvet  Jones (me) a.k.a. Velvet Head, have discovered that New York costs more than my kidneys. The ol' saying I heard fom Eduardo the Magical goes something like this. "You can't step on the sidewalk in New York City without spending $20".  Well it's true, cab's are of the devil and so are restuarants that won't split the bill. My budget quickly dwindled into, out of money for the rest of the month.   I ran out of clothes. I bought new ones. I lugged my guitar all over that city. I never knew gig bags were so wonderfull. Next time I'm taking a picture of a guitar with a cd containg different sounding chords. I'll just hold the picture and press play.  Played a fun little gig at O'flarrety's with starsky. Jason, The chef, The intern, Martha, Rick, Laney, special Ed, Eduardo, James, Maury Povich, and the barkeep were all in attendance. Made 2 new friends, Whitney and J.D. And the 3 blind mice. I saw nothing really touristy. All I saw in N.Y. was cabs, jersey, stores, pavement, urine, street vendors, rich people, poor people, people, more pavement, a few trees, central park, John Lennon's memorial, my money disapear, Elvis Costello, the red head from CSI Vegas, vomit, dogs, buses, and so forth. Got a new ASCAP rep Jason. Cool guy, about the same mental sarcastic wave length as myself. Went to a lot of meetings, wrote some songs, and spent way to much money.   The drip on the air conditioner, oh so much fun at night.  :(  Why do other people not bathe. the b.o. smell was dreadfull.   I loved it.  I hated it.  I can't wait to move there.  I am ready to move out of there already.  Good food.  Great people.  Bad smell.   Places I'm gonna go to and write eventually, Austin, TX. the home of Stevie Ray Vaughn, one of my heros. And eventually L.A. home of, well, really weird people.  For those that went, please post a comment.  Hasta Mananna,  Adam

      Well this past sunday night was definitely full of drama. On my may home from my girlfriends house, I decided to take the scenic route through hell. Metaphorically speaking. I left her house about 11:30 pm. I walk outside and notice that the sky is covered in thick low clouds. It's almost midnight and I can see pretty much everything around me, it looks more like 4:00. It was creepy because I couldn't see the lightning but all the clouds were bright with blue flashes. It wasn't just a flash then darnkess then a flash of blue. It was just blue the whole time. I also noticed it was unusually warm and that the air was really calm. So by now, anyone from the south or midwest would be thinking tornadoes. Well, not me. I just thought man it's about to rain hard.  I remember hearing earlier that it might rain. But I never expected tornados or hurricaine force winds. Living in a town with a huge river you have a tendency to get odd weather patterns and violent storms, but I had never experienced one. I started to get really freaked while driving because I noticed the clouds were getting more violent, I called Erin and told here to check the news. This is when it hits the fan.  2 minutes later I had just passed First Baptist Killen heading back into Florence, when it hit. What I found out later was a 130 mph straight line wind that knocked me off the road and into a little parking lot. I have never seen so much rain. I could barely see a blur of light that was the store 5 feet away from me. Then it happened, Erin called back, she told me there was a tornado warning in the area, and I needed to get back to her house. Clearly the storm was moving east because I ran into it. I was having to yell at her for her to hear me. It was so loud. I told her I would even though I had this ominous feeling I was about to die. I have been held at gunpoint in Europe 3 times, I almost got in a fight and probably shot in Southside, I fell about 30 feet rock climbing one time, but I never actually felt like I was going to die. If there was a tornadoe in my area, then I was probably sitting next to it. From what I have seen on TV that's just how it happens. It's completely calm then the tornadoe appears. So I had no ditch to hide in and now where to go. I knew my little Nissan Pickup couldn't take this just sitting there. So I chose to drive. Right then the transformer above my head exploded and the power in killen went out. The pole it was on was just shaking violently back and forth. I knew any second it would be coming down on top of me. I was scared. I told Erin I loved her and threw the phone down. I shifted my truck into 4 wheel drive, tore across the road through the ditch, and past a stopped car on the road. I started to head east because I felt my only hope was to outrun it enough and find shelter. I could not see a thing. I could only see one dotted line in front of my car. So I had to go slow or risk killing myself. The only light I saw was of blue explosions of the transformers around me and the sparks of the power lines falling around me. The wind just kept tossing me all over the road and off the road. I felt that tornadoe must have been right behind me. I couldn't see it, I only saw black and one little white line. Then I saw an 18 wheeler in  a ditch that I was being blown towards. I didn't see anyone there, so I kept going.   I knew I wouldn't make it to Erin's house so I tried to find Brooks High School. I eventually made it, but as i was heading up to the school when the wind got a hold of me again and I ended up in a ditch again. This time I was stuck for good. I still did not know that it was just straight line winds, I thought it was a tornado. So I got out, grabbed my tire iron in case I needed to bust out a window, and headed for the school. The rain was so hard it washed my contacts into the back of my eyes. Boy wasn't that fun.  Eventually It died down and the Fire department came and pulled me out. My truck had no damage and neither did I!  On my way to huntsville 2 days later, I saw the damage. Huge trees uprooted, trailers turned over, roofs gone, power poles on the ground. And my little Nissan was able to withstand all that, wow. People were killed in that storm. So here's to my truck, cheers!

      Ya, I miss it already. It's hard to beat a free ride and free room for a week at Gulf Shores. Good ol' parents. E-girl and I had a blast. Here's the lo-down: &nbsp; I got a tan for the 1st time in like 4 years. &nbsp; Got the chance to play some great golf with my Dad and Uncle. Freakin' hot though! &nbsp; Saw my 2 cousins from S. Carolina, and 1 from Montgomery. &nbsp; Layed out a lot. &nbsp; Went to a beautiful private beach in Fort Morgan! &nbsp; Ate a "cheeseburger in paradise" at Jimmy Buffet's sister's resteraunt. &nbsp; Ate at my favorite place, Sea&amp;Sud's, on the pier. &nbsp; Ate lots of SeaFood. &nbsp; Got a chance to float around in the ocean with my friends, Coors Light and Corona. &nbsp; Drove some Go-Carts with the Cousins at "The Track". &nbsp; Played some mini-golf at Alvin's Island. &nbsp; Ate a lot, or did I mention that already. &nbsp; Sweated a lot! &nbsp; Almost got struck by lightning. &nbsp; Someone stole my flip-flops. ( I will find you, hunt you down, beat you with your own arms. Because, ganckin' someone's $14 pair of flip flops is stupid. Freakin' clepto de flip flop.)    &nbsp;  Lots of other crap happened to, but it's almost 2am and I have to drive home in 7 hours. So goodnight!!!!    &nbsp;  OH YEAH, I'M GOING TO BE AN UNCLE TO LANEY NICOLE BROWDER.We will be expecting her at the 1st of december. One of the 1st things her cool (only) Uncle Adam is going to teach her, is how to smile when she makes a poopie. I'm so excited.    &nbsp;  Later,    &nbsp;  ME

      Well, I'm a total cyber geek now. I have an  AIM account, actually I-chat. Same thing though. Anyways......What a rainy weekend here in Northwest Alabama. Played a gig yesterday in searing humidity, then I got rained on. Lots of fun. Today went to go watch a great band(cadencemusic.net), some friends of mine play at a July 4th thing. Of course it rained and it was pretty nasty. I have this problem now, it's NOT like local celebrity, it's more like, I can't go some where without people knowing what I do. So I got ropped into judging a radio station talent contest thing.  "Mr.S" Handed me a sheet and said here man judge this thing for me I gotta go do a soundcheck. It was atleast "entertaining" in a humorus way. Anyways, gotta go. I gotsta drive to Nashville and work tomorrow.  "I don't know, 9"  Adam

      On my way back from Huntsville tonight, my girl and I see a wreck. Some guy crashed his truck in a ditch. I role my window down and ask if he's ok. He looks fine. He says "no" then walks to Erin's side and opens the door. That makes me mad. I'm about to ahnilate this guy when he says "man can you give me ride, I gotta get outa here before the cops show up". I told him no. That's clearly his problem and not mine. I especially don't need a drunk guy laying in the back of my truck. Thankfully he shuts the door before I throw it in gear and pull off.  I would have locked the doors had I expected that! I hope he went to jail.
