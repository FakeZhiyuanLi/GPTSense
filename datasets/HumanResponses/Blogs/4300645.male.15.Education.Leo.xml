      Earlier today Tiger Woods finished 2nd at the NEC Invitational four shots behind the leader Stewart Cink. Tiger shot a -1 69 today and stayed ranked #1 in the world where Vijay Singh, Ernie Els, and Phil Mickleson were all out of the top 40. Tiger finished the four day tournament at a total of -7 under par and seems to have his game under more control than in the past few tournaments.  My question: Has Tiger got out of his slump? Is he finally starting to get back up to where he can play? Should we look for a win in the next few tournaments? It all remains to be seen

      As of this very minute the war in Iraq has costed the U.S. over 128 billion dollars, only a little over one billion coming from the Kansas economy. Instead of the war the U.S. could have fully funded anti-hunger programs for 5 whole years. The U.S. could have also fully funded world wide AIDS programs for 12 years. The war currently costs every single person in the U.S. $457. The state of Kansas could have hired over 20,000 more teachers if we would have not entered the war. Another thing that Kansas could have done is hand out more than 27,000 scholarships to four year students entering or already in college. Just something i thought was interesting to read. site:  urlLink www.costofwar.com   Do you support the war still?? Or if you didn't, are you more against it now??

      Im not sure about this whole  topic about  Tiger coming back to get back on top of his game to start bringing in the major wins again. Today at the NEC Invitational Stewart Cink pulled ahead two more strokes in front of Tiger by shooting  two under to take him to -11. Tiger is still holding down the two spot though along with Chris DiMarco and David Toms all hanging around at -6. The real test is yet to come. Tommorow can Tiger storm from behind and get back to the top or will he have to settle for second? Perhaps he will play bad and not finish top ten. Only one person can decide that, and he is the son of Earl Woods. Lets go Tiger, Sunday is your day.

      Lately in emails and several blogs i have seen there are many people taking every shot they can at the current prestident. Well, let's look at some of the positive things he has done. First of all he caught the most dangerous leader of terrorism in SW Asia and has taken the first step to moving democracy over there. Also i see people who catch one or two quotes from him that sound wrong or are incorrect or misinterpreted. My question to them is ---- Can you speak 100% of your words correctly in front of several live cameras and thousands of people sitting there....no?....then back off..... sure not everyone will agree with everything that the prez does but u cant go so far as to say that he has made the country hell or that the country of the free is gone.....the U.S. is still the most opportunistic places in the world even now....so to all you bush haters....get used to it .....he's here for 4 more years ----Vote Bush-------

         I   n a recent survey conducted by myself i have noticed more and more of the community of halstead going out of town to meet and some date the opposite gender. Two years ago to the start of last school year there were only a few maybe two people per class even actively involved with other towns. Then soon after...there was an "anti-halstead boom" that hit the community as more and more people suddenly became seriously involved with a person that was not in the school district.....     My question is that is this just me over analyzing or do i make a legit. argument?

        I n the second round of the NEC Invitational Stewart Cink was one to be reckoned with. He started the extremely long day with two consecutive birdies. It looked like a runaway until Tiger came storming back from behind. Then the reains came down and the greens became slow.But that had no effect on Tiger, who before the delay ended on 3 straight bogeys. Then he came back focused as ever and knocked in 3 birdies and missed another by just a tad, which brought him back within three shots of the lead due to Cink's boget from the sand. Tiger said he just wanted to make a couple birdies to get back into the mix so three was a bonus getting him back to -6. Can Tiger get back on top of his game with a win here? Can he lengthen the difference between him and Ernie Els for the #1 spot...the next two rounds leave us wondering........................what will Tiger do next?

      This morning i woke up at 4:00 in the morning becuase i could not breathe, literally. Something in the night caused my asthma to flare up and I woke up struggling for air. After several attemps to slow my breathing down and several attempts at sleep my mom came in because she heard me. We went in to the doctor got my breathing under control and got an x-ray of my chest. The doctor said that my lungs were "cloudy" and that id have to take steroids for a couple weeks just to get healthy again and that was my wonderful start to the day!!
