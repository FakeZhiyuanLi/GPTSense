During sleep the brain in humans and other mammals undergoes a characteristic cycle of brain-wave activity that includes intervals of dreaming. b. A period of this form of rest. c. A state of inactivity resembling or suggesting sleep; unconsciousness, dormancy, hibernation, or death. now think about what i just said to you, and do one of the about, and its not hibernation!

PLEASE!! im a starving(well not really but you get my point) artist thats in college, and im LAZY! #4 PAIN, i hate it.. period. people say that pain is just weakness leaving the body, well fuck people, that must mean that im losing like 1000 weaknesses a day, is that like gaining weight? cause for me, thats really fucking hard!(although i do weigh like 178lbs, but thats not the point) #5 OMG! religion, its just annoying in the first place, i know i've said this before, but honestly, its just a(no offence ment by this, nothin against religious people....yet again, bear with me, im tired) psycho-samatic disorder, it needs to die, and we are the ones who need to kill it... #6 finally, people that dont wanna know other peoples oppinion,  OPINIONS ARE LIKE ASHOLES, EVERYONE HAS ONE, AND THEY ALL STINK, GET THE FUCK OVER IT ALREADY!!! ...ok that is all  ZE END!!
