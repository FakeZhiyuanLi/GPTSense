      CB1 is a nice malay drama and the casting are not bad. one of the cast,julia is just like me,who is idolise her idol too much, and the CB2 isnt that good compare to CB1.One of the cast,farhana is daring to say "i love you"to the person she loves.She is lucky cos the guy finally admit that he like her too.Lucky her!How i wish to be like her,i mean her brave and her luck.Anyway,it is just a plain drama,the drama should have 16 episod but have to cut down to 14.

      The day i met him... he ask me to take care of myself,be good and what am i taking after this,did i come there alone? so many questions....all this while,he never ask me all this, only that day.He seems very concern.When i was about to go home,He told me to take care &amp; be extra careful when going back home cos its already midnight. :)hazrul seems to know about it,he know that i am gonna waiting for him, maybe from his mum.(i already met her at pp7)when i take a photo with him ,he tell us to be closer a bit,how much closer? weird....
