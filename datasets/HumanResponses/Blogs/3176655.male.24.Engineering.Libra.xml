      If I had a band I'd call it "Boy Rogers," in reference to the Bob's Big Boy/Roy Rogers rest stops in Jersey...  'cause they suck...  and so would my band.

      Well...  I hate to say it, but life is getting back to normal.  This is not to say that I have forgotten, but life must go on.  We need to repair.  And I am doing this by trying to get some finances in order.  We all know, the best way to deal with things you can't controll is deal with those things that you can.  And we all know, I suck at finances.  But Microsoft Money is my new best friend.  I just stare at it.  There must be a law agains having hours of fun looking at different pictoral representation of the same information... my debt. but it makes me happy.  It's sad...  I'm such a loser right now.  The highlight of my day is entering my credit card purchases, and itemizing my paycheck.  Damn I need a boyfriend.  Well, maybe later, now it's money for me.  I mean... a boyfriend doesn't graph my expected net worth over the next decade... a boyfriend doesn't figure out how much of my Amex payment goes to principle...  a boyfriend doesn't keep you warm at night... wait... nevermind.  Maybe I just need to hook up with a cute accountant.  So also on this weeks agenda was the acquisition of a certain CD.  Ben Folds' new album came out last tuesday and I didn't feel it was responsible of me to go buy it when the country was in turmoil (actually I plum forgot, but now I didn't).  It rocks.  I love that boy and his wacky narrative lyrics.  One of the songs (seen below) makes me so excited for when I'll feel those things he talks about.  It kicks my ovaries into overdrive... wait... nevermind.  Damn! I need a man!  THE LUCKIEST  I don't get many things right the first time.  In fact I get told that a lot.  Now I know all the wrong turns and stumbles and falls brought me here.  And where was I before the day I first saw your lovely face?  Now I see it every day.  And I know that I am...  I am...  I am...  The Luckiest What if I'd been born 50 years before you in a house on a street where you live.  Maybe I'd be outside as you passed on your bike; would I know?  And in a wide sea of eyes.  I see one pair that I recognize.  And I know that I am...  I am...  I am...  The Luckiest I love you more than I have ever found a way to say to you.  Next door there's an old man who lived to his 90s then one day passed away in his sleep.  And his wife, she stayed for a couple of days and passed away.  I'm sorry I know that's a strange way of telling you that I know we belong.  That I know that I am...  I am...  I am...  The Luckiest

      How do we move on now?  How do we live?  We must endure, and we know we will… but how?  I believe that the majority of us feel that some sort of war is eminent.  Maybe so, but where does that leave us civilians?  How do we support our country in our greatest capacity.  I work in a part (albeit small, but vital) of defense.  But being such a new member to this group, am I better suited for a military position?  I spoke with a friend of mine and she shuttered at the idea, although understanding my reasons…. I mean how could you not.  Our beautiful country is hurting, and she needs help.  I only hope that I will step up and help her in the most productive facility in my power.    So I have pondered whether the Army corp. of engineers is the place where I could do the most good in backing our great nation.  I am not the most physically adept person, but I consider myself fairly intelligent, and resilient.  Don’t get me wrong, I’m not running out tomorrow to enlist, but I am considering it, not as a career, but rather as an aide to America in its time of need.  How could I not?  When children are afraid of visiting grandparents, and grown men are afraid of what’s around the corner, action needs to be taken, and, as we’ve been told, it will be.    I only hope that they’ll take me…  I won’t deny my sexuality, but I do wish to help my country.  I’m sure many homosexual Americans agree with me in saying that we are hurting just as much as the rest of America (contrary to what Falwell’s recent interview on the 700 club may have referenced).  Obviously the future weeks will shed some light on this.      I attended a candle lighting vigil tonight at the Lincoln Memorial, and it was breathtaking.  To see all those people grieving was incredible.  To see thousands with candles is powerful enough, but to see them with our Nation’s capitol and most beloved memorials as their backdrop was immaculate.  It was inspiring to say the least, drawing upon those long since dormant feelings of patriotism that we put in drawers for days marked on the calendar marked with stars…  Well every day is marked with a star; it just took a little pointing to notice them…     Well, the stars are out tonight.

      Humor is my primary tool for dealing with various circumstances, but it seems that humor fails me in response to today's events.  I, as all Americans, feel saddened and enraged, but simultaneously guilty for having these feelings since neither I nor any of my closest friends and family members did not perish in these incidents.  I have lived, or in the case of northern Virginia: still live, in all of the areas that were unfortunately ravaged, and continue to have ties with their residents.  Thankfully my loved ones are accounted for; I grieve for those who are not.  Perhaps the most frightening thing about the occurrence as a whole is the horrific beauty in its execution and efficacy.  The poetic nature of the elements of the attacks chills me.  Today’s date, 911, already a pop culture siren of fright will ring more poignant in subsequent years.  While use of United and American vessels as tools of destruction will forever seem oxymoronic, for to me they will always mean peace and love.  Throughout the course of today I choked back tears mulling over how our dearest value, freedom, was literally and metaphorically removed when air travel ceased, and as Americans our wings were clipped.  It is times like now, and during tragedies such as this when I deplore my lack of faith…  But then I realize that I have faith, not in a higher power, but in my country, and in the nature of its occupants, my fellow Americans.  Faith that I AM living free and just, no matter what transpires.  Faith that, as an entity, our reaction will be swift: and faith that it will be just.  I gain comfort in the fact that we shall endure, and await the time when humor returns as my staple coping mechanism, but until then I just don’t feel like laughing. My love to all of you…  If tears could only repair the damage…

      Warning: If you know me and are friends with Erica, this is nothing new. (This is something I wrote for my friend Erica's site.  But that was before I had one of my own...  Ehh, shuttup I'm starved for material.)  Do you ever come up with something out of the blue... find it funny... and then analyze the crap outta how your brain made that connection? Well, I do... All the time. Okay I'll lay it out for you.  I have a problem with money... well, it has a problem with me. I mean it hates me. Soon after I make friends with the dead presidents, they file for divorce and go live with another, semmingly more fiscally responsible chap. And the main source of our irreconcilable differences resides on the street. See, I have this car... a nice bloke (Sargent Hughes is his name)... but he's about 2 or 3 times what I can actually afford. I catch a lot of flak from people about this. Maybe I deserve it, but I just joke it off.   So when people ask me if Mommy and Daddy hooked me up with the aforementioned cherry ride, I respond with, "No, it was an impulse buy... I went in for milk and came out with a TT and a Chunky." They quickly get a perplexed look in their eyes and laugh nervously.  But, the point of all this is the strange neural connection. Impulse buy and Chunky. So I got to thinking. Why don't people ever run to the store to buy a Chunky. Every once in a while you'll get an "I need a pack of Cinnaburst," or the occasional, "Can we stop for Kit-Kats," even those 1-1/2 calorie Tic-Tacs get representaion. So, why is it that the Chunky falls into the role of the red-headed step-child of the confection world. I mean, if you smell it does it not engulf you in a chocolatey euphoria? What do Milky Way and Snickers have that poor Chunky does not? Perhaps it's the name? Would more people go out of their way for a 'Svelty' or a 'Scrawny' bar? Maybe it's fear of that age old proverb "you are what you eat." In this age of perpetual dieting maybe there's no room for such sweet morsals. God Damn you, Dr. Atkins!  So next time you're in the express checkout lane behind some jackass who put both shitake and portabello mushrooms in the same produce bag in order to bypass that ever-so-strict '10 items or less' rule, look over at the Chunky but don't buy it. Instead, go home and write it on next week's grocery list in big block letters... I guarantee that you won't be disappointed. That square 2-by-2 package is cooler than the other side of the pillow. Just some food for thought... Or is it a marketing scheme? *cashes check for next car payment* PS... Does anyone even know what Chunky tastes like? I never had one of those MF bars. At least I know what my next pity purchase is.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Put down that Krackle and pick up a Crunch bar you Commie swine!  My previous foray into the politics of candy bars has led me to another of the industry's most heated debates. Krackle: Hershey's answer to Nestle's ever-so-successful Crunch bar, or Red propaganda aimed at American youth culture?  I heard at a party once that Krackle was the most popular candy bar in the Soviet Union when it made its debut in 1978. (Actually, I think I heard it from me, I was in the Mr. Knowsomestuff stage of intoxication, but since then, too many coincidences have augmented my concern) I don't mean to get all Joe McCarthy on your ass, but all I'm saying is 'if it looks like a duck... and talks like a duck... it must be a commie.'  Here's a little history lesson on the subject of the beautiful merger of milk chocolate an puffed rice. Nestle (the premeire confectionist of perhaps the most historically neutral country on the planet, Switzerland) introduced it's Crunch bar in 1938. Since then this texturial fusion of silky brown and bumpy white (sounds like a personal problem to me -e) has taken the bar candy industry by storm.   September 14th, 1978... Hershey shocks the nation with their new treat. The timing here is key. The subversive Reds would have observed a new generation. A guardless generation to which the 'Red Scare' of the 50s was nothing but a beddy-time story, and indulgences such as Disco and the Hula-Hoop were waning in popularity, making way for new guilty pleasures. The success of this bar was nothing remarkable to say the least, due to the late entry into the market. Krackle could not overcome the brand loyalty that 'Crunch-ers' (as they prefer to be called) have developed over decades. But did they care? No.  Since its inception, Krackle has cornered two niche markets that target American youth. The first of these is Holloween miniatures. What better way to distribute propagnda. The genius of this plan not only is exhibited by its success, but also in the lack of the public's understanding of their role in the spread of communism in North America. It's as if the Archbishop of New York was distributing fliers for 1/2 price beer night at a Chelsea gay bar, while filled with a sense of warmth that he brought happiness to the public. The second market that Krackle leads the way in is the coveted puffed-rice-and-chocolate-grammar-school-sales-contest market. Need I say more? Now, let's talk packaging... Upon first look, the red wrapper with white type may not seem too objectionable, but it provides for the strongest of all arguments on the subject. It's a little known fact that the original design for the wrapper had the word "Krackle" in yellow, but this was thought to be too obviously likened to the Soviet flag. The broken text of the word is in itself extremely anti-establishment. Coupling this fact with the blatent disregard for the arduous process of teaching youngsters to recognize the hard as well as the soft uses of the letter 'C,' rather acclimating them to the Cyrillic alphabet's lack of the aforementioned consonant's versatility, exhibits the coldness of their plan.  Even with all this convincing evidence, Hershey spokespersons continually refute these allegations and deny the existence of the scrapped "Workers of the world. Eat Krackle" advertising campaign. So, do with this information what you wish, but keep your eyes and ears pealed, for Halloween is just around the corner.

      ...Our Program already in Progress:  Hello friends. I guess this first of all posts should begin with a little about myself. That's easy, the name's Travis. I'm 21, on the brink of 22-dom. I currently reside in the DC area. I've been here for about a month and I think I'll keep it. I'm an engineer and I'm gay. I stand by my opinion that gay engineers make cool engineers, whereas straight engineers make dorks...  That's not meant as a dig to any of you. Making fun of others just makes you feel better about yourself. No seriously... There are some kickass not-completely-devoid-of-social-skills engineers out there. Of the 14 on the east coast... I'm friends with 12.   A little background, you ask? Okay... Born and bred in suburban Connecticut. Had your normal childhood. Shitty at times, lovely the next day. I just had that one thing that made me a little different than all my friends. That one thing that I couldn't talk about for most of my life. But then don't we all. I don't mean to depict my sexual orientation as a sob story by any means. We all have our trials and tribulations and are stronger/wiser for having experienced them. And don't get me wrong I had a loving supportive family, conservative and religious at the crux, but subsequently (and possibly hypocritically) supportive during my coming out.  I had two older siblings, the kind you love to hate, and hate to love, again typical. They are two of the most amazing people I know. I looked up to them so much in my life my neck is still sore. At times I couldn't stand them, at times they'd make me cry, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  And now on to my final family member, my secondary caretaker... TV. I have this long standing opinion that nearly everything I know I've learned from TV. If you yield the power of that beautiful glowing box for good, the world is your oyster. Well maybe not that much, but as Martha would say "It's a good thing." Early in my childhood I discovered (no not men, that came a little later), movies. Thank god I was born when I was, 'cause the VCR shaped my life. Look upon this as you wish, but I believe it was genuinely good  Whenever you talk to a gay person, well at least most of the time. They always say, "I always new I was different." Which is our way of saying even before I got erections from MTV's "The Grind," (Go Eric) I knew somethin' was up. So in order to escape those alienation feelings I entered what I have since dubbed 'my celluloid closet.' Was it healthy, maybe not, but it got me through a lot of years when I wasn't ready to face myself. People often wonder why they didn't know. To a certain extent so do I, but I sure as hell didn't want them to figure it out. Is this why there are so many homosexuals in Hollywood? Is it because we all grow up as actors? Well I played the part well. I didn't go as far as to submerse myself in athletics, but I have gotten to the point where I can't tell if things I like are mine, or my cover's. I'm like Charlie Baltimore in "The Long Kiss Goodnight," or am I Samantha Caine? Take music for one: Do I really like Metallica, or was that just my psyche trying to compensate my seemingly feminine 'condition' with more masculine characteristics? Well I am 1 year+ out of that closet, and this sort of self discovery is going to continue for a little while.   Maybe that's why I'm starting this... but I highly doubt it 'cause I predict that the majority of the posts will be of a random nature as an outlet for the funny that courses through my veins.

      So here's two for ya... and they continue to be bad.    Your blessing is no more than being safe and sound for the whole lifetime.    You are cautious in showing your true self to others.    So not only am I restricted from giving blood, but I am boring and fake as well.  What a catch... line up fellas, I start giving numbers at noon. I have to stop eating Chinese food.

      I had a lot of fun this weekend.  On saturday a coupla friends and I went to a DC101 (radio station in our nation's capitol) holloween party.  It was pretty cool, we didn't dress up or anything, but we all wore leather pants... I mean there's really no occasion otherwhen in the year to encase yourself in treated and dyed animal flesh, so you gotta take the opportunity when it arises.  Anywho, It was fun and I got trashed... naturally.  But I was Ferris Beulering everything.  I few hours into the party we were on the dance floor and some guy was carrying chicken to the VIP room.  I made and "ooh, ooh" noise and pointed... so he stopped came back and let me swipe a piece.  I don't know who that kind soul was, but I was never the same after that moment...    ...And then I thought things couldn't get better, I had just scored some comp-fowl and there was a disco band that was really kickin'.  I was wrong.  I go up to the band to try to request some Jackson five (a Jender and T-$$ staple when dancing), but struck out "No Motown he says... Try the DJ he says."  Well it was a big neg from the DJ too (actually I think he said yes, but I didn't hear it, 'cause... well you'll see why).  So I'm  on my way back to my friends when I see Giligan trying to get into the VIP room, and the bouncer stopped him.  Meanwhile I look all official coming from the DJ booth and everything, so I call out "No, that's Giligan let him in."  In the wake of my thrall the bouncer bends to my desire... then I just walk in.  Now I've already had 5 beers at this point and there was free shit in VIP, bad combo for the T-ster.  So I try to contact Jender via cellular technology, but nothin', thankfully they came in a little later when the bouncer stepped away for a pee break.  Meanwhile I'm sitting around with all these radio people, and I see Giligan and he's like "Dude, you got me in."  and I'm like "Go me!"      So I end up talking to Diane from the Elliot in the Morning Show for like and hour.  It must really suck to be them, 'cause they live hours of their lives in the public eye, and it must be taxing how everyone they talk to thinks they're like bestest frinds 'cause they ease the morning commute.  But back to me I down like 5 more beers, and Travis is kicked.  So I pile up a plate of wings and we head for the Metro.    Now this is where I forget everything.  I remember vaguely getting on the metro and making a fool of myself while I was on it.  I was told that I was telling everyone to get off "'cause Swank was too sexy." Thank god for Nordstroms 'cause I strapped the handles of a shopping bag on my ears like a feed bag and yakked all the way from Vienna back to Jender's.    All in all I had a blast, until sunday morning.  but all y'all know what that's like. Late...

      Well I eat too much Chinese food:  You make people realize that there exists other beautise in the world.    Which to me means "You're gonna die alone you ugly bitch, and drive all hot men into the arms of other hot men."  I think I should stop reading these things, 'cause Autumn pessimism is setting in.  'Cause I can make anything sound bad like if I get - "You're going to come into a large sum of money," I'll translate it to "You're gonna die alone you ugly bitch, and the only thing that will have sex with you will be cold hard cash."  Just kidding, I'm not really this bad... usually

      Hungover at coaster kingdom.    So I got trashed this past friday at my friend's.  It was monster night.  We watched old monster movies and carved pumpkins.  I forgot my pumpkin, but I'll get it tomorrow.  Anyway it doesn't matter it looked like Marv Albert.  Jender's was kick-ass though.  Solely because of the mouth.  which was my Idea. (just saving face 'cause even the cute dimple on mine couldn't salvage the gourd as a whole)    Anyway the next day She and I, and a new friend Swank went to Six Flags in MD.  It was a lot of fun, and a beautiful day.  But I wanted to hurl the whole time.  We were in line for the Batwing, right, and Swank was all "I don't wanna go on.. hear the people screaming?"  So Jender was like "They're just happy," and I was all "They're screaming for Charo."  It was really funny, at least to me in my diminshed brain cells state.  So after dropping a Jackson at random games around the park I won back to back roll-a-balls and acquired a stuffed Aligator named Charo (coincidence... there are two things I don't believe in... Coincidence and Gay Republicans).  Come to find out Charo is actually a transvestite and his real name is Ken Adams, how's that for twilight zoniness?      Well Incubus' new cd comes out tomorrow, so pick it up.    have a TT-rific day...

      I tend to order a lot of Chinese food, so I've decided to put up my favorite Fortune Cookie wisdoms whenever I encounter them.  My sister got this one last week, and I assure you this is verbatim, complete with exclaimation point:  Alas!  The onion you are eating is somebody else's water lilly.

      So birthday wishes to me.  It's 10 o'clock and I've already received calls.  I'm just hoping that nobody calls tonight during Buffy.    So I'm doing nothing today.  Just a quiet night.  Damn I really have to get on the ball with this apartment thing, but I just like having a little cash on hand ya know.  But then I need to make friends.  Damn I'm flippant today.      So I tend to start every paragraph with 'So.'  That's what I do when I have nothing of import to say.  You'll be happy to know that my gum wrapper chain has gotten longer, and I fortified every link with a little piece of gum so that it is stronger.  These are the things I tend to do when bored at work.    I hope that I can edit this later 'cause it's sooo dull.

      Forgive me friends for I have sinned... It's been so freaking long since my last confessional.  Just a little bit of my Catholic upringing reering it's ugly face.  It so weird how infused it is into my life, being that I'm like Mr. Religion-can-bite-me guy.    Anyway... I was having a personal problem last week... I couldn't find my deoderant.  I knew it was around somewhere 'cause it's not like you pick it up and walk around the house with it.  Ya know you use it and put it right back.  It's like misplacing milk... It just doesn't happen.  Well I was in my room yesterday and I saw my Life insurance policy on my table, and it hit me... Maybe it's under there.  Sure enough... Boy did I feel dumb... I was like "Salt and Pepper my face 'cause it makes the egg taste better."  But the funny thing is since I've received my Policy I've been more at ease that my loved ones will be taken care of if I... ya know... kick it. (and by loved ones I mean my car)  So deoderant was not as necessary.  I just marvel at the poetic nature of the snafu.  But now I'm fresh and smelling nicely...  So take comfort in that.    Later pease-blossoms

      Why can't the desire to fuck be transitive?    I was pondering this on the shitter...  oops crapper... today.  Since there is a mirror right there.  I was looking at my new highlights... and I quite like them now that I've showered.  I'm mean one of the benefits of being gay is that I'm my own demographic.  I was like:    If I came up to me and hit on me I would be receptive.  Therefore it goes to reason that I would hit on me.  (I think I achieved fourth person there)    So lets take a for instance... Mike Greybeal (grrrr...  he's this dude that was on undressed for a few episodes, a major beauty on the hot scale)...  So on a given day, lets say Tuesday, I'd have sex with him.  Now if we couple this with the above, 'I'd have sex with me,' then geometry would dictate that he would have sex with me.    But then I got to thinking; you throw in a girl who has bisexual tendencies who is attracted to me, then I'd have to want to have sex with her... and this just throws a wrench in the whole rigmoroll.  So I have tucked the "Transitive-Fuck" theory in a drawer with my other thwarted thoughts like: "I deserve to be wealthier than the crocodile hunter," and "with all the Grape-Nuts in the world why is there still hunger?"    Well bye now.    PS.  I had this weird dream last night, and I'm pissed that I can't remember the Haiku that was in it... 'cause it made me laugh... well as much as a sleeping person can laugh.

      I haven't put anything new up here in a while.  Soory.  I was watching TV last week, and I hit rock bottom.  FOX showed the ever-so-enthralling "Who Wants to be a Princess?" It sucked...  and I was stupider for having watched it.  Well, there was one good part.  When they were modeling and it showed their likes and dislikes... Everyone's dislikes were like: "Mean People," "Ignorant People," "Dishonesty," but this one girl's was "Moth Ball's and Hyper Dogs."  I wanted to jump in the screen give her a big smooch and hand her the crown.  I mean how real...  I laughed for like 10 minutes solid.  But then I saw the prince, and I was like "I'm glad she didn't win... what a troll.  I'd rather hop on Benjamin the results giver," or as his resume would say "Special Liaison to the Judges."  So that's it... I think my funny went on vacay...  Maybe it's the highlights.  DAMN YOU SALAZAR!!!

      I am sooooo tired today.    I mean add to the fact that I'm sick, I got like 5 hours of sleep.  Which for me is like none. I'm a sleep lover.  If sleep had the right equipment I'd sleep with it daily.  Well I guess bed thoughts kinda supplanted sex thoughts today though, maybe I am getting better.  eeeehhh... no... bad thoughts continue, but now they're all taking place in bed, whereas before they were everywhere... ya know locker rooms, prisons, atop the Seattle space needle, the usual.    The embassy was fun.  Jender and I just basically shot the shit all night, and made fun of (or more rarely complimented) all the attendees.  One woman was the undeniable reason that agoraphobia was created.  The beer lady was a trip though... she was funnnny with a capitol fun.  I liked her glasses.  Oh yeah and I got the play the didjeridu, which was an experience.    well I'm off to feign interest in my work as I contemplate my hopeful christmas gift of 600 thread count egyptian cotton sheets.  Betty so better be on the ball with that.  I mean have you ever heard of such a thing.  they are the bomb, and not just like the cherry bomb or the smart bomb, they are the H-bomb.  My sister already got hers, and I'm green with envy... or maybe that's nausea.    late...(can my goddamn nose just stop running!!!)

      E-gad!!!    It's been forever since I updated this chippy.  I'm sorry I'm quite delusional right now.  I'm sick, and kinda run down.  I'm just sitting here at work waiting for my tea to steep so I can down a coupla dayquil.  But the thing that sucks (for me... well if I don't stay home) is when I'm sick all I can think about is sex.  I'm not sure if any of you suffer the same byproduct of sickness, if you do, let me know so I don't feel like such a perv.  So it makes work that much harder, so to speak.  I sign out of yahoo mail and I see that eDiets guy and I'm gone... an hour later we're living in a townhouse with two puppies and a cockatoo (his, not mine, I tried to convince him that damn bird wasn't worth it, but he's one stubborn fag).  And so it goes... all day.  It's not so much of a one track mind, but more of a one station mind where all tracks meet.  AND to top it all off I didn't win Powerball last night... These are the things I have to deal with, I mean how much can one person take?  I'm like two seconds from writing the Lottery commission and saying "hey... If I don't start winning I'm gonna stop playing.  How do you like them apples?"  Look at me the little sicky weilding the iron fist.  I mean how else are you gonna get results?  A vague disclaimer is nobody's friend.    well off to whatever...  Austrailian Embassy tonight... I hope I fell better and don't puke on any diplomats.

      Who am I????    I hooked up with some kid last night.  I think it was all about making myself feel better.  I just returned to my alma mader and I'm all feeling old and shit.  But I hope to have a fun fun weekend, I just hope butter buns doesn't give me too much flak.  God I've never done that sorta thing while other people were in the room, visiting from outta town.  that's so skanky.  That's it I'm officially a skank.  I'm off to eat some really good chinese.

      I think I angered my Brother-in-law yesterday...    Ok, my bad totally, my room is getting a bit messy.  Well, up until last night, when I cleaned... majorly.    So my sister called this morning and was like "Thanks, it looks great."  and I'm like "huh?" great, I just cleaned my room.  It's not like I made a chess set carved out of white potatos and sweet potatos that have been fried, so that as you win you can eat french-fried bishops and rooks and pawns.    It's not like I did that... I just cleaned my room.

      I drank like two pots of coffee this morning.  Consequently I thought I was going to puke so I went home after lunch.  Ironically I felt better once I got home, what a kick.    So I popped over to Pier 1 'cause there was this blanket I wanted to get, and over to Suncoast to get a cheesy homo pic.  I never thought a movie could be this bad, but enjoyable.  I mean once you get throught the horrible story, vomit inducing acting, choppy editing, and sickening soundtrack... it bit, but the lead was HOT, so all is forgiven.  I'm such a sucker for a pretty boy.    Well off to nap my half day away.

      I'm bored at work.  I don't know why offices that don't have constant turnover (like stores, or factories) have to be open.  I think I'm totally not comming in tomorrow.  There's like nobody here.    So I made some changes to my template.  I like it better, I robbed some code from e, 'cause I've become HTML ignant.  But I can't find this freaking roll of film that I want to use as pictures.  I'm pissed.  But whatev.  I guess I'll just have to take some more.    God I have no funny stories.  I'm dull today.  My sister was telling me that yesterday she was riding the elevator with one of the partners of her firm.  This guy's like 50 and a partner in one of DC's largest law firms.  He was talking to her about the weather, and she was saying how it would probably not snow.  So he was like:    Partner: "Do you ski?" Sister: "I used to, but now I just really like sledding."    As if it wasn't enough that my sister's barely knee high to a puppy and looks about 12, now her favorite pastimes include sledding.  Last night she was kicking herself.

      This is a dream I had last week:    It was a nice day at the races.  Dog? no, Horse? no, groundhog? yes.  So it was the finals of the national groundhog races and the favorite, ButterBuns, was up against the underdog, Nicky.  I wanted Nicky to win 'cause I had a nickel on him.    There was a little confusion 'cause Nicky wasn't high in the polling system, but he had won all his matches, so a challenge was extended on ButterBuns' behalf, but the Judges ruled in favor of Nicky.  BB was dressed in a Bumble bee outfit complete with fuzzy antenae.  An obvious crowd favorite to Nicky's black jersey.    And they're off!!!  ButterBuns took an early lead at 50m, but Nickey pulled it out in the last leg.  So I took my 5 g's to the victory party and got completely smashed.  It was a good day.  Even Punxatawney Phil came out, but stardom has really gotten to him, and he's been hitting the H a little too hard.  So he just sits around and waits for February when the spotlight is on him.  That prognasticating fuck, he's nothing more than a glorified coin toss.    Calc-u-lator

      Well I'm back at work.  Fuck all you who aren't.  I hope everyone had a nice holiday weekend.  I did.    Holiday traditions are weird.  I don't know why.  Okay I come from a Catholic family, but I'm an Atheist, so I constantly have a battle of what i should do.  What is the least disrepectful to my family, and what is the least disrespectful to their religion.  I simply choose to abstain from most of it.  I go to Christmas eve mass, but I don't participate.  I basically just sit there and look around, usually checking out boys, but then I check myself 'cause that's not the place.  But then there's grace, and all the family talking about how nice the service was.  And I'm like "ehh."  It's painful.    But then we go to my cousins to eat.  This is my dad's side of the family, very Slovak.  It's fun, but "Holy Supper" as it is called, is very shiny.  I don't know if you know about Slovakian food, but it's all cabbage, potato, and lots and lots of butter.  Every year we sit down to a meal of saurkraut soup, boiled potatos, perogies, cabbage and noodles, kielbasa and kraut, etc.  Lard basically.  But I love it.  Then Christmas day is when we get turkey and other American things.    I scored some pretty good gifts this year.  Got the Sapranos 1 & 2, sheets (only 440, but ehh, I can't stay mad at my mom), Dr. Zhivago, Rogue Leader, two pairs of shoes, a Gamecube case, and some other stuff.  Damn I'm spoiled.  I'm like 22 and I still get lots of gifts.    I talked to my Grandfather this weekend on the phone for like 20 minutes.  It was strange, I've never talked to him for more than 5 minutes, and even then it would be about computers.  But this time it was about everything.  Apparently he has a girlfriend.  Well that just pulls my cork (I don't know what it means, but my Nanny said it this weekend, she so funny, she's 85 and quite a firecracker), I can't believe my 78 year old grandfather can get a girlfriend, and I am boyless.  But anyway, he asked me if I had a girlfriend, and I'm like "ehhh, no."  It's not like I think that he wouldn't approve or anything, I just don't feel it's necessary to tell all the old people until ya know I'm in a relationship that last longer than a week... erm... end.  I was psyched though, I got off the phone with him and I turn to my brother and I'm like "I'm his favorite."    My brother was really funny this weekend though, we got drunk yesterday and apparently he wants to be on Saturday Night Live.  I'm not sure if he's up for it, but I think we come from some pretty funny stock.  We talked until like 3 in the morning.  It was fun.  I get to meet his girlfriend when I'm in NYC for New Years.  I'm psyched.    Then before I hopped in my car to return to the Nation's Cap we went over to my mom's side, very Italian.  But the ass grabbin' didn't last that long I had to get on the road.    God I'm boring today.  Recounting my holiday isn't much fun for y'ins.    In the words of my baby cousin: "I don't wike tickows"

      This is not so much of a now epiphany, but a remmberance of epiphanies past:    When I was like 4 or something my parents, like many warm, giving Americans got sucked in my Sally Struthers and Save the Children.  So we sponsored this little girl, her name was Pinky.  (Which coincidentally became the name of my first goldfish, making my porn name Pinky Washington.  With a name like that I'd have to do porn as a tranni)  So for the longest time, which was probably like a few months I thought that Pinky was actually my sister, and I couldn't figure out why she didn't live with us.  I was such a 'ron of a tyke.    Also for a while I thought that the term 'rents' (as in "I'm living with the rents") was in reference to the fact that you should be paying rent, not a shortened version of parents.  For a smart guy I'm so dumb.    Fish and Chips and Chips and Fish Fish and Chips and Chips and Fish Fish and Chips and Chips and Fish Oh what a delicious dish!    (I hate fish and chips, but that just poped into my head, for no reason.  I'm drinking coffee for peeper's sake)

      So I had sushi for lunch today and I was thinking.  I gotta find a new thing to eat, 'cause sushi (although quite satisfying without the clogged pore/enlarging thighs feeling of a BigMac) is so last year.  It's somewhere between '5 minutes ago' and 'out' on the Shaw Report.  I mean as far as food fads go it's pretty good, but when are we gonna have another bad-for-you food fad.  Why can't  Ben and Jerry's  come back into style?..  Well without all the hemp accessories and plaid.    In addition, I believe I may have ended my boycott of artificial sweeteners.  I'm drinking a Diet Coke (oops, I corrected it, but that 'coke' was originally a bad word... or rather a great word).  Finally I feel like I am actually comming into my own as a gay man.  I mean who among the human race enjoys men, and drinks exclusively straight up soda.  I mean only heteros like sugar in the can.  We prefer (a)sper(ta)m(e).    Anyway, I'm just a big goof today.

      Well I hope everybody is having a good Happy Stacey Day.  It's a day we invented 'cause my sister finished her last final (3rd year law school) last night.  Her name is Traci, but I call her Stacey sometimes...  'cause I have a bad memory.    I had my first Krispy Kreme doughnut today.  I can't believe I've been a KK virgin for 22 years.  It was awesome.  There's about a dozen more in the break room, but I don't want anymore, I think I'd be ruined for life, not to mention this afternoon.  Last night I forgot to eat, so I'm betting some time around 11 It'll be go time, and the more greasy the food is I eat the less pleasant the experience will be.    Tomorrow I head back to CT, the land of commuters and bad beaches.  But hell I love it.  I can't wait to see all my friends.  Then it's back here on tuesday, and back to manhattan on friday only to come back here the following tuesday.  I'm just a ping pong ball and the Delaware Memorial Bridge is my net.    Well a Happy Happy Stacey Day to you all.    Perco-lator

      Okay so I got to thinking you all know about my thoughts and my life, but what about my subconscious?  So I decided to start this new segment call... (cue dramatic music)    NAME THAT CHILDHOOD TRAUMA!!!    It's about dreams, and if you have theories on what my dreams are about let me know.    Okay so last night I had this dream that I was at a Naval Academy graduation, not as a graduate but as a spectator.  So I come up into the stands but I'm on the wrong side.  (sidebar: I also had an ability to jump really high)  So I whip out 2 umbrellas, one of which is inside out and pointed down, and I jump really high and drift slowly towards the other side of the bleachers.  It took about 4 jumps and every time I landed on a soon-to-be alumn I realize that they're all people I knew from high school.  So I finally get to where my family is and the Admiral who is giving the key note speech said "GOOD JOB!!!"  Then the whole stadium erupted in applause.    I have no idea either...

      I have no idea what is up with people today.  Elliott in the Morning (DC101's morning show) was a veritable conucopia of nut jobs.  For 30 minutes they talked to a 60+ year old Barber in Rockville, MD who likes to wear a bra and fake 44 D's while he cuts people's hair.  So this fella, Luis, dressed up and became Luise, I felt bad after a while 'cause they were going a little far, but it was funny.  But they were also pressing him about being gay even though he said he wasn't.  I mean there is a difference between cross-dressing and homosexuality.  I thought that we all figured this out with J. Edgar.    And then afterwards some people in traffic called in and said that two girls with a camera were hanging out on the side of the road with a sign saying "Show us your twins."  People are so nutty some times.  I don't know if people actually obeyed their wishes, but I'm sure it was a site to see.  I wish that would happen when I'm in traffic, 'cause I get so damn bored.    Anyway, I think I'm now in love with Nick Hexum from 311(drool).  I'm gonna go fantasize now.    Oh yeah, and if anyone has a life that they can spare I'll give ya 50 bucks for it.

      So for lunch today a coworker and I went to the mall 'cause he had to get a present for his little cousin.  While there and walking down the aisle I hear a punk kid (when did I turn 65?) say "Hey there goes the faggots."  I look around to see who he was referring to, come to find out he was talking about some uniformed military personnel.  I was a little peeved, I mean c'mon.  Especially with all the crap going on, show some respect.  Not to mention his use of the f word, I mean when my friends say it to me it's kinda funny, 'cause I know that they love me, but saying it in public.  Okay that's enough moral outrage, that's not really what this site is supposed to be about.    Well anyway I bought the new 311 CD, 'cause I like 2 songs.  I have got to stop doing this.  I mean, I just got the System of a Down CD too, and I only knew 1 song.  But whatever, I think the 311 dude has a really sexy voice, so I'll probably enjoy the rest of it.    I think I mainly pick my music 'cause I like the guy's voice.  I mean I rarely listen to female vocalists, sometimes, but not nearly as much as the fellas.  Is that wrong?  I ask you.  I mean it doesn't have to be rip your clothes off sexy, even just cute sexy.  Here's my CD changer line up right now:    1: Mix with Dave Matthews, Disturbed, etc (soon to be 311) 2: Pete Yorn 3: Gorillaz 4: Incubus 5: Linkin Park 5: System of a Down    I mean and look at my past favs:    Metallica Travis Coldplay REM Ben Folds Alice in Chains Soundgarden Tool The Beatles Limp Bizkit Michael Jackson Supergrass Billy Joel Finger 11 ...    Not a hoo-ha in the bunch.  Do I have a problem?  Maybe, but whatever... Shut up.

      So Atlantic city this weekend was a lot of fun.  Although I did only spend (or waste) what I had allotted I still come away more affluently challenged than last week.  But I think it was worth it.  On the trip up Jender was a worthy companion:    (While driving through Baltimore) Jender: Look at the cruise ship! Me: Uhhh, honey... That's the Coast Guard    With conversations like that the trip was quite entertaining.  It was a little chilly though walking from the hotel to and from Ceasar's, my balls were brick-ass frozen.  And along the Miss America walk of (f/sh)ame watching Jender do the 'elbow-elbow-wrist-wrist-wrist' wave was a hoot.    But back at the Sheraton bar we had a blast.  Broke and busted we whipped out the plastic and charged up a tab.  The two bartenders were hot (one with and one without a peeper) and a lot of fun.  And the live entertainment was at a perfect volume, loud enough for you to be able to sing without bothering anyone, but quiet enough for you to converse.  Throughout the night Jender was requesting (aka screaming) "Mr. Big, Mr. Big!!!"  But it never came, but there was some good Journey, Billy Joel, etc.  I was all "ugn scht, ugn ahh," during Allentown.  14 drinks and a hot-as-hell order of chicken fingers later we ended the night.    The drive back was eventful.  I caught holy hell when, BOTH of us I might add, missed the exit for the turnpike, so we ended up in Philly.    J: Should we turn around T: Um I think we can pick up 95 in Philly J: YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE T: Hey we both missed the exit and we both drove here, but I know 95 goes to Philly so I'm pretty sure we can pick it up J: PRETTY SURE, WE'RE LOST YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE T: YES I DO, THERE'S PHILLY, if we don't hit 95, we can turn around J: JUST 'CAUSE WE CAN SEE PHILLY DOESN'T MEAN YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE T: CALM DOWN J: DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN, WE'RE LOST (Lo and Behold we come up on 95) T: See we're okay. J: (laughing) We fight like a married couple.    So we made it home actually faster than if we didn't go through PA, 'cause we didn't hit any stop lights.  All in all, a successful road trip.

      Dear readers I brought my car in for service today.  I think the guy was a little peeved that it's like 7k past due.  He got the "mommy/daddy bought that for you ya brat and you can't take care of it" look on his face.  Meanwhile I'm scrimping and saving to make the payments (shuttup).  And I'm like "Um...and...um...I got a dent...and if you get a chance could you check it out...um..."  I'm so not forcefull.  I have no power.  I can't remember the last time I had any power.  And I'm not talking sexual power, or conversational power, 'cause I've had that, I'm talking social status power.  Oooh, ooh, I remember:    Picture it, Connecticut 1989.  My brother's team just won the Little League World Series in Williamsport, PA and I'm feeling a little unattended, if you will.  So as I enter the fifth grade I obtain the most coveted position an elementary school student could have:  Bus Patrol.  [CUE EERIE MUSIC]  Not only did I get the fashonably blinding orange belt/Miss america sash, but I got a badge.  Okay I don't know about your neck of the woods but in our precinct the badges worked like this:    No Trim: Patrol  Red trim: Sergeant (Walkers) Green trim: Lieutenant (1 per bus) Blue trim: Captain (2 per school)    So me and one of my friends (who was my grade nemesis to my parents, but I could give too shits about grades, I haven't come too far) were the Captains.  Captain Horton and I ran the monthly meetings.  In addition I had carte blanche for 20 minutes a day 'cause I was the first bus stop in the morning and the last in the afternoon.  And at any time I could boss people around or even...  SIT IN THE BACK!!!  It was like the holy grail to single digit peeps.  I loved it in the rear (I definitly haven't come too far).  But as a fair an impartial emperor, I joke I mean captain, I joke I mean RULER! I invoked the Magna Carta of Bus #13 agreements (okay Lietunant Cohen helped draft it, I couldn't spell well, damn I'm like the same person as I was 12 years ago, just with better fashion sense, and without the two inch lenses warping my NOSE FOREVER... I'm bitter).  This agreement was an organized schedule that placed the 6 patrols in pairs (A, B, and C) on a weekly rotating schedule for sitting in the front, middle and REAR.  This way if any of the yungsters had problems a patrol would be within 4 seats and also a patrol would always be in the emergency exit row.    So as my brother was getting free trips to Yankee Stadium, Shea and Fenway I was taking my anger out on 4th graders.  Especially that kid, something Weiner, he was such a cock.    Oh to weild that sort of power again...

      Okay I'm starting a new recurring entry type today.  It's called Epiphany.  It's for when I discover that I've been stupid for years thinking one thing when it's completely false.    Here's a warmer: I Never knew that there was no such word as "reoccurring".  I tried using it in my earlier entry and checked my spelling and lo and behold, not there.  I'm sure e is like "Finally, that fucking moron makes my ears bleed every time he says it."  Yeah I know how you are.    And here's the real one: Okay, just a few days ago I realized that on the Monopoly board those are not ghosts in the Community Chest, they're bags of money.  I always thought they were demented little ghosts with their beedy little eyes.  Now it makes sense, I've always preferred Chance, and every time I'd pick up a CC card I'd be filled with a strange fear. check it out a see if you can see how my fucked up brain Rorschached  this .

      I think I have a tapeworm... again!  I'm freaking hungry from the word go.  So I have moved into my antiparasitic mode.  Smoke, starve, etc.  anything to get rid of it.  (I'm actually kidding here I don't actually think it's true)  So water only for my uninvited cohibitant.    Last night I had a dream that I was at a concert and my baby got hit.  Sgt. Hughes was all banged up, I was quite distraught.  I never actually got to see the Moody Blues.  That's a recurring dream for me.  Going to a concert and not making it out of the parking lot for one reason or another, but it's usually 'cause of drinking, drugs (which I don't even use), or other debauched activities.  I wonder why.  At least it's not teeth falling out, I hear that's about anxiety, and it only makes me more anxious.    So I bought Pikmin for GameCube yesterday.  It's actually a lot of fun, but kinda involved.  Those little guys are kinda cute, and the little space man is awww-dorable.  We'll see how it pans out.    I hope AC goes well.  I think I'm gonna buy a powerball ticket too.  I read that it was my golden month, so I'm hoping I can score big.  Actually e read it to me.  It was in some summer issue in Jane.  But it did say I'd get a job in August (which I did), and get some lovin' in October (well my skank activity was in November, but I'm a late Libra), so maybe.  Or maybe it means that I'm finally gonna buy ABBA Gold (that's what Jender and I are gonna listen to on the way to Sodom... I mean Atlantic City).  Well either way I'm happy.    Tonight is the finale of The Amazing Race, and it has been a trip, let me tell you.  It seems like such a cool show to be on, even if you lose you at least get to go to some cool places and do some cool shit.  I don't know who I want to win though.  Team Guido is way back (thank god, they give homos a bad name).  So it's between Rob and Brennan (the hot lawyers), and Frank and Margarita (the separated couple),  I think my vote is for F&M 'cause it looks like they may be able to patch things up and there's a kid involed in that relationship.  I just hope those crazy kids can work it out.  Well it would help if Frank would stop being abusive, which, to his merit, he seems to have turned it around lately.  But now that Kevin and Drew are outta it I don't care too much, those guys were a laugh riot.    I'm hungry, or rather my flatworm cohort is, but I think I'm gonna stall him until 1.  Sorry for the randomness of this entry.

      So did you watch 24 last night?  WOW.  That show rocks.  This is what my life has been boiled down to.  Doesn't it suck.  No really, I'm just kidding.  I think I'm just getting my interholiday bumms.  It happens every year.    Well I'm really looking forward to AC this weekend (that's Atlantic City to the laymen [mmmm...lay-men, yes sir.  Sorry]).  I'm planning on winning about 50-grand...  I mean give or take.    Ooh, ooh, I was thinking this the other day, I'm always so positive when gambling.  I'm all like I'm gonna win powerball, I'm gonna rock at roulette, Ed McMahon already has my number, that eDiets guy shops at my grocery store and we're gonna get it on.  Ya know stuff like that.  And then I get stuck with people comming up to me after asking how it turned out, well low and behold I'm empty handed.  So not only were my dreams dashed but fuckin' people rub it in.  One of these days I'm tellin' ya, I'm gonna win and nobody's gonna believe me.  I know what you're thinking: "loser."  Well how 'bout I pop off one of your antennas and throw it across the yard.  Then who's the loser, you or me?    But anyway I'm hoping I'm gonna be able to stick to my "I have this much to play with and I can't lose any more."  'cause I think I'm highly susceptible to the fever.

      So I was peeing in the urinal yesterday when it hit me.  I prefer street shopping in the winter.    Why you ask?  Well here's my reason.  In the winter when you street shop the natural light is dim, making for highly reflective glare free store windows.  And we all know about the expansive and contractatory (I made up that word right?) properties of glass.  So when the inside tempurature is warmer than the outside temperature it makes the inner plane of the window slightly larger than the outer plane, thus creating a slightly concave surface.  This makes you look thin and beautiful.  Generally panes of glass are taller than they are wide, if you are walking past a store where the pane is wider than it is tall, look away, it will only make you look short.  Conversely in the summer you look fat.  This is a variation on the hall of mirrors attraction at amusement parks.  Be forwarned that this is not always the case as some new windows are installed more snug than others to allow for settling and foundation frost heaving.    I know what you're thinking, "Damn that was a long pee."  Well your right, I think I drink too much coffee in the morning.    So then I shook it twice ('cause any more and I'd be playing with it), and went back to my desk.

      So I think I'm getting stupid...  and it sucks.    Some time last week I was on the phone in the back yard smoking, when I finished my cigarette I proceeded to come inside.  The sliding door was open so I just walked in...walked in is right...right into the screen door.  My brother-in-law still busts on me for that.    A few days later I take another way home right, to avoid traffic.  So I'm driving down the street (in the opposite direction from what I usually do) and I notice that there are a lot of cars parked.  So I pick a spot between two unfamiliar cars thinking maybe someone's having a party.  Parallel park effortlessly, it was great.  Then I get out and approach the door, finally it dawns on me.  "Where's the huge mound and trees?"  I was about a block short of my house, so I stood there for a few minutes trying to decide weather to move the car or just walk, finally I decide to move it.  So I walk up to the door, put the key in, and guess what... it doesn't turn.  I got all embarrassed and pissed, then I realized that I just didn't put it in far enough, so I went inside defeated.    On a completely different topic I was watching Trading Spaces with my sister this weekend and Vern was painting a room red, the walls and the ceiling, and my sister and I got to talking:    Traci: Vern likes Red. Me: Vern really likes Red. Traci: Red is Vern's favorite color. Me: Vern loves Red. Traci: Vern really loves Red. Me: Vern's gonna marry Red.    I really think some good points were brought up in that conversation so I thought I'd share.

      Okay it's been a while since I've put some of these up, but I was waiting for some good ones.    Well first off when I was in Pitt like ages ago (if you recall this was the skank day) I went out to eat with a coupla friends.  And strangly enough we all got the same fortune:    Prejudice is the child of ignorance.    At least it wasn't bad, and kinda informative.  Also the Pitt delt me this one:    What makes an Apple fall to the ground?    Well I'm no physisist, but this doesn't strike me as the brain buster it's portrayed as.  Finally this weekend I got what experts believe is the best fortune ever:    You are almost there.    Shortly after reading this I DID in fact arrive at a destination.  WOW, isn't that creapy!!!

      So I was going to write today about how I'm getting stupid, but that's gonna have to wait 'cause I am a GENIUS.    I'm sitting in work trying to figure out something to do and I get some coffee.  It tastes really bitter and strong.  So I'm like "I wish someone could combine the manly bean flavor of coffee with the smooth leaf flavor of tea."  Well someone can.  So I steeped tea in already strong coffee.  The bitterness was removed.  I can't decide whether to call it Coffeete or Teaffee.    I'm telling ya this thing is like the closest thing you can get to opium (yeah whatever like I'd know).  I'm so high on caffiene right now.  SHUT UP LITTLE LEPRECHAUN MAN I'M TRYING TO TYPE!    Anywho, I emplore you all to give it a whirl, but only if you don't have to drive for at least 6 hours.  I think it's gonna be the trademark drink at 'The Daily Grind'.    Oh shit...gotta run...comming down...    UPDATE:    Okay nevermind.  DON'T TRY THIS.  There is no way I'd get FDA approval.  I almost puked a little while ago, and my heart is beating at an unprecedented rate.  I need a valium.  These DTs suck.  I'm through with Teafee, I'm glad I got that monkey off my back... On an unrelated note I'm looking forward to a weekend of drinking and debauchery.

      Okay so I was walking in Georgetown this past weekend and I was thinking.  I should open a coffee house... I'd call it "The Daily Grind."  Get it?  I think it's cute in a quarky way.  Once I get that inexhaustible source of income I'm set.  Then you all can take a break from your daily grind and stop in for some coffee.  I wouldn't be there though 'cause I'd have so much money I wouldn't be friends with the likes of you anymore.    Well, here's to wishing I'll never see your ugly mug anymore!!    Just kiddind... Ta-ta

      Someone remind me never to drink tea in the afternoon.  Especially when it's useasonably warm outside.  God it's like I'm having hot flashes...  Oh shit... maybe it's menopause.  Great like I need to have another reason I'm not going to have kids.  Like keeping my cell phone in my pocket near my buddies and smoking aren't enough reason.  Not to mention the fact that all ovum are banned from sexual encounters involving me.    Well back to my desk.  It's cooler in that corner of the room anyway.

      So I really need to do something about how this looks huh?  Well I'm lazy.  So screw you!  But anyway, I haven't put anything up here in like a week.  I can't think of anytrhing funny to write about.    Well yesterday bit...(commence bitch) I had a swift 2 hour commute in the morning - BLAHHHH!!  Some 18 wheeler bottomed out...  It was like someone took the two ends of it and snapped it, like a popoid (remember popoids, I used to make popoid cars and pilot them with my weebles).  So that was a pain in my tushie.  Then my evening drive to Tysons to meet Jender for a lovely dinner (Thai) was trafficky too.  And there was an accident on the way home from the mall.  I completed the beltway in one day yesterday and it only took 4 hours in the car ARGHH!  But I think it was worth it, 'cause when we were in the Gap I was like "I like those jeans," and Jender was like "I like that Mannequin's ass," I about lost it.    Well I think that's it.  Later.

      So I'm thinking (this just means passing thought, not definite) of getting a nose job.  I snore okay.  I would like to fix that... well that and I hate my nose like huge-time.  I surfed for a bit to see how much it'd set me back, and they only run like 3 grand.  Maybe next year.  I just don't know how to explain the time off, or the different nose to people at work.  Am I incredibly vain?  Well of course.  Aren't we all. What do you think?  I mean I don't really think it'd be a waste of money, say I'm gonna live for like at least 40 more years, that's just pennies a day. (wait lets calculate: 3000/(40*365.25) = $0.21) It's totally fiscally responsible.

      Pull up a chair and mainline the ginko it's time for last night's dream:    I'm at home with my sis and her husband about to watch a movie, so we dim the lights.  All of a sudden the wind seems to pick up and a tree flys by the window.  I'm like "Look that tree has many trunks." And then the wind began to switch the house to pitch and suddenly the hinges started to unhitch just then the witch, to satisfy an itch went flying on her broomstick thumbing for a hitch.  So we high tailed it outta there and headed for the beach, which as we all know is the only safe place during times of hurricane.  I dimly recall how I saw in a movie that if there's a hurricane and you're on the beach head south since hurricane's travel north.  But since we were on the west coast it was reversed.  To get a better view of the situation my mother (um, hi mom, when did you get here) suggested that we ride the ferris wheel.  From that vantage point we could see what remained of our house and the fact that the winds had died down.  So we two step it back to the neighborhood hoping there's something left...    On the way we run into my sister's friend, she and her husband were okay, but it seemed that the 'cane had swallowed up their dog Josh (which is sad 'cause I love Josh, he's like the only dog I've really liked.  I told Jender that I liked dogs with people names and she's like "what like Margerie," and I'm like "I said dogs not bridge partners.").  So I'm totally bumbed out by this Josh is gone thing, so I go out with some high school friends...    We running-man up to the top of a really tall building.  I'm like "Hey my house got blown up by that 'cane."  And they're like "really."  I was pissed that they didn't care more.  Then my friend Steph is like "look at this ad I saw in the Catholic Journal."  And it's a guy with his hand on a balcony pulling himself up.  It's like a anti-suicide ad, and the caption said "When you're holdin' Your golden."  It was like even when you've jumped it's not too late to grab onto anything.  It went on to say that it's okay, all you need is a good grasp, because then the hair products you use will get cought by the wind and carry the  majority  of your weight to saftey.  Unfortunately our hair product booted us over the edge.  As we fell we grabbed onto the 1st floor balcony and were saved.  I was still upset from the apathy of my friends so I was like "I'm going for ice cream"...    I get the the ice cream counter and the cute attendant slips my a dark chocolate scoop for free.  Then this girl Amber sits next to me and I proceed to hit on her and successfully pick her up, which is funny 'cause I don't like chocolate ice cream.  She didn't get what she wanted either so she complained.  Wackyness ensued and we get chased outta there by this b(i/u)tch woman.  We end up switching ice creams, it was sickenly sweet a spectacle.  How hetero...    We go to see a movie and back to her place for some drinks, meanwhile I'm like "what time is it." She's like "6 why?" I"m like "I was supposed to catch some gay porn on VH1 at 11, but I guess I missed it."  After a few drinks she start kickin' it into high gear, and I'm feeling all experimental and I'm like as long as my pants stay on I'm not straight.  (I don't get the reasoning either)  So I was all about pleasing her and did some things I will not go into, not because they're graphic, but because I don't want to remember that. ever.  Regaurdless I was all about pleasing her, which is weird 'cause I'm selfish in bed (hehe).  So she was happy...    The next day I go to work as a waiter in this upscale bar.  As I'm waiting the tables I see Amber and she calls me over to where her friends are.  It turns out that she's kinda a professional woman.  Not like a ho, but rather a girl who hangs out with hot guys who have money so they don't have to buy anything.  She turns to her friend, Shoe, another golddigger (what the hell kinda name is that), and is like "This guy knows how to treat a woman," Shoe: "He's that good." Amber: "Def."  So Amber goes to town on Shoe while Shoe is licking my eyelid, which I don't know if it feels this good in real life ("lick my eyelid" is not really in my pillow-talk repertoire) but I was likin' it big time...    I bolted up from unconsciousness with pink eye and thinking "am I a lesbian?"

      I spent so much money yesterday, and more to come this weekend.  I bought a new down comforter, pillow, and mattress.  I can't wait to hook it all up, with my 440 ct sheets, I'm never gonna wanna get outta bed.  WOOHOO!!  I'm gonna get the mattress delive-d on tuesday.  Hopefull by then I'll already have the bed frame and desk I want.  I'm so 'cited.    Do you ever listen to music and it brings you back to a time forgotten?  Recently XTC's  Dear God  has been taking me back to last spring.  I guess it's in part due to the fact that it's fucking hot out in the District.  But it just reminds me of when I was moving out of Pittsburgh and I was cooking everything in my freezer.  I'd make like 5 meals a day.  I think one day I made burgers, perogies, two kinds of rice, two kinds of pasta, and pork chops.  That was fun.  I was like pouring olive oil on everything.  I guess that's the guinea in me (is that how you spell that?  or is that like a country?  I'm not sure, where do you even look up the spelling of racial epithets?).   Offensive Slang  . Used as a disparaging term for a person of Italian birth or descent.  IT IS!  Go me... get funky... it's my birthday!

      Guess what I saw on the way to work today (a perk of living in the Nation's Capital)?  Now don't quote me on this 'cause I have other theories too, but I saw what I think was a Harrier Jet.  I was driving along and I'm like "that jet is moving really slow."  A little later I notice that it prety much wasn't moving at all.  I mean I could be wrong, 'cause I was in traffic and delusional.  It was either that or a jet shaped baloon, or maybe a jet on a stick.  But then again it was green wheras in  True Lies  it was grey.  Do you think the Harrier Jet comes in more than one color?  I'd like to get one in sky blue, 'cause I'd be virtually invisible to people on the ground.  Oh the possibilities...

      So I checked the MTV fantasy thing, and unfortunately e kicked my ass! (something like 268 to 170)  BITCH!  Just kidding, I won't know the break down until tonight, I could only check out the total score.  "Paging Mr. Bigfatstupidloser?, Mr. Bigfatstupidloser your mother wants you home by 9."    Other than that I have nothing to say today.  Ehh.  Fuck it.  I'm having a blah blah day.  But tonight is new  Buffy , so happy Trav.    I love you all, but d'ya know what I love more?  No, not anonymous sex.  Nicotine.  Off to smoke.  Late    PS.  I think someone got here by searching for 'thalky' on google, I hope they weren't looking for my bro or sis.  I should've picked something less confusing.  I'm stupid.  But in college people would call me 'Alky Thalky,' 'cause I'd drink like a horse, and it just kinda stuck (well in my head at least, nobody really calls me that anymore)

      So my new, or revisited, obsession right now is the Real World.  and with MTV doing the fantasy challenge for the battle of the seasons I'm giddy (and more than a bit pathetic).  I encourage all of you to sign up and make a team, then let me know what your name is so we can compete, ya know... like losers.  I already made e do it.  But today is the last day.    GO HERE   if you wanna have fun too. Or just waste some time.    I think I want to apply again (want to again, not apply again).  I've always just put it off.  But I think it'd be fun.  I'm such a waste of space sometimes.  I just want adventure.  Maybe I should just get lost in Jersey again.    Whatever, happy monday, and good luck with your teams (I know none of you will actually do it, and I say fuck you... I'll be having fun, and what will you be doing?  HUH?  Yeah that's right, nothing.)    PS 4 days until moving (well maybe 5, but 4 sounds better)

      Happy friday to all.    I think I'm gonna check out today at 3 'cause it's happy weekend, and the earlier I leave the less traffic I hit.  I'm in a good mood, but I just got to work, so I wonder how long that will last.    My sister was so moody and funny last night.  We were sitting and she was whining about chocolate, so she wanted me to get her a cookie dough Slim Fast bar (Okay, is the concept lost on me, or are those things supposed to be for lunch, not a post dinner snack), so I kept going to the kitchen and firing back the wrong ones.  Apparently we have like 4 types of bars in the house.  But she couldn't catch (maybe it's genetic, oh wait my brother can catch, and she's a girl and I'm a fag), so it hit her in the eye.  For the rest of the night she's like "Am I swollen," so I got her mind off it by saying, "No, but one of your eyebrows is like an inch lower than the other.  You need to wax."  I know it's not the nicest thing to say, but she was annoying.  Then a game of cards solved it all.

      I got really angry at my hair last night 'cause it's kinda long.  That bitch didn't cut it short enough.  Seriously I was like an inch from being sent to that island ( see last entry ).  So I whipped out the scissors and started cutting.  Don't get me wrong I wasn't like sculpting, I mean I'm no Edward Scissorhands.  I just thinned out the burns and cut a little off the back so it wouldn't curl under, it usually buys me a week and a half.  But now I have a bald line through my right sideburn.  I'm all sheepish.  But if anyone brings it up I have the perfect homo cover:      Person : What happened to your hair.  Me:      I know.  See I was trying to save some money for this new Kenneth Cole jacket so I went to Supercuts.  Big mistake.  I will never do that again.  There gonna hear from my lawyer in 2 to 4 days.  I should have known.  From now on only Dominique touches my hair.  She's a miracal worker with my roots.  I'm sorry I have to jam.  I'm off to Saks to pick up a new hat to cover this mop.     Whatta ya think?  Do you buy it?

      Boo!    Did I scare ya?  I'm cold right now.  I always get cold after lunch.  I guess it's 'cause it's the only time during the day I drink cold beverage.  God that was neither informative nor entertaining.  So I was looking through EW this week, and I came across an ad for  40 Days and 40 Nights  and I have to admit I'm intrigued.  I mean the movie is gonna suck, big time, but I'll probably see it.  I mean Josh Hartnett forgoing all forms of sex for lent.  It must be fraught with sexual tension and inuendo.  Fun, Fun.  I on the other hand have never, nor will I ever, give up anything for lent.  I don't get it.  Even for religious folk.  How is that 'proving yourself to god' or some such shit.  I would always mock give up stuff like: Homework, or taxes, or better yet women.    Did I tell you guys...  wait I'll do a little search.  I guess not.  I work with a Tom Jones.  I think that's so funny.  I told someone this the other day and they started to laugh, so I'm like "It's not unusual."  In addition to that I work with a Brian Wilson, and it's fun fun fun, just like lying in bed.  To top it all off I think I heard a page once for a Dennis Hopper, but I'm looking into that.  Sorry for the pittiful puns.    Come on 5 o'clock... Come to daddy!

      I forgot my phone again today. FUCK!!!    But regaurdless, I think I'm moving next weekend.  I just gotta give the complex a call and make sure I can get a parking space.  Woo-Hoo!!  I'm psyched.  You can't see me, but I'm doing the running man right now.  God I wore out so many shoes and stubbed so many toes in the early 90's with that.  What in god's name were we thinking.  I mean dancing is supposed to be sexy (to an extent) or at least beautiful.  When was the last time you said "WOW!  Look  at that guy, he can run in place for hours while making ear-piercing noises with his Chuck Taylor's.  That is HOT!"  Or the cabbage-patch, I used to have a friend that was all about the cabbage-patch.  I would never dance with her 'cause she was uncoordinated and I got bruised.      So we made up our own, hot-hot dance moves like: Picking-up-the-change, climbing-the-wall, locking-the-door, and other daily activities, seemingly mundane, but foxy when the envelope was pushed.  Who am I kidding, it was just to make eachother laugh.  Getting 'sexy' outta those dances was like getting water from a rock.    Well I'm gonna go back to my silent desk and dream about furniture.

      Okay yeah I know I already updated this once this afternoon, but I have something to say now.    I don't know about the rest of you, but when I go out for a smoke I want a peaceful time to be with my thoughts, I DON'T want to make small talk with air-filter-replacing-mullet-man.  I mean what am I supposed to say "when are you gonna wake up and smell the 'mullets-suck'."  I mean, to some extent, they're beautiful, like all nature.  But like other critters they are to be observed occasionally for entertainment in their natural habitat, such as monster truck shows, wrestling matches, and country bars, not thrust into our world causing confusion and upheaval.  I was almost tempted to say, "Honey, we don't talk to the help."  What is a person to do when confronted with raw nature in an otherwise baked environment?  Do we A) nod and respond with short/noncommital phrases, or B) whip out the sheers and conduct displacement experiments?  I chose A, but B was eating away at me.  Maybe, to ensure the safety of everyone, especially the children, we should put them all on an island.    Well at least I was out there long enough to see cute firemen in uniforms.

      I'm not sure if this is a valid feeling.  Yesterday they came around with a card for a gift for one of my coworkers who had a baby.  This happens quite frequently.  I get kinda irked.  I don't know why.  Originally it was because I was here for a very short time.  Actually I saw the first one of them on my second day.  And since then there have been like 3 or so babies and 2 or so weddings.  I'm not made of money.  I know it's not a lot to give.  I can't figure out if that's the reason or it's just me being jealous of things that I will never have.  Go figure.  I could be that someone came by with a happy birthday sign and some candy for me yesterday.  It's not my birthday.  There is another Travis who started like last week, I guess it was his.  I didn't know they did such things here, since in my third month of working here my birthday came and left with no peanutbutter cups.  Can you still see me?  oh wait... you can't.    Sorry I'm in a funk, I think it's 'cause Im trying to get a heads up on the crest white strips 'cause I'm not gonna be home Friday, so I doubled up.  And man do my teeth hurt right now.

      I had a very interesting weekend.  Psha.  I did absolutely nothing.  I think the highlight of it was playing Egyptian Rat Screw with my sister.  I'm such a loser.  But she's so wacky sometimes.  She was really getting into it.  After ever game she'd be like "I'm getting all swetty."  She was a slapping fiend.  But I did get to watch  Newsies  and I almost cried, I would have if I didn't think Traci would get on me for it.  I just love that movie.  Maybe it's all the cute boys (okay, a good portion of them are of legal age, the others, well that's just sick) singing and dancing, and fighting.    Also I got quite a lot of QAF in.  I'm finally to episodes I've never seen.  I've come to the realization that it's not as bad as I had originally thought.  Strangely enough the lesbians are the best actors in the bunch, and are a large part of why I continue to watch.  Okay all the naked men contribute.  But I have a HUGE problem with the whole this is Pittsburgh thing.  I mean I lived there for four years and it's not that cool.  And they talk about the Susquehanna, okay dude there are three rivers in Pittsburgh and that is not one of them.  It's like 100 miles away in Harrisburg.  They also bring up my car: "The Audi TT is a fuck machine, the guys who drive it usually aren't."  Well... They just haven't met me... err... yeah that's it.    Well I'll hit you back when I'm awake later in the day.    By the way, is anyone else at work, I mean it's MLK day, show some respect.  I wanna go home.

      I think this is why I'm in such a good mood:     Let's do it     Workin' all week 9 to 5 for my money  So when the weekend comes I go get live with the honey  Rollin' down the street I saw this girl and she was pumpin'  I winked my eye she got into the ride went to a club was jumpin'  Introduce myself as Loc she said "You're a liar"  I said "I got it goin' on baby doll and I'm on fire"  Took her to the hotel she said "You're the king"  I said "Be my queen if you know what I mean and let us do the wild thing  Wild thing  Wild thing     Shoppin' at the mall looking for some gear to buy  I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly  She looked at me and smiled and said "You have plans for the night"  I said "Hopefully if things go well I'll be with you tonight"  So we journeyed to her house one thing led to an other  I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother  I didn't know what to say I was hanging by a string  She said "Hey you two I was once like you and I liked to do the wild thing"  Wild thing  She loved to do the wild thing  Wild thing  Please baby baby please     Posse in effect hangin' out is always hype  And when me and the crew leave the shindig I want a girl who's just my type  Saw this luscious little frame I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine  The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine  Took her to the limousine still parked outside  I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride  Couldn't get her off my jack she was like static cling  But that's what happens when body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing  Wild thing  She wanna do the wild thing  Please baby baby please  Wild thing     Doin' a little show at the local discotheque  This fine youg chick was on my jack so I say what the heck  She want to come on stage and do her little dance  So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance  So when the show was finished I took her around the way  And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say  We was all alone and she said "Tone let me tell you one thing  I need $50 to make you holler I get paid to do the wild thing"  Say what  Yo love you must be kidding  You're walkin' babe  Just break out of here  Hasta la vista baby  Wild thing.

      It's almost the weekend.  I'm working hard (strangely enough), but ecstatic.  I've changed modes from listening to music just at my desk, to wearing my earphones all around the office.  I get weird looks, but it makes me a happier worker.    I'm listening to that Carbon Leaf song.  I've been talking about it way too much this week.  Sorry. No I'm not, I have to put up with your shit like all the time, the least you can do is humor me for one goddamn minute!    I can't wait to do absolutely nothing this weekend.  I'm gonna watch the rest of QAF and Buffy, but that's about it.  I'm not even going to do laundry.  Oh shit I think I have to cook dinner for T & J this weekend.  Just in case I leave my sister's like you better cook for us.  I think I'm just gonna brown some chicken breast in olive oil and make some pasta.  Hell I like it.  And maybe throw together some Italian wedding soup. yum yum, bubble gum, in my tum, "gimme some!"    I'm in such a weird mood today.  I don't know if it's 'cause it's such a nice day, but who the hells knows.  I surely don't.  I kinda wish I had a digital video camera 'cause the birds were around again and I wanna show y'ins 'cause it's really cool.    Oh they were talking about Heinz field today on the radio and how some of the players from some other team were told to "mark their territory."  So they peed on the field.  I only wish that I had peed on it when I broke in 'cause then I'd call the station and be like "well I already marked it."    Well that's about it right now.  (I have to fight the urge to do a cartwheel down the halls of the office.  Does this happen to anyone else?  I just can't help grinning today.)

      I'm thinking of making up a faux excuse to go home.  Here's how the conversation would go:    T: I have to go I have an Appointment Mr. Boss Man, Mr. Big Boss, Mr. BOSS MAN BING!: With whom? T: Um... Errr... Um... My... Chronologist. BMB: Why are you seeing a Chronologist? T: He puts my life in order *rim shot*    Then the harp I stole from Scrooge McDuck start singing; "You are fibbing, fibbing, Fiiiiiibbiiiiing." and Flintheart Glomgold swipes my stud finder, as the Beagle Boys make off with my car, and Magica DeSpell turns me straight (ewww.), and Launchpad and Doofus continually trip in the corner while Webby plays dress-up with Bubba.    What was I talking about again?     Life is like a hurricane here in Duckburgh Racecars lasers airplains it's a duck-blurr might solve a mystery or rewrite history

      I'm getting so sick of  Creed .  I mean it's not like I don't like the music, but c'mon.   My Sacrifice  is no second comming of Christ.  Actually right now, I think due to my long commute, Im sick of quite a lot of bands, here's a short list: Creed Lenny Kravitz Red Hot Chili Peppers Jane's Addiction Smashing Pumpkins Dave Matthews Band    This is not to say that I don't like any of this music, it's just lay off the repeat.  And what is with Duncan Sheik?  Since when is  Barely Breathing  in heavy rotation?  I think I was on the East-Bumble-Fuck station.  I mean you just have to save a little of your fame for later use.  I mean we all know what happens when you overplay.  Any one of these could be you: Hootie Cranberries Spin Doctors Hanson (ewwww) TLC    Forgive me if I put any one-hit-wonders in there, I was going for one big album, one ok album, than jack.    I don't know what this rant was about, but whatever.  I can't wait to get DSL, 'cause Amazon alone has all these downloadable  songs .  Especially  The Boxer , I have no speakers at work, so I can't.  But if you do, give it a listen.  Or at least the sample.

      I'm like a zombie right now, and I've been sitting in a strange position for the past 2 hours so my butt's kinda asleep.    This morning I loaded my phone up with Travis song, so that's what I've been listening to.  But I'm feeling kinda losery 'cause I keep getting  Baby One More Time  in my head (Travis made a version of this, that's actually pretty good).  Well less than an hour 'till I get to go home.    I'll leave you with a song:  Kookaburra sits on an old gum tree Merry merry king of the bush is he Laugh Kookaburra Laugh Kookaburra Gay your life must be   ALL TOGETHER NOW   Kookaburra sits on an old gum tree Eating all the gumdrops he can see Stop Kookaburra stop Kookaburra Save some gums for me   ONE MORE TIME!   Kookaburra sits on an old gum tree Counting all the monkeys he can see Stop Kookaburra stop Kookaburra That's no monkey that's me     I don't know about you, but that woke me up.    ONE MORE TIME!

      Hey did anyone see the AMA's I didn't, but everyone (I mean radio) is talking about  urlLink Carbon Leaf  and I've heard one song on the radio.  It's big into the Irish thing, which I know is a little passe, but it's pretty darn-tootin' good.  But they're not really signed, so you can only get there CD in Richmond, which I'm not treking out there for a CD.  I'll just scour the web, when I get DSL.    So as the days progress I'm approaching definite on this apartment.  The deal is just pretty hard to pass up.    I was in Best Buy yesterday (there's a fuckin' surprise) and I got a little nervous due to my purchases.  I don't think I'm completely comfortable wearing my sexuality on my sleve, and that kinda bothers me.  I mean the way I dress it's a definite, but...  I don't know.  I just made the gayest purchase.  I bought Buffy Season 1, Newsies, Queer as Folk Season 1, and Moulin Rouge.  I mean I might as well been wearing capris pants and a midrif.  Am I a bad fag, or is my trepidation warranted?    But now it's work again.  I don't want to be here.  Just 8 more hours.  Well off to waste my youth and beauty at a computer.

      My last entry got me thinking:    Would you rather be smart, like us (only my friends read this and I'm not friends with stupid people.  Except...  well I don't want to get anyone mad at me) and pretty, like us (only my friends read this and I'm not friends with ugly people.  Except...  well I don't want to get anyone mad at me)...    OR.................................    Be dumb, like Melissa Rivers, and gorgeous like Mike Greybeal (or Jessica Alba for the ladies... actually she a great example, 'cause she's shit-rocks dumb)?    That's the big question, and I don't have an answer.  I would instinctively say "I'd like to be like me," but I would like to test out being ultra pretty.  Just for a month.  Can you imagine the ass you'd be able to get?  And maybe those stunads don't realize what it's like to have thoughts about the future, the world, politics, global warming, mandatory waiting periods for firearms acquisition, etc.    As Thomas Gray says: To each his suff'rings; all are men, Condemn'd alike to groan,—  The tender for another's pain, Th' unfeeling for his own.  Yet ah! why should they know their fate, Since sorrow never comes too late, And happiness too swiftly flies? Thought would destroy their paradise.  No more; where ignorance is bliss, 'T is folly to be wise.     And as Jessica Alba says: HUH?    Speaking of dumb my sister asked me for a review of fractions.  I started laughing at her: This comming from the girl who got one of the 2 A+'s in Criminal Procedure, I mean incredibly intelligent, but she wants a mult/div fraction lesson.  I told her to just use a calculator, and she's like "I was going to until my friends were talking about the final saying how they couldn't believe how some stupid people brought calculators to the exam."  She was sheepish, it was cute.

      Go me, I'm 3 lbs from my target weight.  I just checked this morning, but I don't know how reliable one weighing instance is.  'cause sometimes you havn't eaten in a while, or you drank a lot of water, or you took a really big shit, what have you.  So I hope it's for real.    My morning and evening routines have gotten longer.  I'm back on the Crest White strips.  They're the kick.  I think my teeth are currently at an acceptable level of whiteness.  (they were pretty bad before I did them in November)  Now I have a week and a half left.  So that twice a day.  Then I have like 6 new facial products to use, whereas before I had 1 (if that).  Also I shave like daily now, 'cause I don't want to put all crazy skin shit on my hairy faccia.  All in all I think it's working out, but my eyes are getting more easily tired.  And thanks to Jender and Swank for recommending Bumble and Bumble.  I like the styling creme.  (WHAT A FAG!)    And with my target weight almost accomplished I think that I may be ready to start working out.  (I have an easier time losing fat than transforming fat to muscle)  I can start with a blank slate (wait, it's clean slate, blank canvas.  I'm such a dumb-ass)    I just want to be pretty.

      Gee-Whiz I am sleepy.  I was up last night watching the Sopranos with my sis.  That show is the bee's knees.  I'm so psyched to have HBO if I move into that place.  And MTV considering the new season of Real World starts tomorrow.    I had a Hitchcockian moment earlier today.  I go outside for a nic-break right, and there are like 200 birds perched on the other building.  Then they swoop down into the trees that line the sidewalk in like a steady stream.  It was pretty cool.  I just wish they were louder (like crows not like chirp-chirp) and it was night.  I love having 'Birds' moments.  It's so spookey and fun.  But they were gone the next time I went out.    I forgot my phone again today.  I'm such a lame-ass.    Knob-it,

      So I checked out that place, and I'm gonna give it a favorable review.  Not because it's so rad, but because I'd have money to have fun with.    It'd save me like 5 C-notes a month.  And we all know how I like to spend.  So I'm jazzed.  Speaking of which I'm all about this line of Crate and Barrel shit.  I'm looking for some pics to link to.   Desk  and  Bed  Do ya like it?  There's also these  shelves     And my sis showed me this crap she got at Target, like desk accessories etc. that would go great.    Well I'm off to think about moving.    Oh shit...  I just noticed, the 5 shelf shelves (redundancy) are no longer available, I should go back to the store and snatch a coupla those bad boys up.  Maybe this weekend.  This would also separate some of my furniture into different months credit card bills.  And stave off my compulsive instant gratification desire.  THE REASONS ARE THREE-FOLD!!!

      Tonight I go look at that place I was talking about yesterday.  I hope it's cool.  I have nothing much to say today.  I've been a little nervous, 'cause I want this to work out.  Smoking a lot.  I hope he's normal, and not ugly, but not too attractive.  (Is it weird to have stipulations about how the person you live with looks?  Well I guess not so much weird, but shallow)  I don't know, It's been like 3 years since I've lived with someone I didn't know.  I just hope the age difference doesn't show too much, 'cause I still want to be able to watch cartoons and play video games.  Look at me running off at the mouth when it's not even definite.    Whatever, I need a cigarette...

      To begin today, a little update.  Oral-skank still hasn't gotten back to me, but I did get a response from someone else.  Now tell me what you think.  $625 (excellent), all utils including DSL and cable (right on), parking etc.  Sounds too good, well it may be.  He's 32 and his screen name involves the numbers 69.  I'm a little concerned about this.  Maybe he's just juvenile enough to think that that number is funny or something, but didn't we grow out of that in like 6th grade?  Well I mailed him back and asked some questions.  Move-in would be mid-Feb.  And on the map it looks really easy to get to from the east.    Okay on to a new subject.  My sister brought this up last night.  On Jeopardy they just say "in the form of a question," and they don't really expound on that, so she was like "If I got on Jeopardy instead of saying 'What is Jupiter?' I'd say 'Is it Jupiter?'"  This went back an forth until we got a little out of hand, here's some possibilities for Jeopardy answers:    Old Way: What is... an American Bulldog? Where is... Milan? Who is... Elizabeth Taylor? What is 'On Top of Old Smokey?' What is... Pizza?    New Way: Did I just run over... an American Bulldog? Do they have whorehouses in... Milan? Does anybody really care about... Elizabeth Taylor? Have you ever had sex... 'On Top of Old Smokey?' Do you throw up from eating too much... Pizza?    See the improvement? I do. Stimu-lator

      Today's getting better.  I'm making myself laugh.  Also I went to Wendy's for lunch in memoriam.  When I got in there  Travis  was playing on the sound system.  I was like "Even from Heaven, Dave Thomas, you have wonderful taste."  But then the guy charged me 50 cents for some BBQ sause.  Snot-nosed-older-than-me-yet-working-at-Wendy's ASS!    Looking back on today I think I would do things differently to be funny.  D'ya ever do that?  It's kinda annoying, 'cause you're like "Damnnit, I coulda been funny, but instead I was a sniveling mule."  This morning when the police officer was waving me over (he was on foot), I should have just looked at him stupidly and waved.  Pretending he was just being cordial.  Now that would've been funny.    And at Wendy's today, when that guy charged me for some topping that probably cost 30 pesetas I shoulda been like "Dude, show some respect.  Dave Thomas died today.  Now you gotta ask yourself: What would Wendy's founder Dave Thomas Do?"    Ooh, that's a good bumper sticker, WWWFDTD.  Maybe not, it either sounds like a web site for flower delivery, or something you'd find on  Sunday Smackdown .    Well at least I'm feeling a little more up.  Maybe that's because I've decided not to stay late today, maybe not, who the fuck am I kidding, of course that's why.

      Today SUCKS!!!    And it's only 9, I can't wait to see what happens later.    1) I forgot my phone so the only way I have music to listen to is if I go outside to get my CDs out of my car.    2) I got a ticket this morning, 44 in a 25 (School Zone).  Fuck that, I swear I was going 35, I was still in 3rd gear.  I'm going to do some internet research into the efficacy of Laser in adverse conditions.    3) I haven't heard back from the Dentist Bitch (I'm sure she's perfectly nice).    4) I may or may not be allergic to some of the skin care products I've been using; I can't stop sneezing.    5) I can't think of number 5.    6) I'm going to Jender's tonight, and without a phone have no way of letting her know what to order from Red Pepper (If you're reading this just pick something that we wrote "good" next to)    7) Dave Thomas, Wendy's founder and friend to all grease lovers, died.    So Have a Fucking Good Day!  I know I won't.    PS. Hey I think I may have come up with some sort of general idea for a script, but I have to flush it out in order to see if it would make a good flick.  Hey it keeps my hands occupied, otherwise there'd be a party in my pants every hour on the hour.

      I am a marketers wet dream.    I saw this little piece in Entertainment Weekly (my bible) about a line of skin care products for men.  So I decided to get some.  I've never really used any, and I'm entering my self-betterment phase of the year, so I bust out the plastic and head for the mall.    The only place I could find them was Saks, and I must say I was not really pleased with their service.  I guess the 2 foot shelf for men's skin care is not really a money maker, but honestly.  I was browsing the shelf for Zihr for like 20 minutes, and not a single querry about how my search was going.  I go to check out and the woman was helping someone else while taking my credit card, so I didn't get to ask any questions.  Meanwhile I was borderline going to buy the shaving gel if I could've gotten a price from her, but nothing, so I said no.    So I get home after dropping a sizable load of cash, and that night I wanted to use the stuff, so I had to shave first (weekends are usually razor free for my lazy ass).  My sister flipped out when she heard the water running so long, she's like "You're shaving at midnight???"  So I started using.  I bought the undereye cream (I'm such a mo), 'cause I have a genetic predisposition for black bags (and I don't mean Prada).  So I think I have to call one of my lady friends to see how to use this stuff.  I got bottles galore each with it's 10-words-or-less instructions so I'm kinda confused.  And also I'm curious about how long before it kicks in.  I mean if you start using moisturizer is you face instantly gonna stop producing oil, or do you have a coupla days with too much?  I hope I continue to use 'cause if not there's a Benjamin down the toilet.    Also I may have found a suitable place to live.  I gotta see if this 26 yr old Dentist chick responds to my e-mail.  Cross you fingers!

      I feel off today.    I was all swervy on the road this morning, but now I'm all in the zone at work.  I'm designing my ass off.  Well not really just improving on some things I half-assed earlier.    So last night I went to Borders to get an oragami one-a-day calendar, but they were out, so I bought a Screenwriting book instead.  It's interesting, I didn't realize how structured the process is.  Now all I need is to come up with an idea.  I hope it comes to me soon.  But until then I should read the whole book before I foray into that process.  The woman at the store was like "oh, are you a screenwriter?"  and I'm like "no, I just needed a hobby for this month."  I fly through things so quickly.  I'd be surprised if I'm still interested in this come The Buffy Season 1 DVD release (Jan 15th, mark your calendars).  But I like to dabble in lots of hobbies, 'cause this way I get to learn a little about a lot of industries.  It makes a well rounded person, or at least a good Trivial Pursuit player.    Well that's about it.  Later

      I don't really feel like writing today.  Sorry.  I just don't feel funny, and I hate mediocre entries.  Sue me.    Oh last night I had an awesome dream.  D'ya ever have one of those love dreams.  Like full on chick-flick love.  Complete with sidestories, annoying secondary characters, and melodrama (the gays love their melodrama).  It was awesome.  I didn't want to wake up.  Much more satisfying than a sex dream, I mean I can much more efficiently handle  that  in the waking hours.    Here's to thinking about my dream man.

      Shit...    Back at work after a kicking New Year in Manhattan.  I had so much fun.  We went out like every night hang bummed all day.  But not much of it is funny beside the New Years party itself.    Well first off, do you know that there's this channel in NYC that plays  ads for porn?  It's great, but they wouldn't let me watch it.  Girls can be such prudes.  Oh and Friday night I run into an old friend from College at a bar in Union Square, I hadn't seen her in like 2 years.  NY is a lovely yet strange place.    Anywho, So we went out to the  China Club  at arount 8:30 or so.  It opened at 10, and there was no line so we went to a bar across the street for a round.  (meanwhile I had half a dozen beers at Netsie's place)  Get back in line about a half hour before the doors open, and it's FREEZING.  There was a girl in front of us smoking and I thought she looked cold, so I offered to give her one of my gloves.  So we all started talking and her other friends showed up.  One was from Birmingham, and I'm like (in my head) "Alabama?"  But then he started talking and he was obviously from England.  So he asked us where we were from and I'm like "Originally, Connecticut."  Well it turns out he's staying with people from Fairfield, right near my home Trumbull.  So Glove Girl was like "Do you know Ellen Tollman?"  and I'm like "Yeah, I touched her breast in 6th grade." I was off the hook.    So we get in and have a lot of fun drinking and dancing.  All of a sudden I notice that there's nobody on the Stage, so I jump on and start dancing, draging a friend with me.  So a little while after that I'm up on a block on the stage and I lose my balance.  I face-plant on stage.  Bam Bitch went down.  I was craking up so hard    Then a friend of mine wanted to go, so I made sure she knew how to get home and let her go.  Okay not my most chivalrous act, but it was like 12:30 and I wanted to partay!  About an hour or so later another one bites the dust and boots on the floor (and a little on my new shoes I might add).  So Netsie packed her up and headed for the coast.  So we were down to 3.    3 am rolls around and I can't find any of the remainder of our crew.  Finally we hook up and take off.  By this time Times Square (which we had to majorly bypass to get to the club) was now kinda empty making it a straight shot across 47th.  We make a quick stop at McDonalds.  I order a double cheeseburger meal.  When it shows up I get all pissed and am like "There's only one!  I have two patties and one bun!  What the hell am I supposed to do?"  Well it turns out I really wanted the two cheeseburger meal, so I could share, but I was too gone to think straight.  (I have the same problem with Twin and Double beds, I can never remember which is which)    So the next day I get up at 9:20 and have to walk 12 blocks to meet my sister at my brother's place.  But with some new bruises a strained shoulder and a kicking new limp.

      I had a weird dream last night about acid rain and the Looney Toons.  Sylvester's umbrella dissolved and his hair fell out.  But that's all I can remember, maybe I saw it on TV?  Maybe it wasn't a dream at all?  Hrmmm...    It's the little things in life that make you happy.  If I get into work and there's already coffee made I start beaming.  But I always have to feel the pot 'cause sometimes it's just yesterday's afternoon coffee. (that stuff is just raunch)    Still no word from Femme-DDS.  I'm starting to lose confidence.  You've done nothing but study swordplay?  Eeh... More a pursue than a study.  Have you ever considered Piracy?  You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.  Sorry got a little Princess Bride on the brain.    I'm gonna pay my ticket over the phone, I don't think VA transfers points  .  I hope not.  How funny would it be if I had to find a job in the city and couldn't drive my car 'cause I got dropped from insurance.  Well not really funny considering It's hard to find Engineering jobs IN cities.  And then my beautiful baby would become like a hemmorrhaging abscess on my bank account.  (dictionary.com just got like 3 hits for that one)    But all-in-all things are looking up, and settling down, after the money suck that was the holiday season.  Friday I look forward to tons-o-fun at Swank's swanky new pad.      Oh, did anyone catch the Real World Chicago thingy that was on last night.  Well it sucked, but I have a new love.  Chris the gay guy from Mass.  He's lovely.  But a recovering alcoholic, so that wouldn't really work out.  But I look forward to some hot man-on-man action this year.  Hopefully it's not lame like last year.  It's kinda sad that I still watch this.  I'm 22 you'd think I'd have my own life.  Now I have to feed vicariously off 7 losas.  Well maybe this year 6 losas and a hottie.    Off for more Coffee... Annihi-lator

      So as the day rises anew I contemplate the efficacy of my rapport with the human species.  Have I lost all propencity for serious thought?  I find myself have trouble going 10 minutes without crackin' wise...  OH MY GOD! Who was that?  It wasn't me.  Well tonight I get to go out.  WOOHOO!!!  I put myself on a $100 stipend this week, 'cause I was running low on cash (realistically I didn't think I could do it).  But tomorrow's pay day and I have $89 buck in the wallet.  Go T$$.  I know all of you are probably like "thank god.  That dude's been dull since he hasn't been hungover."  And believe me I'm with you.  I'm only really funny when I'm in incredible discomfort.  But I'm still gonna take it easy tonight.  'Cause I'm still gonna watch a little must-see-tee-vee.  Well that's good.. um... yeah... good times... Well feel free to type a little su'in su'in in the tagboard, it makes me feel loved.

      So I kicked Netflix into high gear.  But today has been boring, I've been staying in all week, and I'm ready to go out, but I'm gonna wait at least until Thursday.  I'm not really feeling particularly funny today, or interesting, or even awake, so I'm gonna keep this really short.  Well I'll catch you guys on the flip side. (it's Wednesday... here's hoping for omelettes tomorrow)

      A few things today: I was listening to the radio this morning, and some people are nuts.  On  WHFS  (who I think is trying to get a little edgier) they were at the Grammy's talking to porn stars, and there was either taking pictures of unclothed women or oral sex, I was switching during the commercial.  And, in the spirit of  Grand Theft Auto ,  Elliot  was talking about a game he wants to get backing for, where you're terrorists who take over the Olympics, which I think is a little too out there.  Reguardless of wether or not it's fun, I just think it's too reckless.      However I came up with a game that has edge, and also is less politically offensive.  It's called  Homeless  or maybe  Grifters  but the latter is a little more restrictive.  I'd like it to be a rags to riches adventure where it begins with some simple panhandling/pickpocketing/mugging then progressess to grifting/prostitution/robbery and from there to cock-fights/drug-trafficking/pimping and finally to wetworks/heisting/kidnapping.  And along the way your personal concerns will change as well.  In the beginning your only goal will be securing hootch and rinsing out your only pair of socks, but by the end it will be setting up an offsure bank account in Grand Cayman, and buying a mansion in a non-extradition country.

      Well here's another dream, it didn't come last night 'cause I woke up every 10 minutes for some reason, but rather yesterday napping in the noontime sun.  (Check out  White Stripes  -  Fell in Love with a Girl ... That's good punk)    So I had this dream where I went to my distant cousin's house for a funeral.  I was walking around talking to people, and noticing that there was a lot of inappropriate touching between men for calling hours (Is that even what it's called?).  So I'm on my cell with e ('cause that's like all I do lately).  I drop the phone and go to pick it up, but I can't hear anything anymore.  Then I hear a little "hello-hello" comming from my water glass.  I just kept running up to people laughing and saying "hey my friend's stuck in this glass." - "Say something to this woman Erica."  Then I realize that both the microphone and the speaker of my phone are rolling around in the glass.  I shut up 'cause I feel stupid now.  Meanwhile back in the funeral of inappropriate fondling, clothes are kinda comming off and I'm perplexed.  I turn to my friend and am like, "I'm getting the feeling that this is not so much my cousin's house as it is a gay brothel."  I guess I got the address wrong.  Ooops.    Meanwhile back on earth.  I think I either have a food alergy or a gum inflamation.  I'm not happy with it.

      I have seen the face of god, and damn that boy is fine.  No really, I went out last night and I have about 30 nightime don'ts for you.  So after I stupidly forgot to get tickets for the hypnotist and Jender went home I went out a bar (yeah, news to whom?).  I want to appologize to everyone I called last night.  Especially e who got a call at like 3, or as I like to call it 90 minutes into my walk home (hang on I'm getting there).    So I'm out at a bar that's playing the gayest moments in movies, or some such shit.  Like the funeral from  Steel Magnolias  the first performance from  Sister Act  etc.  I see the hottest person in the world (my fucking luck, he was a bartender, Mike... Mark... Milk...  It's not important), so I go talk to him.  Long story short I make friends with 3 really hot guys (him his boyfriend, and a friend from NYC).  At least I got to see two really hot guys kiss.    So they invite me to a club, it was fun, but I'm not sure how frequently I can take that.  This was like the hottest selection of guys I've seen in my life, but shallow like a fox.  I need to work out, 'cause just losing weight makes my skinny, but not hot.  These guys were all shirtless and gorgeous, and meanwhile I'm like "I've had 5 hours of sleep since thursday, gimme a break."  (So I pretty much fell asleep 4 times on the dancefloor).  Okay I think were ready for the don'ts, this story got boring.    I think the best part of going out is checking your pockets the next day... It's a veritable who's who of crap.    DON'T: 1. Don't go Out to a club with ppl. you've known for like 30 minutes, even if they're hot, 'cause they don't have your back. (okay like 2 hours is okay) 2. Don't call your friend for confirmation of your prettyness on Saturday, 'cause they ain't home, and they just get really worried and call you later when you have no idea who they are and when sequins came back into style. 3. Don't call them at 9 the next morning either, 'cause they're just mad. 4. Don't go to a club on no sleep, 'cause you ain't looking pretty. 5. Just because you see the Washington Monument does not mean you can walk home. 6. When thinking about walking home, call a cab, it's easy to romanticize but 2 hours later when you have the beer shits from the previous night it's not fun. 6. Don't question black earwax... it's just happens sometimes. 7. When your on an exodus walking home and you come across train tracks, find another way, don't hop the fence and narrowly dodge an approching train. 8. Don't 'balance-beam' on a railing 30 feet above traffic, while tango-ing with an oak. 9. Don't go out when you're still hungover, 'cause the beer shits catch up to you while you're walkin' past the Smithsonian. (worth mentioning twice.)    Okay Peace out. Live it Learn it Love it.     Note: preceding event have been exaggerated for humorous effect, I was really not in danger, even e thinks so.

      Yeah, I'm messed up, I just spent the last hour and a half staring at a chicklet,  So much has happened since last we talked.  Well I sent out my tax stuff to my dad (okay lame start, but I'm saving the good stuff for later), and instead of a return address I put:  Jo Babbydaddy He knows Where!  It made me laugh, I'm gonna have to explain ebonics to him though.  So I went out last night.  I think there's a conspiracy against gays in that people are trying to keep us drunk.  'cause when I was straight I never went to bars that had whole nights where beer was free.  I mean how spiteful can you be.  So I was there with Spark and I went to "buy" the next round.  I find out when I get back that Goodyear asked him if we were up for a threesome.  He's like "No, sorry."  But to me he's like I wanted to pull out a little Karen and be like "Tubby I don't think so."  Me I was like I wanted to pull out a little Karen and be like: "Aww, Honey, why don't you head over to Bob's Big Boy and pick up a leg a wing and a biscuit.  There's a threesome, that's more your speed.  HaHaHa, I'm even funny with the rabble...  I'm Chris Rock."  Spark was cracking up and was like: "Oh yours was much better."  He's right you know.    So later that evening, (yeah I missed MK skate, but I'm glad I would have cried) I hit on some boys.  Most of which had boyfriends... or lovehandles.  But this one I was givin' the hungry eye to was cross room flirting.  Nothing became of it, so a few hours later I approached and was like "I'm doing some market research.  Why didn't you respond to the eye?"  I'm totally not kidding.  I'm such an ASS!  I was T-Ravis-Rashed.  But I gathered some good info on his demo, and got a few nice compliments.  But that sucked... compliments don't play the piper.    So I get home at like 4-5-6.  Honey, I don't remember, I was too tired.  And I wake up at like 10.  All last night I was professing how I was gonna call in sick, but I didn't here I am at work.  So I drive in and I'm all about getting McD's breakfast (hungover happy).  So I pass two Don's in the Disctrict, and make my way to Annap.  I get to the one here at 10:45 and I'm like "Are you still serving breakfast."  The guy laughed at me and was like "No, we stop serving at 10:30."  I wanted to be like "Dude, you don't have to laugh, it's 10-freakin-45, it's not like it's 3."  So I go to pull out and low and behold little Ms. Hunchback with a dog backs into my Sgt. Hughes.  F'that.  I need to get work done now, I'd be rippin' mad if I wasn't so funny.    So I had this excuse all prepared.  'cause everyone else at work uses their kids to get outta stuff (yeah like I buy that Timmy needed to go to the "doctor").  So I'm all ready to be like: "Sorry, Janey had a dentist appointment and the little one got an earache, but what are you gonna do?  at that age, you just can't get mad at them.  Even though you just wanna hit them and take away their walking privledges."  But I didn't have to use it since I got into that accident.    A coupla new things.  My favorite thing to say now when people bring up current events that I'm not familiar with is to say, "oh I'm sorry, I don't watch straight porn."  That and I started answering the phone by saying "Go ahead caller, you're on the air."  Also, and this is the best one.  I slipped up and said: "That is so sugar."  Instead of sweet, I think I'll keep that one.    Pop-u-later

      I'm so bored that I'm playing a rubber band rendition of  Mr. Sandman :    Bum-bum-bum-bum, Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream Bum-bum-bum-bum Make him the cutest boy I've ever seen Bum-bum-bum-bum    What time does Michelle skate tonight?  'cause I may wanna go out.  Go Kwan, go Kwan, get funky.  I was talking to Tim, and I'm like wouldn't it be funny if my deal was that I shot people with rubber bands, but right before I struck a pose?  They'd call me  The Rubber Bandit  and my sidekick would be  Paper Clipto .  We would rob from places like Staples and Office Max.  Hehe, I'm insane... no really.

      So something in the hall is making noise like a wind up toy.  I'm so tempted to run around the office saying "Is somebody playing Scategories!!! I want in!"    I think if I win Powerball tonight I'm gonna rent a little old lady to come in to work with me tomorrow and set up and omelette station.  I could go up to everybody and be like: "Hey have you guys eaten, 'cause Edna here makes a killer omelette.  GET BACK IN THERE BITCH!!! YOU'RE ON THE CLOCK AND WE'VE GOT SOME TAKERS!"  Nothin' says share the happy like an omelette made to order.

      I know I just posted an entry, but I needed to get this off my chest before I forgot.  My officemate is just  on  today, he's been making me laugh all morning.  When I told him about my  Daily Grind  idea (which, after a discussion with Jender last night, has incorporated personalized catalog shopping, sound cool?  Send money and I'll get it on it's feet) and he's like "Ooh, like  The Peach Pit  and   The Peach Pit After Dark ."  Hehe.  but better yet is what just happened.  See, lately I've been havin' a hankerin' for a McD's breakfast (a BEC 'scuit to be exact), and I was talking about how they should delive.  Then I went on to tell him how someone I was talking to live in a place where they had McPizza and they dilivered.  So this is how it went down.  Keep in mind I was trying to say 'Test Market'.  (Look at me, it's like I'm setting up for a blooper.  I'm Dick Clark introducing a Carol Burnette flub)     Me:  So I was talking to someone and they had McPizza in their area, I think they lived in... ah... What's that called?  Tim:  Um... I don't know... The Czech Republic?    I cracked up.  I hope that translated well, but I'm not sure, it was one of those timing thing, Like Jender's "Haa cha cha!!!"  this weekend.

      So did you catch Michelle Kwan's performance last night?  It was pretty good.  I was torn 'cause that was on at the exact same time that the UCONN game was winding down (FYI: they were down by 5 through like the entire 2nd half, they just couldn't protect from the 3's and giving up a lot of boards [geeze you'd almost think I was straight], but somehow things turned around when Michelle was skating, she's done so much for me [okay not too straight]).  I think I OD'd on parentheticals.  I don't know why I like Kwan so much; maybe it's 'cause I think that she's a good role model, a good symbol of America, or maybe it's because she's really my mother.  And a good showing by the other Americans going 3-4.  Woo Hoo.  That stupid Slutskaya ruined the 1-2-3.  I don't trust that girl.  She once gave me a breath mint, and I woke up 4 days later in a onesie in Georgia with a  South of the Border  sticker on my ass.    Damn I'm wierd.  I'm becomming one of those crazys (thats what we call my cousins from West Virginia).  I'm thinking of going to see a hypnotist this weekend.  He was on the radio this morning and it seemed like a lot of fun.  I'd like to participate, 'cause I think that I'm funny anyway, so maybe under the influence, I'd be a laugh riot.  People at work probably think I'm very strange, I'm chair dancing right now to  Basement Jaxx  -  Where's Your Head At , it's funny 'cause it's true.    Last night after watching a very homophobic  Blossom ... erm... I mean  Real World  and a new ep of QAF, I was flicking and put on  Darkwing Duck .  Spark got a weird look on his face, and I'm like; "That's okay we can put something else on, I'll just watch it in 10 years when nostalgia is in." HAHAHAHAH!!! I'm cracking up, but not because of that, that was kinda lame, but because of the onesie joke before.

      So I'm back on a dream of days past ( see past ).  I've been thinking a lot about winning powerball and opening  The Daily Grind .  But now it's expanded to be a coffee shop/bar/bowling/pool etc.  (ooh, ooh, and maybe it could have like a neon strickthrough and the word Nightly, so at night the name changes)  The best part is I'd sell magazines.  Y'know how it is when you're like: "Hey let's go get some magazines."  And your friend is like "Wicked idea, but where do they sell those?"  Look no further.  But it wouldn't be very successful 'cause I don't like stress, but I wouldn't mind 'cause I'd have my PB winnings.  God, why can't  I  have a failing business.  I'd also have  Trivial Pursuit  cards all around, 'cause I was at a place where they did and I thought it was cool.  What else, oh yeah, boxed wooden matched only.  Can't you picture it?  I'd call you up and say "Come on down to  The Daily Grind ," I'd say, "It's half price  Corona  and  Condé Nast ."    Gotta go; I just choked on my own spit, damn I'm a moron.

      Good Morning, Good Morning, we've talked the whole night through, good morning good morning to you.    Not to me, I'm beat.  I got in late, but it's president's day, and I for one think that nobody should be working, let alone me.  My excuse was that since schools are out I had to find an appropriate day care for my kids.  Like I'd ever have kids.  I dried my sweater way too much.  It's tight.  Even for me.  I guess people at work will just think I'm even stranger.  I guess it doesn't help that my jeans have big cuffs at the bottom 'cause I have to wear them low to accomadate the tattoo.  Hey when it's all better I'll put a nice picture up of it.  It's zzzexy.    I'm so pathetic, just looking at those z's made me tired.

      So it's sunday night and I'm trying to decide what position I will play in this new society that I have become a member of.  I have to get past my shyness, but I fear that I may go too far.  I don't want to become the slut, or do I?  It's also a valid position, but I'm not sure what's for me.  I've realized that I'm young, and hot, and pretty much, I can decide what I want.    Is it lots of sex with people I don't know, or is it something more?    I don't know

      I had a dream that I came home and there were a dozen boxes of  Harry and David  pears on my doorstep.  Why am I subconsciously getting fruit delivered?  Maybe it's 'cause my mom hasn't ordered me any  Omaha Steaks  in a while.  I'm such a spoiled brat.    Okay so last year my brother got me these  Deisel  jeans and they're awsome, but I was fat then, and they're about 3 inches too big in the waist.  So now I look at myself in the mirror, and even though I'm swimming in these puppies I look fat.  But I'm done losing weight, and I can't aford to get another pair.  So here's my idea.  Do you think I can call my mom and ask if she'll pay for it?  I mean it's for my health.  Maybe not.    I was listening to the radio this morning and they were talking about fights at supermarkets. This pharmacist said that some guy came in with a forged prescription and he refused to fill it.  A few minutes later he was beaned by a can of  Ensure  I had to laugh, I can just picture it: "To your health Fucker!" (Whooosh - Boink!) Hehe.

      Happy freakin' Valentine's Day to all you.  Every year I think I should be all depressed on this day, but for some reason I'm not.  I mean I've never really had anyone on this day, so I guess I don't know what I'm missing.  I guess when it comes down to it, I'm gonna get depressed about not only this day, but the other 364 as well.  I guess it doesn't help that my hair is looking a little...  well lets not get into that... I think I have to go see a doctor about a certain... shit I don't wanna talk about it.  It's not like it's getting bad, but I've just talked to a few people who are like "nip it in the bud."  I mean my bro has had his share of difficulty with it, and he always warns me, not to mention my trick this weekend said something about early action.  (yeah like that wasn't embarrassing)    This is fucking great, now I'm in a spectacular mood.  Why'd you have to bring this shit up.  Thanks a lot!    On another note, I think I am done dieting.  I looked at myself in the mirror and I'm like: "hey, you're skinny."  And not just straight skinny, that's easy, but gay skinny.  So I can eat what I want now.  I think I'm still gonna stick to diet coke (damn Freud will not let me type that word cleanly) 'cause I don't wanna rebound.    Okay I'm in a better mood.  And hey you gotta be happy when you only have one day left of your moneyless week.    Hey check out  Phantom Planet  -  California  it's really good

      How 'come cartoon pigs all have stutters?  Porky, Piglet, I'm sure there have been others.  What is it about the pig that we find it is necessary to impede their speach.  Is it 'cause they are so cute in drawn form we must even the score so the other barnyard animals don't get jealous?  It was just a general wondering-ment I was having.    Geeze I'm ready to go home.  I'm so tired.  If you were to ask me to pick up a brick right now I'd say: "Fuck no, pick it up your own damn self."  Did I mention I was cranky too.

      Damn it's hump day.  I was listening to the raadio today and they were talking about this event they're having comming up called Kegs and Eggs.  It's a party from 8am-noon.  It sounds like a lot of fun, but it's on a friday.  It seems kinda messed up to take a whole day off just for a four hour party.  And it seems like the think that you may stumble home from not walk.  But Carbon Leaf is playing.  I'll think about it, it's a month from friday (2 days prior to Jender's Birthday).    On another note I just ran out of money (I mean until friday).  I kinda flipped out yesterday about it.  Then I realized I have another check before next rent.  It's just with these alimony payments now, I have to rebudget.  Yeah I know that's a lie, but I thought it was better than I spent $300 on a blanket and a pillow.  Sometimes I just have to give myself a knowing look and say: "Where's your head at?"

      So I've been watching the Olympics a lot.  I love it. But last night was heartbreaking.  What happened during the pairs free-skate (long program).  It was Canada hands down.  The the Canadians were like "This is horseshit... you call this a sport... We skated our asses off."  Oh wait that was DB Sweeny.      Then I caught the end of the US men's curling match against Canada.  Not pretty.  We conceeded at 9-3 in the 9th.    But I guess I couldn't be too upset with the men's halfpipe sweep by Americans.  That was awesome.  Single-handedly put us back in the medal run lead with Germany.  I love that shit.  I almost cried when I saw all three American flags going up.  It gets me.  Kinda like that commercial with the guy who takes a picture of himself sleeping and writes "wish I was here xx," on it.  It melts me.

      So I'm thinking of getting another tatoo.  Well I've wanted one for a while, but here's my reasoning.  I want to get it on my tummy.  For one I think it's sexy, but also I think it may deter me from getting fat, 'cause I wouldn't want to stretch it.  It would also detract from my less than washboard abs (or maybe it'd accent them, who knows).  So what do you think?  I'm not sure if they'd let me since my navel is pierced, maybe it's like a cart before the horse sorta thing.  But I don't know what I'd get.  The first one I had planned for a while, so I knew what I wanted, but this one, I'm not sure.  If you have any suggestions  urlLink guestbook  me.  I know I don't want any living things like dragons or lizards (I don't do that tounge thing...) nor birds of prey.  Plants?  ehhh... I think I like designs.  Well if I get bored today I'll doodle.    Pinches for all-

      I'm officially the stupidest person in America.    I was doing laundry today while talking to e.  I get back to my place and realize that I locked myself out.  Okay lets set the stage.  I did a little drinking last night (and got a little lucky too) so today I have those pesky beer shits.  So I'm locked outta my apartment with no shoes, and none of the maintnance people are home... 'cause I'm that unlucky.  But what I could do was finish my laundry (read silver lining).  Wait I can't finish this right now I need to shower I still have sex on me.    Okay clean as a whistle.  And one of my neighbors was singing really loudly.  I took that time (I was given the gift of time) to catch up on my correspondence (there wer too many  Friends  quotes in there).  So then singer/songwriter with a clay mask came out and tried to help me locate someone to let me in.  Finally I had e scratch up my roomate's cell.  So I give him a call.  He's in Baltimore.  An hour later I realize I have my emergency plastic key and I can go get cigarrettes outta my car.  I go down into the grage closing the (locked) door behind me effectivly trapping me in the garage.  Luckily when I finished the cigarrette my roomate drove in.  I was soo happy.  He was carrying a big box so he threw me the keys, and as a good gay man I missed them.  They hit my square in the right nut.  A perferct end to a perfect day.

      I am officially - borderline - alcoholic.  I woke up this morning at 7 on my bathroom floor covered in vom and with heavy boxers.  I've never shat myself before, I guess there's a first time for everything.  I'm so embarassed.  That's why I'm telling all you's guy's.  I have to go shopping for our party soon.  See this is the shit that happens when I hang out with my brother.  I'm just glad I wasn't in bed, 'cause I have expensive sheets.    I think I danced with Annie last night.  You know the little orphan.  Dog by the name of Sandy.  She's okay, but really cheap.  She claims she's had a "hard knock life" and I'm like take a number sister, I just crapped myself.

      CAN YOU FEEL THAT? AW SHIT OOOH-AH-AH-AH-AH!    It's friday.  And if anyone can't tell I have DSL.  It's like I've been freed from a 4 year prison of slow transfers and drop offs.  I don't even know when I went to bed I was having fun looking for... um music... yeah.  If you wanna talk to me I'll be on IM a lot more.  I'll still be away all day at work, but at nights.  It's the kick I d/l'd like 8 songs before work today, including Disturbed's  Down with the Sickness  (which explains the intro).    I think my brother is comming to town today.  Which means one thing.  Wasted friday.  I gotta find out soon what we're gonna do 'cause we have that party tomorrow night.    Do you know what today is?  It's day one of the 19th Winter Olympic Games.  I'm so psyched, but the only thing on today is ski jumping.  Well everyone enjoy their day I know I will.  And here's a little playlist to think of:     Carbon Leaf  -  American Tale   Disturbed  -  Down with the Sickness   Hoobastank  -  Crawling in the Dark   Social Distortion  -  Ball and Chain   Jimmy Eat World  -  In the Middle   Remy Zero  -  Save Me   Phantom Planet  -  California

      Sometimes I'm not the brightest bulb on the chandelier.  I'm trying to hook in to pre-existing DSL connection, and I'm not to sure about the things I'm gonna need.  I hate networks.  I don't know if it's me, but I'm not sure if my deoderant is working.  I think a certain Old Spice is gonna have to buy a certain someone a stick of his old stuff.    Tuesday when I was out, I was playing pool.  I had a few drinks so I was shooting really poorly.  I actually used the phrase "well, at least I'm pretty."  I think it shows a lot fo personal growth.  I hope I'm getting past my poor self-image thing.  I mean listeng to someone's self-mutilating banter is about as fun as listening to two bluejays at a Melissa Etheridge concert.    So I guess I'm off to drop a few bills this afternoon too.  Shit, but as I always say: "You gotta spend money to watch porn."

      Someone just googled to me by searching for: "Communism in North America."  Boy were they dissapointed.  Well I'm just assuming, 'cause I didn't actually talk to them.    I've been thinking lately about people that were once in my life that I lost touch with.  One in particular.  She was my best friend from like 2nd grade 'till 8th grade.  I haven't talked to her in like 5 years.  Whenever I run into people from THX I ask them about her, but I never seem to run into her.  I guess part of me just kinda misses her.  I mean this is the girl with whom I organized apple sauce straw races in elementary school.  (Which is how I still eat the stuff, and where I got my fondness for sucking stuff.  Sorry, that was both disturbing and ill-timed)    Well I guess I'll never talk to her, but maybe next year at our 5 year.  Damn I need a date.  Oh, but you don't really show up to 5 yr's with a date, that's more of a 10 yr sorta thing.  I'm kinda curious to see who else from highschool is a rough rider.  I've only heard about like 3 people comming out.

      I just read my horoscope today and it said:  "Don't even think about working today, you have no focus."  And man is it right.  I'm psyched I have an out now.  If they ask me to do something I'll just be like.  "Sorry can't, I got orders."      Whack! Smack! what was that? Darkwing Duck is on the attack. This is where you'll find him at. Fighting crime like a maniac.    Does anybody else remember that commercial?  My friend Tine and I in 8th grade had a little dance to that, it involved slapping, jumping, and some tush flailing.  We'd do it in school all the time.  FLAME OUT!

      I'm back.  Unfortunately.  I got my mattress yesterday and it rocks my boxers.  If any of you reading this are cute boys feel free to come over and check it out.  I went out to a bar around the corner last night with Spark.  After Buffy, he's like do you wanna check out neighborhood bars, and who am I to pass it up?  It was kinda fun, but kinda dead 'cause it was Tuesday and everything.    2 days 'til Olympic Fever!!!  It's a disease, I'm gonna print out a pretty schedule when I'm through with you brats.  Oh shit I think I found a lump in my luging ankle, the Olympic Fibrosis is already starting, stage two is Curler's Wrist, then the dreaded sequining of my clothes to be like Kwan.  I may just go get the bedazzler to make it easier.    BE LIKE KWAN!!! BE LIKE KWAN!!!

      I just got my delayed hangover, I almost booted in the bathroom before.  This sucks, I don't understand, I was doing so well this morning, wakin' up on time etc.  Damn!  It's like a Kevin Costner movie, you wait so long for it to come, and when it finally does you're pissed that you were born.    (I gotta give a shout out to my coworker for that one.  I came up with the analogy, but I was constipated on who would be a good actor to name so I asked Tim)    I think it's the six pack of Amstel and 4-5 glasses of red trying to tell me something.

      I forgot to mention, I think the funniest one liner last night was made by Pawn.    The Bud Light commercial was on where the girl was preparing the room for sex.  And she's shouting down to her husband that there's candles and satin sheets and finally Bud Light then he runs up while stripping and dives on the bed but slips out the window.  So we're all laughing 'cause it's pretty funny and Pawn was like "It's funny 'cause it's true."  I couldn't take it.    My best showing was probably in the car when we were talking about the show I dunno I think it's called Elimidate.  So Pawn was explaining the rules and he's like "so there's like a guy and 5 girls..."  and I'm like "oh, I've had that nightmare."  Timing was perfect.    Well I gotta go now.

      I am sated.    It only took me like 35 mins to get in today.  WOOHOO!!  And it only gets better, 'cause I had to walk to my car this morning.  But that in and of itself was great.  I live in a city now, and walking around at 8 in the morning people are everywhere.  It's wonderful.    I had a blast yesterday.  I went with my new roomate Spark to his friends' place.  It was just cool hanging with other gay dudes.  I was cracking up the whole time, they were really funny, and I was on as well.  Not to mention that the superty-bowl was awesome.  And the couple whos house it was loved football.  Which I found cool, I like well rounded asses... I mean homos.  Every time someone would come on screen we would shout out "hey look it's..." and then put some weird name in.  Which was really funny drunk.  The Rams coach was called everything from Wilfred Brimley to Dame Judi Dench to Marky Post to Rerun.  Add in some 'tight-end' humor and drooling over Tom Brady, it was a laugh riot.    We were talking about valentines day and if Spark should get his boy of 2 months a gift.  Pawn suggested that it not be too relationshippy.  I started cracking up 'cause I'm like "you should get him the pro-trim, and you can be like I saw how your eyes lit up when we watched that commercial."    Well all in all I am happy about the move.  I think I'm gonna go get my computer today and my mattress comes tomorrow.

      Happy friday!    I'm happy, and also in possession of certain keys to a certain apartment.  Woohoo!  Now I can go anytime I want, it's like I live there already... wait I paid rent, so I do live there.  Took some measurements last night, and it looks like the bed frame I want is OUT.  I'm upset, but I'll get over it.  I'm probably gonna have to do the bed in a corner thing to get the desk in there, and my sister was like "You don't want to close it off any more with a footboard, it'll make it look even smaller."  Fuck her for being right.  But it does save me like 4 large (is large thousand or hundred? I think it's thou, but I mean hun).  So now when I get board today at work I'm gonna cut out little shape for furniture and play puzzle with graph paper, or possibly go to target to look for plastic (I want to make this shower curtain out of 4"x8" plastic rounded rectangles that are connected with loops.  I'm thinking green with a strip of blue at the top, and one second from the bottom.  all in all it comes out to 8 rows of 18 columns.  It's like 144 pieces and 414 connections.  But I think it'll look kick-ass.  I think I'm gonna have to cut up folders or something, it's impossible to find sheets of plastic.).  Well be in good spirits, and have a blessed weekend. psha!

      This week has been insane at work.  It the end of year for us on Friday and I need to get all this stuff done.  But I still steal a minute or two to move over some more old posts.  If you notice to your left there are some posts archived by month.  Have fun.  Other than that.  Did you catch 24 last night.  I was IMing with some guy so I wasn't giving it my undivided attention, but it was good.  Well I hope that these posts pick up.  Where'd the funny go?  I guess beat out of me by work.  But Crew Class starts Monday, so that's cool.  I hope it's fun, and helps me keep in shape.  Late

      Hello all, I've been itching to get back into the Blog thing for a while.  It's been a 2 year vacation....  We'll get into that shit over the comming weeks.  I guess I should introduce me.  I'm a 24 yr. old gay guy in DC from New England.  I've been here for just under 3 years.  I love it and think I've found home.  So I'm thinking about moving all my old Diaryland posts over, but that's gonna take a while.  Some day maybe you can check them out.  (I was thinking about neglecting to move the self-important, or self-loathing, or otherwise embarrasing posts, but that's not real)  Also the template is under construction, and I don't really know my Blogger shit so it's gonna be handicapped for a while until I get into the swing, so bear with me.  Enjoy!

      Awesome, it's a four day week, then a four day weekend, then another four day week.  Wahoo!  I can't even think about working right now.  Blah blah, I'm so not into it.  I was laying in bed last night and I couldn't fall asleep, I thought these damned cicadas were only suppoesd to make noise during the day.  I guess that was a false.  Well I gotta get back to work.

      I was on the Connecticut Post's site, wondering about the recognition of Massachusettes' marriages in my home state.  The I came across the message board.  I was so angered by everybody's use of 'god' in defining civil law that I needed to respond.  This is what I said;   Let's not stop at denying same-sex couples the right to marry. Let's deny all people the right to marry under the law. If marriage is such a time honored religious institution then the government (state or federal) has no place to recognize it. Let's establish civil unions, blind to race, gender, etc. to establish stability in household and the rights and privileges guaranteed to present day married couples. Then the church can have its marriage; thus averting the apocalypse that so many people have been referring to. And the religious right can continue along its morally superior, discriminatory, path to save us all. Religion has no place dictating the lives and lawful actions of those in a society founded on the principle of religious freedom. That it is already ingrained in our everyday lives is not a sound argument for perpetuating it's presence. The only purpose it serves is to alienate those who do not believe in the Judeo-Christian establishment, thus infringing on their religious freedom. Government should be secularized and god should be removed from the public sphere.

      Hey guys.  I have had this  urlLink song  in my head for a few weeks.  listen and enjoy.  Things have been going cool here for a bit.  I finished my rowing class and met a lot of cool people.  I start for real in June.  Um, I'm almost finished transfering all my old posts.  only 100 left.

      So I get my LSAT scores back next week, and I've been all over this forum where people are talking about admissions etc. and mainly the LSAT.  On the site people have been recounting their testing experience and trying to remember any question they can.  Through this I think I have built a false hope that my score is good, since I always seem to get the answer ppl on the forum think is correct.  Which is cool, but now I'm nervous.  To top it off (and not in the good way) I have heard from numerous sources that they hod gotten their scores early.  This kinda frightens me since I was prepared for them showing up on the 6th.  Oh well, we'll see. Cross your fingers and hope for Travey.

      I'm finally home, well at work.  After a grueling weekend.  I'll lay it down for you.  Firday I do (almost) a full day of work.  And get a ride to the airport at about 8 (car).  This I hop on my 35 minute flight to Newark (plane; yeah I know, it was dumb, but flyi.com doesn't start flying to JFK till next month or something).  After taxiing and everything it took about 2 hours.  Then I hop on a shuttle to Grand Central Station (bus), the Jersey transit system , in their infinite wisdom, decided that only one lane was required for entrance into New York City.  So my 35 minute bus ride took 2 hours.  I get to the train station and look for the next train, well this was convenient, there was only one left.  I had missed the 11:22, and the 12:22 so it's the 1:30 for me.  I don't know if any of you have taken the 1:30 outta GCT, but unless you're intoxicated it's not fun.  It's like the drunk tank at county (does anyone know what county is?  Just sounded like somthing Perry Mason would say, or better yet, Matlock).  To top this off there was a Phish concert in NYC.  And if you know anything about me, you know I don't like Phish.  So me on a train with a bunch of drunk and high kids.  To top it off, the 1:30 makes EVERY stop through to Connecticut, so my 45 minute ride (train) took 2 hours.  Finally I roll into Trumbull at 3:30 and get to sleep.... 'till 9.  Saturday was nice, the wedding was pretty and stuff.  I really wasn't feeling the Catholic sercive, although who does. "Honor" this, and "serve" that, and "make him a cheese sammich woman."  The reception was cool, very Italian, but I ended up making friends with a cousin of mine that I haven't seen in like 8 to 10 years.  She's cool.  Danced like a fucking freak, caught holy hell for that the rest of the weekend.  But 'sall good, when the three of us (Todd, Traci and I) get together it's in good fun.  Went to bed at like 2... 'till 6.  Sunday was really cool.  Went to the U.S. Open, not really a golf fan, but the weather was incredible and it's just overall a cool experience.  Kinda bummed that Phil doubled the 17th, but ehh... there was some good golf played.  This is a conversation I had with my brother's fiancewhile whatching some guys put on the 16th green.  Meg: Where's the hole? Trav: Megan you gotta remember these thing, jeeze. Meg: Do you know where the hole is? Trav: I got a couple ideas.  We got outta there at like 7:45, crammed 4 people in the back of my sister's Pathfinder.  And started a horrible trip through long island.  4 hours later (and about 50 miles), we roll into Manhattan and drop off Todd and Megan.  Then we trade off and each drive a bit.  My shift came on at 1:30 and was the last leg.  I was so tired, being in the sun all day and all.  Finally roll in at about 3:30.  All in all, horrible trip, but some perspective; it still was shorter than my trip up there... and I flew.

      I took the LSAT monday.  The culmanation of a 2 week blitz study session.  I don't want to go out on a limb and predict my score, but I think that I'll be at least comfortable with it.  The testing environment was much better then Oct. '02 when I last took it.  This time I think I'm ready to make the plunge, hopefully I can get in to the schools I want though.  But I have 3 weeks to obsess about how I did, and you know me.  I've already established a Y! group to try to compile everyone's memory of the exam so we can see if we got questions correct.  So far I've gotten most of them right, but I'm not sure about this one about "Health Education" and Propaganda.  Anywho, that's all I got to say about that.  On another note I've been talking with this really kick guy on IM (but he know's about this site, so I won't go into detail about this...  if you want the skinny you can contact me ;) ).  Also I've been really blah at work, an I'm going to Connecticut this weekend.  I'm really hoping to slow down for a bit next week.

      So I was sitting on the john the other day and it was all rocking back and forth.  A few months ago the landlord changed our toliet 'cause it was leaking and causing problems int he apartment below.  Since then it has been a little less than stable.  So while I was using the facilities the other day I reached into my "5th" pocket on my jeans and pulled out a nickel and a penny.  I was able to shim the nickel in the from and the penny in the back.  Now it doesn't rock anymore.  Also I got my LSAT scores last week.  99th percentile... not bad.  Also, 6 days until I go on vacay to San Fran, I'm wicked excited.  PS.  I hope all y'all e-mailed your Senators this week.  I've been watching C-Span all week on the FMA debate.  Later

      So I found this site in a gay magazine.  urlLink ratemyschlong.com  I love it... added to the fact that there's some NICE dick on it. It's a great waste of time. I posted one of me... heheh... but it's pending.  My friend from CMU is comming to visit today. I'm psyched 'cause I haven't seen him on about 3 years and I've never seen him gay. Well I guess he was always gay, but I didn't know until last year. Oh yeah and he's super cute, but that's besides the point. I hope we have a lot of fun.  well have a blast on RMS, it's hella-addictive
