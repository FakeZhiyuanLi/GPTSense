      Wake up, french kiss her, good morning... Talk about all the things that are still longer to believe. Talk about the love, the truth, and how much she meant to me. The truth is, she's all that I need... All night I would sleep on the bed just to be closer to her...  Everyone is talking, talking about us, the love, the truth between us. I didn't care much, just need to be closer to her, so as to take a closer look at her...   Although the night is not long, I would be thinking about her. When I closed my eyes, I won't be alone because I'll be thinking about her. I've got nothing to prove to her about the truth, just as to tell her, how much I love her.  She didn't need to hear, when I said these words, "I can't sing a love song to you, I can't be romantic like the way it's meant to be. Guess I'm not that good anymore, just the way it meant to be."   If she told me to lie for her, to cry for her, I could. If she told me to die for her, I would. Just take a look at my face, I would pay anything... just to say these words to her, "I'll always love you... and I'll always be there for you... Love You, always"   Love, Alan

      Darkness falls... everything goes so quiet. I could hear the flame burning on my cigarette as I take a puff. Trying hard to capture the silent that I've long desire... The silent in my heart, the silent in my mind...  Silent became my precious, once... Only then, will I be able to hear voices, voices that I had long missed. Voices that only I could hear. The voices of my own prayers...  "beg of you, hear my prayers, let me go, help me... please help?".   Loneliness starts taking over my life & my prayers has become an obsession which I prayed every night. Don't know where to go, don't know what to do, mainly staring blankly at the wall... "What have i done to deserve this? Why me? Why do I have to face this alone? Why is everyone ignoring me?" questions came to my mind soon after.   Blank mind, it's so quiet.. so comfortable... so dark... so peaceful... reaching out but there is nothing out there... blank!  Walking alone to the kitchen room, turn my head, and there he is again... this time, he's different, he's staring at me with no smile, no laugh in his face. I walked up and looked closely into his eyes... cold is the word to use, so bloody cold... I starts to shiver for that moment from his look in his eyes... He started to reach out for me, so am i... we could barely touch our palm from the opposite side of the world. So real, its so real, I could barely touched him.  "help me, help me alan... alan, help me..." voices that i hear when i lay down on the bed staring at the ceiling wall. These voices that I hear, their so familiar... heard it somewhere, but I could not remember whose it belongs to... So familiar... so...

      "Why am I doing this to myself?" i asked myself in the mirror this morning when i woke up. There he is again, smiling at me with his wicked smile. I knew he's laughing at me inside. Laughing at me for my stupidity, laughing at me for not letting it go...  It's been awhile, since i could, hold my head up high. It's been awhile, since i could, feel my own heartbeat. It's been awhile, since I could, say I love myself. It's been awhile, since I could, been addicted to the man behind the mirror. "Just make these go away!" is the thought, when I'm alone with no one else. Everything I can't remember, everything seems like a dream. It's been awhile, since I'm sorry...  The concequences are deep... and I had no one else to blame but myself. I kinda fucked things up again and again. "why can't I just make all these go away? Why?"   "I will give in anything just to hear your voice, i will give in anything just to be with you..." these are the words that are crying in my heart. Tears starts to flow downwards onto my cheeks. I hold my head up high, praying to someone else, praying...  This is just the beginning, the beginning to my painful prayers...

      Everyday, I have to face him when i look into the mirror. The man is always looking at me, smiling and laughing at me.   "let me out...let it go..." voices that keep whispering to my ears when i see the man behind the mirror. I always sees him as my worst enemy that I had to face everyday. The man whom I do not want to see everyday. He is the man whom is not rational. Whom he loves pain, violent and cruelty. He is evil. He is crazy. He is barbarous. "is that who i really am? Is that really me? Who am i? Really, who am i?" these are my words that came out of my mouth when he's there, in the mirror. I do not know what I have become. I'm so tired at times... repeating myself every single day, reminding myself who i really am, fighting my will against his... But there he is! He's always there when I look into the mirror, staring at me, smiling at me... so evil, so merciless... the unforgettable smile, the unforgettable laughter, the unforgettable voices that i hear, that i see... Sometimes, I kinda enjoy how he feels, what he thinks and what he wants... Its beautiful! No worries, no pain, no mercy... simply evil.

      Since the day I met you, I can't forget your look, of what you said. I'm addicted, I'm so addicted to you.   When I see you down the streets, I can't pretend I don't know you, I can't pretend I do not care about you. I try, try not to think about the pain inside of me. But it's just too late and I'm ok, I just need to stay away.  Missing you, wonder why? When your near, my heart pumps harder, when your far, my heart hurts. You always seems so far away, and you don't seems you care anymore. I'm sorry, I can't always be there for you. I'm sorry, I can't be your perfect guy. I can't stand it anymore, and nothing seems alright anymore.   No turning back, walk away, I try, but it seems too late. Nothing going to change the things you said, nothing going to change the things you done, just walk away, no turning back. I just wanna make you proud, but there is nothing I can do anymore.  I need a hero to rescue me. Always thought you can be my hero to rescue me, although you can't be perfect but I always think you are perfect. But you always seems you don't care anymore, why?  Now, I've lost it all, I can't go back, nothing I can do anymore. I'm sorry, I try, I already try, I just need to talk to you but you don't seems you understand me anymore. I'm sorry, I'm just not a perfect guy. I'm just another guy who is standing behind the mirror, pretending to be a perfect guy, but it's just too late...

      It's not easy to be me... I'm not crazy, I'm just a little bit unwell. Just trying hard to be like everyone else around me. Had hard times when i looked into the mirror where i can't face myself no more...   Most times, when i looked into the mirror, i had to find the man behind it, wonder where he had gone, wonder how come he's not there anymore? In my place, where i couldn't change, i was lost... lost in my own fucking place.. I was scared, i was not under prepared, i couldn't find myself anymore... god damn it, i was so scared...  Saying please, saying please... screaming out loud, in my place, in my heart, in my mind, where have i gone to? where have i been to?   All day, staring at the ceiling... all night hearing voices telling me, i might want to get some sleep because tomorrow will be a better day! It's me, it's only me, talking to myself in public, people looking at me, people staring at me, wonder am i crazy or something. laughing to myself, smiling to myself, just to make myself feel easy...  Can't remembered what had happened. Everything seems fine before and it just happened... I'm so addicted, addicted to the man behind the mirror, can't forget his face, can't forget his smile, can't forget his laughter, can't forget him... He's so strong, so free... free of troubles, free from mortal... laughing, i'm laughing now.. don't know why, don't know what happen... just laughing...  Guess i'm just addicted...

      when sun falls... i will remember what you said, although its not in my head but still i can't sleep day after day... why cant we talk about it? there can be a better way... you doesn't make me want to stay... there is nothing left to say and i got my eyes shut, praying they will stay that way.. and when i stay strong, that's what makes the difference everyday...    you said that we been in love, but you always give me a reason, is that ok? may that be the last kiss, i will walk away... i will keep my eyes shut and we'll pretend not to know each other..   why don't we stay together? why can't we stay together? what is holding you up? always there is a reason for you not staying togther.. everytime i try to talk to you, i get so excited, everything i say to you, comes out wrong, never comes out right.. always there is a reason from you for not staying together.. always there is a reason from you for loving me..   if i could make you mine, i will go wherever you will go.. if i could, i would be with you, i will follow wherever you will go.. tat is if i could, i would do so... if i only could...

      Loneliness covers me throughout my life... i wonder why? I only ask for companion and concern, nothing more...   I look deep beneath my heart and soul, looking for an answer, a reason, a way out of this... I treat people as nice as i really could... i treat people with one heart and one soul, i help people and ask for nothing in return... but y am i still so lonely? what are the reasons?  Don't understand, really don't understand... why do i always have to be so lonely? am i destine to be this way? no matter how hard to try, no matter how hard i change, it seems nothing has changed.   People always say sorry, but nothing gonna change, saying sorry and expect nothing had happened, and arent gonna change their mistakes as well.. so what is the point of saying sorry when nothing can be done, when nothing can be changed or nothing is going to changed?  I try so hard to change myself, i really tried... people are greedy and ask for more.. so i give them more and they want more... i always try to satisfy them cos i know i needed a fren, a companion, who will give me abit of concern, who will standby me and lend me their listening ear... no one, no one could do that for me! why? don't understand, really confused.. what have i done to deserve this kinda treatment? what have i done to deserve this kinda loneliness?   Day after day, month after month, years after years... i have been waiting, waiting for a companion... now im getting very tired of waiting already... really tired of waiting... been so lonely for so many years... why do i felt so lonely? why do i have to wait for so long, so long?   Saddness....

      I never meant to be like this.. He is whom am i to be.. He is whom i had become.. He is whom suppose to be me... He is the man behind the mirror..  I lived in fear once. Fearing what will happen to me next.. fear of losing my meals, fear of being alone, fear of adults, fear of humans, questions starts to arise... the 'why' word starts appearing in my head...   Time flies, i learn to survive, learn to enjoy pain, learn to enjoy darkness, learn to enjoy the loneliness around me, learn to lie, learn to cheat... just to survive and i did..   As i grew up, i always wanted to change, change to be a better man and i did... tats why i never give up, never give up on people, i wanted give them hope, give them support that they need.. but why do they give up hope on me? 'stubborn' is the word they use on me because i stated my reasons and my points of view. Chance is what i need and i have been chasing after it. i change wat i can and i already did my best but people still don't give me chance when i fail once... they just give up on me... why?  Now, i begin to like the name 'Sin'. I wonder why? maybe it's because I am one. So i will start calling myself Sin and it seems i liked it alot.   I have been living in the darkness too long... now i'm starting to break loose.. what will i become next? why do i fear myself so much? what will happen next? i think only i can explain...
