      Man, just gotta tell you guys, this really sucks. I'm leaving for the summer to go visit my dad in Yellowknife, North-West Territories, in northern Canada. Since my parents are divorced, this is one of the only times I see him (that and Christmas vacation). Well, I'm leaving tomorrow, and I think I'm really gonna miss my girlfriend, we've been together for about a year but it seems like a lot more. We know almost everything about each other, we've gone so through so much. So I won't be seeing her for 2 months :(. Anyways, at least we'll spend the day together once she gets back from buying my birthday present (since she won't be there while it is my real birthday, she's giving me my present in advance). I know what it is cause I went shopping with her to get it. She's gonna get me some "board" shorts, some Vans sandals and some t-shirts. Really nice stuff, gonna make me think about her the whole time :(. Anyways, I'm happy cause I configured this thing that will allow me to download stuff on my computer here (in Montreal) with a computer with access to the Internet (where I'm going we have one at home). So when I get back, I'll have all the newest programs, music and games ready to be installed and burned :D. While talking about computers, I would like to mention that I want to upgrade and mod the shit out of my PC, gonna get a new PCU, probably get a AMD XP-M 2500+, some new harddrives, a different heatsink, etc. (haven't really sentled on anything yet). Oh, BTW, I'm leaving tomorrow to go visit my grand-parents (on my dad's side) in Winnipeg, I'll be there for a week and a half, I hope I'll have fun, cause my grand-parents are getting old. Also, we'll be going to Pilot Mound, this little farming community where my Dad's girlfriend comes from, it's a pretty cool community, we'll be going to their cottages and I'll probably have the chance to play golf, youpppppiiiiiiiiii. Anyways, I'll probably post when I get in Yellowknife.

      I got here late Sunday and boy was it light out. Over here the sun goes down at about 2am for maybe an hour and then it's light out again, pretty hard to sleep when it's really light out and your not used to it. Anyways, my birthday is coming up soon and I'm thinking of asking for and iPod or something like that. My family is having some problems now cause someone is f'ed up and won't admit it. During the week of my absence, I went to Winnipeg (where my grand-parents live) and then to Pilot Mound (my step-moms birthplace, it was the 100th of the town). Today I'll either stay at home or go job hunting, not too sure yet. Hope you guys have a fun summer, I think me and my dad might be repairing a little Suzuki Samurai in a couple of weeks.  See you guys later
