      USC has a large movie school and close connection to Hollywood, that's why there's a theatre here and they show movies on the cheap for aspiring Hollywood people to learn. There's even a George Lucas house here, where people learn how to make sfx.  Open the USC account statement and read what it says! Yeah, these American admin are slackers. Look how they gave me graduate housing! And screwed my budget over with a US$700 rent!  Seeya next week, bro. Remember to sneak in sneaker bars!

      USD$8? That's bleeding daylight robbery sia. would have thought that ,at the very least, the cinema going there to be cheaper. Why are they showing half-priced movies at a univ as prestigious as USC?  BTW: Just received a piece of air mail all the way from USC. Says uf account statement is enclosed and should be opened right away. Aren't you living on campus? Isn't it just a little arsinine to sent a letter halfway around the world here, just so i could tell you, who's right beneath their noses, that we've recieved it, via the internet? Cow sense ppl...just a little cow sense pls, if common sense is too much to expect these days...  Have to book in in a mere 2hr40min time... Not enough time in-camp to read their outdated newspapers (since the SGTs get first dips) to see if there're any offers for PCs or broadband connections. I suspect there would be. There always are.  Prisoner of circumstances, signing out for the week. XP

      Ah no lah, I borrowed from a friend here. No money how to buy? You have no idea how tight my budget is now. That's why I will wait until The Last Samurai plays in the university theatre here which is a month later but it'll only cost me US$4. Public theatres will be US$8. Do you know that the cinemas here do not assign seats? Its all first come first served.  Keep a lookout for letters, I'm expecting a cheque from Google soon and a cheque from CafePress in the near future.  Are there any desktops or broadband promotions lately?

      WOW.   What an incredibly beautifully shot film. You just get swept away by the lush scenery and the actors. Ken watanabe is simply THE best, and i find his final scenes with Cruise incredibly emotional and haunting. Not to mention, the female lead's transition of feelings towards Cruise is wonderfully sublime, and never feels forced.  Also, i liked that they've portrayed ninjas as the unfeeling, oppurtunistic assasins that they are. One literally feels a chill down their spine when they enter the scene.  "Samurai" means "service"! Let's us all go the Bushido way! YEAH!!!

      You lucky recruits. Cream is luxury man. Those sticks were like crayons.  About your National Skin Centre appointment, show them your 11B so that you don't have to pay for the fees and SAF will be billed. Best to call them beforehand, to check how it can be done. Maybe you need to bring your referral letter from the polyclinic to your Tekong MO for him to issue you a SAF referral to enjoy free medical attention?  Told you so many times, swimming test damn important! Dun listen, I thought frog style is damn easy? Nevermind lah, take is as free swimming lessons then.  You can buy conditioner and sunscreen from 7-11 mah. Also, you should just go to Tekong earlier than usual one day before book-in timing and then you go to the E-mart and use the credits on your 11B to buy the things you need. Why go all the way to Army market and waste cash?  My OC was CPT James, Kilo Company. By now he should be Major at least liao. Dun think its the same person, we were his last batch at BMT. Unless he kena demotion! You in Whiskey company? Back in my days Whiskey was a white-horse company. Super slack and got luxury treatment, like go outfield take bus one.  I'm trying to jog... but I can only do at most 2 rounds before I freeze to death.  Better start thinking about your career path, your choice of study in University is the start of your job life. Go through the   urlLink NUS  and  urlLink NTU  website carefully and look through their faculty, degree programs, etc. I should think you are thinking of NUS Life Science vs NTU Mass Communications?  Had that CNY dinner with the Singapore Student Association last night at some crappy restaurant. Cost me US$20! That's the most I ever paid for a meal here! And no shark fin! No suckling pig! No yusheng!   I'm eating raw broccoli as I type. Taken a liking to raw veggies! Romaine lettuce and purple cabbage in the fridge! And a large can of mayo to dip them in! Yummy!

      Do note:                No more camo sticks, they give you the cream now!               I have an appointment with N'tl Skin centre in Feb for my ecezma as well as that thing on my face.                Failed my swim cat test cos' i don't have a bloody clue how to swim breaststroke.                Now CNY, how to buy stuff like conditioner or sunscreen? furthermore, while i was on ATT C, they went on E-mart break, so i need to make a trip down to army market. And then i also need to call cmpb to see if thy can reissue my PES slip cos' i can't find it anywhere and the OC needs it.                Hey, Pa mentioned that he sorta remembered your OC was also a James. Was it LTA James Lim of Whiskey company by any chance?                You ah! Don't eat so much drumsticks ar!!! Later come back fatter when when you left for US. Exercise, It somehow seems to curb my appetite whenever i feel peckish.                 Heh. Took a E-mote test on career choices for fun. Says i have tendecies towards a path in Writing and Journalism.                 Read in the ST that the YJC principal is letting the students choose whatever subject combi they want, all 400 different combinations. Damn wise decision on her part, if you ask me.                 Might not be able to call you when i go back to mum's place on Sunday, last minute change of plans caused a Friday visit to my form teacher's house to be postponed to Sunday, 2pm. Mum also said they'll return to S'pore around late afternoon too.  Take care, and eat more veggies!!!

      Hey if you're out so long, how come you didn't call me when you're at mum's place?   Anyway, ATT C is t3h r0x0r! Yeah I was horribly tanned and burnt too. If you bother, you can buy aloe vera gel from any pharmacy and the burns heal really quickly. And you can also buy a Nivea sunscreen which is sprayed on if you want. Your scalp is coming out in flakes because its too dry! Same thing happened to me here because of the dryness, just use Dove conditinoner to moisturize your scalp you should be fine. Remember to tell the MO that you have severe ezcema and you get unberably itchy when you sweat and touch the grass, until one of them send you to see a specialist!   Yeah, BMT is not supposed to be slack, they have so much syllabus to cover that everything's usually a rush and since you do so much in a day the week seems super long. Everybody always hates the PTIs most, I think its tradition. They must have trained them to be hated at PTI school. The funny thing is, back in my days there was  also  a Australian-trained Indian in my section which everybody hated because he was an irritating jerk and lied to the CO that his mum was sick so that he could book out earlier. Oh well, in the army you meet all sorts, you learn tolerance for dickheads. Live and let live I guess.  A real fridge is cool because I'm addicted to cooking (for sheer survival. A plate of chicken rice here costs US$5 which is the cheapest I can find, while I can buy 12 raw chicken drumsticks for US$3) and I think I tend to overstock the fridge with pre-cooked food in lunchboxes because I cook in batches.  Since its university housing, it'll be illegal to just lease space out to a roommate and besides, I don't know anybody who hasn't have a place to stay now this late into the semester. I'm trying to find jobs around campus, which has been unsuccessful thus far. There's something here called "work study" for the local students meaning you can work off your study loan on campus so these people usually get employed because they don't get paid in cash.   Remember to get those zip-lock bags reinforced with tape at the edges! And ensure your torchlight doesn't eat batteries too fast! Buy LOADS of snake powder! Bring a small towel you can wet to wash your face! And bring the camo cream! All this is for your field camp! Oh remember to shit before you go, believe me you wouldn't wanna frequent the shit-hole too many times.  And try to call me when you're at mum's place!

      WEEEEEEE~~~~!!!   Out for the CNY for the 2nd day now, will have to book in in 4 more days time on Sunday.  Actually got to book out 2 days earlier on an ATT C ue to feveer, but then had to go back for 1 more day before they let us out.  Got out and realised i'd actually gotten rather tanned, and the sunburnt skin on my back is peeling off vivaciously, revealing large, white, moon-craterish patches of skin. Hair's actually long enough now that you can't see my scalp, which has also been peeling off of late, making it seem as though i've dandruff... So peels are so large i can see where there was hair growing out of it. Coolness...  Argh. Dreading the return on Sunday...They've already forewarned us that training will be picking up. All's been kinda slack till now, only thing that irritates the whole company is the PTI. Section wise, only got one fella that's being shunned and he's an Australian-educated Indian and as expected, a corn-ass as well as a troublemaker. Wonder how the Australian army survives with recuits like him.

I only bought 2 things there, since I think it'll be the only touristy place I'll be going so I got you and suanboi souvenirs. I think you liked the movie pretty much so I got you a  urlLink Back to the Future  toy car! And for suanboi a wolverine mug.

These 3 look quite official as they used pre-paid postage envelopes.  UPDATE: Got 1 new mail for you today, air mail all the way from Shinjuku, Japan. Also, i've received my POD bill today, no signs of yours or ur fren's yet though. Seems they're billing me 2 mths at a go now. The mysterious ways of SingTel's billing system appears to be set to remain as that till a slip of the tongue by Abel.

      I only used my handphone like 2,3 times (I was lost in Los Angeles, had to get directions back) and they charged me $30?! Excuse me while I faint. (I just used it again too because I had to call a group member who only has a cell phone, here you can't call cell phones from residential lines.)  Now I really need that Google check sent to me.  Yeah blisters are SAF's free gifts to you. I wore double layer socks last time, I don't know whether that's wise or not. But tighter boots gave me less blisters.  How come you never reply to the SMSes I sent you? I asked if your medical check-up went okay. Hope all is well.  Bookouts will never be long enough. But think of all the money you're saving in there. For people like us who are less well-to-do, the money you save up during your NS years will really see you far in life. Mum was just telling me the other day how lucky we all are that she is facing financial difficulties now in a time when both of us are financially independent.  Oh, I won 2nd place (intermediate category) in a Big2 (Dai Dee) tournanment last Thursday. =)  Keep your spirits up, don't let SAF pull you down!

      Just returned from Sitest week, legs are all worn out... Must have walked the parameter of Pulau Tekong over the 2 days seeing that each detail walked a minimum of 8 hours on each day. OC even made us have to walk back to SISPEC to take the tonner back cos' "you all like to drag your boots so much right!!!" Worse, I book out for less than 22 hours cos' i have to go back at 1325 for RT! Blisters on my toes and heels haven't even begun to subside yet...  Meanwhile, in a Galaxy far, far away...  Your Google check adds to your coffers a whooping $72.79!!! Also, your POD bill shows that for using your HP on the 12th & 11th of Jan as well as the subcription fee for Mar, the grand total to be paid this month is $40.24!!! Hooray!!!  In mail news, there's another letter for you from USC...yet another account statement. Also, 1 piece of mail each from Safra, Pioneer newsletter and POSB detailing your bank transactions probably.  Back to our hero...  Saw Lost in Translation last week. Noticed quite a bit of off-focus camerawork, guessing that was intentional given the story. Quietly funny, but rather meandering to the point that there wasn't actually any actual focal point in the movie: just 2 displaced people, removed from their usual comfort zones, reaching out for each other in search of home, i guess... Think i'll try to watch Cold Mountain later, if time permits...  Book outs are too short, 5 weeks has since gone. Would like to stay home more, but here's me signing off.

      All the letters, as long as they don't look like personal love letters, you can open them. You'll need to send me the checks because I'll have to cash them in at a local bank here. If you deposit it into my Singapore bank, the exchange rate fees and the commission would kill half the cheque's value.  Just put it in an envelope, weigh it at the S.A.M machine in the MRT station, click the destination (North America, USA) and it will tell you how much postage you need to put on it. It should cost around S$1. And yeah, usually this is air mail. I don't even think they do sea mail for letters anymore...  Hey, by the way, is there anything you want me to get here for you?

      Wow, that really sounds like you did have a good time. You're right, there's beauty out there if we just bother to look for it. I'm really proud of how mature you are being so positive about filed camp. Where many people others would complain and moan about how shitty it is or fake some illness just to go back to the bunks, I know you saw the point. Life is life and it's always both good and bad, I'm glad you didn't focus on the bad parts and made an effort to find the good stuff.  That was exactly what I thought when I was in field camp, it was so beautiful out there, and the stars were amazing because there was no street lamps in the jungle. I miss camping, I'm planning to camp in Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Redwood, Death Valley and Oceanu Dunes after the semester on a roadtrip. Over here on a clear cloudless night, the sky is blue instead of black and you can see plenty of stars. And the one most instantly recognized is of course Orion, all of it.  Happy Valentine's Day bro! Love ya!

      Field camp was long, but okay. 2 whole paltoons were stuck with just menu 3, but i desperately wanted to try menu 4. Instead of 2 4k  ET runs, we had one and another that was just 1 k long, and it led to where our OC had arranged for us to view the sunrise! Discipline was stricter than normal for my platoon (thanks to saintly 2LT Azahar), but was nightmarish for the rest. Hardest part were the freezing night wind and the route marches, but damn they were worth. Had some CS urban gunfight fun during the fifth day, Some dazzling scenery we have on Tekong, especially in that Savannah-like landscape we had for our last camp site. Digging the sandscript was hell, but sleeping in it was strangely comforting. The nightsky there WAS SIMPLY INCREDIBLE!!! Never knew one could see so many stars in S'pore. Was able to see the whole Orion constellation i think, and even see the movement of stars in between moments of waking. AS IF THAT WAS ENOUGH, a privileged few of us saw a GORGEOUS solitary shooting star that lasted more than a full second and was brighter than all the planets that night.  Phew.

      I'll settle the USC payment here. Thanks. And pass IPPT and SOC as soon as you can so you don't have to go through it again and again and again. They are both all about running and running, especially SOC. Obstacles are easy, just have to keep running with all that weight.  P2P telephony was very "dirty". Lines were fuzzy. This new one is a breakthrough in the sense that it has achived a line clarity better than phonelines. Something free that is better than something paid. And guess who made Skype? The same people who brought you kazaa.  Lost in Translation is, about being lost in life (and Japan) but more than anything its about one of those relationships we have with people. Pity if you can't watch it, very little nudity. (And I don't think anybody should ever stop "finding themselves". But yeah, you think about your life a lot more when you're halfway around the planet.)  Hmm, maybe material for some future story arcs. I'll probably incorporate a student-exchange phase. The fill-in strips are left with 2 more, after that... Wei Da and I take over again. I have scripted and storyboarded almost everything to last until August at least. And thanks to broadband, we can work together over the net.   CMPB sucks. Some things never change. Hope things work out for you.  Field camp. Ahh... still one of the most memorable events of my life. Remember about checking your torch and making sure it can last. Eat combat rations, they will not make you shit so often and you dun need to go to the shithole that much. The shithole is pretty much the worst part. Tape your zip lock bags! Realli important! Ration your no.4s and socks so that you always have one dry (sacred) set to sleep in. Bring loads of powder. Sling your rifle and sleep with it. Adjust your body in the crevices of the ground to get a good night's sleep. Behave so that you don't get punished to do guard duty. Don't lose any part of your weapon, especially the bayonet be careful that it doesn't slip out. If it rains, use the time to cook maggi mee. Treasure the experience, its truly unique. Remember to be careful with your glasses, if it breaks you'll be lost in the jungle.   Take care!

      "the Maroons" have their song "Harder to breathe" for quite a while on S'pore radio now. You should try listening to another band, me thinks they were called "White Stokes". Not so sure on the Stokes part of their name.  I'm quite suprised you didn't know abt the internet P2P telephony, considering you buy PC Magazine. Was pretty hyped abt a year or 2 ago.  American movie-making (studio of course, not indie) is getting so formulaic, they have to bring in Asian directors, who end up getting stifled by the deep-seated American framework they're supposed to reinvent. Don't think "Lost in Translation" has reached our shores yet. Still waiting to see the Butterfly Effect.  Is "Lost in Translaton" about Bill Murray in Japan or something? Is the R(A) age requirement in S'pore 18 or 21?   So, have YOU found yourself, halfway around the world? Me dun have any recollection of 'Tokyo Biyori' though...  When you come back, maybe you should do a little side-plot for Slackers before getting back into the grind of the storyline, something like "Yuxman and Rent-a-Zilla: Lost in Cali"  Hate CMPB. Called them on Friday last at 1pm, expectig them to be on a full working day. No answer. Figured they weren't open for CNY. Tried my luck the next day at 12:15. Call answered. Told me to come down before 1pm, and no, they weren't open on Sunday. Now, i only get out on weekends, and not before 12pm on Saturdays. At least i've 1 final gambit this Monday as I'm going in that night owing to Hari Raya Haji.

      First I must say either NUS or NTU, both would be good choices but it would be easier to get into NTU Life Science than NUS. And it is true that the average starting pay for NTU graduates are historically higher than NUS graduates, maybe because employees take into account any practical experience NTU student has as most of them are required to do industrial attachment where they work for a real company. You can also do a minor in Communications Studies in NTU I think, even with Life Science as your major.  USP ( urlLink An Introduction And An Invitation, University Scholars Programme ), I must warn you, is very rigourous and very demanding. It's very academic and would consume a lot of your time. But it's very interesting. Personally, I think I may not finish the entire USP myself because it's a little too much for me after the 1st tier modules. But I don't regret the time I invested in it, its been very enlightening. While I may not  complete  the programme (in fact, most don't. it has a very high drop-out rate), I am proud to say that I have participated in it.  Personally, I also think that NUS is a strangely more prestigious, even though this is probably not true. But at the end of the day, choosing NUS or NTU is not important. Being  sure  that you wanna do Life Science instead of other courses/life-paths is really the decision you should think about. If you're really sure you wanna do Life Science, then getting into either NUS or NTU would be the same. My guess is that it would be more popular for your batch and competition may be tougher.  Life Science would be a professional degree, that makes you a expert in something. Communication Studies (and also Bizad) for that matter is just a general degree, it doesn't make anybody an expert. Two very different schools of learning, one is very technical and academic, the other is more like "we show you the way, you make your own road". This is the main reason why I choose Bizad, I don't like mugging technical stuff, doing a general degree lets me stand out from the crowd because of how different and creative I am, not how good I can remember procedures in my area of expertise.  Funny thing is, I was thinking I would be happy with a job in advertising when I graduate. Very low pay but, to me it would be very fun. =) I am sure I wanna be in business, be in marketing (my major). That's the most important decision I made when I was at your age at the crossroads you are at now. I don't regret it. And that's how you must always make life decisions, make sure you will never regret it. Or stubbornly refuse to.  Cheers to a decision in the morning!

      THAT THIZ IZ DA SHITZ, MAND!!!  urlLink The Attack of the Giant Red Octopus   Anyway, i've taken a look at both the NUS and NTU life sciences curriculum and i'd have to say they're pretty much on par (with slightly different subjects here and there as well as slightly differing emphasis). In my opinion, it seems that NUS has a more flexible structure, with electives available by the 3rd year (and NUS has USP!), whereas NTU is more practical with 4th year modules like Entrepeuneurship and Managerial skills (and is a direct honours course).  What to do? Must register by the end of today (is the 31st, early morning) and still no clear winner... NTU seems to be the stronger choice (heard from bunkmate, said he read in paper that NTU grads better paid), but NUS holds a certain amount of appeal towards me. Do wonder now, considering the jam-packed semesters, if i could manage a life science course with the USP curriculum...  Anywho, was also taking a look at the communications and information school at NTU, they got majors in journalism and publishing, public and promotional communication, broadcasting and communication research. The intake there is only 180, so quite hard to get in, and the more i think, the more evil advertising appears, especially since lately many bad commercials have been reappearing on TV.  Guess i'll have to sleep on it and make a decision when i wake.... or maybe take Bizad! HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAAH!!!!!!!

      Previously, on Army life:  As expected, this was a rather slack week for us, being 1 week away from POP and all. Major events were, in this order, IPPT on Tuesday (didn't have to do as i'd gotten silver the last time round and would have to reduce my 2.4 by 1min12sec in order to meet Gold timing); SOC on Wednesday (did it in 9:39); POP Grad rehearsal on Thursday and lastly Games day on Friday (also our book out day). Guess what? Pulau Tekong got "invaded" by 3 armed robbers from Malaysia, with loot amounting to a grand total of RM10,000!! This happened on Thursaday afternoon, and the whole of BMTC was thrown into a state of panic and confusion, with neither recruits or instructors really knowing what was going on exactly; but all knew something big was happening As a result, we were all immediately ordered to send arms (a sorta rumour surfaced, saying someone probably lost their arms or something) and made to sit on the track in anticipation of more informed instructions. Hence, later it was announced that all activities would be suspended, including the rehearsal, and to strictly adhere to the bubby system, report and stop all suspicious persons and guard duty personnel were posted as well. The next day, Games Day went ahead as scheduled, in which i was part of the design theme that made 3 impressive banners with running "W" motifs, a mascot costume, made of used cans, partially-resembling a Whiskey bottle as well as a wire-frame "W" that was put on the admin tentage (the project i supervised over!). however, i'd missed some of the proceedings as quite a bit of us had to go over to N coy's lecture room for a SAFPU interview. Initially, i was quite hyped at the idea of being an MP (OCS and SISPEC given priority before their 12 week MP BMT, min. IPPT pass, no SOC, a 1-nite field camp, thier similarities to the police force[ having a CID-esque special investigatopns branch, an anti-riot branch, etc] and only 30% being selected to return to do reservist!) However, while being interviewed by the MP sergeant major, i was made to realise, painfully, what bastards MPs have to be in order to perform their duties and it made me regret that i had expressed interest in becoming a MP. Anyways, remember a few paragraphs back i mentioned Friday as bookout day? Well, that wasn't the case for 80% of my section as well as several others from platoon 2 who were confined. In my section's case, they were confined as they had sand-papered their barrels to a glittering, silvery shine. Me? I had to sign 1 extra in the 1st week as i had signed in the wrong box during send arms and i had to clear it in the 9th week by being confined and doing guard duty against those robbers. By luck of the dice, while my partner and i were about to start our shift, one of the robbers had een caught, thus all guard duties from then were cancelled (though the damage of confinement had been done) : total time between draw arms and send arms= 5 mins.  Now, some words from our editor:  The devil lies sleeping within the details:spill the beans! Whatcha do in Vegas? Blow a fortune? Bungee off Hoover dam?? Get married to Britney in a publicity stunt to promote slackers???  Now, back to the Home channel:  So, some letters came in for you. Heh, so what's new? The one from USC says you own them $1,433. Another came from Heineken music. Another came from cafepress.com.  BTW: Our aged hamster is looking upon us from nigh on high in hamster heaven now. From my estimates, he passed away peacefully in his sleep this early Sunday morning between the hours of 1am to 7am. He is survived by his adopted family of a geeky brother, a prodigal son and not to mention a workaholic father. His wake is over, so forget about attending it. His corpse has been placed, with the utmost respect, in a black plastic bag packed with wood shavings, that was placed in several other layers of plastic bags with more wood shavings and is scheduled for fire burial at the local incinerator.  Ashes to ashes, Dust to dust. May his eternal soul live on, With His light and grace in the Silver City. RIP

      Marching in the rain... ah... the memories. =)   Don't worry about your A level results, it's in the past now no point having regrets. That's one thing you must train yourself to do, for better or worse, stubbornly refuse to regret. I think your grades are excellent and regardless of what "may have been", you can be proud of "what is".  I just came back from Las Vegas and Hoover Dam. Had a great time!   I'm proud that in the army where it is almost excusable to think that everybody can be selfish, you didn't subscribe to that lowest common denominator and stay true to the person you are, regardless of circumstance.  Answer to your question: You apply for USP after getting into NUS. Much later I think, I applied less than a year before my NUS term started. Life Science or Mass Com, those are both good choices. Choose the one you can see yourself working in for a lifetime.  Block leave would be an oasis in the desert which is army life. Have fun! =)

      Pretty horrible rainy weather for a 16k route march and range week. On the very first day itself (route march day), it began to rain as we started on our warm-up, marched away from the rain and were greeted by the rain as we returned. Must have stored at least 200ml of rainwater in each boot, demonstrating the waterproofiness of the SAF combat boots. Range in the rain wasn't all that bad though, and it was fine, up till the point a greenhorn officer zeroed my beloved M16 and broke the zeroing disc! So i had to get a spare arms, which was shooting so off centre that during the manual caqnadian bull target, only 2 shoots landed on the board! My instructor had to click all the way to the right and it was STILL hitting slightly left. Thus, i failed my first day's shoot (due to all the zeroing that had to be done) but failed to get marksman by 3 pts on the second day (13 on the 1st, 23 on the second). Another thing that the rain made worse was the grenade assualt course. My goodness, most people were practically wading their way through. At least we only had to do it once. Got to book out on Friday nite due to the OCS visit on Sat, an event i regretably missed due to oversleeping and the inability to set the alarm before i dozed off. But then again, i WAS feeling sick from all that rain, so i went to the polyclinic to get an MC.  Getting ABBC is ok i guess, but feel miserable about not getting a single A in any of my triple sciences. And when you see so many around you getting 3 or 4 As, you definitely feel worse. So many things i could blame not geeting a better result on (taking 4 As in order to replace my MT score[not applicable anymore!], down with high fever for a total of 12 days before my exams, blahX3), but i guess everything just leads back to me. Kinda disappointed some of my tutors, esp. Mr Salahuddin of Biology.  Glad to hear you're having fun in the States, starting to seem as though you're there on a long protracted holiday. Just dun come back with an American accent, ja. Selfishness in Singaporeans was made very apparent during the range when an instructor yelled at us cos' some ppl just couldn't be bothered when he sent a rec to get 2 pincers from the rest at the admin area, and also when after i myself lend somebody my earplugs (and didn't get back i time), i had to approach no less than 5 ppl before someone was willing to part with his earplugs). Another reason why i wanna get into OCS is that i hope i don't have to see this type of behaviour again.  BTW, if i wish to get into the USP, do i do it as i apply for admission into NUS, or after i've been admitted and have finished NS? Saw the ad for the NTU Life Science school. Looks pretty impressive and they offer scholarships for those who complete their undergrad and are moving on to grad studies. Have yet to see anything on the NUS side though. Also, am considering mass comm as an option? maybe i'll go onto the NUS/NTU websites later, cos' right now, i'm all set to go at some BF.  Hmm...i smell block leave coming soon, MY

      So my roommates are the craziest bunch ever. Wild crazy party animals. I'm having a really great time here with them! America is great. Everything is so easy (I'm getting ridiculous grades without working hard) here and people are nice and friendly. I realized that Asians are horribly selfish, too self-centered but appear to put the group before self. American are the opposite, they are outlandishly individualistic, but really work well in a team.  Spring break just begun!   Let's invest in making our room (and the entire flat) looking good when I get back, and that includes upgrading the computer, maybe getting a new monitor, etc. I'm moving back, so I can spend more time with dad before he goes nuts.  Tell dad I read his letter and that I'm fine here. Tell him also to take care of himself.  Tai Dee competition, it was a real in-life thing, not a computer game. I won a big food hamper. :)  I bet you're looking forward to POP! =) Heh! If you really wanna go to OCS, I wish you best of luck. The only downside I can think of is that officers must do reservist until age 50, 10 more years than us normal folks. But Wee Kiat is an officer and he says the training is not as tough as SISPEC, so if you are going to do tough training anyway, why not OCS. So good luck! Maybe I'll get the chance to go to your OCS graduation!  Congrats again on your fine A level results. As for your choices, I must warn you that all I hear about Life Science/Biology is that it's extremely hard. And my friend in NUS Life Science says the degree only qualifies one to wash test-tubes. I think he means to go further in this field you'll need to do graduate studies, phd. You're right about NUS being more prestigious than NTU, but if you plan to work locally there's no difference. I suspect that NTU's life science program is better, and more practical as you say. And you should know that for no good reason, it's always harder to get into NUS than NTU, god knows why. Research more on your choices. Most important is thinking about your career, this degree will have to see you through in life. Don't do anything you won't be happy with or won't be good at.   NUS or NTU, don't fret too much. Really there's very little distinction between the two eventually when you graduate. Focus more on that life career choice. But whatever you may do, I'm sure our (overly) excellent education system will take care of you. =)   Cheers, bro! Take it easy!

      Heyloz, Finally can get online after 2 weeks!  So, i received my A results this week and got an A for Math C, 2 Bs for chem and Phy and a miserable C for Bio as well as an ok B3 for GP. AAB sounds so much better than ABB...  Was looking at the scholarship booklet. Thinking that only one that might suit me is the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star), but then i'm not so sure that i'll even make through the shortlisting, if i want the scholarship or put up with the interviewing and stuff at all.  Right now, am wondering to enrol in NUS or NTU. Prestige vs skills set. Will go about researching the course offered at both later, just have to meet the 1 April dateline. Most likely will go for the life sciences course, and seeing as the one at NUS began only recently, seems as though NTU is winning out with their new facilities. Still would like to be involved with animals or the environment, but i guess being involved doesn't mean you have to make it your career. On thing that i would regret if i did enrol at NTU would be missing out on the USP at NUS.  Haiz, so many of my friends all considering of studying overseas (mostly in Australia). There's even 1 guy in my section applying to study Economics at Princeton. How i envy you!! Just send one of my friends off (a Nepalese) at Changi who was going off to study in Perth.  Anywho, how's life on the far side of the world? Sad to say, you've already been there for half of your semester. Planning to defy the great American powers that be and become an illegal overstayer yet? Heh. Don't answer that...blog walls have ears too, you know...  Hoping to be able to get into OCS... sick of being just a specialist... I think i did fairly well at the sitest, maybe somewhere in the top 20 of the peer appraisal, got silver for IPPT(after failing for the first and getting a pass) and got 10:05 for my SOC! (pretty good, being my first full rundown as i missed the last 4 lessons)  Btw, im sending an email on dad's behalf to your account at minggeng@yahoo.com.  Take care, Work hard, Play harder.

      Telecommunications are t3h 3vil... especially in the US, whose telecoms are still neolithic compared to ours (goodness, they only started getting into SMS last year, don't have inter-operator compatibility AND can't call mobiles from residential lines!!?)  The minor surgery was ok, took all of 20 mins. Most of the time i was waiting outside, either to be registered. called or for the local anaesthesia to take effect. The injections weren't that painless, and during the final minutes of the procedure, i could actually feel the electro-shaver thingamajig cutting through my flesh like a laser. The doc said he would have to cut it out in a scooping manner, so there'll be depressions, but these would heal up after the scabs form.  Because of this, as well as for an injured, blackened toe, what was to be my siong-est week became my most slack as i was given 4 days of EX footwear by the MO; ie missing 3 out of 4 SOC, 2 out of 3 BCCT and both Swim, one of which was supposed to be the swim test for divers. Kinda fun sitting in the coy office, waiting for sai kan to occur. Kinda like a behind the scenes look at the BMT coy instructors' life. The pace of life was also wonderfully slow and relaxed.  Next week, we'll be having range. Got another appt with NSC on Thursday as a checkup as well as to see the histology results. Then on Friday, it's A level results day! Lately, there've been loads of changes to the education system announced by MOE; no more school rankings, changes to the tertiary level calendar so now there will only be one intake for JCs, scapping of SAT and MT becoming optional for Uni admission.  Glad i didn't send the cheque last week, or it would have been lost on arrival. So what's your roommate like?  What did you win in the dai dee tournament? Or was it just an online for fun thing? Must destroy this lousy monitor one day with my bare fists...>:X  Three more weeks to POP!

      I think you'll get a better deal in Sim Lim. Funan is more touristy.  Our PC is not that bad, in fact I take pride in it because I built it myself! Every single part carefully chosen. But by today's standards it is indeed a dinosaur. I guess we can just change the monitor and graphics card for now. I'll install Windows XP on it when I get back. (Which is 14th May.) And maybe do a harddisk reformat, because it's too cluttered with bad disk clusters. That'll free up space.  Don't you get the option to use Gmail when you log into blogger? You should!

      Would Funan be a better place to hunt monitors in?   And should we consider changing the PC's OS?  Is our PC really that bad? Sure, there are moments of laginess, but I still have a pretty enjoyable time playing icewind dale 2 (released 2002) and Temple of Elemental Evil (released 2003). I mean, i was quite shocked to notice our CPU had a 1.2GHz processor! That seems kinda fast, by my standards at least. But the undeniable fact is that we are running out of space on the harddrive though (about 9++gigs left). And i starting to fall in love with this HP keyboard even as i sit down in the mess typing out this blog...damn it feels good...  AND THE MONITOR MUST DIE. OFF WITH ITS TRANSISTORS~!!!!

      And $170 is $85 each way and it's pretty much affordable. So we decided to upgrade parts rather than buy a new PC altogether? I think our CPU is very outdated and our graphics card can barely make it. And we need to add another stick of RAM. I guess all in all that will still be cheaper than buying a new setup from Dell.  You look at the store you got that price from and go directly to it, hopefully it's not one of those obnoxious ones. But if you are a genuine buyer with cash, they usually treat you better. Stick to the price you saw.  Sim Lim is walkable from Bugis MRT Station, you walk in the direction of Fu Lu Shou Complex, Sim Lim is right at the end of that street.  urlLink Here's the map - Streetdirectory.com

      So... how about getting one of the samsung CRT monitors? the $170 range seems affordable and i think samsung would be the go-to brand in this aspect.  But is buying anything in Sim Lim Square that simple and straightforward?  Sim Lim is reachable from what mrt station?

      Does $285 sound reasonable for a first-hand flatscreen monitor? If it is, i'll go buy it next week cos' the screen on this monitor is seriously blacking out every 5-10 minutes...

         I hear ya moi brudder. Once I get back we'll talk about upgrading our PC and share the cost. Think about whether you wanna upgrade the graphics card, memory and cpu and buy a new monitor... or do we wanna get an entire new PC. If we do, we can get one from Dell and pay monthly installments. (I think I got that acer monitor in 1996.)  Yeah being platoon ic means being a giant walkin' talkin' target board. But keep your cool, don't let things bother you so much. In 2, 3 years time when you are in my shoes, millions of miles away from SAF and in university... you'll see that "it doesn't matter!"   I watched Kill Bill 2 as it opened here. It was a "raging rampage". Heh. Actually it was very different from vol. 1 and I liked it a lot. Its very poetic.  Oh no, you've degenerated into the needy ns-boy! (I want I want me me me!) Actually I just talked to mum and you are actually the richest fella now among us, drawing an allowance and all.   I'm gonna get FFXI so that we can play at home. It'll be sweet.

      I totally cannot stand the g**d***m*****f******g monitor anymore!!! Not only does it black out more often now, it seems to have taken on a permanent pink hue that i can't get rid of! Can't play Icewind Dale 2 to the fullest like this and it bleeding hurts my eye!  Was platoon ic this week, so freaking stressful! Wonder why some people are so overly laidback (ie slow and lazy) while some others are so demanding, abrasive and confrontational. So glad the nightmare is over, especially after the shouting session the instructors had at our expense during the field pack inspection that delayed our bookout timing by 2 hours...  I wanna watch kill bill!!!!  I wanna new monitor!!!  I want more money!!!!  I want longer weekends!!!  I want i want i want!!!!  Me me me me me!!!!!  Sigh.... that was kinda relieving. MY (got a MingYang in my section btw), over n'out

      About the USC bill, I just paid the lousy money hungry Americans, so no worries. I'm so much poorer. Curse you America and your high standard of living!  My friend was posted to Brunei for one year, he said he almost went crazy. The camp is in the middle of the jungle, even on off-days, there's nothing to do. But he came back freakin' rich.   I heard like in MP the 2 best positions would be undercover civilian MP where you can stroll around Orchard Rd in plain clothes and long hair, and the censorship-man, who spends his day watching pirated/illegal VCDs. Heh heh. Playing with the doggies sound so rad, I'll be so happy if I could be in the Dog Wing! Damn, I wish we have a puppy.  Anyways, my friend (Malaysian) is kicked out of NUS student housing because he didn't have enough ECA points, so we'll need to get a sofabed for the (new) living room for him. I wanna make the living room and our bedroom really nice and homely.    PS: Did u pay my phonebills?

      Somehow feel that this week was extra long for me, maybe cos' i couldn't wait to book out and play icewind dale 2.  MP course is pretty tough mentally and we'll have to start doing guard duty on weekends next week onwards cos' the RPs are posting out. MPs are mostly men, so pay is damn low sia. There was an offer by 2IC on an overseas posting to Brunei though. Pay, exclusive of allowance, is $1200 for the first month, dropping to $880 by the fourth month and all the bunks there are air-conditioned, but required to serve min. of 1 year and no home leave until after the 6th month. I was considering of applying, but then realised that there were others around me who were in greater need of this extra income than I (like my sectionmate whose father earns about as much as pa but in addition has 2 other younger siblings). Since i won't be going to brunei, i was hoping that maybe i could get into Spec training after the course (in order to improve my meagre income), or get into Zone Provost Unit (sounds fun) or Dog Wing (for the doggies) One bad thing about being in SAFPU though is that from dusk till dawn, you'll never fail to heard some barking or howling.  IMPT: Received a "Int'l Priority Air Mail" from USC, saying that despite the previous letters sent to you, you still have your account past due.what confuses me though is that it says your account balance is $1923.39; and on the next line it says the amount $1923.39. Intriguing accounting system, to say the least. Anywho, the account no. is 5483920456.  ----------------------------------THAT IS ALL--------------------------------- MY, over n'out

      Lucky you, being in MP and all. I remember I wanted to be a MP, then got posted to SISPEC. MP is the best life, I envy you. Better give me NDP tickets man...  And aren't you glad the whole school-choosing decision is done and over? I hope you don't get into Law though. Good salary but poor quality of life, that's why so many went into teaching. The rest of your choices are so dandy, so you'll either be curing cancer (NUS ideological Science), making female viagra (NTU practicality Science) or producing documentaries (Mass comm)!  I do hope you open a comic/hobby/game rental store, maybe we can be partners! Although this type of stores tend to lose money and close down...

      Heloo~~~ all you folks in Blogland out there!  I'm out for the Good Friday holiday, but then i got to book back in at 2230 later on tonight. and THEN, i have to book out the day following that for the weekend, and THEN book back in on Sunday. Pity the bookin/bookout ic.  So, i've been in the MP basic course for 4 days out of the 9 weeks it runs, and since it's the introductory week, it's been pretty smooth sailing. However, they're kinda firm on physical firmness there and we have pull-up regimes at least twice a day.  The instructors there are, quite suprisingly, damn fit and one outstanding example is 3sgt Chelliah; aka SGT. HELL. My goodness, he's so damn buff his No. 3 can barely contain his bulging muscular mass and he needs somebody to help him put on his MP placade. And , oh yeah, he's PES E9 for the moment.  There're only 2 platoons, but that's not necessarily bad.  The guys in my section are pretty cool, but kinda miss the guys in BMT. We have lessons the whole day, sometimes till as late as 2030. But at least we have a minmum of 7.5 hours sleep per night, with approximately 1.5 hours of  admin time.  With that, we've come to the end of today's programme. This is MY saying,  "Over n'out"

      So...  I changed my NTU choices to !st= Comm. Studies & 2= School of Biological science.  And I got posted to SAFPU as a military policemen. Seems they don't want me in OCS or SISPEC. Go figure.  That is all. MY, over n'out.

      Why i logged, i clicked and i applied; the outcome:   NUS--1st= Science faculty       --2nd= Law faculty NTU--1st= School of biological sciences      --2nd= Communication studies  Right now, i'm thinking that the life science course is much more well-rounded, judging by their incorporation of business skills into the 4th year modules, is a direct honours course (assuming good enough grades) and i have to apply again in order to get into life science over at NUS.  I hardly agree with your stand that this line of work would be "mugging technical stuff", especially with the life sciences field being such an R&D oriented area. I myself envision it as teams of scientists brainstorming, pioneering, but that could be just a myopic view on my part. But still, there're no formulas or procedures to follow in unchartered terroritory.  What line of work do i want to be it? That's the one question i've been confronted with since i was in Primary 6; and have been trying to evade ever since. However, i firmly believe one's career should follow one's interest. Personally, they have been Science, Media (TV, movies, animation, comics) and Games. Secretly, i think i have a certain amount of desire for public recogniton, and i guess i hope to achieve either through public debate over ethical issues raised through my work and decisions as a life scientist or through critical and commercial success over my creative works (via a game i'd made, a comic i'd drawn, a movie i'd directed or maybe the art direction on a series or a commercial)  Advertising? I had given some serious thoughts to a career in advertising before, but then i realised that opportunities for truly inspirational or funny ads were few and far between and that most of the time you were swarm in projects promoting mudane objects or trying to manipulate the masses to think they need a certain product.  Gaming industry? Located all the way in Japan and the US, but good games should really be left to the pros like the folks at Blizzard.  Comics as a career? Eats up more of your time then being in the medical profession.  Right now, i'm doubting myself as to whether i should have put School of Biological sciences before Communication studies (which has smaller intake and i might not get chosen for...) Still have until tommorrow to change my mind...  Enough of the monologue, but the idea career for me would be to open up a comic/hobby/game rental store and get to indulge in my hobbies as work. Or just become a professional playtester, you know, whichever comes first. If ever. hmpf. MY, over n'out

      The Blogger relaunch is kicking ass. Posts archive, new templates, comments, the works! Just in time too, since I'm back home soon this blog will cease to function as the long distance bulletin board. Maybe you should continue doing this and make this your social commentary blog, sharpen your skills by freelance column writing. Tons of  urlLink famous   urlLink journalistic   urlLink bloggers  out there.  urlLink Blogs  are nothing but the ability to self-publish information online.  So about you missing the Mass Comms boat this year, I guess the only thing to do now is to try again next year. At least you have another year to submit your application, so there's still a good chance. Good call to stick with NTU, because I heard it's rather hard to stream into Life Sciences in NUS.  Anyway all the media spotlight is because of Slackers. Singapore is so small and boring that doing webcomics can put me on TV news.  I will miss LA. I'm leaving one life behind and returning home different. But I'm ready to go home now. I've got FFXI too.

      Section mate (who's been accepted into mass comms) tells me that he was scheduled for the interview on the same day at the slot just before mine. As he was late, he was running around to all the interview rooms to find out where his was. He says that he did not see my name on any of the doors, and it strikes me as odd that i should receive the mail requesting for the interview at the same time as i get a place in SBS... Also, he says that there is only one interview board per year, so if i want to get in, i'm gonna have to wait till next year in order to reapply again i guess.  NUS letter also came in this week, was offered first choice of Science faculty, but think i'll stick with NTU...can't bare the thought of going through another selection process just to get into life sciences. Me thinks it's kinda dumb for the u to just accept students into a faculty and into a course... you just end up with people hoping to get into a certain course only to fall short and consequently have to take up something they're less interested in...  What LHZB call you for? Was it as a showcase for the youth section or as part of a larger article? And what's up with the TV deal, you did some unprecendented piece of cybercrime or something? Anyways, got something for you for you homecoming... ;^]  BTW: A 19'' flat screen monitor from AOC would have cost $315.  MY over n'out

      Flat screen nicer mah...  SBS also not bad mah, other than sharing the same acronym as a bus service. I'm sure if you send a nice email to the people involved and explain your case, somebody will get this mess sorted out. They should grant you a make-up interview, if the mail was late it's not your fault. Also we have not heard from NUS yet have we?  Anyway, I was interviewed by Lian He Zao Bao about Slackers via email, and now Channel i News wanna do a TV interview with me. I'll see how that works out. =)  10 more days and I'm back!

      Nope, the monitor isn't a flat screen...is that important?  The Ntu letter from comm studies was requesting i go for an interview to see if i were suitable for the course... The letter arrived late and thus i didn;t turned up and hence i guess they assume i wasn't interested and therefore was given my second choice, School of Biological sciences (SBS).  I guess i'm kinda annoyed cos i wanna see if i can make the cut for comm studies... Now, i'm asking around to see when's the appeal period, but i doubt i can get in through that route since i highly doubt they'll recall the panel of interviewers to see a few reapplicants who've missed the boat... In any case, I've left a message asking them to contact me, and i have been offered a place in SBS.  MY over n'out

      The truth is there's no such thing is digital privacy. Deal.  Is the monitor a flat screen?  I told mum to help pay my bill.  I'm returning early because 1. I'm running out of money 2. I miss laksa 3. I may be going to China in June 14th. I wanna stay back at home for at least 1 month before I fly again.  Hmm, I dunno how come NTU can offer you 2 spots. Maybe its because the Comm Studies one is conditional? Better call and ask. Wait for the NUS letter also ah!   Wat SBS?  Sp you have your heart and mind set on Comm Studies?

      Here i sit, in front of , unwinching from its glorious blast of non-redness, a spanking, brand new AOC 17" colour monitor as well as a Samsung optic wheel mouse! Bunkmate in camp recommended an AOC monitor as it was really cheap but dependable at the same time. So, after some monitor-hunting at Sim Lim after i'd booked out, i found 2 shops offering AOC monitors and seeing a price difference of a mere $3~6, decided i wasn't being scammed or something. There was a 15" going for $133, but i figured $166 for a 17" ain't bad. And it's looking great so far. Can actually see subtle details in games now. Picked up the optic mouse along the way after noticing a sign announcing "TODAY ONLY:$10 OPTIC MOUSE". Feels good, and has got a wheel, which i've always wanted (seeing as how those Graphire pen-mouse thingamajigs cost $108 at the cheapest) If you're thinking of DIYing the PC, bunkmate says to go to Skylet (one outlet at Sim Lim) where they'll assemble the setup for you. Just have to buy the parts of the setup from them. But then he says Dell's offering pretty good setups with a budget of around $1000.  You know Gmail saying they give you 1 gig of storage so you wouldn't have to delete anything? Actually, you can't *really* delete anything out of your account as they save it to gather information about the user...  Aren't you slated to return sometime around June? What gives? Anyway, you should look into your debit card account: A Starhub reminder was sent to mom that says you need to put some moolah in the account so that they can deduct $135.35 out of it or they'll cut your line. (think was pay by 7 may, not too sure)  Had GPMG live firing on morning before bookout. The scenery on temple hill awed all who saw, and the firing was fun for most except for some (incl. me), who had constant I.A.s...  Just received in the mail for me 2 letters from NTU, one dated 28 April pronouncing my successful application into NTU School of Biological Sciences and another dated 7 April informing me about being considered for admission into (my 1st choice) a course in Communication Studies and having to go for a written test and interview on the 17 of April. Who the hell screwed up, damn it?! This either means i have to retry during the appeals period, or it's a sign to go to SBS.  Grrrr.... MY, over n'out
