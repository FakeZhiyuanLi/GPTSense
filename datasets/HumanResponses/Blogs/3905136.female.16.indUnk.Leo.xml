      i fucking dont know what to do. Holly left me. she says we dont ever get to see eachother. its not my fault. the stuff that keeps me from seeing her is the stuff thats going to get me into college. I dont even know what to do. I told her it wasnt what i want. im just so... pissed of and sad and ... I dont even know what to do. Im just so frustrated. Screw it. now im just going to focus on my work. im not even gonna bother with anything else. because its not even worth it. she didnt even seem upset by it. Whatever. I dont even care. Well i do. but whatever. whatever... but as meghan said, everything happenes for a reason, which was verified when i got a 41 directly after it happened... its still shitty though mehh

      ugh my life has been soooo busy lately and will continue to be so busy until well... school starts. Im doing the tupper park ad thing this year, as well as taking method acting classes with ted, helping leah pick out flowers on tuesday, spending every other weekend with my dad, trying to find time to spend with my friends and on top of all that, ive been sick for like ever. I havent been sleeping real well lately either. and even when i do sleep alright, osama bin kitty (bear) wont let me sleep past 745. he'll come into my room and sit on me and purr and rub against me until i push him off the bed two or three times. then he starts meowing and thats usually when i get up. damned cat. AND ive been having really weird dreams lately. all of them including people i dont normally think about on a day to day basis. some more funny than others, some more disturbing than others. but definatly symbolism in them. For half of the dream ill be walking around without glasses and i see what a normal person sees, the other half ill put on my glasses, representing clarity, and see ghosts and stuff. well, it either represents clarity, or that i want super powers. hmmm. im supposed to hang out with meg today which should be sooooo cool because i havent seen her since school ended. things have been up and down with holly lately, shes a party girl. shell have a few drinks (mind you i dont party) and call me at around 3 am on my cell phone and say things like "im so sorry im a bad gf" and theres those times where she just gets so drunk that she thinks im against her. ive asked her to stop drinking and shes promised, but i dont think shes stopped or is going to. i love her when she hasnt been drinking, and if i told my dad about this he'd flip, knowing him. so i dont know what to do. well yeah i do know what to do but.... right. okay. thats my life as of late, give me some feedback. bethy
