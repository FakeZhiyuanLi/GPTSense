      Questions and Answers, computer class, section 2:  1. How does the increasing use of cameras affect privacy?   You get less privacy and are observed when you go out in public on cameras. You could be in a videotape that can be watched without knowing it.  2. Where do you think it is fair to have cameras installed? Not fair? I guess it is fair to have cameras installed in shops, public transportation, hotels and in other public areas so that police can catch criminals and help keep people safe. It isn't fair to have camera's in people's houses and private property without thier consent or places like bathrooms and changing rooms.  3. What is your opinion on this subject? I don't really care if there are cameras in shops, public areas ect, because its called PUBLIC. As in people see you anyways and there is nothing you can do about it even if there aren't cameras. You don't get privacy in public places because if you did, it wouldn't be public anyways.  4. If you feel that this is an invasion of privacy, how do you feel governments should help increase protection from the inclining terrorist threats? I don't feel this is an invasion of privacy, but am I supposed to pretend I do for this question? Ok. In that case, governments should put police in place of the cameras, who can watch and can take care of things. Other obvious things for protection without cameras: Don't trust anyone who supports terrorist groups and don't let people carrying bombs into stores.                               THE END

      Questions and Answers for computer class, first section: 1. Do you feel this would be something you would like to use?  2. Do you think society is ready for technology like this?  3. What would be the benefits of this technology?  4. What could become problems with this technology?  5. What other thoughts or opinions do you have regarding this technology  1. This is NOT something I would like to use. What is wrong with credit cards that are actually CARDS anyways? It would be creepy to have a credit card in my skin and annoying to have ads that are just for me be put in stores whenever I come in.  2. Not yet. Not until people can be sure criminals can't get info or frame people using the chips.  3. It would never get lost and would be much easier to go shopping.  4. Criminals could use it and gain info, loss of privacy as well.  5. I have no other thoughts or opinions regarding this technology.                    The end.

      HI. Back again. Apparently this web page isn't done yet. I have to type sumthin more. Hmmm...ok... I have nothing to say. At all. Life is boring. The End. Oh, I have one thing to say... I wish I had internet at home so I didnt have to do this at school. Then again, I wish for alot of other things too, none of which will come true, I guess. Like having a pet, and a camera and a real computer, not a laptop that keeps freezing. Too bad. NOW I'm done. Good Bye.
