       May 31 2004, Amsterdam Schiphol Int'l Airport, Near the Lockers    INCASE YOU EVER GET THE CHANCE TO CHOOSE...   I am going to break down the relative pros and cons of St. Louis Lambert, Detroit McNamara, and Amsterdam Schiphol international airports.  For those of you lucky enough never to have flown through St. Louis, STL is the clear loser of the three.  There are several reasons for this and there is no anti-hometown bias on my part.  First of all, there's nothing cool there.  As my dad pointed out, "The only thing they have to eat there is sausages.  Who wants sausages?"  While this is not exactly true, all STL really does have to offer are knock off fast food restaurants manned by real go getters...er, people who look at you like "What?  You want something?"  Secondly, the designers of STL decided to go for a soul-vibe feel by introducing a lovely purple and orange color scheme, coupled with...nothing else except giant stains all over the floor.  All in all, STL isn't really terrible...I mean, the planes land and take off.  That's what you're there for.  However, you would think that they would do something above and beyond.  Now, Detroit and Amsterdam seem locked in a fierce battle for number one.  The pros and cons of each are very different, and they are like Indian Jungle Cobra facing its archnemesis, the Wily Mongoose.  Detroit's most interesting feature is its shape.  Certain airports use a geometric theme to compliment the "futuristic" and "modernistic" idea of traveling via the air rather than stagecoach.  Charles De Gaulle, the worst airport ever (more later), uses circles for instance.  Now, Detroit is unique in that it really doesn't even use a "shape" for all I can tell.  If memory serves me correctly from gradeschool geometry, it's a definite line.  Definite lines are straight and connect two points.  Infinite lines go on forever in each direction.  Detroit's airport is just a gigantic strip.  There were 60 frickin gates, and rather than a horseshoe shape or anything like that, it's just the giant straight line.  Inspiration must have been a swine trough.  All is forgiven, however, by the fact that there is a giant, quiet monorail that constantly goes from one end to the other, stopping also in the middle.  Ingeniously, you can travel the entire airport in about 4 mins.  Suddenly the straight line theorem of airport design gains significant weight.  The best part about the monorail is that it simple.  Last year I had to use O' Hare's train system, and that required matching up a letter with a gate number, which was then further subdivided into color codes of yellow, blue, red and green.  This is great if you have a 8 hour layover like I do right now, but not if you're hustling to the other side of an airport larger Samantha Harvey's hometown.  Other than that, Detroit had Ford and GM t-shirt stores, Chili's, various sports bars, etc.  Nothing too crazy, but very functional.  The section I was in was very new and clean, unlike the rest of Detroit.  I actually saw a guy wearing a t-shirt that said "I'm so tought I vacation in Detroit."  Sweet, eh?  Now, I've only been in Amsterdam for an hour and a half.  This airport will hence be referred to as AMS.  There seem to be several sweet things this place has going for it.  First is this internet cafe.  For $8, I get 60 mins of online time.  I view this as a very good deal, considering airports usually inflate prices (see previous post), and the one in Detroit was twice as much for the same amount of time.  Secondly, another convenience is that scattered throughout the terminal are special seating areas where the chairs are S shaped and contoured like a lounge recliner.  They are very comfortable and you could actually fall asleep in them if you felt like it.  Detroit, on the other hand, had arm rests for every row of seat which makes laying down impossible.    AMS also gets bonus points for culture.  It has newspapers and books in 5 different languages, unlike Detroit international.  Secondly, they have a mini museum here that's free.  Right now they have these neat sketches of "exotic animals" done in the 1700s by Dutch naturalists.  It's interesting to see how one sketcher, the first time he saw the ghastly beast that is the Indian Elephant, was amazed that it could walk at all considering how weird its toes look.  He also exagerrated how sharp the tusks were.  But, it was cool, because it was something worthwhile to do.  AMS also ranks #1 in its duty free stores.  Detroit's DF prices were equal to the Q Mart in Cahokia, Illinois.  Here in AMS, Glenlivet, which should cost like $40, is only $25.  I spoke to Mihai (Mike, an American from SF), and he told me the best thing to do at AMS during these long layovers is buy a bunch of Bacardi and go hit up free refills at McDonald's to start prepartying with rum and cokes.  The way the route on NW Airlines works is that you fly out of Detroit at 9:30 pm and get here at 11:30 am (local) and then wait until 7:30 pm and get in Bucharest an hour and a half later.  Mihai's strategy (he's done this a few times, I gather), is to wait until about 3:30 and just start making drinks.  They also serve drinks on the plane, and the guys are picking me up at Otopeni and we'll immediately go out to our old haunts.  While inebriating myself does sound like fun, I think I'm going to pass.  There are a few reasons for this.  First, I have not slept in about 50 hours.  I woke up yesterday at 8am, did not go to bed at all, caught my flight out of STL, caught the flight out of Detroit, did not sleep on it, and now here I am.  I start work soon and I think "How do business professionals (or any professional) get everything done in 24 hours?"  Well, if sleep is optional, within reason, it seems a lot more feasible.  Actually, I don't feel tired...more in a phase of relaxed concentration.  Secondly, I've got a lot of good books with me and I'd rather read them.  Yeah, anyway...blah argh shizznits.  So, I think right now we're going to give AMS the #1 spot.  This may change, as in grades are incomplete until the plane leaves runway.  Now, I mentioned Charles De Gaulle in Paries as being the worst.  Why, why? You ask.  CDG is absolutely horrible.  Anyone who has ever flown there will tell you this, and I'm not even talking about the poor people who died when part of a terminal collapsed there a few weeks ago.  CDG is some weird modernistic piece of crap that was financed by the bloated French welfare state in an attempt to wow visitors.  Similarly to the Eiffel Tower, it looks neat on blueprints but is relatively useless in  3-D space.  CDG is made up of 6 cirlces.  The main terminal is a giant circle in the middle, and the 5 smaller circles are where the planes dock.  If you land in Circle A and have to get to C, there is no direct route.  Instead, you have to go *outside* and wait for a bus, which then drives all the way around the airport, taking like 30 mins.  From what I understand, this thing isn't that old so a more convenient system could easily have been built, but the circle design probably prevents it.  Secondly, there's absolutely nothing to do there.  The bookstores, typically, have nothing in English.  They don't have anything in Spanish.  It's all French.  Now, when I got to downtown Paris, I can understand not reprinting things in English.  The French like their culture, fine, that's cool.  But now we're talking about an *international* airport.  Where perople from *outside* of France fly in and out of.  Or, in other words, PEOPLE WHO AREN'T FRENCH WHO PROBABLY THEREFORE DON'T SPEAK FRENCH.  The closest analogy I can think of women's clothing store that didn't carry any tops.  Just pants.  And not only just pants, but only those weird capri pants that flare out with fringe.  No jeans, no normal length, no skirts, etc.  Just goofy capri pants.    If this doesn't make sense, the goofy capri pants = the French, all the other articles of clothing are the international travelers who have to look at the prententious steel and glass architecture for 7 hours.  Because that's all there is.  There are no duty free stores at CDG.  There's nothing except a few small cafes where you can get...if I dare say it..."crepes."  I would've followed Mihai's plan at CDG and made Beam and Cokes instead.    The seats there are also as uncomfortable as a bad rash.   RELIVING 6TH GRADE   I was thinking during this long commute.  Thinking about why I like to travel to Europe so much, and I think I have the answer.  It started because of two events: reading my first Clive Cussler adventure book, and watching the classic film "If Looks Could Kill" starring 21 Jump Street veteran Richard Grieco.  ILCK is about Michael Corbin, a highschool "cool guy" who was to go to Europe for summer school or else he won't pass high school.  However, there turns out to be another Michael Corbin on his flight who is actually a secret agent for the CIA.  That guy is killed on the flight by the enemy, but when high school Corbin gets off he is instantly picked up by the Brits who assume he is the real thing.  Hijinks ensue, and Richard Grieco, who is 18 here, ends up hooking up with that one really cute girl from "Scent of a Woman" and saving the world.    His car also has missiles.  If you haven't read Clive Cussler books, they're great.  They have the same general gist as ILCK: adventure, bad guys, global travel, neat gadgets, historical references, etc.  So, yeah, that's what did it for me.  Except my missions are more limited to "Ask for a hand towel in Dutch."   SWEETNESS   The hi-lite of my week definately occured yesterday.  It came to me that anyone who called my cell phone would leave me a message, but I would have no way to check it.  So, therefore, it might be a good idea to change it to let them know and to give them my email address.  Aha!  But wait...remember the secret agent thing?  I also have a cell phone for Romania.  I asked myself, "What would Richard Grieco do in this situation?"  Here was my answer: I recorded a message that went "Hello, you've reached the voicemail of Stephen Andrew Buser.  Unfortunately, I'll be out of the country indefinately for...business.  You can reach me on my international line at 09318203128 (I forget what it is) and I will contact you as time permits.  Good day."  Rock on!   TIME'S UP   OK, it's time for me to start closing down.  I'll probably log back on later just because I have about 6 more hours to kill.  Thanks for your posts, I enjoyed reading them.    Drew

       O SA MEARGA LA ROMANIA   It is 1:30 a.m. in Columbia, Illinois on Sunday morning.  I am leaving for Romania in almost 12 hours exactly (1:40) and I feel like the kid who wanted a GI Joe aircraft carrier for Christmas and bounds downstairs on Christmas morning and sees a giant gift with his name on it in the shape of a large, asymmetrical toy warship propped awkwardly underneath the tinseled tree and next to the coffee table.  Seriously, I have been waiting to go back to Romania since about mid-October.  I mean "waiting" instead of "wanting."  Wanting implies that it may or may not occur; I knew then that I would definately be going back, just as little Tommy knows that Christmas will eventually happen again.  That being said, I do feel really, really excited.    If this is your first time reading my blog, here's some backround: I lived and worked in Bucharest, Romania, for almost four months in the summer of 2003.  While there, I had many great adventures throughout Europe and Asia while learning much about the world and people who live in a culture different from my own.  The biggest lesson I garnered was that you have to make distinctions between "truths" and "societal conventions" whenever you think about people who are outside of your geographic and/or psychological comfort zone.  The problem with living only in one country is that while you are around people who have different perspectives than you, they are relatively similar to you as compared to the rest of the population of Earth.  I know everyone is different from you in the purest sense, but your best friend is not very different from you, than say, a Turkish convenience store owner who lives in outer Istanbul.  Once you hang out with the Turkish guy, you realize just how  differently  someone can think without being wrong.  I never got this and it really affected me when I first moved to Romania.  A "truth" is universal.  For instance, the multiplication table is a truth.  No one argues about whether it is wrong or right; it is so clearly right that it would be idiotic to do so otherwise.  A "societal convention" is something that may, on the surface, appear to be a truth, but in reality it isn't as universal a truth and may be simply relative.  Take clothes: everyone would agree that you need clothes.  Humans made clothes to stay warm. However, somewhere along the way, people decided that certain clothes were "right" for certain situations.  Which is true.  However, many people now snicker if you aren't wearing clothes with a particular label.  To them, wearing Wrangler jeans may be universally right, but not to everyone else, like the multiplication table.  I had to realize that there were distinctions between real truth and the millions of opinions I have about practically everything.  The thing I discovered in Romania, Greece and Turkey is that people wear all sorts of different "clothes" (literally and figuratively) but they have very justifiable reasons for those clothes.  Living in America, I was one of those people who thought that everyone else througout the world should wear Wranglers, and it wasn't until I had to face evidence on a daily basis that there might be something wrong with my thought process.  Greeks wear white shoes because...who cares?  LOL.  But unfortunately, I thought that was WRONG.  Literally, bad...the same way a rash is bad.  Hope that makes sense.  My findings from my analysis were that:  A)I thought I was right about everything   B)I was getting truths mixed up with conventions  C)I put as much, if not more, emphasis on mundane conventions as I did on truth  Now, this may sound very hoity-toity, and if you are able to sneak this into a conversation at Starbucks and fool that guy who always wears a scarf and an earth toned outfit, I'll give you a Werther's Original.  But seriously, I thought I was like, really, really, really, really smart until I went to Romania.  I then realized that I was really stupid, simply because I never considered what anyone else thought.  So, while my ego has been brought back into orbit, I feel a lot less argumentative and more...curious?  The trade off is worth it.  The best part was that I did become smarter without having to read a lot, which is the traditional idea of "getting smart."  This, on the other hand, was just realizing my computer had a really big virus in it and then hitting delete.  Again, this may sound great, or it may sound like a rough draft for UN Resolution #32515115514 "Dr. Phil Peace Plan for Justice and Harmony", but either way, I don't know if you can really just "realize" this.  I had to live in Eastern Europe for 4 months, and I didn't really figure out what I was thinking until a month after that.  So, if you can, live and travel abroad.  It may have a different effect on you than it had on me, but whatever that effect, I am almost positive that it will be good, as long as you have a decent attitude going into the whole thing.     LIGHTEN UP   Ok, I'm sorry!  I know that was pretty sappy, but it is true and it's been pent up for the last few months and I might as well get it out there.  But moving on...  Is inflation a massive conspiracy?  I really think it is.  Inflation is this idea that prices, over time, naturally rise.  We are told this is because someone decides to make a little more money and their raising their prices forces everyone in the supply chain to do likewise to maintain the same profit margin.  This is on a macro scale and occuring constantly, hence resulting in the cost of goods and services rising at about 4% a year.    Now, here is my take: if this general idea of inflation was true, then eventually everyone would have to raise prices, right?  If we started from scratch, then in one year, definately in three years, everyone's prices should rise.  I can't imagine a good not raising its price for five years.  According to inflation theory, this is what happens, right?  Wrong.  I can name a good that hasn't raised its price in about 15 years.  What?  The daily newspaper.  The STL Post Dispatch has cost $.5 for as long as I could bother my Mom.  It has ads, but could the effects of 15 years of inflation be offset by raising ad prices?  I doubt it.  Besides, the Post should naturally raise its prices anyway.  That's the point.    So, here is my theory: inflation is the sign of a healthy economy.  Yes, it does exist, but it is not some vague, random, unexplainable, "prices rise...just because...err..."  What inflation really tells us is this: sellers raise prices when they think, in general, the same number of people who currently buy their stuff will pay a little more for it.  This means that the buyers (or consumers) have the "fun money" (disposable income) to keep on buying rather than saving.  In other words, people have cash to throw around.  And excess cash is always a good thing.  The "conspiracy" is that all of these companies are able to blame "inflation" for their rising prices, when really they've figured out that you, personally, are 90% likely to pay that extra 10%.  The Post Dispatch illustrates this.  They haven't raised their prices because they know that people are using newspapers less and less to get their info. Cable TV and the internet are more portable and dynamic than pulp that smirts your shirtcuffs.  The last thing they want to do is annoy you by steadily raising their prices.    Phone companies, on the other hand, know that you'll pay fifty cents for a twenty three second phone call because if you don't have a cell phone and you need to call ASAP rather than waiting until you park the minivan at home, you won't care that 5 years ago it used to only be a quarter.   Now, don't get me wrong, I like my new definition of inflation.  When I own a business, I'll be trying to get as much of your money as possible, too...that's the idea of business.  So, in spirit, I've just become the worldwide leader and founder of an international conspiracy to accumulate as much wealth as possible.  So I got that going for me.  Speaking of phone companies, here is the latest tragedy I've had to deal with when talking to Verizon.  A few weeks ago, I got a new phone.  Now, on top of paying for the phone and signing a new contract, the Verizon and all cell phone companies charge you an activation fee.  Here is what happened:  Me: Yeah, this phone looks great.  Good ringtones, too.  Radio Shack Guy: Definately I own this phone too (they all say that).  M: So, looks like we've about got this wrapped up.  I was just curious, but what happens when you activate the phone?  RSG: Um...what do you mean?  M: I mean, why does the phone need to be activated, and how does it get activated?  I don't know anything about electronics and I was wondering about that the other day.  *RSG starts getting excited to talk about gadgets like my roommate BDub*  RSG: Well, it's no big deal.  We have to activated the phone in order to have it linked with the satellite.  It's how you get service (I already knew this).  To activate it, all we do is type in your number in the computer and hit the button and it just gets sent over the internet and it reaches the satellite in less than a minute.  *Me, feigning amazement*  M: Really?  That's it?  There's nothing else you need to do to activate the phone??  RSG: No man, that's it.  M: So, to activate it, all you do is click a button with your mouse?  RSG: Yeah dude, that's it.  M: Well, there's no way I'm paying $35 dollars for this bogus "activation fee" if that's all it is.  That's bullshit.  RSG: Huh?  M: Yeah, you just told me that's all it was.  A mouseclick.  So, Verizon is basically charging me $35 for you to click the mouse and calling that an "Activation Fee."  You ought to just charge me a "Handling Fee" when you hand me the phone box, or an "Education Fee" for telling me about the phones earlier.  That would give you profit margins of about 30000%, which is good.  Unless there is some other cost I'm missing?  RSG: Uh???  M: Seriously...would you pay $35 for that?  RSG: Uh...well, no, but you still have to if you want the phone.  M: Well, I'm sure Spring would be more understanding that I don't feel like just donating money to Sprint.  At this point the manager came over and basically told me I had to pay it.  However, I stood firm.  I mean, honestly, how can the manager tell me, the customer, I am wrong, when her own employ has just admitted that it is a total fraud.  In general, I could understand even a 20% profit margin...so, if the theoritcal cost to click the mouse was $.25 in employee compensation and $.25 for general usage of the internet, their cost would be $.5 and my "Activation Fee" should be about sixty cents, instead of $35.   I told the manager that charging me a profit margin of roughly thirty times a respectable margin was insane.  She came around eventually.   BEDTIME   Thanks for making it this far!  I always enjoy email, so please send it if you just want to say hi, can help me find a job in Romania, and/or have questions of some sort.    I will be typing again in 24-36 hours, hopefully from sunny Bucharest.  Have a great weekend and see you soon!  Drew

       Magheru Cafe, June 9, 1 a.m.    A Word on Reagan   Every paper in the country has about 4 editorials on Reagan's death.  I've spent about the last hour reading some of the better ones.  I don't have much to say, except that I wish I had been able to see his presidency with adult eyes.   A Few Days in Sibiu   So I went up to Sibiu on Sunday night and caught the last day of the International Theatre Festival.  Sibiu has become my favorite Transylvanian town.  The reasons for this are that it is very clean, and it has very pronounced Hungarian and German influences in the architecture and even in the schools, where German is still taught.  I am often asked "Why do you like Romania so much?"  It's hard to put into words, but it's not really me loving Romania so much as how the people here remind me of things I've forgotten.  Sunday night is a prime example.    When I got there, it was right before the ending ceremony.  I was standing in a line for drinks with friends, and *BOOM* all of a sudden fireworks are going off.  What was surprising was not the noise or the explosions, but that practically everyone who had been waiting in line for 20 mins left to go outside to see the fireworks.  The unusual thing was that these people were all adults, not children.  I was left there standing, and thinking, "They're just fireworks."  Maybe there's something to say about how the sheer amount of wealth and luxury in America can make you forget how awesome some simple things like fireworks are.  I left the restaurant and saw everyone "oohing" and "aahhing" at the fireworks, and clapping for the biggest ones, and cheering at the finale.  I realized I didn't enjoy Romania for its fireworks, but because Romanians often remind me of how I was once amazed at something as simple as bursts of light in the night sky.  Later on that night, the DJ started playing oldies for about a half an hour.  "Johnny B. Goode", "Rock Around the Clock", etc.  They were immensly popular, with people getting up and dancing, from 20 years old to 60.  Again, I hate to call it "child-like", but I can't think of a better word.  I don't mean it at all in a demeaning way.  It's just that people here really enjoy simple things like fireworks, going out for a beer with friends, old songs, etc.  In America among many people my age, any sort of activity or style must pass the "Will this make me cool or not cool?" test before people decide to like it.  I mean, honestly, how can you not like oldies and fireworks if you're in a "good mood?"  After this display we manage to straggle down the street to a guy's house.  Dawn was showing up and his mother was nice enough to cook us all omlets.  I tried to sleep but the only place for me was under the sink (Romanian houses are very tiny).  I managed to wake up and go meet Raluca around 11 a.m.   GREECE   Hopefully I will be heading to Greece and Cyprus soon...stay tuned!  Drew

       Megheru Cafe, Saturday June 5 4:00 p.m.    I LEARN TO MYSELF THE LANGUAGE ROMANIAN   Learning Romanian the past few days has been rather interesting, frustration and brain taxing.  I have discovered that you simply can't translate English into Romanian.  There is no need to say "I am going to the store", which would literally be "Eu merg la acest magazin."  Everyone here says "Merg la magazinul."  The reasons for this are long and complex, but trust me.  Beyond that, Romanians say adjectives after, not before the noun, and the verb is placed in the sentence depending on what other words you want to emphasize, not in order to determine subject and predicate.    If you were "glass half empty", this would be a real problem.  However, I've found that it really pushes your brain to understand grammatatical conceptss.  Why not phrase things in a different order?  As a college graduate, I can write pretty well, as can most other college graduates.  I think this tends to be a problem, because when you try and learn a foreign language you want to express yourself as clearly in that language as you can in English, hence you revert to the rules that dictate good grammar.  The problem is that you have to memorize a whole new set of rules and implement them as if they were second nature.  So, for a beginner, your choices are to either speak "English Romanian" or take forever to say things right.  The best option I've discovered is to just say without thinking.  They tell me these are the baby steps you need to take in order to not have to think everything right.  Then have a Romanian correct you and then repeat what they say.  I guess the idea is to use your own brain, then hear the correct version, then reinforce it by saying it a few times.  I can tell that it's helped my pronounciation.  The other way it helps is to learn the useful phrases that describe the same things in English but are literraly different.  For instance, "de cand?" means the exact same as "how long?" in spirit, but you would literally translate it as "of when?"  So, the more of these phrases you can understand, the better grasp you can get on how the prepositions relate to other words.   QUINTUS   I went to visit my old firm here in Bucharest, Quintus, yesterday.  They have a new office building close to Cismigiu Parcul and it is magnificant.  They occupy the top two levels of a giant mansion; the first floor has the executive offices, waiting room, etc., and upstairs is where the nuts and bolts accounting gets done.  My boss Jan has a great eye for design; the lower level is primarily light beige with a burnt orange color that seems Turkish.  It really lights up the place, even on days like this that are cold and overcast.    Everyone is doing well and the firm is continuing to grow.  Jan and his fiance are getting married this July in Poiana Brasov, a very exclusive ski-resort about an hour north of here.  Mimi, Andreia, and everyone else are very busy but that's a good thing, I'm sure.  MAINE  Tomorrow I'm headed to Sibiu, a Germanic town in northern Transylvania.  Supposedly it has the best architecture in the country.  Right now there is an international theatre festival going on, and some friends are going to give me a tour of the place on Monday.  This coming week I plan on maybe visiting some other towns rather than come straight back to Bucharest, because once you're up in Transylvania you might as well see as much as you can.  It takes 3 hours to get there from Bucharest, but once you're there, there are many neat towns all within an hour of each other.    In other news, Mike and Jeremy now have a DVD player, and you can tell this is huge.  Romanian cable tv offers BBC, Animal Planet and maybe Neo Geo, so being able to watch movies is priceless.  I brought the classic films "Roadhouse", "UHF" and "Big Jake" since I doubted they would be for sale over here.  Today I went to the Mall.  They now have an english bookstore, and it features primarily American authors, rather than psuedo-intellectual English novellas found at the hotels.  The store is an office store, computer sore, music and CDs...it's the first one like that I've ever seen here.  There's also a large discount grocery chain attached to the mall.  While these are the only two stores like this in town, one wonders when some large corporations going to stick in a Wal-Mart type store and offer the Romanians cheap, high quality goods.  The drama being played out in inner-city USA would be on a national scale here, where many, many people make their livings by running stores that sell primarily one line of products.    Ok, I'm outta here.  Thanks for your emails and I will be in touch shortly.  Last time I logged on the connection was very slow and I couldn't get anything done.  Take care and say a prayer for President Reagan, I heard he's not doing so well.  Drew

       June 3, Megheru B-Ddul, Bucharest, 8:30 a.m.    Hey, I'm On Vacation   I haven't blogged in a while because I have been recovering from jet lag.  I thought I had jet lag figured out, but it seems that I haven't.  The thing with jet lag is that I used to believe if you stayed up as late as possible on your first day in your new time zone, you could then sleep at the same time everyone else does and wake up around noon, generally in sync with the locals.  For some reason that hasn't worked for me.  I think it's because the light shines in every morning right on my face, or that I am still needing a lot of sleep.  I ended up being awake for 65 hours on my trip here and I guess it took a toll.  I don't have tons of cool things to report because I haven't done a lot.  On Tuesday night Mike, Mihaela, Natasha and I went out to eat at a restaurant called Piccolo Mondo.  It serves Turkish/Mediterranean BBQ and other food, like Falafel bread.  It was Mike's first time out of the house in about five days because he has a sore leg.  I am hoping that he gets better so that we can all go out.  He starts work next week and if he gets better we may take a trip this weekend up to Sibiu.  Sibiu is a town of about 300,000 that is closer to Hungary.  Every year at this time they have an incredible theatre festival that brings close to 100,000 visitors.  I know some people up there and they've asked me to come, but unfortunately I may only be able to go for a day.  I am here for three weeks but it's already passing very quickly and I have most of my plans figured out for this weekend.  Yesterday I went to the Powerhouse Gym.  They don't have a lot of gyms here, but luckily for me this one is about 10 minutes walking.  There's no fancy membership plans, all you do is buy either sessions or a monthly pass.  I opted for the month pass, which costs roughly $20.  The equipment is mainly low tech, but plenty of barbells and stationary bikes.  The hard part is figuring out which weights to use because they're all metric.  I plan on going again today.  Rather than be "Suave International Businessman", I have been leaving the house in white t-shirts and gym shorts.  It's simply not as hot this way and easier on the feet with New Balance shoes.    Later on last night I met up with Andreia, one of my old colleagues from Quintus.  She is a lot of fun and still working at Quintus as an auditor, and has recently been promoted to the head of an auditing team.  Now, whenever I am around Romanians I'm always bothering them with "what does this word mean?" or "how do you say that?"  I've made a point not to ever get impatient with someone trying to learn English because this is a very important part of the learning process.  Having a local be able to tell you and then help you pronounce it correctly is just something that is not readily available to me in the States.  I had sarmale for the first time in 9 months - heaven.  Sarmale is rolled up cabbage leaves stuffed with meet and then simmered for a few hours.  Trust me it's good...very simple, but good.  After Lido's (the terrace we ate at), we managed to find Cafe Mike's, a jazz bistro off the main roads that plays 1950's jazz and swing music.  Very nice atmosphere; they tell me they have a theatre in the back that shows old Rat Pack movies and the like.  Today I've got some errands to do: go back to Powerhouse, buy some clothes, stop by Quintus (where I interned), and visit with some old friends.  Yeah, like I said, I don't have a lot of interesting stuff yet but I will in a day.   One thing that is definately nice about being over here is that I don't have to listen to political coverage.  Wow, it was and is probably getting worse as the election gets nearer.  I am not talking about political parties, just listening to the talking heads on cable TV.  It used to be addicting, but now it seems more akin to professional wrestling: develop story lines, shout at whoever you're debating with, sound intelligent but vague enough to cover yourself, not offer any realistic, strategic solutions, etc.  When I left, this is what they were saying:  War in Iraq = We're doomed  Election 2004 = McCain as Kerry's VP?  It's probably still the same, until the major networks use polling data to find new story lines that are more interesting to the general public.  I really don't think you can predict who will win the election as of now...way too much time until the general election, and unless a major bombshell is dropped by one of the candidates or Iraq starts getting a lot better or a lot worse, I don't see this changing.  That's all I got; catch ya in a bit.  Drew
