      new goal: actually post once in a while.  Anyway, today I finally heard some records that I'm actually excited about. New Morrissey - not as bad as I was expecting!  Of course, the album cover is awesome, but really, after that you couldn't expect much more.  But I must say, by the end of the album I was really feeling it - a potential purchase.  EXCEPT FOR THE BLOODY FACT THAT THE CD IS NOT IN A DIGIPACK OR A CASE BUT IS STUPIDLY SHAPED CARDBOARD THAT WILL NEVER FIT IN MY SHELVES.  It seems petty I know, but after working in a record store where everything that's not your normal CD shape must be security tabbed and taped, you really hold a grudge against those CDs which feel compelled to be EDGEY STYLE CD and be a new size.  Case in point - new Squarepusher - haven't even so much as looked at it.  And secondly, the new Streets album.  Hadn't really paid much attention since OPM, but dang, when I put this on in the store today I was pleasently surprised.  Of course when he started dropping the random F-bombs I had to turn it off, because even a British accent doesn't hide the cursing from paranoid rich C-vill mommas.  But I'm looking forward to hearing more, I think.    Instant plus - comes in a normal sized jewel case.  Near future excitement - Animal Collective and Bark Psychosis in June.

       Lollapalooza 2004  has been cancelled due to low (or no) ticket sales. In a moment of touching clarity, Perry Farrell shares: "My heart aches along with the bands, and all of our employees, whose hard work developed one of the most exciting and important tours that this nation was to see.  My heart is broken."     Keep on keepin' on, my man.

       Isn't she a little young?   Sex with a minor.   Don't go there.   God, I love my hometown of Richmond, VA.  According to this  urlLink Wash.Post article , there's a new campaign to stop men from hooking up with underage girls.  What does the new campaign consist of?  Oh, I don't know, how's about putting up giant billboards with the above slogan written in hot pink and white lettering?  Ok, sounds good.  And lets not forget to send out hundreds of thousands of coasters, cocktail napkins and postcard-size messages too!  We could also make it cost upwards of $85,000, even though our in-state schools are basically falling apart! But for the not so funny part - the reason behind it all: between 1999 and 2000, 219 babies were born to girls between 13 and 14 yrs old. Eek.

      Oh snap -  urlLink Ray Bradbury hates on Michael Moore!  "Michael Moore is a dumb [expletive], that's what I think," Bradbury told the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter during a phone interview from Los Angeles. "He stole my title and changed the numbers without ever asking my permission."

      Oh great.  Now not only is our president a raging asshole and dim-witted fool, he also may be  urlLink insane.

      Someone on ILX described the m83 album (a while ago) as "being sprayed with giant windex bottles of hypercolor twinkle dust. like the turquoise hexagon sun is engulfing you. pleasant as it is, it's almost too much, too saturated, a day dream binge" - and I really can't even explain how OTM that really is.  I loved the album after the first few tracks but every subsequent listen just made me feel as if I'd eaten too many chocolates or something.  It's so damn dramatic that I can't stand it, and while I still like some tracks (run into flowers esp.), I couldn't care less about the US release.   Also, I went to the website (ilovem83.com)(presumtuous, no?) and almost had a breakdown because I thought it hacked into my computer. Fuck you m83!  On a seperate note, I got a copy of the new Morrissey as it came in used in a jewel case and not the absurdly large cardboard packaging we got the in. Whew.
