						   I came across this poem, and just thought I would post it...   If you can keep your head when all about you    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,   But make allowance for their doubting too; If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,   Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies, Or, being hated, don't give way to hating,   And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;  If you can dream--and not make dreams your master;   If you can think--and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with triumph and disaster   And treat those two impostors just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken   Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,   And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools;  If you can make one heap of all your winnings   And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings   And never breathe a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew   To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you   Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!";  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   Or walk with kings--nor lose the common touch; If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;   If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute   With sixty seconds' worth of distance run-- Yours is the Earth and everything thatâ€™s in it,   And--which is more--you'll be a Man, my son!  -- Rudyard Kipling

						      Unless one believes in reincarnation, we must face the fact that we are on this earth a very limited time.  While this eliminates some problems, like giving them enough time to find us, it presents others.     As I approached the mid point of my statistical life, I took account of where I am, what I have done, and where I am going.  One common theme echoes... regret.  Regret I let myself get caught up in the moment so much during school.  Regret at not finishing my degree.  Regret that I moved away from home for so long and lost two grandmothers and a parent while I was away (not that I have only regrets about moving away, as I have made many friends in far away places).  There are also quite a number of other things I won't go into because naming them would reveal enough to the "them" and thus allow myself to be seen.  Although one particular thing that stands out in my mind I feel a need to tell.     When I was living down south, a minister of my youth came through with his family and we met at a restaurant near the campground at which they were staying.  Payday was four days away, so I decided not to buy them dinner, but rather give the waitress the "separate checks" line.  I'm sure they didn't think too much about the separate checks issue, or anything of it at all actually.  They were probably relieved that they didn't have to pay.  After dinner, we said our goodbyes, promising we would meet again when I visited *the hidden city* again.  I didn't think anything else of it... until the morning several years later when I received a call that the minister had been murdered in cold blood, leaving behind his wife and several very small children.  It turns out he was killed by a man who "just wanted to try out his new gun."  Of all the things that could have gone through my mind, I keep asking myself why I didn't buy him and his family dinner that night.  Not a big deal, but still, that is one of those little regrets I carry around with me.  You never know when you meet someone if it will be the last time you see them in this life.     Two men were wandering lost through the desert, scorching sun beating down on them, hot wind blowing sand in their eyes, sores on their feet filling every step through the wasteland with a steady, annoying pain.  As they walk over a sand dune, in a valley below they see a beautiful desert oasis!  Cries of joy are uttered through their parched lips as they rush down into the life saving valley.  They drink their fill of water and eat the desert fruits to their hearts content.  After a night of blissful sleep, they awaken.  One says he will stay there, content to live out his days peacefully in the beautiful paradise they have found.  The other man walks out into the desert to find other lost and dying travelers.     How many people are we leaving to die in the desert?  Would it hurt us so badly to share a bit of the blessings we have received in life?  How many more chances will we have with those around us before it is too late?

						      It is always an interesting weekend when one sees something not seen that often.     After getting very little sleep Thursday and Friday night, due to an ephemeral and far too public obligation I ended up not getting home until 2:30 on Saturday night / Sunday morning.  After winding down and making sure the bunker was secure and everything was hidden to my satisfaction, I finally got to bed around 4:00-ish (heavy on the ish).  Ah, blissful, concealed, much needed sleep.  I didn't even remember my dreams, which is very rare for me.     9:00 AM.  When I sleep, one can usually hit me with a large stick before I will come out of hibernation.  But on this particular morning, a deep rumbling forced its way into the layers of unconsciousness.  I found myself in a semi-conscious state of confusion, having no idea what was causing my guts to resonate with such annoying force.  After about 10 minutes of trying to fight off the ephemeral world, gripping tightly to the shroud of the encompassing dream world, my mind was forced to confront the terrible force that violently pierced the sweet darkness.     It was a noise coming from outside.  I quickly went over the security checklist from the night before in my mind.  No, still unseen.  It must be coincidental.  Crawling over to the shade drawn window, I peeked out.  There, on the road that passes my house, hundreds upon hundreds of motorcycles were riding past.  Now that was something one doesn't see every day.  There were so many, I even had time to get my morning drink and stumble outside and watch the parade from the safety of my camouflaged porch.     As I'm sure you do too, I see motorcycles every day.  But seeing that many of them, knowing that this event was organized, and that hundreds of people took time out of their lives to just ride through the country on a Sunday morning... I don't know, but it was quite impressive.  And well worth waking up for.

						    I'm going to take some time out from my usually enlightened self to address something a bit more ephemeral.     When I see the polls of the Kerry / Bush race for the US Presidency, I have to seriously question their validity.  Mainly, it is quite possible Bush is far more ahead than the polls are showing.     Now, as background information, I am a former Republican who has changed parties (to the Reform Party, now that Perot is no longer at the helm).  I voted for Bush in 2000, but given his views on free trade and the applauding of shipping American jobs overseas (I am an IT professional), I am not planning on voting for him in 2004 unless something drastically changes.  I have no problems with the tax cuts or the War on Terror.  I have spoken to some people who have come back from Iraq and they said the mainstream media outlets are painting a majorly false picture of what is going on over there, but that is another story.     Anyway, last night I was sitting in my "cave" trying not to be seen, when the phone rang.  My first thought was 'OH NO!!! THEY FOUND ME!!!', but fortunately, I was wrong.  It was a person who was polling on several questions regarding the election.  Now, for seven years, part of my job required me to perform statistical analysis on data, which included survey data.  So I understand the need for asking neutral questions to get honest responses.     The poll should have included two opinion questions (as opposed to demographical questions).  1) Do you plan on voting for Bush, Kerry, other, or neither?  2) Are you for, against, or neutral on the issue of Abortion?     However, after the demographic questions, I was asked the following questions:  1) Are you for women having access to contraceptives?  Obviously, yes.  2) Are you for women having access to doctors for pre-natal care?  Again, obviously yes.  3) Do you think insurance companies should pay for pre-natal care?  Again, obviously yes.  If they are collecting one's money out of every paycheck, they should fulfill their end of the bargain.  4) Do you think women should have the choice as to whether or not to carry their baby to term or do you think the government should dictate the choices we make in our lives?  WHAT???  Where the hell did that come from?  I stated I was against abortion.  Her reply "So you think the government should dictate our lives?"  "No, but I am against abortion."  "Sir, just answer the question!"     WHO THE HELL WROTE THESE QUESTIONS?!?  At this point, I'm thinking about reaching for the duct tape to wrap around my head so as to keep my head from exploding.     Okay, so the questioning goes on.  5) If being pro-choice consists of allowing women to have access to contraceptives, pre-natal care paid for by their insurance carrier, and giving women the choice on whether to carry their baby to term, would you consider yourself pro-choice or *said with complete disgust* anti-choice?  I state that I am against abortion.  "Sir, answer the question please, or I'm going to have to throw your results out of the survey!"     At this point, I ask her why she is trying to get a pro-choice answer and who is behind this poll.  Oh the rigteous indignation I received when I asked that question.  Why did I assume they were trying to get a certain answer?  How dare I suggest such a thing!!!  Oh, I don't know, because am smarter than a BAG OF ROCKS?!?!?     Afterwards, similar questions were asked about the presidency.  I won't go into all the details, but they were HEAVILY slanted towards getting people to answer that they were voting for Kerry (such as am I in favor of having old people thrown out of their homes, or would I vote for Kerry), and several more times I was threatened to have my survey results thrown out.     Now, these days, polls are used to make news.  I was thinking about who was behind this poll.  For example, the last poll that showed Kerry ahead by the LA Times heavily oversampled Democrats.  Is it a left wing group that is going to run to the media and say "See!!!  People are for Kerry and are pro-choice!!!"     Being a sick and twisted individual, I often am able to think outside the box of what most people consider normal.  If a left wing group produced that poll, it would be dismissed as propaganda.  However...  The one problem that Republicans have right now is voter apathy.  Bush, while doing an pretty good job of things, has run amuck on a few hot button issues.  As I stated above, I will probably not vote for him because of his views on offshoring.  Other Republicans won't because of the impressions we are left with about the war, amnesty for illegals, drug company profits being protected by not allowing us to buy drugs from Canada, etc.  However, I am in no way going to vote for Kerry, because I believe he is even further out of touch than Bush and he doesn't understand the basic scientific / economic principle of cause and effect.  So, given the apathy of Republican voters, what would a poll that showed Kerry way out ahead do?  Energize the disillusioned Republican base.  Oh, how masterfully sinister, if this is the case.

						   Isn't it amazing how the choices we make, no matter how small, could completely change the course of the world?    What would have happened if the admissions chair at an Austrian arts school back in the late 20's / early 30's had decided to say yes instead of no to an application to study art bearing the name "Adolph Hitler"?  How many lives could have been saved?  Would someone else have risin up in his place that was worse?  What would have happened had Private Barton Mitchell decided not to pick up an envelope holding three cigars that outlined the plans of General Lee before the battle of Antietem?  What would the would look like today had the South won the Civil War?  What if Dr. Percy Spencer hadn't decided to put a chocolate bar in his pocket the day he was testing the magnetron?  What if Charles Goodyear hadn't accidentally dropped sulpher and rubber on a stove?  What if Pilate had let Jesus go instead of Barabas?  What if Truman hadn't fired McAurthur and had allowed him to drop atomic bombs on China during the Korean war?  What if one of our parents had said "Not now, I have a headache" on the day we were conceived?  Just something to think about and to keep in mind as choices present themselves to you today.

						     Greetings all.     Lately, while spending my time keeping out of sight, I've been reading several good books.  One of them is "Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance."  However, due to lack of free time, I haven't had a chance to get very far on it.  Working two jobs while trying not to be seen will do that to ya.  What little I have read though has really resonated with me (and getting through all the different layers of cover is no easy task).  One of the topics touched on is a common little greeting we all get from time to time.  "What's new?"     How much of our lives do we spend chasing after "What's new?"  A new experience, a new job, a new warning device, a new toy/toys, a new hiding place...  As an INTP, I am definitely guilty of this.  Although lately, as I have passed the half-way point of my statistical life expectancy in my quest to not be seen, I've started looking in the rear view mirror a lot more.  Well, for introspection, rather than its usual function of seeing who is sneaking up behind me.  As I do so, I have realized just how much more "new" there is to get out of things with which we are already familiar.  In the quest for newness, we only get the chance to skim the surface of all we reach out of our hiding places to touch.  Plenty of the experiences I've had in the past were spent looking forward to the next experience rather than fully experiencing what I was doing at that moment.     One thing that comes to mind from my youth was when my family went to the beach.  At this particular beach, I remember walking out to the edge of a pier that went about 100 yards out into the ocean on a night of a new moon.  A cool Atlantic ocean breeze gently pushing the sea mist to me as the waves broke against the pier's foundation poles.  Being surrounded by darkness on almost all sides, it was like I was standing on the edge of reality with literally nothing in front of me, to either side, above or below me.  Just the soft sound of the ocean, the smell of the salt water in the air, and one's self. It is amazing what races through one's mind at a time like that.  I didn't stay long, though, as there was just so much more to see and do at this beach community, with all the seasonal vendors hawking exhilarating entertainment for what was at the time a mere two hours wage.  I don't remember what I did after that, so I can't say that it justified leaving an experience that has stayed with me all these years.  But those five minutes I spent standing at what felt like the edge of eternity... how much more meaning would it have had if I had stayed longer to enjoy the quality of experience and not the quantity of "stuff to do"?      Have you had similar experiences?  I'd love to hear them.

						   Well, thanks to a Bush campaign worker, I am once again officially undecided whether to vote for Bush or for a third party candidate!  A little background: Offshoring has decimated the tech industry and a lot of former tech people have had to take low paying jobs in other fields. When asked by a reporter what they thought about those workers being unhappy in their jobs, the Bush campaign worker said that (paraphrasing) if they are unhappy with their jobs, they should quit, or  urlLink TAKE PROZAC!!!   UGH!!! SAVE ME FROM HUMAN STUPIDITY!!!  Now let's see how the Bush camp handles this. If they fire the girl who said it and say that her statements don't represent what Bush believes, well, then I'll be able to let that go as a case of "Stupid Campaign Worker-itus" and I'll reconsider voting for him.

						   I saw these 18 "oxymoronic" statements on someone else's blog.&nbsp; Since the response is kind of long, I thought I would respond to it here.    1) Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy when Bush needed a diversion because we can't find Bin Laden.   a) So the Soviet MIGs and AK47's were given to him by Reagan?&nbsp; Or did you mean the componenets of the WMD's that were sold to him by private companies as opposed to given to him by Reagan?  b) Left out the part about him invading Kuwait.  c) I remember something about a UN oil for food program, which turns out a lot of the money from it was pocketed by France, Germany, and Russia.  d) Oh, so that was the only reason?&nbsp; Nothing about the WMDs that the Clinton-era CIA, British intelligence, and Russian intelligence said he had, the fact that he broke the terms of the 1991 cease fire, and that he was sponsoring terrorists...  e) It is more like: Saddam is the lesser of two evils because he is fighting against Iran, he is bad because he invaded a neighboring country, he is being a good enough boy according to the UN by abiding by the terms of the cease fire that his oil went on the world market, then he kicked out the weapons inspector and blatently funded terrorism.    &nbsp;  2) Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.   a) I thought they were pushing for opening trade with Cuba, since the embargo had to do with them housing Soviet nuclear missles back in the 60's.  b) Trade with China and Vietnam in its current form is bad bad bad!!!!     3) The United States should get out of the United Nations, and our highest national priority is enforcing U.N. resolutions against Iraq.   a) First part is true in my opinion  b) Our highest national priority is to protect our citizens.     4) A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multi-national corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation.   a) If one believes that life begins at conception, when a woman becomes pregnant, her body is no longer her own as she has a responsibility to the life she is carrying inside her, convenient or not.  b) There should be regulation when multi-national corporations make decisions that affect all mankind, and in most cases that I know of there are.     5) Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton.   a) According to the bible, he does love you.  b) According to the bible, he doesn't hate homosexuals OR Hillary Clinton.&nbsp; The bible is very clear that we are to love all, as we all sin and fall short of perfection.     6) The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.   a) From what I understood, vet benefits and spending on military personelle has increased something like 20 - 30% under Bush.  b) According to my information, that is refering to a senate bill that failed, although John Kerry and John Edwards voted for it.     7) If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.   The issue here is about parental consent and the school thinking they have the right to trump the parent's wishes.     8) A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies, then demand their cooperation and money.   a) Going in to Iraq without the blessings of France, Germany, and Russia doesn't equal belittling.&nbsp; As I stated earlier, they had quite the sweet deal going with the Oil for Food program.&nbsp; Guess "No War For Oil" really had another meaning there.  b) How is telling them that since they didn't support us, they weren't eligible for lucrative government contracts demanding their cooperation and money?     9) Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health care to all Americans is socialism.   a) Bad craziness  b) Bad craziness    &nbsp;  10) HMOs and insurance companies have the best interests of the public at heart.   They have their own interests at heart, but socializing all healthcare isn't the best answer on how to fix the problem.    &nbsp;  11) Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools.   a) Global warming&nbsp;IS junk science.  b) The only people I know who are saying that tobacco's link to cancer is junk science is the tobacco companies.  c) Creationism is one religion's view and shouldn't be taught in school.     12) A president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense.   Seem to have left out the part about "Under Oath".&nbsp; Lying about anything under oath is an impeachable offense.    &nbsp;  13) A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy.&nbsp;  a) Bush didn't lie. b) WMD's were found (Sarin and Mustard Gas).&nbsp;    14) Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.   a) Had the constitution been amended, banning gay marraiges would have been part of the constitution.&nbsp; And most people didn't care one way or the other.  b) There was a huge split amongst conservatives about censoring the Internet.     15) The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but George Bush's driving record is none of our business.   a) Bush's driving record is a matter of public record.&nbsp; He used to be a party boy and a heavy drinker.&nbsp; You enter the political arena, your past is fair game.  b) Hillary's cattle future trades were impossible within the confines of the law.&nbsp; At the time, there was NO WAY she could have earned $100k on a $10k investment legally.&nbsp; It was market manipulation as a political payoff from Tyson and should have been treated as the crime it was.     16) Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness, and you need our prayers for your recovery.   a) What Limbaugh did was a moral failing and a crime.  b) All drug addicts need prayers for their recovery.     17) You support states' rights, which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can tell states what local voter initiatives they have the to adopt.   a) Such as?  b) Or did you mean like how the feds tell states that they must pay for government mandated Welfare?     18) What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but what Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant.   See 15A above.   &nbsp;  From your friendly neighborhood Thinking Christian Conservative.&nbsp; :)

						    Here in the Hidden City, there is an area of town that we shall call "The Square".&nbsp; It is an area that was meant to look like the Hidden City of Yesteryear.&nbsp; It is where a lot of events take place, such as "Concerts in the Square", where certain bands that used to be good but now suck because they got rid of their Yeti-like bass player strum forth their alterna-suck music, where a lot of peaceful protests against the war in Iraq occur, where people used to be able to walk around and visit the shops and restaurants without fear of being accosted, and more recently, where the homeless congregate on Thursday nights.   Recently, a group of students from a neighboring state's Catholic college have been driving into "The Square" like clockwork on Thursday night in a van loaded with food to feed the homeless.&nbsp; Sounds like a great thing, doesn't it?    Sherman, set the wayback machine to 20 years ago.&nbsp; A lot of these people were in mental institutions getting the care they needed.&nbsp; In walks the ACLU and sues to have them released since they are only marginally impared and should be able to function on their own in society.&nbsp; Whether this was the right thing to do or not I haven't decided.&nbsp; Positives and Negatives to both sides.&nbsp; Anyway, thus begins a large swell in the nation's homeless population, which is promptly blamed on then President Reagan.   Back to the present.&nbsp; Every Thursday night, the group of students go down to The Square.&nbsp; So, the Hidden City's homeless population congregates early, jockying for a good place in line.&nbsp; An image of Julie Andrews comes to mind singing "Feed the bums, toppins a bag..."   Now, the businesses who are paying outrageous rent and taxes to be in The Square have started complaining.&nbsp; After Bum-a-palooza, it is they who have to clean up the vomit and urine off of their sidewalks, not to mention that most people won't come within a country mile of The Square anymore on Thursday night for fear of being begged for money, insulted, or in some cases attacked by the throng of less fortunate.&nbsp; Plus the fact that the smell lingers until well into the weekend.&nbsp; In fact, next Thursday, I am going to try to take my digital camera down there and get a few Bum-a-palooza pictures.   Now the catholic students just claim they are doing the work that Christ as told them to do (in spite of such verses as Matthew 6:1-4 and 2 Thessalonians 3:10).&nbsp; However, the bible makes distinctions between those who can not work and those who will not work (most of the homeless that show up on Thursday night are quite able-bodied).&nbsp; Plus the fact that we are told to do works in private, not to do it in public shouting our deeds from the rooftops.&nbsp; From what I heard, these students get quite indignant if someone suggests that they stop what they are doing.   But, here is a solution.&nbsp; When I lived down south, the city I lived in had a large homeless population.&nbsp; As a response, there were pletny of soup kitchens around.&nbsp; A lot of these groups would volunteer there and make meals for these people there.&nbsp; Having participated myself, I can say that this food was often better than I, a struggling tech, was able to afford for myself.&nbsp; However, it really gave us a good feeling being able to supply these people a good meal, and many of them used the shelter as a springboard to get back on their feet.&nbsp; Here in the Hidden City, we also have many of these places.&nbsp; Many more, in fact, than they had down south.   I'm all for helping those who are less fortunate than us.&nbsp; In fact I believe it to be a necessary application of my faith.&nbsp; But let's do it in a manner that is beneficial to all. &nbsp;

						    Well, since it is an election year, once again the Democrats are proposing an increase in the minimum wage, this time taking it to $7.00 an hour.&nbsp; On the surface, a lot of people will think "What a great idea!&nbsp; Take those greedy bloodsuckers for all their worth!"    However, the problem with this line of thought is that the greedy bloodsuckers won't be the ones who end up paying it.&nbsp; That's right, boys and girls, you will.&nbsp; Now maybe you don't have a problem paying more for your Soylent Green burger at McDonalds and think it will help a lot of people out.&nbsp; Well, the truth of the matter is that most people on minimum wage aren't the sole providers for their household, most of them live in households that are well above the poverty level, yada yada yada...    So why then are the Democrats proposing this if so few voting age people would be affected?&nbsp; Well, because minimum wage workers are the tip of this iceberg.&nbsp; That's right folks, we are talking about Unions.&nbsp; Most union contracts are tied to the minimum wage.&nbsp; Minimum wage goes up $2.00 an hour, a guy making $17.00 to flip a switch is suddenly making $19.00 an hour to do the same work.    And since you can't do something to the economy without experiencing the ripple effect, let's follow this ripple a bit.&nbsp; McSoylent employs 8 people for the lunch shift, lets say.&nbsp; Suddenly, minimum wage goes up.&nbsp; Well, the McSoylent Corporation isn't going to take the hit to their bottom line, so what do they do?&nbsp; They "emancipate" two of the 8 wage slaves they have working their lunch shift to allow them the privledge of expanding their horizons (*sniff sniff*&nbsp; Smell that?&nbsp; That was sarcasm).&nbsp; So now, the other six wage slaves have to work harder to provide the same level of service.&nbsp; And since this doesn't quite make up the entire amount of lost revenues, the head Ronald at McSoylent decides to raise prices.&nbsp; Now, an Extra Soylent Meal costs $5.00 instead of $4.00.&nbsp; This is to say nothing of other cost cutting measures, like consumer downsizing, safety spending (the kind that prevents fun things like Mad Cow), and quality assurance.    Now, lets go up the chain a bit.&nbsp; Here I am, working for a grocery chain in the Hidden City.&nbsp; What happens if they suddenly have to pay all of the grocery workers an extra $2.00 an hour?&nbsp; Well, in order to stay competitive, they will most likely offshore their IT staff.&nbsp; There's the "O" word again.&nbsp; The word that causes a hemorage in the US economy.&nbsp; Less higher paid workers that are suddenly not able to afford to buy "stuff" to keep the economy going.&nbsp; Moving us closer and closer to a two-tiered society of rulers (government officials, company owners, executive management, salesmen, and lawyers) and the low paid unwashed labor masses that is the rest of us.    Cause and effect can be a real pisser.

						   What is it about signs that make us give them ultimate authority over our lives?   An example: After lunch today, several people went by the mens room.&nbsp; There was a sign on the door that said "Restroom Closed For Cleaning."&nbsp; Yet the person who was going to be cleaning it was just starting in the ladies room.&nbsp; After ignoring the sign and coming back out, I watched person after person walk by, swear, and keep going.&nbsp; Sometimes very gingerly.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because they gave the sign authority that trumped their own needs.   Now some signs there are concequences for ignoring, like No Trespassing, Speed Limit, and Stop signs.&nbsp; Other signs, however, we should still view as still open to negotiation.&nbsp; Signs stating prices, for example.&nbsp; A business' "Closed" signs (when there is someone inside, not advocating breaking the law here).&nbsp; Signs that try to modify our behavior for no apparent reason, like the ones that require us to snake through those sheeple hearders at the bank when we are the only ones in line.   Do you think that price signs on Sears big ticket items carry authority?&nbsp; Have the salesman show you every single model of refridgerator... twice... then see if he is willing to negotiate the price once he's put several hours into you.   There is no "Great printer in the sky" who makes those signs.&nbsp; They were made by imperfect people just like us, yet we still give them authority that trumps our free will.&nbsp; As far as I'm concerned, unless there is a law against it, EVERYTHING is open to negotiation. &nbsp;

						    Ah, sweet radio.&nbsp; Music, news, and political commentary that make the long commute to work through the construction-laden Hidden City almost bearable.&nbsp; However, with said entertainment, there comes a price... Commercials.    Here in the Hidden City, there is a car dealership that has really been irking me for a while.&nbsp; Let's just call them "Third Millennium Chevrolet".&nbsp; They've had the same jingle that they have played on the radio for, no lie, since 1979.&nbsp; It goes something like *sung by chorus of children* "Third Millennium... Chevrolet... Syrian Temple Road, Hidden City." *spoken by a child*&nbsp; "Minutes from the Mall!!!"&nbsp; Now, that isn't too annoying, but picture hearing that six or seven times a day for 25 years.&nbsp; Makes one want to run screaming through the night with a butcher knife.    Now, that isn't my only complaint with this company.&nbsp; They also insult one's intelligence.&nbsp; "New Chevy Cavaliers for sale!&nbsp; $129 a month!&nbsp; 100% of qualified buyers approved!&nbsp; Options extra."&nbsp; Well OF COURSE 100% of qualified buyers will be approved!&nbsp; If you aren't approved, you aren't a qualified buyer!&nbsp; That's like saying "100% of deaf people can't hear!" and stating it like it is the one Zen statement that will bring enlightenment.    Now, on to the $129 a month.&nbsp; I'm not in the market for a new car, as I have a terrorist-friendly environmentally irresponsible SUV.&nbsp; But I did some research on that $129 a month... well, I called.&nbsp; Turns out that that is the base cost without some "optional accessories".&nbsp; What are these optional accessories?&nbsp; Oh, things you may or may not need like tires, seats, windows, and an engine.    *Added Experience from a Local Ranting Yeti*  When I was looking for cars a few years back I looked there, everything was kinda pricy.&nbsp; I looked at a Grand Am and it was like 14,500 or something like that.&nbsp; So then, a couple weeks later I heard an ad that was one of those "3000 drag, drive or pull" sales... basically we'll give you 3k for any car you bring on the lot.&nbsp; I figure, okay... 11,500 for a Grand Am wasn't bad... So I head up..&nbsp; PRice tag on the EXACT SAME GRAND AM?!&nbsp; 17,500.. of course.    Don't you just love businesses like that?&nbsp; If you have any similar stories about businesses in your area, I'd love to hear them.  &nbsp;

						   Whoopie Goldberg has been fired as a Slim Fast spokesperson due to her performance at a Kerry fund raiser at Radio City Music Hall.  To quote the NYT: "Waving a bottle of wine, she fired off a stream of vulgar sexual wordplays on Bush's name in a riff about female genitalia."  No big deal, as lots of celebs are doing this now.  Not that I care, as they are entertainers, not political pundits, and I don't give a spit in a bucket of snot what they say.  A vast majority of them don't live in reality anyway, spending their days pretending and being fawned over.  Besides, we have the First Amendment, and they can say whatever they want, right?  Well, stop the presses!  Whoopie gave her opinion and Slim-Fast FIRED her because of it!  I'm hearing a lot of screaming that this is a violation of her First Amendment rights.  WHAT HAPPENED TO FREE SPEECH???  Apparently to these people, free speech means speech without concequences, which is laughable.  Everything we do has concequences.  A ruling that Slim-Fast has no right to fire her would be a greater affront to freedom than her getting the sack.  In spite of what we are hearing from the mainstream left-leaning media, Bush is still quite popular as a president.  Her comments could, and probably would, impact their sales.  It was a sound business decision to fire her.  We all still have freedom of speech.  I don't see the brownshirts going to arrest Whoopie for speech crimes.  She was free to say what she wanted to say.  However, I am also free to disagree and criticize, and to vote with my wallet.  Slim-Fast realized this, and their decision was sound.    Hats off to you, Slim-Fast.  Too bad your product sucks.

						   I came up with one of those "get to know you better" type of political quizzes.  Feel free to copy and use.  It will be interesting to see what people say.  For or Against: - Gun Control Against.  2nd Amendment is an individual right.  -Abortion Against.  I believe life begins at conception, so abortion is murder.  -War In Iraq For.  I also believe things are going well there, considering what we are up against.  -War On Terror For.  And I believe Iraq IS part of the war on terror.  -Free Trade Against.  With the exchange rates, free trade is causing our economy to hemorrhage.  -Offshoring of Jobs Against.  A thousand times against.  This is BAD BAD BAD for the American economy!  -Illegal Immigration Amnesty Against. Don't reward illegal activity.  And we should charge Mexico $40k per person that comes across our boarder illegally that we have to return to them.  You know, the way they do it to the countries on their southern boarder.  -Increased Environment Regulation Against.  A lot of environmental issues are based on shoddy, agenda driven science.  This is one of the reasons we haven't built an oil refinery in 25 years.  -Global Warming Policies Against.  Global warming as a result of human activity is completely unproven.  -Kyoto Protocol Against.  CO2 is not a pollutant.  -Socialized Health Care Against.  -Laws punishing Hate Speech Against.  1st amendment thing.  ALL speech must be protected, even speech we don't agree with.  Besides, who's going to decide what is Hate Speech?  The government?  No thanks.  -Hate Crime Legislation Against.  A crime is a crime, no matter who it is against or why it is against them.  I believe that they should all be punished consistently.  -Making the Bush Tax Cuts Permanent For.  Tax cuts are a good thing as they spur the economy, and the "rich" pay most of the federal income taxes as it is.  Plus, at my measly salary, I would be considered rich as I saw a decrease in my taxes.  -Death Penalty For.  -Tracking Foreign Nationals For.  -Oil Drilling in ANWR and the Gulf For, until we can find Alternative energy sources.  -Alternative Fuels Research For.  We need to get off of this oil thang.  -Embryonic Stem Cell Research Against.  I believe that life begins at conception.  -Patriot Act Against.  It gives the government too much power.  -Racial Quotas Against.  It is another form of discrimination.  -Constitutional Ban on Gay Marriage Don't really have an opinion, but I am leaning to Against.  What do I care what two consenting adults do?  -Campaign Finance Reform Against, in its current form.  Why is the solution to people being pandered to by special interests to limit my right of free speech?  Besides, there are too many loopholes in it.  -Partial Social Security Privatization For.  With the Baby Boomers retiring and withdrawing from their 401k's, the stock market is going to be in some serious trouble without it.  And there is no lockbox!  -Reduced Defense Spending Against.  The defense of our country is too important.  -Gender Based Quotas Against.  If we are all equal, we should be treated equally.  Gender Based Quotas are not the answer for equality.  -Logging on Federal Lands For, as long as they replant.  Trees are a renewable resource.  -Ban on SUVs Against.  I believe that Global Warming is being caused by the sun, as Venus and Mars are getting hotter also.  -Teacher Led Prayer In Public School Against.  That is not what they are paid for.  Although I don't believe that students should be banned from praying.  -Membership in the WTO Against.  The WTO is a flaccid organization who isn't willing to tackle real problems.  -Increased Pressure to Change China's Currency Manipulation For.  Cheap crap at Wal-Mart now could easily mean economic collapse later.  -US Membership in the UN Against.  Pull us out.  The UN has grown beyond its original charter and is trying to be a world government.  -American Sovereignty For.  As I said above, pull out of the UN.  -Decreasing the Power of American Courts For.  Judges shouldn't legislate from the bench.  -Taking Steps to Eliminate the Trade Deficit For.  Free trade is bad.  Trade deficits are worse.  Could lead to economic collapse.  -Animal Rights Against.  I don't believe that animals have rights.    Scale of 1 to 10 (1 being Don't Agree at all, 10 being Agree Completely):  -Bush is intelligent 8  -Kerry is intelligent 8  -Bush is in touch with the common man 2  -Kerry is in touch with the common man 2  -Cheney is evil 6  -Edwards is evil 8.  He's a trial lawyer.  Heh heh.  -Cheney, if needed, will be able to step in as president 9  -Edwards, if needed, will be able to step in as president 3  -Bush has a grasp of the issues 8  -Kerry has a grasp of the issues 7  -Bush will improve the image of the US abroad 1, but I don't really care.  -Kerry will improve the image of the US abroad 9, but I don't really care.  -Bush is most likely involved in illegal activities 3  -Kerry is most likely involved in illegal activities 3  -Bush will pander to the special interests and his campaign contributors 9.  He has so far.  -Kerry will pander to the special interests and his campaign contributors 9, just different ones than Bush, obviously.  -Bush stole the 2000 election and was appointed by the Supreme Court 1.  Bush had the rule of law on his side.  FL court tried to legislate from the bench.  If you want to argue this one, feel free to e-mail me.  -People who vote for Bush are stupid 1  -People who vote for Kerry are stupid 1.  Difference of opinion does not equal lower intelligence.  -I can understand why some people will be voting for Bush 10  -I can understand why some people will be voting for Kerry 10  -I will be voting for Bush 7.  That free trade / offshoring thing just chaps my behind.  -I will be voting for Kerry 1.  No way in hell.

						   An interesting article I found:   COLLAPSE OF THE EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD ACCELERATES Mon Jul 12 2004 18:17:38 ET  The collapse of the earth's magnetic field, which both guards the planet and guides many of its creatures, appears to have started in earnest about 150 years ago, the NY TIMES is planning to report on Page Ones Tuesday.   Science reporter Bill Broad has filed a report, according to newsroom sources, which explores how: 'The field's strength has waned 10 percent to 15 percent so far and this deterioration has accelerated of late, increasing debate over whether it portends a reversal of the lines of magnetic force that normally envelop the earth."  Broad explains: "During a reversal, the main field weakens, almost vanishes, and then reappears with opposite polarity. Afterward, compass needles that normally point north would point south, and during the thousands of years of transition much in the heavens and Earth would go askew."  Broad claims: "A reversal could knock out power grids, hurt astronauts and satellites, widen atmospheric ozone holes, send polar auroras flashing to the equator and confuse birds, fish and migratory animals that rely on the steadiness of the magnetic field as a navigation aid."   One has to wonder what this will mean for our dependent-on-technology society.  Or what other sort of false phenomenon this is causing us to think we are observing *cough* *global warming* *cough*.  Heh heh.  Just my opinion on an observation.  And if you want to discuss global warming and why I believe it is a false crisis, feel free to e-mail me.

						   Have you ever needed to put your trust in someone else?  How often do they let you down?  How often do you let them down?  How did it make you feel when they blew off something they were supposed to do for you for something "more important?"  Here's a little story.  A man is in prison for the rest of his life.  He desparately wants to escape.  One day in the cafeteria, he has the chance to talk to the groundskeeper.  The groundskeeper is an older man who is employed by the prison, but unlike the guards, he has a soft spot for people with sad stories.  Well, the man begins to spin a yarn about how his wife is dying and his children are starving, and he was put in prison for a crime he didn't commit.  He sufficiently tugs on the groundskeeper's heartstrings and convinces him to help him escape.  The groundskeeper comes up with a plan.  The next time someone dies, the man is to feign illness and be put in the prison's hospital, which is right next to the morgue.  That night, he is to sneak from his hospital bed and hide in the coffin with the recently deceased.  The next day the coffin will be burried.  That night, the groundskeeper will come by the grave and dig up the coffin, freeing the man and allowing him to go home to his fictional family.  Two weeks later, the man hears that someone has died.  He complains to the night watch of a sharp pain in his abdomen.  The guards come and take him down to the hospital.  Right before dawn, he sneaks into the morgue, finds the casket, and hides inside with the body.  Later, he feels the casket being picked up, carried, driven, and lowered into a grave.  He can hear the clods of dirt hitting the coffin as he is burried.  He waits.  And he waits.  And he waits.  After a while, he begins to get worried.  He reaches down into his pocket and pulls out a matchbook.  Lighting the match, he finds out why he has been waiting so long.  Sharing the coffin with him is the body of the old groundskeeper.  What do you put your trust in?  Other people?  Remember, other people come and go from of our lives.  They have their own interestes, and no matter how good they are and how good their intentions, other people will occasionally let us down.  The only constants in our lives are ourselves and God.

						   Oh boy!!!  More bitterness!!!  One thing that really irks me is hypocrisy and inconsistency of thought.  I'm not talking about the "They are hypocrites because they don't act like what my interpretation of their religion is" variety either.  A little background.  I can't STAND Michael Moore.  He twists the truth, uses editing to mislead, outright lies, then presents his creation as a factual documentary.  Plus his smarmy, self loathing, poor-me-vicitm attitude really rubs me the wrong way.  Sherman, set the wayback machine to 12 years ago.  Rush Limbaugh appears on the national scene.  He takes the airwaves by storm and gives a voice to a huge conservative demographic of the country in a way that has never been done before.  What are the major attacks from the left?  "He's FAT!!!  Why would anyone like to listen to that FAT-ASS!!!  Rush is RIGHT FAT!!!  Rush Limbaugh is a BIG FAT IDIOT!!!"  Very classy from a group of people who claim to be based on inclusion and to stand against group-ism, which the right threw back in their face, and rightly so.  Back to today.  These very same people who were bashing the left for ripping on Rush because of his weight are doing the EXACT SAME THING to Michael Moore!!!  Glenn Beck, Jim Quinn, and Michael Savage to name a few.  COME ON PEOPLE!!!  There are - SO - many things to bash Michael Moore on, must you resort to the "He's Fat!!!" attacks that you were pissed about a mere 10 - 12 years ago???    So disappointing.

						      Ah, sweet bitterness.  Haven't seen you in quite a while.     John Kerry (He's a war hero, you know) has picked NC Senator Edwards as his running mate for this fall.  This was a good move for Kerry (who is a war hero, you know).  At first, I was thinking, this will bring in the southern vote for the Democrats.  But after some reflection, I don't think this is the case.  Bush is an extremely galvanizing president.  Most people who pay any attention to politics fall into three groups.  1) They LOVE Bush and he can do no wrong.  2) They used to like him, but there is an issue or two that has made them disaffected and they probably won't end up voting this time.  3) They just HATE Bush and would vote for a block of wood with a head over him just to see him OUT OF OFFICE!!!  Now personally, I fall into category 2.  I think what he is doing in the War on Terror is a good thing.  I believe things are going well in Iraq, much better than we are hearing from the major news outlets (based upon what several people who either were or are over there have told me personally).  I think the tax cuts were a very good move, as the added economic activity brought about by them gives us a multiplier effect which actually ends up bringing in MORE tax dollars.  The two issues, however, that bother me are amnesty for illegal aliens and free trade, namely the applauding of the offshoring of American jobs.  Both of these have got to stop.  With all things being equal, I believe that Amercia would do very well with free trade.  However, all things are NOT equal.  That is another rant, though.  Basically, what I see is catering to corporations by lowering the cost of labor.  So we will end up in one of TWO classes: Wealthy stockholders & Lawers, and the rest of us (fry cooks, garbage men, and wal-mart shelf-stockers).  Now, I'm sure that isn't the intention, as that is just plain evil.  It will however be the eventual result of the current economic policies.     ANYWAY, I will not vote for John Kerry (even though he's a war hero, you know).  Kerry's (who's a war hero, you know) best chance is for the above mentioned group 2 to either stay home and not vote or vote for a third party candidate.  Edwards will help accomplish that, because as of right now, most group 2 people don't have an opinion about Edwards.  However, had Kerry (who's a war hero, you know) picked Hillary Clinton, I and most other group 2 people would crawl through a pit of poisonous snakes to vote for Bush.  So, Edwards was a good choice for Kerry's (who's a war hero, you know) VP, but I doubt it will have much effect on things, since in this election, it appears that most people will either be voting for or against Bush.     Just my opinion.

						      Here is the photojournal of a motorcycle enthusiast who took a joyride through Chernobyl dead zone.   urlLink http://www.kiddofspeed.com/default.htm       What an amazing story.  I can only begin the imagine what that must have been like.  It must have felt like there were thousands of ghosts watching his every move.  The thing that struck me the most was the apartments.  Every one of them holds a story of someone's life.  People who lived under Soviet rule in a dreary communist existance.  Living day to day in a what was most likely a drudgery job with no hope of ever having a better life, save the kind of "better" that family and friends bring.  THAT would be an experience to remember!!!     As someone who has been to the Soviet Union, this brought back a lot of memories.  This must be the closest thing to walking through a post nuclear apocolypse landscape, which is of course a goal of mine in life.  ;)

						   HA!  I managed to identify the Outbreak Monkey!!!  According to him, this is a particular strain of illness lasts weeks.  Thanks a whole purple-piss-load, Jason.  Remind me to hock a chunky one on your keyboard the next time I catch Black Malangie.  Fortunately, it has moved out of my head and settled into a nice annoying cough that will be sure to last well into the fall.  At least for once I can be the annoying one at work. One of the worst things about being sick (other than... well... being sick) is the weird thoughts that go through my mind.  Especially when I'm in that half awake half asleep dream state.  I'll be lying there worrying about a program I was working on at a previous job, thinking I'm somewhere out in public, while the theme song to Aqua Teen Hunger Force is running through my mind over and over again.  Ah, the joys of fever delirium.  Waking up with leg cramps is always a complete joy.  Plus the two days of soreness that follows do to over exertion.  You know, if only every voluntary muscle in our bodies could cramp up at once... that would be an easy way to stay in shape.   Then there's the fact that my doctor doens't have room for an appointment until a week from Wednesday.  Yeah, thanks, I'll either be cured or dead by then, doc.  Don't forget to charge me for bothering your useless secretary who's solution to any complaint about lack of service is to "feel free to find another doctor".  Yeah, I will be, don't worry.  Now onto the GOOD thing about being sick... Nyquil!  Nyquil has the best thing ever written on the side of its bottle... 180 proof!  It comes in two colors: Red and Green.  And it is the only thing in the world that tastes like red and green.  Plus they are the color of Christmas, and Nyquil makes a dandy eggnog.  I wonder what is in that other 10 non-alcohol percent...  A shot and a half of Nyquil upon waking up, and I'm right back asleep.  That way, I don't have to deal with the rest of the symptoms.  In fact, I'll bet that Nyquil doesn't even do anything other than knocking one out cold for six hours.  The last time I was sick, I went through two entire blissfullness-holding bottles of the sweet nectar of Shangri-La.  Slept almost four days straight.  Hardly knew I was sick at all.  *crying-sniff*  It was beautiful!  Oh well.  The fever is gone and I'm back on my feet.  *whew*

Sick as a dog and twice as ugly.  Until next time.

						   This is just completely depressing.  Now that  urlLink Kerry's people are swearing up and down  to the bastard who's the biggest offshorer of jobs in America, there is no reason for me not to support Bush for re-election.  Bush's stance on offshoring was the main issue that made me hesitant to vote for him.  On almost all other issues that matter to me, he was leagues ahead of Kerry.  Leave it to Kerry to flip-flop on my hot-button issue.

						   Now THIS is an idea who's time has come!!!  If Bush is serious about it, he will get my vote.  NICEVILLE, Fla. (Reuters) - President Bush (news - web sites) said on Tuesday that abolishing the U.S. income tax system and replacing it with a national sales tax was an idea worth considering.  "It's an interesting idea," Bush told an "Ask President Bush" campaign forum here. "You know, I'm not exactly sure how big the national sales tax is going to have to be, but it's the kind of interesting idea that we ought to explore seriously."  Republican economists who speak regularly to the White House have said that the Bush campaign has been mulling the idea of an overhaul of the tax code as part of an agenda for a second term should Bush win reelection.  Some lawmakers have floated ideas of simplifying the tax code by putting in place a "flat" income tax rate or a national sales tax. But those ideas have so far not gained much traction in Congress. Opponents say such a system would not be in the best interests of the poor and the middle class who would pay the same tax rate as the wealthy even though they have less disposable income.

						   You are in a concrete room. There is a steel pipe 25 centimeters in length cemented into the center of the concrete floor. The pipe protrudes about 15 centimiteres. A ping pong ball is dropped down the pipe. There is a fraction of a centimeter clearance around the ping pong ball and the pipe. Your task is to get the ping pong ball out of the steel pipe undamaged. The only items that are in the room with you are: a wooden ruler, a ball of string, a pocket mirror, a paper clip, and a small magnet. Since nothing else is allowed into the room, how could you get the plastic ping pong ball out of the steel pipe?  Go ahead! Prove your superior intellect! Solve this quandry!

						   Nothing big going on these days. Just dealing with bouts of pretty severe depression that the stupidest little things will trigger. Now, don't get me wrong, its no where NEAR the point to where my wife would ask "What color should we paint the walls?" and I would be tempted to answer "Give me my gun and I'll paint it 'My Brains!'" No, just that kind of depression where I want to go down into my cave, lock the door, and say the hell with the rest of the world.  Ugh. I can't wait 'til vacation time. I need a rest.  But anyway... On the way into the Hidden City, I tend to listen to the radio. One of the commercials is a group of kids screaming hyperly "LET'S GET SOME CHOCOLATELY OVALTINE!!!" to which the other kids scream "YEAH!!! OVALTINE!!!" Then the moms give them some, and they hyperly scream "MORE CHOCOLATELY OVALTINE PLEASE!!!" You know, I really have to question the mothers' decision to give these hyped up wired kids even more sugar and caffeen, considering they were probably jumping around like crazed gibbons in the first place.

						   Okay, so on my way in today, a terrible thing almost happened, but fortunately I was able to reach the emergency duct tape in my glove compartment and wrap my head before it exploded.  I'm sure you all know about the movie "Catwoman".  During an interview, Sharon Stone was asked why the movie did so badly.  Never mind that it had a STUPID plot, bad writing, etc.  Stone's reasoning as for why it did so bad was because there was no lesbian kiss in the movie between her and Halle Berry.  After all, she said, how could you have a movie with two people as hot as Stone and Berry and NOT have them kiss?  I don't know Sharon, please enlighten we poor stupid members of the unwashed masses with your infinite wisdom...  There was no lesbian kiss because George Bush is in the whitehouse.  And thus, the movie didn't do well.  In two related stories, there have been late monsoons in the south pacific because Stone's ego has pulled the moon out of orbit, and Hollywood has renamed the San Andreas Fault to Bush's Fault.  I don't understand it.  Hang on a second...*takes hit off bong*  You know, Stone might actually have a point.

						   Teresa Heinz-Kerry told a reporter to "shove it". Big deal. Cheney told a senator to go f*** himself and Bush called a reporter a major league a$$hole.  Personally, I just think it is humorous that moments before, she was talking about the tone in politics and how it had become "un-Pennsylvanian" and in some cases "un-American". Then a reporter asks her what she meant by un-American and she goes off saying "I didn't say that! I didn't say that! You are telling me something I didn't say, now shove it!" Ironic, as she did, in fact, just say that when speaking about the tone of public debate. Too funny!  At least if Kerry somehow manages to win the upcoming election, we'll have four years of her in the public spotlight. An interesting first lady for a change. Laura Bush is too tame, pretty much staying out of the public spotlight. Hillary Clinton was just too dangerous to be funny (not because I fear powerful women as many on the left has said, but because she was far too liberal in my opinion and she had too much of a hand crafting policy). Barbara Bush was pretty entertaining, as was Nancy Reagan, but both of them were still too subdued. Oh, the chance of hilarious First-Lady shenanigans.  The only thing that disturbs me of this is what I hear coming from several liberal sources. I've read in several blogs that people think the Republicans are "beating up on the girls". Hey, as far as I'm concerned, you enter the public arena in a politically active role, you are fair game. Some women seem to only want equal rights when it suits them. One thing I can't stand is inconsistency of thought. Saying they are allowed to spout off anything they want and then saying the other side shouldn't rebut them in response is like putting someone in a baseball game and saying that their runs count, but not their outs.  Sorry, but as far as I'm concerned, women who step into the political arena are subject to the same responses as men. Expect it and deal with it, or get off the stage*.  * note: The above commentary is merely an opinion in response, not an infringement on some poor victim's First Amendment rights.
