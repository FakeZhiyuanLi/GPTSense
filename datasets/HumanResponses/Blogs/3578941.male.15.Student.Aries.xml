      I am being paid $100 from my parents to scrape, primer, and paint one of our rental houses.  I just saw it as easy money for a trip i am taking in a little less than 2 weeks.  So i started workin on the house like a week ago, and i only have one half of one side done.  This is gunna take forever.  I have also put in about 6 hours scraping and primering, which means i still have to paint that whole side.  Some other news is a guy from my church called me yesterday wanting to know if i could help him bail hay (i think he is paying me) today somtime, he called like 2 hours ago saying we would do it at 5:30 p.m. if it was dry or tommorow at 2 if it was dry.  I sure hope it is wet today because then i could get one of my friends to help me tommorow seeing as today none of them could cause they all were doin stuff and if i dont do it today i just got screwed out of seeing spider man 2 which i really wanted to see and i think i am already screwed outa doin that cause the movie started like an hour ago and my bro and everybody eles left at 10 and i dont have to be there until 5:30 and they had to be back b4 4 because they had to work also...god damnit i just realized i got screwed!  Oh well, not the first time it's happened.  Nothing much has been happining here in small town p'burg except that i found out that my dad is driving 2 hours to missouri to smuggle some fireworkd back to us for the 4th YAY, i think it is supposed to be a suprise, so to my one and only reader chris, dont tell jake if u read this b4 u gotta work.  and to any other of my readers over the net, who dont know me but should, get to a bomb shelter quick because knowing me i am gunna blow up somtin big and mabey that might be the worls, or just illinois. and here are some lyrics to any guy who is having some girls troubles, i know i aint  So quiet. Another wasted night The television steals the conversation. Exhale. Another wasted breath again it goes unnoticed.  Please tell me you're just feeling tired, cause if it's more than that I fear that I might break. Out of touch.  Out of time. Please send me anything but signals that are mixed, cause I can't read your rolling eyes. Out of touch.  Are we out of time?  Closed lipped another goodnight kiss  is robbed of all its passion.  Your thrill  another time to slack  has left me feeling empty  Please tell me you're just feeling tired, cause if it's more than that I feel that I might break. Out of touch.  Out of time Please send me anything but signals that are mixed, cause I can't read your rolling eyes. Out of touch.  Are we out of time?  I'll wait until tomorrow. Maybe you'll feel better then, maybe we'll be better then. So what's another day when I can't bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you? This mood of yours is temporary. It seems worth the wait to see you smile again. Out of the corner of my eye won't be the only way you're looking at me then.  So quiet. Another wasted night the television steals the conversation. Exhale. Another wasted breath again it goes unnoticed.  Dashboard Confesional-Again I go unnoticed

      i fuckin hate my brother.  today he locked me outside on our deck and then told me to sit down and he would let me inside, then after i didnt sit down he got all bitchy and tried to make me sit down.  i just pushed him outa the way and came inside and he kept tryin to push me back outside, so i pushed back and then he was kinda half standing up but not really and he just started to twirl around with fist tryin to hit me, it didnt work so i push him again.  after that i went to shut the door thinkin it was over and he pushed me and my head hit the wall, i just turned around and punched him in his sholder and pushed him, then i ducked because he came back up twirling around like a gay balerina tryin to hit me again. we finally stoped and i went to get on the comp.  he then started bitchin about how i was "grounded" from the comp and i coldnt get on. i just told him i wasnt so he grabed the phone and acted like he was calling my mom, which i didnt know he was just acting, so after he got back he said she said i was grounded and to take away the mouse so i couldnt play. i got really pissed off and really called my mom and she said he didnt call and i wasnt grounded.  so, for those of you who know me, this is one of the many reasons i hate my brother and wish i could kill him.  the only problem is that i am very relaxed and i never stay really pissed off at people and i havent held a grudge against him, but whenever we start to fight again i remember all that stuff and get super pissed off. enough of my ranting and raving i am gunna write in here what i have done in the past few days. you know what? i dont remember any of that stuff so i am just gunna write stuff that i remember.  this morning i went to church and came home and played x-box. thats all i remember. and by the way, i was just wondering who all reads this, so if u read it just leave a comment, i dont know if you can if u aint on blogger but just leave a comment with ur name, ty

      Summer vacation is great, i mean i slpet in until 11:30 (earlier than normal) and than i did nothing for 3 hours.  It was great, until i tried to get my brother outa bed to go tubbing with chris and his cousin.  Finally i got him out and then he decided to make a call to try to get more people to go, which was dan.  After about an hour or less of talking to dan on and off the phone he finally could come over.  During that time me and my bro filled up the intertube and then he left to pick up dan.  Now if you don't know my brother you would think that it would take about 10 minutes to drive into town and then back here, but no, my brother drives like an old granny on weed.  He will take forever to get to someplace when you are not with him but then when u are with him he will go around sharp turns goin 60.  So while i was waiting for him to get back chris and his cousin, ashley, came over.  So i just took them down to the dock with the intertube and was going back to the house to call dan's house to see were they were, they were inside changing.  So finaly we went tubbing, now what i mean by we went tubbing is they went tubbing and i watched because i aint gunna go tubbing for a while.  After chris and ashley went home me, my bro, and dan watched the simpsons and then chris called and we started talkin about going to see a movie.  we decided to see Hellboy.  all in all it was a good movie, i advise you to see it if u havent.  now i am to here, the lyrics i am posting is a song about masterbation that chris let us hear on the way to the movie, so here it is have fun with it   I sit around and watch the tube but nothing's on I change the channels for an hour or two Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit I'm sick of all the same old shit In a house with unlocked doors And I'm fucking lazy  Bite my lip and close my eyes Take me away to paradise I'm so damn bored I'm going blind And I smell like shit  Peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving I sure as hell can't do it by myself I'm feeling like a dog in heat Barred indoors from the summer street I locked the door to my own cell And I lost the key  Bite my lip and close my eyes Take me away to paradise I'm so damn bored I'm going blind And I smell like shit  I got no motivation Where is my motivation No time for the motivation Smoking my inspiration  I sit around and watch the phone but no one's calling Call me pathetic call me what you will (screw ya) My mother says to get a job But she don't like the one she's got When masturbation's lost it's fun You're fucking breaking  Bite my lip and close my eyes Take me away to paradise I'm so damn bored I'm going blind And loneliness has to suffice Bite my lip and close my eyes I'm slipping away to paradise Some say "Quit or I'll go blind" But it's just a myth  Longview-Greenday

      Lets see, nothing much has been goin on in the last few days.  I really gotta think hard (which i dont like to do) to think of what i have done in the past few days.  I even just now forgot what today was, man i love summer vacation.  Oh ya, about that thing were i am thinking about what happened the past few days, it aint gunna happen, so i will talk about today.  I woke up at like 12:15 p.m and i felt kinda sick like i was yesterday so i just got on the computer and screwed aroung for a while on the internet.  My mom got home at like 2 from this class thingy she's takin in jacksinville and at 4 we took chris to work and picked up our car from the shop and i scraped paint off of our rental house for a half'n'hour.  Now i will explain all of those things, we had to take chris to work today because apparently he got in a fight with his dad about him taking a buncha shit from him for the past few years and he was damn tired of it, so his dad said he couldn't drive, so we took him to work and he said he would try to find a ride home tonight but if he didnt he would walk home.  Now for those of you who don't know were he lives, he lives out here at the lake like close to my house, that is about 2 miles from DQ were he works.  I have had to walk home from school, which is further, and it is not that fun, it does give you a lot of time to think about things, but it is 11 o'clock at night and he might be walking home.  Now to the car, about 2 or 3 or 4 days ago the car started making some funny noise and we didnt know what they were, so my dad took the car to Knous and they fixed it...for 215 fucking dolars. o well.  Then to the rental house.  My dad is paying me and my bro $100 each to scrape the paint off of the house and then paint it, all before July 6th.  So every once in a while i go down there and scrape some paint off. and then that leads to now and a bit before now.  my brother came upstairs all pissy and wanted to know if i turned off the X-box like 5 hours ago, i said yes and then he got all pissy because he hadn't saved his game before he left for work.  Either way it would have happened because i played Halo while he was gone and if you leave the X-box on for more than 6 hours it will turn off and he found out about it like 7 hours later so i aint really feeling sorry for him.  and now i am gunna put some lyrics on here for the way i feel right now, i am also gunna do somtin different than most people and put on the tabs for the song, if you dont know what tabs are, they are a cheap way of learning a song on guitar, and yes i play guitar, i think i play well but some may beg to differ so here they are  Linkin Park-Breaking the Habit Memories consume like opening the wound  I'm picking me apart again You all assume, I'm safe here in my room Unless I try to start again  I don't want to be the one the battles always choose 'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused  I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I know it's not alright So I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit Tonight...  Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door I try to catch my breath again I hurt much more, than any time before I have no options left again  I don't want to be the one the battles always choose 'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused  I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit Tonight…  I'll paint it on the walls 'Cause I'm the one at fault I'll never fight again And this is how it ends  I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream But now I have some clarity  To show you what I mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit Tonight...  e--0--5--3--2-- B-------------- G-------------- play 6x D-------------- A-------------- E--------------  e--0-----3--2--0--5--3--2-- B-----4-------------------- G-------------------------- D-------------------------- A-------------------------- E--------------------------  Verse: second guitar e----------------------------- B----------------------------- G----------------------------- D--9--9-12--9-9--9--9-10--9-9- play through out song A----------------------------- E-----------------------------  Chord names:     Em  C   Bm  D   G  D/F# e---x---x---2---2---3---2--- B---x---1---3---1---3---0--- G---x---x---4---2---4---0--- D---2---2---4---x---5---2--- A---2---3---2---0---5---3--- E---x---3---x---0---3---x---  these tabs are short because Linkin Park is more about rapping than about shredding on the guitar i am gunna go to bed pretty soon so i gunna post agian in a few days or tommorow night or when ever

      Well lets see what has happened since the last time I posted something, since it said I went to see Eurotrip at Chris's I think that was Thursday night and I posted that on Friday morning.  So I did almost nothing on Saturday morning Because my dad went to a thing and I didn't have to do chores.  That afternoon my brother got his friend Dan to come over and then took like 3 hours trying to get some of my friends to come over to go tubing and since I don't like to go tubing so I watched my friends Seth and Zach get thrown off of an intertube going almost 30 m.p.h. so that was fun.  After that we had to make a mad dash to go to like 3 peoples houses to get X-box and X-box stuff so we could connect 2 X-boxes together with two TVs but that failed miserably because we didn't have a power cord for one of them.  We just stayed up all night playing Halo and Brute Force and may I say Seth gets really personal and edgy and angry and stuff when he is playing a game, so some parts were fun and other parts would really piss me off, but all in all if was fun.  This morning I left a note to my parents asking if my friends and I could sleep in and not go to church if I read the bible for an hour, it worked.  So I started to read the Bible and found an interesting passage that I am going to share with all of my readers (all 2 of them):  And I saw the Lamb break open the sixth seal.  There was a violent earthquake, and the sun became black like coarse black cloth, and the moon turned completely red like blood.  The stars fell down to earth, like unripe figs falling from the tree when a strong wind shakes it.  The sky disappeared like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.  Then the kings of earth, the rulers and the military chiefs, the rich and the poor, and all other people, slave and free, hid themselves in caves and under rocks on the mountains.  They called out to the mountains and to the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the eyes of the one who sits on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb!  The terrible day of their anger is here, and who can stand up against it?" Revelation 6:12-17  After that I had dinner with my family and my grandma and then we watched 50 first dates (for the second time, for me) and that brings me to now.  I have been thinking of having a Halo tournament or party so if you want in, just talk to me and I will give you all the info.  Thats all.

      All right everybody, last night I saw Eurotrip at Chris's house and I heard the best song ever in that movie, Scotty Doesn't Know-Lustra.  The best part of this song was they would play it all throughout the movie but in diferent languages, and by the way, WATCH IT, it is funny.  So here are the lyrics:  Scotty doesn't know that Fiona and me do it in my van every Sunday. She tells him she's in church, but she doesn't go. Still she's on her knees And Scotty doesn't know.   Oh, Scotty doesn't know so don't tell Scotty Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know so don't tell Scotty  Fiona says she's out shopping, But she's under me and I'm not stopping.  Cause Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know  Scotty doesn't know so don't tell Scotty Scotty doesn't know So don't tell Scotty  I can't believe he's so trusting While I'm right behind you thrusting Fiona's got him on the phone And she's trying not to moan It's a three-way call And he knows nothing Nothing  Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know  don't tell Scotty Cause Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know So don't tell Scotty We'll put on a show Everyone will go Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know  The parking lot Why not? It's so cool when you're on top. His front lawn  In the snow Life is so hard Cause Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know  I did her on his birthday...  Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know  Scotty doesn't know so don't tell Scotty Scotty doesn't know  Scotty will know Scotty has to know Scotty's gotta know Gonna tell Scotty  Gonna tell him myself Scotty has to know Scotty has to know Scotty has to Scotty has to  Scotty has to go  Scotty doesn't know (Repeat 6X) Scotty doesn't Scotty doesn't  Scotty doesn't know  Scotty doesn't know (Repeat 8X) Scotty's gotta go  Lustra-Scotty Doesn't Know

      As you might have guessed I have been grounded for the past week.  It wasn't that bad because I had some family over and like two nights ago I spent the night at seth's house and he spending the night here tonight so I am gunna have something to do so yay.  Also I have been planning some pranks for a mission trip called Passport I am going to in 3 1/2 weeks.  It's pretty fun and every year me, my brother, and normally kyle stark plan a few pranks to pull on our youth leader Pat.  Last year we tried to feed him a piece of cake full of exlax, he didn't eat it :( but we did hit him with a few water balloons, so if you have any pranks just leave them as a comment and I will read them and might use them.  Uhhh I haven't really done anything the past week and except I went to Chronicals of Riddick (dunno how to spell it) with my brother, chris, ryan, and eric heyen.  It was a great movie, I advise ya'll to see it.  Well I am going to surf the web while waiting for seth to get here, so ttyl I, right stuff when ever I can.

      The reason I am writing this is because I am watching a UFO show on Discovery channel and I am pretty convinced now that there are...others.  I have always wondered what that small moving light was in the sky or that weird little man in my dreams who kept telling me to look in the sky at midnight on the 3rd day of the 3rd month of the 3rd year, well guess what?  I missed it, yes I did not look at the sky last year on March third, but then I wonder.  What if the weird little man meant the 3rd day after I saw him and then the third month after I saw him and then the third year, but who knows.  He might be talking about the third day after I realized that there were others and that on the third month or you know it might be the third day after I get stoned and see him again...hah hah I am just joking with you...he was a tall man.

      Today has been a boring day, I woke up and have done nothing since.  My aunt and uncle are driving somewhere north to see a friend.  Oh yah, my uncle is giving me $5 for each present I wrap for him for my aunts birthday, so I am getting $20 today or tomorrow or sometime!  I don't think it's a good idea for me to write everyday because it's going to get very boring, so I am going to write every other day or every 3 days or whenever I feel like it sooooooo I'm outa here.

      srry i havnt written for a while, i have been away from illinois for the past two weeks so i am here to tell u about my trip to atlanta. it was a long long long trip stuck in a van with my brother and my mother and my father.we went to south carolina first and stayed at my aunt and uncle's house.&nbsp;my cousin was there and i think he is 17 but he had to work the first night we got there and before i woke up the next day and then that night. we had fun playin x-box in his room. he also loved family guy just like me and had over 8 hours of it downloaded onto his computer. the day after we got there when he was workin his sister, my cousin, got back from canada that night and all we just ate dinner and then she had to find clothes for the funeral because her suitcase got lost. but the next day we drove two hours to atlanta for my uncles funeral. we got there and went straight to the church for the funeral. after the funeral we went to a friend of my uncles house for dinner (everybody did). after lunch we went to our hotel and basicly swan for the hole day and then that night we had our hole family in the loby yellin drinkin and playin cards. it was pretty funny because when we ordered pizza we got 18! it was funny seeing the delivery guy make 5 trips back to the delivery car. the next day we went to my cousin's organic farm that he is startin with a few of his friends.&nbsp;we just dug some holes and put up a fence. then we drove home. btw it is like a 12 or 14 hour drive and we drove it staight both times.   I am putting a few quotes from the funeral in my uncles memory.   My cousin Katie, uncle's daughter, got up and said this, "I know two things, my father is in heaven and...I am daddy's little girl" I just like this quote.&nbsp; This one is from one of my uncles friend, he was helping him messure cut and put up siding, he asked him which side of the tape messure he wanted to use, the Alabama side or the Georgia side? Later he said that the Gerogia side had little numbers on it and the Alabama side just had a hook on one side.    &nbsp;  How many people does it take to put up a nativity set?&nbsp; 19 presbyterians and 1 lutheren.    &nbsp;   Ronald Edward Godbey

      my dad, my bro, my uncle, and i were watching butterfly effect tonight when in the middle of it my other uncle called and told my dad the arrangements for the memorial survice, what i cant get is how my dad is so accetabal of his youngest brothers death. i mean he has gone along iwht his life like nothin is different, hes just done a lot more stuff (prob to keep his mind off of it) and been at my gmas house for the past two days, and me on the other hand, i have only seen him like 3 or 4 times in my life that i can remember and i am just a mess about him dieng. like my dad spent probably about 20 years of his life with him and i have only spent like 5 weeks with him, but my dad hasnt shed a tear that i have seen and i have. i mean, when somebody dies i cant see how they can just get over it, that person will never be seen again, you will think of all the times that you would have seen them and all the things you have done with them and realize that none of it will ever happen again. also he has a twin and i will always say "what are ron, do and harry doin this summer" and then i will realize that ron is no longer here with us and wont be ever again. i just hope that he is in a better place now. but what must be the worst part of this situation is that his daughter, my cousin, is in germany and has been there for the past year or less and has no idea that her father has died. she also hasnt seen him in the past year and hasnt been able to say goodbye or anything. but anyways, my aunt and uncle came up this afternoon, from wisconsin,&nbsp;after they had taken days off for the funeral and everything and my other aunt and, maybe my&nbsp;uncle, from montana are flying to georiga for the memorial witch is this saturday. on a brighter note, i had a great time at passport. i only broke one thing and spent $50. there were abuncha hot chicks in my bible study group but as those of you who know me i am not a very good "ladys man". like with this one chick, i thought she was just staring at me and always walking up right next to me during all of the places we would go to so i thought that she had the hots for me. now as i think about it, she probably did the first two days when she hadnt known me or seen me do anything. or mabey if i would have talked to her or not been myself we might've done somtin that week or somtin like that. and btw if you are reading this ashleigh, it was you, and if you are thinking "i never stared at him or followed him around" it was probably just my mind thinking that you were and hopping that if i said it enough it would be true. there were also some other hot chicks, i wont name em but the impresions that they gave me were, one was sporty kinda, one was a great kick ass singer, one had bug eyes, and there were more but since i dont have a picture in front of me i cant think of them or thier faces, so if you were one of the lucky girls who i said and who are reading this (whitch is probably none of them) you should feel lucky that the GREAT AUSTIN thinks u are hot...omfg i am too full of myself. but any ways, i got to know the people from my church group a lot better and i got the hots for one of them and i think she had the hots for me, unles it was just my mind again, and her name was... OH NO, my comp is messing up, it just deleted that hole section on me telling you who it was! to wrap this up i just want yall to pray for me and my family like a said b4, after this experiance, it might just bring me closer or further away from God, hopefully closer but i cant tell the future

      i just got back today from louisville and may i say it was kick ass.&nbsp; i aint gunna get into all of the details cause there are too many and i aint in a good mood right now.&nbsp; there was a lot of hot chicks and kool guys that i made friends with.&nbsp; but i am in a bad mood now because right after we got to the church and got all of our crap into the van my mom told me and my bro that our uncle died this morning, we dont know what it was from yet though. that was a downer and one of the reasons that i aint gunna get into all of this stuff today, so plz keep his family in your prarys and mine too. thank you

      hey ya'll i just thought up of somtin that i am gunna do in my blog, and that is give movies raitings. so from now one when ever i see a movie i will try to give it a raiting, out of 10, and mabey briefly explain the movie or why i like it, so here is the first one:  Stuck on You: I will give this movie a 5 because it only delt with one main problem which was the twins decision to be cut in half or not and it was one of the situations that you just wanted to jump into the screen and beat the shit out of the people for being soooooo stupid and not doing the obvious thing that would be so much easier. *****  plz leave a comment on this post that has to do with this raiting or with the next movie.  The Perfect Score: I will give this movie a 8 because it was halarious;y funny but some parts would drag on a little bit too long.  Overall it was one of the teen movies with actual teen situations that a thirty year old man would think we would have. Plus there is a really really hot gothic chick that any one who would see this movie would want to fuck very soon. I mean the first time you see her in the movie just makes you want to fuck her. ********  leave a god damn comment or i will kill you

DEAL WITH IT YOU MUTHA FUCKERS! i'll be back on friday night and will probably write about this on saturday sometime. the thing that i am goin to in louisville is call Passport, it is a mission project camp thingy that is kick ass fun and i wish i could go every 2 weeks but i cant:( yes my friends it is that fun, so i get to wake up really early tommorow morning to leave at 8 o'clock and i am just hopping that it wont rain that week. so cya all on saturday and btw justin after saying our bands name, Damned Nation, in my head it hasnt sounded as good as i thought it would, and my parents "dont approve" of it and would like me to change it. so if any of ya'll have a good name for a punk/punk rock/rock/ska band leave a comment with it and we might just use it if it is good enough cya

      i havent written in this for a while so theres a lotta stuff to catch up on.  on saturday night there were supposed to be fireworks out here at the lake but it was raining all day and they didnt know what the weather was gunna be like that night so they possponed them for the next night so we didnt do much on friday.  on sunday night there was joey, dan, justin, me, my brother, and chris watchin fireworks at the end of our dock.  half way through joey asked chris why everybody eles was so far away from the point were tehy were fireing them off from and we were only 50 feet away, chris simply aswered "because they are smart".  the fireworks show was pretty good and before that me and justin were rockin out on our patio.  part of the way through us playin my mom called from a party she was at on the other side of the lake and she told us to be quiet because they could here us all the way over there!  of course we didnt quiet down we just kept playin for a while.  back o the fireworks, there was only 2 problems with em, 1. the ediot kid who was firing them off on one side, shoot them rigtht towards us and we were about to return fire but we saw our parents were a bit close and they told us not to shoot any off until they got home so we didnt 2. one of the boxes that the fireworks were in fell over and started to shoot across the lake and would skid across towards boats. yesterday my dad had they day off so we went to springfield to super wall-mart to get some stuff and i had to get some supplies for Passport which is a mission trip i am goin on next week.  i got a 24 pack of normal mountain dew and 2 12 packs of livewire because they had dew u points on them. i also got 250 water ballons and 3 cans of silly string. i thinks its gunna be pretty fun. then last night my mom got a call from our youth leader Pat saying that there were 3 openings so if we had any friends that wanted to go they could go free of charge. i called up seth and he said he would think about it. i called him back today at like 12 and he was still asleep so i gunna call him back after i finish this. today i havent really done alot so i aint gunna say anything bout today. peace

      as you now if have been reading this, my dad got some fireworks and he let us shoot some off tonight.  most of them didnt make any noise at all, they would just shoot up and make lights so, they were pretty cool but not my favorite.  me and justin started to make our band today, we decided on a name but i forgot it already. me justin and hopefully mike and chris will be in it. we decided that i gunna play lead guitar, justin is playin rythym guitar, mike will play keyboard and hopefully sing(he's also gettin a guitar soon), and then chris, i think he told me he was gettin a guitar a while ago and i just have to convince him to get a bass so we can have a bass player, but ya its just gunna be a cool high school band and who knows, we might get like awsome and make million$ :). so far i think we playin rock and punk or somtin like that. nothin much is goin on here, i baled hay yesterday and boy was that fun! not really, it was hard work but the guy i work for is kinda rich i think and pays generously, very gernerous. and we gotta ride the ATV and that was fun, my first time drivin. i am a pro. jeez i dont know what to write in here, i not really good at these journal things unless i write every night and then i'll just have too many and they wont be good and if i dont i wont remember everything, so o well, i just gunna continue what i am doin, so here are ur daily dose of lyrics  Chorus:  With a long range weapon or suicide bomb  A wicked mind is a weapon of mass destruction  Whether your soar-away Sun or BBC1 Disinformation is a weapon of mass destruction  You’re called a Caucasian or a poor Asian  Racism is a weapon of mass destruction  Whether inflation or globalization  Fear is a weapon of mass destruction   My dad came into my room holding his hat  I knew he was leaving,  he sat on my bed told me some facts  Son, I have a duty calling on me  You and your sister be brave my little soldier  And don't forget all I told you  You’re the mister of the house now remember this  And when you wake up in the morning give your momma a kiss  Then I had to say goodbye  In the morning I woke momma with a kiss on each eyelid  Even though I'm only a kid,  Certain things can't be hid  Momma grabbed me  Held me like I was made of gold  But why he left her in the story’s untold  I said, momma it will be al right  When daddy comes home, tonight   Chorus  With a long range weapon or suicide bomb  A wicked mind is a weapon of mass destruction  Whether your soar-away Sun or BBC1 Disinformation is a weapon of mass destruction  You’re called a Caucasian or a poor Asian  Racism is a weapon of mass destruction  Whether inflation or globalization  Fear is a weapon of mass destruction   Whether Halliburton, Enron or anyone  Greed is a weapon of mass destruction We need to find courage, overcome  Inaction is a weapon of mass destruction (3x)   My story stops here, let’s be clear  This scenario is happening everywhere  And you ain't going to nirvana or fatwana  You're coming right back here to live out your karma  With even more drama than previously, seriously  Just how many centuries have we been  Waiting for someone else to make us free  And we refuse to see  That people overseas suffer just like we  Bad leadership, and egos, unfettered and free  Who feed on the people they're supposed to lead  I don't need these people to pray away  For the Lord to make it all straight  There’s only now to do it right  ’Cause I don't want your daddy to leave your home tonight   Chorus  With a long range weapon or suicide bomb  A wicked mind is a weapon of mass destruction  Whether your soar-away Sun or BBC1 Disinformation is a weapon of mass destruction  You’re called a Caucasian or a poor Asian  Racism is a weapon of mass destruction  Whether inflation or globalization  Fear is a weapon of mass destruction   Faithless-Mass Destruction

      i thought i would update this again and think back upon this summer...a lot of things have happened this summer, i started this blog, i went to passport, my lawn mower broke like 5 times and still is, my uncle died, i went to georgia, im going to go to montana, my cousin is getting maried and i just found out today that my dog might be going blind. OH OH OH i went to see harold and kumar go to white castle on sunday night with chris, jake, and sarah(one of chris's friends from DQ) and that movie was HALARIOUS!!! After the movie i was craving two things, 1. get high 2.GO TO WHITE CASTLE mmmm those small burgers looked soooo good, im getting hungry just thinking about them. today i started to mow and the lawn mower fell apart again so i called my dad to tell him about it and he said to go to R and H to get the part, i just got back and i found it but it doesnt fit exactly right but if i put some glue in it, it might. I just wanted to say that today's weather is like really really depressing. its just all cold and cloudy and it remids me of school weather. god damn the school, there making everything depressing. i just cant wait to go t montana tommrow and get with all my family and just have a good time with them and forget about all of the problems im having here and just have fun. i just hope that my dad doesnt put my dog to sleep while we are gone like he did with our cats like 12 or 13 years ago. i just dont think i could think what it would be like w/o buddy around, i mean we've had him for the past 13 years. i guess thats all for today.

      hey yall, its been a while since i updated this and i am sorry for that, i just havent felt like doin it for a while and i still dont feel like doin it now, but i thought i might as well or i'd have to do it later and then i would have to remember too much stuff and my brain might explode...its happened. i cant remember the stuff that has happened in the past week (from my recent brain explosion) so i might just say all the stuff i do remember like, me and my mom went school shoppin on monday i think and we only went to supper wal-mart and sams, btw i hate super wally world cause i dont know were the hell anything is unlike the normal one which i coulda gottin all my stuff that day w/o hafting to go back in but my mom wouldnt take me to any of them so i had to go again tuesday. it actually turned out better because since we got so much stuff at hot topic they had a sale were if you bought more thatn 105 bucks, i think, u get like 37 bucks of free stuff (2 t-shirts) so i got another one and jake got another one and i got all the stampy thingys on my frequent buyer card so now i get a %15 discount next time i go yay! uhh didnt do much on wednesday and yesterday i was just waitin around for a guy to call me about bailing hay, but he didnt. so i thought he would today...he didnt. i guess he might've told me that we are doin it at the end of next week not at the end of this week. so i might need to talk to him on sunday when i see him at church and tell him that i gunna be in montana next week and i wont be able to do it then. uh my mom had her garage sale this week and i had to make a sign for it...which i just remembered i might want to take it down tommorow...o ya, but anyways whild i was making it, i wanted to do somtin cool with the spray paint but while i was doin it i cut my finger with some sicsors so i just stoped. but l8er on chris came over and we talked for a bit and just sat outside. o ya, i 4got to tell yall i startin to use my dads old camera and learnin how to take cool pix like of me shootin myself, but not in the way u think, a way that is much cooler. anywho, i gues thats it. i try to update this more often but no gurentees and when school rolls around the corner i will definatly do it a lot more. gtg
