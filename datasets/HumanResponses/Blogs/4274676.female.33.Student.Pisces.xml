      ...to say that I am pissed with dating and men in general. Right now--I am so sick of dating and the shyte connect there-with.

      ...and here I am.

It's only about Michael right now. If you don't know...Michael is my first love--that has somehow found his way back into my life again. (Okay--I'll admit it--I found him.)

I always wondered just how my life would have been if I had a chance to be with him instead of my ex-husband (Nutso!). Would it have been better? Worse?

He's got me thinkin' and wonderin' what it could have been?--He's also got me thinkin' about what it could be if we were to get married. I am sooooo afraid that if we get married, that I will end up droppin' out of school...fat....pregnant....and miserable.  I am also sooooo afraid that if we get married I will end up cukoo with happiness, pleased, excited, cherished, and loved to the utmost. Both extremes got me messed up right now.....It's all due to that damned Eldean---more on him later.....

      I realized after a brief discussion on my "other" favorite site   urlLink www.Nappturality.com   that women--Not just African American/Black women, but women in general have been doing some messed up shyte to themselves for thousands of years--all in the name of beauty. We must start taking care of self and loving self--before we can try to love anyone else. That's starts with the cessation of self-inflicted pain (relaxers & perms) all in favor of "Beauty". 

Then again, you know what?--I guess I am a hypocrite--as I am constantly talkin' about how I want a boob job. I don't know....but am I any different from any other woman?  I mean--I want to change on thing about me, but yet refuse to change another.....

Hummmmm.....be back later--as today seems as if it is only going to get more "cute" for me......
