      I told my mom when she did finally get home. She seemed sort of concerned. Something was up and I didn’t like it one bit. She called Colonel Henderson and invited him over for dinner next week. All that week I counted off the days until Friday night when the Mrs. And Mrs. Henderson would come over for dinner. People coming over to my house was never good news. It meant I had to clean up for a week in advance and keep it clean for a week. I had to get all cleaned up and be on my best manners. Normally it was just bad because most of the time it was some guy coming over to talk about my dad for hours.                 I went out and acted normal and played baseball but there was something in the back of my mind the whole time. Something kept nagging me, something about the way the Colonel had said he would like to see my mother. There was something very nerve racking about the whole thing. I kept it in the back of my mind though. It may seems stupid and overreacting to you but I swear I did not sleep more then an hour Thursday night. Then Friday night at six sharp the doorbell rang.                 I had to entertain the guests and get them something to drink like a good little boy while my mother finished all the little details to the dinner she had been preparing all day. Something was bugging her too it was probably all this. These types of dinners are bad for everyone if you ask me, I never got why grownups did it.                 “These mashed potatoes are great. Where did you say you got this wine?” Same old pleasantries. That was pretty much the deepest dinner conversation went that night. I said nothing I got the feeling pretty soon that this dinner really had nothing to do with me. You’d think I’d be relieved. I finished dinner and cleared everyone’s places and went into the kitchen with Mrs. Henderson who insisted on helping with the dishes. It was very annoying, mom had assumed the role of dad and I had been stuck with the women’s work. Mrs. Henderson  was nice about it and didn’t make me actually wash the dishes just hand them to her. It’s not that I don’t normally wash dishes but it’s not the type of thing I normally do at these formal type things. I was twelve years old, honestly.                 Mrs. Henderson seem to take her time. She was real loud about it too, humming and doing stuff like that. I knew it was to cover up the muffled voices coming from the other room. I wanted to hear desperately but even if she wasn’t humming I still couldn’t hear Colonel Henderson and my mom. So I just gave up and went on washing.                 Pretty soon Mr. and Mrs. Henderson were getting up, thanking us for dinner and all the usual stuff. We made some small talk for about a minute before they left. Mother was being very cordigal and everything until they left she suddenly looked very solemn and almost sad. She said nothing though and I knew better then to ask her what Colonel Henderson had said. She announced she was tired and went to bed. It was nearly eight. I stayed up for about ten minutes then I too went to bed even though the sun was just setting. I’m pretty sure neither of us slept at all that night.                 I had always felt bad for my mother. Her parents had both died a year after I had been born. She had always planned to have four children. I guess with my father always being gone and all it hadn’t really worked out. She had been pregnant but miscarriaged when I was about four. It had been a big blow to me because I had always wanted a little brother. Then since my dad was shot down I swear she hasn’t slept a full night. I guess for now I’m all that she has and she can’t stand that she has to leave me during the day and go to work. I know all the sacrifices she’s made for me but sometimes I think she holds more in then she ought to.                  The summer wound on and the days got longer and then shorter. Even when they were shrinking they still seemed too long. Odd for a kid to hate summer right? I never liked it. It was hot, I barely ever saw my mother and the only kid I had to play with was Fred. I grew tried of Fred but he never seemed to tire of me. He was like a loyal dog. A Jack Terrier, that’s what he was, always excitedly nipping at my heels. When I spoke of the coast and all the wonders over the ridge he’d join in too talking about when his dad got home and stuff like that.                 I discouraged him as much as possible. There is nothing I hated to see more then some kid with high hopes. I’d tell him his father was rotting in some ditch in Vietnam. I’d tell him his mother could never afford to move. I’d tell him all about the ugly truths of the world. You could see his spirits sink and I felt a little better. I’d always believed it was best to recognize the reality and people who liked to believe what they wanted frustrated me.                 One day he said for about the millionth time that he’d come with me. I said in my annoyance “No you wont, when I move I’ll probably never see you again, you’ll go to school on the base and I’ll go to school out there.” This really discouraged him and he disappeared. I was shocked by this. He just disappeared and I don’t mean I didn’t see him again that afternoon, I didn’t see him again that week, nor did anyone else on the block, or his mom. He ran away.                 I’ll tell you at the time it didn’t bother me very much. The hours of wondering the streets wore me down though. When I can’t get into the house, Fred’s not around and none of the other boys will play with me I wonder the street. I like seeing all the houses. They all look almost identical, they are all painted the same, the same cars are seen over and over colors varying and the shrubberies even resemble each other. Still I find something in them interesting. I would look at those houses and see the family. Many of them I had no idea who lived there, I had never seen them before even though Heaven’s Peak wasn’t that big. It made me sick to live in the neighborhood and visualizing the life inside made it slightly easier. Everything was the same, just as it should be and neat. Half the things were fake because nothing really grew in the desert.                 It is pretty sad now that I look back on it that I had to do that. My mom probably would have given me the keys to the house had she known how bad it was. I admit I played a key part in making the kids reject me but it hurt no less. It tore me up inside that my only friend was Fred and how lucky I felt simply to be able to play for ten minutes with the other boys. It tore me up that I was all alone in this town. It was like a sane boy living in an insane asylum although I didn’t see it that way at the time. The whole situation hurt. The houses became repetitive after a while and I began to miss Fred. I felt I could take it no more but somehow I did walking up those same lonely streets for one more day barely holding back the tears of rage and resentment.                 It was not long after that that my mom would come home and give me reprieve from my depression. For a night I would forget about all of it. Dad, Fred, the other boys, Heaven’s Peak and the town over the mountains. I would watch TV with her and eat dinner and talk. We talked a lot. We talked mostly about what I would do tomorrow (all lies) or in two years, or what I wanted to be when I grew up. I talked about what we would do when Dad got home but she never seemed to have much input. Mostly we would talk about the future though. It was wonderful.                 Then I’d go to bed and very shortly after she would too. She would find sleep immediately. She always did. I think she was so exhausted from work, cleaning and cooking that she could barely stay awake for our conversations. She did though and that I will always remember. I would not sleep. Night was when I got depressed. I would stare at my ceiling unable to sleep for hours, I’d blame it on the heat or all the sugar I had eaten even when I ate none. Still I would sit there alone with my mind. I would think of the most terrible things, never the good things. Sometimes I’d wake up with tears in my eyes but I didn’t know why. I was afraid mom would hear me so often I slept with my face in the pillow. It was no way to live but at the time it was all I knew.                 It was that week that I sat on the couch with my mom. It was then that we were phoned. It was just at nightfall. Fred had been missing for nearly three weeks now and I was crazy with guilt and depression although no one knew it. I doubt if even I was aware of it. My mother answered as she always did. She ran over in excitement and turned on the TV.                 “Daddy’s coming home.” She said excitedly.                 I smiled despite my best efforts to stifle it. She sat next to me on the couch and we were glued to that screen. When she turned it on the door on a plane was just opening. It had been on the news for a while now and things were just starting to happen. I can’t easily describe the elation that I felt, it was like nothing most humans have ever experienced. That I sat watching as those ragged men came off the plane. We watched each man. That wasn’t dad, nor he, nor he, we counted each on off almost certain next it would be dad, I had seen pictures of him and I knew exactly what he looked like. The ravages of Vietnam couldn’t change the look in my father’s eyes, that I knew.                 We watched them all come off. Until it was announced that the last man would be coming out shortly. We watched as that last man came out of that door. I looked at the face. It wasn’t dad. You can’t describe that feeling either. What now? I thought. None of them were dad. I sat there in silence next to my mother, neither of us dared speak. We were both thinking the same thing.                 I got up from the couch suddenly determined. My mother was in too much shock to notice this. I was angry. I knew something was wrong, it couldn’t be, it couldn’t be. In the back of my mind it all made sense though. The hushed voices of my mother and Colonel Henderson. The strange looks of all the officers that lived around here and would have known my dad. I knew what I had to do. I would leave, this place, I no longer saw any point in sticking around.                 I went to the garage and got my bike. I was careful not to scratch the car as I led the bike to the door and opened it. I rolled my bike down the driveway and took off down the street. I left the garage door wide open.                 It was still dusk. The beautiful soft hues of blue and gray lingered on the horizon as the first stars came out and the street lights blinked on simultaneously. I tore down the street trying to get away from the orderly lawns as fast as possible. I raced past Colonel Henderson’s house and Fred’s and everyone’s leaving them behind. I would ride as far as I could this night. I didn’t care that I brought no water or no food, I could find them out in the wilderness. I would become like and Indian and hunt game and ride from watering hole to watering hole. I didn’t care about anything.                 It didn’t take long to leave Heaven’s Peak behind. I never looked back. Had I looked back I was afraid I would have stopped. Nothing installs reason in boys like civilization. It was not a good thing. I wanted to ride away and never come back, all the yellow lights from bedrooms of sons who knew their fathers were on the way home only would make me miss my mother. It was too late, I was a man now and I was ready to carve a chunk of life out for myself or so I thought.                 I rode up that desert road all night. The earth around me was flat and dark. Coyotes howled somewhere nearby into the night’s sky and all the bugs that I had come to hate were out. The desert looked almost pretty at night, almost. My legs grew sore but I pushed on determined to reach that ridge before mom noticed that I was missing and went looking for me. I rode until the road became a path. Then I rode until I reached the foot of the “mountains.” Then I rode along the base of the ridges until I found the easiest place to climb.                 At this point both my tires were flat and my bike was no longer shiny. I was covered in dust from head to toe and my eyes were bloodshot from the winds. I felt sick and tired but I didn’t let it slow me down. A fire now burned inside of me with such ferocity that I could not make it yield. So I pushed on farther and farther. I climbed up the ridge often on all fours until my hands bled and were caked with mud. I climbed as fast as I could and ran as much as I walked.                 I watched as I got closer and closer until I was only feet away from the point I had hiked with my troop. I looked over my shoulder to Heaven’s Peak, which was now just a glowing site in the distance. The sky was changing color in the east. It was turning into a gray as the sun was beginning its ascension into the sky. I quickened my pace reaching farther and moving quicker. I could see the top coming. I was now in a race with the sun. I moved fast. I finally collapsed on the top.                 I turned my head back to the east breathing heavily on all fours. My whole body was sore, I was exhausted mentally and physically but it was all right because I had beat the sun. The first sliver peaked over the eastward mountains. I smiled.                 It was only now that I turned and looked over the mountains that I had long dreamed of crossing. I looked west and what I saw brought pure horror and gave me a sick feeling in my gut. A housing development. It was one identical to Heaven’s Peak. Everything was the same. It was waking up to dawn as I was sure Heaven’s Peak was doing miles away. I was disappointed beyond description of words. I looked at it as twenty of the same cars drove down the road to work at the Air Force Base, as the first lights in the house went on and the street lights faded out. The only word I could speak in my dry mouth was “No.”                 A car was driving down the dirt path from Heaven’s Peak’s direction. It was my mother’s car. She had come for me. I sat down on a rock and waited. She would take me back I knew. I did not know what would happen after that and I didn’t care anymore. I just sat there.                 I won’t tell you what became of Fred or what would become of me. I don’t think you’d like it. I know I didn’t. I will tell you this if Fred had been waiting for me when I got home, I would have told him I had seen the coast, and it was beautiful.   :Once again feedback whether or not you feel I'll like it will be greatly appreciated. It's been a while since I've seen this one it has been in computer "gathering dust" for a while and there are probably numerous grammar errors and a few typos.  I'll have more of this type later:

      In reality the title itself is an error. As I think we all know we did not actually elect him in 2000 based on the popular vote which I think most people can agree would be the best system now that the masses are well educated. Beyond this I do not want rehash and squabbles left over from four years ago. Although I was only twelve at the time I was very much involved in politics which is hard for many people to take seriously as I am sure my present age is as well but despite of that it's true I was very interested in politics. I remember I was pro-Bradley in the primaries and really after those I didn't care as long as Bush didn't get elected. In my naive ways I thought because most of my friends who knew little about politics wanted Gore to win it was a done deal. I was very much upset when Bush did win and I think it was in those following months around age thirteen that I realized that I was in fact a democrat. Before I just wanted who ever I liked (in a political sense) to win. Now I did not inherit my parents opinions in case your wondering as is often the case at my age, my mother has voted socialist in the past and most recently has been a proponent of Nader but will probably vote Kerry this year only for the sake of keeping Bush away from another four years, my father also is anti-Bush although hardly vocal on the subject. I would most likely describe my father as a liberal Republican despite this. It's hard to tell since he rarely talks about it. Now back to the point. In my opinion the reasons not to reelect Bush are of much more importance then exactly where in Indochina Kerry was in on December 24th, 1968. People talk about questions of integrity and I ask you where exactly are the weapons of mass destruction. If you are of the opinion that it was an intelligence failure and that in fact it was not at all Bush's fault you must not forget exactly who had the say so in going to war. The facts were before Bush and exactly what those facts were are still up to debate but we know he chose to go to war, that choice, should, whether or not you think it is fair, be one of the major deciding factors in how you will cast your ballot. He made the wrong choice and we now have 1,000 dead American boys, many teenagers, many opposed and the unspoken of thousands wounded, so many of which are missing legs, arms and living day-by-day on machines. What do we have to show for their pain and suffering? A freer but more dangerous country? Is it worth it when you consider Libya, Syria, Iran, North Korea, China, the many African and South American countries and others under siege from terrorists like Indonesia, Philippines, Spain, Russia and so on. If we are in this business to do the right thing then why are we not in those countries or does freedom carry no more then a 1,000 body bag price tag? And don't let the failures of Iraq and inability to capture Saddam Hussein distract the so willingly distracted public from the failings here at home. So far his tax cuts, while it was nice I think for everyone to get some money back a couple years ago, have done little to boost the economy. You can blame it on the Clinton administration but the facts are that the effects of the economy don't take four years to be seen. The Clinton administration was the most successful wars and civil rights aside since the creation of the United States. This is a fact, you can look up the numbers, it is not because of Bush or Reagan, it is not that the Republicans can claim economic success for whoever they feel like. Again we have been left high and dry as Bush's job growth projections fall dreadfully short and the poor are still just as poor and with less jobs. As for the outsourcing of jobs Bush cannot be blamed, but he can be blamed for taking no action. It is time that we ask ourselves exactly what has he done in the four years he's had. I'm not going to tell you that Bush is behind the shameless Swift Boat Veterans For Truth adds anymore then I would believe Kerry is behind Moveon.org's adds and neither am I a proponent for the 527 adds coming off the air. It is called freedom of speech and I love it. It has taken a most disturbing turn for the worse in recent years with the Patriot Act, a step closer to Nazi Germany and the nationalism it embraced, a small step granted but a step none the least. Back to the 527 adds I do believe that there is some investigation due into Bush's record. It came up in the last election and in the four or five years it's been since it was brought up Bush has failed to bring up a single bit of evidence suggesting he was there during the time of his reported AOL. Kerry has been defending his own record valiantly as well as people who served with him, not registered Republicans that were only in-country at the same time as him. I would like to see Bush defend himself, not because I am at all sure he can't but because I think that if he has nothing to hide he should (by the way I also agree that Kerry should release his entire record, although he has already released about half of it). I think there is enough questions about Bush to keep everyone going for a long time. And his dodging of these questions makes me unable to watch much of his few press conference now. I was watching the one today and once again he did not specifically denounce the Swift Boat Veterans For Truth though John McCain (whom I have a great deal of respect for as a politician, person and veteran) denounced them having taking flak from them during his own primaries in 2000. So when you vote in November remember to consider four more years of recession, fighting and limiting of freedoms under the guise of terrorism control, a issue that is often talked about and rarely acted on.

      If you drive far enough into the Californian desert you will find Heaven’s Peak a large development of family housing primarily sold to Air Force families. I’m not sure if it still exists but it doesn’t really matter because I have no interest in seeing it again. Heaven’s Peak is a nice name but the road that goes up the center is aptly titled Tumbleweed. The road was there before the development so it could not have been changed. Heaven’s Peak was supposed to be this little piece of heaven carved out of the dry lake beds that made the Californian Desert home to the Air Force. Let me tell you it was nothing like heaven to me.                 I grew up the son of a pilot. My dad was the best damned pilot in the Air Force or so I was told by my mother and several years later but many high ranking officers. My father was a Wild Weasel which unfortunately for me meant he shipped off to Vietnam early in the war when I was only six. Before that he was gone a lot so it’s safe to say I was raised by my mother. I don’t know when but probably not even a year had gone by before my father got himself in a major dogfight over the skies of North Vietnam. He was always the wily one I have been told and the reports were confusing for a few days but in the end it turned out his entire squadron made it back, except for him.                 He flew with a man named Barry Knowles from Brentwood, Kentucky. Fred Knowles lived just across the street from me for the two years I had lived in Heaven’s Peak. Fred Knowles was three years younger then me and in my eyes a baby. We were told that my father was in a Vietnamese POW camp somewhere deep in the recesses of North Vietnam. Barry how ever was found floating in some little river near the border looking like he had been beaten to death. He was killed in ejection.                 I believe I was thirteen that summer and Fred must have been nine then. It was 1972 and the war was ending. Everyday I would watch people’s daddy’s come home from the war or here and there. They’d all come out and happily greet each other and I’d watch from my room sickened with a combination or rage, hate and sadness. Normally I’d cry for an hour or so afterwards but nobody knew that, I was too old to cry in six years I’d go to college and four years after that I’d become an officer in the Air Force and not long after that I’d fly to Vietnam and kill some of them. I didn’t realize as a twelve-year-old what was happening in that far off country. I didn’t realize the war was ending, I heard people talking but I didn’t believe it.                 That summer was in many ways the end of my childhood. Every summer we’d go out with all the other kids and run around and ride our bikes and wait for the ice cream man to drive all the way out to our little suburb. You see Heaven’s peak was only a housing development, there were no stores and no places to go really unless you had a car. So we’d ride to this kid’s house then this kid planning to play baseball down at the park but by the time we got there half the kids would have dropped off to do other things so we’d only have enough kids to fill the infield. Then we’d go swimming in the pond. I don’t think the pond was created with swimming in mind but kids will swim where ever they can. So we’d swim in that cement pond. Something about Heaven’s Peak always bothered me but I never could say what it was.                 Days like those when there just wasn’t enough kids to play and it was too hot to just play catch me and Fred would sneak off all by ourselves. Sometimes we’d walk out into the desert or go to Fred’s house where it was always air-conditioned and his mom always seemed to be sleeping. Sometimes we’d just sit in one of the small lush parks the developer had put in. The grass was always wet and the dirt smelled of fertilizer because they had to water and fertilize it all constantly or it would all turn brown like the rest of the desert. Although I wouldn’t ever admit it then or for quite some years the boys never got along with me, hell they never liked me. I was always insulting them or telling them that their old man was full of bull. I was a little rude.                 I don’t really know why Fred hung around me. He was too little for my group of friends but getting to old for his group of friends. All of the boys my age ostracized him and told him to go home or play with George Jablonski or one of the other boys his age. He would never listen, always the stubborn one like his father. I was rude to him too but like some faithful dog he never walked away he’d just sink low to avoid more of my verbal blows and follow.                 “I hear that the gooks are gonna have to release the prisoners soon. Then my dad will come home and we can move to somewhere else on the coast or something.”                 “Yeah! And when my dad comes home…”                 “You’re dad’s dead.”                 “He might be a POW.”                 “No they found his body and everything. Remember?”                 “Carl said that it was just a bunch of bricks in my daddy’s coffin.”                 “He was probably right but that’s just cause they couldn’t find enough of your daddy to bury.”                 “Yeah maybe…” He said looking at a blade of grass that he was tearing to pieces. Once he was done with that one he plucked another out of his lawn and started to dissect it.                 “I can’t wait till he comes home. We can move to the other side of those mountains, that’s where my mom says the ocean is. I can get a surfboard and spend all my time at the beach like my cousin.”                 “Yeah I can go with you.”                 “No you’re mom doesn’t want to leave she can’t get out of bed until after lunchtime let alone move to the coast.”                “That’s cause of her night-job, she works the late shift down town. They pay her more to do it.”                 “Maybe.” I said remembering all the empty bottles of gin that’s always lying around. She liked her martinis. “One of these days though, I’m going to get up in the early morning and ride my bike all the way to them mountains then all day I’ll climb until I reach the other side. I can’t wait to see the ocean.”                 “I can go with you.” We both looked across the road to the mountains that were really just some ridges a couple of miles away. They were no mountains and would probably only take a couple of hours to get to the top but for lack of a better word I called them mountains. Some days I figured they might as well be mountains because there is no way I’m getting over them.                 “What do you think it’s like over there?” asked Fred squinting tearing another blade of grass apart strand by strand.                  “Nothing like this. The towns are real, not like this, there’s ice cream trucks, policemen walking around, lots of stores, all kinds of stores. Then there are restaurants so when you feel like it you can go out and get food where ever you want, if you want hamburgers you can have a hamburger and dad can have his steak and mom can too. There’s lots of schools and if you don’t like the kids that live by you then you can ride your bike a few blocks down to your friends from school. The schools are bigger too, they’re more then fifteen to each class, there’s at least forty and there’s at least two schools. There’s a football team and everything. The parks have real trees not palm trees or this wet grass.”                 “I like the parks here.”                 “Then you better stay here because over there everything’s real. The houses don’t all look the same and not everyone is in the Air Force. They have real career days with real doctors, firemen and businessmen. Plus when your teacher asks you what you want to be when you grow up all the boys don’t say F-4 pilot. That’s not even the half of it. At the top of those mountains you can see clear across the town to the golden beaches with this blue waters. You can even smell it.”                 “How far is it to there?” asked Fred excitedly.                 “To the beach? Maybe fifty miles. It’s almost twenty to the mountains and from their top you could probably almost see about thirty miles. Maybe it’s more like forty, I’m not sure. But to drive it will take hours because you have to go through the pass. I remember when I was really little I drove there but I never got to see the ocean. It took about ten hours to drive there.”                 “We’ll never get there then.”                 “Sure we will, we don’t have to go around to the pass why we can climb straight over. I went hiking over there when I was in the boy scouts, it wasn’t too hard we made it about a hundred feet from the top but the scout master wouldn’t let us go to the top because it got dangerous to climb. If we ride our bikes real fast on the road and we hike real fast we could probably make it as long as we left just before sunup.”                 “When are we going to do this?” He asked.                 “I told you when they release my dad. Then after that we can move there once my dad come home.”                 “Yeah me too.”                 “I told you Fred you’re dad’s dead, he has been for years. That’s why your mom’s a drunk.”                 “She is not a drunk!”                 “Is too!”                 “Well your dad is a bastard!”                 I punched him in the face as hard as I could. I jumped on his chest and started drilling in his face. I could see some blood I didn’t care. Some guy was yelling at me. I ignored him. Next thing I knew this big guy wearing a flight suit had me by the elbow and was damn near lifting me off my feet. I started swinging at him but who was I kidding I wasn’t hitting him.                 “Hey! Knock that off Tommy!”                 “My name’s Tom!”                 “Do you want me to tell your mom about this?” asked the big guy in the flight suit.                 “No Colonel.”                 “What’s wrong with you Tom? Hitting a boy like that? You ought to be ashamed of yourself, he’s half your size.”                 “He called my dad a bastard, Colonel.”                 “Why don’t you come with me Fred, I’ll get you cleaned up. You too Tom.” He wasn’t angry anymore even Fred noticed this. Fred was afraid he was in trouble now. I was glad he was afraid.                 We followed Colonel Henderson over to his house which was one of the bigger houses in Heaven’s Peak. His son was graduating this year and being that his son was pretty independent and no longer needed his help Colonel Henderson had been taking it on himself to watch after the neighborhood kids when their dads were gone. He had been busy.                 “Honey,” He called as he walked in and dropped his briefcase to the ground. “Could you get something cold to drink for Tommy and Fred?”                 “Alright.” She called from the kitchen where she was washing dishes from lunch. He went off into a room down the hall leaving the two of us to sit on his couch. Fred was careful to make sure that none of the blood running from his nose fell on the couch. We could hear the Colonel searching through the medicine closet.                 “Oh honey, watch it! This couch is brand new.” Said Mrs. Henderson as she put down the tray with three glasses full of ice and lemonade on the coffee table. The couch probably wasn’t brand new but the Henderson’s had this house where everything always looked brand new even their cars. She grabbed some paper towels and put them under his nose. “Hold these there, where is David?”                 Then Mr. Henderson appeared with some gauze, band aids and rubbing alcohol. “Alright Fred, what’s bleeding?”                 “My nose.” He said cheerfully. He was satisfied with all the attention he was getting. “Oh, well then, just keep those paper towels there and tip your head back.” He turned around to return all the things to his medicine closet seeming a little disappointed he didn’t get to use the stuff he had gone out and bought when they moved in and had rarely used since.                 “I’ll get you some Kleenex honey.” Said Mrs. Henderson a little dismayed with our dirty clothes from rolling in the grass.                 Mr. Henderson returned around the time Mrs. Henderson did. He thanked her and dismissed her back to the kitchen.                 “What was this all about?” He asked picking up his glass and inviting us to do likewise.                 “He called my dad a…”                 “Remember where you are Tommy.”                 “He called my dad a name.”                 “Why did you do that Fred?”                 “He said my dad was dead and my mom was a drunk.”                 “Oh, I see where this is coming from.” He looked pretty nervous. “If you want to Fred you can just finish up your drink and if you want to go outside and play.” No sooner had he said this then Fred got up thanked him and ran out the door presumably to go home.                 “Has your mother talked to you about your father’s status?”                 “What do you mean?”                 “You can go home but if you would please tell your mother that I would like to have a word with her.”                 “She’s at work now.”                 “When does she get home?”                 “At three.”                 “Tell her then.”                 “Alright.”                 “And Tommy, stay out of fights. I don’t want to see that again. What would your father say?”            “Yes sir. Thank you for the lemonade.” He nodded and I too was dismissed. So I walked outside. Fred had gone home he was no where to be seen. My house was just a block away but I couldn’t go home. It was locked my mom didn’t want me home alone. She was afraid of what I would do so I started walking up and down the street.    :This is the end of part one, I know it's kind of long but any feedback would be appreciated, I wrote this one a while ago, not my strongest but it's going to be my first, part two will come soon. The dialogue may be a little weak it used to be a problem of mine but I hope you like it:

       Okay, I know I'm not the only person worried about the modern state of music. That's why "they" created alternative music, it's in the name get it, haha funny. But alternative is now a source of some of the problems. I'd like to talk about a couple bands namely Modest Mouse and Postal Service and to a lesser extent the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, the Killers, the Strokes, Coldplay, and the Hot Hot Heat. These are perhaps the modern day REM's, Pixies, Nirvanas and the like. The bands that revolutionized the radio in the late eighties and early nineties. Not to say that the Pixies sold out or that Nirvana ever changed but honestly Nirvana's brand of music was ready and packaged to sell. If you are a fan of Indie or psuedo-indie or as it is also called "lo-fi" then you probably know these bands and if you are a fan of mainstream music and older then ten you probably know the rest. Don't worry if you don't know all those names though you should, they've all had their share of airplay. They say that rock is coming back, which is in my opinion a good thing, anything that takes hits at country and rap is good. I would not listen to half the stuff that's selling if I was paid to. Actually that's not true, it's just a old expression, I think the more accurate statement is I would not listen to that music  unless  I was paid to. The problem lies in those trendy bass/volume pushing choruses where the singer starts screaming and all the young teens get pumped up and start dancing. It is an element found in every popular song, for the most part though it is very hard to discern if it exists at all in Modest Mouse's "Float On" which is not one of my personal favorites, a little to bland, a little too pop. Now if you listen to many bands namely Pedro the Lion's "It's Hard to Find a Friend" and a number of other albums you'll find that said chorus is all but entirely absent from the whole album. Other albums like Modest Mouse's sublime "Lonesome Crowded West" will blend the almost-choruses into the rest of the song and confuse you to which part is the chorus with steady drumming, crude vocals and random timing. After you've heard a couple mainstream rock songs it seems that you've heard them all, at least the chorus which to the mainstream rocker is the "heart and soul" of their songs. Which leaves their songs peicemeal. If you are at all tired of rock songs after four or five times of hearing them, you may in fact only be bored with the chorus that seems to occupy half of the song and always have felt lackluster about the other verses and riffs. If you ever feel this way or perhaps are bored with the mainstream music I would recommend the Postal Service which you've probably heard of but more importantly Ben Gibbard of the Postal Service's other band Death Cab for Cutie. Also the earlier Modest Mouse albums namely "Lonesome Crowded West" but you have to ease into the Mouse, listen a few times before you pass judgement and look beyond the vocals soon it will be something you love, then when you're confident in the Mouse look into "A Long Drive For Someone With Nothing to Think About", yes it's a long title that was the point.  And maybe if you have a passing fancy or maybe you're really into emo but looking for something else to listen to pick up the Anniversary's 2000 album "Designing a Nervous Breakdown" the synthezier in it is very sutble and great. If you're into sort of soft rock with great consistancy Pedro the Lion is a great band with the aforementioned album "It's Hard to Find a Friend" and also their new, much more popular album "Pedro the Lion" now to forewarn you they are Christian but they don't take the shotgun approach to it and they do cuss. Their lyrics are quite meaningful in those two albums and Jesus is rarely mentioned if you are a true Christain then that's a plus right? Other good bands include: Built to Spill, Neutral Milk Hotel, Rilo Kiley (female lead vocals),  the Good Life, the Decemberists and Iron and Wine. That should get you started. However when you know all these great underground bands and maybe you see one of them on Mtv with one of your punk friends, do the indie community a favor and don't call them indie, the last thing they want is that word catching on with the Mtv zombies. I mean sure promote their music, spread the word, but don't call it indie when it makes it big, you and I will know at heart it still is but it's better that the rest of the world doesn't.

       I guess  everyone is talking about this subject or were, they've moved on to better stuff but it's hardly been solved so I want to throw my two cents in. First of all I am not gay but I support gay marriage for one very simple reason, I support the US Constitution. I find it hard to believe that the President who's job in part is to uphold the US Constitution would support a gay marriage ban. Does it not say in the Constitution all men are created equal? So who gets the right to decide that that does not apply to gay marriages but only to marriage between a man and a woman. In a religious aspect of course a church has the right to keep their marriage practices however they like, that's not the issue, it is the state's marriage. Why does there even have to be a separate name for it? These so called "unions" mock the couples and make marriage like a secret club only accessible to people of a certain creed. This is a practice long denounced by the US government and any elected politician who supports ought to be stripped of their title. I don't mean this literally of course, that is just as bad as voting for a gay marriage ban. I also think that it is quite convenient that the moment this thing fell through and did not get the support President Bush hoped for it was neatly swept under the rug. It is time that people stop forgetting an issue once the twenty-four hour news channels stop covering it ten times a day. What is it replaced with? The Peterson case, the Hacking case, the Jackson case? Things of such little relevance. This is an election year and it is time that people start focusing on the issues at hand and not at these little media distractions and war records. The facts are that the records show Kerry winning his medals, wounded three times, in Vietnam and they show Bush absent much of the time from the Air National Guard back home in the states and failing to take a drug test. Those are the facts, get over it and stop worrying, I say that to Democrats too although it should be kept in mind that this man sent us into two countries to fight never having done so himself, which does not make him a bad man but certainly should be taken into account. I would recommend watching the Daily Show, they bring up everything and criticize everyone, the way a real news show ought to be.

        Needless to say to anyone who cares modern Literature is lacking. Not only in my opinion are most writers more lazy but the ones that are dedicated see themselves too much as artists and get a little too weird. I mean why write a good meaningful novel when Gresham can pump out something long, and articulate in a fifth of the time and sell a hundred times as many copies, at least. You can't make people want to read emotionally draining books but you could hope for their sake that they still have a soul, an inkling of human emotion that might compel them to read a real novel. Now the point here is that if the airplane riding public doesn't care about literature and you do, then unfortunately the responsibility to promote it lies on you. The idea is not new, independent literature has been around for a long time, there are even a few organizations for it, but they are surely few and small. Now since most people who read these things are in some way writers it might be good to do something about it. If the inspiration strikes you please get involved or at least for godsake just read Catcher in the Rye or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest or something of value.

        Bored. I guess that's why you do this, either you have something really important to say, which means you probably don't, or your bored. I'm bored with lots of stuff, I'm building up some goddamn repetoire of stuff to be bored with. I've read a few blogs, they're alright, I guess I could start off my first one with politics, that's always an easy one and who else but President George Bush could make politics so damn interesting. I guess an idiot can do lots of stuff when he puts his mind to it. I've been looking around for combat footage of the war in Iraq and besides seeing hundreds of APC's and tanks rumbling about picturesque villages and soldiers with M16s propped up in the crook of their elbow there hasn't been much. What do you expect when you can't film coffins though? Out of the hundreds of reporters embedded with those units in the beginning you'd think there'd be some real footages besides audio of shots being fired while the camera ducks behind a wall. And I still hear the words combat correspondent thrown around, it should be enough to make Robert Capa turn over in his grave. If there's people with enough balls to shoot the guns then surely there's some who will stand by and brave all the legal nonsense thrown up by the US government. But then I suppose all those people have long sold their souls to businesses that can copyright and back it up with lawyers. Don't think I'm opposed to capitalism, it's the best system there is, it just sucks, often and hard. Not that that's in anyways Bush fault, no I blame the patriot act on him and Dick Cheney. 911 had all the democrats rolling over and taking it from the republicans, and for once we all see exactly what a nonpartisan government can do, totally screw it all up. I say partisan is a good thing, throw as much partisanism into the mix, and make about five groups, and have them fight it out on the senate floor and don't let them come out until they're done and mostly happy. No one wants everyone to be happy, then you're in trouble. So I advocate the creation of a third party, not the Green Party or any other gun nut, tree hugging party. So get to that. And since you can't tell I say that with a certain degree of sarcasm, a third party now seems about as realistic as birds cleaning up their own droppings.      Anybody know anything about combat footage from Iraq or Bush, or anybody know anything... atall...please.
