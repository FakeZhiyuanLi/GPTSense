      Geez, my car is still at the dealership, waiting for a new rim. A rim that supposedly isn't in production any more. So how they're gonna get a new one, I don't know.    Friday, went out with friends Kelly and Carrie to a dance.  The dance was a dud, mostly older folks, so after 45 min. we met up with Kelly's friend Vonda over at Powerhouse Pub in Folsom.  Listened to live music until 1 am.  A good time was had by all.

      Just talked to my realtor, he told me that my 4-plex purchase closed yesterday! He left me a message on my cell, but I don't always check it. So now I own a 4-plex.   *gulp* I think I'm spending money faster than I'm making it.    So here at work I'm exploring getting the validator package to work in the java Struts framework.  I'm getting zero results.  I'm missing something basic.  So what else is new.  *yawn* Man, I'm tired.  FInally fell asleep at 2 am, woke up at 5 am. ?!?!  whatever. At least I can go home early today and take a nap, since I came in around 6:30 this morning.

      Quite an interesting weekend. Nathan started swimming without his water wings (!) He's not so afraid of going underwater anymore.  That's pretty cool.  Friday night, as we were swimming at the lodge it started hailing, while the sun was shining. Kinda wierd. The wedding Saturday was very nice.  Nice to see old co-workers, like Dave Jemmott and Fernando Chilvarguer.  Nathan was bored as hell of course.  Now Sunday... wow... Driving down the hill, somewhere after Truckee, the car swerved a bit, like a gust of wind had hit.  WTF?!?  Then the left-rear tire starts to thump, creating a strong vibration that rattles the car.  I thought it was a flat.  So I pull up to a gas station in Colfax and.. The mag wheel cap was blown off, 3 of 5 lug nuts were GONE, and 2 of the lugs had snapped off... 2 more lug nuts and I would've lost the tire while driving down I-80 at 70mph.  So Nathan and I hung out in a strip mall parking lot in Colfax for 3 hours. Waiting for tow truck, waiting while the tow truck driver tried to fix the wheel so he wouldn't have to tow us 40 miles. God bless Jed the tow truck driver, working hard on that tire so I wouldn't have to pay him a commission! He get's 30% of the mileage.  But after workin on the tire for an hour, he had to give up, it was too far gone, so I had him tow us down the hill to Suburban Ford at Madison and I-80. So the car is at the dealership. The service guy called and said they'll have to wait a week for a new rim, supposedly they're really rare.  woohoo.

      Tired. Slept about 3 hours last night. ugh   At least I'm all packed and ready to go.  Hopefully I don't drive off a cliff on my way up there. I'm off to wire funds to title for closing on the 4-plex.

      Man, I'm so frustrated with this java Struts stuff right now!!  grrrrr.  I'm stuck on a problem where a .jsp form is supposed to work a certain way, the same way it works in another app, and I can't make it work that way.  It's getting pretty old.  *yawn*  One problem is that this certain behavior involves changing a configuration file that requires the app to be re-started to take effect. struts-config.xml, to be specific.  stop start login test edit. stop start login test edit. stop start login test edit.   woohoo, what fun!  After work, gonna go pick up my new mustang from the local ford dealership service department.  Got LoJack installed, interior upholstery treatment, and fixed a problem with interior lights not working (map light, vanity mirror lights).  Can't wait for tomorrow.. put the top down and jam up the hill to Tahoe!!  I'm wondering if there might be a problem with the rear differential.. the car doesn't seem to be going as fast as the speedometer indicates.  It has 18" wheels, so I'm thinking that possibly the wheels were added aftermarket.  One of these days I'll have a buddy benchmark with me, make sure speedometer is correct.  Ok, break over, back to work. ugh.

       Today is the first day of the rest of my life.  It's also the first day of my web log.  I'm not sure what I'm going to put here yet, or how often I'll update. I'm looking forward to going to Tahoe tomorrow with my son, Nathan, for the weekend.  We'll be staying at a timeshare in King's Beach (north shore).

      Wow, haven't posted in almost a month!  sheesh Went to Cayucous the end of last month, had a great time with family. Best.vacation.ever.  Nathan turned 5 on June 28. I turned 36 on July 1. Ugh, I'm almost over the hill.   Here's a cool trick: go to google, type in "Weapons of Mass Destruction", think click the "I feel lucky" button.  Look closely at the resulting web page.

      man i suck. I'm not much of a blogger, apparently.  I'm getting laid off at the end of the year, and pretty excited about it.  I'll have 6 months severance, so maybe I can do some more Mr. Mom stuff with ma boy like I did in October. (took a month of unpaid leave).  "Nate is great! He's better than a chocolate cake!"

       I scheduled a plumber to come by, had a whole mess of work for them to do, like installing a new kitchen sink/faucet/disposal/water purifier, back patio faucet blah blah blah  So I leave work early, wait for 2 hours yesterday afternoon. Get a call about 4:30, almost 5 maybe.&nbsp; The dispatcher doesn't know where her guys are, can they come on Tuesday, between 9 and noon?&nbsp; I say "I'm self-employed, and charge per-hour, between 9 and noon is too broad, I've already lost money, plus I have a meeting at 10." She says "how about between 8 and 10". What a doofus! The plumber needs time to actually do the job doesn't he?!&nbsp; grr I explain, and we arrive at a 7-9 am window.&nbsp; Well surprise surprise, no show.&nbsp; I get a call at 9:30, they're wondering what time would be good for me. "You were supposed to be here this morning" "yeah, we had truck problems" "You've got more problems than that, and you're not getting my business"

      Had fun on a date last night. Just went out for frozen yogurt with Jennifer. (Hi Jennifer!) What a cutie! I love it when you never have a lack of things to talk about and before you know it the time has flown by.  Well, I guess  I    never  lack topics of conversation, since I tend to dominate them. Must watch that, tut tut. Anyway, the traditional 1 hour first meeting ended up being more like 2 hours.  That's a good thing, right?  Tonight I'm going for beer-thirty with my buddy Thad, then my church group's Thurs. nite swim & bible-study.  I think Mikey let slip yesterday that they may have a little surprise bday thing planned for me.  That's cool. If not, that's cool too. After 30, I didn't care so much about bdays anymore. I mean look, I don't even care enough to spell it out!  But maybe I should care. I should care that I'm one year closer to my moldy grave. Well, cremation for me actually, I'm already a card-carrying member of Neptune Society.  (psst, that means I'm being cremated and it's all paid for and everything)

      And it's back to work after a 3-day weekend.  Spent Saturday and Sunday at Folsom Lake jet skiing. I'm a bit sore and sunburned. Aww, isn't life rough.  Please sir, can I have another?   Tonight a friend is treating me to dinner at Il Fornaio, my favorite, for my b-day. Man, I'm milkin' this b-day thing aren't I?!

      ...is what I imagine everyone else puts in their blogs. But ya know what? Not me.  Nuh uh. Just whatever pops into my not-so-little ol' head.  That's right, I'm a non-conformist. Must be why I'm a libertarian.

      Saw  Spiderman 2  last night. My mom treated me and my son for my birthday.  But, oddly, she didn't have any cash to treat the family (my 2 bro's were there also) to goodies and, surprise, my brothers didn't have any cash on them, so I forked over $40.   As for the movie, I thought it was as good as the first one. Except that Pete took off his mask too much. As we were walking out, my 6-year-old boy (who just had  his  b-day too) says to me "Can we come back again tomorrow?" Guess he liked it!  In case you didn't notice, I'm making a bunch of posts in one day to give the illusion that I update my blog frequently. Is it working?

      Well, today I just got my check from the  sale  of said 4plex!  Turned it around in a year. I'd had negative monthly cash flow all year.  Just shows to go ya, kiddies, make sure to put more than 20% down, or don't be such a softie and raise your rents!  Anyway, the property value appreciated almost 50%, so I'm a happy camper. And happy to be rid of that hefty mortgage payment, almost 3x the amount of the payment for my condo! Whew,  that's  a weight off my shoulders!

      A couple of people have actually looked at my weblog recently, and I hadn't updated it in almost a year. Or more?!  Oh, the shame.

      Note to self. To populate a VB.NET DataGrid from a DataSet, you first have to Fill the dataset at runtime.  Thusly:  SqlDataAdapter1.Fill(DataSet1) Took me waay to long to figure that out!
