So stress now,i really dun know how to do a perfect fren...i really care the fren,but it's also give me suffer all the way.Aisk,look at the fren i care that one,i feel that,jus like a mirror,i seeing myself(the pass one) on my fren too...we're both too care abt fren,always will suspect something abt fren.Now i jus understand that,give too much of care,also will let others ppl so much of stress...Not only ourself...  Actually i really dun know wat i'm talking abt now,jus feeling so confuse now.I'm jus jump out from "the friend" problem,i never expert this problem will happen on me.Now i finally understand that how much the stress my frens been endure b4...b'coz i'm giving too much of care.Now is turn my fren give me too much of care now...it's time to let me suffer...But i can know that,i really care my fren,sometimes really dun know how to let her/him know how i feel.i think i'm avoiding to face the problem now...God...pls leave me alone...

      Jus watching the video taken from my sister forward email abt the korean--Mr.kim beheaded video.It's quite shock and the image is move around in my brain.How come...?Why the iraqi militant group can be cruel like a beast....?I cant hear the voice from the video as well,but i can hear the korean guy is keep screaming until he become mute.They keep cutting his head as a tree like that,that image is very very very cruel and bloodcurdling.  Five hooded men stood behind Kim, one reading a statement and gesturing with his right hand. Another captor had a big knife slipped in his belt.One of the masked men said the message was intended for the Korean people.But i cant hear it clearly wat they talking abt...finish read the statement,Mr.kim was beheaded by these five hooded men.After that,i hear they shouted something like the majlis spell....  Why human can doing such of unbelievable and ridiculous thing?They dun hav any guilty when they doing such a cruel thing?I'm still remember that cruel image in my brain...It's always floating around my head.Aisk.....this world is turning cold....I think i will curse all the iraqi militant group,hope that someday they will also beheaded by someone...to try the beheaded feeling~!So angry...

      It's supposed to be summer here in Manchester. But it's freezzzzing today. Rain and rain and strong strong wind. Horrible weather :(  Today is a day of doing nothing at my summer workplace again. One of the gals in my group fell sick and didn't come today. So left three of us doing nothing together. It's not too bad today coz I finally feel like talking to 'em. hehe... very 'dao' of me rite? Gota know a lot of things from these three local Britons though. & I finally got to know what does W.C. stands for.  They thought the Muslims rules are very scary. In that, the Malays HAVE to be a muslim and they HAVE to eat halal food.   Some kind of cultural exchange huh... haha...

      hellluuuu.... anyone there? &nbsp; is everyone so busy to update&nbsp;our tiny winny&nbsp;blog, or are u guys just waiting for new entries? &nbsp; well, to keep everyone going again (i hope), here's a little update bout wanz... &nbsp; I'm supposed to end my summer vacation job last friday but my contract got extended for another 2 weeks,&nbsp;PLUS a lot of&nbsp;overtime opportunties.&nbsp;It might even&nbsp;be extended again after the 2 weeks. I need more pounds (in monetary terms) for my travelling in Sept, so I have 'unprinciplely' accepted the offer since it's rather an easy job.&nbsp;BUuuut... its very time-consuming. Which means&nbsp;i have no time to do my dissertation now. So the only thing I can do is to sacrifice my beauty sleep.  &nbsp; *sob sob*

      Today is: 1 Aug 2004 Submission Date: 10 Sept 2004 Binding Service: 5 days No. of days left: 31 days  Yes, this is another one of my whinning sessions. Beginning to feel the stress again after stoning for the last 2 hrs in front of the Word file without much progress on my Literature Review.  Opened another Explorer window. No new blog entries on any of my daily-read sites. Well of coz, who would publish a new entry every one hour?  Switched on the TV. Edward Scissorhand is on but I've watched it thrice. So dun bother.  Clicked on the MSN Messenger icon. Everyone is either in "away" or "busy" mode. Got nothing to talk to those available. Anyway not really in the chatting mode now coz i'm supposed to be concentrating on my Literature Review.  Argghhh... I want to break free~~~~~
