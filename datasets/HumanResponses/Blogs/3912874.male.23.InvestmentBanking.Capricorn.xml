      July 14, 2004  10:45pm Blogger... hmm... still interesting.  A creation of words: nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, etc, etc, etc... But of course with plethora of spelling and grammatical errors.    I'm only 23 years old and already I have dedicated my life to a career.  I'm already thinking about buying my first home, which the thought of getting myself entangled in the process of purchasing a home scares the bejesus out of me.  In my profession I do many things, among them are writing plans and financial advisory proposals.  It amazes me what deadlines can do to people.  Take me for example... I will push projects, or in this case writing plans and proposals, 'til the day before it's due... go into work at three or four in the morning to finalize everything.  There's a word that describes this... oh yes... sadistic.  Needless to say, I have a deadline tomorrow morning at 11.  But honestly, I don't feel so bad because the particular people I'm writing this for are not the ideal type of client.  Very unmotivated, suspicious and untrusting.  why, I'm not sure what the reason for working hard for these people is...  who the fuck knows  Among other things, depriving oneself of very valued sleep is an act accomplish by none other than a sadist.  It is almost 11 and I will be up back in my office in less than five hours.  There's a term that describes a description of oneself reflecting in a different perspective... introspective? anywho... I regularly criticize what I do and say as if those actions and locutions (?!?) came from another person.  So if I were to describe myself on any given day I would describe a struggling but ambitious young man who is insecure about his ability to succeed in the finance industry and corporate world who sometimes believes is suffering from insomnia.  hmm...   So back to this whole sleep deprivation topic.  My morning grogginess mistaken for hung-over ness,I am known in my office as the kid who likes to party and drink a lot.  Which neither is the case, except on certain weekends.  But that's a given.  anywho... tah tah for now

      July 12, 2004  11:03pm.  Blogger... interesting.  It's like an outlet for inconsequential petty self-expressions.  or is it?    I've always thought of internet personal diaries such as live journal and blogger as a useless waste of time.  Then... why am I online on blogger wasting away the little time life has to spare, when I can  and should  devote that time to sleep, work, or masturbation.  hmm.... who the fuck knows.  But for this being my very first internet journal entry I feel that I should post something creative, new, and enlightening.  hmm...  Awhile back I wrote an e-mail describing the makings of a good Martini.  Not that I am a lush or a fan of martinis or anything but... nonetheless far too many bartenders, party hosts, and wannabe entertainers screw up a great martini.  A martini is a drink to be raveled for it can quench the driest thirst or inebriate the shit out of you.  Martini's are never served unchilled: a definate travesty of cocktails.  They can be chilled by stiring, shaken, or plain frozen.  To each presumably have a slightly different taste and auspicion.  (fyi: auspicion is not an actual word) A traditional martini is composed of gin and a splash of vermouth, decorated with a few olives.  Flavored martini's are generally made with vodka, since vodka does not have as strong taste as gin does.    Anywho... all this talk about martini again is making me thirsty, but alas I should catch some zzz's to prepare for the next biggest thing since slice bread to happen at work.  whoppie doo...
