      My first trip to LA since my mom moved to Austin. (Technically, that's not true. I did a little 24-hour in-and-out trip for Shayne's wedding. But I stayed in the OC with Kirk and never bothered with LA on that trip.) The coincidence of Barbara's mom's visit with mine put me on Fleiner's futon, rather than in my dad's guestroom. The strangeness of sleeping on a couch in a city that I called home for 24 years is indescribable. Nor is it easy to describe the sort of shock that I felt when I peered out the little double-paned window of my very delayed Southwest flight to notice, for the first time, the bigness of LA. Familiarity tends to shrink and to make digestible that which was once overwhelming, and there seems to be an inverse correlation between my familiarity with and the digestibility of SF and the same of LA. As I grow more fond of and impressed by the former, I grow equally less fond of and less impressed by the latter.     (LA at night)   We ate at the Cheesecake Factory in Beverly Hills last night. Surprise, surprise.... For all the talk of LA's culture, Angelinos (at least those residing west of, say, La Cienega) sure love their corporate restaurant chains. It took only a few minutes of hearing Adam's gossip about his friends and his own recent (mis-)adventures to remind me of what a silly and screwed up place this is. Anyone who has ever met Adam (my best friend since the summer before Ms. Schliewe's 4th grade class at  urlLink El Rodeo ) will tell you that he is one of the sweetest, most generous people around. And to hear from this guy with a heart-of-gold ridiculous stories about the ridiculous women in this town, confirmed for me (between regular eye rolls) that this place is just a joke. A parody of itself. A Potemkin reality with no there there.      (when life seems a big movie)

      Now, I don't know much about this so-called " urlLink Sports Guy " columnist on espn.com, but he cracks me up—not because he's particularly funny (he's not), but because he's pretty damn random.  I only have one data point on which to base my sweeping conclusion, so take it for what it's worth, but it's just strange that this "guy"—who apparently knows a lot about "sports"—chooses to write about neither sports nor sports guys.  Instead,  urlLink he writes about Leno and Letterman and sketch comedy, and even spares a moment to dabble in the sociology of music :   We stayed at the Hard Rock, my favorite gambling spot because they have more hand-shuffled blackjack tables than any other casino. Unfortunately, the String Cheese Incident was playing there on Saturday night, so it looked like a giant hacky-sack game was about to break out for 48 straight hours. If there's a more loathsome guy on the planet than the broke stoner with Adam Duritz hair who wears a Phish T-shirt and somehow finds himself flanked by natural-looking beauties with armpit hair who aren't wearing bras, please let me know.    Ah, the culture wars between Cheese fans and faux sports writers return.  How heavy is a giant hacky-sack, anyway?  Probably too heavy to play with for 48 hours straight.  Well, no one ever accused sports columnists of eloquence (and apparently no one taught those columnists about dangling modifiers, either).         (two so-called loathsome guys)    And to preempt charges by those few people who (1) actually know the address of this blog and (2) sacrifice time that could be spent on countless more productive things (e.g.,  urlLink rock-balancing ): No, I am not bitter.  Nor am I loathsome.  At least not for the reasons so-called Sports Guy claims.  A well-paid fan of sobriety, I own no Phish shirts.  And the natural beauty who flanks me not only wears bras, but shaves to boot.  Don't get me wrong, though, I do sympathize with the position in which so-called Sports Guy found himself.  Voluntarily choosing to watch baseball at a b-rate sports book rather than basking in the sun while strippers play dodgeball is loathsome indeed.

            (from left: Johann, Jen, Juan, Aimée, Carrie, me, Kirk)      Don't let the all-too-expected title mislead...  Much of the weekend was far from expected.  Of all the times I've been to Vegas, this was the first trip on which I never left the hotel.  And why bother, when you can kick it by the best pool in Vegas all day, while Moseley kicks it a few lounge chairs next door, when the boys  urlLink Michael Jordan  " urlLink Johnny Cash ," when my photography saves Cuba Gooding Jr. from groupies (and when we totally blow our opportunity, in Vegas of all places, to ask him to show us the money), and when  urlLink Rehab  (check out the multiple albums in the bottom-right of the  urlLink linked page ) brings the freeks face-to-implant with the locals?       With one noteworthy exception (ignoring, our course, our tele-riding antics), the gang (above) showed up in full force, flair, and flamboyance.  And what a great way to wind-down summer tour!!!  After my first double-digit summer (and first four-show week), I'm taking a break until NYE.        (speaking of freaks)   This summer has been eye-opening in so many ways.  It was my first real attempt at balancing a very full plate at work with a very full travel schedule.  It was tougher than I thought, but infinitely more fulfilling than I could have imagined.  But for fear of sounding clichéd and cheesy I would wax nostalgic here until my fingers give-out.  Suffice it to say that I have cherished the time I spent with some really incredible people (both new and old) on the road this summer.  If I can plagiarize from one of those special people:          What I can remember, I won't soon forget!

       My previous post is hereby withdrawn.&nbsp; It exists below only as a tribute to this venture, as I feel like there is something very unpure about removing posts due to fleeting attitudes.&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink  Last night's show    disproved my proximity theory.&nbsp; If the   urlLink  first night at the Warfield    was&nbsp;a&nbsp;hard sell, it was not because of its locale.  &nbsp;  I will not bother with a play-by-play review of   urlLink  last night's show   .&nbsp; I will only say that last night was among the most memorable and fun I've had.&nbsp; I will not soon forget the feeling I left the Warfield with last night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;   (Mike and Keith agree)      urlLink  Vegas    looks promising!?!....

             After flying to Chicago, Portland, and Denver for 8 of my last 9   urlLink  incidents   , I grew really excited about the prospect of&nbsp;two   urlLink  incidents    at the Warfield, more or less in my backyard.&nbsp; Well, I've concluded that proximity is overrated.&nbsp; While it was nice to be able to walk over to   urlLink  last night's show    at&nbsp;the last minute, it also really altered my experience.&nbsp; When we’ve been on the road, it’s been really easy to get into show mode — that’s really been our only objective.&nbsp; When you wake up on the road,&nbsp;your only responsibility is getting ready for, and getting to, the shows.    L  ocal shows are a whole other story.&nbsp; Although I was able to get out of the office in the afternoon and to meet Kirk in the Haight, I wound up spending much of the afternoon&nbsp;on my cell phone dealing with work stuff.&nbsp; And it’s just hard to switch from work mode to play mode that quickly.&nbsp; The rushed Clark Kent change-a-roo combined with the Warfield's poor sound and SCI's slow openers (Search and Latinissmo) to&nbsp;create a really awkward first 20 minutes for me.&nbsp; But, once I got past that, I really had a great time.   Another show tonight.&nbsp; Rumor has it that Santana will guest.&nbsp; Joe's&nbsp;predicting Mr. Denson, instead.

       &nbsp;&nbsp;  Remember those SuperCuts commercials comparing SuperCuts' fabulous cuts to "OtherCuts"?&nbsp; Well, I have news for you: SuperCuts  is  OtherCuts.&nbsp; There is  no  difference.&nbsp;   I've needed a haircut for a while (it had been like 8 weeks since my last), but I just haven't had the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when things calmed down at work yesterday, I gave trusty ole' Gary a call to see if he&nbsp;had anything in the afternoon.&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; The only thing he had&nbsp;for me&nbsp;was a 10 am&nbsp;on Wednesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried explaining to&nbsp;Gary that I work and just can't make a mid-morning appointment.&nbsp; My pleas went unaswered.&nbsp; (Hey, he works on Polk St...he's not used to the emloyed.)&nbsp; So, I swallowed my pride and headed to&nbsp;the SuperCuts conveniently located on my walk home.&nbsp;&nbsp;"You need a haircut,&nbsp;honey," my old secretary announced as I passed her.&nbsp; The stars were aligned.  &nbsp;  Well, the stars fell out of alignment quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Things were looking&nbsp;good at first: a&nbsp;decent trim in back, not too much off the&nbsp;top or&nbsp;sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the clippers.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm just going to trim around your ears a bit," she explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't realize that was SuperCuts code for "I'm going to&nbsp;give you a Brian Austin Green stepped-side haircut."&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure if it's&nbsp;better or worse that she only stepped one-side.  &nbsp;  Note to self:&nbsp;Your&nbsp;left profile is the better one, now.

        Well, these posts take longer than I thought.&nbsp; More accurately, this  process  takes longer than I thought.&nbsp; Although I wonder how much of my "wasted" time is intrinsic to the process and how much is due to&nbsp;the partnership between&nbsp;my perfectionism and my meager understanding of HTML.  &nbsp;  I had originally conceived of this space as a place for stream-of-consciousness rants.&nbsp; But my stream-of-consciousness doesn't always spell and conjugate correctly — and, well, er, I have a thing for proper grammar.&nbsp; (Indeed, I'd call myself a grammarian but for (1) the stigma attached thereto and (2) my inevitable editorial guffaws and oversights.)&nbsp; So, the posts take time.&nbsp; Not gobs...but more than you'd think.&nbsp; And this all becomes even more complicated when you toss in&nbsp;the following open questions&nbsp;—    who composes my audience?  can and should I&nbsp;can control the composition of&nbsp;my audience (assuming I can answer the&nbsp;above question)?  who should I allow this online doppelganger to be (an issue&nbsp;closely tied to the audience questions)?  It's actually sort of strange to realize how easily one can manipulate and micromanage an online personality.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this space, I&nbsp;can control who I am to you by deciding which thoughts to share and which (mis-)adventures to describe (through which photos and with what tone).&nbsp; What will clutter my cutting-room floor will depend largely on who could potentially read this.&nbsp; Should this be for just me?&nbsp; For me and my friends?&nbsp; For my family, too?&nbsp; What about&nbsp;work people?&nbsp; Will people come here to learn about me?&nbsp; Will they stuble upon it?&nbsp; Will a background check uncover this?  &nbsp;  And, if considerations of audience will&nbsp;color who I am here, then how genuine a space is this really?&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, this isn't the space for pure honesty or for transcribed inner monologue.&nbsp; Instead, this is just some weird bin for my mainstream thoughts, my non-controversial opinions, and my g-rated strories.  &nbsp;  An edited and diluted journal is no journal at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps this whole effort is just&nbsp;drab kitch.

        I feel dirty.&nbsp; My first day in this new space and already I've become one of "them."&nbsp; It took me all of 6 hours to quote German philosophy.    I'm ashamed, really.&nbsp; But it had to be done.&nbsp; The breakdowns occurred, the wheels turned, and prudence lost.

       Weird night.&nbsp; Frustrated about my computer (and then Replay) crashing.&nbsp; I've gotten the Replay back up-and-running (I think), but the computer is dead.&nbsp; It's official.&nbsp; I called it at 5.     &nbsp;   The day reminded me of what Heidegger said about breakdowns.&nbsp; Heidegger explained that, through repetitive use, "equipment" (i.e., "tools") "withdraw."&nbsp; That is, the equipment as such recedes from the fore of our thoughts as we become "absorbed," as it were, in the "task" — the "towards which."&nbsp; Equipment "has a tendency to disappear."&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically (take note Allanis), we (re-)discover that equipment when it&nbsp;breaks and becomes "unusabl[e]."&nbsp;&nbsp;Breakdowns prove revelatory.     &nbsp;   I suppose all this babble can be distilled to the unremarkable proposition&nbsp;that we take things for granted when they work.&nbsp; We just assume the car will start when we turn the key; we don't really think about it until the car doesn't start.&nbsp; We forget we're driving until we grind a gear that&nbsp;screams, "Hey, idiot: You're driving a stick.&nbsp; Pay attention."     &nbsp;   Well, for 5 years, I turned on my computer everyday.&nbsp; And, save the occasional software or configuration bug, it just worked.&nbsp; I e-mailed, I word processed, I downloaded, I burned.&nbsp; And, in doing so, my computer ceased being a computer and became, in that teleology, the thing with which I e-mailed, word processed, downloaded, and burned.&nbsp; Now, it's a computer again—and a broken one at that.&nbsp; If this is transparency, I prefer the opaque.     &nbsp;          R.I.P. desktop box,    my old and trusty friend.    In the midst of the frustration, we (Aimée, Joe, Des, and I) decided to see the new  urlLink MetallicA documentary .&nbsp; It brought me back to freshman year in high school.&nbsp; Here's my ticket to my first  urlLink MetallicA  show.&nbsp; Damn, I used to love them.&nbsp; Really enjoyable and interesting film, by the way.&nbsp; &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;

          After 21 years,  urlLink Phish called it quits yesterday . And I—not the biggest Phish fan by any stretch—saw the whole thing. No, I didn't trek to Coventry, Vermont to deal with insane lines and rain and mud. Nor was I one of the thousands who parked on the side of the road, finding an 12-mile walk a less bad option than waiting in line. Nope. I just drove to Sacramento (Bay Area theaters sold out almost a week ago) and watched the whole thing unfold via satellite on the silver screen.  So, how did it all end? Gracefully. No trampolines or meatsticks. No back-to-the-camera shenanigans. After three sets—nay, 21 years—they ended right where they started, with "The Curtain With." After Trey explained Curtain's background—written in a Thoreau-ish '83 summer with only Marley by his side—the band began it in the wrong key, as Trey, with the evening's last words, explained half-way through. They dropped a half-step to E flat, played the reprise and, one-by-one, stopped playing until the only sound left was a short loop through Trey's delay pedals. Trey bent over to switch off the pedal—and as it were, 21 years of music. He remained bent for a long bow, hugged a stoic Mike, and tearfully walked off stage.  Heisenberg taught that observation alters. I wonder if last night disproved that, however. The sold-out theater was decorated with all things concert: the dreaded hair, the funk, the glow stick wars, the nalgenes, the hippie skirts, the heady dudes, the beach balls, the drugs, the dancing in the aisles and by the screen. Everything but the band. Still the audience clapped and cheered, hooted and hollered, and even offered a standing ovation at the end. Knowing that the band can't see or hear you makes you think about whether you clap for you, or for them, or for the people around you. You don't clap at the end of a song when you watch a DVD on your couch. You don't encourage Trey during a DVD jam. You just watch. But there is something about a "simulcast," about watching  contemporaneously  and with a thousand others, about habit. And so you clap.  In truth, the quartet knew all to well that they were being watched. They played not only to the tens of thousands at the festival and the thousands of others in the theaters. They played to the larger audience of history. Posterity watched and posterity altered.  Personal highlights: Weekapuag, a Velvet Sea a choked up Page had to re-start three times, Trey's speech after ("we thought we'd break all the rules; and here we are 18, no 21, years later, and we're the ones who have learned so much"; "having these three guys next to you through the ups and downs we all go through..."; etc.); and the "blow off some steam" jam that followed, complete with the set-ending cathartic Trey feedback solo.  With that, this phaux phan will leave the rest of the pontiphicating to the phamily of phisheads much more phamiliar with the Phish phenomenon.   Set 1 : Mike's Song > I am Hydrogen > Weekapaug Groove, Anything But Me, Reba, Carini > Chalkdust Torture > Possum, Wolfman's Brother* > jam (with Mike's and Trey's Mom jam dancing) > Wolfman's Brother > Taste  Set 2 : Down With Disease> Wading in the Velvet Sea, tearful Trey speech, Glide, Split Open and Melt > jam > Ghost  Set 3 : Fast Enough for You, Seven Below > Simple > Piper > tribute to Bruno and Dickie Scotland > Wilson > Slave to the Traffic Light  Encore : Trey speech, The Curtain With

      When I took delivery of my new computer a few days ago, I began to transfer all the files I had backed-up on CD. In the process, I stumbled across a bunch of old papers I had written at Cal. I had a great time scrolling through them and reminiscing about the old days of school, when my sole purpose in life was to think. Thus inspired, I found the e-mail address of a rhetoric professor who had acted as a mentor of sorts for me. Officially, he advised on  urlLink my honors thesis ; unofficially, he encouraged me to keep writing, to work in the San Quentin education program (one of the most rewarding experiences in my life), and, generally, to stay interested, informed, and involved in whatever it is that drove me. I credit him with the tremendous respect and admiration that I feel for Cal.  Long story short(er): I e-mailed him, updated him on my life—graduating law school, new job, new band to follow (last he knew, it was Biscuits and DMB)—and got back the following response:   I love the String Cheese Incident (they play Champaign a few times a year, to packed houses) and will smile all day thinking of you jamming to them in the Oregon woods! (After discovering my client's and now my professor's palate for fromage, I'm beginning to wonder whether Mr. Fleishman's favorite refrain about Deadheads ("we're everywhere") is not slowly beginning to ring true of Cheeseheads. But I digress.) He continued:    As for working for The Man, well, at some level we all do, right? . . . The real question is this: are you intellectually alive, existentially true, and interpersonally satisfied with your work?  Heady questions. I wrote back:    I've thought about this often, and I guess the answer depends what time of day I ask. There are some very challenging aspects to my job, things that just blow my mind. There's also plenty of mundane...they don't teach you that in law school. Sometimes I feel like litigation is nothing but the dolled-up disputes of sandboxes, among adult children whose arrogance and pride preclude thoughtfulness and pragmatism.  That said, I'm in the middle of a very interesting prisoner appeal. We have argued to the Ninth Circuit that this three-strikes marijuana felon deserves restored his good-time credit (which he lost when he had the audacity to challenge, though the prison grievance system, a write-up he received from a guard). It's a First Amendment case, the wet dream of every green law student.  And here's where it gets interesting (in case you were wondering if/when). He wrote back:    Considering what a great writer you are [ahhh....], have you thought about trying to write an essay (or essays) about the case you are working on? It sounds fascinating and full of importance.   Of course I have. I thought about writing about all sorts of things I'm doing. Most obviously, I'd love to write about my experiences this summer. Second to that, I would love to write about this whole law-school-to-lawyer transition, my cases (particularly the pro bono one), etc. But I just feel that everything I have two say will fall into either of two not-so-glamorous categories: (1) to the insider familiar with these subjects, my observations will appear totally trite, eliciting the 4th grade response of " urlLink duh!?! " or (2) to the outsider unfamiliar with these subjects, my observations will cause eye-rolling, the arrogant and critical snap judgments in which I (when myself something of an outsider) so often engaged. It's sort of like the quasi-memoirs I've written of certain events in my life. Why anyone will find my adventures (and thoughts thereon) interesting is a question with which I struggle. Still, I write—privately at least.  Well, if you've read this far, I guess I should share something.  urlLink Here's the poem  I read to the concert gang at Sanchos Broken Arrow in Denver, just before the Red Rocks run. I was sort of embarrassed to show it to any outsiders until I got back from my professor the following words of encouragement (which I take as an extraordinary compliment, given the source's own wonderful poetry and high standards): "I love the poem--fun and playful and joyous." Enjoy, mock, or do whatever else it is you do.       (Kirk enjoyed it, at least)
