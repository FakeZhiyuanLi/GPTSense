       Just a little while ago, I had the Blue and White meet for swim team. It was fun, except the fact that I kept getting my ass kicked in the events. That because its my first year in the age group. Oh well, lining up was fun. I was talking with everyone, Scott, Ally, Erica, Annie, Kevin, and this kid from Hopkinton or Holliston? I don't remember, but, hes on the team and yea. Well, I changed the name of this blog. I don't know why but, I think the other name was just stupid, but the URL (thats the address) is the same(frenchisbad.blogspot.com). Two foot Prymaid, I know its really weird, but I couldn't think of anything and I was looking at the prymaid that I drew on the back of my social studies notebook. It took me a while, but its really cool, I drew every little block into it, maybe someday you might see it. I named it the Prymaid of Phin. But its cool, it takes up most of the page. Wow, I'm really random right now. Eliza told me a line from her play. Its like "One time I ran over a squirel and kept driving!" I guess shes one of the siners in the play, Anything Goes. Well, I'm going to go see it when they are putting it on.

       So I met the kids on my team, well, six of them at least. They were all younger then me, but there are 3 kids my age. I felt like a guinea pig, they were almost testing me and asking me everything about it. It was strange, but I was kind of glad when it was over. I was getting in a fight with my mouth about the team. I kept saying stuff and she didn't say anything till we got home. I really want to go to Agawam this year for Labor Day. Otherwise, we have to go to North Andover which would be a hotel one. Well, I hope this coming year goes well.

       Its only an hour and 45 minutes till I find out whos on my soccer team. So far, I know of 4 or 5 people on it and theres still another 12 that I have to meet. Well, I hope it goes well. Kayla is the funniest person at my basketball camp. At lunch the other day, she was all "What now bitch, what now?". Everyone was cracking up from it. And then, she thought she could whip my ass in bball, but, we tied, somehow. But, she is soo funny. My team was yelling at her to get the hell off our side and she was all like "Fuck you, fuck you!". Kayla, your awsume!!

       At my camp, there are two gyms, the older kids gym and the younger kids gym. Yesterday, I had to change into the little kids gym because my 2v2 partner and I was doing really bad. So today, I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to switch back to the other gym, but then I was able to!! I was really happy cuz the little kids one is just too little. So, they put me on blue with Brian W and a couple people were asking why I was on it, but oh well, I'm on it.

       Today was my first day of camp and it sucked. I had to hang out with mostly kids going into 7th cuz I'm not really friends with the kids my age there. So, I got pared off with Tina and I thought it would be ok, but we did horrible in 2v2. We got 1 win in total and 13 loses just the first time. So, then we got in our teams. I was on light blue with some other kids I knew. Then we had lunch which wasn't bad, expect I had two things to eat. Then when we were doing 2v2 again, Tina told me that we should switch into the other gym. So we did and now it stinks, so tomorrow I'm going to switch back. Now, I have swim team. I'm so excited, lol.

       I just have to say it. I was mad about what soccer team I was on, but, now I am happy about it. You want to know you? Well, because the number 1 team is going to  SUCK  this year because they have the  SUCKIEST  players ever on the face of this year. But, as for the number 2 team, they are going to  ROCK ! Hehe just playing number 1 guys, but, number 2 is still going to do better :)

       Well, I haven't posted in almost a week. Thats because I've been at the beach(cape cod)almost going crazy. I was so bored, there was just me, my mom, my grandmother, and my sister is a 1 floor, 5 room house. And we just had one tv but the bad part was that my grandmother, who owns the place, got senoirs package for the cable. There was nothing to watch! Tomorrow, I start my first camp, a basketball one. I don't really know whos going to it but I know a couple people are. And, tomorrow, Mia is leaving for Domicia! I wanna go with her. Oh, and my cousin is taking a vacation in a vacation. Shes in England for two weeks and for 3 days she in Ireland! AH, I wanna go there! Shes so damn lucky!!!!!  On Tuesday night, at 7:30 at Gerards farm, my new soccer team will have a "meeting" to discuss a few things. I don't care about the other things, I only care about whos on it! I know a couple already, but, I wanna find out about the rest. Lol

       Finally, school ended yesterday. We were really suppost to get out on Friday but because of a "snow" day, we had to stay one extra day. OK, it wasn't horrible, we got to go to the lake and swim for an hour after the acticites the "Jack" planned.  After school, I went to Mad Willies with LOD, and I saw a bunch of people I knew......from Fuller. I didn't bring any money so I was just hitting up LOD for money. Now, I kind of feel bad, but not really. This morning my mom called and she goes "Last night I got a call about what soccer team your on." I was practiclly crossing my fingers because I wanted to make 1 so badly. Then she goes..."Your on Mr. Parishs team" I was about to scream! Thats the 2 team. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, now I have to be with little 7th graders. UG. So, then she says "He's trying to plan a little get together for you guys to meet each other. And I found out a couple people on the team. Theres Fabio, Larry, and of course Jeff." JEFF? Who cares, hes in 7th. My mom thought it was going to be good because last year they had "special" uniform for the regular season. HELLO! YOU CAN'T WEAR THOSE! Oh well, maybe, if I'm lucky, Nestor made the team and I won't be alone. Phin

       I'm really bored right now. My mom and sister went down to the cape for the weekend, so now I'm stuck at home with my dad. I have swim team is a little while and I still haven't had diner yet. I'm hoping that its Hometowne Hotdogs, that place is awsume. I have nothing to do and nothing really to say today, its just really boring.    My life is rated PG-13.  What is your life rated?   I'm taking quizes again, I guess. Theres really nothing else to do right now. No one is on, of course. I barely see anyone that doesn't go to camp or anything like that. Of course, I'm taking them on Quizilla, except for that one, I don't know where that one comes from.

        So I'm watching the Olympics, its just the opening ceremonies though. It seems like they have shown the whole world yet but their not even half way through. There on Canada because of the Greek Alphabet. The US had the most plain outfits of the whole ones. Its pathitic.   So anyways...   Amanda gave me a link to see the    1985 music video, so its in my pro! I love that song. I think Ally got me hocked on it. Now they are on the Cayman Islands, how boring. I've never even heard of them. I'm gonna go talk to people now and I still haven't seen the people that I met that are going to the Olypmics. One was from the US, but theres so many, I couldn't even find him. The other is from the Virgin Island. WHAT THE FUCK! Yao Ming is a Chinesse resident? Oh, ew, I just smushed a bug on my screne, yuck!    Good luck Amanda at regionals, hope you win a  GOLD  !

        Ok, so today, or more like tonight,  is the opening cermenary for the Olympics in Greece! I'm so excited! I love the olympics! I'm getting a pizza tonight because of it and I'm going to watch every moment of it!      So, my mom finally decided that she would let me go to sleep away camp for next year. My grandmother convinced her. So I went and got the stuff from Maggie and her mom and we talked for a while. So, then she told all about it and last night my mom sent in the form. Oh, yea, its the one Maggie and her cousins go to. So, now I'm hoping I make it in, which I probably will because I sent it in really early, but they won't open it till October 14 or something. But I hope I get in to Coniston!

        So while I was at camp yesterday(monday) one of my brackets from my braces broke off. It didn't even hurt. It felt like nothing had happened.    Then after camp, my mom and I went to get my dad and sister so that we could go tryout the kayaks that we might buy. So we got there, did the "paperwork" and then were able to get on the types that we wanted. So, we went out to this island and circled around it and then came back and switched boats. I was having so much trouble with the other one I knew that it wasn't going to be mine. So, after that, we bought them. One for me, one for my parents.

        So this morning I had B regionals. Its not the really good one, but I always do good at it. So, first I had butterfly. I was ranked last out of 3 because there was only 3 swimming. But I didn't really good and came in first so I get a   gold    metal for that! Then I had freestyle, which I also won, so thats    gold    metal number 2. Then I had relay which was 15-18. We were the only ones to as long as we don't DQ in any way, we would get first place. So, in total, I got 3    gold    metals! Yea!!!!    So now I'm waiting until my dad gets home and then we are going to the Revolution game in Foxoboro. I have seats 6 rows up from the field so their really good. Ally, Erica, and Laura are also going to it so I might see them, but I don't know because they are up in a box.

        So today was the last day for the first week of camp. So, most of the day, we ran through the parts that we had learned. We also learned the Egg, Nest, and Tree song. Thats a fun one. We get to make a human boat-shaped thing. So I'm the sail in it since I'm one of the tallest. Then at the end of the day, we all got in this big circle and we had to do a small writing thing. First, he told us some of the scenes that got cut. And I couldn't believe that my scene, The Butter Battle, got   cut   ! I couldn't believe it. Its such a good scene! But then someone said what are we going to have for scernery and the director said that he was going to may me help with some backdorps. I couldn't believe it! He thinks I can    paint   ? It might be cuz of the backdrops that I painted in the display case when you enter    PAC    from the elavator. Well, I hope they will be good ones, cuz if not,  its    my    head     on the chopping board.    Lol   !

         Ugh, I have  my play song stuck in my head. Its called "Oh the thinks you can think" from Seussical.  Its the first song we learned from it so I'm always singing it! I should be singing my part, "The Military", thats right, The Military. I'm Gerneral Gengus Cong Schmitz, I scare childern out of their wits (oops, those were some of my lines! Hehe, I've almost memerized them and its only the first week!).  I'm getting kind of made at camp (which is the play) because we keep practicing the same parts and we never tired my part until today. The director got really made at Caitlin today and made her cry! I felt really sorry for her because she didn't know what she was suppost to do and he was showing of the shit that he was telling her down her throught. Hes getting to be a real annoying bitch. Only Brandi and Josh are the nice ones. Dan (the     EVIL    director) never does any scene except Wickershim and The Whos.     Ok, so, I'm going to B regionals. There Saturday and I'm not really scared at all. Normally I'm freaking out now because there so close, but, nope, not this time. I can't wait till them and when I get on the block and swim butterfly! I'm so excited. How pathitic? Well, I've got practice and normally, I would be leaving really soon but nope because of my sister and her injury.

           Wow today got  wacked in the afternoon. So, about 10 minutes before the movie was about to start, Stephanie called and said she could come. So, my dad drives me over. He was gonna see a movie also, but he got there late and it was packed so he didn't go. So I was waiting out there for maybe 20 minutes, the movie we were going to see had started, so I thought she was running a little late. So, about 5 minutes later, I call her and she says that she can't come. I'm thinking, Oh great, I'm stuck at the movies alone. So, I kept calling my house and after a while when there wasn't an answer, I decided to walk home. So, I'm leaving the parking lot and theres this car following me, then when I'm almost at the exit, the guy in it goes "Are you parked anywhere near here?" So I go "I don't drive" and he goes "Oh, well I wish you did" and then drives away lookng for a spot. I was like, ok. So, I'm walking and walking and walking, and when I was about at Target, I finally got ahold of my dad, so I tell him about what happened and said hurry home so we can get some supper. So I made it home a little while later. So, then we went to Kellys Roast Beef (not Rileys) and I had  supper. Then I had this soccer kick around with my team and another team. Then I came home and here I am!

        So lots of camps have ended so far this summer for me. This one that I have been going to for years ended and I can't go to it anymore because I'm to old to. So, anyway, this weekend, I'm home doing nothing! I think I'm going to the movies today with Stephanie, but I'm not sure.  So, yesterday, I was so bored. I was online all day and reading my summer reading book which I finished in 1 day. I hated it, it was horrible! So, now, I'm just hanging out, waiting for Stephanie to get home so I can call her about the movies. We're eather going to see The Village (that looks awsume!) or Anchorman, which i don't really want to see, but I will go to it if I have to.      Anyway, I'm so bored. I wish I was here--->(Canobie Lake Park, the picture wouldn't work :() with Mia instead of home!
