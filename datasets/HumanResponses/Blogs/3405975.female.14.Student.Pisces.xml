      Things I have just realised --------------------------  -- It's a bit akward writing feelings inside your blog.  -- I'm bossy -- I hate projects -- The sentence "Being alone, you will not get hurt by others nor will you hurt others" is quite true. -- I need a lot of money 'cause I want to buy comics, clothers, shoes...etc. -- Hidayat is gonna be missed by everyone as he is an important person in our class. -- If the stupid manager of the farm doesn't call soon, I'm going to... -- People nowadays have such a good life, and once danger lurks, painc is easily in the air.    Some kind of stupid realisations huh.

      Hmm... Am I really that bossy? Heck, I think I'm going to be like Ming. >.  Ast   P.S -- Sorry, Hui Shin. I know that you can think for yourself and I don't know what happened to me the other time (maybe I'm, jus being bossy and out of line) and I said something so commanding and domineering (sp?). Sorry.

      Oh yea, yesterday was school carnival day. Heck, so tired at the end of the day that maybe my hormones went haywire...'cause I cried! OH MY GOD, I did not even know why I was such in a depressed mood... Felt like crying but cannot cry, and in less then 3 minutes later, tears came to my eyes... >. don't like  crying infront of other people, including my good friends! I think that it feels weird. Hey, maybe I'm a loner 'cause I prefer to cry by myself! Haha... Well, enough about depressed moods and crying, let's turn back time and go back to the morning, at 7am! Woke up at 6am...on a Sunday morning!!! Helloooooo...Rarely do people do that?! Guess I'm special. =P Anyway, upon reaching school, realised that there was only Fion, Jasmine and me. *Looks out and thinks ' Why did all the people go?? '* Anyway, most of the other people arrived at 7:30am and 8am plus... Helped out with last minute preparation and   voila  !   It was time for the carnival to start!  Ding ding ! Wow, there was sooo many people and quite a lot came to our "Dart 'em all" stall! Basically, just throwing darts at balloons. Hmmm... Honestly, I like the haunted house the best. It's so kool and scary!!! And the doorman did not help make things better by saying that the band room(the place where the haunted house is) is haunted!!!!!!!! I was standing in front of my group somemore... We went in in groups of threes. Fion, Hui Shin and Liying. MIng, Karen and me. Yiting, YingLi and Jas. You know what, odd numbers are unlucky numbers! =P Saw lots of "ghosts"! SOme hands touched my legs too! Maybe I should sue them for molest! Haha... Then there was this scene where a girl sat infront of a mirror and old chinese music was playing in the background!! *shivers* Heck, I'm gonna suffer from a heart attack!!! And Ming's hand was holding mine so tightly!! But, it's all right 'cause she's mi wifey! There was this spot where someone jumped infront of us! That was when we all screamed together! *pants pants* Kool! I want to go again! ^^ Anyway, went on to shoot small basketballs into the hoop/basket thingie. Got 3 tries, but only one got in and it was by luck too!! -.- I really,   really   wanted the red soft toy that was like a gigantic, oversized mouse. I think it was a cartoon character. And right now, I'm recalling the scene where I saw a girl hugging a lot of soft toys (or maybe there was a few big ones, making it seem a lot). A guy, I bet is her boyfriend, placed his hands on her waist!!! Awww...so sweet. I bet he won those soft toys for her, 'cause he's sweating and everything. *Envy* I want a boyfriend too!!!! Hahaha...I'm hopeless. I scare guys away, man! *Victory sign* ^^ Anyway, I caught some fishies in long kang fishing!!! Erm...Not me who caught it... I failed to catch any within the 35s time limit. The people in charge caught 4 for me! So good!!! Haha, and the fishies (plus 5 more which I bought in the market today) are swimming in the fish tank in my living room! So cuteZ! Anyway, left school at 5:15 for West Mall. That was when they were playing Qing Tian... And maybe, it was because of Chicky that I cried... Hah! Impossible! *denys, denys and  keep denying!* Anyway, Liying bought one very nice red wasit pouch!! Converse!! It was so cheap! $9.90 only! Lucky, yesterday was the last day of the sale... Liying predicted it correctly! *ding ding* Anyway, that was basically yesterday's events. Hmm...  Ast  -If love can be counted into stars, I bet the universe is not big enough to contain my love for you. -

      Woo hoo~! Tomorrow's the day! ^^ The carnival's tomorrow! Just hope that nothing can go wrong with my class's stall. >. does  fly... And throughout this whole duration, stupid Akm disappeared! Heck, I only saw him when we went to get some pizza, me and Minglyanna! Hehe... Hui Shin and Fion were up in the netball court still decorating... Sorry! , gurls! But at lest there  was  a slice of pizza for them upstairs... >. can't  stand it~!!! Anyway, today's quite fun overall, we left Jordan by himself in the stall... Hehe, sorry man!  Ast

      It feels familiar... This whole thing about creating a blog! Heck, 'cause this is my second time having a blog. Hmmm, though Xanga is much, much, much, much more easier then blogger. >. again  is because Hui Shin askes me questions about blogs since she has one now... Somehow, in one way or anothe, I wanted to have a blog again... A different blog from the one I had in Xanga. Anyway, that's it for first post I guess...       Ast

       Why is the sky dark? I'm blinded by these shit I'm numb, coldness seeping in No more feelings breaking in I'm endorsed with ice The hurt won't raise I wanna shout When the lights out When no one's there And no feelings break in I promise; I swear The numbness shocking me Pull me out from this deep pit I don't wanna die alone here, please Fear's coming and gone again The hurt's all left inside of me Why is the sky dark? I'm blinded by these shit I'm numb, coldness seeping in No more feelings breaking in Halt my mind, make it stop I don't wanna hear these stupid thoughts The voice is bugging me non-stop Just shut it up, I'm begging, please I'm on my knees, I'm slumping down Into the deep pit I've dug myself I'm blinded by these shit No more feelings breaking in What's left is gone What's gone has left No more...no more feelings breaking in...

      Yesterday went to Orchard... Bought a berretcap and a ring (specially for my middle finger =D)! ^^ Couldn't find any knee-length socks that catch my eye... Awww... >.  Anyway, had to wake up early today for Flag Day... Oh man, feel so tired after yesterday's shopping trip summore... -.- Hiaz, woke up a bit too early... Anyway, today's the longest flag day ever! 5 hours!!! 10-3. Hmph, I was late for half an hour~ ^^ Heh, today's the only day where I finish all my stickers! They only gave 2 pieces of paper (the stickers). Maybe that's why the stickers can be finished easily. Hiaz, one woman scolded me, saying "Can you stop bugging people anot?"  in a very irritated voice~ I know that that was the second time I asked her; once when she went into Woodlands Civics Centre and another when she came out~  She nv even donated money the first time round. Geesh...Heck, I was, like, waiting there for her to come out the third time so I could  purposely  ask her to donate money so that I could scold her! Haha, but I didn't see her again... Awww...  Gonna grow very fat le! Ate chicken chop! >.  Ast  - Just harden your heart so you could not be hurt by others. -

      My heart is swimming in words  formed by the wind.  My voice carried  by a cloudy tommorrow.   A mirror moved  by the moon, trembled my heart.  Soft tears  filled with a stream of stars.   Isn't it beautiful?  Two of us walking hand in hand.  I want to go to  your town, your home, your arms.   I dream of lying  against your chest.  My body in your clasp,  disappearring into the evening.   Words stopped by the wind  are a gentle illsion.  A cloud-torned tommorrow is  a far-away voice.   My heart has been in  a moon-blocked flowing mirror.  Stars that swayed and flowed  can't hide my tears.   Isn't it beautiful?  Two of us walking hand in hand.  I want to go to  your town, your home, your arms.   I dream of  your face  that softly melts  in the morning.

      Now, I'm gonna solemnly swear to the wall that I'm going to :  1) Study  2) Do my homework and hand it in on time 3) Er.... Save up money 4) Try to get good grades for End-of-Year examz  .... Well, at least I'm gonna try. Nowadays when I always last minute do homework, it made me realise that it's been so long since I've actually  COMPLETED  my homework at home. The first thing that I do when I get home is : *beep* on goes the computer. Hiaz....And my grades are getting from bad 2 worse~ >.  Mum's been telling me to revise my work, study...All those things. But, if I've actually revised and study at the first place, she won't have nagged at me rite? *answers own question: Rite~* Hehe...  Anyway, I wanna cut my hair!!!!!!!!! It's dropping so much~! Heck, even Fion tot&nbsp;I've gotten mi hair cut before I even told her it was dropping like there's no tomorrow...~  The horror~~~   &nbsp; Ast  - Όταν σας αγαπώ, θα μαδήσω τα αστέρια από τον ουρανό και θα τα σας δώσω σε.

      OKay, my heart's starting to pump up right NOW. Damn annoyed. Jus read yiting's blog. Hey, she's mention me. Well, for the "unlike a certain SOMEONE" comment, I prefer if people mention me using my name. Hey, I'm mentioned in that comment so at least I have to right to say that rite?! It's me u r talking about. What's more, if she wanted to watch the moive, den OF COURSE we have to have IPW everyday den till Saturday, cuz we are seriously gonna rush through. Yea, and as for the "den next week u dun go watch movie lorz", okay, it is commanding, but for god's sake  dey can SURELY watch it after ipw fin rite? It's not as though we have much time for our ipw that we can spare to watch a moive... WADEVA...I said I'm not gonna be mad...breathe in breathe out...  AsT  - No Quote -

      Ahh... Jus realised something... Though I dislike Ms Kokila, if I keep hating her, it will make me feel so sianz and irritation by what she did whenever I'm in her classes... And anyway, by changing the dislike to like, it might even make her classes seem interesting instead of boring. She never really did anything bad to me...(now then I realise) so there's really nothing about her that shud make dislike her... Maybe she's being too bossy or whatever,but everyone  DO  have some bad points about them. She's still a human afterall... And just like keep disliking her for no reason seems a bit childish 'cuz it's not as though she killed my faimly *touch wood* or harmed me in any way... Hmmmm... (looks at clockz) Time to bathe! With the rubber duck (quack quack!) =P  Ast  - When there's love, there's pain... So babe, can we just go through the pain first than the love? -

      I'm not gonna be mad, sad or anything that is depressing. I wanna learn such skills to prepare me for kendo!!!! KENDO!!!!! KENDO KENDO KENDO!!!!!!!!! Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... It'd be kooL to be able to fight using a wooden sword... Able to show off to others that you know fight skills...But that is not the principle of kendo. HIazz....  Anyway, I'M GONNA SAY IT RIGHT NOW. I'm not gonna be submissive... (Where did that come from?? *looks around* ) I hate people who are submissive, but I read in a book that "What you dislike in others, you will find them in yourselves too". -.- Is that true?? Haha, so if I hate submissive people I'm submissive too?! >.  Doing IPW now...SOmewhat, we are slacking... Haha, I'm a stupid, ignorant, lazy, good-for-nothing leader...And you guys just luv me! THANK YOU THANK YOU!! =D Anyway, that's it I guess...for now. GOnna see if I can update when I'm home...*charges forward* IPPPWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  -Ast-  - BEing able to fly is great. Being able to have freedom is better- Being able to have you by my side at night whenever I get cold and you are there to warm me is the best off all-
