      So something to ponder: I was reading an article from Japan. You know its super busy and any type of stopping slows everyone down. (like rush hour traffic).  So, they have this idea, if automatic doors are supposed to be to keep people moving, why is it you have to stop for them to open?? Is it because the store owners dont want them to be opened by passing people? In that case, it would be faster to have manual doors. I guess its to make people feel special like they are opening the doors for   ME.

      Well, maybe there is. Yesterday I took a nap during the day so I was unable to sleep last night. Also, for dinner David and I went to IHOP and over 4 cups of coffee each, we had good conversation. By the time we arrived home the clock was pushing 11:30pm. I had just finished reading book 4 of the series I am on and was searching for book 5 to upload to my PDA, but, was unsucessful. So, instead I browsed other blogs and templates and so fourth. I had decided that I might as well stay up all night since I was bouncing off the walls. Even my cat was wired. David and I were going to try and make the gym when they open at 4:30am. He was getting sleepy so we both attempted to sleep around 3:15am. I was dozing in and out but, when 4:15 rolled around it had felt like I had slept an eternity. I bet in total I got about 45 minutes of sleep. But, the stubborn person I am, forced myself to toss and turn until 5:30. So, I got up and left David to torture himself for another 40 minutes. :)  So, I fed the cat, took out the trash, made some white rice and let the dog run around since she is always hyper. So, here I am, never made it to the gym, but I was on a roll with my next painting gallery ideas.  Any one out there like me?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? I wonder if anyone ever reads this.  Maybe I have no life.. but I do. Hmm, well, another day not looking forward going to work. Hafta leave in an hour, and I'm wishing I was somewhere else like downtown taking random pictures of people opening shop in the garment district. Until next time.

      This is my first posting, and a glimpse into my life and my thoughts. My first random thoughts go like this: My cat is not fat, he's big or fluffy.   I am on book 4 out of a series of 10.. Janet Evanovich's bounty hunter adventures of Stephanie Plum, her sidekick friends Lula the ex-prostitue, Sally the straight drag queen, and the notorious womanizer Joe Morelli.  I will be going on a vacation some time to a place where nobody knows my name.  Mutts.  I love pan dulce. mmmm. I hate Papaya, love mangos, hate liver and would kill for unos tacos de pescado con repollo, chile, crema, salsa de aguacate. Or, Birria de res.  What has my husband got me into this time? Always causing trouble.  Until next time!  Amanda

      For all of you who think life is a fucking box of chocolates....   I was on my way to pick up David from his&nbsp;Spartacist Leauge's&nbsp;office. I had stopped at Valerios for dinner, but had nothing to drink. So I pull in across the street at Chano's at the corner of Beverly and Vermont. I notice some people about my age (23 or so) yelling and chasing each other. I thought nothing of it. I get out of my car and put my dollar in a machine to get a Coke but was all sold out. Then, *BAM* I hear a car crash like sound. I turn around and then *BAM* again. The guys that were being chased by this lady say "OH FUCK!!" as they took off like lightening. The girl starts screaming in excrutiating pain. The guys had hit her with a baseball bat. I saw the guys run off and I asked her if she was okay. Obviously not. So I went inside and asked the people at the counter if they saw the guys hit that lady and they were all lookin around, and on their security cameras and they start freakin out a little. Another man came in after me, ordered his drinks and then advised that perhaps the cops should be called because some shit was going down. I got my drink and went back outside. I was like fuck this, I'm gonna get the fuck outta here. I don't wanna be a witness to shit!&nbsp; So, I'm walking back to my car and the lady was yelling over her screams to the girl that was with her "You better tell your home boys I'm gonna fuckin kill 'em!!"&nbsp; I was like hell yeah, I'm outta here. So I get behind my wheel, and the lady starts stripping her sweatshirt off and kneels on the ground. I look over and there is a guy bleeding and unconscious on the ground at the back of the restaurant. The guys had beaten him with their bat. So, here comes David and I was motioning to him "Hurry the fuck up!" I quickly explain the situation and fucking took off. Then the sirens were approaching and I hurried and busted a right onto the 101 freeway.   Just another day in the life of a  Latino . Just trying to get by in life the best you can.   So, what does this teach all you privliged fuckers out there???   1)Never be a snitch.  2)Don't complain that your life is fucking hard when its not.  3)Chano's has the best 'papasote' burritos.

      i hope they are able to rent that house in San Diego.. I just want to finish school already...but I can't decide what to do. I'm afraid to do what I love for the fear of failure. I think I should do something that pays better just so I never have to worry about money again. I hate it.
