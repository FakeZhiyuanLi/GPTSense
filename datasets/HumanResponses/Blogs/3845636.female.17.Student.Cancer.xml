       hee~ *ahem* WeLcOme to Fz's fIrst Blog...  Hmn... *Beaute De Rose*... I shall introduce this song...    **The Rose**  Some say love, it is a river  that drowns the tender reed.  Some say love, it is a razor  that leaves your soul to bleed.  Some say love, it is a hunger.  an endless aching need.  I say love, it is a flower,  and you its only a seed.   It's the heart afraid of breaking  that never learns to dance.  It's the dream afraid of waking  that never takes the chance.  It's the one who won't be taken,  who cannot seem to give,  and the soul afraid of dyin'  that never learns to live.   When the night has been too lonely  and the road has been too long,  and you think that love is only  for the lucky and the strong,  just remember in the winter  far beneath the bitter snows  lies the seed that with the sun's love  in the spring becomes the rose.   ______..___8"=,,88,_.__________________   _______8""=""8'__"88a88'_______________   __.._.;88m_a8___,8""_"8________________   ___"8"'__"88"__A"_____8;_______________   _____"8,__"8___8_______"8,_____________   ______"8___8,__8,_______"8_____________   _______8,__"8,_"8,_______8,____________   _______"8,__"8,_"8mm""""""8m.__________   ________"8,am888i"'___I3,mm"___________   ________,8"___8"__I3.m888"_____________   _______,88P"""""I3I888888______________   _______"'_________"I888________________   ____________________"I8________________   _____________________"I8_______________   ______________________"I8_____________-    Meaningful lyrics... a lovely song~   Basically... I think I'm quite an approachable person but it takes time to understand me better. Hmn... quite emotional and sentimental too. I love the people around me. I'm a perfectionist, so I guess I have lots of expectations. At times I may feel a little lost and confused, but thanks to those who have been guiding me on the way.  A hopeless romantic here too... hmn, enjoy star gazing on a starry starry night, loves the beach, loves roses, loves beautiful music, loves purple, pink, rainbow... , loves every single bit of the natural beauty on this Earth...  Thank God and the dear ones around me for what I am today.   " Friends like you don't grow on tress. I know that this is true, but if friends were flowers, there is no doubt how qickly I'd pick you"   "Friends are angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have trouble remembering how to fly. There is no beginning or end. Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is mystery. Today is a gift. Dream what you want to dream, Go where you want to go, Be what you want to be. Because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do..."    A sad thing in life is when you meet someone who means a lot to you, only to find out in the end that it was never meant to be and you just have to let go. The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had.  It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives.  It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone-but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.   Hmn... just a few reflections here. It may ring a bell because these sayings are rather common. However, I do agree with it totally. Read it again... and you will be able to understand how I feel...   That's all then... wow~ long entry! anyway... there will be more coming up! Special thanks to Denise aka Da Jie and meow meow for helping me to set up this blog... tata =)

       Am I REALLY a happy person? This question just struck me not long ago... I have been pondering over it, but my final answer "I'm not sure...” Sometimes I think not. I have lots and lots of worries, problems... and it's accumulating daily. At times I feel really tired... tired about thinking too much~ Although some may advise me not to think too much... but I just can't help it at times. I guess I may seem optimistic on the surface, but deep down inside me, I'm quite a pessimistic person. There's this sense of insecurity and fear that's always lingering in my heart.  Sometimes, I may appear to be a carefree person... someone who's humorous, someone who hasn't tasted any downs in life. I think that at times, people are unable to realise when one is unhappy and all these overwhelming worries that’s pulling one apart. Guess I can hide my feelings quite well?! Hee~  Today, I've never stopped frowning ever since I stepped into school. I think I'm not in a very good mood today. So hey guys, if I appear to be unhappy sometimes, it's not your fault, cos it's just me. Anyway, I had p.e today... while strolling on the tracks, I took it as a very good opportunity for me to sort out my thoughts. I recalled all those sweet memories... those times I spent with my CO "family" on the Pasir Ris beach, what we did, what each and everyone of us said. Each and every expression on everyone's face was captured and still running vividly through my mind. Guess these are the moments that will be able to brighten up my darkest days. I'm a dreamy person indeed.  I love to picture my future... where will I be, and what will I be doing. It's not bad to think ahead... As mentioned in one of my fav. books "Who moved my cheese"... Pg 58 (Imagining myself enjoying new cheese even before I find it leads me to it)  Hmn... I may seem to be talkative most of the times. However, when I start to tone down, it's the time when I observe the actions and the behaviors of the people around me. Regardless if you are someone I know or a stranger from nowhere... I'm just interested or I should say curious to guess what's going through the minds of these people. haha... maybe I should consider taking up psychology? hmn.... or maybe law appeals more to me still. ANyway... I think every other human being feels the same... we face lots of dilemmas, thus we must learn to be more decisive in order to overcome more hurdles ahead in life.  Hai~ maybe it's the weather today... that had instilled in me such a gloomy feeling. I think I shall learn to let things take its natural course.  Arrgh…really miss my beloved hairpin too. This precious thing will probably be buried under the sand in the playground forever. Guess~ as what ‘meow meow’ said… treat it as something which holds all the unhappiness and it will be buried there. Recalling what ‘Da Jie’ said… maybe it’s not all meant to be.  Anyway… thanks for making me feel better. I’m truly touched, especially when you guys helped me to ‘hunt’ for that pin.  Yeah! So stay tuned for the next blog then…

       I'm seeing stars *_*... I wanna faint.Inexplicable emotions running through me... my energy seems to be slowly draining away. Guess I should try my very best to look at the brighter side of life... yes! I will continue to perservere... I hope to see the fruit of the labour at the end of the day...  Anyway words enough said... not much inspirations today. =(

       Arrgh... not feeling very well lately... guess I should drop by the clinic for a check up. Lots of weird symptoms. I feel cold easily... even when the morning sun is shining brightly. My teeth starts to chatter badly the moment I enter audi. I have unusual aches everywhere. Oopps... hope it's nothing serious... I still wanna live a longer life. haha... Anyway, I love the weather today. Although it's a little freezy and you can feel the coldness penetrating into your skin like a thousand needles... this scenario reminds me of the time when I was in Hong Kong. hai~ gone are the days... when will the holidays be coming again? Hopefully this time I can travel to a Western country? Maybe for sight seeing and even for a shopping spree! That would be an extremely GrEaT idea yah...  Anyway... talking about co practice... I think I'm looking forward to it. Because of the Matsuri piece, I'm finally 'falling in luv' with my zhongruan. haha... I miss those percussion beats that I used to play on my kulintang (malay xylophone) when I was in Angklung Band. I miss lots of people... all my juniors, my instructor and surprisingly even the PFA(Performing Arts)Department. Felt really touched when I attended "Arts Alive" the other time. I just wanna say... you guys really rock to the max. and I'm truly proud to be an ex-senior of AB. Great music! Wonderful showmanship! it's really a tremendous improvement... and I really hope that they will continue to uphold the excellent reputation of AB. Hmn... but I think that there's 1 thing that's lacking in AB... and that's unity. Some of the members lack the positive attitude... hopefully under the guidance of the next batch of leaders... we will be able to see some improvements. Honestly, I do not have much faith in the next batch of leaders... so let time prove their capabilities. Perhaps, when one is appointed a leadership position... that person will learn to mature gradually and eventually is able to handle all the responsibilities in hand.  Hmn... I've lots of expectations for the next batch of AB leaders. Perhaps it's due to my perfectionist nature again, that may give others some pressure at times. hahahahaha!~  Okay... that's all...hope that I'll feel much better tomorrow... or else... *_*

       hmn... HoRoscOpes. How many of you believe in it? well, personally I think such stuffs can be quite subjective but after reading all those books about character analysis and all about the horoscope 'Cancer' (Crab! crab!) I think it's quite accurate in my case... the predictions on a daily or weekly basis are quite true too~ This is scary man... I wonder how do these ppl read each other's minds or to even foresee the future.  Received an e-mail regarding such horoscopes... and here it is:   CANCER WOMAN    When she is in love, she will act both ways. First, Shy and polite trembling  to be near you. Second, Attach to you like glue and trying to be with you  all the times. She will try to go home with you after work, or have every  lunch with you. It is O.K. if you like her too, but if is is not the case,  you will feel very uncomfortable.   She hates to be talked about or gossiped by someone else. If she knows she  will be very hurt. In nature she is a shy type, except she has been  influenced by some other Zodiac. She is not a brave or daring type, so if  you like her then you better be the one who start first. She will not accept  her true feeling, so if you like her you better tell her first.   She is like a musical note always change in tunes, so one minute she can be  funny and cheerful, and one minute she can be sad and depress. Other people  may think of her as "Over-acting", or "Over-reacting".   When she is depress, she will go out and look for things to make it up. She  loves money, and thinks of having "Money" as "happy", not as "God". She will  not look down at you if you do not have a lot of money, but she will help  you make money, save money. She is not an extravagant person and sometimes  will tell you not to buy her expensive and not useful gift.   She is the type who enjoy a long and quiet walk. Cancer woman also  influenced by the "moon", so under the moon light she will be fascinating  woman.   She has a constant fear for many things. She fear of not being smart enough,  not pretty enough. Even if she is not fat, she will not be satisfy. Assuring  her of her look would help, because she can change mood 4 times a day.   She is not stingy, but you will not surprise if you see she collecting old  or broken junks. She sees that everything are useful to her. She will find a  way to re-use it again some day. She is not a jealous type,but possessive.   The best part of her is that she will sacrifice everything for her love one  with no limit. Don't leave her in times of troubles, she will never forget  it. She is not a weak type, even she looks like one, Example if you argue  with her, she might cry her heart out. Once you left, she will wipe her  tears and start clean up her apartment normally.   She is a very careful mother and will look after her kids every steps of the  way. If she is a mother of your children, you are at ease, but if she is  your mother in law, you are in pain. Not to worry, this type of mother in  law will not let her own daughter being an "Old mate".   She could be moody and argue with you in many little things like many women,  but she always wait and want to take care of you. If you argue with her and  disappear a few days, she will be waiting for you, but not for long O.K.  This kind of testing is risky, try not to do it.   The Cancer woman need 2 things to be happy which are "Work" and "Love". She  can be live in a dusty house, but she can not live in that same house with  no Love.    Haha~ after reading this results... maybe I would like to take back my words at the start of this blog. erm.. guess this character analysis is only 60-70% true. Anyway that's all then... tata

       WaHahaha... had a wondeful... superb day today! Had a tricky listening comprehension exam this morning... followed by an interview by the ex co. of chess club.=X Hope that everything went well. hee~ Anyway, had a nice lunch today with my friends. It was a dramatic one though... with lots of climax in between. Firstly... clumsy Fz here spilled some barley onto her skirt but luckily the material is waterproof! So not so paisei... haha... then I accidentally bumped into an old Auntie behind me when I turned around to 'peep' if my friends were still behind. Wow~ this 'accident' had a great impact on me... I bounced up immediately... upon this collision. haha~  Besides this, I just returned from a gathering at Pasir Ris Park "Fisherman Village"! Had a sumptous dinner...although the food were quite expensive, but guess it's all worth while. In fact, this mini congregation was specially organised to welcome my friend who came back recently from Australia! Yu Yan... I miss ya man! haha~ not much changes... she's still as jovial and easy going as ever. This friend of mine... we know each other since pri.school days! wow~ so tonight is a 'childhood' friends get together session!  Had lots of fun and laughter... At around 8 plus after dinner, each of us bought a drink and attempted to climb onto the 'breakwaters'... haha~ this was the funny part... as usual we made lots of noise and ended up being the "BRiGhTeSt" lightbulb there. hehe~ became a nuisance to the couples who were enjoying the scenic view and doing some star gazing... when the sky is quite clear tonight. haha~ after a while, we decided to get down that platform. As usual.... clumsy ppl like us were all in slippers and we had to 'slide' down the breakwater one by one. ahaha... we looked like 'country bumpkins' man... This commotion we caused had resulted in 1 couple leaving the area. This shows that our 'wonderful' presence is greatly felt! -_-" hee~ Then... we decided to settle at another corner of the park... facing the beach. We chatted all night long.... had many lame jokes and shared different experiences in school. Goodness... I laughed whole night long... guess I have lost some voice. Oops... better keep quiet and rest my voice box a while before it deterioriates! hehe  At about 10 plus, we left the area. On the way out, I actually noticed a sign board reading "Beware of falling coconuts"!!! ahahaha... I nearly fainted upon reading the sign! Goodness me... such 'lame' signs do actually exist. The evil thought that someone would be hit by a falling coconut... keep replaying in my mind! gosh... it will be really funny to see such a thing happen! haha... of course that victim will definitely not be ME!  Anyway... when we were approaching the bus-stop just a few km before.. we saw the bus! Then we decided to catch the bus... so all of us ran like a mad person being chased by a dog! We finally got onto the crowded bus... and throughout the journey, the bus was driving at top speed... guess the driver wants to get home in time for a rest! haaha... in fact such a scenario reminds us of the times in pri.school when we had school excursions to the Science Centre! hee~  WoooOo... today's outing is definitely an enjoyable and unforgettable one! AS i always say... CKpS6A'99 rocks man!!! Luv you guys lots~   * Everytime I miss you... a star falls. So if you see the sky and it's all dark...It's your fault coz you made me miss you so much..." ;P

       What a lousy day... arrgh... lost 1/2 of my voice the whole morning. "Crowed" all day long. Thinking too much again... all the feelings bottled up in me. can't find a way to pour all of them out. Even if I had the opportunity... I'm not sure who's the right person either. Anyway... I'll try to keep myself occupied with all the important stuff and I wish I can just chuck all these matters aside. I have got my focus right and I'll bang hard on my piriorities too...  Watched the taiwanese idol show 'qian jin bai fen bai' today... Guess I agree with what one of the characters said." Meeting the right person at the wrong time "... may not work either. Anyway... quite true~ Hmn.. personally I believe alot in fate. So what's meant to be may be there for you to discover. However, if one chooses not to treasure it, then this chance may just slip away... even without one noticing it.  yup yup yup... soooo lots of mix feelings today... haha... all these friendships and interpersonal relationship thingy... can be quite bothering to one's life at times. How do you differentiate between these two issues? hmn~ I think there's no definite answer to this. However, I'll not let it affect me... I must be strong yah. i'll try!  hope that I'll have my voice fully recovered tomorrow... and to sort out my thoughts properly soon... lala... that's all for today... *_*

       hehe... finally managed to squeeze out some time to blog. Have been waiting for the mood to come by... Anyway yes.. Lately alot of things have been occurring simultaneously. So I'm trying to balance things up a little and to try and keep up or to even increase the momentum. Did some serious self reflection too... to see how I can improve myself.  However, that's besides the point. Recently I made some new friends. That's interesting~ hee... these ppl didn't look friendly in the first place, but surprisingly they made the first move in approaching me. So, as usual... I'm definitely ready to reciprocate to this friendship! haha... =P This shows us that we should never judge the book by it's cover yah?  hmn... feeling slightly better too... guess I've learned that we should try to let things go at times. By accumulating them bit by bit... I'll never be able to handle them. It's just too much to worry about. Sometimes, by worrying too much about every little single thing... we tend to forget the most important stuff that we have yet to handle. So... we should try not to allow our overwhelming emotions affect us too much. All these should be set aside for the time being. I believe there will be plenty of time to solve all these problems later.  Feeling more lerthagic than usual lately... I'm not sure why either. Maybe I should try to synchronise my body clock again...  I've lots of questions in my head too... but I guess the answers will come by as time passes...

       What a hectic day... tons of work awaiting me. Hai~ not easy being a student now adays. Who says that we just need to do our hw... get over and done with it? We still have our CCAs and pw... arrgh, this is getting on my nerves. I think lately I have been running into some bad luck or something. Lost 3 of my precious things... I lost $15 today. gosh... I spent the whole break frantically searching for it. However, what's gone is gone... I can't do anything now... =(  Yup... on the way home today. Something unexpected happen. Haha... I was nearly squashed in the packed bus that I boarded. GoodNEss... these passengers or rather lazy bums just refuse to be considerate enough to make way for me to alight the bus. Despite my many... and I mean MANY attempts to say "Excuse Me!!!"... the only person which was kind enough was an ITE student who actually helped me to press the "stop" button upon my request. So this comes to my point here... even if one is smart/intelligent... without the right character and positive attitude... that person = redundant. He really needs to do some self reflecton. ITE as some ppl may jokingly say that it stands for "It's The End". Not true... I definitely disagree to it. If you are willing to perservere, regardless of which ever institution you are in... with the great inner beauty... you will surely go far.  On a higher note... as I was walking home I passed by my neighbours house. Then I realised some giglings and some kind of mini 'concert' going on. I saw 4 cute little girls acutally trying to set up a small stage outside their house. Creative enough... they actually used 2 hanger post as barriers. ANd one of these sweetie pies started to sing aloud..." I'm Falling in Love... di da da da..." . haha~ but my sudden apearance caused that girl to blush immediately. I pretended not to take notice of them and continued my journey. Then I heard some giglings behind me... when her friends actually asked her why she stopped singing... she went like "wait a while lah... there's someone...." Upon hearing this... I could not help it but to burst out in laughter. wahaha... these girls really remind me of my childhood days.  I was no different from them. There I wore my big fluffy "keng keng" dress with huge agogo round dangling ear rings... slipped into my mum's high heels... borrowed her lipstick to touch up a little. And there I go... my little mini fashion show. hahaha... okay okay... I know it's pretty lame. But still it was really fun... amusing and 'self entertaining' ... hahhaa =P  Hmn... there's CO tomorrow! haha~ this CCA makes my day most of the time... unless when I'm not in the mood. Not forgetting my CO 'FamiLy'... they are the ones that really brighen up my day. There's this magnetic thing between us that can never pull us apart. Hopefully... we will always remain as united. Hmn... lately did not really have some time for a mini congregation... but I guess some things can be felt. It's felt in the heart and actions can't say it all. Yup...I guess we can understand each other...  Anyway... a super long day tomorrow. Up to 7 plus... goodness me... I think I'm going to fall asleep half way through the rehearsals. Hopefully everything will go on smoothly...  Through this cca... I can see my passion for music growing day by day. Really! I'm proud to be from co. Yesh~ so let's pray that it rains heavily tomorrow too... nice weather to escape from P.E. wahhahaa... that's all then. WIll blog again when I'm free. Really wanna make a chatbox and to load some music onto this blog. Guess I'll try to get it done asap... ciao~

      &nbsp;  Ah!!! Super super warm weather today! I think I'm going to suffer from heat stroke or dehydration sooner or later... argh... Anyway that's besides the point...    &nbsp; Although school was as stressful as usual, especially when there are lots and LOTS of rehearsals this week. I will have to endure this period of time and hopefully I will pull through. Sometimes I wish I'm invincible and would just suddenly vanish from this world. However, guess I can't... because I'll definitely miss the dearest people around me. hee~    &nbsp; Had an enjoyable GP lesson today! Never knew that GP could be so SO fun man... Our new teacher rox to the max... haha~ although we had current affairs quiz today... we were allowed to discuss in groups. As usual... we came up with lots of lame and crappy answers just to fill up all 35 blanks in time! wahaha~ had LOTS of laughter. I couldn't stop laughing at all... there's this laughing bug in me... haha~ can you imagine... laughing until you feel breathless?! That was what happened... I reached a point of saturation whereby I couldn't laugh anymore already. My laughter seemed to be 'deadly' contagious too~ seems like most of the people around me were affected by it. Ahahahaha... goodness me! -_-''    &nbsp; Anyway, we watched an extremely cute show today during Chinese lesson! The little boy featured was extremely naughty... but on the other hand lovable. haha~ oxymoron yah? The story was about a separated couple who&nbsp;were busy looking for another ideal partner. However... their adorable kids were always there to cause some distruption during their dates and all... hehez~ quite a nice and touching story. Wonder what's the outcome? The story continues tomorrow~ =P   &nbsp; Watched the taiwanese idol show 'qian jin bai fen bai' on SCV yesterday again! haha~ falling in love&nbsp;with&nbsp;that show sia~ so romantic... *_* Finally... both the lead actor and actress are together... hopefully they will be able to cross the hurdles ahead of them... hee~ I'm contemplating if I should get this set of vcd! can't wait to watch the final episode.... hopefully it's a lovely one. Anyway... I only buy idol shows with a happy ending yah? ahaha....   &nbsp; A continuation for today... had some fun and laughter with the ppl in A03... they are really nice ppl... very fun-loving and sociable. Haha~ guess this class have quite a good repore with one another. Anyway thanks to meow meow~, if not I wouldn't have made such wonderful new friends. ('',) Hope to get to know them better in future...    &nbsp; So so so... tomorrow... rehearsals~ dreadful rehearsals. How I wish they can be more efficient and to stop being so draggy... it's so mentally draining... hai~ I think I will have a super 'black' face tomorrow again. haha~ I'm anticipating the worse... so that I won't feel that awful tomorrow. However... guess with the company of my beloved CO 'family'... eveything should go fine. yeah~ so that's all then... will update asap. By the way... there's something wrong with my chatbox... arrgh...   &nbsp;

       &nbsp; I'm slEepy... I'm dreamy... I'm dizzy... I'm floating... wahahaha *_*   &nbsp;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   &nbsp; a weird day ... filled with mixed feelings... beautiful windy weather...   Hehe~ had a mini and a little pathetic Racial Harmony carnival today. Was slightly late for the Racial Harmony&nbsp;talk in the audi... Oh my goodness! So paisei...&nbsp; my friends and I thought that we had to be seated by 10 instead of 9.45. Happily we marched in at 10 plus, by that time almost everyone was seated and the principal&nbsp;had just begun her presentation. Wow~ thousands of eyes watched us like hungery vulgers waiting to attack small little preys... However, luckily we managed to pull through this tiny 'ordeal'. hehe...   &nbsp;&nbsp;Then my friends and I proceeded to the foyer after the talk... I&nbsp;participated in the Indian decor activity.&nbsp;Each of us took some coloured rice grains and laid them out according to the authentic flowery template that was placed on the floor. Wow~ wonderful experience... although it's&nbsp;a rather tedious job.    &nbsp; Following that... hey hey~ we&nbsp;took a stroll around the running&nbsp;tracks in school. So romantic right?! haha...&nbsp;we chit chatted along the way as the wind blowed in our direction. Goodness~ as though&nbsp;we were having a vacation on Cameron Highlands. It's&nbsp;definitely an experience that one should&nbsp;never miss out... I believe that such precious moments will&nbsp;definitely make&nbsp;up part of the sweet memories I have with my friends. In fact, such a scenario reminds me of the&nbsp;tittle of the book '&nbsp; A walk to remember  ' ...&nbsp;I&nbsp;would encourage you guys out there to read it...&nbsp;   It's&nbsp;a sweet story about family,&nbsp;FRIENDS and the&nbsp;different characters you meet&nbsp;daily. How one gain acceptance by proving&nbsp;oneself... and to stay strong regardless of whatever&nbsp;setbacks you have faced. It's a simple yet&nbsp;complicated love story... Extremely touching~ &nbsp;  &nbsp;Yup yup... I'm getting a little worried now... My dad will have to go for another mini op. tomorrow. I cross my fingers and pray hard that there won't be any complications... Hopefully the surgeon of Changi Hospital will avoid medical negligence&nbsp;unlike the last time. I can't accpect another blow... it's too painful to watch your love one suffer for nothing... . Hopefully&nbsp;after this mini op... another round of check up and bi-opsy will&nbsp;carry through smoothly too. I pray that there won't be&nbsp;any undesirable outcome... although chances are low... but there's still a slight possibility. Anyway, what I can do now is to give him the moral support and to provide him with some advices... which may be of some use. yesh...   &nbsp; tata... [=^_^=]

         Our life revolves around love... true? I believe so...   Sometimes, I wonder it's better to be loved more than you love the person or it is better to be the other way round? Many people often say that it's better to experience the former... I used to think so too. However, sometimes I think that I may experience the latter in a relationship. I guess when one is in a relationship, alot of time and effort is needed to maintain it. But when do you ever know that you are ready for it? How do you know that he is the right one for you? Are you willing to give the other party a chance? Is it a risk in the first place? Or if you really like someone, are you brave enough to make the first move? I guess these all some common questions that lots of us who are less experienced ponder on.      Personally I feel that feelings is such an ambiguous thing. It's subjective thus there's no definite defination to it. It's something difficult to juggle at times... However I think that feelings will live with us throughout our life, so it's something we cannot escape from. It can be something that we live for too.      Sounds scary yah? But I think it's quite true. All these emotions and feelings will help to mould one's character... which makes up the most of us. "Feelings" is so powerful that we are controlled by it unknowingly at times. So should learn to control it well.     Anyway, I  have been experiencing lots of mood swings. Alot of things puzzles me at times. And words can't express it all...     Whatever it is... troubles and unanswered qns will always linger around... so perhaps it's a normal thing. Guess no one is trouble-free right? hee~   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Had CO performance on Friday night!!! hehe~ what a roaring success it was. Oh yah~ I received a rose from my senior! so sweet~ it's definitely a pleasant surprise! haha... thanks for all the support [=*_*=]    I felt quite nervous on stage initially. But what deterioriated it was the freezing cold surrounding. Gosh~ I could feel it penetrating into me like a thousand needles... giving me 'frost bites' everywhere. haha~ okay okay that's a little exaggerated. But still, my teeth was already chattering badly. haha...     Yup... what a wonderful day. However the sad thing is that shi jie will be leaving co then. I'll definitly miss her presence! But I believe that will still be lots of time for us to congregate again. We have our whole life! so no worries... all the best in whatever you do! Must take care...      Yesh! Friends are very important to me... especially those close ones.(u know who you are... =P) yeah... although I don't say it often, but still... You guys are very VERY important to me k!!! *shouts* haha... will treasure you all!

       A Whole New World...(Aladdin's theme)   &nbsp; I can show you the world, shining, shimmering, splendid. Tell me princess, now when did you last let your heart decide? I can open your eyes, take you wonder by wonder, Over sideways and under, on a magic carpet ride  A whole new world, a new fantastic point of view No one to tell us no, or where to go, or say we're only dreaming. A whole new world,A dazzling place I never knew But when I'm way up here, it's crystal clear That now I'm in a whole new world with you.  Unbelievable sights, indescribable feeling Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling through an endless diamond sky  A whole new world, / Don't you dare close your eyes, A hundred thousand things to see. / Hold your breath it gets better. I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far, I can't go back to where I used to be /A whole new world, With new horizons to pursueI'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare Let me share this whole new world with you  A whole new world, a new fantastic point of view No one to tell us no, or where to go, or say we're only dreaming. A whole new world,Every turn a surprise, With new horizons to pursue / every moment red-letter. I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spareanywhere, there's time to spare Let me share this whole new world with you  A whole new world / A whole new world That's where we'll be / That's where we'll beA thrilling chase A wondrous placeFor you and me.  hehe~ really love this song to bits... lovely lyrics... melodious tune... it puts you into the dream world of your own. A song that has ironically been replaying in my mind lately. haha... maybe it's time for me to think back about the precious moment I hold... and to see how I can take a step forward&nbsp;into a whole new chapter of my life.

        Hmn... read this if you wanna understand me better. I think this analysis is accurate to a certain extent... haha~ why on Earth will there be such a close resemblance? Anyway... yup... A tyipical cancerian here. Yeah~ canCer Rox!     &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Ruby (Cancer)     &nbsp;   You like:  Spending&nbsp;&nbsp;time&nbsp;&nbsp;at&nbsp;&nbsp;home, family get togethers, making pizza with mates and listening&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soothing&nbsp;&nbsp;music. You dislike:  Violent movies, people who shout at u and being let down by those u love.  You're best at:  Making&nbsp;&nbsp;people&nbsp;&nbsp;feel good about themselves, listening to their problems and  being&nbsp;&nbsp;a trustworthy,&nbsp;loyal&nbsp; mate.  Deep down:  U&nbsp;&nbsp;want&nbsp;&nbsp;peace&nbsp;&nbsp;more&nbsp;&nbsp;than!&nbsp;&nbsp;anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;Home&nbsp;&nbsp;life is important to u and if  there's domestic squabbling, u become deeply depressed.  Your career:  Become a musician, journalist, interior decorator or chef.  Fashion:  Cancerians&nbsp;&nbsp;tend&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;have&nbsp;&nbsp;simple tastes: loose-fitting clothes in natural  fabrics and dark colours. You prefer unfussy outfits, but that doesn't mean  you&nbsp;&nbsp; don't&nbsp;&nbsp; like&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; glam&nbsp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;&nbsp;up&nbsp;&nbsp;when&nbsp;&nbsp;you're&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;right&nbsp;&nbsp;mood.  As a mate:  U are a gentle person who may be quite possessive of ur friends. If someone  lets&nbsp;&nbsp;u&nbsp;&nbsp;down,&nbsp;&nbsp;u&nbsp;&nbsp;may&nbsp;&nbsp;brood in ur room for days. But when u feel safe 'n'  secure, ur generous personality takes over and mates get spoilt rotten.  As a girlfriend:  U&nbsp;&nbsp;are&nbsp;&nbsp;sensitive&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;moody, so u like lots of cuddles and kisses to keep  balanced&nbsp;&nbsp;&&nbsp;&nbsp;chirpy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite&nbsp;&nbsp;secretive,&nbsp;&nbsp;u are shy to reveal ur feelings at  first but warm up once ur boyf gets to know u better.  If your boyf's a Cancer:  Tread&nbsp;&nbsp;carefully,&nbsp;&nbsp;girl. He's got an ultra-so! ft heart that breaks easily.  Not&nbsp;&nbsp;one&nbsp;&nbsp;for wild flings, he enjoys spe nding time alone with u & may even  be a bit clingy when u wanna go off on ur own for a bit.&nbsp;

        Drowning sadness...sinking heart. Experiencing some domestic conflicts lately. Feeling quite upset but all I can do is to tolerate and to swallow down this unhappiness. I wonder why can't they understand me better?    Anyway... I'm having lots of complicated feelings recently. I'm a little confused... Sometimes... I think that there's no point waiting for the answer to my qns... it's really testing my patience and I'm tired of it. Maybe I should try to accept the love and care another is willing to shower on me... or maybe I should persevere and wait for time to tell... these things are happening too quickly... too fast for me to comprehend.  My heart is a little lost too...  However, I think that  this could be part and parcel of our life... and inexplicable feelings just pop by... I believe that I'll be able to walk out of it soon.... yes.

       ..:.. endless road ..:.. (By JJ)       the truth is tearing up my heart i can't recognize this place the endless road without a stop sign can't even find a stranger this time...   why am i still holding back my tears in this loneliness there's nothing to fear every chord still seems a wonder how we could be together every time i ask if this would be the last...   why am i still talking to myself hoping that you will have the keys to my cell every song might calm the weather but it draws me deeper how do i get out of this i think i never will...   a crystal forming in the eye maybe this would be the last the winding path down my face till i begin to taste the bitterness inside...   why am i still holding back my tears in this loneliness there's nothing to fear every chord still seems a wonder how we could be together every time i ask if this would be the last...   why am i still talking to myself hoping you will have the keys to my cell every song might calm the weather but it draws me deeper how do i get out of this   i think i never will...     Hmn... just bought this cd by JJ. Wonderful music...by chance I found this song. The last track of the cd. It was 'love at first sight' kind of thing when I heard this song. haha... it can really describe my present feelings... my thoughts... my troubles and everything. The lyrics say it all...  Have been feeling really down lately... guess I'm quite a weak person.. although I keep reminding myself to stay strong regardless of any setbacks I face or any problems that comes into my way. However still... I can't help it. A person who drops tears easily... that's all I can say. But I'll recover... I'll stand up again. I will show them that I can make it. I will exceed their expectations of me. I'll tolerate everything... I'll definitely pull through.  Another pondering qns... is it wrong to accept the love and care from another person knowing that you may not be able to return the same amount. I know that such things cannot be measured... but in this case isn't love unfair? Or we should always shower our love unconditionally? there's a weird feeling running through me lately... Although I'm a perfectionist... but I realised that the world is not so perfect after all. I can try to make it one... but it takes 2 hands to clap and not everything will go according to your wishes. No one is perfect... yes... true. However... have I found the one that seems so perfect? Well, time MAY tell... I believe that alot of things are felt and words can never express it any better...

I can only depend on my antibiotic... my flu medicine may cause drowsiness, therefore I can only take it before going to bed. ahaha~ or else... I may just doze off anytime during lessons. arrgh... it's irritating to be sick. You sneeze all day long as though your nose is gonna fall off anytime. teRrible man~ spoil my mood sia. Anyway.... everybody out there must take good care wor... now adays it's a crazy trend to fall sick easily. Life is very unpredictable... so do treasure your own self and the people around you. By treasuring yourself will already be doing a good favour to your love ones! so ... that's all. My head's spinning... haha.. wait till I get better... there will be more bloggy updates to come.

      Had an enjoyable time yesterday at Marina Bay. The steamboat was quite nice... enjoyed the atmosphere and breeze over there. Beautiful scenery... as though all of us were on holiday. haha... we took several wonderful candid shots. haha... it turned out pretty okay... yeah. =P -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  hEhe~ just changed my bloggy's background. Yeah~ I'm quite satisfied with the template.... for a change yah? At least this one looks brighter and more organised. hmn... enjoy reading the blog entries then... OoOpss... by the way how do I add back the links to the different blog pages? I think I have lost them all... =X  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A poem here to share...    Emily Brontë    Love and Friendship   Love is like the wild rose-briar, Friendship like the holly-tree— The holly is dark when the rose-briar blooms But which will bloom most constantly?   The wild-rose briar is sweet in the spring, Its summer blossoms scent the air; Yet wait till winter comes again And who will call the wild-briar fair?   Then scorn the silly rose-wreath now And deck thee with the holly's sheen, That, when December blights thy brow, He may still leave thy garland green.  urlLink    urlLink

      ...FaTe...  Fate... this is what I believe in. It works all the time. We can make all the effort to keep our relationships going, but without this intangible 'fate' , everything may not turn out well as expected. Of course there are many others who do not believe in fate. They believe that it's they who control their lives and not fate. true... I agree to what they say. However, there are times whereby certain things are not within man's control, isn't it? Thus I think we should always treasure every moment we spent with one another. It's something amazing that had brought all of us... the different ppl with different personalities and upbringings together. It's not something done deliberately... it's just so ironic and at times we can't explain why this had happen either.  I was flipping through my autograph book... the one I had before leaving pri.sch, when I was preparing to head for a whole new chapter of sec.life back then. Here... was what one of my teachers(CKPS) wrote " Life is not a bed of roses but it is sprinkled with many learning experiences. Every step we take make us ever wiser! " . Till now 5 years down the road... I can still vivdly remember the msg he left me. I believe that it had left an impact in my life... and it's an advice that will continue to guide me through thick and thin. I think sometimes we should never take things too lightly... I can't guarantee that all good things will last forever. However... we should always enjoy what we have... a step at a time. It's not a matter of being optimistic or not. It's a matter that one day... you would leave this place with little regrets. Knowing that you have once hold these memories and had shared it with the dear ones around you. By having faith in yourself and the friends you have... only then things will work out. Without basic trust in the first place... I don't see a point to start a relationship. Efforts will just go down the drain... knowing that you may have lost time meeting another wonderful person out there.  We lost a PE teacher (SACSS) lately... and I believe that he will definitely continue to live in the hearts of each and every student he had once taught. He's someone who believes alot in tough love and we were probably still less mature back then in sec.sch, to realise his real intention of disciplining us. He always believes that a school needs a "Father" to keep everything going and he has bravely taken up this role of a "bad guy..." Often... I wonder why must we wait till the person leave us one day... then we realise how important they are to us. I guess that's human's nature, to take things for granted. Although all of us avoid doing so... but sometimes it's hard, because we are influenced by the things around us...  I think reflections will help to guide us along the right track...and I believe that although time flies quickly... if we truly treasure it... then we won't miss out the ppl around us.

      60 plus is what he is at the point of this time in his life. Today, then I realised how much he had aged over the years. Going through thick and thin with us and being the head of the family. I'm glad to say I have such a wonderful him around. Although domestic conflicts do occur all the time... and I would say that it is like a daily affair... but through these misunderstandings and disagreements, we have got to know each other better. Do not think that within your own kins... you do not need to make the special effort to understand them better... actually the truth is that they are probably the ones whom we have always been taking for granted and we may tend to neglect them subconsciously. Sometimes he makes me cry... but I know the reason why. That's not a need for him to say much when he is annoyed or unhappy with me. A few words... a little change in his facial expression will send the message clearly right to the bottom of my heart. I realise how important my dad is to me...   He was there to guide me along and I can proudly say that I'm glad to be from the Leong Family. I really do not know how long all this time and precious moments will last (not as though I'm trying to be pessismistic)... the fact is, life is definitely unpredictable. We do not know what will happen next. Only someone of a higher power up there have things planned for us... what we can do, is to try to comprehend them and to deal it with the best of our ability. My dad just told me something today... which I felt truly touched... he said" Let me fetch you when it's late... I do not know how much longer I can do so."   Of course upon hearing this... I said all those stuff like 'touch wood!' and all. He tried to rectify his statement by saying that he may be going overseas soon... but anyway the point here is, whether I misinterpretated his remark or not... what he said had really struck something in my mind. Guess it's time I really learn to spend more quality time with them... and to manage time better so that I will have enough to spent with my studies and my love ones (family and friends...and all).   Although we don't say it often but as long as you sincerely use your heart to listen... you can definitely feel the love those dear ones around you are showering you with. There are times we feel very insecure... very uncomfortable... very lonely... but as these fears accumulate in us... it will gradually subside because we know that there's someone always there for u to give u the moral support! yup... had the sudden inspiration to write all these after hearing what my dad told me. yeah! He is my role model... and I try to remember the precious advices he gives me each time... hopefully things will continue to sail smoothly... =P Hee~

       A quote:      The measure of love is when you love without measure.   In life there are very rare chances that you will meet the person you love that will love you in return...   So once you have it, don't let it go because it may never come back to you again...     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------     hee~ regarding this quote, I think it really makes sense to a large extent. Yes~ love cannot be measured right? How can you ever weigh it... in fact only your heart knows how important that particular 'someone' is to you. Sometimes, it's a little mysterious... the more you know that 'someone' has taken up a large space in your heart, the more we are so afraid of facing the truth. Therefore we end up trying to run away from it...      Hence, we may lose the one we greatly love and by that time it's probably too late to let that person know how much he means to you... the fact is, we can never turn back time. It's an irreversible hypothesis... thus we should hold on to what we have... and to shower it with love and care whole-heartedly...

        My Heart Will Go On     Every night in my dreams I see you, I feel you, That is how I know you go on   Far across the distance And spaces between us You have come to show you go on   Near, far, wherever you are I believe that the heart does go on Once more you open the door And you're here in my heart And my heart will go on and on   Love can touch us one time And last for a lifetime And never let go till we're gone   Love was when I loved you One true time I hold to In my life we'll always go on   Near, far, wherever you are I believe that the heart does go on Once more you open the door And you're here in my heart And my heart will go on and on   You're here, there's nothing I fear, And I know that my heart will go on We'll stay forever this way You are safe in my heart And my heart will go on and on

        Hee~ had CIP day yesterday. To say the truth, I didn't expect myself to enjoy it so much. We had a carnival made up of indoor and outdoor activities with different game stations and attractive rpizes to win/ This was all specially planned for our invited guests from the various children and old-aged homes. It was definitely an enjoyable one! We had our very own tpjc Radio Station with 2 lively DJs keeping the atmosphere to the MaX! We could make our dedications which consist of a mixture of Chinese, Indian and English pop songs ... which were played continuously throughout the whole event.   On my part... I definitely had os much fun netertaining them... Chasing after all those little kids, teaching them how to play the games and having to endure all the bursting of balloons that was surrounding.. (it was like a time bomb man~ ahaha) Anyway, it was really my pleasure to be given the opportunity to mix around with these kids. Although it wasn't enough to get to know them better, but I believe that my small effort had definitely managed to make someone's day better!   Maybe they are a little different from us, but their courage and determination to attempt the different games had really touched me a great deal... (no words can express it all k...)   I really look forward to such actvities in the near future, I believe we will be able to make it better each time. 3 ChEeRs for all Of us! =)
