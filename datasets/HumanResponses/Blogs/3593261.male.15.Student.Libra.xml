      I woke up in a cold weather. The sky was pitchy black and it was around 6.30am when the cold wind began to swept my estate. I was sweaty all over and the air con in my room made the condition worse....I just have a fever. I was grumbling within myself, with an inner expression of self-inflicting pain. I knew it! I can't go to Ngee Ann Poly today. So, I switched on my trusty computer and went online.  After many hours of surfing, I went to the doctor and he gave me some pills ( Paracetemol and Febricol ) and some tablets of Vitamin C. Well, I guess my immune system is weak. Hmmm....it was like " A huge army of Orcs against a brigade of human footmen ".  I went to sleep around 1.00pm, went online and chat with some friends. Took out my CD-ReadOnlyMemory and went to JunWen's house. My first impression of his house was a pig sty, so I hope I won't see that again. But I was wrong..so wrong. The mess got worse today. His house was in a mess. Shirts and Pants were seen lying around the house like dead bees sprayed by a can of insecticide.  I reformatted his OS and voila, got it to work again. Stayed his house till 7.30pm and went home. Took some medicine and studied A.Maths for an hour and went online again ( net addiction?! ).  Hehe.. I think that's all for today.

         I have not done blogging for many days already. Too tired and busy keeping up with the days' schedule. Right now, I am putting in some energy just to write these sentences...  Song dedicated to O level pupil : It's in Jap..don't mind downloading it from me through email or IM.  Real : by Shifo  Nagameru sora no shita Sorezore no mainichi ga maguru Kagayaku hoshi no shita Sorezore no omoi ga machi wo terashite iru  Boku wa taikutsu na no ni Nakete kurunda Kiga tsuitenai ne Boku ga itsumo omou koto  Kikoete iru yo Todoite iru yo Boku no naka no sekai de Tsuyogari dakedo Sunao ni narezu Itsumo karamarawari suru Demo, daiji na no wa "Ima, soba ni iru...Kimi no Real"      English translation :  Under the watchful sky Each of our days come and go Under the sparkling stars Each of our thoughts light up the city I'm only feeling bored But it makes me cry I don't realize What I always think Yes I hear you, Yes your voice It reaches the world inside me Acting tough Unable to be honest Never seeming to get anywhere But the most important thing Is the realityOf you here with me...     Not much done today...the sec 1 mock election sucks...yeah...they sucked...no, not just that they acted stupid on the podium, but they threw sweets on the sec 1...( god...they are implying that they are asking their opponents to vote for them...that was so stupid ).   Next comes PE....Mr.Singh did not come today, and we had Mr.Ng for PE...Interestingly, I saw a wet, dead bird at the shooting range while on the way to the Fitness Corner. After that, I rested on the Sit Up station and looked at the clear blue sky....I didn't imagine that the sky was so blue just now! It was very beautiful indeed...I wish I can share that moment with everyone.  Went back to class and we had to do Structured Essays for our SS. The class was pratically chaotic, as most of my classmates aren't doing their work.  After recess, we had our freetime. I did my Chem Prelim Paper and nearly finished it...but then, the teacher collected...I guess I should do faster..

      Actually, I am wrong...it's not adventure at all. It's misadventure. The morning rain has certainly spoilt my mood. The trip was skidded, things aren't going as planned. The rain has brought much chaos and trouble to the people.   Woke up at 6.30am, used the computer and took my shower. The cool wind certainly froze me. Went to school and the "misadventure" begins.  My team-mate, Nadesh , did not turned up. Damn..his knowledge for the trip could prove useful. Nevertheless, we strived our best to continue and forge our way to finish the trail.  Team-mates : Sayufi, Clement, Johnny, Ulric and me.    We went to some Indian shops. I can't remember what we did but we were told to wear those "scary little red dots", the puttu. I hid it within my fingers, cause I am very shy wearing it. After so much time spent on the trail, we took some rest and we were shocked to find Tinesh and&nbsp;his gang in a nearby shelter. I realised that they were lazing around and had not completed a single quest. That was very horrible. Anyway, I had some fun on a fitness corner, and I was kind of pissed off when Tinesh said " Now I realised that you're wearing underwear"..  Hmm...we were late for the trail and we had to skip some parts. We went to Novena Square and had our lunch at BK.  We went to TTS Hospital to study and went home. Well, I am sorry I couldn't express much detail, I was too tired. =)

      Finally I get to translate the meaning of the terrorists' intention.   Read here :     The jihad tourism season in America and the European countries  Oh Allah, there is no god except you, you are the great forbearance, oh Allah more beneficient and our more merciful, oh Allah learn our weaknesses and our small group’s treachery and our disgrace on the people, oh Allah you are Lord and the oppressed Lord . Oh Allah, Oh Allah! Take our foreheads to the floor. Oh Allah Oh Allah! Guide us to each good and repay our words and our actions.  My brothers, the boldness of America on us and its occupation of our land, and its demonstration to the Jews regarding us are their hateful crimes. Europe refused the truce of the prince of the militants, who requested nothing from them except that they cease their attacks on us. America’s demonstration to us, with the assassination by the Jews of the militants leaders in Hamas, one leader after another, are flagrant indications that this struggle has embraced a new level. An open opposite stage distant from all political maneuvers. Then these criminals no longer care about hiding their hostile intentions towards us as a nation. That appeared clear from their statements and its last the statements of the fool, the Italian minister, who threatened to deport thousands of the innocent Muslims, and will deport them only because they believe in Islam. My brothers we are at the front of a critical stage in the struggle with the ominous Roman alliance under America’s command, and this encourages us to rely on the alliances with the unbelievers from Asia and South America.  My brothers if we know that we are at the beginning of a new stage in the confrontation then what adaptations must we face? My brothers many of us are prepared for our the departure for Iraq or Afghanistan to confront of this massacring barbarism against Islam and the Muslims, and this a beautiful scent, but it displeases us that all military activities result in a destruction that will effect us and on our families because the millwheel of battle turns inside our lands and between our families, and we are obliged confront them on our lands regardless of the results at the insistence of our fighting brothers presently in these occupied territories.  But my letter is to the brothers presently abroad, and they find it the arrival of this difficult, I beg them to immediately stop now with me so that we think together in a loud voice how we can benefit from each other. I believe my brothers, so what is your opinion of the results that have been achieved practically only in Spain (not Iraq or Afghanistan). I doubt that you are disbelieve that its roots were strategic and that it had a big effect, and that it dropped a political system, and that it made Europe reconsider its decisions once again, and that it stirred the public opinion, and so on. Now I ask you were any of our child or our women or any Muslim sheikhs affected with this operation, and did it destroy any of our houses or did any missiles descend upon our families. The answer is a clear denial of those things. Now we must think of the next step forward and we say imagine if that it was not one operation but several operations and in several countries, so you see that the effect will be multiplied a great extent.  If we are Muslim brothers with a need to transfer the theatre of operations and confrontation to their land, so that the casualties are from their sons and the buildings that collapse are their houses and the facilities which are ruined are their facilities. If Armegedon is what they want then so be it but we will transfer the Armegedon to them and their land and their sons.  My brothers, why do we tighten our belts, and count souls in Afghanistan or Iraq? My brothers there are before us tens of jihad fields and which will have a greater effect in ending the blockade around our fighting brothers, and in the humiliation of these pigs; there are examples before us in all of these countries that for us; taking their blood and their moneys and their honor are permitted and this only those that supported America on us in the occupation of Iraq and the killing of our sons there and the violation of our brother's honor there. http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/iraq_orbat_coalition.htm  In addition to that the countries that participated in America attacks on us in Afghanistan.     urlLink  http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/oef_orbat_030701.htm      Also the matter need not be restricted to the travel of the brothers, but also he can join the jihad with present brothers who are actually there now, then I think that they hold a principle role in this battle that our nation is in.  My brothers, it is now April and the summer is at the doors, then will we see results from the brothers who plan for jihad tourism in America and the European countries?  And our last prayer, the praise of Allah is the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds.  I wish from the brothers the supervisors that they prove the subject to for some time - if they saw that - hopefully we hear from the participating brothers what he benefits and benefits rest of the brothers .&nbsp;   - I find it hard to understand why people would resort to such&nbsp;acts.

      Below is the full text of Bin Ladin's message "to the Muslim nation."  "Thanksgiving and praise are due to God alone, we seek aid from Him alone; and we beseech forgiveness of our sins from Him only; and consign ourselves to the protection of God against the evils of our souls and against all offenses. Truly, whomsoever God guides on the straight path -- and He puts him only on the straight path who sincerely desires to walk along that way -- no one can lead him astray. And whomsoever God deflects -- and He deflects only him who yearns to be deflected -- no one can put him on the straight path. And I bear witness that there is no deity except God and I testify that Muhammad is the bondman of God and His Messenger  "O Believers, Fear Allah, as He should be duly feared; and die not save you be Muslim" [Koranic verse]  From Usama Bin-Muhammad Bin Ladin to his brothers and sisters in the Islamic nation  God's peace, prayers, and blessings be upon you.  My message to you concerns inciting and continuing to urge for jihad to repulse the grand plots that have been hatched against our nation, especially since some of them have appeared clearly, such as the occupation of the Crusaders, with the help of the apostates, of Baghdad, the house of the caliphate, under the trick of weapons of mass destruction. There is also the fierce attempt to destroy the Al-Aqsa Mosque and destroy jihad and the mujahidin in beloved Palestine by employing the trick of the road map and the Geneva peace initiative.  This is in addition to the crusader media campaigns against the Islamic nation. These campaigns show how malicious are the evils they harbor against the nation in general and against the people of the two holy mosques in particular. The Americans' intentions have also become clear in statements about the need to change the beliefs, curricula, and morals of Muslims to become more tolerant, as they put it. In clearer terms, it is a religious-economic war. They want the believers to desist from worshipping God so that they can enslave them, occupy their countries, and loot their wealth. It is strange that they want to dictate democracy and Americanize our culture through their jet bombers. Therefore, what is yet to come is even more malicious and devilish. The occupation of Iraq is a link in the Zionist-Crusader chain of evil. Then comes the full occupation of the rest of the Gulf states to set the stage for controlling and dominating the whole world. For the big powers believe that the Gulf and the Gulf states are the key to controlling the world due to the presence of the largest oil reserves there.  The occupation of Baghdad is only one practical step of what the United States has thought of and planned before. The entire region was targeted in the past. It is being targeted now, and will remain so in the future.  What have we prepared for that? The Zionist-Crusader campaign on the nation today is the most dangerous and rabid ever since it threatens the entire nation, its religion, and presence. Did Bush not say that it is a Crusader war? Did he not say that the war will continue for many years and target 60 states? Is the Islamic world not around 60 states? Do you not realize this? Did they not say that they want to change the region's ideology, which vents hatred against the Americans? They mean Islam and its peak after all. They know full well that they will not enjoy our wealth and land as long as we remain mujahid Muslims. So, learn this and keep it in your mind.    One message to everyone : Osama's a sadist.

      Felt very bored today..      Impressive, very impressive. You know a ton of things about Final Fantasy 8, or maybe you just cheated! Either way you deserve this picture.   urlLink   Final Fantasy 8 (American Version)     brought to you by  urlLink  Just completed a Final Fantasy 8 quiz. I didn't knew it was so easy.  From Usama Bin-Muhammad Bin Ladin to his brothers and sisters in the Islamic nation  God's peace, prayers, and blessings be upon you.

I'll leave that for you to ponder....I know it's one of the "wrong" teachings.

       It seemed that more than 2 days have passed since I had done blogging......it's not that I have adequate to blog...it's just that I am restricting myself to "touch" my computer...  Yesterday, wasted nearly $40 on TYS....the books were darn expensive...but I don't mind paying price tags...Today, woke up around 6am and read through my physics textbook....brushed my teeth, washed my face with facial care, and chew a piece of mouth-freshtener....  Yesterday, I saw a terrible video of Iraqis beheading Nick Berg....gosh..that was so horrible...it reminds me of Hari Raya Haji...the slain sheeps...yucks! My friend from the US, just came back from Iraq...he was a soldier back there...I didn't believe he would make it alive to USA....since there are many gunfights involved that left many soldiers mortally wounded and dead...He showed me a website that shows a link to the unbroadcast videos of beheading....  Probably the most horrible of all, is the beheading of the South Korean, Mr Kim Sun-il....it was a pity...he said " Your Life is important. My life is important...and I don't want to die..."  Well, those terrorists are certainly heartless....they did this because of holy war?!&nbsp;What the f-k is wrong with them? Didn't they know that it is treacherous and evil to&nbsp;murder someone? They don't have the slightest idea.....it's misconception...a pure deliberation attempt to halt the community&nbsp;of Islam in the world..  Enough of that..if&nbsp;you want the&nbsp;video..ask&nbsp;it from me...I will let&nbsp;you upload from my computer.  Too many bad stuffs happened yesterday...and probably the most astonishing&nbsp;rude moment in my life was when I met a sec 2&nbsp;boy in my school....gosh..I&nbsp;took a step back and began to lost my cool....he was so impatient....and he acted like a spoilt brat....gosh....his behaviour can't be tolerated....the situation&nbsp;is perplexed...first off, he was a kind brat...and in the next moment, he was a spoilt shit.... I tried to be nice to him but I guess...it doesn't have any effect on the boy...like the saying goes " No point pouring water to soften a hard&nbsp;rock ".... I hope I don't meet him again..if i do...i would just&nbsp;ignore him...&nbsp;

      Series of bad lucks have hit me...today, lost to Sayufi in E.Maths Paper 1...damn..that was the most silliest thing I have ever think of.....I think I know the reason...probably it was the unpreparedness of mine before the exam..but wait...I'd prepared....so, what the heck is wrong? Is there something amiss? Something is not right somewhere....   Nevertheless, that's a lesson learnt....I will never, never ever repeat such mistakes...if I do...then, it will be an irreversible change to my mindset.. Not too much of days activity...except for the A.Maths Paper 2....I should say that it was much more easier than Paper 1...but to sum up, I still did badly...I didn't know why I can do well for the tests but not for the exam...pretty strange huh....Oh yeah...the social studies course was very interesting indeed...actually, i wanted to share the external teacher with my thoughts on China..but I guess I might spurt rubbish...Tiannemen Square...sounds more Viet to me....well, it was located in China...I could still remember the event...China students wanted to study in America and wanted one thing in their mind. "BUSINESS COURSE!"...that's right!  Actually, much of my knowledge about them was extracted from Readers' Digest..looks like Chinese people are money minded...no, not just the typical Chinese in Singapore, but the Chinese from the rest of the world aren't spared from this fate...  Hmmmm....I am just hoping I can do well for my prelims and O lvl....I don't care whether you called my batch a "guinea pig" batch or whatever shit it is......it's up to us to do well, right?......I wish the best for everyone taking O lvl..! =)

      I am not feeling too good today... Felt very pissed off by a sec 2 girl from my school...kept pestering me with maths questions..I got so angry. I think I almost lost my cool when she said this  "Chester i luv U! U r so handsome,sexy,hot  especially in Numb! says: no juz joking..."  Damn that bitch...it's so rare of me to scold others..but this time..I really got to admit it...I lost my patience..damn damn damn...  After pestering me with those questions, she becomes a rowdy bird's nest...my MSN messenger kept beeping endlessly...GOD! I nearly on the verge of insanity... I've decided to block her...well, I felt very bad so, after a few minutes of though, I've decided to "release the bird from the cage"...Well, she stopped pestering me anymore..perhaps, this will be her last attempt...  There's nothing special today...Went to religious class, came back and studied A.Maths and went online..and played a little bit of WC3...it's fun..especially fooling around with imbecile Asian players...I kept toying them with a great tactic...  Hmmm...I did taunt Asian players...maybe, retribution will come and have revenge on me..Perhaps I should be more careful with my words...I don't want to repeat the same stupid mistake again....   I wonder how my friends are doing...I assume they are studying..Well, I can't afford to lose....losing means I lost everything...and that, I have learnt a very valueble lesson...   Sometimes in life, I've just need to relax...that's what Siew Ling said to me...she's right..I should relax..but I don't know how...Broy did give me some tips...but it won't! Perhaps I should study less....it gives me a blow in the mind..especially screwing me up in the examination hall...

      I really liked blogging but I wasn't given enough time by God, or I didn't utilise the time properly. Feeling kind of hitched up actually. I studied hard, all my focus when on those TYS but I didn't have the courage to face on. I have been waiting for this moment but...it looks like I was beaten to death by a bundle of anonymous competitors (the exam papers). It looks like a lesson learnt...or is it? Am I going to repeat the same mistakes last year? Can I achieve back my golden age? I guess this is a complex matter to handle. Friends of mine have told me to cheer up. Exams means a lot to me. Especially putting your heart and soul to what you are facing next time. I guess it has just got the best of me.     I must learn how to persevere. No matter how much I drop, I must stand. I can still remember Ms.Ang praised me...my tuition teacher praised me...the praises of my friends...it make me believe that I can do it..Even though O' LvL is near, I must not give up. I am planning to start a night class for my friends. It's probably a good idea for a wake up call. Maybe it's too late? Who knows?    Right now, I am listening to Egaoga Sukidakara ( Because I liked your smile ). It's the most beautiful and encouraging song I'd ever heard before. I must forge forward....no turning back..the past can't hold me back..I am Ismail..For my future...for my friends...for everyone... =)   I'll promise all of you 1 thing....I MUST DO WELL FOR O'LVL!

      Tomorrow I would probably taking back my MT O LVL result. I don't give a fark to what the teacher said. As a C6 Malay Student, that phucker can't expect me to get A1. I knew it...she must be up to something, probably a plot beyond devastation...she's probably trying to get hold of me...trying to choke me to death if I don't have A1...use a samurai sword and cut my head as if it was a watermelon...but one thing's for sure...I know my standard well...I knew that a pathetic wretch like me aren't good in sissy subject like MT....so, sorry teacher, your time is up...Just don't underestimate me...Don't think I am that pathetic... =P  Oh yeah, A.Maths was very interesting..I loved it...the Trigonometric functions was damn easy..she taught us fast and with efficiency..what a great teacher..with more practice, I hope I can do well for A.Maths. Oh yah...Geography lesson wasn't bad either..it was very interesting..especially with Mr.Bay around...I got to know more about Geography...haha...thanks Mr.Bay =)
