       I'm at work and it's mean! I want to go home and be with Timmie or something but never mid. It's extra money and I need at the money i can get!    Paul who i'm working with is in a bad mood today and keeps shouting all the time. I haven't really got much to say to him, I don't know why I haven't, I think he's generally pissed off at me for being me and vice versa really.   But, on the plus side he has just gone off to Mcdonalds for some yummy food!   I'm going to a BBQ tonight which i'm quite looking forward to but the logistics are proving to be a bit of a problem!

       This is how brave I am, last night I slept all night knowing there was at least one spider in my room,  above  my head! I am v brave and i have cheered up a bit now.

      I know I said I would stop moaning but see above.  I feel crap today. I feel really depressed. I get depressed, usually in stages and this stage has kind of crept up on me. I've been feeling for a while that I just want to be left alone. Not from everyone but from the people who are upsetting me or bothering me. Recently I've been feeling like I want to scream in people's faces, just stop picking at me - leave me alone.  Tim thinks that I shouldn't be depressed because I am so lucky and he is right. Knowing this just makes me feel worse. How selfish am I to feel down when there are people who would kill to be as lucky as I am. It makes me an even worse person.  Yet again I'm fed up with Kristen. I fed up with me being so unreasonable about Kristen too. I'm trying so hard not to hate her anymore. That sounds awful doesn't it to hate my own best friend and that's another thing that's making me feel crap. I text her yesterday about 1pm and she replied at 10.30pm. I don't want an immediate answer, and she certainly never receives one from me but for someone who is supposed to be making an effort I don't feel much like she is. Maybe I'm too demanding, I probably am as well as being all the other things that make me into the bad person that I am.  I sometimes feel like just running away, so no one knows where I am and I am free. I would have to run to someone where there are no people because where there's people there's demands on you. At least then it would only be me who can see how pathetically sorry for myself I am feel and quite how much I hate myself.

       It is and I'm excited!! I have played with it a bit but not as much as I want to! Luckily I finish work at 3.30 and I've driven in so I will be home to play with it about 3.45ish! Hooray! I will do any cleaning that needs doing first tho.  Poor Timmie worked so hard to fix it for me and he has cos he's clever! Bless him :)  I'm one of those people who aren't happy unless I've go something silly to worry about. Today it is Saturday night. I don't know what to do. Kristin is at her sisters and Catherine I expect will be seeing her girlfriend and Timmie goes out with his friends on Saturday nights. I'm only worrying about it because I don't remember the last time I had a free night! I think I will spend it at my flat with my flatmates. I'm quite happy to do that and actually it will be nice that for once I won't have to rush off straight after work. I'm worried about it because firstly I don't want to sit and listen to Maddi moaning about her boyfriend and that situation and secondly it feels strange where I'm so used to spending every free moment with Timmie. Anyway, I'm happy, I have a new phone, a lovely boyfriend and tbh an alright life so no more moaning for me! :)    p.s. the font of this post is the colour of my flashing light on my new phone!

       The phone didn't come afterall. I was sad but it's not the end of the world.       I'm at work now, I don't much like being at work but then who does? I get paid from it so it's got to be ok. I was late today by 5 minutes, I also beeped my horn in anger at someone for the first time in Chaka Car my lovely car.               It was 8.55, I start work at 9am. The road leading up to the car parked was blocked solid due to one of the entrances being closed. Some woman tried to drop off her son and therefore hold up the traffic, this pissed me off cos i was late but i decided she wasnt to know that i was late and i should just keep calm. But then, she called back her son and started chatting to him through the window and then he opened the back seat door and started fannying around with bags for his mum. I got cross and beeped cos they were doing this for 5 minutes! then i gave him my best I'm really cross look, huh, that told him!       It's the house section day today in the Petersfield Post . I like the house section because Timmie and I get to look at how much flats cost (per month, we can't afford to buy) If we move in together in November I have to hand in my notice in September which is soon! I really want to live with him and he wants to live with me. We both want to be able to go home to each other, thats all i want really, i'm a simple soul! I'm also looking forward to having  our  stuff in  our  flat. I always sleep well at Timmies (probably because he is there!) but I'm looking forward to having a proper bed where the pillows don't fall down the back. I'm looking forward to having a decent computer in the house that i can use if i need to. If i get a new job i may be able to work from home sometimes and I could do that with Timmie's comp. I'm even looking forward to going on our first food shop and trying to stop Timmie impulse buying tear and share bread and sweets! We both are really looking forward to having a sofa, if we are at Tim's or mine all we have are single chairs which aren't very romantic!       I read an article in Cosmo the other day and it was one of those how to tell if your relationship is for good. I was so pleased to read that we fitted all the criteria for a long lasting relationship that i've decided the article must be true, despite the fact that if we didn't fit the mould i would've branded it a load of crap!

       I'm getting a new mobile phone today! I'm so excited!! I'm getting a Samsung e710 and it's going to be lovely! It looks like this        http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=tbn:rumRUN0fjvgJ:ner.pl/im/samsung/e710_b.jpg >       and this        urlLink  http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=tbn:COSnVDrGzvgJ:www.telefonguru.hu/keszulekek/Samsung_E710.jpg    >        Actually, Timme is getting a new phone but he only wants the sim so he's giving me the phone. He's going to do lots of exciting geeky things to make it nice for me to use. He's doing it because he's the best boyfriend ever! I know i sound about 14 saying that but I don't care because it's true!  I hope the new phone arrives or i will be sad :(

       I really do. Every Sunday night I go to the quiz get hilariously drunk and stay at Tim's. If I'm on an early shift I have to get up at 6am, 7am if I'm on day shift and the luxurious 8am if I'm on late shift. I swapped today so I would be on a day shift because I just can't cope with the early start with a hangover anymore. I know it's my fault for going out on a Sunday night but I really feel that people shouldn't let their jobs dictate their private life, I do that enough as it is I'm not going to do it on the weekends too. The whole situation wouldn't be so bad except for the fact that I drive for half an hour to my flat (always getting stuck behind a lorry going max 40mph) then I have to make my lunch, usually get changed and then walk to work for half an hour. I wouldn't mind so much if I could just drive for half and hour and then be there but that just isn't the case. This morning it all got a bit too much for me. I'm so jealous that after I leave Tim gets to stay in bed. Bless him, he is usually v good and gets up with me. This morning tho I just started thinking that as the winter draws in it's going to be pitch black on my way to and from Tim's. Don't get me wrong, Tim does what he can, he gets the bus up to see me which can't be very nice but for once I would just like to be the one who could go back to bed after Tim left. I feel guilty for feeling this way, I knew Tim couldn't drive when we got together and I try my best not to let it get to me but sometimes it does. I get sick to death of living out of a bag where all my stuff gets creased or I end up leaving something I need at Tim's flat. I know it makes more sense for me to stay at Tim's and I would much prefer to feel like this all the time and get to see Tim than getting a lie in and not see him. The good thing about all this is that it will all be solved when Tim and I move in together but for now I'm going to keep on feeling this way. As Timmie is one of the few people who reads this I really don't want it to come across like I'm having a go, I'm really not. Tim does so much for me in other ways, more than he could know. I just feel shitty and I'm hoping getting it all out of my system will make me better. Anyway, soon I'm going to post something that isn't whinging or moaning, I hope so anyway.

       I spoke to my flat mates from university yesterday. I left uni in 2002 and I haven't really seen them a great deal since. I didn't really have the best of times at university. I felt very responsible for my flatmates, esp one of them and she often wasn't very nice to me. I never really did anything wrong to her, I was just an easy target I think. This really hurt me but gradually I got over it but I'm still not over;y enthusiastic about seeing either of them. Anyway, it is time to see them. I do miss them and since we have left university they have been nothing but nice to me so I'm going to stop feeling so bitter towards them. I really need to work on my grudges. I didn't behave perfectly at university either but they have forgiven me. So on the weekend of the 11th of September I'm going up to Swansea for the weekend and I'm going to look forward to it!    I will miss Timmie though. I've never been that far away from him before. Sometimes I think I love him too much but I can't help it!

       I had a row with my best friend yesterday. A really big row, one with screaming. Recently I've hated her., For about a month. It's really been eating me up inside and making me bitter towards her and hate myself.   I'm not convinced that its all sorted out, I still have bad feeling towards her.    It all came about since I got together with Tim. The issue isn't Tim, it could be anyone. She's jealous that's she's gone from being the most important person in my life to Tim being the most important. I am cross with her because I have never made her feel that way and it's entirely her creation. She has really been hurting me, my best friend constantly pulling me and pushing me, I feel like there is nothing more I can give her. I am not the type of person, and luckily neither is lovely Tim to drop my friends for my boyfriend. I still need a best friend just as much as I always have but she hasn't been there for me. I haven't confided in her for months and as a result I've been feeling alone and like something is missing. Tim is always there for me and I feel so happy that I have a boyfriend that I can tell anything but there's some things I need a best friend for. Tim doesn't want to chat about whether lipgloss or lipstick is best (lipgloss def!) or about periods etc. I don't understand what I have done to deserve her to treat me like this. I have dreaded seeing her for the past month or so because I don't want to argue with her. A few months back we had a massive argument that she caused simply because she is jealous. I don't understand why I am being punished for her feelings.    When we were rowing I felt like she didn't deserve another chance and deep down inside I still feel that way but we are trying none the less. I lost my temper with her yesterday, I think she was shocked by how much she had hurt me. I was so angry with her, I don't often lose my temper but when I do I'm the first to admit I am uncontrollable. It washes over me and all I can see is rage.    To make matter worse, she is seeing one of Tim's best friends. I felt like she was only doing so to wriggle her way more into my life but when I put that to her I could tell that wasn't the case. Maybe it's a bit self centered of me even to think of it that way. But now I am jealous. I am jealous that she is going to get to know someone important to Tim better than me. I am jealous that she may know things about Tim that his friend tells her that I don't know. She complained that I had left her out in the cold and had stopped telling her things, she has been exactly the same about this and that is upsetting me. I said to her how would she feel if when I got together with Tim I didn't confide in her about it and she said she would be cross etc. She said the reason that she hadn't told me about it was because I have made it clear I don't approve of them. That's not the case I just don't understand them. To me, he stands for a lot of things she has spent years slagging off but she says she likes him so I'm open minded about it. I was cross with her shutting me out because I have been nothing but supportive to her about the whole situation and I feel it has been thrown back in my face. I'm also worried because my trust in her has gone and I'm worried that she is slagging me off to Tim's friend. I know it shouldn't be so important to me that people like me but it is and I really want him to.   Anyway, I'm going now, I know my rant makes no sense and is grammatically incorrect but its my blog so I'm allowed!!

       You know when a train reaches it's final destination and the conductor shouts out 'All Change', well that's how I feel at the mo.      I love my boyfriend, Tim,  more than anything and his contract for his flat runs out in November and we are planning to move in together. I really want this, more than anything but it also scares me, more than anything. I've never lived with a boyfriend before and it really is a massive commitment. Don't get me wrong, it's a commitment I'm more than ready to make but being a born pesamist (sp?) it scares me.       I also like living in my flat now. Not as much as i will like living with Tim but i enjoy myself. I feel guilty about my fkatmates. I couldn't leave until i found someone to replace me but i think that's going to be really difficult. Amanda (my flatmate) said when Maddi (other flatmate) mentioned moving out that it would be ok because they found me when they needed to. I think they were just lucky tho. I can just see it being a nightmare, neither Tim or myself can afford to pay two rents but if I can't find someone I don't know what to do.    On a lighter note, i'm also dreading the actual move out/in. I live on the third floor and Tim and i would like to live on the first floor. All in all thats four flights of stairs to contend with. It was awful enough moving in and carrying all my stuff upstairs! I'm a girl therefore it goes without saying that i've got loads more stuff now than i did 7 months ago when i moved in! it's going to be such hard work moving out again!!      Also changing is my job. Tim and I are going to live in Petersfield. I live in Winchester currently therefore i would like to move jobs to be a bit closer. My contract in my job runs out in December, i'm sure they will extend it but I don't want to stay in this job much more than a year. I would like to work at EHDC, i wanted to even before i met Tim but jobs there aren't that easy to come by. It seems that a lot of people would like to work at EHDC!        What to do? what to do? the only things i'm certain about are that I love Tim, i don't want to live in a flat share situation anymore. I do like my flatmates but i want my things everywhere. I dont want to have to worry that i'm annoying someone by my things being around. i dont want to worry that my things are taking over and i dont want other peoples things that arent to my taste in my house. Not that either of them have bad taste but still thats how i feel.    Enough of this now, i am at work and maybe i ought to do some!   Tara for nowxx

       This is my very first entry of a blog i intend to keep updating at least once a day.   I want someone i can write whatever i like and get things off my chest.    I'm tempted not to give the address to anyone and keep this entirely to myself but I'm a sociable person (or so i like to think) so I am going to give this address to a select few. Tbh, i think it's quite self centred of me to think that anyone would be interested in my life but anyway...   Anyway, first post done, hopefully the first of many
