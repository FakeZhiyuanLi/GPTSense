      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;The best college for me is one that offers a degree in Culinary Arts or in Pastry Arts, because it is my dream and desires&nbsp;to&nbsp;become a chef.&nbsp; I have always like cooking, I love to cook for people, and it makes me happy; I guess you can call it my passion. I am passionate about learning to cook and prepare many different kinds of dishes and desserts. My favorite things to cook are meat, such as pork, steak, chicken and beef.&nbsp; Some recipes I want to try are Cornish Hens Waldorf, Broiled Butterflied Squab chickens and there are some pies I want to make like Mississippi mud pie, peach cobbler, chocolate cheesecake and blueberry pie. I like to watch cooking shows on TV. Some of my favorite shows are Emeril, Saraâ€™s Secrets, Essence of Emeril and a lot of lot here shows I&nbsp;also desire to learn to prepare dishes from a diverse mix of cultures and ethnicities. The better my training the more opportunities there will be to help me become a world traveled chef.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The schools I'm most interested in are The Cooking and Hospitality Institute of Chicago (CHIC), The French Culinary Institute New York City (FCI), The Illinois Institute of Art&nbsp;Chicago (AI), Kendall College,&nbsp;Orlando&nbsp;Culinary Academy (Le Cordon Bleu Culinary program), Le&nbsp;Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts -&nbsp;Las Vegas, Robert Morris&nbsp;College.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The schools&nbsp;I am considering are located in Chicago,&nbsp;New York, Orlando and Las Vegas.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I may&nbsp;want to go to school in Chicago is because it is close to home and my family. Chicago has a lot of job opportunities&nbsp;for chefs. The thing about New York City&nbsp;is I don't know&nbsp;anyone&nbsp;there, but&nbsp;I do know it is one of the biggest food and restaurant cities&nbsp;that&nbsp;I know of.&nbsp; I have always wanted to visit or live there. The reason I want to go to Orlando, Florida is because I want to work at Walt Disney World making&nbsp;cakes and cooking food for&nbsp;people from around the world. The reason I would love to go to school and work&nbsp;in&nbsp;Las Vegas&nbsp;is because there are a&nbsp;lot of people having a great time and I want to be around&nbsp;happy and fun people.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In comparing schools, I am looking at whether they have programs in Culinary Arts and Pastry Arts and how long it takes to get a degree. I am looking at class size.&nbsp;I am looking at tuition costs and financial aid available. I'm looking&nbsp;for safe&nbsp;and affordable housing&nbsp;or if&nbsp;I will be able to live off campus.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;
