      We left Polonbaruwa and headed to Kandy where we are now....on the way we went to Sigiriya - and yes I made it to the top!!!  The mirror wall and the cave with the paintings of the Sigiriyan damsels were fantastic and the view from the top was absolutely amazing.   We also went to Dambulla to see the cave temples which were full of statues of Buddha after Buddha after Buddha with the ocassional Vishnu through in.  The painings on the ceilings and walls were amazingly detailed. We also went to Nalanda where the Hindu temple was in amazingly good condition ....We also stopped at a spice garden to get a tour of the garden with a guide telling us about the different trees and what spices they produced.  It was suprisingly interesting.  After that we had a smell, rub, taste test and a look around the Ayervedic shop.  Then onto Kandy, which is in the Hill Country, where thankfully the weather isn't quite so hot.

      After Trico we headed by Train to Pollonaruwa (where we didn't have coackroaches!:)), to be told on arrival that it was 36 degrees. The next day we went to the ruins early, 8am, to miss the heat.  We went out to all the Northern sites as well as the central ones which required a bike ride of about 10kms all up.   The whole round trip took us 5 and a half hours.  The ruins were amazing though, some of them were still amazingly in tack and it was mind blowing to imagine people living there around a thousand years ago.  I won't bore you with a blow by blow account of each site.  My favorite was the Tivanka Image House which is was part of a monastery with an absolutely huge Buddha in it.  Also, the Lankatilaka was great which has a cathedral like aisle leading to another huge huge Buddha and the outer walls were decorated with bas reliefs.  In the afternoon we went to the museum - it was around 40 degrees - which was great with lots of statutes from the ruins and models of the sites.  We also had a chat with one of the guards there who had AUD$5 he wanted to change into rupees.  He also stated that when we returned to Sri Lanka next we should bring out our little baby with us and that we shouls start practising the process now!!!!! I laughed heaps - however Jonno went pale and I thought he was going to be sick...... :) What a crack up....

      Well I am finally getting used to getting started at....men and woman both stare...I suppose white people out in the villages aren't too common as yet.  It is lovely though the way everyone says "hello - what is your name" - and no they are not always trying to sell us stuff.  I suppose my favourite memory from Nilaveli Beach was when we went for a walk aroud the village and a group of 4 small kids (probably between 4-8) all came running out when the saw us...the little girls ran up to me to touch my arm and hand...I assume they wanted to see if white skin felt the same as black - so cute.. :)  In Trico we went to the post office (Iain/Fiona please tell Mum and Dad a postcard is on its way to them) and when we told them we were from Australia they smiled and said we had won 10 gold medals at the Olymipcs already!  Amazing to be so far from home and people can tell us how many medals we have scored at the Olympics without us even asking!

      Howdy People,  Since I last posted alot has occurred. We spent an afternoon sightseeing arounf Trinco...went out to see Swami Rock/Koneswaram Kovil which is an ancient Hindu temple that sits on the top of a cliff - it isn't amazingly old since the Portugese pushed the original temple over the end of the cliff face in the 17th Century.  We also went for a nice stroll around the beach and then returned to our hotel for dinner.  On returning to our room (which didn't have a mosquito net - those of you who have been to India or Sri Lanka would understand the importance of this) to discover cockroaches.  We had a tiny fan and no fresh air since the windows were boarded up with wood (I hate to imagine what was on the other side!)  Talk about disgusting...we took some photoes to show you how gross the room was!!  Let me be honest and say that I did not have a good nights sleep due to biting mosquitos and our new friends - the singing cockroaches who were under the bed, in the bathroom and in the roof.  Luckily the temple, beach and views from Swami Rock made the visit to Trinco worth it :)

      Well well well, lots of things have happened in the past couple of days. That time has consisted of us making our way down from Trincomalee (which, despite some impressions is really a nice village) to Kandy, a city on the northern boundary of the hill country.  The region between is very hot and very ancient cityey. On Wednesday we travelled by train to Polonnaruwa, which was a top notch kingdom from the tenth century to the thirteenth century but is now the home of beautiful ruins, a number of touts, and warmish beer. Although when it comes to ancient cities I've been somewhat spoilt for life by my trip to Angkor Wat, I've got to say the whole thing was very impressive. I was tempted to go to the city of Anuradhapura, which was ruined by the Indians before Polonnaruwa was even built.  Yesterday we travelled through Sigiriya, a mighty 8th century rock fortress, and Dambulla, which is the home of 1st Century BC cave temples, so I was having a bit of an archaelogical orgasm, if such a thing can be had. CM was a little hot, so in hindsight I was glad that we took the soft option of a minivan, although the times I've spent in ultra-packed buses with conductors holding the rusted doors shut with their hands have been quite enjoyable.  It's been good to spend the night in Kandy though. Climate wise it is very pleasant, especially when compared to an oven or the Sun or something similarly hot like Polonaruwa.  Dissapointingly the only sickness I've had so far has been inspired by gobbling curries too quickly or having too much for breakfast (eg. 5 pieces of toast, fried egg, 2 cups of tea, 2 bananas such as I had this morning for less than $3.)  Might stay in Kandy for a couple of days.

      My early impression of Sri Lankan people is that they are very 'interested'. Being such a show-pony I was quite rapt to see heaps of people constantly staring at me, but I can understand why some people (young women in particular) may be a little disconcerted by it.  Having said that, they are a very polite and open people. I'm sure it partly comes from the fact that they actually seem to have some semblance of a real 'society' where television is not the best friend.

      Hi Everyone,  Here we are in Trincomilee after one night in Colombo and two nights in Nilaveli. In Colombo we stayed in an old English Mansion had great food and felt exhuasted after 3 hours sleep in 36-40 hours.  We woke early on day 2 to catch the train to Trinco (short from Trincomilee) which left at 6:15am to arrive at our destination at 3pm.....going to the toliet on the train was interesting to say the least... :) From Trinco we headed by Tuk-Tuk to Nilaveli which is about 20kms further North....we were staying in a cabin about 50m from the beach which was awesome....nice sand, great hot weather (30+ degrees) and water at 27 degrees.  I made the mistake of trusting Jon and ended up knocked completely over by the waves (twice) which was pretty scary since I can't swim!!!!  After that I decided splashing around in the shallows was more my style... :) We spent two nights at Nilaveli - we just arrived in Trinco (beautiful to the nose)  to quickly check it out before we head out to the ancient cities tomorrow. Hope all is well back home.... Cheers Christina

      It's already been 4 or 5 or 3 days since I left and this is the first chance I've had to post. Everything so far has been remarkably hassle free- all buses have managed to keep their wheels and the trains have all come in within one hour late.  After one night in Colombo to recover from jetlag (which we accomplished by waking up at 2:45am), we made our way by train to the other side of Sri Lanka (or 'Ceylon' for the oldies). With this crafty manoeuver we managed to escape the monsoonal, smelly west-coast capital and land in a sun-drenched, underdeveloped, lovely beach area.   I did some snorkelling yesterday at a place called "Pidgeon Island", which is considerably smaller than Australia. In fact it is only about 50m by 200m. But they (God or Darwin or whatever) managed to pack a hell of a lot of nice coral and fish in such a small space.  To save everyone getting too jealous, we decided to leave Nileveli beach for the war-ravaged multi-colonised fishing city of Trincomalee, where the air is fishy (in more ways than one) and the internet is in plentiful supply (ie. there is some). So we'll see what happens from here.

      Readers can now add comments if they wish.  Humour is definitely welcome, and cynicism is also allowed, but any comments designed to frighten CM (eg. all Sri Lankans are terrorists, the food makes you sick, God doesn't exist) may be deleted.

      Welcome to my travel blog!  As the title suggests, this site will soon be filled with tedious travel stories from my trips abroad and perhaps around Australia.  I depart for Sri Lanka on August 14th, so log in around that time.
