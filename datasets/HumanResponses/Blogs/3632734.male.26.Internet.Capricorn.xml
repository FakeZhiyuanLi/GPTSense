      UGH!!! TODAY IS FINALLY OVER!  Here is how the day went...  7:30am - Wake up call... Nicolas decides to wake up... ERRR! What happened to 9 o'clock!?  9:00am - Michelle's doctor appointment... Nicolas decides he doesn't want to be in the doctor's office... so we walk around for at least 30 minutes and about every 2 minutes he decides to drop his butt to the ground and pitch a fit.  10:00am - At the hospital and Michelle is with the Lactation Consulant Amy. Nicolas again doesn't want to be in the room... SOOO We walk around again but for this time it's at least an hour. I decided that he might be hungry so I took him in the elevator down to get food stuffs and NOW he decides he wants to be in the elevator the WHOLE TIME!!!!  11:30amish - Adam calls... THE SYSTEM IS DOWN!!! One of the servers puked and all the sites are down... It would have been a GREAT TIME FOR A NAP, but alas... I am the Jesus... Our savior... I spend like 2 hours fixing the server and everything is great.  2:00pm - Nicolas decides to wake up... I take him downstairs and make him Mac and Cheese... what does he do you ask? DOESN'T EVEN TOUCH IT! ERRR I swear to God... When he gets older... if I make him something, he better eat it or it gets the hose again!  5:30pm - Time for dinner... I cook, I clean... yay!  7:00? - Nicolas gets a bath... he cries the whole time... I don't know why... but I didn't brush his teeth :)  8:00pm - Awwww... relaxation... watch a little SNL w/ Lindsay Lohan... it was pretty funny.  10:30pm - I got a hair up my butt and decided to go play DDR... I completely suck now. I haven't played in a couple of weeks and it shows.  12:15am - I go to HEB to pick up a yummy treat for Michelle and to pick up cat food. Alas... I forgot the damn $$$ to pay for the stuffs. Do I look like a complete tard when I tell the HEB guy I forgot my Lonestar card at home. :P  12:25am - Back at home... everything is good...  1:20am - I now go to sleep... will I dream?   BTW - Some funny shit I found today on CNN... YAY!  "On the other hand, I wouldn't just pull up and leave there if I thought it was going to cause the whole thing to disintegrate," Clinton told King.  Hmm... I wonder why he didn't say... "I wouldn't just pull out"? HAH!
