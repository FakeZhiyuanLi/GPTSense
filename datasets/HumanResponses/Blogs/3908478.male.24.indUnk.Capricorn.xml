      I'm in the middle of a epic graphic novel  urlLink  Lone Wolf and Cub  , the 28-volume account of former Shogun executioner Ogami Itto and his son, Daigoro.  Having been betrayed by his enemies and banished from the capital, he wanders the land with his son as assassin in a state of nihilistic rage.  Yet at the same time, he maintains all the honor of a true Samurai.   I'd be lying if I said that the violence isn't awesome, especially given the quality of artwork here.  Who wouldn't want to see someone thwart a foe firing an arrow at them point-blank?  Anyways, what holds me is the story's constant meditation on the idea of honor.  Itto is seemingly smarter and more powerful than anyone else, often bringing his opponents to their knees on the strength of his cogent appeals to honor that transcends the specific conflict itself.    But isn't honor a cheap commodity when you are literally invincible?  It's easy to do the right thing when you know you can ass-kick your way out if doing the right thing goes wrong.  From what I have learned about Japanese culture, the concept of honor and face are especially powerful forces guiding people's behavior within society.  So much so that honor and dishonor are more a function of power and fear, because the very idea of failure is inherently dishonorable.  Bringing shame upon oneself and others often results in ritual disembowelment.  Itto wouldn't be so morally upright if he ever feared for his life, or that of his son's, whom he often tosses into danger without apparent reservation (on numerous occasions he has used Daigoro to bait his enemies).  It is instructive to witness figures possessing omnipotence of this sort, despite the utter lack of realism?  Ultimately, I believe the answer is yes.  Even though no individual will ever possess the dominance of a fictional warrior like Itto, everyone nevertheless finds themselves at a point in time holding such strength, temporarily as their own.  If humans could wield and dispense moments of strength as Itto does, with wisdom and supreme confidence, and honor, perhaps our actions could inspire one another to do the same.  Imagine, we could harness all our collective moments of power into one long string of perfect benevolence.  Disclaimer - The author is only half-way through reading the story.

      Currently, most of my time is thrown away staring at the internet.  I knew things had gotten out of hand when I started thinking that watching tv might be a  more  productive alternative.  I started thinking of all the basic cable I was missing while staring at the same baseball statistics  urlLink over and over again .  Why?  Ever since I was a kid I have had a tendency to like to stare at easily quantifiable things, things like maps and weather reports.  I read statistics of teams I don't even follow in sports I have never watched, nor have any interest in.  And the problem has gotten worse.  The explanation is obvious.  It's so obvious, I've been trying to type it in for five minutes, but I keep falling asleep/watching "I Love the 90's" on VH1.  It comes down to control.  Life gets more complicated...zzzzzzz....  I think I get sucked into staring at my computer initially out of a sense of bewilderment.  That quickly gives way to a strong desire to not face the fact that I've just spent 35 minutes seeing how my ratio of friendsters/testimonials compares to people I don't even know.  I know what you might say, I'm a lonely lonely man.  I wish I was.  That would make this whole time-wasting thing more justifiable.  The effect that the world wide web has on my brain is similar to what Fox News does to journalism - numbing the mind by being just elusively evil enough so you can't confirm your worst suspician about while you're actually in front of it.  Confirmation only comes with stepping back and giving it their proper context, and those fuckers know it, working tirelessly to prevent that moment ever happening until it is ridiculously late, say 12:46 in the morning on a Tuesday.   Furthermore, "they" apparently includes the Internet, which in my imagination is some guy who lives on the moon and transfers his incomprehensible lunar boredom to us.  That this particular interplanetary plot seems so obvious in retrospect testifies to the Internet and cable news' ability to obfuscate your judgement while holding you in it's clutches.    In conclusion, the most annoying part of this whole thing is that once something does pry me away from my computer, usually extreme hunger, I have NO IDEA what I've been doing for the last three hours.  Time misspent is regretful, but sometimes educational.  Time on the computer simply disappears, like it never existed in the first place.  At least writing a blog I can now remember what I was thinking.  Man, I was going to write about  Lone Wolf and Cub , but I guess I'll get to that later.  Until next time, my dear imaginary readers.  p.s. - Is Lacy Chabert a poor man's Jennifer Love Hewitt?  Is Jennifer Love Hewitt a  really  poor man's Audrey Hepburn?  Is anyone still reading this? p.p.s. - In middle school, all the kids would say that every corn-nut you ate took five minutes off your life.  Does that mean time spent bidding for corn-nuts on Ebay should count as double?  I just spent five minutes thinking that one up.  Damn.
