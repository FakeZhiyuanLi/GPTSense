      So we're still rolling.  $0.75 yesterday, sort of.  See here's the thing.  With Paypal, you can either have a free account, which allows you to recieve money for free, but not if it's from a credit card, or you can have a premier account, which lets you accept credit cards but charges you $0.30+2.2% on every transaction (even the ones that aren't credit cards).  So...  If I keep the account free, I can keep accepting quarters by paypal except the ones that are charged to credit cards (2 of the 5 so far), or I can upgrade to a premium account, but then Paypal gets all the quarters, not me.  For now I'm going to keep the free account, so if you don't have a paypal account, hold off on sending your quarter until we have a better solution.  I certainly don't want to upgrade the account and ask everybody to send me $0.60ish cents just to get the quarter...  And if you have a suggestion, something better than Paypal, let me know.  Now to today's contributors...  Yesterday's first quarter came from Jennifer from Washington, DC.  I'm pretty sure she's the sister of a good friend's ex-girlfriend, and somebody I knew many years ago.  She probably sees some irony in her quarter...  The second quarter came from Jerry who says he's from "nowhere you sorry ass pimp!", and I know Jerry from the online reeftank aquarium world.  Third quarter came from Matt from South Orange, NJ.  Matt, like Jennifer, must have gotten word from Andrew at Columbia.  Keep up the good work Andrew, and Matt, say hi to your family, and to Ben and Ned.  Feel free to tell them about my sorry-ass idea!  Ok, that's it.  We're technically up to a buck and a quarter, though 2 of those quarters fall in to the paypal conundrum, so really only $0.75.  Keep spreading the word!  And anybody with a better idea than Paypal, let me know.  MC

      Well, I got $0.50 yesterday.  Only $999,999.50 to go.  My first $0.25 came from my friend Reefland.  He makes awesome standpipes that make your fishtank quiet.  You can check them out here:  urlLink Durso Standpipes .  My second $0.25 came from my friend Christina at  urlLink Dynamic Web Designz .  She's a great resource if you need a webhosting and/or website design done.  I don't want you to think this is going to be an "advertise for a quarter" kind of site.  These are just friends of mine who I told about my experiment and they jumped on board.  To really get this going, I've got to get word of mouth going around.  If anybody has any ideas how to spread the word of this experiment in a polite way (I don't want to start spamming people or posting to web boards) let me know.  Since I didn't make $1,000,000.00 yet, I've got to get back to my dayjob.  Let me know what you think so far, and spread the word!  And remember, you can send your quarter by clicking on the picture of the quarter to the right.  MC

      Ok, so I've heard (or been pitched) a lot of "ideas" to get rich, or have a business on the internet.  Some were good ideas, some were bad ideas.  I usually just try to be encouraging of my friends, knowing their ideas will be a lot of work with little or no return.  Moreover, a lot of people have become millionaires on the internet, some with really brilliant ideas, some with really stupid ones, and most by just selling porn.  Not that long ago I was walking past a homeless guy on the street (I'm in NYC) and I put a quarter in his coffee cup, and started thinking to myself "hey, if that guy got a quarter from 4,000 people, he'd have $1,000.  4,000 people isn't a lot in NYC, a quarter isn't a lot of money to most people, and $1,000 is a fortune to a homeless guy.  So I started thinking...  What if I put up a website as an experiment, to see if it's possible to use very common internet tools like blogger.com and paypal, to become a millionaire a quarter at a time.  Have I thought this through?  Not as well as I should of I'm sure.  Anyway I figure I'll kick it off and see what happens...  So here's the idea.  It's just a quarter.  Most everybody can spare a quarter.  Send me a quarter.  You can use paypal by clicking on the quarter on the right side of the page.  Just a quarter, and if you feel like it your name, what town your from, what you think of my idea, I dunno, whatever you want to say.  I'll post every few days and try to mention all the people who sent me a quarter.  You know, "John from St. Louis, MO sent in his quarter and said 'your idea was so dumb, I had to send a quarter!'"  On the days I don't get any quarters, I'll just post whatever I feel like, it's a blog after all.  And if you don't want to send me a quarter, but want to send me your thoughts, click the comments button at the bottom of the post, and then click Post a Comment.  I want to hear from you...  Can I do it?  Can I become a millionaire a quarter at a time?  I doubt it, but we'll see.  And there's no gimmick to this, it's not a scam.  Just a stupid idea I had, but I hope it works...
