      hi.  after a weekend of me being in torino, dreaming of going to the sea, without available friends (because i cannot find the courage to go to the sea alone), i have had logged some events nevertheless even though i stayed in citt√†.  and the weather was quite cool, but i like it like this, sunny and clear and little cool.  and you should see this city now...mid-july...it is nearly vacant on the weekends!  everyone is so smart and they are either living or visiting the beautiful italian seaside!  anyway, i had heard rumours about this phenomenon and it is a bit nice without all the people.  i heard silence on via sacchi on friday, saturday, and sunday!--without the noise of screaching tram brakes, sighing autobuses, racing cars, high-heels on the pavement under the arched arcade, the ring of the bell at the hoochey clothing store downstairs, or the clashing of ceramic plates, cups, and spoons on ceramic at the bar downstairs...and i live on the fourth floor!!!! anyway, it was different, and nice.  good for sleeping!  and this weekend i have enjoyed the company of Edelle, the irish girl.  saturday we me at Valentino parc, the parc by the river, with here babies (she's a babysitter, too) and they are soo cute.  blond girls! we lounged, sang songs, and ate icecream and enjoyed the performance of Roberto the balloon making funny man!  this is better to enjoy with kids, that's for sure!  and i was not looking forward to seeing kids on the weekend, but...we really had a good time! anyway, Edelle has now left for the mountains, then for a month and a half in Normandie, France, so we will see eachother again at the end of august.  we have a good connection, i think.  she's a great girl with a great personality--she's honest. :)  and Edelle found out at 18.00 saturday that she would be leaving torino for the summer on sunday, the following morning at 9.00...a month vacation with 13 hours notice!  the life of a babysitter (in italy).  period.  it's a strange life.  so...the irishwoman did what any irishwoman needed to do...drink.  so...we drank and drank and went to another free concert featuring Iggy Pop for free and the Stooges for free!  i don't so much like this music, or drinking so much, but we did both.  and i like Edelle, so despite the music, we just talked and talked all nite.  and we went with Mauro Furno to the concert and waited then 2 hours for Michelle to arrive via bici. oi.  anyway, we finished our drinking at GianCarlo, avoiding the bum, bum, bum of the hard drum and bass music.  we drank the ever so famous Storm beer!  ha, i've never heard of it in my life! and then, before the sun rose, we continued home.  sunday. sleep, awake, go downstairs to my bar for a cappuccino, talk to Marzia and her husband and the drunk yet simpatico man who is in love with me (they tease that he wants to marry me!), Carmello who then invite me to stay for lunch with them!  so very nice!  they save my loneliness this morning!  ...then i do the usual...strut down Via Roma, window shop (it's a dangerous time here though-SALDI!, aka sales--the second annual) and then end up at Fnac, listen to music for a couple hours, buy nothing, and continue on my way.  Michaela had planned to make Czech goulash this nite, so then we met, made goulash and veggie platters and other toothpicked appetizers for our dinner "party".  all went well.  we did some salsa dancing because Sabrina, the salsa competition winner of torino was present!  then...arrived monday. hope all is well with everyone.

      okay everyone, i try to write a bit today.  last nite, i can tell you a bit about.  there are 3 nites of free concerts in torino!!! and the first concert was last nite. there were three torinese groups, i don't know if you've ever heard of them, but they were Subsonica, Africa Unite, and then Persiana Jones!  it was raining all day until we arrived at the concert and when the music started and the thousands of young folks who were in the audience started dancing, it seemed that the energy generated seemed to clear the sky!  the stars were shining brightly!  anyway, the concert was great because Subsonica played a few songs solo and then all of a sudden Africa Unite was singing and playing together with Subsonica.  so cool!  and then Persiana Jones overlapped with Africa Unite after they played solo a bit!  and then they all collaborated at the end.  Subsonica is a bit ska, a bit Sublimish. Africa Unite, who i like, are reggae.  one time i saw the dredlock clad singer of this group in Piazza Castello in the center of torino sing reggae with a full orchestra instumenting!  so cool!  very innovative--go torino!  just when i really start to hate torino, something like this happens and creates a new place in my heart for this city!  and so many young people go to this concert!  there are also some good looking people in this city, too, which you can only see at events like these, i guess.  haha.  anyway, Persiana Jones is a more metal group (perhaps like limp bizkit-ish? i don't know--a big bad bass guitar sound and some angry lyrics).  anyway, i have met a new girl from ireland (and i've accepted my fate that i am not so easily going to meet any cool or compatible italians--so i am meeting the coolest foreigners instead! and happy for this!). she is also a babysitter and is very very funny! it's sometimes strange how you can click so well, so fast with some people.  she is one like this!  i laugh a lot with her!  she told me about the censorship of the radio song "Fuck what i said, it don't mean shit now...etc" in ireland (and i imagine the same in the usa) where there is not censorship in italy...and to imagine how lacking in words this song is makes me laugh so much!  anyway Edelle (the irish girl), Michaela (the czech girl), Mauro, Michelle, Sabrina (the salsa champ), and a new guy Francesco (and Sabrina's cousin who disappeared, stefano) all went in two Panda's (the most popular box car from the 70's i think) to the concert.  then...three of us went dancing afterwards!  so good to dance.  and listen to what music we (and other 20-somethings)were dancing to (or boogey-ing to, as mum would say) all night:  well...what's your guess.....i'll give you a few more minutes to think about it:  well, it was all music that i knew all the words to...yep, daddy's music, mum's music, gary's music, Baby's Diner music:  oldies!  it was so much fun!  and the italians were loving it!  and i especially was loving it!  and only can you find this at GianCarlo, at torino's famous Murazzi! ciao tutti!  keep it real!xx
