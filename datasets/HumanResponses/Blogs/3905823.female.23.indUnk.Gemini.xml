       ~Seindah Biasa~  &nbsp;  Jalan pernah takut ku tinggalkan  Saat bintang tak mampu lagi berdendang  Saat malam menjadi terlalu dingin  Hingga pagi tak seindah biasanya  &nbsp;  Takkan mungkin kita bertahan  Hidup dalam bersendirian  Panas terit hujan badai  Kita lalui bersama  &nbsp;  Saat hilang arah tujuan  Kau tahu ke mana berjalan  Meski terang meski gelap  Kita lalui bersama  &nbsp;  Ku tak bisa merubah yang telah terjadi  Tapi aku akan menjanjikan yang terbaik  Agar kita tak pernah menjadi jadi  Meski beza dermaga untuk kita berlabuh  &nbsp;  Pernah kita jatuh  Mencuba berdiri  Menahan sakit dan menangis  Tapi erti hidup lebih dari itu  Dan kita mencuba melawan&nbsp;

      I was thinking this morning about a famous quote..  "Life without a friend is like death without a witness"  It's true that every human being in this world need a friend. i admit that my friends play an important role in my life besides my family...i feel lucky because most of them are very understanding and always support me in whatever i do..they know if i'm in a good or bad mood..my journey since school days, matriculation and university have made me to be more loyal especially to friends..i missed all my friends back at high school and university..wish all of u all the best in life...   &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     our picture at 6th college,upm..from left-ma,zack.faridah and me..and munchys plactic bag:)haha

      The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears.  The figure she carries, or the way she combs he hair.  The beauty of a woman must be seen from her eyes.  Because that is the doorway to her heart.  The place where love resides.  The beauty of a woman is not in a facial mole.  But true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul.  It is the caring that she lovingly gives.  The passion that she shows.  The beauty of a woman  With passing years only grows.

      happiness...well, somestimes as a human being we never feel enough and always try to look things differently and unhappy for it..what i'm trying to say is, sometimes we feel that life is being unfair to us whether we've been making every effort and work hard to be the best..we've been nice to everybody, being honest with family and still end up feeling stress and sad...  we can't expect everything to move smoothly...sometimes we've to face ups and downs in our life...as a young person in this new modern life, i'm trying to search myself..who am i compared to all those successful people..how they manage to face all the obstacles?..and still manage to be strong and successful....  i always relate it with my life today..actually i considerd myself as very lucky..i have my family that always take care n love me for who i am..although i know im not always being that good... being brought up with a simple life n always have a chance to know all different level of people make me think more and learn about them...i always think my self as a quiet person..i like to observe people and try to adapt with the environment...but sometimes people around us always missed judge and take things for granted...  anyway i feel something left behind..something that i haven't thought of....happiness is something that you can always share with ur love ones...perhaps i feel a little bit lonely..not much experince though, but i always observed n learn from others..it's hard sometimes to think about my past n what actually have brought me like this..i don't want to hurt myself anymore..the pain is still there, but i never blame anybody for that..experienced made me strong and teach me to be more careful..  i know happiness is there for everyone and we deserve it..have faith in God coz God knows....
