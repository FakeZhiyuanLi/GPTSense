      so as the title says pretty clearly, im saying fuck it to something.  what it is that im saying good bye to is an infatuation with a girl that i had for a while. and here is the fuck it part, im not going to beat around the bush here...i was extremely in love, for a reason that escapes me other than that she is by far the coolest girl ive ever met, with erika(name conceled for her sake).  for those of you who know me well, this is no suprise, to others--namely erika--this may come as a shock, but dont fret because after a long, and i do mean long, period of tormenting my heart over this, it is over.  i am finally able to truthfully say, without doubt, that i am over her...this is a feeling i havent really felt since the day that i met her.  but with the unknowing help of a new friend, kayce, i can say the latter statement.  now dont get me wrong, erika just hasnt become not the coolest girl that i know, so i mean im not gonna say that i would not date this girl in a new york minute, but im not pining over it anymore...i no longer feel like complete dog shit when im around her, knowing that i cant be with her.  so today, im happy...truly happy to be free in the heart.  i wish you all my kind of breakthrough, unless ur with someone whom you love or something and in that case have fun not being my kind of free, uve got another kind of freedom...enjoy it.  but for the rest of you, be free, let the lost loves go and focus on the present and future: you can't change your past, but you can make your future.  i love all you guys and galls!     here ends the love making session

      so here's a question for all you out there.  what if u get hurt really badly by someone you love or even people you love.  i mean just fucked over, and your down on your luck...what then?  do you shut off the world?  do you harden your heart and never let anyone in?  or do you wait till you find a person worth trusting again and let him/her in.  what if this person gave you butterflies, would that be sign enough?  or would you still say that you can't be with just one person and that you can't trust again?...you've been hurt too bad.  i dont know...this is a part of my life in multiple ways at the moment and i dont know how to deal...my philosophy is that i will always give people a chance, no matter what...but how can i get other people to realize that there good left in the world, that it's still worth living, or that im the right one for them?  maybe i have to start by convincing myself of this first. i dont know.  but i vow to keep trying and it's the journey and all of the failed attempts to live that make life a great thing. (ps this was a blog for the night of 29th or morning of 30th)     here ends the love making session

      do you ever try and be aquantences with someone whom you had previouls written off, and the person starts to think that you're into him/her again?  well it happens to me too fuckin much!!!  not that it's neccessarily happenin right now, but it makes me hessitant getting back into friendships with people like that. idk wat to do because avoiding the person takes too much fuckin energy and having the person start trying to get back with you is not acceptable.  any thoughts you readers on this topic?  im interested to hear wat u think.  im strong enough to say no now, which is a good thing. well anyway...i think that im going to devote this summer to doing a few things.  one is to reading a bunch of really good books by authors like vonnegut, salinger, and kerouac.  two is that im going to try to eat a lot of sushi with friends like emily and my bro and jarret and others...call me up if u wanna do that. three is that im goin to really focus down on my golf. and four is that im going to get as much play as possible, not womanizing, but just hookin up...or if i get a gf then that's cool too i guess...ive got nothin against that. but yeah those are the main things this summer, along with the unwritten, inevitable summa partyin. it's summa time biatch! how does love work? i havent got the least fuckin clue, and i like that. i need some crisco.     here ends the love making session

      so today is the first day of my "blogging" experience.  so far no worries and no pains...except for this one that has developed a habit for ripping at my heart...but that shall be saved for a later day, one with more time and more energy.  back to it...today, and by today i mean yesterday since it is currently 1:13 AM, was a nice fuckin chill day.  hung out with mike and chris and hooka and burton...fun times...chill days are needed to recoup i think. and if all the days were awesome, none of them would be awesome in reality b/c we would all be like oh it's just the same fuckin thing as yesterday and then the world would suck....oh wait, that is life as we know it...but wait what's this?  the only real way to escape this torment of living has arrived?  that's right bitches, it's SUMMA TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK SCHOOL ZONES, IT'S SUMMA TIME!!!WOW!!!! sorry to all of you who are actually reading this because im way too tired right now to actually write something of substence about my feelings on philosophy love and/or this shitty existence formerly known as life. peace to all and to all i good fuck-off    here ends the love making session.

      (brief textural note: i leave for a ten day road trip tomorrow, so enjoy this last post until i get back.  oh and to whom it may concern: I AM WHAT I SAID THAT I WAS'NT).  No more smoke filled rides blaring Music with people staring And long nights of finding  Out who we are And where we’re going. No more late night talks And park-side walks. It’s all gone out the window. You’re not here anymore.  The more that I feel lonely The more I wish that you could be Here by my side Be here with me. Your bronco’s cold from somebody Not keeping it company Wish that I could keep it company.  You’re so far gone, And I’m on the run From my feelings. Just come back to me And we could be Finding ourselves trying To be happy.  If I could have said the right things, If I would have been that “right guy,” Would it even change a thing? You’re so far gone That it’s hard to keep in touch, anymore. Admit that you were wrong, Come back to me, And open up to the world.  You’re so far gone, And I’m on the rum From my feelings. Just come back to me And we could be Finding ourselves trying To be happy.  Don’t you want to be happy?    here ends the love making session

      Looking around this white walled room. The coke can seems to know  More about life than me All I know is that  Without you, I am free. Without you, I am happy. And that’s the way I want it to be.  Not I, nor those close to you Deserve this type of abuse We’re not goin to take it, Not from you! It’s not on me That you are screwed In the head and in the heart Take your living, and  Do the opposite of start.   You’ve been bad. You’ve been good. Did you lose your mind like I knew you would? Can you bleed? Can you cry? I hope you bleed when you lose your feet, And go tumbling off the edge! Thankfully nothing’s left. Will you go tumbling like I know you should?  Not I, nor those close to you Deserve this type of abuse We’re not goin to take it, Not from you! It’s not on me That you are screwed In the head and in the heart Take your living, and  Do the opposite of start.   Tumble, tumble down. Don’t stop when you hit the ground Go on down to six feet under. Better hurry now! Cause I’m sinking closer  To putting you under!  You’ll be there with the rats and rodents Sounds like describing your components I hope you rot in hell you crazy bitch. Hurry home, but don’t forget to Crash your car into a ditch! Rid us all of your infecting life Lack the respect?, and I’ll gladly use the knife.  Not I, nor those close to you Deserve this type of abuse We’re not goin to take it, Not from you! It’s not on me That you are screwed In the head and in the heart Take your living, and  Do the opposite of start.   It’s not on me That you are screwed In the head and in the heart Take your living, and Do the opposite of start!    here ends the love making session

      Just gotta make it through Another day, coming to The end. It’s drawing near. Look up now! The sky is beginning to clear Time’s running out, I’ve wasted my energy. Spent  Just trying to pay the rent.  Guess I’m not good enough To make it through the day. Well I’ve not got enough To see your sweet, sweet face. But there’s not near enough Pain in this place To keep me from trying to  See your sweet, sweet face.  But paying the rent  Doesn’t suffice when You’re looking for something more to life. Maybe a something more  Could be a someone else. Seeing you walk toward me, I’ve found something more. But this can’t be true This has to be real life.  Guess I’m not good enough To make it through the day. Well I’ve not got enough To see your sweet, sweet face. But there’s not near enough Pain in this place To keep me from trying to  See your sweet, sweet face.  I never knew that life could taste so sweet But now that you’re here I find myself staring down at my feet  Going faster than I ever thought they could I see the pictures of you and me, Wondering now, what could there be To keep your feet from walking with me?  Guess I’m not good enough To make it through the day. Well I’ve not got enough To see your sweet, sweet face. But there’s not near enough  Pain in this place To keep me from trying to  See your sweet, sweet face.     here ends the love making session

      I’ve been staring up At this open sky. I’ve been wondering What’s left in life That’s worth givin’ another try? Keep on breathing! But breathing’s tough when I’m  Eight feet under and sinkin’ fast. My blood is beginning to permeate Just like I said. Wondering what’s goin to happen When blue skies bleed red.  I close my eyes And see your face So I open my eyes, Beginning to erase, And trying to disguise The pain that hides  Inside of me, When I close my eyes.  Tell me something. If I am smiling, Am I happy? Or could it be a cover? There’s something left to discover. I’m hiding something under my skin It’s not something that’s coming It’s something that’s been.  So I close my eyes And see your face So I open my eyes, Beginning to erase, And trying to disguise The pain that hides  Inside of me, When I close my eyes.  Maybe I’ll spill over tonight; Stain this floor with blood Right now seems like a good time to fly Right up and out, Way up past the blue sky. Leaving the pain so far behind But once again I’m blind To the fact that this won’t solve anything  But if I close my eyes And see your face Will I open my eyes? Begin to erase? And try to disguise The pain that hides Inside of me, Or will I bear on and kill  This pain that eats at me?    here ends the love making session

      I thought that you would always be there. Oh…what a strange ending to such a sweet story. Bittersweet it has become. This ancient deed would be better made undone.  Where have the good days gone? Those without pain or travesty? Those moments of freedom gone. An image of me lingers on. That “me” of then  Wouldn’t have to deal with this now, Wouldn’t have to feel your death,  He might feel free,  But that’s not me… I’m bound by the burdens of reality!  I see you always. I will not forget! You will never be gone so long as I’ve still got one gasping breath to breathe You’re no longer bound by the burdens of reality.  Your face, it’s right under my skin. It haunts me, entirely…eternity next to you. The best nightmare I have ever known. A ghost to everyone, but not to me, You’re here to stay… No chance to flee, When I’m still bound by the burdens of reality.  I see you always. I will not forget! You will never be gone so long as I’ve still got one gasping breath to breathe You’re no longer bound by the burdens of reality.   This burden of your bearing. It rips me from faith and belief. Your end is a fleeting misery. It tares and ravages. It parted you from me. But it can never take you, entirely, from me! These burdens won’t be reality!  I will constantly be thinking: Never hide away! Never go away! So I guess you will always be there. What an unusual beginning… To such a saddening story    here ends the love making session

      Swallow down so That this world might fade. This pain is usual…why won’t it fade?  Don’t you understand that  I’d do anything for you. Why can’t you realize that You’re holding all my strings. Come down from your high pedestal now! Your beauty instills this usual.  Ill swallow this gun tonight. Unload this lead, Unload it right into my head. Swallow down so  That this world might fade. This pain is usual Why wont it fade?  Twisting me this way and that, Does it feel good having this much power. The wind blows through your hair So wonderful…God must be there, He must have sent you, angel… You must be meant for me. But no, It’s just so usual.  Ill swallow this gun tonight. Unload this lead, Unload it right into my head. Swallow down so  That this world might fade. This pain is usual Why wont it fade?  Your eyes pierce me, Rip through my heart. Turning from me constantly, You find pain. You get hurt. Guess who’s there to comfort you? But to you…I’m just usual.  Ill swallow this gun tonight. Unload this lead, Unload it right into my head. Swallow down so  That this world might fade. This pain is usual…why wont it fade?  Swallow down so That this world might fade. This pain is usual, and it will fade.     here ends the love making session

      “One guy’s not enough”  Those fatal words that you said Falling faster than my heart,  Encased in lead. My love is plunging deeper down, Than I have ever known. But wait, don’t you look down now, Cause it’s breaking on the ground.  So tell me… What does one guy have to do To be with you? Should I beg? Should I crawl? Would it even help at all If I let you have it all?  Breaking down that wall around you It has been there for too long. It’s time to let your self be free Come on! Come on! It’s something we can find. There is more to life Than these damn deceptions and lies. Please tell me what I can do To just show you?  So tell me… What does one guy have to do To be with you? Should I beg? Should I crawl? Would it even help at all If I let you have it all?  Please!…Oh Please!!!…Let Me into your heart…Let Me in and we could start To understand your mysteries. I’m beginning to see Why it’s not me What do I have to do To make it up to you? So can I ask you…  Please!!!…Tell me… What does one guy have to do To be with you? Should I beg? Should I crawl? Would it even help at all If I let you have it all?  If I gave you all of me Nothing left for me to see But dependency Lying directly on you. Would you take it And keep it safe? Or would crush me? Could I interest you In another casualty?  What do I have to do To prove it to you? Prove that I’m the one All that other shit is Better left undone. Don’t fuckin’ tear my heart! I’m tired and weary. Keep on pushing And you’re bound to see A side of me that’s better left unseen.  What does one guy have to do To be with you? Should I beg? Should I crawl? Would it even help at all If I let you have it all? NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    here ends the love making session

      My eyes burn From tears flowing down, Tears flowing Since you’re not around. You’ve been gone since The day you left. But what do I do When I’ve got nothing left?  It’s not so hard to Understand that I’d do Anything for you. Why can’t we be… Why can’t you see That I LOVE YOU!?!  Some called it obsessive And some just called it love… But I did NOT give a fuck What people said about us. We were off somewhere, Off in our own little world, Cause I was your special boy And you were my only girl.  It’s not so hard to Understand that I’d do Anything for you. Why can’t we be… Why can’t you see That I LOVE YOU!?!  My eyes still burn, Sometimes they must. Tears still flow down, I’m not about to bust. I’ve got more left than The days passing take. Im enduring more than I ever thought I could take.  It’s not so hard to Understand that I’d do Anything for you. Why can’t we be… Why can’t you see That I love you?  I LOVE YOU!!!   here ends the love making session

      Time’s running rampant, And this sand’s sinkin fast. I’m is set an hour slow, And you’re an hour fast Cause I’m being Stupid and reckless, Broken and thoughtless, Brazen and cocky It’s the same old story: You never know what you’ve got until it’s gone!  Just remember Those good times we had Just remember The funny things we said But don’t remember The times that were sad Just remember It’s all in the past  Time’s not gonna wait, And my sand’s sinkin fast. That me that you did know, It’s gone past,  It’s gone right out the window! Don’t make it hasty Take your time and don’t judge so fast.  Just remember Those good times we had Just remember The funny things we said But don’t remember The times that were sad Just remember It’s all in the past  Don’t live by the hour-glass Don’t let our sand run fast Allow me to come through, let our hours be sweet The world keep’s turning Each day a new So don’t keep on burning In some day that’s through.  Just remember Those good times we had Just remember The funny things we said But don’t remember The times that were sad Just remember It’s all in the past     here ends the love making session
