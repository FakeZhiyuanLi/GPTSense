      The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller  buildings but shorter tempers, wider freeways, but narrower  viewpoints. We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but  enjoy less. We have bigger houses and smaller families, more  conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but less  sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet  more problems, more medicine, but less wellness.  We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly,  laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too  late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much,  and pray too seldom. We have multiplied our possessions, but  reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and  hate too often.  We've learned how to make a living, but not a life. We've  added years to life not life to years. We've been all the way  to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to  meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not inner  space. We've done larger things, but not better things.  We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul.. We've  conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but  learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less. We've learned  to rush, but not to wait. We build more computers to hold  more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we  communicate less and less.  These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men  and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships.  These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier  houses, but broken homes. These are days of quick trips,  disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands,  overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer,  to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is much in the  showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time when  technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you  can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit  delete.  Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because they  are not going to be around forever. Remember, say a kind word  to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little  person soon will grow up and leave your side. Remember, to  give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the  only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't  cost a cent.  Remember, to say, "I love you" to your partner and your loved  ones, but most of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will  mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you. Remember to  hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person  will not be there again. Give time to love, give time to  speak, and give time to share the precious thoughts in your  mind.  Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by  the moments that take our breath away.   -George Carlin-

      I headed south to Virginia this past weekend for a reunion. In addition, we visited the family homestead built over 150 years ago on 350 acres in Garden Creek. I am a big fan of bluegrass, so my aunt and uncle took my family and I to a bluegrass festival at The Breaks Interstate Park.   urlLink      urlLink

       urlLink    Radar  urlLink     Prior to our move I had been a volunteer at Nature's Nursery Center for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation Education in Ohio. Today I started at Wildside Rehabilitation in Eaton Rapids, Michigan. Both of the facilities accept approximately 1500 orphaned or injured wild animals each year. The majority of the animals are then re-released once they have healed or matured.

      In a speech delivered during the signing of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2005 Bush stated:  "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we."
