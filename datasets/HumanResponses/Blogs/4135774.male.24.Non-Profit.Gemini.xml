       Fires of guilt coursing   through my veins, into   my soul, evoking and   awaking memories of pain   and doubts of life that   was never rich nor full   not even worth .... remembering!!!      Looking into the blankness   unfettered eyes that stare   at my every spoonful   in raggidy awe, the children   of the streets and alleys   whose inkling of hope is   a piece of bread ... they hunger!!!      Now in to the eyes of leaders   of politicians and diabtribes   who carry the slogan expressing   they fight for the peoples' rights   what people? whose people?   can words assuage hunger?   can promises heal ... the children!!!      Is this what they call life?   is this what they call hope?   Is this what they call promises?   and while the children of the streets   await for the fulfillment   they continue to hunger and lose hope   only one question remains... unanswered still...      WHAT HAVE WE DONE???

         Wish it was you   to fill my days with laughter   to make each evening   a night of utter splendor   to hold my hand   and calm all my fears   to greet me each morning   with your smiling eyes...      Wish it was you   to hug me when thunder rolls   to reassure me always   as lightning streaks the skies   you to dry all my tears   when things go all wrong   as they often do   in my dreary life...      How i wish it was you   to be there with me each time   when i need someone to listen   to catch me if i fall   now i make this wish    so you would simply know   that all i ever wished for   is for me and you...

       In the rise of   midsummer sun   the swallows fly   to distant horizons   to find nesting places   to find home...   to find solace...   to find warmth...      So does my heart   yearning for a place   to call home   for i found it   in your eyes...   in your smile...   in your love...      So i pray   to all the Gods   i know and to Him   to always let me see   my way to you...

       The mornings that pass   so swiftly through   bringing new hope   bringing new tidings   of joy and laughter...   Life is a constant   fight for happiness   a struggle to be   the very best we are   and can ever be...   This as we open our eyes   to the glory of   each new morn   open your heart   to the challenges   to the beauty   that life is so short   and that we must   give it always our   BEST...

       Here... there...   today... tomorrow...   whatever, whenever...   in anything, love can grow...   for love need not time   nor place, not incident   but hearts that're entwined   and a kiss that is meant....      Love need just a chance   an acceptance from someone   then the hearts can dance   to a music heard by none   Love simply is   a being of its own   for love like time flies   to all parts of the unknown      Here... now...   there...tomorrow...   where ever love grows...   where ever love is...

            Like a pillar of stone may   crumble to dust and blown   or stand solid like granite   its due...in time....      Like a flower in full bloom   mistify the eyes and   capture a soul forever   or fade... in time      Like life may come to waste   that fleets from grasp   making neither a ripple   mean nothing... in time      Like a bird in flight   soar to heights unknown   or fall to jagged rocks   only... in time      Love like time   fleets away from us   unless we hold it tight   make it grow... in time
