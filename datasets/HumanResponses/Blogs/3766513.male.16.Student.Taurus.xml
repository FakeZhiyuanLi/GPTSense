                The year was 2058, the human race had already mastered genetic mutation and mutated half of the human race into fishes, and their race added meatl parts to their body, making them a very powerful race, the humans were jealous of the fishes as they were smarter, stronger, faster and the works.            The Fishes indeed have more powerful technology but they have a minor flaw, they cannot breath out of water, so the human only had to drain out the water on the Fishes side of the planet. their race slowly died out and they decided to input metal organs in their body so that they will not die out, they managed to save most of their kind and declared war on the humans.            At the barrier of the two sides, Thomas's stomach was growling, he wished that his partner would hurry up and take over his place so he could eat some dinner, he was thinking about what he would eat when the sensors beeped alarmingly.Thomas creeped quietly and saw that the fishes were beside his outpost, he sweared and thought about his choices, he sound the alarm and they kill him or continue to hide and the human race get decimated.             He cursed again for he did not get any last food and sounded the alarm. the soldiers who heard the alarm waked their partner up, who cursed at being awaken up so early in the morning. They quickly took their battle formations and defende their base. While the soldiers were denfeding their base, the others sent distress signals to other bases for help.             The base was over runed by the time the distress signals were sent and the base fell quickly into the handes of the Fishes who renamed their clan, "The Metal Fish". Slowly, one by one the bases were destroyed and all that was left was heavily armored. the Metal Fish used stealth and over ran that base but the base was not destroyed, The Metal Fish used it as their base and rebuild the tanks that were destroyed and aimed for the last base, which was the only defense left of the human race.             But unknown to them, that base's defense was the best, with each soldier given an exoskeleton. their long range sensors detected them a 1000 km away and prepared for the battle of their life.........    P.S pls post a comment abt this story, if the comments are good, i'll make the other two parts, if not, i'll just make another part only
