      The season of  urlLink 24  picked back up last night, with I believe its fifteenth episode, after a 1 month vacation to make room for  urlLink reality tv programming . Man was it a good episode, nothing like  urlLink hemorrhaging  noses and mouths to provide great programming. Early episodes left me thinking that this season was a little less exciting that the previous two, but this episode really got things moving. It seemed like every other scene was another "Oh my crap, I can't believe that just happened" moment, with the one exception where Amador got blown up by that car bomb. Though having the driver be an assassin may have been easier and cleaner, and would've prevented the loss of a perfectly decent lackey. Big thumbs up on this weeks episode, I look forward to next week.  -richard out and remember to take out the trash

      Low carb diets... more like " urlLink trying to starve myself diets ." There's something to be said about these things, but mostly because most of us Americans consume too many sugary foods and drinks. Heck, I have friends who go through a twelve pack of  urlLink Mountain Dew  in a day and a half. I used to go through half a twelver of Pepsi a day myself. Here's the deal though, a calorie is a calorie, if you can find a way to burn this stuff off, it shouldn't matter if you're loading yourself up with starches or protein-rich beans as long as you can actually get off your flabby butt and do some  urlLink exercises . I think the funniest thing about these diets are these ridiculous commercials I see on late night cable television, whether it be a 30 second spot or a 30 minute infomercial. Usually they have nothing to do with a low-carb diet or even an Atkins diet, often they're some silly supplement or goofy herb from Asia that promises to improve your metabolism promising to help you lose 15-50 pounds. Obviously these silly  urlLink products  exist because the low carb diet fad actually does work, but it takes a lot of effort and doesn't work with everyone, so there is this "quick out" that people were hoping for in something as easy as a pill. Anyone remember  urlLink Fen-phen ? Easy outs don't exist people, just eat correctly and get off your butt and do something physically constructive.  - richard out

      Okay, so  urlLink NCAA Basketball . I haven't even mentioned this yet, but the  urlLink tourney  is great fun and if you don't agree, I hate you. Turns out I picked two teams correctly, Oklahoma State and Duke. My long shot #1 seed was  urlLink Stanford , though I should have stuck to the smart money and picked UConn. My other miss was Kentucky, the overall #1 seed going into the tournament. Can't win em all eh? I'd like to give my team a nice hook 'em for another good season, great job Texas, let's get back to the final four next year.  -richard out and remember, Donald Rumsfeld is an evil, evil man

      So I was driving home from work yesterday morning in the middle of a huge  urlLink thunderstorm . Rain and wind was all over the place causing me to get  urlLink really super pissed  at the silly weather. Anyhow, my driver side wiper literally bent in half on its way up. The lower part kept moving, while the upper half decided it would be lazy and sit still causing the entire thing to bend into a strange L shape. I exit the highway and pull over at a  urlLink gas station  and unbend it, well, that worked okay for about 3 wipes until it bent again. "Well f*ck it," I say. I continued home with no wiping at all and stop at  urlLink O'Reilly  and picked up new blades. Luckily for me, when I get outside and install the first one, the rain really starts to come down and I get soaked, fun! I decided to wait until later to mess with the passenger side blade since its stupidly wet outside. About 100 ft down the road, the passenger side wiper stops working entirely. &*#! It seems the motor on it gave out, great timing.  Running off on a tangent, before I came into work last night, I sat and watched  urlLink Vanilla Sky . It's a movie that came out in 2001 with Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz in it. I'll quote the plot summary from imdb.org for reference, "A successful publisher finds his life taking a turn for the surreal after a car accident with a jaded lover." Overall I enjoyed it, though it confused me in a few places considering that much of the movie occurred while he was in a dream state. Things don't always make much sense when one is dreaming.  -richard out and remember, Donald Rumsfeld is an evil, evil man

      So I wake up around 7pm from a nice afternoon of sleep, see I work nights right now, and I had the  urlLink worst cramp  ever. It was in my left calf and was causing some of the worst pain I've ever felt. The damn thing tightened up so bad, I couldn't relax my leg at all and had to force my foot up to make the muscles stretch. It was the first time I've dealt with a cramp like that and it felt horrible. Blah.  In other news, the  urlLink Israelis hate Palestinians  and the  urlLink rticle&cid=1080083708744&call_pageid=968332188492&col=968793972154">Palestinians hate Israelis .  In yet other news, I've been pondering the purchase of a different video card for my  urlLink HTPC . At the moment I have it hooked up to my  urlLink 51" Toshiba HDTV  via an svideo cable. The quality on that is rather poor and I haven't figured out how to get the  DVI connection to work with the  urlLink Radeon 9100  I have in it right now. I'm currently thinking of getting a  urlLink Geforce FX 5200  since I know I can get it to work properly with linux (my future plans are to run  urlLink Mythtv ), but it could still have problems with the DVI hookup. For now, I will continue pondering...  - richard out and remember, Donald Rumsfeld is an evil, evil man.

      Much like Norm McDonald's  urlLink theory that all Germans love David Hasselhoff , I believe that all people view news and events the way they want to see them. Let's take George W. Bush (from now on mentioned as  urlLink Dubya ) for example, I see a  urlLink good ole boy  used getting his way by  urlLink manipulation  and intimidation whereas others are seeing that he is a  urlLink strong leader  and a genuine good guy.  Now lets take  urlLink Super Liberal  John Kerry, I think he's a good guy, and many charge that he is a" urlLink waffler " when it comes to his voting record, I see that perhaps in those situations he is changing his view due to a change in the situation. Perhaps the makers of a bill coattails some sludge on it that goes against what he previously liked about the bill. Or perhaps he heard some argument that changed his mind. People on the waterside instead see a guy who cannot make his mind about important issues.  My whole point here is that we see what we want and ignore the rest and get aggravated whenever someone argues against what we perceive as the real truth.  On a completely unrelated topic, I purchased a couple of  urlLink 160GB hard drives  that will hopefully make it easier to not make mistakes with my video editing ventures. I attribute most of those mistakes due to getting a bit rushed sometimes and because I have limited space currently, I will delete the original source before I have validated the completed product. Of course this sucks when I realize that my completed product is flawed and I have to start all over.  - richard out and remember, Donald Rumsfeld is an evil, evil man.

       urlLink Stupid people . Man I hate stupid people. Everywhere you go, there's always more stupid people. You see them on the news, you see them in the coffee shop, you even work with some of them, and possibly even live with one or two of them. Example of a stupid person saying something stupid, "Can I get my phone cut on?" You can't cut a phone on you moron, you turn it on or you hook it up! Another example, "Do I need to be on the internet to get my email?" Yes you f'n idiot, you need to be connected to something to get something from it! I can go forever on that topic, so I'll let it rest. No I won't. You know that ShopNBC channel I hate? Yeah, that one, I f'n hate it. I'm staring at the screen today and what do I see right above some overpriced fake diamond ring? a red banner saying that if you order in the next hour, you get free shipping on all jewelry. Let me preface the next statement by saying that I am forced to stare at that screen for more hours than I'd like to. ShopNBC has had free shipping on jewelry all f'n year! You know what, they wouldn't put it up there if they didn't think it would get some moron to pick up the phone and make a rushed decision to buy it. There, I'm done, go about your business.  -richard out

      The NFL draft, some pretty interesting things happened over the weekend at the draft. In case you were dead or just generally don't care about football, Eli Manning stated bluntly to the San Diego that he would not play for them, holding out for an entire season if necessary. This information never got to the press from his mouth, instead it was told by the San Diego themselves. I'm not sure who's the real goat there. As it turned out, the San Diego did in fact draft Manning, but after the New York Giants drafted Philip Rivers, they traded him and a fair amount of other draft picks to the Chargers for Manning. Everyone pretty much got what they wanted. Another glaringly odd thing that I saw was that Cleveland traded away their first and second round choices to Detroit for their first round choice. Detroit had the 6th overall selection and Cleveland the 7th. So Detroit gets a free second round draft pick and they still get the guy they wanted at the 7 spot. No wonder the Browns are such a hopeless team, they regularly make silly mistakes like this. Looking at my team, Seattle, they did okay by bolstering their defense.  -richard out

      I finished the Legacy of the Drow series yesterday and it ended less than how I would've liked. The fourth book (Passage to Dawn) was easily the weaker of the four, even though the third (Siege of Darkness) was the most intriguing. All in all, I thought the series to be a great read and as such, I ordered the next series  urlLink Paths of Darkness  on Friday. Hopefully I will get that soon so I can fill in my idle time.  -richard out

      I got a little bored yesterday, so I pulled some computer parts out of the closet and assembled another computer. I used an old baby AT case I had, minus its 3.5" drive bays (not sure where they went), a really crappy baby AT Gainward 5VPA Socket 7 motherboard, a K6-3 400, 64MB of PC100, a 60GB Maxtor hard drive and finally an ATI All in Wonder 128. I had to use a Promise Ultra100TX2 to get all 60GB recognized, Gainward never released a BIOS to fix the 32GB problem. That's not really a surprise since you can't find any evidence on their website that such a thing ever existed. So far I have Slackware-current running on it and it seems okay, for only 64MB of RAM, Gnome2 and KDE3 run acceptably well, no doubt because the K6-3 was a really decent CPU.  -richard out

      I've been reading the series  urlLink Legacy of the Drow  over the past week, and it has been a great way to pass my "idle time." I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed the Drizzt Do'Urden books, if you're interested, go pick up the  urlLink Dark Elf Trilogy  from your local bookstore or  urlLink amazon.com . The version of Legacy of the Drow that I got came in the form of all four books of the series in one book, 1100 pages of text, woohoo. I just finished the third of the four, Siege of Darkness, where our valiant heroes whoop up on a Drow Elf army. Maybe I'll pick up the Lord of the Rings series since I've never actually read that.  --richard out

      I got everything transitioned over to the new host at  urlLink linode.com  and everything seems to be running great. The speeds are awesome, latency is wonderful and so far I like being able to have absolute control over everything. In that regard, I did run into a few snags, due to my  urlLink inexperience  in certain things. I was able to get apache working fine, even getting virtual hosts working for both this domain and my friend (who is going in half and half with me for the cost of this thing) for his domain  urlLink truck-web.us . Setting up apache didn't take me very long at all, maybe an hour or so, but it was moving on to the email where I ran into problems.  See, I've never set up a mail server before, I had tinkered only once before on my  urlLink freebsd  computer at home, but quickly decided it was not a great idea due to it being hosted on the cable line. I started by getting  urlLink postfix  running, postfix is a wonderful server as it provides mail delivery and is fairly simple to setup and is also a replacement for the aging  urlLink sendmail . Within a couple hours I was able to get it working fine, testing delivery via a local email program I was using,  urlLink Pine . The next couple of days consisted of me trying to get and IMAP and POP3 server installed so that I could use remote email applications, I started off by trying to get  urlLink cyrus  and various different authentication methods to work with it. Let me tell you, cyrus was a bear, and since I'd never have more than a handful of users, having a  urlLink MySQL  database for authentication seemed silly, so I dumped that idea. I decided to try  urlLink courier , and followed this helpful outline, not really a FAQ in my opinion (as it is titled as being),  urlLink http://arswiki.com/bin/view/Linux/MailServerFAQ . After a few hours of recompiling various packages and installing and reinstall stuff, I was finally able to get courier to authenticate via POP3 and IMAP. YAY! After that, I topped it off with a quick  squirrelmail  install.  -richard out

      Later that day on Friday, I was able to get my car in to get work on. Four hours and $360 later, they were done, and thankfully, it would seem the boatlike feeling is gone. Next up, fixing the rear fender and bumper that got wrecked a couple months ago when I was parked on the street.  I've looked into some hosting options that would free me of the bonds that hosting on my cable provider lock me into. I'd love nothing more than to lose the requirement of having to add :8080 to the end of my domain name. Anyhow, I've been looking into  urlLink linode  for awhile now, mainly for this one reason: I have complete control over the webserver that runs your site. I can install extensions, I can run bunches of virtual domains, etc. The cost I'm looking at is $29.99/mo and I'm going in half and half with a friend of mine, so it should work out fine.  -richard out

      So I took my car in to get looked at yesterday morning. For a few months now, it has been making a weird tapping noise whenever I would drive over any road that was not smooth. Potholes, dips, bumps, the grade increase on your driveway, whatever, it would make lots of weird tapping noises. Two hours later, they call me up and describe what the dealio is, the stabilizer bar was bent and was causing those odd tapping noises when it would move just the right amount of distance. I don't really know if it was causing any other problems, hopefully when I get it fixed early next week (for a mere $360+), I'll notice an improvement in handling. I say this, because it feels more "boatlike" when I drive, and by boatlike, I mean like driving a big-momma chevy from '76. I'm exaggerating a bit, but you get the idea. Oh, I drive a Ford Focus, I bet this whole time you were wondering, "wtf, he's talking about his car and won't even mention what it is." Blah, I'm done for today.  -richard out

      For the past few days, every time I refresh  urlLink news.google.com , more U.S. soldiers are  urlLink getting killed  (and also  urlLink killing those  that are attacking them, terrorists, extremists, pick a definition of them). That sucks. Most of these guys are my age or very close (I'm 25), some with families back home. Argue all you want about the war ever needing to have happened, my personal stance is that the Bush administration lied to us and used Iraq's  urlLink non-compliance with U.N. regulations  to finally get at the guy in Iraq, but we're there now and it is our duty to get that country's economy and government running again. We did this in Japan and now they're one of our closer allies and are all around good guys. It really upsets me that our government and the U.N. haven't  urlLink kissed and made up  yet so that we can get more international help in there. As it stands, all these hate-fueled militants in Iraq will continue to get more and more difficult to control unless we can either squelch their leaders or get that international support. Hey dubya, I know you're busy trying to get reelected, but I guarantee, if you can get Iraq under control and make nice with the U.N. that you'd win (much to my chagrin). Enough bantering, back to doing nothing.  -richard out

      I caved in yesterday and bought a new video card for my HTPC. I did in fact settle on the  urlLink FX 5200  since I know that I can rely on nvidia's linux drivers to work properly. I never considered an  urlLink MX card  because those just suck ballz. I am also fully aware that the 5200 sucks ballz too, but at least not as much as an MX card. I went with a  urlLink 128bit version that eVGA  sells, mostly because of its 128bit memory over the super sucktacular 64bit version and also because of the fanless heatsink. This computer is already a bit too noisy and a teeny little 45mm fan doesn't sound like it'd be much fun in there. The fan issue is another reason why I didn't step up to a 5200 ultra, 5300 or whatever. HTPC + video card fan = bad. In the end, it only cost me $74 and I get a card that at its worst performs as a good dual monitor video card, my radeon 9100 was not good for this.  I hope everyone at least watched a few of the NCAA Basketball Tournament games in the past few weeks, congratulations goes out to UConn for a great run to the championship. Okafor was especially impressive last night, that dude can play.

      Ah.. so my weekend is over. I am in the glorious position right now where I currently have Thursdays and Fridays off, remember I work the  urlLink graveyard shift  so I actually have Wednesday and Thursday night off. As you can imagine, it was yet another weekend full of  urlLink not so much . Nic came over and we had some drinks and watched way too many movies, which was a good change from my recent  urlLink Magic: The Gathering  binge. Being in a room with  urlLink bad smelling, no social skill having, young males  is not always a great way to spend your Thursday or Friday evening. This is not to say that all magic players are pimply faced, four-eyed freaks that have never seen a grown woman naked, but is quite often the norm that I face.  Okay, back to movies since it is most certainly more entertaining than MTG.  urlLink Lost in Translation , I saw it Thursday night and I must say that I was impressed. It's not something that jumps out at you and smacks you in the face with its amazing screenplay. It's much more subtle and uses interesting characters and for us Americans, an interesting and new setting, Japan. I thought the various settings used and all the neato buildings provided stunning visuals that really aided the movie. Oh, I can't forget to mention  urlLink Scarlett Johansson , I definitely dug her role in this movie, she certainly "seemed" older than 18 (now 19 post production of the movie).  - richard out

      So one of my friends on IRC wants to get a slackware-current cd, no sweat I say. You can find plenty of unofficial isos out there if you look hard enough, but there is no fun in that. Besides, who knows how old those isos will be? If you follow slackware at all, you'll know that 9.1 was released a long time ago, nearly 8 months. In terms of software, that is really old, as there have been quite a few changes since, such as Gnome getting updated to 2.6 from 2.4. So I set out to do a quick howto. I'll put this into a separate html file once I finish this post.    Step numero uno: Download slackware-current. To save time, don't bother downloading bootdisks/, extra/, pasture/, source/, testing/, zipslack/ and then within slackware, leave out gnome/, kde/ and kdei/. This will keep our image below 700MB.  Step numero dos: Run the following command mkisofs -o /somedir/slackware-current.iso -R -V "Slackware Install" -v -d -D -N -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -b isolinux.bin -c isolinux.boot -A "Slackware Install CD"  Let's say that you did in fact download /gnome, here's what you do to not include gnome/ in your iso. Somewhere in that long command, add the following (make sure to use the directory of whatever it is you want left out of the iso) -x gnome/  Step numero tres: Assuming I haven't given bad advice, you now have a slackware-current iso that you can burn to cd now. You should be able to boot and then install off of it. I may check into how to create that second cd that would contain the gnome and kde packages, but for now I wouldn't worry about those too much. For your gnome needs on slackware, I highly recommend using  urlLink Dropline . For KDE, use something like  urlLink Swaret .

      Yesterday I hung out with my friend who had just come into town, we went about half an hour south just outside of Plattesmouth, NE to a private land share that his family is renting. The two of us were out on a 3 wheeler and a 4 wheeler for nearly three hours and we had a blast. It had rained a bit the previous few days so there were a fair amount of mud puddles and when we were wrapping things up to go home, the rain came on again and we got drenched. For at least ten hours, my hands were tingling, similar to the feeling you get after mowing your yard and as I type this, my legs and arms are still very sore.

      Crap, eight days since my last post on here. My last week has been again a little boring, mostly just working and sleeping. I got completely through Paths of Darkness about a week ago and quickly finished The Thousand Orcs, the first in the newest Drizzt trilogy, The Hunters Blades. This new trilogy is already shaping up to be very very good, possibly the best, but I'll save that judgement once I've read all three. While I awaited the second book to arrive from Amazon, I picked up Canticle, the first book in Salvatore's Cleric Quinet series and I just finished it. Another very good read, I eagerly await finishing the rest of that series as well.  Also of note, one of my oldest and best friends came into town for the weekend. His youngest sister just graduated from Bellevue West on Saturday, so we hung out for a few hours and saw Van Helsing (a decent and watchable movie). I haven't seen him in nearly two years, and before that had been three or more years. I'll certainly try a bit harder to keep in touch this time.  -richard out

Last night was the first time in nearly two months since I've played, mostly because of my new work schedule, and I had a good time. I might just try to wake up earlier so I can play more with my buds.  -richard out

      So I finished up the second book in Paths of Darkness, and I must say that I really enjoyed it. Salvatore took what I thought to be the least interesting major character from his books and turned it into a wonderful story about a man battling his inner demons. Drizzt is a wonderful character, but if I had one qualm about him, it'd be that he's too perfect. Wulfgar in Spine of the World is anything but perfect, through most of the book, he plays the part of a drunk spending his days looking for another fight. I don't wanna go into great detail since I consider myself a poor critic, but the character development is what really made this book work. Now, I shall continue towards finishing the series.  On a side note, I haven't noticed ShopNBC display that odd banner that shouted free shipping on orders that hour, instead only a large gray blob on the left hand side of the screen that says "FREE SHIPPING 2004." Hmm...  -richard out

      It seems that not too many people are aware of what the  urlLink College World Series  is, even a lot of people who live in the Omaha area. The College World Series is an 8 team double elimination series between the final 8 teams in College Baseball. It is the culmination of the NCAA Tournament which starts with 64 teams much like in NCAA Men's and Women's basketball, but instead of a final four, its a final eight of sorts. It's fairly surprising that most people don't even know that the CWS exists, but it has not had nearly the press coverage that other NCAA sports have gotten, but that's starting to change now with ESPN taking over it's coverage from CBS who just let it squander. Anyhow, Texas won yesterday afternoon putting them in the championship series, a best of 3 series with the winner of South Carolina and Cal St. Fullerton, hook 'em horns!  -richard out

      I just finished the fifth book in the Cleric Quintet series, The Chaos Curse. I really enjoyed the series as a whole, it had interesting characters that were dynamic, they learned and changed and had flaws, just how characters should be. Salvatore is successful because of his characters, sometimes the story is a bit bland, but the great characters can still make the 300+ pages well worth your while. I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys fantasy novels.  Now that I'm done with that series, I picked up The Vampire Lestat, the second book in The Vampire Chronicles. I read Interview With the Vampire a long long time ago, so now is as good a time as any to finish right? Unfortunately I am picking it up after seeing the movie Queen of the Damned (which is a modern conglomeration of both The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned novels) so hopefully that won't spoil it for me.  -richard out

      Sometime on Thursday we found out that the AC in the house had stopped working, I never really noticed since I had slept in a bit and spent some of the early afternoon playing FF XI. Needless to say, by 9pm, it was tremendously obvious that it was broken in some way as there was a decent sized puddle beneath the AC coils. My mom got a repair man out the next morning (thankfully) and the repair wasn't too much, just in excess of $500, so things could've been worse. He also got in there and cleaned up quite a bit of the dirt, dust and cat fur that had collected and now the AC is blowing colder air than I can remember.  In the spirit of spending money, I bought a new monitor last night. Actually I ordered one from dell.com, a  urlLink 2001FP , its a 20.1" LCD that has become quite popular around the 'net. It has a 16ms response time, so it doesn't suffer from ghosting which has been the one thing keeping me from getting an LCD. I'm pretty excited about getting this thing since I haven't bought a new monitor since the summer of 2000. Both of my computers have dual monitor capable video cards, operated using a KVM, so I play on hooking this thing up to both systems and essentially having two dual monitor computers.  -richard out

      Yeah, Ronald Reagan died yesterday. Of course if you watch any sort of 24 hour news channel I'm sure you already knew. They haven't stopped covering it since. I know it's a big deal and all, but I believe this just goes to show how much non-essential news is carried on these channels. This gives them something to fill an entire day of material now, and people will watch it!  I also watched most of the Tampa vs. Calgary game last night, and while I'm not really rooting for either team, I was sorta happy that Tampa won to carry the series to a game 7. This series has been spectacular and full of energy and a game 7 is a fitting way to end it. Make sure to watch it come Monday night.  -richard out

      I just watched Starship Troopers 2. Before I get into the movie at all, I just wanna say that the first one, while not a good movie, was a very enjoyable movie. The thing was done in 1997 and the cgi in it is actually very good imo. It's also a wonderful guy movie, lots of blood, guts, guns, bugs and explosions. It was good times all around.  Starship Troopers 2. It had blood, guts, guns, bugs and explosions. It also had that guy from Not Another Teen Movie that played the football coach, that guy is a genius god damn it. What it didn't have was any sense of fun, it reminded me of a bad horror movie, not a guy movie. Horror movies can be guy movies too, true, but this one was just plain not good. Yes, this movie was a pile. Blah, I'm so disappointed now.  -richard out

      My voice is starting to return slowly, only half of my words are garbled now. I went to the doctor yesterday and confirmed that I do indeed have a sinus infection and possibly an ear infection, so I got some wonderful meds. So far so good, I'm less congested and feel like I'll be as good as new by the weekend. Whoopie!    -richard out

      I don't know what the hell is going on, yesterday I was feeling better, but took one more night off to get some rest, and guess what? When I woke, I was worse than I had been all week. My throat feels like sandpaper was rubbed all over it, my ears are pounding from all the crap that's probably in my ear canals, my sinuses feel like they're gonna burst and I can't talk. I mean I literally can't talk. I mouth the words but only a whisper comes out. Blah I say, blah!    -richard out

      Two days later and I'm still all messed up. My throat is extremely sore and it hurts to talk. The headaches are nearly gone at least and I'm not having problems sleeping now. I already missed the last two nights of work, and it's not looking good for tonight. If that's the case, I should almost definitely be back for tomorrow night.    -richard out

      Figured I'd take a this chance to make a post since it's been a week or so. I went to bed this morning feeling great, maybe a bit tired, but that's it. I woke up about 2-3 hours later and couldn't hardly breathe and I had a horrible headache. I took some generic Day-Quil which helped drain my sinuses, but I still feel like total and utter crap. Usually when I feel like this, it's the onset of a sinus infection. *Sigh*    -richard out

      So I got a haircut today. I literally haven't gotten my hair cut since last September, I think. Maybe I link a picture of the new dew tonight, could be fun times involved. Having your bangs reach your chin kinda sucks, your hair becomes impossible to handle and starts looking like complete crap. I guess I never really cared because I'm not trying to impress anyone at the moment, working on the night shift and all.    -richard out

      My FF XI group finally drug an old RTCW/ET pal of ours into the game, shake! Shake also played some Neverwinter Nights with us back in the day, so he should be a fun addition. While I'm on the topic of FF XI, it's a little eerie at how easy it is to find yourself still sitting in front of the monitor four hours later and you haven't really accomplished much.. this has only happened once or twice, but sometimes that's what happens in games you get caught up in.  -richard out

      I tend to watch Sportscenter whenever I get home from work, during that 40-50 minute period when I'm sitting with my brother waiting for his work van to arrive, and something that has been a main focus lately has been the LA Lakers. With Shaq demanding a trade, Kobe being a jackass and the team looking for a new coach because Kobe didn't like Phil Jackson. I want to center in on Kobe for a second, since he seems to think everything should and does revolve around him. I can't see how anyone would ever want to root for this guy. Lets ignore his off the court actions for a second, on the court, he is a ball hog. He doesn't make his teammates better, if he has an off night his team might very well lose the game. The guy takes more bad shots in one game than an entire high school team combined. Now combine this with how he is controlling the way the Lakers are operating. I'm surprised they were able to hire any coach at all, I wouldn't want to deal with this guy. I hope for Shaq's sake he gets that trade, hopefully to Dallas, I'd love to see Dallas beat up on LA for the next couple of seasons.  On a side note, Farscape is getting a second chance to finish up its story line. If any of you didn't follow that show at all, you may not realize how Sci-fi cancelled the show after the filming of season 4 had wrapped up. Truly a horrible thing to do to a show that had a plot that continued from season to season. So all of us fans were left staring at the screen when the season finale was over wondering wtf we just saw considering it was likely the last Farscape episode we'd ever see again. The word cliffhanger isn't good enough of a description. My friend Dave pointed me to  urlLink this , and I couldn't say how much happier I could be at the moment.  -richard out

      A few days between updates there, my bad. Lately all I've done at home is a bunch of nothing and playing Final Fantasy XI. The only times I can find time to play are after I get off work and have put my brother on the van to work (which is around 9am) and then again when I wake up in the evening around 5 or 6pm. When I haven't been doing that, I've caught up on a few episodes of Star Trek: Voyager from season 1 and catching the random movie here and there. I even formatted and reinstalled Winblows XP on my gaming system. It seems to be running a bit smoother now, so that's a good thing.  On the reading side of things, I finished "The Vampire Lestat" last week and have moved into "The Queen of the Damned" and have gotten just passed the half way point. They aren't real page turners like the fantasy books I was reading last month, but they are still very interesting. The fact that it takes me more than three or four days to finish one lends to its interest as well.  -richard out
