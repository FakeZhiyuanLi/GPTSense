      After a day of flights and connections that  started way too eary this morning, I have arrived at Heathrow airport to wait for my connection to Dublin.  Nothing  is open at Heathrow after like 10 PM but there are lots of guests of Chez Terminal 1 to hang out with (internet came first tho of course).  I forgot to bring any pounds, but nothing is open anyway so I'm not too put out. I'll be back here soon to see more than the airport :-)  These kiosks have all these "frequently used" keys like www. .com .co.uk :-( :-)  The " and @ are in the wrong place tho.  I'm off to figure out the rest of my night. Goodnight my babies.

      The final of three going away parties just culminated in a dirty dirty night at Kingdom with so many friends. I'll spare you the details (Hi Mom), but I rocked out (surprisingly I kept my pants on all night tho) and most of my memories are pops and flashes. Send me pictures of that night.   I'm not so hung over which is nice. I still haven't packed. No, thats a lie. I have done a half-assed job of packing and now I've got to unpack and repack because I am trying to bring way too much that I don't need.   I'm going with two bags and a backpack. Imagine - I can fit enough of my life to live for a year into two little bags.   I still have so much to do. I need to photocopy all my docs. I have to figure out what I'm taking. I still need to shower and get the rest of my hung over friends out of my house.   My flight leaves Toronto at 7:15 so we're leaving Hamilton at 4 AM.  A warning - Don't Do What Donny Don't Does! I thought I knew better and I used Aeroplan points to get a flight. Of course I only booked three weeks ahead. SO I leave Toronto, fly to Washington. From Washington to London. I arrive at Heathrow at 10 PM sunday night and my flight for Dublin leaves at 7 AM. I will be sleeping in the terminal (Adventure). Wish me luck - I hope to get to Killarney with my belongings and money.   I will post again soon - my buddy Adam has given me a bottle of Bushmills and a lot of advice. I'll tell you his stories about the Knackers soon... Watch out for the pikies.   Soon I leave and its blowing my mind. Blog soon.

      Welcome to my wonderful new blog.   I figure since I am away I will save the mass emails and everyone can check up on my any time they want. Now I just have to remember to post.   It is Friday. I leave on Sunday. I am rediculously nervous because this is becoming more real every day. I think I've crossed all the t's and dotted the i's but who knows.   Tonight is the final going away party. Kingdom on a Friday. What a send off.   OK, I've still got things to do and I'm not in the mood to blog (gasp) and this post is going nowhere. I've got to figure out how to pack all my clothes into those two damned bag. How do you pack up your life for a YEAR in two bags? I will know by tomorrow.  By the way, I won't be able to check my email all the time, so I was lucky enough to get a Gmail account. Email me at edwalzak@gmail.com - especially pictures. Yay pictures.

      So Ribena is doing a joint promotion with Shrek 2. Kids can eneter to win...    urlLink  A DONKEY!    Thats right. You can win a real donkey. Apparently that character has done wonders for the status of donkeys everywhere. Kids love them. I have seen children with stuffed Donkey dolls all over the place - they're as inseparable as my sisters and their drag-a-bags.   Despite the problems that can arise with giving a 6 year old a donkey I really admire the ingenuity and creativity of the agency that came up with this. I am researching them now - I will soon know where to start looking when the tourist season is up.   They have products that relate to the targets that are right in my mindscape. I am going to at least tell them how highly I think of them from this one promotion and try to learn more.  [EDIT] Quick sidenote - I just learned that Ribena is owned by Glaxo-Smith Kline. Weird bed-partners, but it makes sense...why couldn't a drug manufacturer make a sift drink? I'm sure making Coca-Cola is closer to a chemical manufacturing plant than, say, a Tropicana processing plant [/EDIT]  Alas, my time on the internet is done. Don't forget the address below - You can even use it to find my house if you accidentally find yourself in Ireland without a place to stay. I have already booked two guests for September. Weeeee. Visitors!  [EDIT 2] I can't stop about this. I've been reading the terms and conditions. It looks like this was done in-house. I've only had a quick glance. This caught my eye tho - basically the kids get an adoption of a donkey from a Donky Sanctuary. They get €1000 to travel and visit the donkey. Its hilarious. So clever. I like this quote:   The purpose of the ROI lottery is to raise funds to support the promoter’s work in preventing the suffering of donkeys and providing a sanctuary for any donkey in need of refuge.    Classic. Such a great humanitarian (donkeytarian?) act. [/EDIT 2]

      And when I say "nothing" I don't mean the kind of nothing that happened in Chretien's reign, but the kind of nothing that comes from a minority government. I'm not really surprised. I'd love to post a big comment on politics, but my time is short and I didn't arrange an absentee vote so I'm a real outsider in this situation for now.   The weekend was insane. I was aching for a tie and a desk and even the most mind-numbing data-entry job.   The problem is that in Ireland the laws about drinking and liability are much more lax. The result is that the bartender here has much less power - and consequently respect.  At home liability of the bar has been proven time and time again. An employee sues the restaurant and her employer for letting her drive drunk and crashing after the Christmas party and gets millions. Litigation has been said to be out of control, with ambulance chasers advertising milions of dollars in settlements from personal injury. Maybe the insurance system is different - I haven't done the research - but the money to be made from being an ass and then saying it wsn't your fault is an astronomical amount.   The result is that bars err on the side of caution - if someone looks like they're causing a problem or is too drunk they are asked to leave and escorted from the bar. The beauty part is that the bartender doesn't have to me nice about it. If you're out you're f'n out. The effect of this is a certain respect for the bartender - even if it is based on fear of reprisal. People partying at the bar have to have a modicum of composure at the bar or a bouncer will gladly show them the street.  In Ireland (and the UK, which I experience through my TV of course - BTW I have to talk about a brilliant promotion that Ribena is doing later on) the laws are more lax. The responsibilty for action is more firmly planted on the individual. Payouts for personal injury lawsuits are lower (personal injury ads here calim to have made money in the 10-30 thousand pound/euro area instead of hundreds of thousands or millions in Canada or the US). I have a feeling there is less tolerance for bullshit in the legal system too. The case of the American man who sued the fast food industry for making him fat was duly thrown out of court, but the fact that it was concieved in the US shows yet another difference in the philosophy.  The result here is a relaxed attitude towards drunkenness. I have served people who are leaning on the bar to stand still and paying with a handfull of change that I have to count from their palms. I have had self-admitted alcoholics barking "ardkah" at me at 3 in the morning because they're too drunk to order a "Vodka."  There is no oder at the bar. It is customary to make eye contact with the person you're talking to and serving. That means nothing to the Irish. They will shout their orders ay the back of your head and shout again when you don't bring it post haste. To rebuke them for not waiting their turn or to tell them to wait only brings more persistent shouting. I ignore but that doesn't stop the orders.   As a Canadian bartender I could just warn one of these people not to act up or they'd be out. And then make them tip me. And then be a snot anyway. Here I am powerless against the onslaught. I have to keep my head down and do my job and think of the good times.   The times like that are much more frequent and priceless. This craziness happens when the crowds come to town in droves - like Summerfest. Everyday is a much better experience. Friendly locals. Funny old guys drinking Guiness. Tourists who give Americans a very good name. Horse racing (I haven't bet yet but I watch and pick a horse in my head).   Its been an experience - if there weren't two sides to it I would be here to learn anything. Sorry this post was mostly a rant, but I fell better to complain a bit.   Its my day off and I splurged to have my laundry done for me at the laundrette. Two loads at €9 each. I had a choice and I chose clean clothes over about 4 drinks.   Cheers.

      I had my day off yesterday. It was nice to relax, but I had about 30 cents so it wasn't exactly exciting. Well, until I decided to get out of the house and head to work for the free coffee.   I was coming down the alley beside Speakeasy and I saw a Roots hoodie and a Canadian flag pin and stopped to meet Laura and Kelly-Ann. They came to O'Meara's for a pint (I had coffee) and we watched the soccer game (Czech republic beat Germany) and Tommy showed up. He's a chef at Salvador's a few doors down.   Tommy's an awesome guy - he had been on the move for 7 years and had only just come back to Ireland. Lives all over the world working in so many different fields.   Anyway, he lined my pockets for the night and we had a few pints at Courtney's and then headed to the Grand for a dance and a few more pints. Saw a whole bunch of people out there, but as soon as I'd find someone I'd lose someone else. Yeah, one of those nights.   I took it easy tho - stayed away from the traditional 1:30 vodka and redbulls and was fine this morning. Fine enough to get out of the house and get some stuff done - emails and a letter for my tax forms. And the BLOG! Yay.  Happy Birthday to my Brother. Jeebus you're 20.  urlLink No longer a teenager.    It is Summerfest this weekend - with SPecial Guests Bryan Adams and Sheryl Crow. I'm working all weekend (seriously, I don't think I'll be sleeping - just working) so I won't see the concert, but there is a contest among the school children. They all painted banners and they're hanging in the pub windows. I am very proud to say that the banner at O'Meara's is really well done AND they have a Canadian flag on it. I am special.   On that note, I have these little flag pins, but I need a statement. Anyone want to send me a flag or a flag patch?  Address for ALL mail. Send me mail.

      It is raining but I have the night off work. I think I will finally catch up on some sleep - probably because I don't have any money right now. This week i get paid for the ful time hours last week so I will be loaded and spend like 2 hours online - then I will do some proper updates.   Miss you.

      Ah the Dingle Peninsula. Just a short bus ride north, beautiful scenery   I will post the rest of this soon - I spent too much time on the last post and writing email. Here's the gist.   I went to Dingle after making plans to visit a friend. The probelm is I mixed my friends up and was making plans with a person in Dublin (damned nationwide cell phone area code). I didn't find out until I was about a half hour from Dingle.   I decided to spent the night anyway. I checking into a hostel with two Canadians I met at the bus station in Tralee (Keryn, Alia). We met some Americans (Bob (Melissa?), Corey, Colleen, Lisa) and had a night out. Great music.   Came back to the Hostel and joined a Paddy Wagon tour group having a bit of a sing along. After ther guitar player went to bed an old Kerryman names Sean sang a song about a brave boy who travelled to Australia, got in trouble with the law and went out with guns blazing. Great song, but the man wasn't a particularly good singer, and was old and haggard, so some americans kept laughing until I shut them up "Shut up and you might learn something" says I. "Giggle Giggle" says she.   I'll rewrite this properly with all the details soon. Sorry its a little sporadic. I'm just tired of neglecting my poor blog.   Cheers.

      I have moved into the Ashburne house. Its still undernconstruction some places, but other than being woken up early by the workmen, its been a great place to live.   I knew that I only had a fitted bed sheet, but got too lazy to do any linen shopping beforte I moved in. Consequently I had to sleep in 2 pairs of jogging pants and 2 hoodies on a bare mattress - it was a double and my sheet is a single.   No problem. The Dunnes Stores are your all in one market - like the big Walmarts that have a grocery store. 72 Euro later I had sheets and a duvet and pillows.   I also had to fill the fridge. The thing about Dunnes stores is that on the way to the grocery store they have an off-licence (liqour store) and they had Stella Artois for 1 euro a bottle. Guess what I chose over food? Thats right. Its nice to have beer in the fridge after the bar, and I have to live it up now before we get the new roomates.   The new roomates. They are a young family - husband, wife, and baby. They have two rooms on the second floor. They know what they're getting into - moving into a house that is full of bartenders (and young ones at that). I hope it doesn't come down to any fighting..."WOULD YOU KEEP THAT BABY QUIET...I'm trying to have a beer."  Just kidding, but I will have to watch my ass.   I have since bought food and have started the task of cooking and cleaning for myself instead of eating at the pub every day...but the amount and quality of food that I can get at the pub for 4 euro makes my simple and quick cooking pale by comparison. I make a mean sandwich tho. Mmm, coleslaw.

      To call from Canada dial 011 353 86 055 5627 then wait..it takes time to connect.  I feel like a wanker posting this over and over again, but I've gotten emails and comments that the number's not working.   Irish people take a glass of ice with their Coors light and MGD. Weirdos. I like the cole slaw on the sandwiches tho.

      Wow - Long weekend and it's been a crazy time. Today's a bank holiday and they say "nothing's open" but the restaurants, shops and pubs are all open, and considering those store make up 90% of the establishments (the others are the bookies, banks and the government office), everything that matters is open.  Work is coming along. I work with great people, at work and at play. After the bar closes we sit in the back room and drink until whenever. Its the after-hours place to be - my boss shows up with a dozen people and its like the bar never closed.   Last night for instance - The bar closed, we cleaned and mopped up, then moved to the back bar with about 10 people. Sean-Michael calls and I meet him at the back door, Pat brings in four more women that had been in the bar. Drinks all around. Then Laura shows up and invites everyone to a party at her new apartment. There's a problem - no drinks. Wait, no problem. Pat slips behind the bar and returns with a case of Red Bull and a 3 litre bottle of vodka. Ta-daa...instant party. We were seen by the Guarda on the way out but they just looked the other way (it pays to know people I guess).  I had a moment the other day. An old Kerryman asked where I was from. I told him and told me he was surprised because I pull a nice pint of Guiness. I was honoured.   The old boys are a tough read tho. They're friendly enough and will try to speak clarly for me, but when they start drinking they slur and get mad at me becaue I can't understand.   There's a super nice old guy Sham (I dunno how it is spelled) who always repeats himself three times and all that comes out is a garbled string of noises. I've learned it means "pint of Guiness" and I avoid any other conversation to keep my sanity. There's nothing worse than a painfully long drawn-out conversation of Irish gibberish I don't understand.  The bottom line is I'm settling into work. My future housemates are awesome. Betty's German, Mike's Polish. We're gonna have good times.   I've been running. I need to - everytime you meet someone they ask to go for a pint. I made a friend who's here from Quebec City who likes coffee, so thats a bonus. The pub is still the centre of life. I've been drinking there, eating there, working there, reading the paper there. Everything. I'd sleep there if there was a cot in the back.   I need some food - the past few days my schedule allows for one or two meals a day - nothing is open when I get off work and I don't get hungry till about work time anyway, so I just go early and eat there (staff discount!).   I'm off. I'll be back - I'm sure I forgot something. Lots of love.

      First day of work. Great time. Worked with Liam, who is your typical sarcastic Irish barman. I was told he'll be nice until he knows me better.   I started at 7, pulled a few pints to show Liam what I could do. The funny thing is that the only taps that gave me trouble were the Bud and the Hienekin - new kegs meant I got glasses of foam. Now I know how to fix that.   The language barrier is the biggest problem tho. The foreign tourists are fine - they try really hard to be understood. I had a hell of a time with this guy Dan from the band tho - he speaks low (like every Irishman) and has a thick thick accent. I had to get him to repeat himself three times when he'd come to the bar. We laughed about it when we met later, but I gotta get this accent down.   For a place where you make no tips, I was fortunate enough to have some good yanks from California at the bar early on. 7 Eruo for the night in tips. Dismal from Canadian standards - good for a Thursday at O'Meara's. By the way, anyone who visits me has to tip me. I will feel homesick if you dont. haha  The band was awesome. For at least three songs the entire bar went silent to listen to them sing. It had a guy on guitar, a girl who sang and played a flute of some sort, and a guy on the accordian (Dan from above). This is my little seqway into...  The band girl was good looking. The german girl in the bar with her mother was so hot (and looked like Jessica Simpson - I would have gotten a picture but I was working). The girl with dreads was so hot. The girl on her boyfriends knee was so hot (boo boyfriend). And they were only ones to write home about (literally). There were other attractive locals and tourists in the bar. I am very happy with my location right now.   I have to go make some dinner and watch game 5 of the Stanley cup finals (I know its a day late - don't tell me the score.) Then its off to the pub and probably McSorley's and home to watch the boobies on television (I will post about TV soon - Its hilarious but brutal but the women are topless).  Today I went running in Killarney National Park. I need to start offsetting the pints and curry fries (I tried them, pretty decent. Mmmm curry sauce). It was run number one. If I can get in one more before Sunday then I will keep it up. Yay running.   Cheers

      First thing to remember - when someone serving you says "Are you OK" give them your order, don't tell them how you are. Its universal, and I've fallen for it at least a half dozen times.   "Are you OK" "Yeah, I'm fine, can i have a ham sandwich?"  "Y'alright mate?" "Not bad not bad...Do you have these in a 12?"  I've been here a few days and I have yet to get up before noon. But the sun stays up until 11 PM so I still have a lot of time to enjoy my day. Thats right - 11PM...I should have moved here years ago.  I made it out with Sean Michael to the Grand the other day - Looks like it'll be a great club...It was a Tuesday night and it was packed. Good thing - my days off will probably been Monday-Tuesday. Party down.   SM pointed out the girls I should stay away from - the knackers. They're the tarty-looking ones, lots of spandex and hoop earrings and probably a baby carriage in the group. Good advice.   There is a ton of golfing around here - Sean-Michael and I made it out for a round at the Gap of Dunloe. Not the greatest course but the price was right and the view of the gap and the Kery mountains was awresome. Plus there was a sheep farm in the adjacent field and the sheep serenaded us for most of the round. I played poorly, but it was the first round and I had rented clubs - excuses excuises I know, but the putter was like a rock tied to a stick.  I did a little shopping - Picked up some running shoes. I figure if I'm not working til the afternoon I should be able to fit in a few runs a week. I just have to find roads that aren't SO narrow that I get hit.   Yah, the roads are narrow. They're also hemmed in by walls of foliage, so when cars pass each other they alsmot hit the trees. I'm glad I'm not driving.   I got one email from a swapper in Dingle - unfortunately I missed her, but its close so I'll be heading up the coast soon. Lots of time to do everything. As long as I start doing things and stop telling myself I have lots of time, I'll have lots of time.   So what else? I love coleslaw on sandwiches, and they all do it. Sean Micheal even has it in his fridge for homemade coleslaw sandwiches. Mayonnaise is another layer to a sandwich - I have to remember to ask for a little mayo because they really slather it on. I literally had a ham and mayonnaise sandwich. Gross. I would have preferred coleslaw.  OK, I admit, this week has been slow - I'll be sure to get into some trouble to make this more interesting...or I'll just start making it up.   Don't forget to call.

      I've made it to Killarney...spent the night then slept in till 2 today...I'll have to start walking up earlier now.  My night at Heathrow ended with a mad rush between terminals to find my bags. I checked in with my flight at about 5:15 AM and found ut that my bags weren't forwarded to Dublin and that they were probably still sitting in the baggage claim. With an hour and a half to go I jumped the shuttle to Therminal 3 and lo and behold - there were my bags sitting in the midle of the floor in the claim area. Pick them up and start making my way out - hit a line at immigration (damn - no time for this) and start the wak back to Terminal 1. Its no short trip. I was motoring and it took about 15 minutes.   I walk into T1 (starting to sweat - one hour to go) and see a HUGE line at the check in kiosks. Damn. Find someone from BMI and show my ticket and he tells me I can go to the bag drop and skip the line. At the bag drop, being the contientious traveller I am, I tell them my bags spent the night alone. Instead of dropping them there I have to walk to Check-in point Y. Ten minutes later I find it, drop my bags, and start motoringthrough the checkpoints.   With about 5 minutes to spare I arrive at my gate, drenched with sweat, and take a quick minute to change my shirt and put on some deodorant (No shower and I feel grimy...and probably stink) and head to my seat.   I love the BMI woman - she gave me a window seat just shy of first class, but still with the wide seats.   On my first trip across the Irish sea, bursting with anticipation and dying to see the scenery, the lack of sleep catches up with me and I nap from take-off to the moment the landing gear came down. It is no great loss becuase I'll make the trip again, but I was a little pissed at sleep at the moment.  The arrival to Dublin was smooth - no troubles at immigraton. Took a bus downtown to the USIT office and someone was kind enough to watch my bags in their office. Now I've five hours to kill before my orientation and I have a map. Jameson and Guiness are west, so i start walking and to see what I can see.  The old Jameson Distillery was closer, so in I go to see the tour. In the half hour wait I met a kid from California named Patrick who's visiting his friends, so we have a hot whiskey and wait.   The tour was pretty cheesy. Kind of needs a re-vap to take it out of the '70s, but it was cool to see. I was chosen out of the crowd to do a whiskey tasting, so for my 7 euro I got 7 free shots of whiskey - Jameson's,Bushmills,Paddy's, some other Irish whiskey, a Johnny Walker and a Jim Beam. We taste, then drink, then we get another for our troubles. Needless to say I was starting to feel it with no food and no sleep.   I left the distillery behind me, the proud new owner of an "Official Whiskey Taster" certificate, and head back to the office. I have some time to kill so I stop for a pint or two.   Three O'clock rolls around and its time for orientation. Now being tired and drunk I dozed through most of it, but I met some awesome people. A girl from Texas who actually has a gun under the seat of her SUV, a cutie from Minnesota, etc etc. Numbers were exchanged. If you read this, get in touch.  The train was alright. I was tired so I missed the countryside again, but lickily I didn't miss my stop. I came into Killarney and couldn't get ahold of Sean Micheal so I decide to try for a hostel. I stopped at one and it was full "Do you knwo what this place is? You have to book months in advance" so the cabbie and I decide to frin SM's place.   Lo and behold it was right where he said it was. After a beer and a greeting I went down to O'Meara's to meet Pat and talk about the house and work.   My room was under construction and somehow had a little fire so it won't be ready till next week, but work starts on Friday! I met some barflies who started introdusing me as "the new barman." I have a feeling I'll see them a lot.   So today I walked the town to get my bearings. I got a mobile and a camera and I'm off to see the apartment (where I'll be living with some other O'Meara's employees, a german girl and an irish guy).   Email me pictures at edwalzak@gmail.com. I still use my hotmail for MSN but it fills up so fast.   I forget my mobile number so I'll post it this week. Call me if you're around and I will take you out!  Goodbye my babies.

      I have bought a  urlLink hurley ! Its great! I am learning to play...actually myself and a few aussies are teaching ourselves, but its great craic and it doesn't involve hanging out in the pub.   Hurling is the fastest field sport in the world. It reminds me of hockey only less padding and no skates and a bunch of other stuff, but the speed and the way the plays decend into organized chaos with a thread of brilliance behind them is reminiscent of our favourite ice sport.   I don't know how to explain it. Here's a urlLink  great site . Read through the topics on the left.   Basically these guys take modified field hockey sticks and bat this ball around. They can hit it through the uprights (like a field goal) and its worth one point or they can score a goal (like soccer, they have a keeper and everything) and its worth three points. Its amazing to see a ball flying into a group of players all swinging their clubs around their heads. Somehow you will have to see this. I'll teach you when I come home - I'll have a few hurleys and balls and we'll do it up. Hopefully I'll come home with all my teeth!  Talk soon my pretties!  Jordan is coming to visit me in September. The dates are the 11th to the 17th. SO that slot is taken because he was first. Everyone else can register their desired visit times with me at my gmail account and we'll work it out!

      No worry, I'm back. I wasn't lost in action - still plugging away in Killarney. The thing is now that I'v joined the gym i'm more likely to head in there than to the internet cafe. Its working, I've lost a few kilos in the last few weeks. Not too shabby.   There has been a whole lot happening. I don't know if I talked about the Shin Fein fundraiser, but basicaly its a political party that has close ties with the IRA and basically was the IRA in what is now the republic. Lots of the Irish from Ulster were down and the band was incredible - so many stories of valour and heart. It doesn't really paint a picture like the one from the day of the Orangemen parade when the police were attacked with everything from rocks to hammers.   We in Canada use the term "like" all the time. Like, its always at the beginning of our sentences. Here, its at the end of a stentence like. AT home its more about a tool for stalling and thinking, like um or ah... here its tacked on the way some people might say "right?". The problem with this difference is that I'll find myself using it at the beginning and end of sentences. Ahh well I'll work it out someday like. haha  I've had my first visitors from Canada. It was alright but wasn't exactly stellar. They were nice enough but we didn't get on really well, which is obviously what&nbsp;I was hoping. Its nice to be thrown together with someone and its like you're old friends. Instead I played host which was also fun, shopping and partying and walking in the park. I'm going to try again next weekend - a french canadian girl is coming from Dublin and its a bank holiday Monday so we will have a great weekend.   Speaking of which, the long weekends don't start early here. They are extended and Sunday becomes the biggest party night of the weekend. When there is a bank holiday we get hammered at the bar - I'm hoping I can get it off - its hard to get time off on the weekend. We'll figure it out.   I'm off to hit the gym before I go to work. Top everyone I haven't emailed in a while, i apologise. I will get on it soon. And so many thanks to everyone who has called me. I miss you everyone and its already been two months like, so I'll be home before you know it.   &nbsp;

      This weekend in Killarney, Cork will face off against Tiperary in a big hurling match....  This match will be attended by 40,000 crazy hurling fans from the two counties. We are in trouble. There will be a lot of people, a lot of rough people. I'm going to need a lot of coffee.   Sunday will be the Kerry football match aganist someone somewhere thats not here. Maybe Tralee? It is going to be a good weekend for sport, just super busy for me.   There is a big concert near dublin this weeekend. The  urlLink Oxegen  festival, which was supposed to have Bowie headline the Sunday show. I didn't get tickets and when I was feeling Blue about missing my man, someone told me he's ill and has pulled out. Now I'm happy I saved about €70. Phew.   I am sore sore sore. I joined Physique fitness centres. I have a pretty hardcore workout schedule. I have two programs - one for slimming down and one for bulking up. That means to do each three times a week has me going almost every day. Well at least I'll be getting a lot for my money. I'll be primed for cheerleading on an open team when I get home.  The club is run by this older gent Angus. Hilarious guy - he's always there and encouraging everyone and pushing them. Its a small gym - nothing like home - but its very cozy, the people are nice, my housemate works out there, and it is close to my house. When you make it out here you'll hardly recognize me - I'll be looking like I did when I was at the peak of my cheerleading fitness level.   I am fitting into this pair of black cords that I bought a size too small when I was still in Canada - they are incredible and they were only $20 so I had to buy them. Now they fit and I am happy. Woot woot.  I have to go - My clothes are on the line and the beautiful sunshine of the morning had turned to rain. I need to buy a shirt for work and a rack so I can dry my clothes indoors.   I have a bit of bad news. Erin - my dear Erin go Braghless - will no longer be coming to visit. She has made plans to go to Scotland and she hasn't been able to work the schedule around coming to Killarney. So sad - she'll will be missed. I was looking forward to seeing the sights and partying at the Grand with her.   Erin was the one who originally seeded my mind with thoughts of Ireland. Her brother was here, she loved the place. When I saw I had a chance I thought of all the great things I'd been told and ploughed ahead with it. Thanks for the inspiration. I'm sorry we can't see the country together afterall.

      Well Happy Canada Day everyone!   I wore my Canadian flag pin and told everyone that it was Canada Day and wished them all the best...  I made the mistake of saying "H.C.D" to a girl from Quebec and she got all offended. She said "I know we have differing opinions, but I expect you respect mine." See, on Jean Baptiste day she was wearing a sepratist pin and although we had a quick debate, I ended it with wishing her a great St. Jean Baptiste day. But she's the oppressed minority, so she can be snide when I am proud of soemthing. Anyway...  I had a great night. I was going to go home to bed but a few girls from  urlLink Sligo  stopped by and invited me out. Who am I to say no to two beautiful girls who travelled 6 hours just to be in Killarney?   Everyone from work was out. My boss bought me a few drinks. We partied and danced. I met a girl from Estonia who is here to work for the summer. It's funny - I meet so many forign people - I'd say i know as many immigrants (like myself) as I do Irish people. Killarney is a great town.  I joined the gym. I figure since I've been losing weight just by changing my eating habits and I sit around a whole lot, waiting for the night time, I can get out to the gym. I dropped a one time fee and I have my membership for 3 months (no renewals). I'll be happy to do more than just pushups and situps in my room. I'm going to find the biggest guy in there and challenge him to a duel. Then make him my workout partner. Then I will be huge.   Cheers
