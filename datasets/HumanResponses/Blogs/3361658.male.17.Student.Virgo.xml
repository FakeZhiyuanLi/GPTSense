      Well I just got back from The Manor, in West Orange.  Nice place, great food.  I ate way too much.  It was a buffet so I kinda felt like John Belushi in Animal House.  My feeling after eating all that food is like his reaction after drinking too much beer...  urlLink     Posted by  urlLink Hello

      It is with heavy heart that I must pass on the following news.  Please join me in remembering a great icon of the entertainment community.   The Pillsbury Doughboy died yesterday of a yeast infection and complications from repeated pokes in the belly.  He was 71.   Doughboy was buried in a lightly greased coffin. Dozens of celebrities turned out to pay their respects, including Mrs. Butterworth, Hungry Jack, the California Raisins, Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies and Captain Crunch.  The grave site was piled high with flours.   Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy and lovingly described Doughboy as a man who never knew how much he was kneaded.   Doughboy rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with turnovers.  He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes.  Despite being a little flaky at times, he still, as a crustly old man, was considered a roll model for millions.   Doughboy is survived by his wife, Play Dough, two children, John Dough and Jane Dough; plus they had one in the oven.  He is also survived by his elderly father, Pop Tart.   The funeral was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes.

      "Why do I Run?"       "This is a very complex question.  And if I was totally honest I would tell you that I really have no idea why I run.  In fact I think it is not a sport and aside from the health benefits is a waste of time!  I don't really like it too much.. I don't have fun doing it.  So why do it?  Hmm.. I think I do it because it is a challenge.  Also the fact that every race is different and anyone can have a good day and win a race.  Oh and running is painful and stupid and only for people who are truly messed up in the head.  Running is for all the people who are too scared to get high off of weed so they do it by running.  It works out pretty well health wise.  The only real reason I run is because the people that run with me are very nice people, and they don't really care if I suck because that's not what its about.  Ok well that's about all I have to say for now."      This is all courtesy of my good friend Andy G (and I feel the same way about running).  If you would like any of your writing to be posted up here then just send it to me and it will be up in a day.  If you have a blog yourself, feel free to send me the URL and I'll promote that as well.  Anything you want, you got it...

      Hey check it out!!!  It's Coach Jackson... What an assclown.  (Actually, for all you non Animal House fans; that is Niedermayer, an anal ROTC leader.  I do believe that is how Coach Jackson acted during college, I mean just look at him today.)  urlLink      Posted by  urlLink Hello

      There are a ton of stupid people in the world...  I mean I see it at school all the time, but the stuff that makes the news is just hilarious.  People that perform such stupid acts make me realize that I'm better off in this world than I think I am, and that is a great feeling to have.  So just today there have been a number of stupid things going on.  Here is the list...      1.)A man was arrested for driving his lawn mower drunk down the street.  He is now being held on $50,000 bail.   2.)A company gets broken into five times. This company hires a security company who installed a video surveillance system. The security guards forgot about video surveillance system, and decided to break in. Needless to say, they were thrown in jail.   3.)People are saying that Vampires are apparently roaming the streets of Portland.   4.)Don't make the same mistake that these dumbasses made... When selling exotic animals illegally, do not hang a sign on the front of your store that says "live exotic animals".   5.)A man spent $28,000 at a strip club, and he still did not get laid.  That is just plain sad.   6.)A Building contracter hired three firefighters to burn down a $1.5 million house after the owner refuses to pay in full. Hilarity ensues...   7.)And a man was fined $312 for "driving" a donkey drunk.  That is just today...

      Well I feel like actually writing something today.  There have been some pretty funny things that I have encountered in the past couple of days.  Monday started off with a bang! My English teacher is borderline retarded, and she managed to impress me with her retardism...  See, you would think that with less than a month left of school that a teacher would know the names of their students.  Not Ms. Grande.  This isn't anything new, but it just never ceases to surprise me when she does this.  At this point you are wondering what exactly did she do.  Well she was in the middle of handing out parts for this play that we are reading so she is reading off names when she gives a name of a student that does not exist.  Now not only did we lack a student with this name in our class, I am almost positive that in her other junior class the student does not exist.  So when nobody said anything she yelled at the girl with the name that sounded closest to the name that she actually said.  Yesterday and today have been pretty uneventful, but one thing that is a continuing trend is the absence of my biology teacher.  I think that this is the 3rd week of school that she has been absent for my class, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  Of course our new room is a big closet (no windows).  Now that will drive you insane real quick.  I don't know what I'm going to do in that class, because not only does it lack windows but it also lacks cell service.  Now I really doubt that I will ever do an ounce of work in that class even with no windows or cell service.  I think that I'll just give the teacher a blank stare when she gets back.  Oh and that final is going to be a failure.  Not just for me though, the entire class.  So with a curve that could give us all an A.  Not a bad deal, hell I'd take it.  Well this is pretty long.  I kinda like this blog thing.

      So I have this thing, but what the hell am I suppose to do with it... If I were you I would expect to hear about my hilarious existance on this earth. No, i will not tell you my deepest, darkest secrets. However what I can tell you about are the funny things that I come across in my day. For instance; Keith Marvel getting hit in the head with a lacrosse ball and falling to the ground, he then proceeded to 'curse up a storm'. Now that happened a while ago, but it is by far the funniest thing that I have ever witnessed. So expect to hear about more things just like that.

      Now there are many different kinds of people in this world.  Funny people, mean people, happy people, sad people, smart people, dumb people.  Then there is the group of people that feels overlooked by society, *cough* emo people *cough*.  But the truth is that they aren't overlooked.  Some people, like me, notice them.  We notice them for what they are... a bunch of crybabies that cannot stand their existance in the suburbs.  You may ask yourself, "What the hell do they have to complain about?"  umm... well not much really, but they find things to complain about.  So in short emo people piss me off (Listening to emo music does not make you emo).  Stop complaining, you have a lot to be thankful for.  Just remember that great Rolling Stones song... "You can't always get what you want.  But if you try sometimes well you just might find... You get what you need."  Try to have fun in life too.  Just like Drunk Girl here...  urlLink     Posted by  urlLink Hello

      Well today I just got all the stuff that I need.  Construction of the site will begin tomorrow, and hopefully it will turn out as good as I hope it to be.  The site will be located at mopes.port5.com, and probably won't be up for a while now.  Just give it a few weeks.  Once finals are over with though, I will be pumping stuff out of there like there is no tomorrow.  Anyway, if you have any comments, or suggestions for the website just leave them here.  Don't worry I'll get to them.

      Yea I was just kidding about deleting this blog.  It is loads of fun...  But anyways, I still need ideas for my webpage.  I've been thinking of a site dedicated to rehabilitating emo people like me.  That would be nothing short of, interesting.  Maybe, I should be normal and just make a cool homepage.  After all, that digital camera will be coming soon enough.  So if you want to voice your opinions, please do so.  Any idea is a good idea, well to me anyways. Yea, now that whole thing about the six year old kid was just a goof, I gave being emo a shot.  Shi!  And wouldn't you know it... I'm pretty damn good at it.  But today I reached an all time low.  Actually at this very moment I'm reaching lower and lower...  So you may be wondering what exactly it is that I did.  Well I'll tell you what I did, or am doing.  Hmm... that sounds weird.  Anyways, I am trying to hold a convo with this SmarterChild.  Very interesting to say the least.  Now I just clicked on the 17 and over so that this thing could curse me off, but it just does a bunch of weird things.  Anyways, I suggest that you give it a shot.  It is surprisingly fun.

           Today I came upon this very interesting revelation, and that is that my life is damn near pointless.  It's funny how it all came about too.  I was at work just doing the whole cashiering thing, and on the register next to me is this mother and and this little kid.  The kid goes to the cashier next to me, "I'm going on a date tonight!".  Then the cashier asks how old this kid is, and he responds with "I'm six".       So I told you that story to tell you this one...  I am seventeen years old, and have never had a date, let alone a girlfriend, and standing right next to me was this six year old kid that apparently has had both.  I have been living this life for eleven more years than this kid and he has had more luck than I have had.  Maybe it's because I'm shy or just a complete loser...  Either way, I just found myself to be pathetic for those few moments.  So that was the crappy part of the day.  Well that was the only thing interesting that happened.  So as Lloyd says to Harry in Dumb and Dumber, "Man, You are one pathetic loser".  I will direct that same comment to myself.

      "They're not traditional punks; they're not frustrated indie kids or disillusioned college English majors. They're not wearing glasses to be cool and they're not wearing vintage T-shirts to impress. So then, who are the emo kids today?  They are the kids from the suburbs, from outside the major cities, and from way, way off the beaten path; kids from the traditional punk breeding grounds like Long Island and New Jersey, places where rampant commercialism and boredom constantly combine to push inhabitants into a desperate search for something "real."..... "They haven't really thought the deep thoughts yet they're too caught up in the majesty of their own private drama and the've found a music that privileges that very same drama- that forces no difficult questions, just bemoans the lack of answers."  CAME ACROSS THIS IN SOMEONE'S LIVE JOURNAL.  THOUGHT EVERYONE WOULD LIKE IT...

      Well, good news and maybe some people will call this bad news...  My old website will be returning, and will be better than any of you could ever believe.  That is because I've got some really smart people helping me.  And the maybe kinda bad news is that this blog is probably gonna die, oh well.  However to replace it I plan on adding a message board to my website.  It should be great.

           Well Live Journal is busted for the moment... actually for the past couple of days, so I will make a post on here.  I kinda forgot how much I liked blogger.  This is pretty cool stuff.      I cant count for shit... well I can I just cant count the right way.  But even better than that is I waited to punch in cuz I thought I was suppose to be working 1:15 to 10:15... it turns out I was suppose to be working from 1:00 to 10:15.  So I punched in at 1:08 cuz I thought it would be early but I wasnt, i was actually late (by one minute).  Oh well.  That  was my fun-filled day.  (Well yesterday's fun-filled day).
