       Lately everyday seems exactly the same.&nbsp; Kind of like how the guy in the movie Office Space feels.&nbsp; He will go to work and do the same things everyday, then head home and have the same routine.&nbsp; My day's are a little different by the fact there is always some kind of drama going on and then&nbsp;I will be expected to fix it.&nbsp; I will gripe about it from time to time, but if I sit down and think about how I would act if I didn't have anything going on, I would be bored out of my mind.&nbsp; I honestly wish I could have a more relaxed life so that I would be a little more peaceful, but then I believe I would get bored and then cause something to mess up.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; I never believed this until a couple of weeks ago, I got home from work, sat down on my couch , and began to think&nbsp;about how&nbsp;I had nothing to worry about at the moment and that this evening was going to be so relaxed, and an early one too!&nbsp; As I sit there watching my favorite t.v. show CSI Miami (of which I haven't sat down and watched in a couple of months.), well I realize that my phone hasn't rang in a couple of hours.&nbsp; I then&nbsp;check to see if maybe it was turned off, but it was still working.&nbsp; As another hour passes by I start to pace around my apartment upset at nothing.&nbsp; My friend Ryan calls and starts to talk to me and I get a little of an attitude for no reason what so ever and eventually end up hanging up on him.......At first I was&nbsp;angry w/him and going around bad mouthing him until&nbsp; my friend&nbsp;Micah asks me why.&nbsp; I&nbsp;sat there for a second and then eventually came to terms with the fact I had no reason to be upset with him.&nbsp; I then&nbsp;tried to sit back and list all of the people I've&nbsp;been having my little problems with in my head and ask&nbsp;myself why.&nbsp; I realized after evaluating a few of my situations, that it's been me all along for the most part!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do I do this??&nbsp; I seem to cause a ton of commotion in my life then stress my self out, for no apparent reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be&nbsp;working on this&nbsp;from here on out.&nbsp; I also noticed that when a friend or family member&nbsp;gives me a call and is&nbsp;upset or in some kind of trouble, I tend to make it my problem&nbsp;until everything is&nbsp;ok and they are feeling better.&nbsp; I don't know, I almost feel like I thrive on&nbsp;drama......&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I didn't have a stressful day at all today and my goal is to keep it this way.&nbsp; No problems, no anxiety, no sadness, no worries!&nbsp; :-) or :-(&nbsp;But the question I ask myself is,&nbsp; Am I satisfied or am I feeling&nbsp;as if &nbsp;something is missing?        &nbsp;

       I've decided that I really need to try and finish all the projects I start, before attempting to start another.&nbsp; Today was another Monday, but I have been doing a lot of thinking.&nbsp; I was having a fun weekend until yesterday morning when I was completely freaked out by a friend of mine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am almost feeling like he is making himself my project, rather than a friend.&nbsp; What I can't stand is that I really don't know if he's a friend or more or less.&nbsp; He's very talented and caring, but only when he wants to be.&nbsp; Very self absorbed.&nbsp; Now, he's asked me to&nbsp;be here for him and help him out with certain weaknesses of his own.&nbsp; I don't see how someone can sit there and spill their guts out to another person then turn around and go against everything they had just said.&nbsp; I am almost to the point in my life where I just can not be here anymore for my friend....It's starting to interfere with my life, plus if I need someone to talk to he is very rarely available for me.&nbsp; I have my own problems and goals to think about, not someone else's!!&nbsp; Especially when I'm feel as though I am being taken advantage of.&nbsp; I can be here as a friend and someone to talk to, but I don't think I will be running to be there for him if he can not be a strong enough person to go with his word.&nbsp; Everyone knows what's right and what's wrong.&nbsp; All you have to do is have the strength to do what's actually in your heart.&nbsp; I think he honestly is afraid of the outcome, but I say suck it up and do it!!&nbsp; No talk, just go for it.&nbsp; Don't tell me show me.........     &nbsp;   I'm supposed to go see my 2 little cousins today, but I am having to reschedule.&nbsp; I feel guilty about doing this, but after the stressful weekend I was put through, I am feeling&nbsp;a bit tired and weak.&nbsp; I need to rest tonight, then go tomorrow when I get off work.&nbsp; I am always doing something I feel like.&nbsp; I need some "me" time, yet I don't ever get it.&nbsp; When I go home tonight, I have to go pick up my desk, bring it home, set everything up that goes w/my computer, cook dinner, then get ready for bed.&nbsp; It's crazy, I call that resting, or my &nbsp;"me" time......
