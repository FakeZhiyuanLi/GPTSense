      This will be the Getting to know me post. My name is Paula and I am a 27 year old Ultrasound student in Miami, Florida I am married to the most wonderful husband in the world. Jimmy is 33 and is a machinest. We have been married 2 years and 4 months. We started trying to conceive on January 1, 2002 what better way to start the year. I stopped birth control way before that December of 2001 we had been living together for about 3 years and really knew that we were meant to be together so if got pregnant it would be great. Well a year later I started to get worried because everyone around me was getting pregnant and me nothing not even a scare my cycles started to get all wacky at one point I bled for 23 days. OB/GYN said it was because of irregularity So I said OK and I made an Appt with a Reproductive Endocrinologist. We ran a bunch of tests and found out that I don't ovulate every month and Jimmy has a Low Sperm count. Doc wasn't too worried about the sperm count as he put it you only need one so they put me on clomid the 50mg cycle did nothing, the 100mg cycle did nothing either, and finally 150 mg and guess what you guessed it NADA! So he decided injectables was the best way to go but I couldn't afford it. So he suggested I try to lose weight that because of my weight it could help regulate my cycles so I did that my cycles did go back to 28 day cycles and I was happy so I decided to go on WeightWathers in April of 2003 and it was working great I was happy and losing weight nothing could be better. Then I lost my job and my insurance and couldn't afford to see the RE anymore I stayed home depressed and hoping now that I could get pregnant cause you Only need one Spermie to get Pregnant right well it didn't happen and June of 2003 I fell down the stairs and tore a tendon in my right ankle. So I couldn't drive and I couldn't exercise. SO I gained everything I had lost on WeightWatchers Back. I got all sad again and my cycle went nutty again. In september 2003 I found the best Job ever!! I was working for an OB/GYN who specializes in infertility and he was so nice I really started loving this job I had never been so happy at work and I was surprised because I had all these pregnant women coming in and then the postpartum ladies with there newborns it was really great!! I started to feel really good about my self and my job and relized that I was not the only infertile women in the world believe it or not that is how I felt. Now I see tons of women who have been trying alot longer than me get pregnant. I used to get sad when I would here that another women got pregnant but not anymore now everytime one of our patients get pregnant I get as happy as if it were me. Right Now I am seeing an OB/GYN who is a partner with the doctor I work for and I just recently started charting again after a 4 month break. I am curently on CYCLE 1 (after the break) CYCLE DAY 11 0 Days past Ovulation. At the end of the year if nothing happens I will go to see an infertility Doctor. Hopefully I wont have to.
