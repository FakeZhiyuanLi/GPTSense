      ...and told me I'd never be prettier than the man on the penny.  Just kidding! Hopefully my idea will work out.  (my idea--->) The group of us buddies from The Village can use this blog for keeping-in-touch purposes. Everyone can have their own username on this blog (I, as the executor, go me) and write their own postings for everyone to read. It could work out and be super cool. Good idea??  If you're interested, let me know and I can send you a 'member invitation' thingy so you can write postings.  Otherwise, you can just read and enjoy and leave anonymous, threatening comments (woo, feel the power).

      So it's that day. That Friday the thirteenth day.  No bodily harm has been done to me thus far, and thankfully, by comparison, not much emotional scarring has occured.  And so it is now that I realize just how much work I have yet to do before school starts.  UGH kill it. Or me. Which ever is easier.  The laundry situation is under control, thanks to moi. Nonetheless, the lady of the house beckons me still to do her bidding.  I must depart whenceforth I came.

      It's a rare thing that I get so much sleep as to confuse reality with dreams, but it happened last night/today. This time the sandman left me with: A close friend of mine had been shot in the lip and I went to visit him at the hospital. I woke up really late and the first thing I thought of was to check the condition of this friend who had been shot. So when I told my mom I wanted to go back to the hospital this morning, she was obviously confused, and that in turn spawned an hour's worth of confusion and deliberation. (just for the record, my buddy's safe and sound *winks*)  I went running today, but not in the morning like I usually do. So it was extra tiring and extra unnerving since more people were alive at that hour. And I must have missed the memo that said runners=okay to stare at obnoxiously no matter how many death threats are put into your mailbox... or, rather... *ehm*  I also fiddled around on the piano today trying to teach myself some hymns for this old lady's funeral... not a very religious old broad, so as you can imagine, very tricky to choose death-y music for her funeral. She didn't have any family, and her friends are all dead...so I suppose it doesn't really matter what I play or sing...but I can't help but think about what my funeral is going to be like, despite how many detailed notes I'm going to leave specifying what I want (heh, a story for another day...)  So I sit here at just-after-eleven o'clock at night getting nervous about camp, thinking about other things...and my brain won't stop churning... It seems I've lost that productive edge I had a couple days ago. Hell, maybe it was even yesterday. But time and conscience has put me over the edge. It's like a medicated blur.   I need something to fish my brain out of this wastebasket routine.

      I went running in the rain today, despite waking up really sore this morning. Kindof hoping that this pain lasts for a week or more, because as crazy as it sounds, I really missed it. Just goes to prove once again that you can't really appreciate something until it is taken away from you...   But now it's back.   I've got 20 days to kick my butt and get back in shape before I go off to camp and get really fat again [sighs]. It's okay though. I only get to do this once a year. And in the meantime, I get to play 'Eye of the Tiger' over and over to feel more special and hardcore than should be allowed.   Being grounded has given me lots of time to do lots of nothing... weird stuff mostly, but that should be no suprise, considering.  I've feng shui-ed my room, pondered the mysteries of  urlLink mustard in a tube , read ANOTHER book (which means I have now read more in the last week than I have all year), searched the internet endlessly to find out how to do The Safety Dance (*ehm* OBSESSION), avoided sleep (not quite successfully, thanks to my janky broken alarm clock), started to teach myself how to play some songs on the piano, jammed on durbeke, played some viola and cello, and mastered internet tetris.  Looking forward to my date of freedom (Sunday July 4)...sortof painfully coincidental. In celebration, maybe I'll light myself on fire with a sparkler or something. That'd be cool.

      I feel quite productive today. I woke up  before  noon (woohoo), went running (only for 15 minutes, pathetic I know. But considering it's my first attempt after a 6 month hiatus thanks to surgery, it's not bad for me), did a few hundred crunches, and then I mowed the lawn (yay tan). For those of you who know how HUGE my lawn is, you may be able to appreciate the amount of physical work I've done today. Or maybe you won't appreciate it. That's your prerogative.   Anyhow, I sit here at the computer feeling pretty grungy, my puny girl arms hurt like the devil, I'm in serious need of a shower, and I'd give anything to curl up and take a nap. I feel awesome. Really awesome. I haven't felt this good (physically) in 6 months...   Had another strange dream last night... This time it wasn't quite as bizzare and lesbian, but still quite pretty weird.   It was: At camp (btw, I go there in 3 weeks), the last day. My cousin (Michelley) and I were checking out at the office when Jeremy Jabara (aka Hawaii) and Lauren Licata (with braces!!??) walk in. Jeremy takes one look at me and says "Heeeeyyyy... um... hi. How are you??"  I reply: "You don't remember me, do you? You have no idea what my name is."  He says: "You're right (smiles)" and then lifts me off the ground and says "It's okay though. You know how to jump bones? I could teach ya."  I laugh. He continues: "Give me kiss, sweetheart!"  ...at which point I wake up and bite a hole in my pillow.  [sighs] This whole sleeping thing really isn't working out well for my brain...I'm considering going back to my school routine of 3-4 hours a night. It's the only way to silence the conscience.

      Didn't sleep well last night...my night was plagued by anxiety and my mother. She came into my room last night at 4 a.m. and decided it'd be really cool to wake me up.   "Hey Grace, are you okay?"  "I'm hot."  "Are you awake?"  "Sorta..."  "Great! I can't sleep. Come downstairs and we'll be awake together!"   It was sorta bizarre, considering I'd had only 3 hours of sleep, considering she'd had even less than that. But I went along to see where her crazy antics would lead us.  Into the kitchen! For tea and laundry folding (mm mm, life rocks). I ended up crawling back in bed an hour later to try the whole sleeping bit again. I had little success thanks to the birds outside (they start their day before 5:30, news to me!). I was also curious to identify the overachievers in the neighborhood (the ones who beat the sun to work). Needless to say, this depressed the dickens out of me and the anxiety took over my precious available sleeping hours. Again. [sighs]   I gave up about 7:30, knowing that a pot of coffee could keep me awake throughout the day if I  really  planned to do anything, which I did not. I showered and decided that the best thing to do would be to go back to bed and let my inner unachieving self take the wheel. Bad idea...  The dream I had didn't really do anything to ease the anxiety I was having. Quick synopsis:   I was referee-ing an eating contest put on by The Man Show (slinky outfit and trampoline not included, sorry guys) when suddenly my *eh hem*  WIFE  threw a shoe at me. I turned around and she was laying on the floor (sortof disheveled) and had the other shoe in hand, ready to throw it at me, a playful smile on her face. I said "If you throw that shoe at me, I'm going to kick you in the mouth." She threw it at me anyway and I then proceeded to beat the crap out of her. She ended up unconscious, bleeding from the eyesockets onto the couch next to our little curly-haired son, who looked up at me and shook a finger scoldingly.  Freaked? Incredibly. Confused? Hella.   Think I'll just try to stimulate my brain a little today, rather than sleeping all day and reading more weird contemporary american plays. I really should know better than to let my brain rot as such. Besides, I've got stuff to do that I've procrastinated all week.   A great evenin to all and a fun-tastic weekend...

       well guys, it seems hard to believe that a year has gone by since i've visited the hills of PA... but here we are again, this time of year....&nbsp;i'm going tomorrow. i'm excited...i'm nervous...i'm...a lot of things. i'm not packed yet. it's sortof been a process today... and it's going very very slowly. i'm finding pictures from last year, i'm debating on how many pairs of shoes i'm going to need this year...petty shit like that. and many loads of laundry later, i'm still unprepared.    &nbsp;  at this point i sortof want to curl up in a ball and cry for a while because i'm afraid. i'm not ready. but that's not really an option for me, and i know alex would probably kick my ass too. he would sound something like this: "last year you weren't looking forward to it and you were afraid&nbsp;and then you had a great time...so stop worrying so damn much and just do it."    &nbsp;  [sighs]    &nbsp;  well john is home from retrieving gangway's gook ass, so i'd better go say hi...  &nbsp; &nbsp;  hugs n kisses, the queen

      A good day. Woke up early, made a KILLER breakfast for myself. It rocked my world. Nick came over, I made lemon pudding (which is all gone now) and then Angela came over. We hung out around the house while the 'rents went to retrieve John from U of M. It was a pretty damn good time if I say so myself. Definitely what I needed.    I ended up going to the Pride of Toledo practice on Tuesday (yestrday, although it's after 1 AM now, so technically 2 days ago) and it was a wonderful experience. Mr. Lewis was psyched to see me and he introduced me to several of the ladies. Overall, I'd say its the most energetic group of women I've seen with ages ranging from late twenties to sixties and seventies. It was amazing...and they were great, too. It's definitely something I want to be a part of in the near future...as of now their age limit doesn't include youngins like me but there is talk of lowering the age limit to 16 (yay). In that respect I think my visit was good; it showed an interest from the group they're aiming to include.   Fox News says theres a convict loose. In Sylvania. *throws hands in air in exasperation* well if I wasn't cautious enough before now I'm going to be totally OCD. Nobody better be sneakin around my house with chainsaws or you'll have it coming to you bigtime.   I swear to the smashed mailbox out front.

      Went to the zoo with Alex and Alaina yesterday. It was great...she's a sweetie and definitely a very good baby. Went nuts over the penguins. I was pleased. Ofcourse, walking around with a baby got me some pretty strange looks (4 smiles, 7 frowns, 18 confused faces) and one guy who checked me out (even though I was standing next to a stroller at the time) had a black eye and was chaperoning some retards.  Hot day, but good for the most part.   Successful morning: I woke up at nine with my alarm clock, went for a run (humid day=bad... stupid Toledo), planted flowers with my mommy and got paid (cha ching). Showered n ate lunch and then went to the mall with Angela.   Unsuccessful Hobo Hunt: Angela and I went looking for Nick's hobo ass, because he had called her from the mall. So we walked all the way around the mall THREE TIMES to find him and give him a ride (did a little shopping meanwhile). Ofcourse, if Nick had a cell phone it would have been much easier and excess exercise and sickeningly sweet coffee would have been avoided.  I came home to find him sitting at my kitchen table talking to my mommy. *GRR*  So now I sit here wondering if I'm going to go to the Pride of Toledo practice or not. It's in 2 hours. I want to go watch and I'm sure my mom would tote my bum there if I asked...*scared* I think they'd let me sit there and watch but then again they might not...  I'm gonna go get ready and find the whereabouts of my mommy. [now wheres my  urlLink waffle sundae???? ]

      A very strange weekend...definitely had its ups and downs (mostly downs). It was one of those times where I could have not been alive and things still would have functioned fairly well, if not better. I did nothing on Friday, and after a failed attempt at running yesterday I cried and ate lunch. Not quite sure what exactly was the matter, but motivation wasn't happening at all.   I made a point to get my ass out running again this evening. Was fine until 4 minutes in, I got a huge cramp in my ribs...so I could only go for 12 minutes. I got home and collapsed on the floor and my mom sortof freaked.  Later, when my dad finally came home from his bike ride (Old Man fell down and got hurt bigtime) I went over to Michelleys and swam-first time this year-got to wear my awesome pink bikini. I was excited. We ate quiche too, which makes it all the better. *sighs* not a bad evening.   AND then...   I have a request for all of you religious types: please please please...pray for my cousin Benjamin. He has a cancerous tumor in his brain and after surgery 3 months ago, he is now undergoing chemotherapy. This chemo has to be strong enough to wipe out his immune system (so it can reach his brain). He had a bone marrow transplant so he can later have his own cells replaced in his body. Ben also has to bathe 5 times a day because the chemo is so strong, that it seeps through his skin and burns him. It's also burning his internal organs. He is in so much pain that morphine isn't doing anything.  So if you don't mind, please keep Ben in your prayers. He's 10 years old. This is his 2nd bout with cancer.    Makes me feel like a serious scheister.

      Cedar Point trip (yesterday) was incredibly successful. Nobody got lost or hurt or anything tragic like that, and I finally rode all the big kid rides (thanks to Maggie) and I'm pretty sure I'm over my fear of roller coasters now that it's happened.   But goooooddddd, I woke up this morning and couldn't move. My spine is bruised, purple-ish blue and my hips hurt like the dickens. I feel old. Arthritis old. It could have been the 7.5-ish miles I walked, or maybe it was the 25,000 steps I took ... or maybe it was being on my feet all day. Maybe it was getting stuck in line for the Millennium Force for 2 and a half hours while it rained (Gracie soaked+white shirt+dirty,gawking people= BAD ). It was fun though. Nothing a little advil can't fix.   And I got a little bit of color too, despite my obsessive use of sunscreen. Didn't want to be a lobster for camp (I leave in 10 days. call me if you want to help me shop).   I really did nothing today, which suited me just fine. I woke up late, made smoothies with my mommy, and a few hours later, punked out for a nap. When I woke up it was about 3... so I cleaned my room (more feng shui) and tried to stretch the soreness out of my hips (harder than it sounds).   It's almost nine now and I'm thinking that summore sleep would be the best thing for me...ya know, considering I don't feel like doing much else...  I should fix that damn mailbox.

      It's nice to be free again *insert dance of joy here*. I've continued with the running and other such self-seeking activities, despite newfound liberation. It's like spring cleaning, only four months late.   Starting to get in another one of those deviously crafty moods again, and after finding some incredible crap that I'd forgotten I had, the art world may be crying bitter tears tonight. Especially considering the kinds of dreams I've had lately (as aforementioned), a creative outlet of some sort would undoubtedly be beneficial...   Maybe it's something in the water. Or lack of oxygen to the brain. Divine intervention? Or maybe my health is going to fail me soon and I'm having one of those turn arounds that people often do before they die.   Either way, I know that my mother is certainly freaking out. The bills from John's grad party just arrived in the mail...that means several days of obsessive compulsive cleaning and yelling on her part. Several days of hell for the rest of us. [Which I suppose won't be so bad, considering tomorrow I'll be at Cedar Point all day with the NV orchestra.] Granted, I'm doing my best not to leave anything around that could show I actually live in my house. It's the only way to avoid having my entire room thrown into a BFI dumpster.  Sure, sleeping on the floor wouldn't be so bad, but there is a lot of stuff that's neatly organized and I would be PISSED if it got ransacked.   And someone smashed our mailbox.

      Watched the SPEBSQSA webcast of the 66th international barbershop convention for incredible amounts of time Thursday, yesterday and today. Sorry I've been slacking on the posts. All those late night "barbershop talk" conversations with Tim/Jeremy and Clayton have had me up at strange hours of the night. But it's been incredible.   Disappointed that Max Q didn't take home the gold. Really crushed. *stares at smashed heart sitting on the floor* It was their first year competing as a quartet and they  did  lose to 30 year participators (Gotcha!). So it's politics really. Not to say that Gotcha! wasn't amazing too... *shrugs* I don't know. I'm probably just being biased.   Funeral for the old lady went well on Thursday. I got several compliments on my singing (which is a little morbid, I know. But I appreciated the compliments). What really crushed me was that she really didn't have many friends show. I think there were 2 friends, a co-worker, and no family. Props to my mommy for doing a great job arranging for the ceremony (mom was the lady's legal custodian).   This afternoon, a funny thing happened. For the first time that I can ever remember, my dad cut short my grounding sentence. I was shocked. I was on the phone and he comes into the room and says "Grace, I'd like to set you free. So call some friends and make plans so you can go out tonight."  It was sortof touching... but my reply to him definitely confirms my addiction/obsession and devotion to barbershop:  "Eh, thanks Dad, but I'm gonna stay home and watch the barbershop webcast tonight."   Yeah. His face dropped. I'm such a dork and I love it.   I desperately need to form a quartet. If not through school, then I don't know where. Maybe I'll find some local-ish people at Harmony Camp *excited*. But God, it's something I need like you wouldn't believe.   Well, I'm off for a restless night... take care.

      Despite today's pseudo-productivity, the best part was definitely watching the webcast of the S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A. 66th International Competition (in Louisville, KY). It was amazing, to say the least. I was incredibly impressed with many of the quartets that performed in the Quarter-Finals, and I look forward to the Semi-Finals tomorrow (Friday) night.   It's one of the stranger things about me: I'm OBSESSED with barbershop harmony. Like nobody's business. Watching the competition is a huge thing for me, and it would have been really really cool if I'd been able to go down to Louisville to watch it live.   Maybe some day.  ANYHOW...  I went running again today, and the great feeling continues. I haven't really seen a whole lot of difference in my appearance yet, but I suppose that should pale in comparison to the feeling good part. And I do feel good.  I played some piano too.   I also washed the kitchen cabinets today, because I'm a damn good kid. I'm a damn good kid, AND I got rid of bad karmic(spell check?) energy today...by burning old notes and love letters. It's the last portion of the feng shui business that I did to my room. The theory is/was that by keeping the notes, I was keeping a part of my past and that inturn was affecting my ability to grasp the present (I think?). So I've now let that part of me go (in a flaming inferno that had the neighbors wondering...) and I feel pretty good about it.   Short post, no doubt, but I'm going to hit the hay early(heh heh, early...). It's a beautiful night. Not a sleeping night. Nevertheless, lots to do tomorrow.    Take care, y'all.

       Well folks, the crappy weather followed me home from the hills of western PA.  I haven't had the motivation to be hardcore or else I would have run in the rain. Or heat.       Familiar tune, eh?      I babysat for the first time in months yesterday.  Definitely a good day, minus the popcorn eating and movie watching. Being lazy isn't what I need right now, not to mention it's the third time in less than a week that I've seen a movie.  I've been a total fattie (heh heh).       Lots of loose ends...it's been sortof an emotional last 24 hours.  I picked up my camp pictures from Meijers w/ Michelle last night. Granted, I did get made fun of severely for carrying that crazy diesel sized camera around with me....but it took some great pictures.        I also told my parents about my dear boy :) .        But, their reaction was much better than expected...even though I'm still sortof confused as to how they took the news.   Atleast they know where my heart is now.

      I'm finally home after my two weeks at the Antiochian Village. All in all, it was one of the greatest experiences of my life. [As Drew Haas would say, "The Village is a spiritual rebirth."]  There are so many people to thank... great times, great memories.   Feels like part of me has turned a new leaf.  I came home exhausted on Friday and ate dinner with the family, saw Ashley (my momma),  then slept for close to 15 hours. Granted, this pales in comparison to the 20+ hours I usually get when I come home from camp...but I had stuff to do, and it was sortof hard to sleep because I'm sick.  The past 2 days have been laundry, Popeye's chicken and junkfood and watching videos w/ Michelle and Anton, sleeping, missing Cory, and trying to sing in church (which didn't work out too well since I'm totally The Sick).  Plans for tonight include watching Erin Craig's last ballet performance (before she moves to FL)at the Toledo Zoo Amphitheater, then going to see M. Night Shyamalan's The Village. Quite appropriate, considering where I just came home from...   Hugs and Kisses~ the queen
