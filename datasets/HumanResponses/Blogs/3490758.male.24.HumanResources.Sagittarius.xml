      Hahaha.  Yes, it is gay.  Gayer than a vicar.  And everyone knows those mofos be gay, yo.  The Day After Tomorrow. That is another thing that is gay.  That film was gay.  Big Brother is also gay.  Especially this year, when the house is so gay, I swear if you turn the volume up, you can actually HEAR the HIV viruses (virii?) rattling their happy way about their hosts' gay little bloodstreams.  This was a gay message.  You are gay.

      I am pissed off!  Give me gmail now or face my shitty wrath.  Ah, who am I kidding.  If you are misfotuntae enough to read this, then you are really stupid.  I mean, it's bad enough to make your own 'blog' (I use the little ''s for no real reason other than to look like the awesome loser that I am), but to actualkly look at mine just because it had naughty words in the header?  Looooooossssseeeeerrrrrrrrrrr  I wonder how many more of these stupid things I have to make to get gmail.  Here is a swear word in bold.   CUNT !  Hahaha.  Awesome.

      I don't care what these say, so I am just going to cut and paste the first document I find on my computer:  Welcome to QuickTime 5  QuickTime is Apple's award-winning, industry-standard software architecture for creating, playing and streaming digital media for Mac OS and Windows.

      I have made this blog randomly in the vague hope that I will then get the Power Of Gmail.  Nobody will ever read this except me, so if it's based on popularity then I'm fucked, yo.  So, Mr Google dude, if you're not too busy waxing your Ferrari, spanking a young boy, or eating tofu, or whatever it is you rich geeky guys like to do when you're not subtly taking over the internet, give me a gmail account.  Or I kill you with axe, fuckfaces!  I am so bored.  Tum ti tum ti tum.  This blogging stuff is gay.  Incidentally, I didn't win the lottery this week.  Fucking rip off.  I tells ya.    I also need a better job.  My job sucks.  Well, the job doesn't, but the pay does.   If I got paid more, I would totally stay.  But I'm torn between staying in the benefits department, or taking this lab job.  The lab job pays a little better, but is further away, crappier hours, and there's no hot ladies like there are in Shire Hall.  Cock cockety cock cock.  That is my first blog.  Let's see if the bold thing works -  Tits!   Yep, it works.  Titties are awesome.
