      It seems I have a lot of stuff to catch up on. Here goes...  Well it was a pretty monotonous week of WE. There was light at the end of the tunnel, as on Wednesday I acquired the new McFly album. It's really good. Lots of guitars. Does quite rightfully set them apart from Busted, although you can tell James Bourne has worked with them on this, thanks to the unmistakable almost cartoon-like descriptive lyrics. But yep. Cool. On Friday we went to see Taboo, the Boy George musical! Dead good. We went to the earlier performance because mother was worried that there may be 'a lot of homosexuals' at the late one. I asked her why it was a problem; "I didn't think it would be very good for  you ". Homophobe. She really is. Not in a bad way. Just weirdly homophobic.  So okay, last week of term before ze summer. Hurrah! Went on an art trip today to the Liverpool Tate and Palm House in Sefton Park. I swear I saw Donny Osmond's tour bus outside the Summer Pops tent. I mean, I was only assuming, as he was to perform there tonight. It probably was. How cool. But if only...it had been...Busted and McFly. That would've been cool to a T. Or...*gasp* Scissor Sisters. *girly scream* YAHIWUDDHAVDIED! Nah. But maybe I would've attempted to stray from the group to track them down. They didn't even play Summer Pops, actually. Busted and McFly did, though. What the fuckery am I going on about. Anyway. It was a good trip *giggle...trip...haha*. I was in the cool group with the hippinest hoppinest hippy art teachers. You know the sort, they tell you that you don't have to be able to draw to be able to draw, etc. Ok, I'm gonna let loose a little on this blog. I was glad to be in that group because *swiftly nicks someone else's idea* neither K, T, S, B or especially E were there. I hung around with Steph, Mandy, Kim and Wes...erm...John. Also Tina, Jenny and Siobhan, who are all very nice people and fun to be around. Unlike K, T, S, B or E, they aren't constantly out there to put someone down at the slightest chance. They aren't pretentious spoilt little bastards (oh my god how fun is this). Whenever I'm with, well, Steph and the gang, K, T, E and this other person A will decide to ignore me, divert everyone else's attention from me. This is because they've decided that I've structured and held together that friendship group well enough now, and like L, I can bugger off. But unlike L, who buggered off of her own accord, very good plan, I don't really want to bugger off yet, because there is nowhere to bugger off to. But I'm not cool enough for them anymore. I'm sure the fact that I wear glasses and hate alcohol plays a major role in my social uncoolness. Oh, the shame! Wearing glasses! I'm so sorry I wasn't born with 20/20 vision. It is so much my fault! As is my distaste in certain chemicals, apparently.  Tards.  I can see where this is going, I may need to make a 'background info' post.  Hmmmm, okay. I got an iPod, finally. It is legendary. I already have about 700 songs on it. I like this fact because it has the potential to make me lazier. Hahaha...  I have nothing left to say.

      On Sunday I went to see Shrek 2, followed by Harry Potter on Monday. In Shrek 2, there is a Fairy Godmother, and I couldn't help thinking how much her expressions/face reminded me of Lucy S. That's so weird. I like the word weird. Though I think I spell it wrong. Constantly. I had warm nachos with cheese at the cinema! I love nachos with cheese. At the cinema. And warm.  Wanted to go see McFly play free in the Trafford Centre, followed by a signing afterwards, but by the time I got home from work experience it wasn't worth it. Probably would've been packed. And my mum-of course-couldn't be bothered. *ze sigh*  Had work experience again today. A liiiiiiddle bit boring. Especially as there's these two new kids my age there, they know eachother so can work together on one computer, and they aren't a fraction as shy as I was (and still am). I have very stupid and serious people issues. It sucks. So there weren't any machines for me to use, and nothing for me to do (oh yeah-I'm at a newspaper) until the last hour I was there. This happened yesterday too. And will happen all week. Shit. I walked down to Runcorn's new Kwik Save in my lunch hour and bought Top Of The Pops magazine. Yay. I noticed their stock is already declining. Didn't see that coming *smirk*. I ended up reading TOTP on the car journey home instead though, because I was too fucking shy to ask anyone there if I could read it while sitting around. This is just stupid. My mum's taken me to several psychologists over the past few years and they've all been cunts. Finally we went to this one woman who worked by asking questions and stuff, which was better, but seeing as I can't even talk to people I'm not familiar with, we quit that one too. So I'm screwed, basically. Worked on my Scissor Sisters Street Team forum (not open yet). Will probably get sued for copyright, but hey. I can't see it happening honestly, because I'm a familiar face...username...on the forum. So they already should know I'm not a malicious kinda person. I hope. Am I? No! Noooo....Nah. Looking forward to another day of WE tomorrow. Yaaaaaaay...in a totally unsarcastic way...   Tom from McFly is very ugly. And Danny has silly hair. And Harry...Harry looks like an underpants model gone wrong! And Dougie? Dougie's just...Dougie! Dougie's ok actually. I'd feel screwy insulting him, he's only, like, one year older than me. And it's not like I'm trying to be mean or anything...it's funny with people a couple 'a years older than you! It just is...It's hard to explain!  Wow, what a "footnote" that turned out to be...

      I have permanently furrowed eyebrows and I'm always miserable, according to my mum. I try not to be miserable. Miserableness is one of my pet hates (especially with other people [People at school who worry about stupid things, like secrets they've told everyone then moan about the fact that everyone knows. Jacktards. [commonly known as 'attention-seeking']]). I honestly hope I don't come across as miserable.  I think I should stop worrying. I'm too paranoid.

      ...Today I woke up with very bad hayfever/flu/throat infection. Which was nice. I took a tablet which unfortunately caused me to vomit the contents of my stomach 5 minutes later. Today should be super-fun. I got up early and watched TV again. There's not much you can really do in the morning though, is there? And we have no decent food. No cereal, no (non-mouldy) bread and no soup, which usually make up the main components of my daily monodiet. Mum's really going downhill on the supermarket shopping front. Maybe I should start accompanying her.  I had crisps for breakfast again.  My dad keeps asking me if I want to go into Warrington with him this afternoon. He only wants trousers from Marks & Spencers...I don't think he feels particularly at ease shopping though...I'm only going if I can finally get an iPod (was supposed to get one on my birthday-13th June). I asked him. He started patronising me horrifically. Going on about a new model of iPod coming out around July/August. I've done endless research on this for god's sake. He was referring to a mini iPod which I decided long ago was rubbish. It's just a gimmick and pretty much the same price as a regular 15GB iPod. I am far more technologically-inclined than my dad. He just can't dig it. Hahaha...  I can't believe I just said 'dig it'...My standards are truly falling...   I feel an uncontrollable urge to play Spyro 3.

      Ew, don't look at my picture. Even though it's right on this page and you clearly have no choice and it really annoys me when people say they have crap pictures of themselves and tell you not to look at them then show you a page of ten 20cmx10xcm photos and it's so lame!  But don't look at my picture.

      Haven't done much today. Like most Saturdays. Got up at about half 7. Have been doing for the past month actually...makes a drastic change to years of getting up at 11. I dunno why...it just seems boring lying around in bed. So yeah...I got up right...then I had cookies for breakfast...and some prawn cocktail crisps...yeah! What happened to Saturday morning TV? SM:TV live was the last decent thing. Ah, the days of Zig and Zag...even the Big Breakfast used to be cool. And Live and kicking, when it was presented by Zoe and Jamie. I watched Diggin' it (ex Diggit-that also used to be cool, what happened?!). Watched Lilo & Stitch and Recess, possibly the only good Saturday cartoons left. Have spent the rest of the day on the computer, mostly Scissor Sisters forum. That place has been getting weird lately...loads and loads of schoolgirls and angry threads...and I wish people would stop posting about gigs at every opportunity. I can't go, please don't rub it in. Don't get me started (name witheld)...I think 'pretentious' has been given a whole new definition. He's had his 5 minutes of fame...why is he milking it for all it's worth? And who put him in charge of gig meet-ups? It's not in honour of him for god's sake. Shut up Heather...this is petty. Had a look at the McFly forum like I do every day...there really doesn't seem to be anything/anyone I can relate to there...this is probably because I do not wish to lay any of the band members. I must be crazy... One thing has been nagging at me since Friday...I mean, I've been insulted over msn about twice before and thought nothing of it except "HA! I pity the foo'!". Well there's this girl Becky H who I've been friends with since...shit, I don't know, our parents go way back...but yeah, she isn't usually on msn but has been a bit recently. I've never spoken to her over msn before. So out of the blue last Friday, we had this "conversation": Becky: Hi Me: Heya (some time later) Becky: Why do u always have wierd names Me: I dunno Me: It was something Paddy said on the SS message board... Becky: i never no who it is Me: I always have Heather at the beginning Becky: rite :| Becky: ok thn Becky: :| Becky: lmfao Becky: Wierdo Me: ok Becky: u fukin looser Becky: fuk u bitch Becky: oh n stop lookin like a man Becky: it dnt suit u  Yeah so you may just think she's being bitchy, and I'm just paranoid. But seriously...I would never have expected this in a million years...she doesn't know I've changed my email address though, so I can only guess she's mistaken me for someone else. I'll have to ask her straight at Cornwall in summer, otherwise things will just be wierd. Surely she'd know I'd tell my parents if she meant it for me (I haven't told them because it's so wierd). I don't get it. It's petty, but what are blogs for? HA! Maybe she was just drunk.

      Friv (Alix) Tom-we got as far as "hey" "hi". I know, surely your life can't possibly be that thrilling. Lucy S, who destroyed all my pictures...   Yes I am bored. And I've only just gotten into this whole blog thing. So I will post alot for a while. It's a novelty. Surely you understand?!  oh look, a tumbleweed...

      ...Bugger all. I have come to believe that computing does not count towards daily activity or nourishment. It does, however, count towards the following: 1. Vanity (I have a webcam. Shucks!) 2. Cellulite (I swear those stretch marks weren't there yesterday...go figure) 3. Headaches (affhazactly5ibupruffenanambihnumnow) 4. Bitching (Oh how clever! You called me a loser over msn and everything!) 5. Useless knowledge (Did you know that in the Lion King, the dust spells out the letters 'SEX'? No, I didn't either. Funny, that)  y'know the only good thing is that maybe you learn a teeny bit of HTML if you can be bothered...and laugh at other people's blogs...dwelling on their own terrible miserable lives...  shutting up now.
