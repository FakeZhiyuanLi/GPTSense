      Dancers of the nights Laces, sequins and satins Dancing away from all the lights Just in between of me  - Nad -

      How ironically funny this world is.... The least expected knocked on the door of my life unexpectedly. I opened the door only to find a beautiful Greek boh. Standing tall.... The epitome of a man... Enigmatic, Oomni, Sharp, Privlyekatyelni... Seized me from the real world and placed me on cloud nine. If there's any higher, i'm already there.... The wind beneath my wings. I will love him until my dying days......  - Nadrah -

      You can close your eyes to the things you don't want to see. But you just can't close your heart to the  things you don't want to feel.  Sigh~  Nady

      I dance to the feel of bliss and  the tune of true contentment. Choreographed by the love you give. Twirling and tapping like there's no tomorrow. Parading my heart like the participants of Mardi gras. Full of passion...full of elegance... Exotic, magical colours splash in the world that evolves around me.  Smittens me with your laconic heartfelt. I dare myself to melt but I melt all the same.  Will I be dancing to this feel and tune till the  stars won't shine; because I know it won't tire me out.  So take my hands, come dance with me....  For now, my love... For now...

      If living is an art, wouldn't I paint my life with colours? Skipping the greys and blacks. The winning colours will stay. No storms... No wars... No heartaches and no broken people... No tears... Well then...who am I to say... Such profound decision makings are not made by a puny someone like me.  Peace all...  - Nadzy -

      Give me one reason why i'm no longer an object of your interests, why i'm no longer the subject of your conversations. I'm drowning deeper and deeper each day. Wondering why i'm no longer the reason for your smiles, why i'm no longer the institution for  your confused mind. Are we still sharing the same feelings or have yours dried and withered sadly away...  - Nadrah -

      You can lash me with your words of anger or shoot me with your two by four. Kill me if you have to but just don't keep me in this cave of darkness and weary loneliness. Can't you see that i'm in pain...? Feeling sorry for my broken heart yet tryin to be  an iron inside. Even in this cold I can feel myself burning helplessly by your deliberate ignorance. What am I to you now? Am i just there to fill the vacant slot on  your leisure timetable? Tell me now for I can't stand this loneliness a second longer.  - Nadz -

         You roam my mind free of will. Driving me into an unseen force, Across the asphalted sky. Dancing to the tunes of graceful nature. Your exquisite taste in life... Living to the fullest. Not missing any given chances. You strive till you think i'm under your spell. Deriving from the thoughts of pure insanity. I, for once am letting you go. Begone before I could cause you harm. Anger within me is your untimely death...  - Nad -
