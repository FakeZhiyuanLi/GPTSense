      Sputter...sputter..Today TODAYYYY (he! Haw!)i for the first time in many days felt alive. today was the day when we in our business school got a business exercise.  to be brief the exercise involved our entire class to find such corporate executives in our city who were expatriates or executives of foreign origin and to ..Hold your breath .. Shadow them . which meant we would have to observe them going about doing their job. this whole exercise was to be completed in a span of 7 hours and also required us not to spend any money on any form of hired aomutation , which would now mean that we would have to go about the entire city (which means many corporates)..Hitch hiking.  with initial few hitches we all ultimately were off to our vaguely targetted destinations. i chose to go to the office of the Daimler Chrystler india situated at the farthest end off the city.i managed to reach the destination by hitch hiking  snd managing some how.aafrom then it was smooth sailing as i have my brother in law working with D.C. India . upon entering the office of D C India i was interoduced to two of the German executives on deputation from germany i had a 1 hour session with him as far as shadowing is concerned it was a complete no no with DC India as they said it was not a company policy to allow any such activity . all set and done by the end of it all i managed to reach my B school campus on time .    we then had a session with our teacher to discuss the procedings of the day . it was a wonderful learning experience and i would cherish this experience for times to come.

      the month --june the day 29th... the hour...(not yet) ladies and gentlemen i invite you all to the biggest success story of all times....Errrr or maybe not as big,but big enough to let my 6ft 3inch body frame seem pulverised, into as small a case as a case study.My wheatish comlexion seems to have improved not because of any bodily improvement but because of the dying signs of radiance...as they say radiance is brightest from a candle only when its almost exhausted. no never, i did not (right now iam knoding my head from left to right at the speed of light) expect a business school to be sooooooooo gruelling. PHEW! PHEW! PHEW!...oh sorry but those are the only sounds which i can expropriate out of my self...I CHOKE! CHOKE!.....to be contd....
