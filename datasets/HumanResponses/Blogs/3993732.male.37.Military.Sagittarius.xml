						    TEXT:  Ecclesiastes 3:1-8   THEME:  The seasons of faith   I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SEASONS    A.  &nbsp;Season - a time or part of the year during which a particular type of weather prevails. The time when something specified flourishes, develops, takes place, or is popular, permitted, or at it’s best.   B.  &nbsp;God wants you to know today that no matter what season of your life you are in right now that a change of season will inevitably have to come. Good or bad, happy or sad there will come a change of season. Are you willing to change also?   II. CHANGES  A.  &nbsp;We as people some times fight change we want things to stay the way they always have been. We want the things that worked before to continue to work.&nbsp;Change is necessary & good when it comes to growing spiritually.   B.  &nbsp;Each new season brings about a change for the earth. The leaves change colors &nbsp;& fall from the trees, the weather changes, days get shorter, nights longer  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  **You can’t wear your winter coat in the summer. Some  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seasons spiritually require more fasting than others. Some  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more prayer, more faith, more patience.&nbsp;  The things that comforted you last season&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; won’t&nbsp;  do this next&nbsp;season!**    III. FOUR SEASONS OF FAITH    A. &nbsp;Summer    1.  &nbsp; Summer is the time of enjoying the presence of the sun. The time  of blessing.   2.  &nbsp; This is the time to relax&nbsp; & enjoy the benefits of your life. When  you can take time to enjoy leisure activities.   3.  &nbsp;&nbsp; In the summer you not only see the Son but you feel His presence. The warmth of the Spirit as He touches you.   4.  &nbsp;&nbsp; It is also a time when you don’t have to cover yourself so much for  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; protection from the elements.   B. Autumn/Fall  1. &nbsp; Autumn is the time the trees shed their leaves. Those extra things &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that also draw precious energy. Energy that will be needed to last  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the coming winter.  &nbsp;&nbsp; -There is a season in your walk when you will need to get rid of  &nbsp;&nbsp; those things that are a drain upon your time & shed the things that  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hinder you like leaves drop them to the ground. Those habits &  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attitudes have to go if you are going to survive winter.   3. &nbsp;&nbsp;In autumn the farmer turns over the ground so last year’s stalks & stems can  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; become next year’s harvest. The freshly turned ground covered with  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manure form the mulch you need to prepare the ground & replenish  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the starving ground.&nbsp;Like the ground that has received little, you too need to be broken &  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned over, allowed to rest for a time, and prepared for the next growing season.   **ALL OF THAT GARBAGE & MESS YOU WENT THROUGH IN THE&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PAST. GOD IS GONNA USE THAT TO FERTILIZE THE SOIL OF  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YOUR FUTURE! THAT’S WHY YOU WENT THROUGH WHAT YOU&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DID. TO PREPARE YOU FOR THE BLESSING THAT’S TO COME!**    C. Winter    4. &nbsp;&nbsp;When winter comes everything looks cold & almost dead. This is when trees build up their&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strength for that burst of energy needed to grow in the spring.   5. &nbsp;&nbsp;Winter is also a time of waiting. There is no growth, the nights grow  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; longer, you see the sun but it’s rays don’t warm you. Winter can be a  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sad, lonely time.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -This is the time most of us cry out to the Lord out of desperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a child waiting in line at a carnival. You see other people  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; getting their turn but you are forced to wait. But your turn will come.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The important thing about lasting a season is a patient perserverance &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that is sensitive to the timing & divine purpose of God.  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-You see a sense of timing cannot be faked. It’s like watching a choir  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; & there’s that one guy desperately trying to clap on beat. Or in basic  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; training when you’re learning to march & there’s always that one  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; guy not only tripping over his feet but everyone else’s.   TIMING IS  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CRUCIAL TO LASTING A SEASON    &nbsp; &nbsp;-When winter is particularly cold & bitter some people wont make it  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through. They did not prepare for this season when the blessings  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where falling this past summer. They thought summer would last  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forever. But it didn’t.  &nbsp;-Sometimes it may warm up for awhile but then during the night  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; temperatures drop below zero. Some of us took that as a sign that&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;winter is over & started to bud &amp; blossom out of season & die.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is when the planted seeds of promise will be watered thoroughly with the tears of&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struggle.   Remember…     (Psalms 126:5 NIV)   “Those who sow in tears will reap with songs of joy”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  **No one can water these seeds in your life but you. No matter  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how many people hold your hand, you still must shed your  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; own tears. Others can cry&nbsp; WITH  you but no one can cry&nbsp; FOR&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you !   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;** Some folk may get mad & try to fight the season. Trying to  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; protest the fact that they have to endure this. That’s OK you  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can protest all you want. You can put on a bikini or a speedo  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; & grab a sign &amp; protest until your little heart is content. But  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when you get over your pneumonia it’ll still be winter.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  ONLY GOD CAN CHANGE THE SEASONS!!!!!!!!!!!!    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Spiritual winter may bring tears. Crying is good. Tears must  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flow. But you must know when you have shed enough tears.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don’t get stuck in a pity party. Don’t flood the crops. A certain  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amount of tears are needed during the season of sowing but  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don’t let the devil keep you weeping.  &nbsp;&nbsp; - LORD IT’S BEEN A LONG WINTER. I DON’T KNOW WHEN  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IT’S GONNA END BUT I KNOW THERE’S A REASON FOR  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE SEASON!!   &nbsp;  -TEARS MAYBE FOR THE WINTER BUT  JOY  IS FOR THE  &nbsp;&nbsp; SPRING!!!    B. SPRING   &nbsp; &nbsp;  (Psalms 126:6 NIV)  &nbsp;  He who goes out weeping, carrying seed to  &nbsp;&nbsp; sow, will return rejoicing ,bringing his sheaves with him. &nbsp;  1.  &nbsp;&nbsp; Spring is a time of renewal. The time of growth. The time when those seeds that were planted burst forth in all their beauty. The time to cast off the weight off that winter coat. To shake off the sluggish spirit of slumber.    (Psalms 1:3 NIV)  Like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers.    2.  &nbsp;&nbsp; Spring is the green light season. You feel as though you have been waiting without seeing any results. Suddenly the light changes from red to green & you are free to move. You can now accomplish things you tried to do at other times but could not perform.  &nbsp;   *** THE DEVIL HAS CAUSED SOME OF YOU TO MISS  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YOUR &nbsp;SEASON. HE’S &nbsp;BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THAT “IT’S NOT THE RIGHT SEASON FOR THIS IT’S  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOT THE RIGHT TIME FOR THAT.” BUT I’M HERE TO  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SAY THAT THE DEVIL IS A LIAR!!! ONLY GOD  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONTROLS THE SEASONS & GOD IS ABOUT TO MOVE  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SOMEBODY INTO A NEW SEASON!!!***
