      I'm sitting here at the restaurant right beside the dorms hanging out with my anatomy professor and some folks in my class.  We're watching the Minesota vs. Sacramento game and prank calling people in the United States.  Actually, we're getting people to call us long distance! lol  Yes, that's what we do for fun on this island!    Well, aside from that, school is getting crazy once again!  I could have never imagined how complicated how epithelial and connective tissue could have been!  Anyhow, back to studying!

      Since my last entry, I've had some rather interesting conversations.  For example, last night, my roommate got a call from some of the girls on our floor in the dorms, and they were bored and wanted to chit-chat.  Ok, that's cool, but when I got there, I was totally disghusted.  Some of the girls were talking about how much they wanted to get layed and so on and so forth.  As soon as that nonsense came up, I just got up and left.  They claimed that it was their New York attitude, however, I have to totally disagree with that.  Anyhow, that was that.  Today was pretty good though.  My Chemistry mark was bumped up a couple of marks, and I aced my medical terminology exam :)  School was somewhat alright, though, our internet access back at the dorms may be on wait. Apparently, the Internet company lost my friends' order!!!  Talk about inefficiency!!  I'm waiting for him to get back in the dorms to see if we can figure this out.     That, however, leads to my next concern.  There are quite a few leechers around here.  I really don't want random people (who I don't really trust) coming into my room every so often.  It will seriously annoy the heck out of me.  This internet issue may, however, be remedied for subsequent semesters.  I was asked to estimate the costs of setting up wireless internet in the dorms, so that all incoming students would have access when they arrive instead of waiting 2-3 weeks (or more) to simply get a DSL connection.  Definition of the day: NSAID - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug - drug that reduces inflammation but is not a steroid; examples include aspirin and ibuprofin and other inhibitors of prostaglandins, naturally produced substances that promote inflammation.  Ok, that's all for now!  PS: JL, I miss ya!! :(

      What a crazy two weeks it has been!  I really don't know where to start, so don't mind if this post is rather scattered.  Right now, I'm over at my friend Sirhan's place watching the basketball game while just relaxing over our round of exams on Friday.  So far, I've done quite well and I only hope that I can keep it up.  Honestly, there isn't that much to do around here.  After the initial shock of having a beautiful mountain view and a view of the ocean is over, it really gets boring.  Yes, there are quite a few extraordinary places here such as the Four Seasons Resort, but that's all there is.  There are a few local restaurants around here, but they are nothing like they are back home.  One, they are incredibly expensive!  I'm not used to spending $4USD for fries, or ~$10CDN for a hamburger and fries. Two, they are slow!!  Three, and I guess this is a subjective opinion, but the food just doesn't taste all too great.  It's certainly not McDonalds or Burger King.  What else can I say?  Well, how about my first night here.  It was honestly, one of the weirdest nights of my life.  It probably started in Miami, Florida when I tried to use a payphone and realized that all the payphones there wer nothing like they were/are in Canada.  Also, things were quite expensive!  I know it's an airport, but prices were about double the price as compared to Toronto.  That wasn't it for my price shock.  When I got to Puerto Rico, I payed $6.25USD for a personal sized pizza!!!  That was honestly the most expensive pizza I've ever eaten.  I thought that was the end of it, but nooooo, things just got even more weird.  When I arrived in St. Kitts ar about 8pm EST, boy was I in for a shock.  I was lucky to meet one of my professor's there in the airport, but the shock was just starting.  We got into a taxi (bus) and loaded quite a few suitcases onto it.  I think the cost was about $8USD.  Now, on the way to the dock was just ridiculous, and outright weird.  There is this strip of small stores, and just put this into perspective, it's a Friday night in the Caribbean, people are partying and just having a fun time on the streets.  There were some guys jumping around and dancing on cars!!    So here's comes the ferry ride to Nevis.  It's hot, and the people were just throwing all the luggage on the ferry.  Now here I am, in a weird place, and my luggage is underneath the luggage/items of the locals.  I'm freaking out that it might simply disappear when we dock at Nevis.  So then, about 20 minutes into the ride, it starts to pour.  Non-stop rain for about 5 minutes and everything gets soaked!  Then it stops.  And then it goes again, and then it stops.  So just as we're docking at Nevis, then rain really starts to pour, and everyone on the ferry starts a mad rush towards their luggage.  I'm freaking out that my stuff is about to get stolen in the rush, and with the rain, I was ready to simply see my stuff disappear in the rain.  Thankfully, no such thing happened, but it was quite an experience.  Once I had all my stuff, I got in the school van, and had my first experience of wrong sided driving as well as the crazy roads on Nevis.  Instead of having speed bumps, there are ditches!!  Also, half the roads on this island are unpaved!!  So yeah, things are weird around here.  Once I got to the dorms, it was all good.  I have a great room on the second floor and I've met some great people here over the past few weeks.  That's all for now!

      Whoa, I'm finally back from the Mariott!  It's been absolutely crazy these past several days.  I had block exams on Friday, and I'm pretty sure I got at least a B in all of them (80+ around here), and likely an A in 3/4 courses I hope.  Chemistry was the only thing that didn't go so well.  How did that happen?  Well, it was 100 questions, and some of them were ridiculously long.  Honestly, how the heck were we supposed to do like 40 calculations, as well as another 60 theory questions in 2 hours?!    News from our professor is that the entire class didn't do so hot.  I'm sure that I did ok, but damn, I'm realizing how easy it is for a professor to set a hard test around here (aka: screwing the class).  In terms of other tests, Histolgy and Neurobiology went fine.  Med term. was also a lot better than I anticipated.  500+ words in 2 weeks = not bad :)  So, no worries there whatsoever.  So with that, thus my first month here in terms of medical school. Only 2 months to go :)  Hrm, so right after exams, I came straight back to the dorms, and headed over to the ferry to goto St. Kitts with Rajan, Sophia and Sirhan.  The ferry ride wasn't long, and we arrived in St. Kitts at around 5pm.  We met up with one of Sophia's friends there who took us over to the Mariott Resort.  Holy $@#%!,  The place looked insane!  It's not as posh as the Four Seasons, but it was absolutely incredible!!  We looked around and enjoyed the sights for a bit, and then headed over to our room which was quite huge.  We rested for a short while, and then headed over to the Casino.  I don't gamble (yeah, many reasons for that..), but my friends did and they had quite a good time.  There were some big wins, and some big losses, but all in all, it was a fun experience.  After that little bit of fun, we went over to this restaurant Bobbsy's with Sophia's friend for a party with the local med students.  The atmosphere there was very different from Nevis, and students there just seemed like they were all enjoying themselves.  There are obvious caveats with that considering Windsor's reputation, so to make it simple, party schools don't really make good medical schools.  Anyhow, after that, we headed back to the Mariott to their club Tiger's.  It wasn't too bad as it was where the afterparty took place.  Sirhan and I played some of the local students in pool, and simply put, Sirhan kicked their asses with a little bit of help from me, lol.  So that was that, we eventually got back to our room at 3am or so.  It was a fun day, but even as I'm writing this, I felt that something, or rather someone was missing :(  You know who you are, and I really wish you were there.  :(  The only thing that sucked today is that we had to return our car.  We left the car at the docks with the window's open, and the owner pretty much got ticked off when he saw it and wanted it returned.  Yes it is a very small island, and the locals seem to know everything that is going on.  And yes, me being me, said to put up the windows when we parked it and my friends said to not bother with it.  Lesson learned, oh well.  Ok, time for bed.  Bye.

      That last post was my first post, and this is my second post from my own internet connection!!  256kbit ADSL which isn't too bad.  It's going through about 3 concrete walls getting to my desk.  Ok, ciao.

      Well, not really wonderful, but things have been pretty upbeat around here lately.  I'm working for the school setting up the LAN, which has been an interesting project thus far.  Also, Sophia hooked up a car for herself, Rajan and I!!  Finally, we won't have to worry about getting rides off people.  Hrm, what else is new around here?  Well, a fellow just left for back home the other day because he was starting to feel ill.  It's a shame though, he was the one who I came to the island with the first night here.  I guess that's life.  Anyhow, that's it for this brief update.  I gotta get back to everything from terminology, to neurobiology and anatomy.  Word of the day:  Achondroplasia - Decreased growth of cartilage in the growth plate of long bones resulting in dwarfism; a genetic disorder.

      Today was probably one of the coolest days that I've had on this island.  I went over to the Four Seasons Resort with Rajan, Sirhan and Sophia.  The resort is absolutely incredible!  I actually felt that I had left Nevis for back home or even the United States!  Everything was clean, and there were quite a few people from England, Australia and North America.  It was funny though, some people were giving us strange looks probably wondering what all these "kids" are doing at such a fancy resort.  After lunch, we visited the gift shop and they had some very fancy gifts there for quite reasonable prices and I know what I'm getting you folks when I get back in Toronto in August. :)  I'm sitting down right now trying to work on my stupid chemistry assignment.  It's pretty damn boring and rather useless.  Anatomy is getting quite rough, and honestly, I hate histology and neurobiology.  Ok, here's the mnemonic for the day,  Multipolar cells: Are called multipolar due to multiple dendritic branches.  Four types of multipolar neurons: PIMP - Purkinjee cells, Interneurons, Motor neurons, and Pyrimidal cells.    That's all!

      I had this page open earlier, but then my roommate distracted me cause he wanted and is currently on his way to St. Kitts with Sophia and Sirhan.  That is craaaaazy!  We have exams next week, but to each his/her own I guess.  They're gonna have fun ;)  The Anatomy quiz went fine today.  I made a retarted mistake...rather, I second guessed myself for no reason.  For one of the questions in the matching portion, I selected 3-5 layers for the stratum spinosum, when it is in fact 8-10 layers, which I put for the stratum granulosum.  Why? I dunno, just being stupid I guess.  I got everything else right though (I hope!) :)  We also had a really interesting guest lecture today by Dr. L. about MI's (myocardial infarctions), aka: heart attacks, and went over most of the angioplasty procedure, aka: how you go in with a catheter, technically called a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to remove an occlusion of an artery in the heart.  Honestly, this stuff is off the hook!!  He showed us some videos of  him  going in and removing an occlusion out of a 60 year old patient.  He also went over quite a bit of the pathogenesis, and complications that can arise.  Now, here's some symptoms that occur wihen a MI is occuring in a patient: perocardial pain, epigastric pain that may extend into the jaw or arms, pallor, diaphoresis, nausea and dyspnea.  There may also be a burning sensation.  Cool eh?  Hrm, other than that, things are ok.  I feel weird sometimes, because I didn't think that I'd miss my friends (namely JL) as much as I do...only 70 days left :(  Bye for now.

      Today, nothing interesting really happened.  School was fairly normal I guess.  Though, I'm finding it harder and harder to stay awake during chemistry!  There's no possible way to actually follow our professor half the time, so I just sit back and play around on my laptop.  I know, I know, I should pay more attention, but you'd be the same if you were here ;)  We didn't do too much in anatomy or neuro either.  Though, I was just studying over the integumentary system for the past several hours.  Hrm, I'm not too sure if I've mentioned this, but I've been working with one of my professors and 2 of my classmates wiring up all the labs and prof's offices throughout the school with DSL.  It's a huge project, and we've made quite a bit of progress in just a few days.  We're almost done completely wiring up the administration building, and were wiring up the anatomy and histology labs today.  It's actually quite a bit of work, as we were running wires in the ceilings.  Fun times, and we are getting paid after all. :)  On another note, I can't believe that it's almost graduation :(  It really sucks that I can't be there.  That's life I guess.  That's all for my ramblings today.  Bye bye.

      Today was just one of those days.  I woke up at 7:30am, which is over an hour late for me.  Thankfully, Sirhan hadn't left yet, so he gave my roommate and I a ride to school.  As soon as we arrived, the first thing we did was check our chemistry grades.  All I can say is that I was very, very, lucky and relieved!!  Yes, the class didn't do so hot, but I thankfully managed to do rather well.  Anatomy also went just as well as I had anticipated, though, I feel so dumb for missing the bonus marks.  Now get this, the question was, "name 3 types of membranes and list their functions".  I was soooo thinking in terms of cell structure that I just wrote down plasma membrane, nuclear membrane and ribosomal membrane, while totally ignoring what I should have put down - namely serous, mucous, and synovial membranes. DUH!  Right now, I'm in the process of trying to memorize about 50 words.  Here's a word and some clinical applications of it: Angina pectoris – a feeling of constriction around the heart or pain that  may radiate to the left arm or shoulder, usually brought on by exertion; caused by insufficient blood supply to the heart.  Oh yeah, before I forgot, I actually installed AIM today.  Yes, I hate AOL, but all the American's here use it so I was coerced into installing it, lol.  Ok, bye.

      What an uneventful day.  I'm sitting here in my room looking over another 378 words to memorize, which will bring my medical terminology knowledge to over 1000+ new words in one month.  Apparently, there's another several thousand to go at this point!  I also just got back from dinner at Pimo's with Haran and Sadis.  We've pretty much been chilling all day, and  we're already dreading school tomorrow.  Only 2.5 months left for the semester, and 5 sets of block exams to go!  Ok, that's it for now. Bye bye.

      It's 6:50am and I am already studying.  The wonderful woes of med school!  I didn't have time to write anything hhere yesterday whatsoever.  I was pretty much memorizing words all day, and I had to finish off a chemistry assignment.  Then my roommate and Sophia copied it off me, lol.  Oh well.  Ok. now off to school to study some more while eating breakfast!

      For some reason I thought it was 2T4!  In anycase, congratulations to everyone who graduated today!!  It's been quite a journey to this stage in ourlives, and I can only hope and pray for further success to everyone.  I think that I am very lucky to have a good circle of close friends, and all the memories we've had at UTM for the past 4-5 years will be with me for the rest of my life.  It was fun while it lasted, and I look forward to the next 75 years!  Also, JL, I am very proud of you!  I am very happy to see that you were happy today :)  I'm actually laying on my bed right now listening to a Rumi CD (well actually MP3's I made from the CD) which one of my friends in class hooked me up with today.  This mystic poetry is awesome!  Oh and before I forget, I dont think I'm going to St. Maarten this weekend after all.  One of my profs decided to give us a quiz on Friday because nearly everyone plagiarized an assignment!!  No, I didn't, I cited everything, but that pisses me off.  Med students who plagiarize...that's sad!!  Also, another weird thing happened to me today.  Apparently, people around the school are hearing from profs that I'm some sort of genius or something.  Some dude who is in 4th semester told me that Dr. J. was telling him how smart I am, wtf! lol  It's funny how things are around here.  People were today, still trying to figure out what marks I had.  Sad...and funny!  Ok, I don't know what else to write...I'll write back later tonight I think.

      ...has the time gone??  This week has been absolutely craazy!  I had block exams on Friday and they went quite good, aside from Dr. G's class! WTF!!  Class average of 65%!!  I got completely rocked for whatever reason.  What makes no sense whatsoever is that neurobiology was insanely difficult and complex yet I did very well on it.  Hrm, aside from that, school has been good.  In terms of people around here, there is a certain person who I thought more highly of until they were "tested".  Literally, they are here "only for themself", and is hence being cut-off.  Here's the story.  We went to the airport yesterday to try to get tickets for St. Marteen for mid-semester break, but one of our friends wasn't with us.  As we were getting our own tickets, I told them to ask to see how many tickets/seats are left so that we can either a) get tickets for our friend(s) or b) tell our friends that there are only a few tickets left.  The person, instead of saying it was a good idea to ask, rudely replied back to me that "I'm here for myself...if someone else wants tickets, I don't care.."  I replied back, "You're not going to be a successful doctor with that attitude..." and they replied back, "yeah, whatever..."  Also, this person has been pissed off at my roommate for the past week.  And get this, either this person is really not cluing in, or something is messed up.  Last night, they ordered a pizza for themselves, and didn't even offer a slice to anyone!! Unbelievable!  That's three strikes - and time to be cut-off.  Good luck getting through the next little while ;)  Now, aside from that, which must all be taken into context, I can't wait until I get back home.  There are like 60 days left!!  And tomorrow is the UTM Graduation!  JL, congrats!!  I wish you the best!  Bye for now!

      Ack!  I'm sorry!! I have been soooooo busy over this past week that I've totally neglected this blog.  So let's get to it.  First, I finally got a  urlLink Gmail  account!!  1000MB of email space, so I'll probably never have to delete an email again.  Those of you who know me know that I like to archive everything, so this is totally awesome.  Hotmail is soon going to be giving us 250MB of space, and Yahoo! is also giving us 100MB of space now which is fantastic.  Ok, next.  I went to St. Maarten last weekend!!  It was the best time that I've had since I've been here.  We stayed at this place on the Dutch side called the Maho Beach Resort.  All I can say is that it was incredible.  AUC students must be having the time of their lives there in St. Maarten, as nearly all the luxuries you have at home are available.  Prices are very reasonable, and the people there actually care about efficiency!  Yes, that's the economist in my talking :P  Anyhow, other than that, this past week has been quite busy.  We did the cranial nerves and the brachial plexus in neuro, and spinal column in anatomy.  There was a ton of information, but I didn't seem to get anything wrong on the exams ;)  Woot!  Chemistry, however, was a complete shock!!  Let's put it this way, all the people with the top marks in the class (apparently) did rather poorly, and those students who were failing quite badly got the highest marks in the class!  It makes no sense whatsoever.  A number of us suspect that something very fishy is going on, namely a "nigerian scam" as we say around here.  I'll definately have to remedy this situation on Monday.  Ok, I'm getting tired.  Bye.

      Happy Canada Day!!  Canada is what, 137 years old now?  Anyhow, I wanted to post a rather interesting story yesterday, so here it goes.  Last week, as I've mentioned, chemistry grades were rather fishy.  Several students who were not doing so well in the course suddenly pulled the highest grades in the class, which made absolutely no sense considering their apparent understanding of chemistry.  One student in particular didn't know what an isotope was on Monday, nor did they know how to use an X-Y axis on Tuesday.  They also didn't know that the form that carbon dioxide takes in blood is bicarbonate, yet they apparently killed the acids and bases test in chemistry!  So is all this possible?  I don't think so.  I was rather intrigued by these marks and decided to talk to administration about it.  I told them that there may be something up with the marks, and that many students suspect that something may be going on with the grades and that students were lining up to talk to them.  Now, apparently our chemistry professor called a couple students informing them of what's going on after there was a meeting with the administration.  One of the students, a friend of mine, told me that what I did was F'd up.  Excuse me?  "Bay, you should mind your own business..."  Well, so should you ;)  In anycase, my argument was as follows, "It is my business because I have a right, by taking this class and paying tuition, to fair and equitable treatment. It is thus my business because all the students, including myself were not placed on a level-playing field." And yes, I don't think that potentially giving students tests in order to help those who are failing is a good deed in and of itself.  It actually hurts everyone in the end.  End of story.  So that's the type of drama that goes on here at times ;) The more and more I am away from home, the more appreciative I become of my friends, some of you in particular.  I can't believe that half the people here are actually going to become doctors one day.  At least I'm doing fine :)    Now, here's a medical mnemonic for the day: "She Looks Too Pretty, Try To Catch Her!"  Scaphoid, Lunate, Triquetrium, Psiform, Trapezium, Trapezoid, Capate, Hamate.  Those are the carpal bones, proximal to distal, lateral to medial.  And I'll be home in 43 days ok JL? :)   Ok, bye.

      I just finished studying for the night.  I've been memorizing words for the past 3.5 hours, and did another couple of hours of anatomy before that.  I also read a bit of Rumi earlier this afternoon, and read a little bit right now.  I'll post up some of his awesome mystic poetry when I'm not half asleep.  I'm tired now.  And I miss you JL.  Ok, bye.

      Well, I attempted to remedy the whole chemistry situation today.  In the process, I got in a yelling match with my professor in class because he was wrong on quite a few answers, and refused to look at the answers I was presenting.  I didn't know that something with a pH of 7 is considered a basic solution.  Another student in the class walked out after another yelling match.  Very interesting day indeed.  Oh yeah, JL...smile!

      It's the weekend after the storm as we say around here.  I didn't do much yesterday other than relax a bit during the day, and catch up on emails and writing a huge email to everyone.  Yesterday night I went over to Nitin's house to have dinner which he cooked!  Nitin is quite the Chef!  I think he made "buryani" and some chicken.  It tasted awesome, and yes, it did remind me of home.  I'll have to learn how to cook something nice when I go back home.  My roommate is still in St. Kitts.  They didn't seem to come home last night - I guess they had toooo much fun at the music festival.  Hrm, now I have to figure out how I can call home...  Ok, be back later.

      It's midnight, and here I am a little tired from studying so much.  I've been at this since about 4pm this afternoon, and I still feel that I don't have enough time to learn all this!  I'll be fine, I think!  Well, I also got my plane tickets today...and now, $973USD later, I'll be back in Mississauga on Friday, August 13th at 4:43pm!!  So mark that down on your calendars folks!  Just kidding.  We had an interesting second hour during neuro today.  Our professor gave us a mock clinical question which pretty much incorporated everything that we've learned throughout the semester thus far.  We had to work in groups, and let's just say that my group had a rather comical member ;)  Let's put it this way, when our professor asked us to present the case, they said, "this patient has cerebellar damage because the occulomotor nerve comes out of the cortex..."  We're sitting there dumbfounded!!  Maybe you're thinking that this was an honest[sic] mistake, but noooo....this same person asked the other day during lab, "Excuse me Dr. D, where are the suture's on the brain?"  I mean, you don't even have to know much about medicine to know that a suture is between BONES!!  Ack!!  Ok, now back to the wonderful world of neuro.  JL, I hope you're doing well btw!  Byee.

      It's about 1:30am, and I'm just finishing off studying for neuro tonight.  Very long day today. All I'm thinking at this point is ventricles, midbrain, pons, medulla, cranial nerves, lesions, and so forth.    I went to see my new place today, and omg, it is huge!!  We have an insane view over the Four Season's resort and golf club.  And it's in an incredibly rich neighbourhood which is a very good thing around here.  I'd even care to venture that my new place is bigger than Nitin's house!!  And by December, we'll have a swimming pool!!  Hahaha!  JL, you're coming ok?  Good :)  38 days and counting...and block exams on Friday, ack!!  Ok, time for bed...zzzzzzzz.

      Today was a rather entertaining day.&nbsp; Chemistry class starts off this morning with a power outage due to some torrential downpour of rain!&nbsp; We then had to move to the library to finish off the last hour or so of class.&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  What's actually really funny in chemistry is this one girl in our class who seems to think she knows everything that's going on, while trying to make it obvious at the same time.&nbsp; It's funny how she has her "Mickey Mouse" organic chemistry textbook from the U.S. in her hands while she tries to correct the professor all the time.&nbsp; She's also proud that she comes from the ghetto part of NY, and actually gloats that where she's from has a high murder and crime rate, lol.&nbsp; Her brother is also here on vacation and has probably burned enough already that he probably doesn't even know where he is!&nbsp; He's also 18 and thinks he's a thug!&nbsp; Ok, enough crazy people commentary for the evening.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  This afternoon, I went with Sirhan and Rajan to pay the deposit for our house...$1350 USD/month!&nbsp; Lotsa money, but it's a great place.&nbsp; And we're getting a pool by December! :)&nbsp; &nbsp;  Here's something I wrote.&nbsp; Ya right.&nbsp; It's my favorite Sufi mystical poet Rumi...enjoy :) &nbsp; "In my hallucination,  I saw my beloved's flower garden,  In my vertigo,  In my dizziness,  In my drunken haze,  Whirling and dancing like a spinning wheel..." &nbsp; Bye bye. &nbsp; P.S. JL, if you're reading this, I miss you!&nbsp; Also, you're the best!&nbsp;

      I'm bored, so just some social commentary from an email forward tonight ;)  The "Away" Person -  This person is either saying “Hi I’m never here but I leave my MSN on in the hope that SOMEONE will message me while I’m out so I feel important" or they’re saying "I’m here but I only want to talk to a privileged few people while everyone else thinks I’m NOT here".   To this person I ask:  Why are you a) so shallow or b) such a dick?     The "Away" Person part II-  This person signs in and immediately switches their status to "Away" EVERY time. To this person I ask: why do you sign into a chat program designed to talk to your friends only to walk away from your computer as soon as you sign in? Either you’re incredibly retarded and entirely miss the concept of internet instant messaging or you are a huge asshole because you think you are too good to talk to anyone.   The "Busy" person -  This person has his/her status set to "Busy" more often than not and when you try to talk to them they either don't respond or tell you that they’re “working on an essay/project/assignment” or whatever.   To this person I ask: If you are too busy to talk on MSN then why are you signed in? The function of MSN IS TO CHAT with your friends....there is no other excuse to have it on because it serves no other purpose....so what you're really saying is not that you are "too busy to talk" it's that you are "too busy to talk to ME or anyone else but a select few people who you deem privileged enough"...otherwise you'd shut it off so that you could do your work. If that’s the case then tell me and I'll understand which is much better than the insinuation that you think I'm too retarded to see that you have a "cool list" that I'm apparently not on.   The "Multiple sign inner" -  This person signs in ever two seconds because of computer difficulties. GET IT FIXED...it’s fucking annoying.   The "Frequent Name Changer" -  I can see changing your name to something cool when you hear it or when something truly cool happens to you; but when every three minutes you’re changing your name during every song you hear on your 500 song Winamp play list to some “deep” lyric is also really fucking annoying     The "Chronic Complainer" -  If you escape death in a car wreck, or overcome some scary disease or have a wicked story then I probably want to hear about it. If you have too much homework and the sniffles and change your MSN name to whatever daily complaint you have, you can go fuck yourself.  If it’s winter in Canada it is likely that A LOT of people are sick and most with worse shit than you're complaining about. People with cancer would give their right arms to have whatever you're bitching about instead of what they have....and if you go to school and you ave too much work or just pulled and all nighter, BIG FUCKING DEAL...EVERYONE has homework and EVERYONE has had to do an all nighter at some point. These people I also call "Sympathy Fishermen" because they complain about everything so someone will say "ooh you poor thing how DO you mange to get by?" SUCK IT UP.  The only people I'd ask that question to are people fighting cancer or starvation in 3rd world countries or kids who get every limb blown off by bombs in war torn countries; NOT you and your curable ailment...fuckin pussy     The "Vanishing Person" -  This complaint is NA if the person is drunk or stoned. If you talk to someone who is drunk and stoned this is to be expected...this person gets up from their computer in mid conversation and forgets about you....to this person I say: Get some manners and at least end the conversation or tell them that you will be back...I mean this is like putting the phone down in mid conversation and going to take a shit without saying anything. Where did you people grow up?   The "Grammar Police" -  This person feels the need to not only correct each spelling mistake they make but to make fun of yours as well....fuck I didn't realize I was writing an essay here, if you know what I mean then stop being a first class loser and grow the fuck up. If you feel like correcting every errant letter you write that’s your perogative but holy shit calm the fuck down when I do it.   This is all I can think of tonight but others include people who use way too many abbreviations. Like, ttyl, lol, and lmfao are legit but when you start getting into shit like hsiadaf to say "holy shit I am as drunk as fuck" and expect people to know what you’re saying you’re just weird....anyway, I started this but I bet it's nowhere near finished so feel free to add to it and send it off....

      This is actually the third time that I've been trying to write something in here since Friday!  I opened up this page Friday night, and Saturday night, and I kept on telling myself that I'd write something, but I didn't really feel in a writing mood.  Now I am.  So here's the story from A to Z.  Friday's rounds of exams were probably the weirdest yet.  I managed to do marginally better in the classes that I neglected.  And I also managed to possibly get screwed in neuro.  Not screwed per se, but I don't think I managed to get a high A.  Oh well.  Competition is on though, time to put the NY'ers in their place, lol.  It's friendly, don't worry about it ;)  My roommate and the guys all went to St. Maarten again!  I don't think these guys know when to stop partying!  If only I could write about all the crazy things they did there, lol.  I, however, was at Nitin's house for practically all of Saturday.  Nitin and I were the chef's for the evening.  We cooked some chicken wings, potatoes and some mushroom thing (Nitin's idea) for everyone (Dan, Dave, Nick, Chelsee, Nitin and I).  We then watched Spiderman 2!!  What a fantastic movie!  See it! :)  After the movie, I had a wonderful realization.  I noticed that my wallet was missing!  We scoured Nitin's house to no avail, as well as his car and surrounding areas.  Nothing.  Then, I decided to just go back to the dorms to see if the night watchman was out and hopefully let me into my room.  Luckily, he was, though when I got back to my room, my wallet was not on my desk!  It wasn't on my bed, and wasn't in any of my pockets.  At this point, I'm sweating and pretty much freaking out.  This is the last place in the world that a person would want to be without all their important cards.  Then, as I'm walking out, I had a feeling (psychosis?) telling me to go back and look at my roommates desk.  Lo and behold, my wallet! Woot!  So here's what happened.  When Nitin picked me up in the morning, he asked for a drink as we were leaving (and my wallet was in my hand).  What I did is that I set it down on my roommate's desk, grabbed his drink and walked out.  It didn't even cross my mind that I had forgotten it as I had just had it in my hands minutes earlier, and didn't even think about it until I was about to go home.  So lesson of the day, aside from not being stupid like me, don't forget your wallet anywhere ;)  Today was pretty much uneventful.  When the guys got back from St. Maarten, we headed over to Sunshine's for some dinner.  When we got there, I saw for the first time, what I have never ever seen on Nevis before.  Yes, I saw a hot looking woman, lol.  I'm sorry, I know, I know, but sights like that around here are quite rare!  Anyhow, as luck would have it, they were only serving drinks, and the kitchen was closed for the evening.  It's ok though, we anticipated it anyhow, so we went over to Mem's Pizza and I had a large pizza to myself.  Ok, you're asking how I could eat a large pizza.  It wasn't really "large".  A "large" pizza around here is about the size, if not smaller than a "small" pizza back home ;)  Well, that's about it for now.  31 days till I'm back in T.O.!  And I still miss you JL!  Ok, bye bye bye.

      Wow!&nbsp;&nbsp; This Friday's block of exams were really brutal...but they were also fun!!&nbsp; So what's so fun about neurology?&nbsp; Well, let me tell you.&nbsp; Once you're actually done the anatomy, the clinical applications are fun!&nbsp; I don't care that it takes a couple of minutes to read a question and come up with an answer at all because at least all the material is coming together.&nbsp; I'm sure gross anatomy is helpful (yes, I'm being sarcastic), but I like this material a lot more :)   Anyhow, exams did go quite well in the end.&nbsp; Again, I pulled some high A's, so that's all fine and dandy.   Here's an awesome clinical example:   "A 50 year old male patient comes into your office and tells you the following: "Last night, my left leg felt weak all of a sudden and as I&nbsp;attempted to walk to the kitchen, it seemed as though the leg was buckling underneath me.&nbsp; I reached out to the table with my left hand to support myself and noticed that I had lost strength there too.&nbsp; I sat down&nbsp;as I was feeling both&nbsp;dizzy&nbsp;and tired.&nbsp; I took two ibuprofen and went to bed.&nbsp; The next morning, I tried to wash my face, but couldn't tell if the tap water was hot or cold with my left hand, but could notice that it was hot with my right hand.&nbsp; I then noticed that my right eyelid seemed all droopy, and was having double-vision.&nbsp; What is wrong with me?"   Try and figure it out if you can :)&nbsp; Gmail account for&nbsp;the first person with&nbsp;the right answer!   Anyhow, I'll be back later.&nbsp; I'm going over to Jaime's house to prepare some food for a party tonight.

      First and foremost, Picasa rocks!!&nbsp; Picasa is Google's new photo organization tool, and is the Google of photo software.&nbsp; I've always been envious of Apple's iPhoto software, but this thing is comparable, if not better!&nbsp; So go and grab it over at:  urlLink http://www.picasa.com/google/?promo=hpp1   &nbsp;  You can thank me later ;)  &nbsp;  Soooo....what else is new?&nbsp; Well, I've been studying quite a bit of neurology this weekend, and am getting close to putting most of this stuff all together.&nbsp; And I've been thinking lately, as I've been doing more and more neurology this semester, I'm actually considering it as a career now.&nbsp; I'm not sure if I'm smart enough to become a neurosurgeon, but I think I can get into Internal Medicine, and specialize in neurology if anything.&nbsp; Bah, who knows what will happen.  &nbsp;  Ok, that's all for now folks.&nbsp; Bye bye.  &nbsp;  P.S. JL...guess who has a Gmail account now!? ;)

      I guess no one has come up with a solution to that clinical problem so far?&nbsp; Hint, start off with motor deficiencies and then go onto sensory.&nbsp; Then see if it is Upper or Lower Motor Neuron damage.   Anyhow, that's that.&nbsp; I had a brutal day of classes today.&nbsp; 8-10am chem, 10-12pm med term, 1-3pm neuro, and 3-5pm, more chem!&nbsp; By the time I got home, taken a shower, eaten, and taken a nap, it was 8pm.&nbsp; Then I had to goto my landlord's house to get our cable internet set up.&nbsp; When all that was done and when I got back into my room,&nbsp;there were 6 people in here waiting for my triumphant return to copy my organic homework - which I had&nbsp;yet to start at that point!   I'm only done about half of it as I write this....argh.&nbsp;   How about a little humor for the&nbsp;rest of the night?&nbsp; I'm sure I've mentioned the really cocky NY'er in my class who thinks she's the shit.&nbsp; Well, she and her comrades failed neuro on Friday ;)&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;Because&nbsp;we actually had to think on this exam! lol   There's what, 16 days left now?! Wooo hooo!

      I'm bored.&nbsp; Here's some interesting statistics about what I should anticipate during residency:   Average Starting Age of Residents: 26.5  Average Length of Residency: four years  Average Hours Per Week: 80  Average Educational Debt: $100,000  Average Salary Range: $38,500-49,000   Average Length of Training:  Pediatrics — three years  Internal Medicine — four years  General Surgery — five years  Otolaryngology (Head/Neck) — six years  Neurosurgery — seven years   And yes, at this point, I'm considering neurosurgery! Ack!

      The party this evening was pretty nice.&nbsp; We just chilled and had some good food :)   Later on this evening, however, was absolutely crazy!!!&nbsp; The power was out all around the island!!&nbsp; And considering that electrical stuff around here is crap, it was not surprising.&nbsp; The rain didn't stop pouring for hours and hours.&nbsp; Wonderful huh?   Thomas, aka: Tom-bosis, is over right now describing some "wonderful" things he did when he was working in a spinal cord injury clinic.&nbsp; These are stories to hear in person ;)   Anyhow, I guess no one has come up with an answer to the question I posted in that previous post.&nbsp; Here's another link to try out some (very easy) forensic examination questions:  urlLink http://health.discovery.com/fansites/drg/quiz/quiz.html    Enjoy!&nbsp;   P.S. JL......boooooooo!&nbsp; You know why :(&nbsp; j/k
