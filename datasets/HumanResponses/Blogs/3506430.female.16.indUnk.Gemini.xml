      ["Why good morning, Liz!" he said, addressing his reflection. "Aren't you as beautiful as a country farm in the summertime, only you don't smell as bad!" Garfield sat up and cocked his head. "No, no-that's not it," thought Jon out loud.  No kidding, Romeo. Try again.  "How about 'Your eyes shine like oil sticks on a dew-sprinkled country road'?" Garfield signed heavily and his fur stuck out on end. Jon leaned into the mirror, fluttered his eyebrows, and crooned. "You know, if we cut off your arms, you'd look just like the Venus de Milo!" Garfield started to howl and writhe on the floor. "Goodness, Garfield, are you okay?"] from Garfield The Movie by H.S.Newcomb This book is sooo funny, it doesn't make you think, you just read and entertain yourself, a perfect summer book  Yesterday me and Sasha went to the beach, the water's still cold, so we didn't swim for long. Even though there wasn't a lot of sun, I still got burnt. It hurts now, but oh well, it's my own fault, should've been more careful. We tried to play a little volleyball, but there was no net and lots of wind. then we just walked around Astroland. They got a few new rides this year. Sasha loved the park, cause it was her first time there. I wasn't that thrilled, I mean compared to all the other parks I've been to in Florida, Cali and France, Astroland doesn't look that exciting. And plus I've lived next to it for 3 years, don't mean to be picky, but they should definetely renovate it or smth.  On Saturday we went to Times Square. I saw such a cute stuffed doggie in Toys'R'Us, it was the size of half of my bed and cost only $50. Hmm, it would be just perfect for my new room. Imma definetely spend some money decorating it. Oh, and I have to buy a gift for my mom's bday, it's in 2 weeks, I haven't decided yet what I'll buy.  Tomorrow I have a full day working, and wednesday I start my first day of ice skating. Yep, very exciting.   Gelau vsem udachnoi nedeli!

      It's raining.. strange, but reminds me of my first love, the one that still refuses to let go and leave my heart.. and I loved him and hated him and .. loved him again, still do  yesterday John came to the library with some girl, he's showing off and he's making it so obvious, doesn't he realize how foolish he looks, how desparate he's making himself be, and I'm sure that he is making himself be like that, why can't he be a man and respect the choice that I made, if he cared he would honestly, it's like 5th grade, bringing another girl to the place where I work at [and he hasn't ever done it before] after I told him I'm over him, does he really think that I'm not smart enough to see what's going on, I've been there before and it's just sad, I'm losing all respect I ever had for him, and respect does mean a lot to me  last day of school, I feel so relieved, got my grades, 84.93 average [awesome] =P, 77 for chem regents, I'll live, I was afraid I failed, was gonna hang out with Sasha after work, but it rained tomorrow no work!!! lol feel like I should celebrate my first free Saturday in a loooong time, if the weather is good, will go to the beach with Sasha and maybe Mariyna, but she has to pack so I dunno if she'll go, Imma miss her, even though she'll be back on July 15th, that's a long time still  There was sooooo much food in the library today, but it was really tasty, and I forgot to take the boxes again, I should be packing my stuff too, so sick of it though, I didn't even know I had so much stuff I don't need, and I have to sort it all out, and it's just taking so much energy  Haben Sie ein gutes Wochenende

      It doesn't hurt as much when someone you love is crying as when you know that there's nothing you can do to make things right.. parents fighting.. not the best time of my life, not like I should be surprised, I should be already used to it, but nothing's gonna change, so what am I to do?

      Took my last regents for this year today!!! whew =] I don't feel so confident about it though, chem is not my thing, but I've outdone my best expectations for global-92. Damn, and that's after all the tests and quizes I failed in Arcuri's class.   The last few days I've been spending lots of time packing. I'm moving, I haven't seen the apartment yet, but dad said I'll have my own room. That's awesome!!! You should see my place though right now, it feels so empty and there are all these boxes... I'm very excited about moving, I can't stand living in one place for a long time, which haven't really ever happened, since we've never lived in one place for more than 4 years or so. At least I had no choice but to clean out all the junk I have from school, I would've never gotten to it otherwise.  On monday Misha went with me to Chelsea Piers. I signed up for ice skating. Since I have time now to do something I want, I want to learn to ice skate. The timing is perfect, even though summer doesn't really connect with ice skating. That's what Sasha tried to tell me, saying how I gotta be going to the beach more and how I don't need ice skating cause I got work. But when else will I get to do it, if not now? Junior year [don't even like to think about it] is gonna be crazy, and I don't want to quit my job, and I'm gonna be doing dance like always.   Speaking about the beach, the water's still cold, honestly!!! lol But I promise I'll go soon.  I was thinking of some songs to choreograph to, but there're so many to choose from. So far I got "Dreams" by All Saints, "Love Me Right" by Angel City, "2000 Let" my Demo or "I Believe" from Honey Soundtrack as my choices.  I've been reading a lot lately. Weird, right? You can't make me read 2 pages in a textbook, but when I get to the library or Barnes and Noble, I can spend the whole day there. I brought some [some is around 50 =P ] video tapes to the library that I don't need, put them out at the end of the day, they looked so pretty, titles on colored paper, cause I didn't have the cases.  Oh and yeah, this is about finally finishing something I should've done long ago. I told John I don't like him anymore. Seems easy, but it was hard to do for me. Maybe I'm still confused, but not as much as I was, and it felt like weight has been lifted once I got it over with. I didn't get a chance to say all I wanted to, cause I was at work, and the words kinda came outa my mouth so fast. He didn't stay for long or try to change my mind, which I actually expected from him, so I was surprised. He stormed out of the library. I really don't get boys. Last summer he told me he got himself a new girl, dunno what happened to her, cause he never mentioned her again. Yeah, I did suspect that he lied, but I didn't want to get into it, and I think I better not know. I'm not sure if I should even talk about this here, but I want to get it out of my head. After I told him, he said that he was gonna tell me the same. Gosh, why do I feel like it ain't true? Why didn't he tell me the truth then, not then, not anytime before. Am I that intimidating? Was I acting the wrong way, that he's just being so not real? And why does it have to my fault anyway? No, I will stop thinking that I did something wrong, cause it's over and done now, and maybe it should stay this way.  Well, till next time I get my computer to work or whenever I feel like writting... MwaZz

       "She'd thrown her husband out three years after they married, for carousing. "You put his brain in a bird, the bird would fly backward,"she liked to say. I often wondered what that bird would do with Rosaleen's brain. I decided half the time it would drop shit on your head and the other half it would sit on abandoned nests with its wings spread wide." from "The Secret Life of Bees" by Sue Monk Kidd  I'm a loser, lol, a determined one, but still a loser. I do take things too seriously and often seem to overreact, but that's just the way I am. One thing that I hate is people taking my stuff without asking. Seriously, what's up with that?! What's a simple "Can I use this?" gonna hurt? I almost always will say "yes". I would never take someone's things whne I know who they belong to without asking. I expect the same in return. Tuesday I worked from 12 to 8. It was ok. Some girl kept following me around, which was really weird. Turned out she wanted to know Randalls name. It was so funny. But I'm not anybodies "messanger girl". Common, just go ask him urself, what do I have to do with it. Library is so full of surprises. And it's good, cause these things that make me laugh are what keeps me having a positive attitude. Sometimes I just want to hit some of these people on the head, cause they're just so annoying and mad for no reason at all. But it definetely easier to deal with this wanting by just smiling and making fun of it. Yesterday I worked from 10 to 6. It wasn't busy, which was good. After that I went to Chelse Piers for my first ice skating lesson. It was so awesome!! I loved it, even though I was really bad at it. But hey, it was the first time I put on ice skates in 8-9 years. Gotta give myself some credit for that, don't I? I was late though, took the B, instead of the Q, cause I didn't want to be late, but I forgot that B skips 23rd street. So stupid, had to transfer and go back. There goes my being on time. I had lots of fun nonetheless. Gotta learn to stop looking down when I'm skating and stop moving my hands. I'll get it eventually. After the lesson, I bought my own skates on my own money. Great! They're just regular white ones, but pretty. I've felt really good after that evening. I left at around 9pm. There were lots of people waiting on a line. I guess for some city tour or something like that. It should be interesting, so I might go there once, maybe when Mariyna comes back. I'm sure she'll be interested. I miss my cuz lots. It's really nice how she's my cuz and my best friend.  Ydachnogo chetverga vsem!!!
