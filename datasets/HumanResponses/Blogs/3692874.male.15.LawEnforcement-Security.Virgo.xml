      Freedom... not as in being a freeman, not as in i am free to go anywhere and also not as in doing whatever i want... freedom to me is the 3simple letter word... Joy... so simple to spell so simple to say and yet is so tough to have it in Singapore... "I want a life of my own... i am jason ang... no more" those who can bring joy to me of cause goes to my girl and brothers and sisters... they are my life most important beings... my family? hahaha... not as much as them... bad boy? no no.. i am stating the fact.. they did bring me joy because if not them i wun be here and smiling everyday...  Messages: Clara:Thanks for the joys you bring to me.. Afraid i might die on the road(u know wad i mean) Brothers:Hahaha... u all shld know ah... hahahaha... other than party whole day wad else? Sisters:Hahhaha... same as on top...

"I believe there is a hero in all of us, give us strength, mades us noble. Even thought we sometimes have to give up the things we want the most"  MJ   :This is funny, I am not sure where to begin... Do you love me? or not? Peter:I....don't MJ   :You don't? .... kiss me Peter:Kiss you? MJ   :I need to know something... Just one kiss  Spiderman2 is a great movie... watching the second time on monday... which means tml... the show is about live, love and action... therefore is a movie that is worth while to watch... my eyes got water when uncle ben spoke to peter in his mind and also the part when peter explain to MJ over a line-less phone... but most importantly, there is loads of meaning and good examples for us to learn from...  After the movie... i went to SunPlaza park to meet clara and jog with her for awhile and then send her home... went to  pasir ris to play sands!!  To: Vincent: Hey brother! hows ur hand going?
