      so what do u call someone who spends all their time on friendster and myspace looking for friends?&nbsp; A BIG FAT LOSER!&nbsp; yup that's me.&nbsp; instead of being social and going out i'm online 24/7 looking for lost friends, relatives, anyone who wants to be my friend.&nbsp; yes i admit it... i got sucked into the whole conspiracy of online friends sites.&nbsp; however, i think this is safer than going to a bar and risking getting drugged by some DOM, or grooped by nasty idiots who think they're all that.&nbsp; can i get an AMEN?

      i shouldn't complain about working on the weekends cuz at least i'm working right?&nbsp; but there's just something not right about having to work the evening shift on the weekends... the day time i wouldn't mind cuz at least u can go out or do something after.&nbsp; getting off at 2 am hungry and wanting to watch a movie or go to a bar but everthings closed really truly sucks!&nbsp; in chicago places closed later so that was never an issue but la really does suck with it's 2 am thingy.&nbsp; now u think someone would dispute this and try to get it extended... i'm wondering if they're just trying to make people go home early so these people who made up this 2 am thing can have their own parties w/o us hard working people!&nbsp; see now i'm just getting paranoid and making up crap!&nbsp; and that's what the night shift can do to ya....

      u think u know, but u really have no idea.  the other day i was reflecting about how well i know my friends and how well my friends know me...  not just friends, people very near to your heart, best friends, confidants.  u think that everything's all good and then one day u find out about something that u never thought could happen.  u start to take yourself out of that box and look from the outside.  u change your perception of that person and start to develope hurt feelings torward them because u felt they violated your much cherished friendship and trust.  u wonder how could this person even do that to u or anyone?  what were they thinking?  do they even care about my feelings?  then u can't understand how they could do anything bad to u or anyone around u.  u start to over analyze and pick at everything that has happen to u w/ this person and u think was this person genuine?  it's funny how someone can get blinded easily and all it takes is one situation to make u look at someone so differently than u did a minute ago.  whether it's in relationships or friendships, it happens everyday.  people get hurt, people fight, people forgive, and people move on.  can it ever be avoided?

      sorry the position has been filled.....  man if i hear that again i'm going postal!  ok now i feel better now that i've said that.  man what does it take to get a decent job these days!  am i wrong for being picky and not wanting to settle for the gap or work at the mall anymore....  i mean i don't look down on those jobs, i did do my time there many years ago.  i just feel like i shouldn't settle for just any job.  this next job has to be something i can commit to for a while, at least 2 years.  plus i wanna go to spain and that keeps getting pushed back the longer i'm without a full time job.  hmmm what to do!

      i finally landed a job in the wonderful city of manhattan, ny!  i design for an accessories company that mostly produces buttons and belt buckles and what not.  it's easy stuff... no brainer actually but it's a paycheck and that satisfies me for now.  i know i won't stay long cuz there's not room to grow here creativly, but it will be good experience.  plus i get time to do my freelance on the side!  life is slowly coming together!

      so i ended up working vday, which was fine cuz i made good money that night.  however, i did get super messed up,  like i never have before and will never do again!  let's just say some herbal got involved in the night, and totally took over me!  besides that my part-time job has served to be a very good source of extra income.  things at my day job are picking up and i haven't been falling asleep at my desk like i was a few weeks ago.  ummmm, lets see... yeah that about it.  i work, i sleep, i chat and sometimes i get a good movie or 2 in, but my life is completely boring right now.  but u know what?  i like it.  i like that i don't have any drama or retarded people making my life miserable!  boring is defiantely an upside.  i'm looking to find more time to do my creative stuff and finish all the projects i started.  k back to pretending to work!

      4:12, monday morning... yes i should be sleeping... i have work in a couple hours.  the whole day i've had a very uneasy, restless, anxious feeling which i think is what is keeping me up.  i mean i'm like wide awake, fully functional, brain goin a 100 miles per hour... or however fast our brain works.  i even got headphones on with slow jams or anything soothing, but it's not working.  i think my worring is getting the best of me.  i'm starting to feel the pressure of this year, how my goals feel so far away, and how my student loans are starting to make me hyperventilate!  i mean i thought college would be worth all the loans i took out, but now i'm not so sure.  i mean i don't even know if i want to be a designer for very long.  art is still my passion, but i'm not sure about graphic design.  it's gotten stale for me.  maybe it's because i'm in the beginning stages of my career, but i know i won't be in this industry for very long.  i'm sorry if i'm always complaining, but this is my only place to vent.  besides all that, the grammys was awesome!  JT, my luvah, was as usual perfect!  i'm so proud to be mrs. timberlake!  i gotta give props to coldplay & outkast.  i was sad, even teary-eyed for luther. he's the man, and i know how it is to have someone close to me suffer and go through a stroke.  i feel for him and his family.

      my mom and sis are visiting me.  i've been working so much that i haven't spent much time with them.  last night i was off and my mom and sis wanted to watch a broadway show.  our first choice was aida but it was sold out so we got tickets to gypsy.  bernadette peters starred in it with jon dosset, the guy who played carrie's politician peeing boyfriend on sex in the city.  i loved it.  the show was simple, the cast was excellent and overall was a great show.  we sat on the left side 2nd floor mezanine which i think were great seats cuz we could see everything, was close but not too far.  i hope it's not the last braoday/off-broadway show i see.  i definately have to see aida, movin out, beauty and the beast, and the producers.

      so my life has come to working like a maniac and trying to fit in any social interaction that i can in any spare time i have.  surprizingly everythings worked out so far and i'm pretty content with my life and the way it's going right now.  i wish i could be laying on a beach somewhere.  it's been snowing for 3 days now.... damit it's supposed to be spring already!!!  man if i didn't have a job here i would be on a plane back home.  yup u heard me!  i would choose the sun over this beautiful city of new york!  so as u can see this entry is something about nothing... just me blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.... i should work don't u think????  booo working!!

      for some reason it's a little nerve rackin making new friends... especially online.  u're not sure what the person is really like and who knows they could totally be frontin... believe me i've seen it happen to my friends.  maybe it's my cynical side kickin in a little.  but at the same time i still contiune to chat w strangers and make light conversation about work, hobbies, etc...   it's a strange thing.  i guess we're all just searching for attention, belonging or just damn bored out of our minds!  anyhow, i've been blessed in meeting cool people... so far... cross my fingers it stays that way!

        it always amazes me who comes out of the wood work after so many years.  so many old friends have been coming out of nowhere.  it's very exciting to see how these people have changed, and not changed.  what puzzles me is why all at the same time?  lately i've been bombarded with the discovery of so many old friends that i don't have enough to entertain it all.  i would love to spend time with each and every one of them, but that's obviously not possible.     sad to say it, but hopefully some will phase out and some will stay, and it will all come together.  i mean the new and the old friends.  i'm glad everyone is getting along fine for now.     u know what though... i'm tired of meeting strange guys.  i mean there are some weirdos out there.  i'm strange myself but i have a good front to hide behind!  these guys are straight up twisted!

      yes that's right... conversations with my dad consist of the following: how r u doing? are you eating?  how's work?  do you have a boyfriend yet?  after he's covered that then he proceeds to tell my why i shouldn't wait so long to get married. last time we talked he asked if i was gay because i haven't had a boyfriend in years and all i talked about were my "girlfriends". i proceeded to tell him no, but thanks for asking me straight up. it's interesting in my culture, that if your not married or have a boyfriend by 21, or going to be an old maid or ur gay! on the flip side my mother wants me to find someone because she says if i wait too long, all the men that will be left have too much baggage and all the good men will be taken. i told her then i'd rather be alone! of course that was half meant, but she makes it so important that i have to find someone right now or else my life is over! ok ok i know that they're just looking out for me, but i can't deal w the pressure. i have enough on my plate. to have to include a relationship in my life right now wud be putting a gun to my head!

      i have nothing against people who carry emotional baggage.  i do however get annoyed when they try to put their baggage on u.  i absolutly don't need anymore drama in my life!  i think i could be supportive up to a certain point and then after that, it's just co-dependancy.  i also can't understand people who front.  what is that all about?  i mean u look like an idiot when people find out the truth about u.  most people stay friends w people who front, so do these people continue to front if their friends already know the truth?  it's a mystery...  it's funny how it's easier for me to blg here then at wordsbypie.  i just can't get myself to go there.  it's such a hassle i think.  i'm so used to checking myspace & friendster.  maybe i should just cancel it.

      yay my first beach trip to long beach in long island!  sunday was just amazing!  the weather was great, the company was awesome... i couldn't have ask for a better sunday off.  people watching is always the best part of the beach.  it's interesting to see all the different people on the beach and their quicky sunbathing habits.  we saw a group of old ladies, who were completely toasted with bleach blonde hair and were passed out on their chairs, hoping for a better tan????  we couldn't understand it.  they looked like burnt toast with a little ball of butter for hair!  on the other side of us was a guy who was trying so hard to hit on these 2 asian women who just wanted to be left alone!  needless to say they left early and the guy was still white as hell... i guess he repels the sun??  anyways, other than that most of the people were super chill.  thanks to our beer nazi, we all got nicely buzzed on the beach, which resulted in a few great laughs!  check out the pics...

       for one moment can i be completely and utterly happy?  content?  satisfied?  is that possible?  i just want to feel the bliss i once felt when life was so much simpler... i'm talking about high school.  even then there was drama now and then, but nothing i couldn't handle.  decisions were easy and much less things to worry about.  i just wish...

       same shit, different day.  routine sucks.  i am so A.D.D. right now.  i haven't been productive for the past few months at work.  i'm so distracted and unmovtivated.  i hate that i sit at this desk all day long w no people interaction.  who brainwashed me at school that this would be a great job?  maybe if i was in a different industry.... nah it would be the same.  neverending crap!   graphic artist??   more like production artist!!!  there is no way any of this work can go into my portfolio.  so discouraging... i need a change... a distraction... a reason to continue...

        venting again:       why must it always be like this?  guys complain that girls always want the assholes... but don't guys want the bitches?  i'm complaining because i am a drama-free girl.  not high maintanance, likes to have fun, can chill with the boys or anyone, not bitchy... except for that time of the month (but who isn't?)... i just wanna have a good time all the time and yet guys only look at me like that and never consider me "girlfriend" material!!!  i mean how does that make any sense?  wouldn't things be so much easier getting w a girl w no baggage?  don't get me wrong i got my issues like the next girl but nothing that would make a relationship intolerable.  i wonder that if guys think like this do i really want to be in a relationship??  of course at the same time i get lonely...  all i ask for is someone to laugh w and enjoy life... absolutely no drama...  is that asking too much?  maybe some guys think that's boring??  i've been hearing that i'm not chasable??  like there's no game w me.  games suck!  who wants that?  apperantly guys like the game.  i'm so confused.     how about living life the easy way... relationships that are simple.  full of love, romance, laughter, and good times.  com'n people let's get it together!  get over yourselves!  we all want is to love and be loved damit!

      let's address my career and stop messin around with all these damn useless and time consuming info that i post everyday!  i really want to leave my job.  both of them.  although i love working at my restaurant job to death and wouldn't trade the people i work with for anything, i have to stop living in my fantasy world and start living down on earth with the rest of the humans.  i can't keep up this schedule either because it's taking a toll on me.  i think i actually see wrinkles forming on my face.  i'm filipino!  i'm not supposed to age till i'm 90!  i have to say that my complexion has gotten amazing in the past year though... anyways, my point is this job is not going to bring me to the next level in my career so i must make a change and make it fast before i lose all interest in the design world.  i need people, and damit people need me!!  i love just talking and talking and talking aimlessly about, well nothing.  just seeing peoples facial reactions to the things i say is rewarding, especially when they look lost and want to walk away.  that's the best reaction!  so i'm thinking since i'm taking a 2 week trip in september, i should give notice to my work that i'm leaving then so that when i return i can start looking for work and will have time to work on my portfolio.  that's what makes sense in my head right now, but i don't know if it will be a good time considering the election is in november.  depending on what goes down will gage how the job market will be.  for me to take that risk is probably not advisable.  i would still work at the restaurant to keep me afloat so i wouldn't be totally unemployed but it will be tight. hmmmmm must think of more solutions!  i'm planning to register to vote for the first time this year.  i'm so lame when it comes to politics.  my friends have been encouraging me to pick a party and vote... mostly the ones who are democrats.  even the republican ones tell me they don't like bush but still tell me that i should vote.  so now i'm kinda thrown into this election clueless and confused.  maybe i should have payed attention to what was going on since last year but i had other priorities like my career to worry about.  so now at the tail end of this election year i'm rushed to figure out what issues i am for and against.  so far i'm leaning torwards the democratic views, however it's still up in the air.  man who knew that one day i'd actually want to become a participating citizen of this country!

      i have no idea what to say.&nbsp; i don't know where to begin.&nbsp; much has been goin on and there is lots to write about.&nbsp; yet i can't collect my thoughts...  rutt - is that 2 t's or 1?&nbsp; i think that can describe my feelings right now.&nbsp; with my love life ( non-existent by the way ) and work.&nbsp; i'm not content but at the same time i don't know where to go.&nbsp; i don't want to dive head first anymore and make irrational decisions.&nbsp; been there done that.&nbsp; and yet i need progress.&nbsp; i need to feel like i'm growing.  i've also abandoned my spiritual life... again... for the n-th time!&nbsp; so many starts but never follow through.&nbsp; i want god in my life and yet, horrible to say he doesn't fit in it.&nbsp; well i mean i don't let him be apart of my life.&nbsp; he probably views me as an idiot who has all the answers to my "problems" waiting at his doorstep and yet i still refuse to choose his door even if i have the freakin key!&nbsp; and no matter what he remains faithful.&nbsp; since moving here i've never been broke.&nbsp; i've even been in abundance quite a few times.&nbsp; no matter how messed up i get, how hard i party, or how dirty my mind and mouth are.... he hasn't left my side.&nbsp; man i'm really blessed and i'm such a bitch for taking it for granted!

      i can't believe half of the year is gone.  it's so crazy that it went by so fast.  so far i'm satisfied with my progress here.  got a job, then another job, then a 2nd job, an apt and an occassional social life!  i wonder what's in store for me next?  i can't wait.  it drives me crazy to find out what's around the corner... waiting... lurking... it makes me uneasy and curious.  i wish i was more motivated at my day job.  i can never make it here on time and when i get here i don't do anything!  there's so much to be done and yet i still choose to blog, take long lunches and chat.  that's awfull i know... and yet i do it again and again.

      i don't know how personal i should get on this thing.  i mean it's one thing to vent and another thing to air your dirty laundry.  but in my state of frustration i'm urged to write.  very hesitant.  ok i shouldn't if i'm doubting myself.  anyways, a sense of loneliness fell upon me this morning.  i miss my family more than ever.  it comes at these random times and when i hits me i get very emotional.  sometimes i wonder if all the hard work here is worth being so far away from them.  in this instance of loneliness i quickly pray for god's comfort.  he's the only one i have that knows how i truely feel.   >>>>HAPPY BIRTHDAY TINA!!!

      i had an interview on thursday that went pretty well.  he sent me home with an assignment and hopefully he likes what i came up with.  i'm anxious to hear what he thinks.  the job is for a fashion graphics position, mostly for screen prints. this position is ideal for me being that i want to start my own business designing t-shirt graphics.  i think if i get the job it will give me a good foundation on the business.  slowly but surely, i'm starting to see another stage of my life unfold.  when i reflect back on my life, i'm so proud of how far i've come.  through all the obstacles, i'm still growing and progressing.  my patience level has gotten better too.

      i don't believe in superstitions but this day is really crappy.  it's almost jinxed (spelling??)  i just feel shitty, everyone is being so demanding, and i have no patience.  i'm trying to be in a good mood but i can't seem to snap out of it.  i even went 4 days without smoking and earlier i broke down and bought another pack.  damit i hate that yucky habit.  maybe i need more sleep.  maybe it's frustration.  maybe it's just me going crazy.  i wish it would go away cuz i hate being like this.  some people out there would probably call this pms... who knows... that part of my life is so irregular.      aaaarrrrrgggggggghhhhhhhhh!!!      i just wanna stand in the middle of central park and scream!  u think they would lock me up or make me leave the park if i did?  i think today is bus day.  i have no patience for the subway right now.

      being honest is probably one of the hardest things to do, especially when it comes to your friends.  i mean you don't really try to twist the truth, but you do change the way you say things so you won't hurt their feelings.  i've recently encountered a situation in my life where i can be completely honest.  it's actually quite liberating. nerve racking, but in a good way.  like i know i can say anything, whether it's good or bad and know that i won't get into shit for it.  i think if i can carry this into every aspect of my life, even with myself, then i'd be much happier.  of course some things will hurt, but i'm a believer in wanting to know rather than not wanting to be aware of things.  then again i think some people, no matter how much it is brought to their attention are still unaware of what they do.  in all this gibber jabber, what i'm trying to say is that it's all a game.  i despise games.  some people say it makes life more interesting... makes the chase more exciting.  i think it's a waste of time.  i also think someone always gets hurt in the end.  there is no good outcome with games.  if there is prove me wrong!

      my love for design is slowly fading away.  i am still interested in the visual arts just not graphic design.  it's a hoax... my work in school is ten times better than what i produce now as a designer.  i don't feel like one actually... more like production artist.  this isn't an art either.  it's cutting photos, scanning, printing... no creativity involved at all.  it's depressing really.  i have so many ideas to start my own business but no money.  i know i have to take a risk and just do it, but i also have to pay rent!  i wish life was not about money.  wouldn't it be great if we could get by bartering things?  i mean most women get sick of the stuff they have especially clothes that i'm sure they would be more than willing to trade off things.  i would barter for my artist abilities.  "hey lemme have free bagels for a year for a logo design and website!"  wouldn't that be awesome?  i think people take for granted what designers do.  they want to pay you $100 for a logo that will generate a million times more profit than what they paid.  great example the nike logo.  a school in seattle had a logo contest for a new up and coming shoe company.  some kid drew the swish logo.  he won and they paid him $100.  inturn he had to give up all the rights to nike for them to use it.  now the multi-billion dollar company is only known for that swish and the guy who designed it is probably still out there struggling with his one hit wonder!  sucks!

      woohoo comments are up and running!  thanks blogger guys!  went to the doctor today for a yearly visit... i gained 4 pounds!  so sad... in 10 days no less... it's all roy's fault.  we ate out everyday!  it's so gross that i could eat 4 pounds of crap in 10 days!  besides the weight gain everything else is good and normal.. at least till the tests come back.  i got another call for an interview thursday.  i'm excited.  i think it's for a fashion graphics position which i've done before and i think would be really cool.  i enjoyed that job i had, if only i got paid for it.  hopefully this one won't be so shady.  alot of my friends have are having babies.  this past year alone i think about 4 people i know had babies.  2 discovered they are pregnant.  it makes me wonder if i'll ever have kids.  i say that i don't want any... at least for now.  i mean these people never planned on it either and now look they're parents.  in most cases all of them have said it's been a life changing experience.  i can only imagine.  i keep thinking to myself, i can't even get my life straight, what more another persons?? i guess it's all in god's time.  i think he knows when a person can handle having a kid and when they still need to grow up.  {{pray for jason ivler please}}

      roy is leaving today.  we had a productive and fun week together.  we went places that i never been too so it was cool for me too.  i was his personal photographer the whole trip.  i wish i could have had more time to spend with him... damn work!  he says the next time he visits will be when he moves here.  that would be so cool to have L.A. friends move here.  i love where i live.  it's so cute.  kinda hectic at times but always something to do.  shanti, gigi and i are always throwin up signs for the upper west side with our hands like retards.  it's silly but we just have so much fun there.  it's really a great home.  i'm going to practice some self control and save some money this month by not going out too much.  i need money for my trip in september.  i don't have nearly enough for it and i'm worried.  hopefully things at the restaurant will pick up and i can have some extra cash before i leave.  hawaii is going to be a blast!  i plan to do absolutly nothing while i'm there.  that's my ideal vacation.   &nbsp;

      ever been at a time in your life where you know you need to make a change at that moment or else you might never have a chance again??  that is how i feel right now.  i feel like time is waiting on me to make a move...  i wanna bust out on my own and start a business, travel, learn a new language, etc... what's stopping me?  frustration is definately something i feel everyday and it won't go away until i make my move.  i need help.

      G: "Would you be arrogant if you were really rich?" S: "I’m already arrogant"  R: "I love you but I’m not touching your bunghole."  G: "I thought Harold and Kumar was that stupid movie with the tigers..."  An hour later… S: "But why would the tigers be going to White Castle?"  S: "Is there semen on your bed?" R: "No man, I swallowed that shit!"  Sh: "I just want to lick you all over."  S: "Yo mamma pangit!"  "Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalm!!!"  "Ah-ne-BODA!"  I: "I got my own tools. Whatever you need, just let me know. I got my own tools."
