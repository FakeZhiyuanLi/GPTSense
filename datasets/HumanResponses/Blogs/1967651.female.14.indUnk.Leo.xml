      Today was not a good day.  I forgot my stuff for gym (swimsuit, towel, etc.) AND my gym uniform, so I had to do stairs in a sweater and jeans. It is HOT up there!!! And boring!!! Plus, I can't make it up because I didn't have my uniform? Thats the DUMBEST rule I've ever heard!!!  Then I checked the call-back list for the play and I didn't make it. Not that I expected to (I'm just a freshman) but of COURSE Julie (this girl I don't like) made it. And all my guy-friends. Jeez.  Now I have to finish this assignment my psycho Bio teacher assigned (100 questions about the digstive and excetory systems). And my grandparents are coming over for dinner. I love my grandparents, but that kind of slows things down, gives me less time for stuff I want to do.  @U$#@(*#&@#(*&#!!!!

      I had the weirdest dream last night.  Recently, I've been having Lord of the Rings-related dreams, all of them odd, but this one was way odd.  I dreamt that I was a female version of Pippin and that I was in the midst of the battle of the Pelennor fields. But it wasn't the Pelennor fields that the world is now familiar with. It was the main gym at my school, but instead of the bleachers on one of the sides, there was a stage, where everybody was fighting.  I remember trying to look for Gandalf. I ran out of the door, but instead of walking into the hallways of my school, I ran into a maze of white hallways.  Weird, huh?  Yeah, and like a week or so ago I had a different LOTR themed dream. I was on a white couch in an old library (like the kind you'd see in turn of the century mansions). Behind the couch was a door. It opens, and out come these Gollum clones.  That's right. Gollum clones.  Weirder still, they were chanting "We wants it" (exactly like he said it in Two Towers when he was talking to himself the first time) and they surrounded the couch. Then something happened (I think I screamed) and they disappeared. I got off the couch, and looked behind me. There's this HUGE Gollum standing there with this inflated head! I turn to my right, and there's Marianne (a classmate) with a video camera, looking terrified.  I think I'm losing it...

        Your ideal Middle-Earth parents are Aragorn and Arwen!  They are the king and queen of Gondor, which makes you a prince or princess.  Not too shabby, huh?  Youll get to take over the kingdom someday.  Look at you, all heir-to-the-throne-y!  Oh, did I mention that you are gorgeous?  Your Middle-Earth mama is practically a supermodel, while your Middle-Earth dad managed to turn heads at eighty-seven years old.  Youve hit the genetic lottery, my friend!  Your last name is Telcontar and you live in the city of Minas Tirith.  Your Middle-Earth mama is Arwen Undomiel.  She is an elf but gave up her immortality to be with your dad.  If you do something bad she will probably lower her head in sorrow and shed a tear or two, which, although it may not be her intention, is major guilt tripping.  Through Arwen you are related to Elrond and Celebrian (your grandfather and grandmother) and Celeborn and Galadriel (your great-grandparents).  She is also a link to your uncles Elladan and Elrohir, who spoil you rotten.  Your Middle-Earth dad is Aragorn.  Since he became king he has been going by King Elessar, but he has a lot of other names too.  He is an amazing warrior and will teach you everything he knows. Some dads play football with their kids - your dad gave you your first sword at the age of three!  Aragorn is the disciplinarian, and since your grandfather Elrond raised him he is very stern when necessary.  Just behave yourself and you should be fine.     urlLink   Which Lord of the Rings couple would be your dream parents? Pictures and longish answers.     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Hey, all, it's Katherine, coming to you live from school! Biology class, to be exact.  And boy, I'm not having fun.  We're on Day 2 of the fetal pig dissection. Yes, fetal pigs. As in, they haven't been born yet.  Gross.  So, on Day 1 of the fetal pig dissection, I took one look at the inside of that thing (the salivary glands), and I couldn't take it. So here I am, in the computer lab, doing a virtual dissection.  I still have to see all the parts, but not live. I guess that makes it a little better.  Ew, ew, ew. I just finished the digestive system, now am on the circulatory. They're separating some of the parts with forks. Oh, the irony.  Oh, my God. "Here is a beef heart with some incisions which will later be opened to show the chambers and valves inside." It looks like an uncooked t-bone steak. I wonder if that's what it is, seeing that it's beef. (They're showing a beef heart because it's bigger than a fetal pig heart.)  Yay, I aced the quiz. Happy happy joy joy. Note the dripping sarcasm.  25 minutes...25 minutes...  Because it's virtual, you don't have to make the incisions (thank God), so I'm half done already. After only half a Bio class!  Wait a second, that gives me a huge advantage. Think about it: I can do this dissection a hundred times if I wanted to, because it's online. Plus, there's a commentary, telling me exactly where is what and what this organ does.  But then again, the operative phrase here is "if I wanted to".

      These are all the stuff in "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Extended Edition" that sound really wrong if you think of them in that way.  FRODO: Don't look down Sam, just keep going! SAM: ...Grab it, Mr. Frodo! SAM: ...it's not natural. None of it. Ok, do you know what that stuff in the box LOOKS LIKE?!?! SAM: Well, who's going to follow us here? SAM: I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way. FRODO: Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it Sam? Any time Gollum mentions his "precious"... GOLLUM: ...and we wants it! GOLLUM: ...Nasty elves... GOLLUM: Take it off us! SAM: It's hopeless! Every orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket! Let's just tie him up... GOLLUM: We be nice to them if they be nice to us...we swears to do what you wants! We swears! ORC: He wants the Shire-rats now! UGULK: Saruman will have his prize... ARAGORN: Their pace is quickened... FREDA: Papa says Eothain is not to ride Garulf. He's to big for him! GRIMA: You see much, Eomer son of Eomund. Too much. LEGOLAS: They run as if the very whips of their master were behind them. ORC: Ooh, they look tasty... ORC: Do they give good sport? ARAGORN: A hobbit lay here...and the other. FRODO: Don't touch me! GOLLUM: So bright. So beautiful. Our precious. Gandalf's lack of clothes and his reaction at being "sent back". GIMLI: That is no short distance! GANDALF: A great power has been sleeping here for many long years. GANDALF: The Ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong. TREEBEARD: Don't be hasty... GANDALF: Everything depends upon speed. FRODO: I do not ask you to come with me, Sam. GOLLUM: There's a path, and some stairs, and then tunnel. PIPPIN: I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby. That whole Merry and Pippin conversation about who's "taller". TREEBEARD: ...Dig deep... TREEBEARD: The trees have grown wild... HAMA: I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. GRIMA: I told you to take the wizard's staff! GANDALF: Your fingers would remember their own strength better if they grasped your sword. GRIMA: I've only ever served you, my lord. GANDALF: Draw him away from your women and children. ARAGORN: You have 2,000 good men riding north as we speak. GANDALF: He will need you before the end, Aragorn. GANDALF: Look to my coming at the first light on the fifth day... SARUMAN: Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety? ARAGORN: (to Eowyn) You have some skill with a blade. Saruman's raised eyebrow when Grima says that "They will have women and children with them." GOLLUM: They are young, they are tender, they are nice. Yes, they are! Eat them! Eat them! SAM: You'll make him sick, you will, behaving like that! GOLLUM: (screams) What's it doing?!?! FARAMIR: Bind their hands. GIMLI: ...and the dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground! THEODEN: (talking about Eowyn) ...doomed to wait upon an old man... Arwen's see-through toga-dress. Need I say more? THEODEN: Get them into the caves. THEODEN: Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed... TREEBEARD: There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods... ELROND: Arwen, it is time. GALADRIEL: Isengard has been unleashed. GALADRIEL: It is close now. So close to achieving its goal... FARAMIR: His horn washed up upon the riverbank... BOROMIR: One moment of peace, can he not give us that? SOLDIER: We found the third one. (this one's kind of obscure) FARAMIR: Down there... FRODO: This creature is bound to me. And I to him...please, let me go down to him. FARAMIR: Here in the wild I have you... GAMLING: Your men, my lord, will follow you to whatever end. GIMLI: It's a little tight across the chest. LEGOLAS: That is no orc horn. HALDIR: An alliance once existed between elves and men. GIMLI: You could have picked a better spot. ARAGORN: Show them no mercy, for you shall receive none! The angry roars of the orcs. ARAGORN: Prepare to fire! ARAGORN: Release arrows! GIMLI: Send them to me! Come on! What Gimli and Legolas say during their contest... Where Gimli hits that one orc right before Legolas goes, "Ninteen!' THEODEN: Is this it? Is this all you can conjure, Saruman? ARAGORN: Bring him down, Legolas! THEODEN: Brace the gate! The orcs' battering ram. ARAGORN: Charge! GAMLING: Get your men out of there! GIMLI: Oh, come on, we can take 'em! ARAGORN: It's a long way. ARAGORN: Hurry! Inside, get them inside! PIPPIN: Turn around. Turn around, take us south. TREEBEARD: My buisness is with Isengard tonight...with a rock and stone. FRODO: His eye is almost on me! GOLLUM: We could let her do it...

      Had more weird dreams last night.  The first one was where these people came to my house. I seemed to have been expecting them, but whatever. Anyhow, they said they were from GBS, our sister school, but our bitter rival when it comes to sports. When they came in, none of the rooms in "my" house looked like my real house. With me were some people from GBN, my school.  This is the part of the dream that gets kind of fuzzy. So we ate at this long table, and had a grand old time. Then (I don't remember how this happened) they set some weird wolf/hyena creatures on us (oddly similar to the wargs in Lord of the Rings).  So they're chasing me (and the rest of the people from GBN) all around "my house" when I hide in the one place that I remember looking like a room from my real house: the mud room/laundry room. I hide in the coat closet among my older sister's really big coats. A few seconds later, my friend Jessie joins me. She looked really freaked out.  After a while, we came out, realizing that the wolf incident was all a game. Oddly enough, we weren't mad at them. Then we went into my basement (which again, didn't look like my real basement) and watched a movie.  Yeah. I'm confused too.  The other one was yet another Lord of the Rings themed dream. I was Pippin again, but this time I was eating a meal with Denethor. He was sitting at one end of the long table, and I was at the other, but I was standing. Now the thing about this room that we were in is that the table was so long that it barely fit in the center of the room, and all around it were about three or four steps that circled the room leading to a higher level. So if you were looking at a bird's-eye view, it would look like a box inside a box inside a box...you get the picture. On the various steps were smaller tables.  Anyway. So I was forced to stand on the first step for two reasons: 1. Because the table was too long and it forced me back, and 2. because I was too short and wished to see over the table. Denethor and I talked for a while, and we slowly started telling each other riddles and questions and such.  While the riddle thing was going on, Gandalf and the rest of the hobbits came up behind me, on the top step. Denethor asked me a few more questions, but got suspicious. I think he suspected me of getting answers from Gandalf...somehow. And it had to do with me standing on the first step instead on the main level. I started to argue with him, saying that "I barely three feet tall!" but he wouldn't listen to me. So he started to chase me around the room.  The hobbits helped me out, and so did my little sister for some odd reason. We were running around the different tables. Somewhere in this process, Denethor turned into my dad. After that happened, my little sister hit him over the head with something, thinking that he was still Denethor.  I'm not sure which dream is more strange.

      Ahhhhh.  That was a sigh of relief, in case you were wondering.  I may now FINALLY post my  urlLink 16th chapter . I wrote it like a week ago but my account has been LOCKED as you know if you've been following this at all closely.  I wrote a lot today. During the Social Studies presentations I wrote a depressing one-shot. I'm not sure what I'm gonna call it or what the summary will be like. You see, I specifically don't tell who the characters are or what is going on. I leave that to the reader. So how am I going to tell people what it's about so people will read it?  Ah well. I'll figure it out.  Sarah's not online. :( I look forward to her conversations; they're lots of fun.

      Hi, Dr. Amberg. I'm not sure if this is your e-mail address, but I think my e-mail server will return this letter to me if it isn't.  Anyway. I'm just writing to show you a few connections I've made between Huck Finn and, yes you guessed it, The Lord of the Rings. I would have brought these points up in class, but nobody likes to listen to me when I make these connections (not that I blame them). Any quotes that are in here are from the movie, simply because its more accessible.  1. The interracial friendship between Huck and Jim is like the friendship between Legolas and Gimli. Legolas is a beautiful, immortal Elf. Gimli is a stocky, hearty Dwarf. For hundreds of years, the two races haven't trusted each other. And here these two are, going on this journey together, not knowing that by the end, they become trusted friends. At one point in Return of the King, Gimli states before a battle, "I never thought I'd die side by side with an Elf." Legolas asks, "What about side by side with a friend?" Glimli pauses and replies, "Aye. I could do that."  2. Instead of going north to freedom, Huck and Jim go south because they figure that's the last place people would think to look for them. The whole point of The Lord of the Rings is that the goal is to destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom, which is in the heart of Sauron's realm. Another thing about that is that the Enemy doesn't even realize that this is what they're going to do. Says Gandalf in The Two Towers, "But for all their cunning we have one advantage. The Ring remains hidden. And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams...each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom."  3. The tricksters in Huck Finn are obviously the King and the Duke. They take advantage of Huck and Jim for their own purpose: to swindle people for money. In Lord of the Rings, the tricky one is Gollum. On the outside, it looks like he's leading Frodo and Sam to Mordor. In reality, he's leading them to the giant spider, Shelob, whom he hopes will eat them so he can retain his "precious". Like Huck and Jim, Sam suspects trouble brewing, but Frodo keeps trusting Gollum and pressing on. When the King and the Duke get in trouble with the villagers, Huck feels sorry for them. Likewise, Frodo says in The Two Towers, "Maybe he does deserve to die. But now that I see him, I do pity him." And just like Gollum is leading the two Hobbits to Shelob to get the Ring back, the King sells Jim for his $40.  Hope some of these shed some light!  -Katherine  "I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened." "So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you."

      This is my letter to the Fourth Reich, a.k.a. fanfiction.net.  Dear Fanfiction.net,  I was deeply disturbed a few days back to find yet another one of my parodies deleted from my account. That brings the total to five. I still don’t understand why mine disappear.  The reason for every one of the five removals was this: MST, chat, live person related, interactive. I’d like to counter every one of those claims. First off, my stories were not MST. Those jokes were all my ideas. Every one, no exceptions. “Interactive” was also out of the question. Once in a while, a reviewer would give me a tip, and I sometimes would use it, sometimes not. Besides, that’s what a review is for: to help improve the story and the writing process. And while all those stories were in script form, none of them were chat.  The only rule that would be questionable is the live-person rule. I will admit that in one and only one of them, I did put myself in it. But the rule specifically states “non-fictional characters that are non-historical: actors, musicians, etc.” It states nothing about the author putting his or herself into the story. Also, I’ve seen several other stories with the author in the middle of everything (including a story of mine that was saved from your injustice), so this gives you absolutely no right to discontinue that particular piece.  I’ve noticed that I’m not the only one whose parodies were taken off the site. Most of these humor-slaying has been happening only recently. I’d like to pose a question: why now? One of my stories has been running since July and was only taken down this February after it was finished. Some of the other stories that were taken from other authors had been going for even longer. Many of the writers have left or are thinking about leaving. I am a member of the latter.  Please clear those issues for me by writing back to me as soon as possible.  -Katherine, penname arwentheelf02

      Great. Just awesome. So a few days ago fanfiction.net had another urge to kill a perfectly good parody of mine, which didn't bother me as much as the last one (was only on chapter 2) but I'm still kind of pissed. Well, before that I was kind of procrastinating on when I'd update my only running fic, Whose Line Is It Anyway Turns Pirate. I had just finished my latest chapter and was about to update, when I found out that my account has been locked until the 17th. God I HATE THIS WEBSITE!!! I want to LEAVE but I CAN'T because I have NOWHERE ELSE TO GO!!!  *breathes through clenched teeth*  The reason for the removal of this story: MST, chat, live-person related, interactive. I will admit to the live-person related, but WLIIATP is live-person related (they both had me) and they didn't take THAT off!! (Thank God too: if they did, I'd leave in a heartbeat.) And I've seen tons of other fics with the author as one of the characters! FYI, MST is where you take something somebody else wrote and post it as your own.  I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to fish around for other places to post my work. Yes. That's what I'm going to do, and keep fanfiction.net as a sort of cushion to fall back on if that doesn't work out.  But seriously. Why now? One of the stories that had been previously killed (in mid February) had been going since the July before that. Why did they kill it when it was all finished and popular instead when it was in its low beginning?  It's not fair. It really isn't. I'm going to send them a letter, then hurt them.  Buuuuuuuuuuuuuurn...

      Late arrival today, so got to start school at 9:40 instead of 7:40 (actually in Academy, we have to wait for the southies to come, so we started at 10 rather than 8...happy happy joy joy)!!  Ok, if you REALLY want to make me happy today, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE go  urlLink here!!!!  Thank you if you go and show your support I shall be eternally grateful to you.  I'm bored, so I think I'll sign off for the day.   SAM:  (to Frodo) I'd best find you some clothes; you can't go to Mordor in naught but your skin.  ME:  He can't??? @*(&$#!!!!

      Its Friday. Thank God.  Well, what to say. Ho hum. Its Friday. Today's a B day. Oh I know. Ms. L is back to substitute! Yay! I kind of like her better than Mr. D. (D was babysitting the baby...awww what a good father...)   urlLink Fanfiction.net  is FINALLY working again. So I uploaded  urlLink Chapter 14 . So that's a good thing.  Yeah I know the thing for this blog said "None of that Dear Diary stuff here unless that's what I want to talk about". There's been a lot of Dear Diary stuff recently, so allow me to begin my first rant...  Today I was hit by a fresh wave of Frodo Bashing, courtesy of Annie and Kristine, and a few comments from Maggie. I capitalized Frodo Bashing because it's one of the things that really gets on my nerves.  Topic #1: Ok, the only reason why Frodo goes all weird sometimes is because of the influence of the Ring! It's not because he's stoned or high or whatever the heck stupid people think that he is! It's the Ring, eating away at him. Figuratively. It's like what happened with Gollum, except Frodo's not a mutated frog. But he would be if he kept it for another 400 years or so.  Topic #2: Frodo is NOT a coward!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OK? NOT!!! He voulenteered (VOULENTEERED!!! As in he DIDN'T HAVE TO DO IT!!!) to take the Ring to Mordor. That takes guts. Lots of them. Then he had the guts enough to leave the Fellowship and go on his own (so he thought, till Sam came along). Then he had the guts enough to trust Gollum (subject of Topic #3). Then he had the guts enough to go right past Minas Morgul and up the stairs of Cirith Ungol. Then he had the guts enough to go into Shelob's lair. Then he had the guts enough to walk the plains of Gorgoth. I'd like to see YOU do that!!!!!!!!  Topic #3: Frodo is not gullible for trusting Gollum. Actually, Gollum didn't do anything bad until the whole Shelob thing. (Frodo was asleep when Gollum and Smeagol were talking to each other.) Then Frodo didn't trust Gollum anymore.  Topic #4: Frodo is not stupid for letting Sam go in the movie. Sam was forever bashing Gollum when Gollum didn't do anything (yet). And when Frodo thought that Sam ate the food (he did have "proof": the crumbs and the fact that Gollum doesn't eat Lembas), well, that was it. They had nothing left. What can you do in that situation?  Topic #5: I think I hate this one the most. Ahem. FRODO AND SAM ARE NOT GAY!!!! GET THAT THROUGH YOUR THICK SKULLS!!!!!!!!! They're friends. Good friends. That's it. They're allowed to be good, trusting friends without any romantic involvement. When Sam goes, "I love him..." in the book he means that he loves him in that brotherly way. They care for eachother, like you would for a sibling. They've gone through so much together; how could they not be like brothers?  *pant pant* Any questions?

      God yesterday was insane. Insane, but really fun.  So I wake up at like the crack of dawn (ok ok 8 am, but its a WEEKEND) and was forced to go to church, like most weeks. But this week was even more so because Father Angelo was supposed to have the sermon about the film "The Passion of the Christ". Well, it being a three day weekend, Father Angelo and his family weren't here, so Father Michael took over and preached about gossip. Um, can we say SNORE?!? I love Father Michael, but Father Angelo's sermons are better. (He doesn't even need any notes!)  But anyway. So at one o'clock I'm at Annie's house for the Shakespeare scene. Priya was already there (but what else is new? Well, can't say that, Priya and Annie are neighbors. But she's always prompt.). Zack, Patrick, and Nick came soon after. Well, while we were waiting for Adam to show up we practiced for a little in Annie's front yard after we got costumes on. Fifteen minutes later Adam's still not there. So we decide to go location scouting.  Our scene is supposed to take place in a forest. Well, there are no forests near Annie's house, so after another 15 minutes we found this huge pine tree in Priya's cul-de-sac. It's so wide that we decide to film there. Adam still hasn't come yet. We've called him a million times on both Nick's cell and at Annie's. No answer. So we film one of the parts that he's not in. (Zack climbed up the tree afterwards.)  So, we have given up on Adam. Priya calls in her brother (a year older than we are) to play Oberon. He has NO acting skills and you can barely hear him. Thank God he has few lines. So we film the rest and we're done by a little to three.  We chill at Priya's for a while, when Nick's cell starts to ring. It's (yes, you guessed it) Adam. Nick picks up. "Hello? Adam, you suck..." We all started cracking up. When Nick got off the line, he said that Adam thought that we were starting at three. I kind of feel bad for Adam though. He went to our practice the week before, and he won't get any credit. (Thank the Lord that this is an extra credit project, or Adam would be in real trouble.)  So I get home way early, and have to practice the piano (grrr). Then for the rest of the time we (Mom and I) were getting ready for the Academy Awards party. (We were having the Academy over for the Academy Awards. Get it...?) We had these shiny cardboard stars (each about a foot tall) that we put on the walls, and on each was the name of a nominated film. Cool, eh?  So the guests same at 7, and we had snacks and pizza and cake and we held predictions and we had a great time. Billy Crystal was hillarious. You know how they have like a little monologue by the host before the awards start? Oh my God, Billy Crystal did song parodies modeled to each of the films nominated for Best Picture (Lord of the Rings was to the tune of "My Favorite Things" from The Sound Of Music. Good play, that.)  I was so nervous when Best Picture rolled around. LOTR had been nominated for 11 things (including that) and they had won all 10 so far. Best Picture was the only one left. I was standing up, clutching my One Ring and my Evenstar (I was wearing both...) and when Steven Spielburg announced "It's a sweep!" I screamed and backed up against a wall. I was really close to crying. Seriously. After the acceptance speech, I slid down the wall and said, "They won. They won. They won," over and over like a mad person. Then again, I am one.  For future reference, I'll post what movies won what (but not documentary and short film and stuff like that. Who cares, anyway?).   Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King:   Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Sound Mixing, Best Origional Score, Best Origional Song ("Into the West"), Best Costumes, Best Film Editing, Best Makeup, and Best Visual Effects. *pant pant*  Mystic River: Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor (talk about male power)  Monster:  Best Actress  Cold Mountain:  Best Supporting Actress  Lost in Translation:  Best Origional Screenplay  Finding Nemo:  Best Animated Feature  Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World:  Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing

      This is my letter to ABC Family after watching their (very bad) movie, "Brave New Girl".  I'm very suprised that in the "Choose a Show" bar there wasn't an option for "Brave New Girl". I watch "Whose Line is it Anyway?" every night, religiously. One night, I counted how many times within a one-hour period, I saw a plug for that movie. I counted 7. SEVEN!!! And not only is that far too much, it wasn't worth my two hours of watching that film. It was the most cookie-cutter thing I've ever seen. Incredibly typical Made-For-TV-Movie: Girl tries to succeed. Girl has rival, who is into the same hot guy as girl. The said hot guy starts out as being full of himself, but humbles himself to help said heroine. Girl has witch-like mentor. Girl succeeds, and totally wipes said rival off the board. Great film; is it over yet? And the script...my God, what can I say about that? "Aren't you gonna tip me? Well, how about a kiss?" If you want to make this at all life-like, why don't you throw something in that somebody actually might DO?! If you're going to make me sit and watch something 80,000 times till I want to puke, you could at least come up with some original material! I trust that you will do better next time.

      Just saw "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" starring the very handsome Russell Crowe. I've seen it already, but we wanted Dad to see it, so this was our Family Movie Night Feature Presentation. The doctor is also hot; I wonder who he is? Oh, and Billy Boyd also stars (well, ok, not stars, he has his lines but not that many.), looking hot as ever, but he looked better with curly hair and an elven cloak. He traded them for an assortment of hats and a sailor's suit. Oh, well. You take what you can get, I suppose.

      You know, I had this idea for this post where I'd write all about my piano teacher's quirks that drive me nuts. However, before I went on this site I checked my e-mail. I had a message from fanfiction.net administration. Guess what they did?  That's right. They took off ANOTHER one of my stories!  And this one is the MOST infuriating because this had OVER 20 CHAPTERS AND OVER 375 REVIEWS!!!!  That's it. I'm done with this website. I'll never write for fanfiction.net again, since they do not appreciate what I do. That's fine. I'll show those sons of bitches that I don't care. I only lost one chapter, I'll put my stuff on my own website, where everybody can see it and appreciate what I do best.  But in the meantime, WILL SOMEBODY GIVE ME A SHOTGUN!?!?!? PLEASE!?!?!?!

      I realized something tonight. Chip Esten looks a lot like Jim Carey. A LOT. (Chip is hotter though.)  So you can imagine how happy I was when they were doing "Superheroes" and Chip was a Chippendales dancers (kind of ironic that his name is in there). He was movin' his hips and doing all this...stuff. He even humped this girl in the front row! (Lucky!)  Rawr.  Colin was dubbed "Captain Hair" in that game. So funny! And on Scenes from a Hat, there was "Least likely to be on the cover of 'Playboy'". Colin and Ryan just stood there...

Just because I got two C's and the rest B's on my report card, doesn't mean I'll be flipping burgers at Mickey D's for the rest of my life. And it isn't even the final grade! And it's only my freshman year!  Jeez.  On a better note, I just checked my e-mail and got 10 reviews.  w00t!!!! it was all from the same person. Double w00t!!! Actually I think it was a group of fanfiction readers, because the signature had several names. So I bow to you! *bow*

      I just recovered from an allergic reation to nuts.  Evil nuts.  I couldn't swallow well, and my skin started getting all tight and itchy. I got hives everywhere, except for my legs. I don't know why.  Thank God that's over with.  I didn't tell anybody because I didn't want it to be made a big deal out of. Then again, the last time I had a reaction was when I was in Jerusalem, in which I threw up then passed out. But that was a whole ice cream bar, this was just a chocolate egg.  I'm bored. I think I'll do my Social Studies extra credit paper thing.

      Had another Lord of the Rings dream last night.  This time I was Arwen. I was at Helm's Deep with Eowyn, and they (meaning the men there) had chained us by one wrist to wooden posts to keep us from fighting in the battle. We struggled agains the chains, but to no avail. We were trapped. Then Aragorn walked into the room. When I saw him, I kissed him. A lot. This made Eowyn really jealous of me. Then I woke up.  Then today, as I was getting ready for the day, I looked up at my Return of the King poster. I couldn't help but think about the dream, and how he looked and felt while I was kissing him. It's odd that I would even know how that feels, seeing as that I've never been kissed...  Sarah just sent me a picture of hers. IT'S SO CUTE!!!!

      I'm so confused. I really am. Both my mom and dad are like, "Are you sure you're okay with this? Do you want to talk?" But really, I don't know if I'm okay with this. Before, I  thought  I was okay with it, but yesterday evening I found myself crying while practicing piano (Dad wasn't home). But other times, I'm numb. Empty. I don't show my feelings to my parents because I have none. He's tried to do this before, but not suceeded. Maybe that's why I don't feel emotion, because we've sort of been through this before. Sort of. Or maybe I'm just stronger than I thought?  But maybe, after it happens, I will show emotion, because that's the part we have not experienced yet. Well, scratch that. We have, but only for one night. That was the worst Christmas eve of my life, the night my ignorance and innocence was lost. And only twelve years old.  It's so strange, really. To my mother and my sister, he can be so cold. Cruel, even. Hurtful in his words. But to me, he is the model father. He hugs me and says he loves me, and his hobby is to spoil me rotten. I suppose I should count myself lucky, because I've felt his wrath, and man it is not pleasant, but this makes me confused. Like a Gollum/Smeagol relationship, if I may use a Lord of the Rings annalogy. Sometimes if there was an arguement the night before, and then he comes home and hugs me, I feel like pushing back. Asking, "Who is this man and where was he last night, when there was so much pain? Why wasn't he this loving last night?"

      The Ironies of the Movie "Troy", which I saw yesterday and it kicked some serious ass   WARNING: SPOILERS!!!!!!   1. In other movies, such as Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and Pirates of the Caribbean, you know who's side you're on. You want Sauron to fall. You want Luke to become a Jedi. You want Jack to use that last shot. But in Troy, I didn't know who I wanted to win the war. I liked both the Trojans and the Greeks. There was only one person I wanted to die, and that was Agamemnon. He was a jerk-off. I hated him more than anybody in the whole movie.  2a. Major irony: that weakling boy Paris killed the strongest man in the world, Achillies. If you've seen the movie, you've seen Paris fight, and it is not pretty. Not pretty at all. But he just kills Achillies like it's no big thing. That was kind of strange.  2b. Staying on the topic of that scene...I think we can all agree that Paris is more of a lover than a fighter, right? So, it is very VERY ironic that not only did he kill Achillies, but he did it so brutally, too. I mean, Persae (I think thats her name) was screaming for him to stop because she loves him, but he kept shooting and shooting. Gosh, Paris, you DEAF?!? But then again, Achillies did kill his brother. Hmmm...  3. Achilles is the deadliest man alive in that movie. He kills without even thinking about it. But, when King Priam, his country's enemy, visites his tent, he lets him go, promising him that none of the men will touch him. Now, sure, Priam told Achillies about his troubles, so naturally Achillies pities him and respects him for his courage. But still...  More later if I think of any!

      Jeez.  That's all I can say right now. Jeez.  Here's my evening:  At 6:30, I invited Maggie, Hillary, Monica, and Chelsea over to watch Return of the King. Alexandra had invited two of her friends from Saturday school to join us.  Well, the seven of them would NOT SHUT UP!!!! Seriously. Well, Maggie was pretty good actually, as it was her first time. But God they could not keep comments to themselves!!! I don't know what was up. I finally had to yell at them to be quiet, as this is very important to me.  But when the going got tough, it was good. They were quiet in all the right places (ie Mt. Doom, Grey Havens...basically whenever I cry during the movie.) And when I did start to cry, they got me tissue and patted my arm and stuff like that. So I gotta give them credit, I suppose.  By the way, Maggie loved it. She started to cry at the Grey Havens scene. Well, at least SHE waited to cry until the end. When I saw it the first time, I was a freakin BASKET CASE!!!!!!

      (The following post only says 2:00 am because that's when I wrote it in a notebook in my room. I didn't have access to the internet at 2 am. So yes.)  My life is just one, long paradox.  Tonight I finished a book that was very good up until the end (which was really lame, if you ask me). By about 1:30 I realized that I wouldn't be sleeping for more than about six hours, so I started thinking about the book. The main character had various relationships with various people. Each time, whether they were with family members, friends, or guys, she realized that the relationship was completely fake. As usual, I started making connections to my own life. That's when I had an epiphany:  I have a good-sized family and lots of people I hang out with, so I'm rarely by myself. The paradox is that I am so alone in life. So tonight I listened to a CD and cried to my pillow.  Don't get me wrong. I'm not getting all goth-depressed-teenager. In fact, I've prided myself on being almost the anti-teen (not into rap, love my family, not obsessed with my weight, etc.). But see, for almost two years I've been pulling off the "I-Have-My-Tolkienism-Therefore-I'm-the-Happiest-Person-in-the-Universe" act, and pretty damn well too. So well that I almost fooled myself.  Almost.  Until now.  The said paradox goes like this: I have all these "friends". A friend, by definition, is a confidant, right? In the modern world, it's somebody you hang with. Your "homies" or "peeps". So my idea of a friend has always been a mix of both.  Tonight I realized that I have nobody that fits the first criteria.  My use of my friends is as such: Jessie: I use to talk about men Chelsea: To goof off. Maggie and Hillary: Undecided, but we've recently resorted to complaining about various things and also going "Wouldn't that be funny if...?" Kristine: To talk about obsessions Annie: All of the above  And so on.  But I really have no "confidant". Nobody I can spill my guts to. Mom says I need a shrink. I say that they aren't beside me everyday; they don't know what it's like to be me. My dad takes my point of view, only he really does need one. Do I really need one? I'm not sure.  That psycological disorder test was right. I really am dependant.  Maybe that's why in Lord of the Rings, when Sam would comfort Frodo, I'd feel this aching inside. I wanted that sort of connection with somebody  so badly . I wanted somebody to hold  my  hand and say "It's alright. I'm here." Only back then I had thought it had to do with me wanting a boyfriend. (Sam and Frodo are not gay, for the billionth time.) Even now, when I hear a love song, I get all sad about Pat and Nick, even though that was a long time ago and it was nothing serious. I think I was in love with the idea of being in love, something I've wanted ever since I can remember. But I digress.  On the other hand of the paradox, I don't want to burden anybody with my problems. People have their own issues, why should they have to bear mine? Maybe that's a reason why I should see a doctor. But I don;t want pills, or a fake smile and a figure in a labcoat, scribbling down my every thought and word.  I want a  REAL  connection, damn it!!!!

       ARGHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Yes, something is bothering me. Thanks for asking.  After three days of try-outs, I didn't make Express. That's the THIRD time in the past school year I've tried out for something, also the third time I've been rejected.  I'm so sick of being rejected.  And of COURSE Julie made it. Because she's perfect. She gets everything handed to her on a silver platter...maybe with some gold trimming around the edges. I'm not denying that she's good. She is good. But the problem is that her voice isn't mature. She sounds like she belongs in a Disney movie. They're good singers, but...you know what I'm saying?  And even when I went to play InuYasha Demon, this new game I'm hooked on, to blow off steam, I got killed within the first three rounds.  I can't do anything right.  I mean really. I'm a total wreck. Somebody should just pick me up and throw me in a garbage dump. I mean, take a look:  1. My grades are dismal 2. I look like somebody shoved an air tube up my nose and puffed up my face 3. My family life is awful 4. I'm doing only one extracurricular activity, which I don't like (hmmm...maybe it's because whenever I try out for something, I get CUT LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER!!!) 5. I don't have a boyfriend  I'm just cluttering up the Earth, like that movie we saw in Bio about population.

      Ok, so I lend my older sister my laptop for a few days so she can upload her CDs onto her new iRiver (which is like an iPod, only she did research and found it was better). So this morning, I come downstairs and she changed the background on my laptop.  You see, Kristina and I are different as night and day. And she hates Lord of the Rings. So she changed the background to Frodo with a big red x over his face and then her marching band ( her  passion) right next to it, and under she put our school's motto.  When I saw it, I admit it, I kind of overreacted. I had just woken up, too (not that that's a good excuse, but it might be a reason). I ordered her repeatedly to change it, and she said no. Well last night she had left her Blue Man Group CD in my laptop, so I'm holding it hostage until she apologizes.  I e-mailed my mom recently, and I said sorry for the way I acted, but in the e-mail I said this:  But, before we call this to a close, see this from my point of view. Don't you think this is an infringement of trust? I gave her permission to use my laptop, I gave her the  password  (which I changed after getting it back), I give her some of the memory from my computer, and she goes and ridicules what I love. Is that right?  I will think twice about lending her something of mine again.

      I sent this e-mail today to Kristine, Sarah, and Jack. This is actually a good question.  Hey I was watching Return of the King today and I had a thought. Yes this is me analyzing LOTR again.  Ok. If Sauron got the Ring all Middle Eath would be doomed and blah blah blah right? So then, what was the point of waging battles against Helm's Deep, Osgiliath, Minas Tirith, and Lothlorien? (yes there were assaults on Lothlorien, it says in the timelines. Go find it if you're THAT curious) If all he needed was the Ring to rule Middle Earth, shouldn't he be focusing all his forces on finding it? He could have saved so much time and soldiers (although orcs are fast in reproducing) if he had just stuck to finding the Ring. He actually might have succeeded.  Chew on that and e-mail me back.  -Katherine

      Hi all. Today was pretty fun. I played The Sims for like 3 hours this morning and got myself to marry FRODO!!! OH YES HOW I LOVE MY BAGGINS!!!!! I watched "Return of the King" also...yes I cried again. But not as much as usual. Perhaps it is because both sisters were present, although only one of which was watching. The movie, not me cry.  OH yes I also had my first yes very FIRST voice lesson today. YES I've finally broken my vocal virginity. She's a very nice elderly lady but I don't remember her name. Ah well. She has a cute little doggy named Belle (the daughter she never had). She likes my voice, which is a good thing. You don't want a voice teacher that's like RAWR YOU SUCK!!!  No you do not.  Anyway, she likes Rogers and Hammerstien (she was even in the Sound of Music as the Head Nun. A good part that is, although notes are window-shattering), so we sang some songs from SoM. Good fun. I'm going again Thursday, and then every Thursday after that till I leave for Europe.

      (The following post only says 1:24 am because that's when I wrote it. I saved it as a word document. I didn't have access to the internet at 1:24 am. So yes.)  There is something I’ve desired all my life. It started out as an immature want, something I was far too young to have. Now, I am old enough to understand what I really want in life. I want to find someone. Sometimes I feel empty, incomplete. I’m constantly searching. I want to find somebody who, when I’m with them, chases away the void I feel inside.  Now that I think about it, all the movies I love: Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean, even Monty Python, are stories of companionship. I wonder: if Frodo was traveling to Mordor alone, as he originally planned, would I find the story as riveting as I do? If Luke saved the Rebellion all by himself, would I wait so patiently for the next film? It King Arthur searched for the Holy Grail without his knights, would I laugh half as hard? I don’t know.  Perhaps that’s why I love movies so much. When I’m watching a film, I am no longer myself. I am reduced to a spirit, watching the actions of the characters, taking it all in. I escape to Middle Earth, a galaxy far far away, or a ship on a sparkling blue sea, even if it is only for a few hours. I want somebody who I can escape this world with, just like a great movie.  I know that I am a Christian and everything, but I don’t know. Religion doesn’t seem to cut it for me in this case. I know that Christ is always there and everything, but what I need is a friend, not a savior. I want somebody I can talk to, and with all due respect to the Father, He doesn’t talk back to me.  Earlier in this post I said that “I’m old enough to understand what I really want in life”. Ironically, I don’t really understand it. Am I looking for a friend, or am I looking for a lover? That I can’t say. There are pluses to both. With a friend I can be totally frank with. With a lover the relationship is more deep and intimate. Well, whatever God decides to give me, I’ll be eternally thankful for.  But could He hurry it up a bit?

      Yesterday I got back from camp. What a fun week it was. Here's how a typical day would go: 7:00 AM: Wake up. Ugh. Never fun, as my roommates were nocturnal. 8:00 AM: Morning service. Not so bad, because it was like 20 minutes long. But then there was a sermon. Good or boring depending on the priest that gave it. 8:30 AM: Breakfast. Everybody hates the food there, but I like it. I'm not sure why they hate it. But I don't like their mashed potatoes. Taste like cardboard. Ick. 9:00 AM: Supposedly "Cabin Clean-Up". More like "Lay on your bed for a half an hour to make up for lost sleep". 9:30 AM: Athletics. Yes, Athletics at 9:30 in the morning. Surprisingly a good thing, as it wakes you up. Usually consisted of softball or races. 10:30 AM: Orthodox Christian Life (OCL). A class in the chapel where priests talk to you about life as an Orthodox Christian. Kind of interesting. The last day of OCL they gave us a cookie. OH and on Tuesday they had a speaker that talked about abstinence and STDs. She was really really really scary. But I got to talk to her during free time and she was really nice. So I dunno. She likes to brag about her daughter (who sounds like a perfect angel). 11:30 AM: Diakonia, which is the Arts and Crafts class. We made incense burners, kites, icons, and plaques. The first two I left at camp because they sucked. 12:30 PM: Lunch. 1:00 PM: The beginning of a two and a half hour long free time during which you are not allowed back in your cabins. But the presence of a snack shop made up for that flaw. There were sports tournaments going on that you could watch/play in (if you had signed up). 3:30 PM: More cabin clean-up. 4:00 PM: Theater class. This is where you go into small groups and practice a skit that you get to preform on friday night. I sang, like I do every year. This year I sang "Into the West" from Return of the King. Got a standing ovation :-D. 5:00 PM: Bible Study. Mr. D is the leader of the class (he's blind btw, but the best story teller of all time), but then you break up into your groups (I was in group Luke with Father Jim, the biggest Cubs fan of all time.) 6:00 PM: Dinner. 7:00 PM: Evening activity, which changed from day to day. Monday was the boat ride (boring), Tuesday was the Olympics and Greek night (boring), Wednesday was the Sing a Long (fun) and the Scavenger Hunt (exhausting), Thursday was the dance or the bonfire (went to the bonfire, told many stories) and Friday was Skit Night (lots of fun! many funny skits). 9:30 PM: Get ready for bed 10:00 PM: Quiet Time 11:00 PM: Lights out  This schedule is accurate unless you count Thursday, which went like this: 7:00 AM: Wake-up 7:30 AM: Divine Liturgy 9:30 AM: Breakfast 10:00 AM - 5:00 PM: Outdoor free time (during which there were many sports, including the Priests vs. Counselors Baseball game. Very very amusing, I took many pictures. Priests won 8-6) 6:00 PM: Dinner 7:00 PM: Dance or Bonfire. I chose the latter because although I'm very good at dancing, I can't make them up very well, so I still look like an idiot on the dance floor. We told many stories about the Saints and miracles, and then three very funny Orthodox-related stories. I'll write them down later.  Then after that was the same as the other days.  Yes, it was a fun week.  P.S.: When I got back home, I found that I did not fail the Bio final, as I had feared. I got a B!!!!!

      What to write what to write what to write...  I have had the WORST case of Writer’s Block for the past two or three months. It’s depressing. It really is. Because for a long time, the only thing I was writing my awesome parody, “Whose Line is it Anyway Turns Pirate”. And then ff.net (which stands for fake fuckers, if you didn’t know), killed it because it was in script form. Um, hello? Shakespeare wrote in script form, and where is he now? INTERNATIONAL FAME, that’s where!!!  So I sit here, listening to my 74 Whose Line tracks (the one playing right now is the Baldness Hoedown...poor, poor Colin), waiting for a spark of inspiration. Still nothing.  God. Mom says lights out and it’s only 11:15 on a summer night. Dad wants us to be up before 10:30 to watch Regan’s funeral because its “history”. You know, he also said that Clinton’s impeachment was “history”, but all it lead to was endless Monica Lewinskey jokes courtesy of Jay Leno. Clinton got to keep his job.  Anyway, I’m sorry to say this, but I wasn’t alive during the reign of Regan, so he’s not all that special to me. I know I sound like any 14 year old living in 2004, but it’s true. I don’t really care. Yeah he was president, yeah he was a good guy, but he’s dead. It HAPPENS, people!!! And there has not been a single moment on the news where they haven’t mentioned his trek across the country. “This just in, Regan is still dead.” I mean, seriously.  The MTV movie awards were very disappointing. I mean, yeah, I’m way happy that Return of the King won Best Picture and Best Action Sequence, but it still sucked. Everything was better last year. The host was better (Sean William Scott and Justin Timberlake were GENIUS!!! Lindsey Lohan was just blah.), the comedy routine before the show was WAY better (the Matrix Reloaded thing was hilarious!! This just sucked. Especially when they played on the Sam/Frodo idea. I HATE THAT SO MUCH IT MAKES ME CRAZY!!!!!), the nominees were better (at least last year’s noms made SENSE!!!), the winners were better (I love Sean William Scott, but he should have NOT won Best Dance Scene), the music performances were better (if that could even be said...popular music today SUCKS), even the announcers were better. It was horrible.

      Damn. I think I failed the bio final.  It was SO HARD. I didn't even remember STUDYING some of that stuff!!! And don't even talk to me about the written questions. God Almighty, why do you hate me?!?!?!?  My dad is going to murdur me with an axe. He's so *rawr* about grades.  I can't even play Inuyasha Demon for the next half an hour; I can't find the thing that controls volume. That would be embarassing if I went to play the game and the sound was on.  Did I mention that my sister got her ACT scores back? She got a 35.  My mom screamed higher than a Ringwraith on helium.

      Hullo hullo hullo. It's Mondayyyyy. *screams of pain heard in the distance* But that's ok because tomorrow is the last day of school! And it's my bio final tomorrow! *more screams of pain* Oh well. I should be ok, this semester was easier than last semester. I think.  Well, yesterday I got back from the Oratorical Festival. I lost, but that's ok. The judging was REALLY REALLY close. Close as in a person on the top of one list was at the bottom of the other, etc etc. The interesting thing is that both the 1st place winners were last in performing their speeches. My mom has a minor in psychology and she says that the first and last people to go always leave the most prominent impressions. I don't mind the senior winner. She was really good. But I don't think the junior winner should have won. She was rather dead sounding.  I need to clean my room really REALLY badly. Papers strewn everywhere. But I just taped the "King Arthur" poster I got in the newspaper up. It looks so nice on my closet door next to my giant "Return of the King" poster...

       (The time is the time in Europe, not Chicago)   Argh I hate planes. No me gusta nada. NADA I tell you. Cramped in the evils of coach class. The air is stale and lifeless.&nbsp; Bleh at planes. The man in front of me has put his chair back, so now there is less than a foot between the tip of my nose to his chair.&nbsp; In fact, I can put my thumb on my nose and my pinkie on the chair. Grandma and Grandpa are snoring away to my left.  Worse, this isn't the last plane. Nope, after this, we have an hour and a half in Madrid, then on another plane to Vienna. But at least they showed a good movie ("Shattered Glass", starring Hayden Christianson).  I have never slept on a plane in my life. By the time we get to Vienna, my inner clock will think its the wee hours of the morning (with still no sleep).&nbsp; It will actually be mid to late morning.

      Gah! Katherine's body has been through a lot recently &nbsp; Yesterday I woke up at 5 in the morning because I was sleeping in the tent in my dad's backyard. Alexandra woke up and was trying to get out and there was all this rustling and that woke me up. Then I was at tennis and a few minutes into it I&nbsp; felt sick, but I stuck it out for a long time. Then, with about 15 minutes until we could leave, I threw up. Then I was at my voice lesson and I threw up again (in the&nbsp;toilet thank God, so she never knew it and I never told her). And at 2 in the morning, again. I have a 100 degree fever and am exhausted. I missed Alexandra's play, which I was really excited to see. Meep! Not feeling well.

I'm rarely on my own - a wasted day Is any day that's spent without a friend, With nothing much to do or hear or say.  I like to be with people, and depend On company for being entertained; Which seems a good solution, in the end.     What Poetry Form Are You?         You are Xuan Wu!  Mythological background: Because the turtle has a thick, solid shell that serves as protection -  this animal is associated with stability. You enjoy intellectual pursuits.  Also, in Feng Shui (the Chinese myths behind choosing a house), the black turtle's solidity is used to protect from cold northern winds.    urlLink   Which Chinese Mythological  Being  Are You?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Your soul is OPTIMISTIC.

      Augh Katherine is being bitched at.  Yesterday, I saw "King Arthur" with one of my friends, Hillary. I've known Hillary for almost five years now. She's always been a great friend and an amazing person. She's one of the sweetest people I know.  But let me tell you, she is not the same person that I met five years ago.  Unless I am quite mistaken, we were pretty much alike. Apart from that I'm a Star Wars fan and she's a Star Trek fan and that we have different tastes in fashion, we had a lot of things in common. We had a lot to talk about. But now its like "...". And AUGH it's annoying.  But what's worse is when she complains. Don't get me wrong, up until now I haven't heard a peep from her unless it was something she really feels strongly about. But let me give you an example of something that happened yesterday. There was a short make-out scene in "King Arthur". And after the movie, all she would say was "Romance kills a plot like no other," a statement I totally disagree with. I've been in love, and I know how important it is to a person (or character). But I just kept my mouth shut because it's not a big deal and I don't want to be like RAWR over a trifle.  But it is annoying.  Or another example while we were waiting for her mom to pick us up:  Me: Did you see any previews for that hillarious looking Will Ferrell movie? Her: I saw some previews for a Will Ferrell movie that looked pointless and stupid... Me: ...  Argh!  And now, today, my mom is making me clean my room AND vacuum the first floor in addition to going to piano, going to my cousin's play, AND having my grandparents over for dinner. Because the day before I went with Hillary, I was told I couldn't go unless I cleaned my room that day. Well, the day came and nobody reminded me (plus you forget things in your sleep...or at least I do), so I went with my room looking like a tornado site. So as my punishment, I'm vacuuming while the rest of the family goes to the big annual sidewalk sale.  You know, I've been mostly a good kid. Apart from being lazy and giving my parents a little lip, I've been good. And all they do is rag on me. School, piano, tennis, cleaning, bitch, bitch, BITCH!!!  Argh I'm not in a good mood.  On a happier note, King Arthur is really good. That's going on my "Must Buy When at Blockbuster" list.

      Good morning, agents. How are you feeling? Your assignment today, should you choose to complete it, is this: go to google.com and type in "You know you're from (your state) when". I have done that for all the noble citizens of Illinois. I received the following (and have added comments to each one):  1. You've never met any celebrities. (True, unfortunately.) 2. Your idea of a traffic jam is ten cars waiting to pass a tractor on the road. (Maybe, if I can't see the tractor.) 3. "Vacation" means going to Six Flags. (No, but Six Flags is fun.) 4. You've seen all the biggest bands ten years after they were popular. (Guilty...my dad sees Chicago every year) 5. You measure distance in minutes. (Guilty...SO GUILTY) 6. You know several people who have hit a deer. (No, but on the way to Michigan we counted how many dead deer we saw on the road. I think it was 12 one way.) 7. Your school classes were canceled because of cold. (Yup.) 8. Your school classes were canceled because of heat. (I think so...) 9. You've ridden the school bus for an hour each way. (Ha ha close.) 10. You've ever had to switch from "heat" to "A/C" in the same day. (Yeah more than once a year.) 11. You think ethanol makes your truck "run a lot better." (Meh?) 12. You know what's knee-high by the Fourth of July. (Meh again?) 13. Stores don't have bags; they have sacks. (Depends on the bag) 14. You see people wear bib overalls at funerals. (Only been to two funerals in my life.) 15. You see a car running in the parking lot at the store with no one in it no matter what time of the year. (Who writes this stuff?) 16. You end your sentences with an unnecessary preposition. Example: "Where's my coat at?" or "If you go to town I wanna go with." (Yeah that's me sometimes.) 17. All the festivals across the state are named after a fruit, vegetable, grain, or animal. (If there were any festivals in suburbia, I'm sure they would be.) 18. You install security lights on your house and garage and leave both unlocked. (Haha yeah.) 19. You think of the major four food groups as beef, pork, beer, and Jell-O salad with marshmallows. (Haha not with MY mother.) 20. You carry jumper cables in your car. (Don't know much about cars.) 21. You know what "cow tipping" and "snipe hunting" is. (Heard of both...) 22. You only own 3 spices: salt, pepper, and ketchup. (Yes guilty of that one) 23. You design your kid's Halloween costume to fit over a snowsuit. (Change snowsuit to sweater and it'll work just fine.) 24. Driving is better in the winter because the potholes are filled with snow. (Yes that is so true.) 25. You think everyone from a bigger city has an accent. (Yup besides Chicago.) 26. You think sexy lingerie is tube socks and a flannel nightie. (Ok...no.) 27. The local paper covers national and international headlines on one page but requires 6 pages for sports. (Guilty for the city-wide paper.) 28. You think that deer season is a national holiday. (Rabbit Season! Duck Season! Rabbit Season...!) 29. You know which leaves make good toilet paper. (Um...) 30. You find -20 degrees F "a little chilly." (Haha I'm sure we would.) 31. You know all 4 seasons: Almost Winter, Winter, Still Winter, and Construction. (THAT IS SO TRUE!!!) 32. You know if another Illinoisan is from southern, middle or northern Illinois as soon as they open their mouth. (Probably.) 33. There is a Dairy Queen in every town with a population of 1000 or more. (How did they know?) 34. You actually get these jokes. (Some of em.)  Unfortunately, men, most of these assume that you do not live in the Chicagoland area. They think that you live in hick country, which is 95% of the state.  This message will self-distrust in five...four...three...two...one...

      Yay I got my first archery set today!! It's perty and red and the arrows are too. It's a junior set but hey, it was between that or the kind they use in the Olympics. So it's all good. I was out there for like 20 minutes today, practicing. I hit a few bulls-eyes. So that was good. Discovered that you should aim down and a little to the right. And we rented three movies (Catch Me if you Can, Miracle, and Something's Gotta Give). And in a few minutes we're going to a Mexican restaurant. So yes. Good day so far, until we have to go to PIANO LESSONS!! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!!!

      ACK ACK ACK!!!!!  Apparently, there is a new season of "Whose Line is it Anyway", my favorite TV show in the whole WORLD. It's on Channel 7 Thursdays at 8. It was in limbo, until we signed petitions and started websites and wrote letters and stuff. They were probally like "AUGH NO MORE OK OK OK WE'LL PUT IT BACK ON!!!!!!!" And now the masses (myself included) are like, "YAY!!!!"  So it's Thursday at 8, and OF COURSE I forget about it.  Oh well, it's back, so I have all the time in the world!!!!!!!! YAY!!!!!!

      Wow for the first time in a long time I had a dream that I remember! It was strange too!  So my Dad and I are in some church place (it looks really familiar too...but I can't place where I've seen it before). And we're standing in front of the altar (you know how some churches have steps leading to the altar? yeah we're standing on the top one of those). Guess who's with us? The cast of "Whose Line is it Anyway"! Wayne was there, Colin was there, Ryan was there, and Greg was there. Guess who was at the pulpit? President Bush. I have no idea what he was doing there.  Anyway, the Whose Line crew and I do a bunch of Hoedowns while my dad and Greg just watch. But they're not origional Hoedowns. They're all Hoedowns that I have saved on my laptop and have memorized due to repeated listening sessions. Wayne takes the first verse, I do the second, Colin the third, and Ryan the fourth. However, I'm so excited that I always accidentally do Colin's along with mine.  Just as we've done so many Hoedowns that I'm about to go nuts, we start an Irish Drinking song. My dad and Greg join us. However, as anybody who's watched Whose Line should know, due to the music, you can't do an Irish Drinking song with six people. So what we do is that we're all sitting down and anybody that has an idea for the next line just stands up, blurts it out, then quickly sits down again and lets the next person go. Again, its an Irish Drinking song that I have downloaded and memorized. The only odd thing is that when it gets to the very last line, I stand up and say a different line than the one I have downloaded.  Isn't that the oddest dream? And I remember it so vividly too.
