       This is an exceptionally important article to read concerning the threat to the family.  Do you see the correlation here between this story and my previous post on the strip club that wants President Bush out.  I hope you are beginning to see, as I do, that the forces of evil are against this president.   Here is a snippet from the article.  PLEASE READ THE WHOLE THING -- THIS  MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE OF OUR DAY!!!  "Ten years from now, no one, except in a very few places, will be able to run and win without the gay and lesbian vote. We're committed to making sure this party is on the right side of history," Barron said.  "Especially in the presidential race, we'll either elect someone to the office of president who will use that office to promote this amendment or someone like John Kerry, who won't lend this amendment any credence," said John Marble, communications director of the National Stonewall Democrats, the country's largest Democratic organization for gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgenders. While Kerry, the presumptive Democratic nominee, opposes the amendment, he does not support same-sex marriage.  In terms of mobilizing the gay vote, the Cathedral of Hope's Piazza said, "What we need to do is be as strategic as the religious right has been. The religious right targets precinct by precinct, so state legislatures are radically more conservative than the states themselves."  The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force has adopted such a grass-roots approach, Foreman said, particularly in such battleground states as Ohio, Oregon and Michigan, where conservative groups are gathering signatures to get amendments banning same-sex marriages on the ballot.  "What we're really focusing on now is voter identification. That means going door to door, having face-to-face conversations with voters, determining where they stand on our issues and then getting them out to vote," Foreman said.  In 2002, he said, such a strategy contributed to Miami-Dade County in Florida retaining an ordinance banning discrimination based on sexual orientation. The task force identified 94,000 anti-discrimination voters and got them out to vote, and "it was clear in the result that that was what made the difference," Foreman said.     urlLink Yahoo!

       Interesting article.  Let me ask you a question... why would this strip club want the President out of the office?     "It's not to say our industry loves John Kerry or anything like that," said Dave Manack, associate publisher of E.D. Publications, which publishes Exotic Dancer magazine. " But George Bush, if he's re-elected, it could be very damaging to our industry. "  Fearful that conservatives might turn off the colored lights for good, a trade organization for adult night clubs is asking owners to register customers and employees and then encourage them to cast their ballots against the president. Micheal Ocello, president of the Association of Club Executives, said the group believes the president's brand of conservatism is bad for business.   "We must do everything within our power to help ensure that Bush and his ultra conservative administration are removed from the White House," Ocello wrote in a letter to nearly 4,000 club owners. "If we are to survive, we must act now."    He's right in one regard.  We MUST act now to keep George Bush in the White House!   urlLink Yahoo!

						   From John Kerry's official campaign website comes this picture celebrating John Kerry's campaign plane.    Let me ask you this question.  Why is John Kerry chewing out conservatives for running SUV's and "gas guzzlers" when he is flying around in a jet that generates more than 50 times or more the pollution and consumes 50 times or more fuel?   urlLink John  Kerry for President Blog

						   Once you've read enough of these types of articles, you begin to see John Kerry's style.  They are:  1) He consistently blames the President for every problem in America... EVEN if he had absolutely no control or influence over it.  2) He inflates the facts to make them worse then they are.  3) He completely contradict himself and exposes the hypocrisy of his party.  4) Offers no solution for what he would do if he were president.  All four are pointed out beautifully in this article.   urlLink Yahoo! News - Kerry Faults Bush for High Gas Prices

						   President Bush continues his campaign to improve the US economy.  Despite the cackling of the liberals in the nation, the President continues to push forward in pursuing what is best for Americans.  An example of this is  urlLink this story  in recently released by AFP.  This is a leader that understands the USâ€™ dependency on the other nations of the world to improve the economy of the homeland.  Like Reagan, he is actively pursing the opportunities of brining some of the money from other nation to ours.

       Hello all!  I just wanted to let you know that I got straight A's during the semester.  I was really surprised.  I don't think I've ever had straight A's in my life.  Just goes to show what a little encouragement from a wonderful wife can do.  Anyway, thanks for visiting this new site.  I hope to keep it updated often.  -Mike Farmer
