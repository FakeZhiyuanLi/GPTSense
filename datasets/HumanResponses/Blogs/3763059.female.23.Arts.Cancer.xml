      what is the difference between a human life, and that of another creature?  why is it that humans mourn each others passing so deeply yet ignore the passing of major parts of our planet?  there are so many people living on this planet that a plague could sweep through and the universe wouldn't be phased for a single moment.  with 6.3 billion humans populating this world, can we really set a level of importance to each and every one of us?  a full city of humans being wiped out is still minuscule when compared with some species of animals.  why is it that we do not mourn the passing of a panda bear, or a whale?  there are so few of these creatures left that each one represents so many human lives.  with only 1600 pandas in the wild, a figure that has risen by 40% in the last 25 years, there are almost 4 million humans for every one panda.  why is it that we do not show equal respect to these creatures?  and worse yet, entire areas of ecosystem have been wiped out, with out a tear from us.  most of us don't even know about it.  an oil spill, a forest fire, a clear cutting.  these things are monumental to the life of the earth and have a huge effect on it, whether human or non.  we depend on the earth and its creatures and plants for survival.  when a rainforest the size of a city is cleared within the span of a few years, how relevant really is a train wreckage?  we collectively mourn such events as wars, the holocaust, and september 11th year after year.  the youth of today are programmed to respect and celebrate for soldiers of a past lifetime they will never know.  they are made to perform plays, sing songs, and recite poetry about days hundreds of years ago.  but ask them about a major oil spill 15 some odd years ago and they will stare at you with blank faces.  and do they know of the land consuming ways in which all the objects they cherish are built?  the million of acres we dub natural resources are vastly disappearing, and we hold no memorials.  events that have forever changed the lives of every creature on this planet are caused solely by one.  and they don't care.

      ahhhhh, milk.  refreshing, wholesome, nutritious.  while many people in this world are at this very moment enjoying a cool glass of moo juice, i sit here pondering the ways of this drink.  i have been rolling these things over in my brain for a couple of months now, and have yet to come to any solid conclusion about my questions.    question one:  why do we go to so much trouble to collect, process and drink cows milk?  i mean, back in the days of...well, whenever milk was first collected...who decided to go into that field and pull up a teat?  surely if i was wandering through a field 500 years ago and got a little thirsty, i wouldnt go suck a cow.  i would look for water, or a juicy cantelope, or a second cup (or the past day equivelent).  okay, maybe second cup isn't such a good example since everything they make has cows milk in it.  but i'm sure you get my point.  why do we not have barns full of cats, or dogs, or elephants hooked up to milking machines.  despite the fact that cows produce muchos milk, you never see any other species drinkning anothers milk.  what would you do if you were wandering through the great canadian wilderness, and stumbled upon a grizzly bear suckling on a white tailed deer (other than crapping yourself in fear)?  my point?...it's not normal.  question two:  why do we pour it on cereal?  who ever thought "hey, i'm gonna take this stuff and cover it in milk cause soggy things like this are great!"  would you do it to potato chips? or cooked spagetti?  and why wasn't it lemonade?  i thought about this, and experimented.  lemonade + cereal = blarg!  although in a more recent breakthrough pink lemonade poured over french vanilla ice cream is quite delicious.    update...ok.  so as an update to this, i have done some research and found out loads of interesting things about cows milk vs human milk, and what most doctors reccomend.  cows were first gathered and milked, along with sheep during the bronze age (2750bc-700bc) originating around switzerland.  i still have yet to understand why people decided they needed to drink milk past weaning from human breast milk.  doctors say that human babies riased on cows milk or formula based on cows milk are 120 times as likely to die in infancy than babies raised on breast milk, and when weaned not to drink milk anymore.  milk has been linked with diseases such as anemia, iron deficiency, asthma, allergies, sinusitis, acne, and heart disease.  so why is it so largely pushed in the media, and by schools and the nutrition boards funded by the government?  well, surprise suprise 60% of all US congressmen have had partial funding for their campaigns by the National Dairy Council.  the government in return uses a certain percentage of their educational funding to purchase milk for schools.  it is much like the debate we had in canada a few years ago about coke and pepsi mahcines in schools, and funding vs advertising.  and with 1/7 of all US grocery $'s going towards dairy purchases, is it any wonder that this deal exists?  this is only a small part of all the interesting things to read...for more check out the link.    http://www.all-creatures.org/cb/a-cowsmilk.html

      population: tami.   the spaceship has landed, and as i emerged from the hatch i looked around and gasped...i was sitting at my computer desk.  so i am now an official geek with a blog (no offense fellow bloggers), but i don't feel any different.  oh, how sterile and un-emotional the computer moniter is!  and how i can hide behind it, and not have to have anyone know that i am an official blogger...well except for the fact that i used my name, my location, and all other means of ways to identify who i am in my profile.  yes, so except for that minor setback i am completely unidentifiable.  well, i suppose this is more of an extended visit to geekdom than a move per say.  i'll see how it goes before i start picking out china.
