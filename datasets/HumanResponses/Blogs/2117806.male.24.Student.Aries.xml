       "I Gave Her My Best Kiss She Gave It Back Again"   I retook the GRE this morning up in Oklahoma City.  It's been almost two years since the last time I took it, back on December 26, 2001.  At 8:00 in the morning.  Eight o'clock in the morning the day after Christmas is a hell of a time to be taking the GRE.  Noon on Halloween is much better.  I've basically spent the day in isolation.  Since I took the GRE this morning instead of working, I didn't see anyone from work (including coworkers and athletes).  I've seen people in the bank, the GRE testing facility, and on the road, but I really haven't had any conversations with anyone.  I haven't smiled at anyone today, though I did laugh at some of the stuff my father said over the telephone earlier this evening.  But a phone conversation just isn't the same.  All the friends I'd have hung out with this evening had prior engagements--either dinners, get togethers with other people, in Arkansas or some other distant state, or attending parties I wasn't invited to or wouldn't be comfortable at.   So it's another solo Halloween, just as last year was.  That's okay, though--I watched anime instead, and now I'm going to go work on grad school apps (almost got 'em done, thankfully).  The sad thing is, I really need to sort of prepare myself to deal with a lot of isolation.  Come May, I graduate from OU.  Come August, I'll (hopefully) be attending a university in some other state: either Missouri, Virginia, Ohio, or Wisconsin.  I don't really know many people in any of them (I know one person in Missouri, and a few in Virginia, but the person I know in Missouri doesn't live anywhere near St. Louis, and I'm not even sure if the school in Virginia would enable me to pursue my teaching goals).  The fact of the matter is, I'm going to be heading off for parts basically unknown in less than a year.  Not only that, my discipline is such that I probably won't encounter many people on a social basis.  Sure, I'll see people in classes, I'll see people in whatever apartment complex I live in, and I'm sure I'll even get to know a couple of them.  But will I be able to form the bonds I have at Ozarks, or even here at OU?  The only reason I know most of the people I know here is because I met them through an old high school friend or I already knew them (mostly because they were former Ozarks students like myself).  I've only met one person here who is completely unconnected to anyone else I knew prior to coming here, and I work with him.  We were sort of thrown into a situation where we had to interact, and it just so happened that we got along and there were circumstances allowing us to just sit around and chat aimlessly for hours, discovering we had quite a bit in common (and that I amused him, something I apparently do quite well for many people).  The fact is, I don't really make friends that easily.  It's not that I'm not a friendly, easy-going person, or difficult to like, or anything like that.  Part of it is that I'm an introvert, and my basic response to meeting new people is to either withdraw into my shell or make quiet, wry comments until the person laughs.  So far, I've basically gotten by on the skin of my teeth and by dint of the fact that several of the people I've met are extroverts.  I can't always rely on either factor.  And as I said, my discipline is one which lends itself to isolation.  We research, we study, we read, we attend class, we write papers.  Historians are actually quite boring people.  We don't have much time for socializing, and I've noticed that virtually every other history grad student around here is rather...dour.  Somber.  Maybe they're just really focused on their discipline, I dunno.  But they strike me as rather self-absorbed, unaware that there's a world around them, and too wrapped up in making sure they know everything they can about history that they don't care if they have friends or not.  I like history, but I want something outside of it for when I get tired or bored of battles, names, dates, and religious controversy involving people who died three or four hundred years ago.  I want living people with energy and life in them.    I guess what it all really boils down to is that I'm afraid to move on, afraid to change.  If I can stay in the situation I'm in, where I'm familiar with it and comfortable, then I can continue to feel safe and secure.  I can remain happy.  But if I change that situation, if I move to a new place where I'm unfamiliar with my surroundings and with the people, there's always the chance I won't be happy there, that I'll be very unhappy.  Sure, it's a pretty stupid and irrational reason to not want to face change, to not take a risk, but no one ever said irrational fears would make sense.  That would make them rational, and a rational irrational fear is nonsensical, thus being very irrational in and of itself.  But I digress.  Ultimately, I think what I really want to do is take all my friends with me, drag them along wherever I go like a security blanket while I suck on my thumb.  I know I can't do that, and that even though we'll be in different places we'll still be friends, it doesn't make dealing with it any easier, I guess.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Tom Petty, "Crawling back to you"

       "Words Fail--Buildings Tumble"   I went out stargazing with some friends last night out at Lake Thunderbird (Lake Dirtybird to the locals).  We were going out to see the aurora that we were supposed to be able to see because of the massive solar flare that was going on the past couple of days.  Unfortunately, the aurora wasn't viewable at the time we were out there.  But the view was beautiful nonetheless.  What does that have to do with anything?  Not a thing.  I just wanted to relate that to you.  Having grown up in a town that thought it was a city, I never really got to see many stars.  There was always too much light pollution from the surrounding area for the sky to be very visible, even on a clear night.  Sure, I know what the stars look like, and I can even pick out a couple of constellations.  But for the most part, I never really looked at the sky that much.  My eyes tended not to stray above the horizon.  Hell, I was lucky if they even strayed beyond the square of ground under my feet.  So being able to go out into something that felt like the middle of nowhere (and apparently a creepy middle of nowhere, to hear Beth and Jess talk about it) and be able to see the stars was nice.  It was like being back in Yellowstone almost, though the scenery below the stars wasn't quite as impressive.  I've been listening to two things lately--well, three if you count whining athletes.  But I'm talking about music here.  The first is the Beatles.  I borrowed four or five of their CDs from dad (despite being what you might casually call a Beatles afficionado, or even a Beatlemaniac, if you will, I only actually own a couple of their albums myself.  There's never been a reason for me to purchase the rest, as dad's had them), and I've been spinning them in the CD player in the car pretty much constantly.  The other musician I've been listening to is the great Bob Dylan.  I just go through cycles--last week, I ended a Van Morrison cycle after playing his latest opus, "What's Wrong with this Picture?" about a dozen times.  Now it's the Beatles and Dylan.  For the Dylan, I've been listening to basically everything I have of his, from his early folk stuff ("Freewheelin' Bob Dylan") to his three masterful mid-70s albums ("Blood on the Tracks," "Desire," and "The Basement Tapes"), his revelatory mid-60s electric stuff ("Highway 61 Revisited" and "Bringing it all back Home," mostly), his mellow country-rock duo of "John Wesley Harding" and "Nashville Skyline," and his latter-day masterpieces ("Time out of Mind" and "Love & Theft").  I've also been listening to the "Live 1975" double-disk set every day, just for the fun of it.  What does any of this have to do with anything else?  Absolutely nothing.  I just really didn't have a whole lot to talk about today.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Bob Dylan, "Love Minus Zero/No Limit"

       "Seamus--that's my dog--was outside"   I'm not much of an animal person.  Don't get me wrong; I don't go around kicking puppies or anything.  I'm not cruel to animals by any stretch of the imagination.  Just that, given the choice between having my face licked by a dog or an attractive woman, I'll take the woman every time.  What makes it all annoying is that animals really like me.  It's like they can sense I'm not an animal person, so they purposely gravitate towards me like light to a black hole.  Such was the case last night when I went for my jog.  A dog started following me while still in my neighborhood.  I tried everything short of actually kicking it to get it to go away, because I really didn't want a dog following me around campus and causing trouble.  Well, it kept following me.  Nearly got itself run over twice, too.  I was finally able to give it the slip on campus when I passed a small group of people who cooed over the dog and it stopped to get attention.  The dog either started following them or just wandered off after that, because I never saw it again (which includes not seeing it on the side of the road, for which I was thankful).  I want to be clear here, though.  I didn't wish the dog any ill-will.  My biggest concern was that it'd almost gotten itself run over twice while following me, and I didn't want that on my conscience.  I may not be an animal person, but I'm also not a cruel person, either.  It has every right to life that I do.  What annoyed me was that it was just running around my neighborhood.  It obviously belonged to someone; it had a collar but no tags.  Now it's just another stray running around a campus already overpopulated with stray animals.  The whole incident just annoyed me, though, because people kept assuming it was my dog because it was following me.  One guy yelled at me when the dog stopped following me and was seeking attention from him.  I tried to yell back that it wasn't my dog, but the guy didn't speak very good English.  Anyway, there was a reason for relating this story, I thought, though it might've just been to let everyone know that I had a frustrating experience last night.  But then I watched some anime (Sorcerer Hunters) and everything was better.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Traveling Wilburys, "Heading for the Light"

       "As I Went Out One Morning"   As I was walking to work this morning, I inexplicably started thinking about all the girls I could have had if I'd wanted them.  I know that statement sounds rather prigish and egotistical, and maybe this whole post will come across as nothing more than a ridiculously mysoginistic rant about how I'm only loved by those I don't want.  I don't really know, guess we'll just have to see.  But to return to topic: I can't really explain why I started thinking about this.  I think it all started when I downloaded an old Creedence Clearwater Revival tune last night, "Someday Never Comes."  My senior year, I met a girl (who shall remain nameless because I feel like keeping  some  things private.  Those who know her will recognize who she is, and that's fine.  The rest of you don't know her anyway, and knowing her name won't do you much good) who loved this song.  I'd actually never heard it before, though I thought I was fairly familiar with CCR (or at least with their two Greatest Hits collections, and this song was on the first one).  I'd never heard the song, but loved it.  It's taken me this long just to be able to find it to download.  So downloading that song probably got me thinking about her.  She was a nice girl, and I found her very attractive.  She had a few problems, mostly stemming from the abrupt end to her relationship with her ex-fiancee (breaking off a relationship right before you get married does that to a person, I think).  Anyway, I met her at a time when I was very, very interested in someone else (a friend of hers, actually), and had eyes for no one else, you could say.  I remember a night.  Not necessarily a pleasant night, but a night nonetheless.  Both of these girls were in a state one could call inebriated or, to be more accurate, piss drunk.  Somehow, it had fallen upon myself and a couple of other girls to take care of these two.  The girl I was interested in was completely passed out by the time I'd carried her up to her bed.  The other was not.  She was still wide awake, and in something of a state.  And she asked me why I didn't think she was good enough for me.  And I hated myself for not being able to like her, for liking someone else who would have nothing to do with me, and just for being the idiot that I am.  Time marches on, though, and she's married now and, for what I know, happy.  The other girl is engaged to be married.  Come to think of it, a lot of girls I was interested in or who were interested in me at one time or another are engaged or already married now.  I must be behind the times.  But the whole incident that night revealed a facet of my personality that I still don't fully understand.  I tend to go after the girls who are, for whatever reason, unattainable.  I don't know if I like the chase, or secretly think that I'm better than I really am, or what the deal is.  But I tend to fall for the girls who won't have me, while a perfectly wonderful girl is standing right in front of me, beating me in the head with subtle hints that they wouldn't mind going out with me.  And I never catch it, because I have no head for subtlty (note to the ladies: most men can't catch subtlty.  Be as subtle as a sledgehammer, it's your only hope to get through our thick skulls and the thicker cloud of self-interest we're usually wrapped in).  So I sit and mope, and some girl I'm totally unaware of goes unnoticed, and the girl I'm after finds some other guy.  That's the usual pattern, anyway.  There are variations, but not many.  I don't wish any of the girls ill will, though.  Even the ones who wouldn't have me.  Hell, especially them, it seems.  I have a tough time thinking ill of anyone for not wanting me.  I'm a study in contradictions: I think very highly of myself in some regards (I think I'm a decent writer, funny, and maybe even sometimes charming), but I also think I'm not very attractive physically, and that belief creates a sink hole for self-esteem that I collapse in to every time.  I think it's probably self-defeating--I don't think I'm attractive, so then I'm not attractive.  Or something like that.  I also tend to think the girls who are attracted to me could do better.  I mean, what is there about me that deserves someone who actually likes and adores me for who and what I am?  I don't have to work for anything in that sort of relationship, which is probably ultimately why it'd be dangerous for me to enter one of them.  If there's nothing for me to work for, if I don't have to earn someone's respect day after day, I'm pretty sure I'll get lazy, self-absorbed, and stop trying.  That's no good for anyone, including me, and especially her.  There have been other girls before and after that incident, but it stuck out in my mind as a sort of obvious representation of my whole situation when it comes to relationships.  Like Vizzini, it's like I won't take that which is in front of me (bonus points if you catch the movie reference).  It's probably a highly specialized form of stupidity.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Bob Dylan, "Idiot Wind"

       "With A Little Help From My Friends"   So I was discussing social group dynamics with a coworker of mine last night (yes, this is what he and I do for fun--discuss social theory and anime.  Sometimes at the same time.  He's an intellectual, and I pretend to be one, so it works).  He said he'd noticed that in social groups on college campuses that have graduate programs, a group of undergraduates will often have a "token graduate student."  He'd noticed these groups were, in general, more stable, but didn't know why.  He also didn't know why there'd be one or two grad students in a group of undergrads.  Then we figured it out, and it seemed blindingly simple--these grad students were most likely only recently graduated from their undergraduate work.  At a large institution like OU, I'm sure a high number of the people who decide to get an advanced degree remain at OU.  It makes sense--you already know the professors, you know the program and what's available, and it's just easier.  Granted, not everyone does, and sometimes you get students like me, who are from a different school.  But then again, Ozarks didn't have a graduate program (if they had, I'd have probably continued attending there).  So the token graduate student was, until recently, an undergraduate, and this was simply the group he'd been in prior to moving on to the next degree.  I know that several of the people I'm friends with were not in the same year I was at Ozarks, or even if they were, a good number of them did not graduate when I did.  Even though I went off for graduate school, I was still friends with them.  I had the unique opportunity to be the token grad student in two social groups--one at Ozarks, and one here.  In the Ozarks circle, it was usually like I'd never left when I went to visit.  It felt normal, more like I was returning home than visiting from home.  The OU circle, ont he other hand,  is composed of an old high school friend and several of the people she's introduced me to.  This new circle also includes several students who have yet to complete their undergraduate degree, but some of those are also age peers.  It's kinda weird, really.    But yeah, it all made sense when my coworker and I thought about it--why would someone abandon their social group just because they were done with their undergraduate degree?  I mean, you're isolated enough as it is as a graduate student.  You aren't on campus very much except for class or research, you take classes at different times from other students usually (all the history graduate seminar classes in the history department are at night).  It would make sense that you'd want to retain your old social group for more than the obvious reason that these people are your friends and have been for a while now.  There's the added fact that most graduate students do not socialize with one another.  I've never gone out for a beer with a fellow grad student.  Never gone over to their place just to hang out, or gone to see a movie.  We see each other in classes, perhaps in the library.  We are peers, but not friends.  It's kinda weird.  Also, I noticed a lot of the other graduate students around here are too narrow-focused, too serious in their endeavors, too concerned with becoming "professionals" to want to loosen up, relax, and even just smile.  I think I'd go insane and strangle someone if I were like that.  I need to interact with people, and while I still get to interact with my friends from Ozarks in a limited capacity, I need people I can call up and go visit without having to make long-term plans or worry about whether or not I have the whole weekend free to do so.  I need people who are close enough that we can decide to go see a movie that evening 30 minutes before it starts, not 4 1/2 or 5 hours.    That seems like a weird place to end the rambling, but I'm not sure I have anything else to add.  I guess I just consider myself lucky to be included in so many social groups, token grad student or not.  To you, my friends, I say thank you.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Counting Crows, "Einstein on the Beach"

       "Voices echo 'this is what salvation must be like after a while'"   I spent Saturday afternoon with family.  Lots of family--Clif, my parents, my paternal grandparents, great-aunt and uncle, their son and his wife, my paternal aunt and uncle, and their son and his wife and daughter.  When we have spontaneous family gatherings, we don't mess around.  I spent most of the afternoon doing one of three things--eating (lots of good food), watching football, and taking care of my cousin's daughter.  Her name's Bailey, and I think she's just over a year old.  It's been a while since there's been an infant Cottrell (if you discount my siblings and myself, who are all infantile in our own special ways), and it's an experience.  We're handfuls.  It's down to genetics, I think.  But it's been rather fun watching Bailey grow up over the past year.  I can remember when she was only a couple months old.  My cousin and his wife make a trip home about once a month (they are currently living in New Mexico, while his parents live in Midwest City, Oklahoma), so I've had the opportunity to really watch their daughter grow.  The last time I saw Bailey, she could crawl.  The time before that, she was almost crawling, and just starting to get her teeth.  Now she has her teeth, can walk, and can say a couple of words (her favorite seems to be "hi," said loudly, happily, and often.  She also likes the "sha-la-la"s in the chorus of Van Morrison's "Brown Eyed Girl," but then again, who doesnt?).  It made for a fun afternoon, really, and also made me realize something--I can't wait to have kids of my own.  I think my aunt or maybe even my mother commented on it--I'm great with kids.  They seem to be almost drawn to me, as if they recognize that here is someone who, while nominally and chronologically older, is a kindered spirit, a child at heart.  Or maybe I just have some weird affinity for them.  Whatever the reason, I like kids.  They've got this joy to them, this wonder and sense of innocence.  They see everything with fresh eyes, as if it were all totally new and totally beautiful.  I wish more adults could have that sort of vision.  So yeah, the short version is that I really want kids.  Granted, there are all sorts of obstacles--1) I don't have the time to raise a kid right now, 2) I don't have enough money to raise a kid now, and not least of all 3) I don't even have a girlfriend, let alone a wife.  I hear that sort of thing simplifies the whole child-making and having process.  Call me crazy, I'm something of a traditionalist in that regard.  It all just means I can't and won't rush into the whole thing.  I have a tough enough time taking care of just me, I can't really imagine what it'd be like trying to care for another life that is totally and completely dependant on me for survival.  On the one hand, the idea excites me.  But it also t errifies me, as I think having a child would and does anyone.  Anyone with sense, anyway.  I think the whole "need a girlfriend, then a wife" thing was especially emphasized when I proceeded to spend all evening by myself watching anime.  Which isn't to say there's anything wrong with that--I really like anime.  I like people, too, though, and would like to spend a weekend with my friends again sometime soon.  Really.  So stop hiding from me, people.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Police, "Masoko Tanga"

       "Romeo Is Bleeding"   How do you tell someone that you have feelings for them, when they seem oblivious to any subtle hints, and you're afraid being too direct will make them uncomfortable?  Seems like the sort of question you get to stop asking yourself by the time you graduate high school, right?  Well, maybe so, but I haven't really had a serious romantic relationship since high school, so I might be kind of stunted.  But honestly, what can I do?  I like this girl, a lot.  She's damn near perfect--smarter than I could ever hope to be, funny and warm and cute and interested in what I have to say, and able to make the things she talks about seem interesting, even if I have no idea what she's talking about.  And she doesn't mind my weird obsessions, like the Beatles, or anime, or videogames.  Hell, she's actually willing to partake of some of them with me, and just smiles knowingly when I mention the others (she actually thought roleplaying sounded  fun ).  I don't think I'd go so far as to say I'm in love yet--I haven't known her nearly long enough to make that sort of bold statement--but this is a girl whom I could see myself falling in love with very easily.  And I think she just sees me as that guy she hangs out with.  I keep second-guessing myself.  She probably thinks I'm some goofy-looking geek, a dork who can be a good friend, but nothing more.  But I'm already that for any number of girls; why can't she be different?  I dunno, maybe she still can be.  There's still time left in the school year, before each of us graduates from our particular degree program and heads off for parts unknown.  Between now and May, who knows what could happen?  Anything, right?  Or maybe nothing at all.  I don't honestly know, and that's probably the most exciting and nerve-wracking thing of all.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Van Morrison, "Goldfish Bowl"

       "The White Paint Plastic Saints"   I had a bizzare dream last night, and now you have to sit through me talking about it.  In the dream, I was a famous cartoonist.  There was some big thing on the internet, a sort of exposition rather like the World's Fairs of old, and I was one of fifteen people involved in it as a representative of comics.  I was, well, famous.  I woke up smiling from that dream...the fact that I was quickly frowning soon after has nothing to do with the dream and everything to do with the realization that I had to get out of bed immediately or risk being late to work.  For as long as I can remember, I've wanted to be famous, or at least moderately well known.  Doesn't really matter for what--comics, music, writing, being the first documented example of spontaneous combustion due to sexual frustration and the friction inherent therein--the reason behind the fame (or infamy, as it may be) is of little consequence.  I just like the idea that someday, I could open up my email inbox and see an email from a random person.  The email will read something like: "Hey, saw your comic/mp3/short story, really liked it.  Keep up the good work."  It doesn't have to be glowing praise.  It doesn't have to exault my name to the Heavens.  I just want recognition from someone I don't know.  It's not that my friends or family telling me they like the comic isn't good enough for me, it's just that in a way, they're almost obligated to like my comic (it's like telling your girlfriend you like her cooking, even if she can't cook).  This isn't to say they are obligated, just that they're more inclined to sugarcoat things (well, most of my friends are, anyway) and less likely to give you an honest, unbiased opinion.  Complete strangers, who don't know me and thus are not at all worried about hurting my feelings, can often give a much more honest and critical (in the objective sense of the word, not the "this sucks" sense of it) examination.  I think.  I was actually discussing with Adam the other day ways in which we could get a larger readership over at  urlLink Dim Bulb .  There are several ways--doing guest art for more established comics, paying for advertising (cost prohibitive for both of us, he because he has a fiancee, me because I'm a grad student, which is like being engaged in terms of time spent with it and the amount of money and effort I sink into it), doing link exchanges with other comics (such as we did with  urlLink The Jaded ), getting picked up by  urlLink Keenspot ,  urlLink Keenspace's  big brother, or begging for links from bigger comics.  None of them is particularly effective, and we're not likely to increase our demographic by simply cranking out strip after strip and waiting for our audience to find us.  So how do we do it?  Will we?  Or will Dim Bulb remain a small labor of love until one or both of us finally loses interest?  Hard to say.  I'd like to say that I'll keep drawing the comics whether anyone reads them or not, that I'm not in this to become famous or to even make any money off the comic (something which I've always doubted the serious possibility of anyway).  But if push came to shove, and something had to give, would the comic be it?  I really hope not.  Crooked Halo is an outlet for me, a sort of cathartic release which allows me to blow off steam over the crap that's bothering me (usually dealing with stupid people or with grad school stuff), and I feel I really need that release.  The comic is a forum for me to air my grievances with the world in general and with myself specifically, a place where I can examine humanity by examining my own issues and hang ups.  I like to think that Crooked Halo and Dim Bulb will be around for a long time, that we'll build up a cult following and a strong core readership and eventually become well-known.  Regardless, I don't plan on quitting any time soon, which probably annoys at least a couple of people.  And that's fine by me--one of the other goals of the comic is to annoy, pester, and otherwise antagonize folks.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: David Bowie, "Fame"

       "Up All Night"   I can't really explain why, but over the past few months I've developed the nasty habit of going to bed at ungodly hours.  Well after all sane human beings are sound asleep in their beds, I'm still awake, sharing the night with the goths and vampire wannabes.  I've even taken to running later at night, mostly because I can't seem to find the time to do it during the day, and because there's a smaller chance of getting run over while crossing Lindsey Street (stupid main thoroughfare through campus).    But yeah, I stay up till 2:00 or 3:00 on a regular basis, and not just on the weekends.  Which is all well and good if you can sleep in the next morning till at least 10:00 or s.  I can't--I have to wake up early every morning to get to work by 8:00.  This annoying situation is of my own design, really, and I have no one to blame but myself.  Fact is, though, rather than trying to establish a regular sleep schedule, I just take the occasional afternoon nap, which actually doesn't help me any at all and really only perpetuates the whole staying up until ungodly hours thing.  There was a point to all of this, I've just lost it.  Anyway, I can't help thinking that at the age of 23, I should probably not be doing this to myself.  But I've noticed over the past, say, four or five years, I've been staying awake later and later, sleeping less and less, and generally doing my damnedest to prevent myself from ever sleeping more than three or four hours at a time.  Unless I'm at home, and then there's really little else to do but sleep at night.  Not like anyone in my house is awake after dark.  Not like there are any people left in Shawnee I know of.  I've digressed, let me get back to my point--I'm starting to get almost  used  to so little sleep.  That's not good, at least not in the normal sense of the word.  What's going to happen is that I'm going to run up against a situation where I need to be well-rested--say, writing my Master's Thesis--and I'm not going to have a reserve of sleep to fall back on.  I'm already trying to run myself on the proverbial fumes of the gas tank; trying to make a trip cross-country on said tank is probably unwise.  But it's what I'll end up doing.  So, fair warning--in the coming month or two, if you see me, and I have a harassed, dogged, and generally bleary-eyed look about me, it's of my own doing.  But please, take pity on me--I'm a grad student, we're  supposed  to abuse ourselves.  That's what graduate school's all about.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Beatles, "I'm So Tired"

       "Steal My Heart Away"   Perhaps it's because I've been listening to a lot of Van Morrison lately, but I've been thinking an awful lot about relationships of late.  About what I want out of one, what I expect out of love and a significant other.  I think the other factor is that I keep reading Dav's Live Journal, and Lord knows that's a running theme in his.  Anyway, what do I want out of a woman?  There's the usual schtick, I guess--smart, attractive, funny, warm, generous, laughs at my jokes (not all of them, because frankly, they're not all funny), can take care of me (I need taken care of, really, and someone who can keep me organized, because I can't do it myself), etc.  It's basically the list of attributes you'll get from virtually anyone of a similar disposition.  I want someone who appreciates spontaneous romance, doesn't mind holding hands in public, but also doesn't mind a quiet evening hanging around and doing not much of anything (something I'm very fond of).  But a girl could have all those attributes and still not be right for me.  I know I've run across several women who met all or at least the greatest majority of those requirements, yet I did not want to date them.  Why?  I actually figured out the answer to this quandry just yesterday.  I want someone who is all those things, but who is most of all my equal.  I don't want someone who simply looks up to me.  I don't want to be on some pedestal (who'd be insane enough to put me on a pedestal remains to be seen).  I want a partner, an equal, someone who admires me but is not so in awe of me or what I do that she relates to me in a subordinate manner.  I'm not a dominating person, and anytime I've been in a relationship with a girl who was that submissive, it didn't work.  It drove me nuts, because I'm indecisive, a natural beta, and I can't do it.  I need someone who can make decisions for herself, who can speak up when they disagree with me, and who isn't afraid to tell me when I'm being an idiot (or isn't too blinded by some bizzare, misguided hero worship to even recognize when I'm being an ass).  I don't think it's too much to ask, but my recent dating drought might indicate otherwise.  Oh, the  urlLink Oklahoma Daily , the OU school paper, has been publishing one panel gag comics of mine for a couple of weeks now.  Just click on "Opinion," look for Staff Cartoons, and there you'll find me.  If you search the archive for "Staff Cartoon," you'll pull up all the stuff I've done for them so far.  It's just one more step on my path to world domination.  *Insert maniacal laughter and crack-boom of lightning and thunder in the background here*  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Van Morrison, "Only a Dream"

       "Sail us to the Moon"   I had this nifty rant about diversity on college campuses all written up, and I keep losing it when I try to load the post.  I keep forgetting how to work this stupid thing, so instead you're just getting a random rant about whatever I come up with.  We had an idiot in the Writing Center Friday.  Now, idiots showing up in the Center is not anything extremely out of the ordinary.  With a student-athlete population as high as OU's, there's bound to be a fair percentage of them that's dumber than a box of rocks, and just happened to make it into college because they could play a sport (probably football).  Well, this guy was an idiot for new reasons.  See, we have recruitment tours that come through the place every so often.  It impresses the parents of prospective student-athletes to see the academic services center we have here at OU (which is deservedly impressive--the folks who work here, and I'm not just talking about the Writing Center, are quiet good at what they do).  Anyway, this moron decides to announce to a tour that we have written papers  for  him.  This is patently absurd--we don't write the papers for students.  So it reflects poorly upon us, and I don't like that sort of thing.  Now we are even more limited in how we can edit the papers, because any stuff we were doing that might be considered borderline cheating (such as suggesting words to replace for crappy word choice, something we do quite a bit) we can no longer do.  All because one idiot thought he was being funny.  In reality, he only hurt himself and us.  On top of that, we then had to have a meeting with our boss about this crap, and that was unnecessary, really, or should have been.  I swear, it only takes one fool to reflect poorly upon all student-atheltes.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Radiohead, "2 + 2 = 5"

       "Call me up in dreamland"   Huzzah for research, y'know?  It's virtually all I've done today--research for my Master's Thesis, or research for my 19th Century Europe paper.  It seems like that's all historians do sometimes is dig through archives and look for that one single, solitary source that will make or break their work, that will clench their position in the pantheon of great historians whose names are mentioned with awe, admiration, and great respect.  You will never find the name Stephen Ambrose among those names, I can guarantee it.  Ambrose was the devil, plain and simple, because he pretended to be a historian when he was really just a plagiarist.  But damn, he was a popular one.  Really, I could have dealt with his crap if it weren't for the fact that the uneducated masses usually saw him as the representative of the historical profession.  Most historians just saw him as an ass.  I wouldn't mind being as popluar as he was, though.  Granted, I think there's probably very little chance of that.  Too limited an interest group for early modern British cultural and religious history.  Ah well.  That's why I do the comics and writing and songs.  I want to be famous, or at least moderately well-known, to the point where someone might send me a random email or something saying, "hey, I saw your comic/short story/mp3, and thought it was great!"  That's really my goal, I think.  On a slightly related note, go check out  urlLink The Jaded , a very nifty webcomic by a wonderful young lady named Ping.  It's a very well-done comic art and story-wise, and she's also one of the nicest random people I've ever met.  She's actually helping us out with the archives at the Dim Bulb site, and not because she expects anything in return...at least, she hasn't asked for anything in return...  Oh, and this is the fourth time I've written out this damn post.  If it doesn't work this time, to hell with it.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Van Morrison, "Wonderful Remark"

       "Shout out these songs against the clang of electric guitars"   I've been dealing with graduate school applications and related things for the past week.  There's nothing particularly difficult about any of it, and I really should have done this stuff a month or two ago when I said I would.  But part of my nature is to put off doing what needs to be done so I can do what I would rather do; i.e., nothing.  But the applications got me thinking.  Originally, I was going to have my Master's degree finished by December.  That date has now been pushed back till May.  Why the delay?  Well, partly because none of the schools I want to attend accept students in the spring semester.  Another reason is that I've been putting off doing the stuff related to finishing this degree and getting applications for the next school done.  But mostly it's because I don't want to leave.  Now, I know the idea of anyone not wanting to leave Oklahoma seems astounding.  Really, it has less to do with the fact that it's Oklahoma, and more to do with what I have to leave here.  I'll have to leave comfort and familiarity for isolation and the unknown.  To be frank, going someplace I've never been before scares the hell out of me.  Washington University in St. Louis might not be too bad, and Union-PSCE in Richmond would put me within striking distance of DC and thus Wendy and the East Coast Crew, but I know no one at either Ohio State or Wisconsin.  Out of the four schools I'm looking at, only one puts me anywhere close to someone I know.  But here...here, I've just started finally finding people.  I've found old friends and new ones alike, and I'm not ready to leave them.  I hated leaving Ozarks; after four years, I'd bonded with my friends there so much that the act of leaving actually caused some sort of mental breakdown which I only fixed by spending the entire summer in the beautiful surroundings of Yellowstone National Park (it's amazing how peaceful and restful mountains can be to someone from one of the flat states).  I haven't been here as long as I was Ozarks, and I don't know as many people, but I'm no more inclined to want to leave them than I was last time.  The thing is, it's almost like the decision is being taken from me.  Most of my friends from Ozarks have already been cast to the four winds, heading out for points known but very, very distant (my roommate and his wife, arguably two of my very closest friends, are in Seattle, WA, of all places, and as mentioned before, Wendy--my absolute best friend--is in DC).  I almost don't feel I'm equipped for all these partings, though people (mostly my mother) keep telling me that that's the nature of life--people come and go.  Well, I don't want it to be like that.  I want to stay in close contact.  I want to be able to still walk across the hall to see my closest friends, to be able to holler across the room at my roommate and then all of us gather in the living room to play video games.  I want college to last forever, or at least the communal aspects of it.  I think it all boils down to my ideal place: it would be somewhere where I could stay with all of my friends, some sort of big house or dorm-type building where we could all stay, interacting and laughing and loving.  It'd be something of a heaven, really, though I know that term is thrown around a lot.  And the saddest thing is, I realize I can't ever have a place like that.  The nature of life  is  that people move on and away.  We can't stop them, we can't freeze time at this single moment and make it last forever.  We can only cherish the moments and times we do have with those people who make living worthwhile.  That's what I want to do, and I accept that nothing will last forever, but I just want to make this moment last a bit longer is all.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Flaming Lips, "Fight Test"

      Hey all, and welcome to an experiment.  An experiment in what, you ask rhetorically?  Or maybe you don't, I don't know.  This is a chance for me to ramble.  That's really about the extent of it.  I wanted someplace with more freedom and flexibility than my rantspace over at  urlLink Dim Bulb , because though the rant space is fun, it's very difficult to edit it on the fly.  This seems like it'll be easier, and maybe Adam won't accidentally delete my posts here :).  The other thing about the blog as opposed to the rant space is freedom of topic and tone.  At Dim Bulb, I feel that I have to be funny, or at least vaguely entertaining.  I don't feel such an obligation here.  I think I can have the chance to be more...complete, more realistic.  Admittedly, what is written here will still be shaped by the fact that I'm aware I have an audience.  That's sort of how things work--I have this need to perform, but I don't want to be pigeonholed as a one-note joke, as it were.    So anyway, this'll be a chance for me to more fully express myself.  Besides, everyone else seems to find these things so bloody fascinating, I thought I'd give it a shot (we mostly have Dav to blame for it, honest, though I doubt I'll be anywhere near as eloquent or profound as his Live Journal is).  Maybe you'll enjoy this, maybe you won't.  I don't know, and don't honestly care that much.  This is for me; you just get to peek in.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Counting Crows, "Mrs. Potter's Lullaby"

       "Stupid Headphones"   My damn headphones died today, and man I'm pissed.  I mean, these things aren't that old.  Maybe a year, tops.  They should still work just fine.  But no--the right ear doesn't work anymore.  No sound.  Now I'm gonna have to go out and buy new freakin' headphones.  All this so I can walk to and from work and sit at work with music.  Lord, I'm pathetic.    And now I'm catching shit from a wrestler, a man who has trouble spelling his own name (he has trouble spelling most anything, for that matte,r but that's hardly the point).  Why?  Because running five miles was difficult for me.  Anyone who knows me knows I'm not the most athletic person in the world.  Hell, I'm not the most athletic person in my family.  But I'm really not about to take shit from a freshman, especially one who's getting everything virtually handed to him.  I'd say something snide to him, but he wouldn't understand any of it.  Anyway, so now I'm in a rather annoyed mood, and there's nothing I can really do about it (short of beating the holy hell out of the freshman, which I can't do--not because I'll get fired, but because he could probably kick my ass).  Blarg.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: None, because my damn headphones are broken.

       "Lazy Days"   Today was a day to do nothing, and that's exactly what I did--nothing.  I didn't achieve anything of any merit or value, except beating an area in Golden Sun (a nifty GameBoy Advance game I picked up the other day, and have been enjoying immensely--I'm getting my RPG on, 'kay?).  Funny thing is, this would normally annoy me on some base level, but today, it doesn't.  I'm not sure why, I'm just not really worried.  Guess I needed a day off or something.  Anyway, there really isn't much to talk about.  Tomorrow, I have to return to the proverbial grind, get back to work and all that.  Blah.  I've enjoyed the extended break (Wednesday through today is pretty nice, after all), but it'll be nice to have something to do and to see people (the only day I've seen people since this break started was Thursday, and they were mostly family).  On an unrelated note, my father and I decided to run in a 5K race they're having up at Lake Hefner (where we ran the 8K on Thanksgiving) next weekend.  Five kilometers--a little over three miles--I can handle, because that's what I run every day.  And after putting my body through the hell of running about 5 miles, 3 will seem like a walk in the park...er, jog, I mean.  Whatever.  I'm gonna go play more Golden Sun.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Barenaked Ladies, "Shoe Box"

       "Putting Flesh On The Bones Of My Dreams"   Historians, as a general rule, are ill-equipped to deal with the present.  Dreams, as another general rule, are equally ill-equipped to deal with the present; and with reality, for that matter.  The former thinks mostly about the past; the latter, about the future and the what could be.  I'm a historian and a dream, therefore, I'm uniquely designed to think about everything except for this moment right now.  Which is rather amusing, really, considering I usually advocate a philosophy of "live for the moment."  It's one that I try to follow, but I also constantly think about what was and what could be.  I'm a study in contradictions, I guess.  The way I think about the past is probably not unique.  I have a certain amount of nostalgia for that which went before.  I'm more enamoured of the music that was made before I was born than I am of the crap they've got on the radio today.  I'm fascinated by the way politics and religion and philosophy worked in the distant past, back when what one believed was more important than money.  I also think of the past in more personal terms, recalling the joys and sorrows I've shared with those I love over the years.  I long for those moments from the past, to relive particular days, or hours, or even minutes of such pure bliss that the rest of the world ceased to exist as far as I was concerned.  I remember first kisses, telling someone I loved them for the first time, the laughter of a friend as I changed their bad day into a good one.  I remember the tears I shared with friends over loss, heartache, suffering, and just the random stupidity of life and an uncaring, random world.  Yes, my musings on the past are rather wistful, and just a touch bittersweet.  Sweet because so many of my memories are good ones, and so much of the more general history I've studied academically is interesting and fascinating to me.  Bitter because I know the personal memories are just memories, and I cannot relive them again, even if I am with those people once more.  No, time marches on, of course, and nothing I can do--especially wishing--will change that.  Also bitter to think that so many of the stupid mistakes our ancestors made are repeated on a daily basis, because we didn't study what came before us and thus cannot understand that these conflicts we keep fighting are not going to be resolved with a show of force and a taste of steel.  The way I think about the future is maybe a bit odder, though even it is probably not unique to me.  I am, as I said, a dream.  I dream of what could be, of what will never be, of things real and imagined.  I dream of the day when I become a professor in history, or even of the day an acceptance letter comes from one of the schools I applied to arrives in the mail.  I dream of finding the right girl, of discovering we are right for each other, marrying, and living the cliched "happily ever after" that can only exist in a dream but never in reality, because everyone has to face a bumpy road.  And I dream that maybe I've already met her, that we're just waiting for that right moment in time to realize that we're meant for each other.  It's hard to say.  Funny thing is, I have a tough time acting in the present to enable me to realize my future, my dreams.  I keep thinking it'd be nice to be accepted to a great school for my PhD, but I've been putting off filling out applications.  I only finished off everything for another of them this afternoon, and it only took ten minutes to fill out the form, and a quick trip to the Post Office to send everything off.  So why am I so hesitant, so lazy?  It's not as though I was filling the rest of my time with excitement or important tasks that could only be done at that very moment.  Why can't I connect the past, the present, and the future altogether into one tread of chronology, and recognize that things which were done then have an effect on now, and things done now have an effect later?  Why are the three moments disconnected in my mind?  The past is easy enough to understand.  They say it's like a foreign country, a distant land which no one can visit.  Makes sense.  But why do I have such a difficult time accepting the fact that the things I want to do later require activity now?  I think it's because I'm a terrible planner, and I also expect things to just happen for me.  Life doesn't work like that, though.  It's really a good example of just how naive and sheltered I've been, though.  I realize on an intellectual level that I have to do things now to enjoy the benefits later, but a small part of me (a part which has a disproportionate control over my decision making to its size) keeps thinking everything will be literally handed to me.  That someone will see my comics, and suddenly I'll be famous and loved by many, that all sorts of folks will want to read them and give me money to keep making them.  Or that someone will hear Clif and I's music and give us a record contract, and we'll become the next Beatles.  Or I'll write some short story that gets me a big publishing deal and I'll be able to be a professional writer.  Not to discount those dreams: it'd be great to be a cartoonist, or writer, or rock star.  I would love any of them, and I do keep all three up with some sort of far-fetched hope that someday it'll pay off in more than just an artistic expression of ideas running around in my head, that someone else will appreciate them like I do and feel I deserve some sort of monetary compensation for all my hard work (yes, I want to sell out--but hey, saying you're doing it for the sake of the song is great, and I fully agree with it, but would you rather make music no one ever hears, or make music loved by millions and which makes you lots and lots of money, assuming it doesn't force you to abandon your artistic principles?  C'mon, I'm not a punk, I don't believe I lose credibility just because I make art that people  like ).  I think what it boils down to is that I do want things given to me, I don't want to have to work hard for them.  This is a huge personal defect, a gaping hole in an otherwise not too bad personality (wow, I think that still came out conceited).  I  can  work hard, I just don't like to without the certainty of success at the end.  I don't want to have to fill out applications to graduate schools without the assurance that I'll not only be accepted to the school, but I'll get a scholarship and I'll be able to get gainful employment upon graduation.    Perhaps another example is in order--exercise.  I hate to exercise, because I don't get immediate results.  It takes a long time for any visible result to manifest itself.  I mean, I run and run, and don't lose weight very quickly, if at all (though that's in part due to my eating habits, but that's another story).  I know there are many long-term benefits to exercising, I just don't see any immediate ones.  I hurt, I sweat, and I'm not noticeably thinner at the end of the workout.  So what's the bloody point?  It's why I lose interest in things like that (or like playing the guitar, which I've tried several times) so quickly--nothing tangible comes of it immediately, so why bother?  As I said, this is a pretty big problem, and one I struggle with every moment of every day in some form or another.  It could be that part of my problem is that I'm the product of a society which places such emphasis and importance on instant gratification, on the fulfillment of base desires right now.  But that's just a cop out, really.  If I'm truly interested in something, I should put forth the damn effort to achieve it, whether my effort is immediately rewarded or not.  I have to be in this for the long haul, I have to make this moment mean something not only for now, but for later.  I have to try, because dammit, what's the point in living for the moment if my moments on down the road are going to be empty, painful, and without purpose?  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: David Gray, "Flesh"

       "Going The Distance"   Well, the Thanksgiving run was a success.   I completed the run, and in under an hour as I'd hoped.  I think my time was just over 54 minutes, which isn't too bad.  It would have been better, except my shoe kept coming untied.  Every time I had to stop to tie my shoes, my legs would go dead, and I'd have to walk a bit.  I could have finished in under 50 if I hadn't had to keep doing that.  Ah well--at least I finished.  Five miles is the fartherest I've ever run, even if it was sort of in fits and starts.  The rest of Thanksgiving was pretty darn spiffy, too.  Beth came over to my folks' place for dinner, and my grandfather managed not to tell any embarrassing childhood stories.  And the food...Lord, the food was great.  As predicted, I completely canceled out the five mile run.  Oh well--I'm allowed to indulge occasionally (the problem being, of course, I tend to indulge regardless and much too often, but that's a different story, really).  I've spent a good part of the evening feeling meloncholy, but I think I know why.  I was watching a Paul McCartney Live DVD, and it occurred to me that I'll never get the chance to hear the Beatles live.  It saddens me to think that this great music--arguably some of the best ever, regardless of your musical taste--is not something I can experience first hand for the most part.  Oh, I can listen to the CDs, and I can go to the Tribute--1964 concerts, and there's even a good chance that I'll score McCartney tickets the next time he's anywhere near me (I'll even kill for them, if need be--I will not be denied a second time).  But...it just won't be the same.  Though I obviously never knew them personally, the absence of Lennon and Harrison leaves a big hole in my life, it feels like.    That probably sounds a bit hokey, and the next statement will sound even moreso: the music these men created connected to me on a deeply personal level that I cannot even begin to describe.  It's as though the Beatles tapped into a deep reservoir of the human spirit and conveyed it to the masses via sound.  Equisite, emotive, melodic sound capable of making you experience the whole gamut of human emotions and feelings from happiness, euphoria, and pure joy to saddness so deep and infinite and gut-wrenching that you can't even begin to understand how someone who's experienced the pain they're describing could go on living.  This all sounds rather like hyperbole, I'm sure, but come on--how many people out there honestly don't know the chorus to "Hey Jude," or the tune of "Yesterday?"  In fact, I'd be willing to say that "Yesterday" is arguably the finest song ever written, regardless of genre, tastes, or styles.  It is a simple, evocative melody that clearly conveys loss, despair, and longing on such a personal level that you can't help but feel for the narrator.  And McCartney's vocals are absolutely perfect--just the right pitch and tone to express the sentiment without sounding too whiney, or too tough, or too anything.  It just  fits .  And the whole thing started out as a tune that had the words "scrambled eggs" as a placeholder for the title and lyrics.  Pretty crazy, huh?  But yeah, I'm really rather sad that I'll never get to see the Beatles play live.  Admittedly, few people did get to, as they only played live shows for such a brief period of time.  But even so...that doesn't make it any easier to bear; rather, it seems to make everything more tragic.  The other thing watching the McCartney DVD made me realize is that he is a tunesmith, but not much of a lyricist.  Don't get me wrong--McCartney turned out some very memorable songs with some great lyrics.  The aforementioned "Yesterday" comes to mind; and he can crank out a love song that sounds better than anyone else out there, let me tell you.  The man has an uncanny knack for writing infectiously catchy pop songs, but his lyrics seem to be an afterthought, tacked on at the end when he realizes, "oh, I need more than just a pretty tune."  I'm usually lean more on lyrics than on tune when I listen to music, though I can forgive a slight deficiency in one or the other if its opposite happens to be very strong (for example, I can forgive weaker lyrics if the tune is really, really good, or I can forgive a so-so song if the lyrics are amazing.  How else do you explain my love of Dylan?).  It all just makes me wish I could write McCartney's lyrics for him.  Between the two of us, there would be nothing we couldn't do.  I mean, he can still write songs that are amazing, he just seems to have run the well dry when it comes to lyrics.  If I wrote his lyrics for him, he'd be gold.  Not to mention the fact that he can sing them better than I ever could.  So yeah, if anyone out there happens to be buddy-buddy with Sir Paul McCartney, tell him I'd be more than happy to be his lyricist, and I would work cheap (hell, for the opportunity to join him on tour and to just be around him, I'm pretty certain I'd work for free, or even pay him).  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Beatles, "Yesterday"

       "Films About Ghosts"   So it's been a long day, I do believe.  Got up at 4:00 this morning to take my friend Dominic to the airport.  Then I went back to bed, because hey, I may be a nice guy, but I'm also a sleepy guy, and when my youngest sibling calls at 1:30am, right as I'm falling asleep, and causes me to only get like two hours of sleep total, I'm damn well gonna go back to bed and catch up.  Beyond that, the day was spent doing research and running errands.  Tomorrow will be spent running (morning) and eating more turkey than is really recommended for continued health.  And mashed potatoes and gravy.  And stuffing.  And bread, of whatever variety (mom will fix rolls, and Beth said she was gonna bring some cheese bread because she felt back about not contributing.  Who am I to stop her?).  And let us also not forget the wonder of pie.  Mmm, pie.  Yes, it's a good thing I'm running five miles tomorrow morning.  As it stands, I'll probably have to run five more after dinner just to cut my loses and come out even on the day.  So it goes.  Only in America could we invent an entire holiday designed to enshrine gluttony and the oppression of ethnic minorities through privatization of land and lots of diseases.  Huzzah for the measles and cholera.  Despite the slightly cynical nature of the preceeding paragraph, I do rather enjoy Thanksgiving.  I'm not sure I could even begin to ennumerate all the things I'm thankful for.  I guess, in no particular order, the big ones would be: I'm thankful for my friends and family (that one is #1, regardless); having a roof over my head and food to eat; not having to worry about whether or not I'll starve tomorrow; living in a country where, though I disagree vehemently with some of the government's policies and dislike our leader immensely, I have a right and a freedom to do so; I'm thankful for my talents and skills, meager though they be, and for the joy I think they bring to others' lives; and I'm thankful for the joy others bring to my life on a daily basis.  I'm also thankful for good music, anime, and movies.  And the Dhali Llama, because he rocks.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Counting Crows, "Friend of the Devil"

       "But I Can Rock As Good As Gibraltar"   Paper writing is an interesting process for me.  On the one hand, I need to be able to sit and do it for prolonged periods of time.  That's how I write best--in large, open blocks.  On the other hand, I'm easily distracted, and I get bored with just writing real fast.  But I can't write if I'm busy doing other stuff.  For instance, yesterday was a terrible day for my writing.  I sat down here at work to start writing my paper, and got about a paragraph or two into it.  I was just starting to feel the ol' writing flow, when a student comes in with a paper for me to look at.  So I look at the paper, and return to my own.  Well, I've lost the thread, so I have to pick it back up (this sounds an awful lot like knitting, now that I think about it).  But I'd get another paragraph or two into the paper, and I'd be interrupted again by a student who needed a paper proofread.  This happened like three times during the course of the morning.  By 11:00am, I'd given up on getting anything accomplished at work.  When I went home that afternoon, I didn't get much more accomplished, because I hadn't been able to establish a groove, a rhythm in which to write.  And the way I write, I have to be in the mood for it.  I can't just start papers two weeks early just because that's easier; I can only start a paper early if I have inspiration for it.  All that being said, I also discovered I don't have enough research to complete the paper.  Need a few more books, really, so I have to make a trip to the library this afternoon to attempt to find said books.  Because y'know, I didn't like being able to see my desk and the floor around it.  No, the piles of books look much better.  I'm finding it harder and harder to wake up in the morning.  That might have something to do with staying up late at night so often, but that could just be mere conjecture.    Blarg.  It's now 9:30am, and I really should have started writing about an hour ago on this damn paper.  Why is nothing getting done?  Because I'm a lazy sonuvabitch, that's why.  Ah well, off for adventure and excitement in the land of history.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: George Harrison, "Wreck of the Hesperus"

       "This Place Won't Speak Its Language To Me"   Excitement!  Adventure!  Really wild things!  I've experienced none of these of late, but that's okay.  Life doesn't always have to be drama, honest.  The weekend didn't go exactly as planned.  For starters, I didn't get to play racquetball Friday.  Why not, you ask?  Well, seems that in order to play racquetball at the OU Fitness Center, you not only have to have a racquet and balls, but you have to have the stupid goggles.  For some sort of insurance purpose, they say.  Bollucks to that, I say.  If I want to put out my own damn eyes when playing racquetball, then by God, I'll put out my own damn eyes!  So instead I went for a run.  Dominic ran with me (at the nice indoor track they have at the Fitness Center), which meant we ran faster than I usually manage (about an 8 to 8 1/2 minute mile pace, whereas I usually go about 9 to 9 1/2 per mile for distance running), but I made him run farther than he's used to.  So it all evened out in the end.  Friday night, Jess, Dom, and I actually ate (and enjoyed!) Chinese food.  For me, this was the first time in a long while.  I'm not a big fan of Chinese food, thanks entirely to a nasty episode of food poisoning back in high school, but I've come to the point where I can usually tolerate it once in a while.  This was actually good, even, and I always enjoy the chance to try a different take on curry (I love me some curry!).  After Chinese, we went and saw the movie  Secondhand Lions .  Had Michael Caine and Robert Duvall, as well as a slightly grown-up Halley Joel Osment (the "I see dead people" boy).  All turned in a great performance, and I must say I laughed for most of the movie.  It was just so warm and colorful, the sort of live-action movie Disney used to be able to make but seems to have forgotten how (think original Parent Trap).  Saturday was spent researching and watching anime.  Ev has now seen the second DVD of Blue Seed, and I think he's enjoying the experience.  He keeps going on about how he's enjoying it, anyway, so I guess he's telling me the truth and not just saying stuff to keep from hurting my feelings.  Sunday was more research, a sore knee (still not sure what was wrong, but it doesn't really hurt now, so I'm not going to worry about it), and really freakin' cold.  Like,  damn .  It went from 70 to 25 in the space of like 12 hours.  Ah, the glory of living in Oklahoma, land of inconsistant weather patterns!  Looks like I'm going to try and spend part of Finals Week at Ozarks, because Mr. Vander Leest is rumored to be returning to this area of the country.  I originally thought that OU's finals week was the week before Ozarks's, but this later proved to be false.  That's okay, though--I only have one "final," and it's really just turning in a paper, watching a film, and eating a meal with the rest of the class (all one other student and the professor).  I also think it actually occurs before finals week, so I figure if I work a couple of days (need money, need money for rent and such, since I won't work all of the rest of December), then head over to ol' Arkansas to visit with folks.  Well, off to work on my paper more.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Toad the Wet Sprocket, "So Alive"

       "Fascination With Failure"   I'm in the middle of working on a paper for my 19th Century Europe class about the Chartist Movement.  I know none of you care two bits about history, so I'll be brief, because this stuff is sorta necessary to understand the rambling which follows.  See, the Chartists were a group of working class boys who got together and demanded political change in the 1830s.  They failed.  Miserably.  They had six points they wanted to see implimented in Parliament, and got none of them.  Mind you, five of the six eventually did get passed (they never got annual elections), though not by the Chartists and not for a few decades at the least.  But Chartism itself failed completely.  Anything on their agenda that was passed wasn't passed because of them.  Funny thing is, historians are fascinated with this movement.  This  failed  movement.  Why, I've been wondering?  Is it because they shouldn't have failed?  Is it because this movement formed the basis for the Marxist interpretation of how proletariat revolutionary movements ought to be organized?  Is it because Chartism paved the way for every single working class political movement that followed in England?  Or maybe because their goals were eventually realized, even if not by them?  Actually, I think it's a combination of these and probably much, much more.  But that's really not the point.  The point is that historians are obsessed with this failure, with this movement that petered out because the working class got some social improvements (better wages, shorter hours, etc.) and completely lost interest in politics.  History is supposedly written by and for the victors, so why do we care about the losers in this case?  Really, my whole life has been caring about the losers.  Well, it's been about casting myself as that proverbial loser, as the martyr who sacrifices his own needs and wants to the greater good.  I'm like a Utilitarian, allowing my own happiness to be superceded by the overall greater happiness of the group.  All very noble and crap, but why do I allow myself to wallow in my failures so much?  Because I do--I am fascinated with my own failures, allowing them to consume me, especially the failures in the romance department.  Like the historians who keep writing about Chartism and its impact more than a century and a half after it stopped being relevant, I keep thinking about and dwelling on the wrong turns I've made in my love life over the past five or six years.  And there have been many, let me tell you.  But why does any of that matter?  Why do I keep thinking about the girl who said "no" my freshman year of college (sorry, girls, plural), or sophomore year, or junior or senior year?  Shouldn't it all be water under the proverbial bridge by now?  I mean, hell, it wasn't as if any of them were serious prospects, right?  Not like I wanted a long-term relationship with them or anything.  Okay, that last bit is a lie, and probably the reason I keep dwelling on this crap.  I  did  want a long-term relationship.  In the worst possible way.  But it never happened.  Why?  There were a few girls (three, maybe four or five) who would have thrown themselves at me sans clothing if I'd wanted them to.  But those were never the girls I wanted, were they?  No, I had to go after the ones who weren't interested in a relationship, or who liked me as a friend, or who thought that God hadn't designated me as "the one" even though they might have feelings for me anyway (which I always thought of as maybe God's subtle way of cluing them in.  I dunno, I've always been an advocate of God giving you common sense so that you could use it.   That's  how God tells you things, not by miraculous brilliant flashes of inspiration).  See, years later, though I feel no animosity toward the girls who said such things, I still dwell on their words.   Why ?  It makes less than no sense, really.  It's like I'm incapable of moving on with my life, incapable of accepting that these girls were not interested in me the way I was interested in them.  I'm not sure how to deal with this, actually.  I'm not sure how to tell the girls I'm interested in that I'm interested in them, or the girls I'm not interested in that I'm not interested in them.  Like the historians of Chartism, I'm too busy focusing on the failures to see anything else.  I've got bloody tunnel vision.    There's probably some sort of cosmic lesson buried in this.  I'm probably supposed to learn to let the past be the past, to recognize when it's time to move on and accept things.  But that can be damned for all I care.  I like dwelling in the past; hell, I  majored  in it.  And I can't help thinking of the things that could have been had one of those girls said "yes" instead of "no," just as the historians can't help asking "what if the Chartists had succeeded?"  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Toad the Wet Sprocket, "Hobbit on the Rocks"

       "Videogames Don't Kill People"   I was reading an article linked from the weblog of a popular webcomic author earlier, and it got me thinking.  The article basically said that videogames were training kids to be killers.  His basic argument was such: it desensitizes kids to violence.  It makes the vicitms of violence seem less human, unreal. And videogames are simulations, not spectator entertainment like a violent movie.  Ultimately, the article claimed that children were learning to be killers by playing videogames.  The idea is ludicrous, I say.  I've been playing videogames for a good fifteen years, probably.  Ever since the original eight-bit Nintendo Entertainment System came out, I've been grabbing for the controller and immersing myself in digital fun.  I don't think I've killed anyone yet because of any of the games I've played, and I've played some rather violent games (including good ol' Halo and the Grand Theft Auto games).  Blaming videogames for youth violence is absurd.  Adults are trying to use videogames as a scapegoat, a patsy to take the fall because parents and communities have not been doing their job and teaching children right from wrong.  I don't see that videogames desensitize anyone to violence anymore than cartoons, movies, or even the evening news anymore.  The thing is, though, parents and other adults don't give kids enough credit--most kids know the difference between fantasy and reality, between fake and real.  They recognize that the Coyote who just got smashed in the head with the anvil is different from dropping something heavy on little brother's head.  Little brother is not going to end up in a humorous accordian shape making the noise of such an instrument.  Kids know this, just like they know that videogames are not real.  Admittedly, some kids do not recognize a difference between real and make-believe.  If that is the case, then it's the responsibility of the parents to teach the kids the difference.  The real problem isn't that kids are learning bad things from videogames or TV or whatever, it's that no one is bothering to teach kids right from wrong, real from make-believe.  Everyone assumes it's someone else's responsibility.  Parents pass the buck to teachers, who pass the buck to societal role models like celebrities and the like (who are actually the worst people to pass the responsibility to--actors, musicians, and sports stars live lives that are very different from that 99.9999% of all kids will lead, and celebrities are really living in a sort of make-believe world of their own).  This sort of thing has to stop, or kids will keep finding their father's gun and going off to pop the proverbial caps in the students back at school who made fun of them.  The other big flaw in the argument is that videogames train kids to be killers.  How so?  Let's look at a popular game, Halo.  In Halo, there are five ways for a character to die--he can be shot repeatedly, until his shield and health are all gone.  He can fall, either into a pit or too far onto the floor.  He can be smacked in the back of the head with the butt of a weapon.  Or he can be grenaded.  Or run over by a vehicle.  Now, how many of the aforementioned methods are likely to occur in your standard suburban environment?  I don't know where to get hold of grenades.  I don't have any automatic weapons, sniper rifles, or rocket launchers.  Not too many bottomless pits around, and most folks realize that if you fall from a certain height, you're at least guaranteed broken bones.  Sure, you can get run over, or hit in the back of the head, but you could get run over by someone who hasn't been playing videogames just as easily as by someone who hasn't.  Most of the folks who have road rage probably don't play videogames.  As for getting hit in the back of the head, how often do you walk up behind someone and smack them in the back of the head with the butt of your weapon?  Oh, wait, you don't have a weapon?  Oops.  So the likelihood of dying in the Halo ways are slim.  But what of the "training to be killers" thing?  Well, how does one manipulate a character in a videogame, Halo or otherwise?  By means of the controller.  If I want to shoot someone, I push the B button or whatever.  To aim, I move a joystick.  To jump, I push another button.  I don't actually commit any of these acts of violence myself, I manipulate a controller which causes things to happen on screen.  Does anyone believe that guns are really manipulated by a controller in real life?  If so, you've apparently got some really advanced weaponry I don't know about.  The gist of it all is this--the idea that videogames alone cause kids to be violent is bunk.  Complete, total bunk.  Videogames may glorify violence, but so do movies, the news, and damn near everything else you come across anymore.  Our heroes on the big screen?  Killers, every last one of them.  I love the Lord of the Rings, but look at Two Towers.  They make a joke out of seeing whether the elf or the dwarf kills more enemies.  They turn death into a statistic, much as the news does.  "Such and such number of people have died in such another city this month," or whatever statistic you choose.  It's ridiculous--videogames are no more responsible for violence in youth than angsty music.  Teenagers might be more susceptible to influences, since they're at an impressionable age, but it's still a parent's responsibility to teach kids right from wrong.  I knew the differences between right and wrong, real and fake, and so do other kids.  Stop using videogames as a scapegoat.  You might as well say that listening to rock and roll leads to devil worship.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Toad the Wet Sprocket, "Comes a Time"

       "Grammar Nazi"   I'm not sure when it happened, or even really why it happened, but somewhere along the way I became a grammar and spelling nazi.  Not that I'm goose-stepping around the place, shouting at people who abuse the English language with some sort of faux-German accent.  No, I just get exceptionally annoyed at people who make very basic errors.  Y'know, the sort of errors you're supposed to stop making when you're in like the third grade, because they actually teach you how to write proper English.  I see it on a daily basis at work.  Admittedly, some of the athletes are from foreign countries, and don't speak English very well.  That, I can handle.  English is a hard langauge to learn if you're not native to it.  But native speakers (i.e., anyone in Britain or most of North America, including the United States and Canada) have no excuse.  I've actually seen people use the phrase "we was" in a paper.  Honestly.  It sickens me--it's called noun-verb agreement, folks.  The noun and the verb have to have the same singular/plural setting; that is, if the noun is plural, as the word "we" is, then the verb has to be plural as well.  Some folks just don't seem to get it.  Or basic spelling.  Honestly, when did you learn to spell the word "writing?"   Did  you learn?  I honestly think some people didn't.  I've actually seen it spelt "writeing."  English Spelling 101: you don't just add the "ing" to a word that ends in "e," you have to drop the "e" first.  And homophones--just because words sound the same does not mean they have interchangeable meanings!  "There" is not the same as "their" or "they're;" "your" and "you're" have separate meanings; "too," "two," and "to" are all different words!  You've no idea how many papers I see  daily  that make these mistakes.   Constantly .  I'm pretty sure that when I was in elementary and junior high, I was taught proper spelling and grammar.  Surely they still teach that in school?  I mean, I know the quality of education has decreased a bit, but that much in just the few short years that separate me from undergraduates?  I doubt it.  Clif and Scott, both undergrads themselves, seem fully capable of forming coherent, grammatically correct sentences.  So why can't anyone else?  What's worse is the way that the internet has caused language skills to deteriorate.  Remember when we actually had some sort of punctuation at the end of a sentence?  Well, instant messenger programs seem to be killing punctuation and capitalization.  I've even noticed myself doing it when using messenger programs--whenever I reach a place when I would use a period, I usually just hit enter and count that as a full stop.  While this does work, to an extent, it still annoys me that I've gotten too lazy to actually hit one more key to make a letter a capital or to add a period to the end of a sentence.  And what the hell is with netspeak slang?  I know people who actually think that crap is cool or clever.  I thought L33+ was cool the first time I saw it on [url=http://www.megatokyo.com]Megatokyo[/url].  That was three years ago, and I know for a fact (from reading rants on the website) that Piro, the artist for said glorious comic, blames himself for the proliferation of that perversion of the English language.  A hint to all you "l33+ |-|@xx0r5" out there--you sound like an idiot epileptic monkey.  Stop it.  I swear, leaving language in the hands of today's youth is like handing a priceless vase to an infant: it's gonna get broken, and what you end up with won't be language or a vase, but something shattered, a thousand tiny fragments that no longer form anything coherent or worthwhile.  We'll end up with something far worse than Ebonics or Esperanto--we'll end up with shitty English.  Really shitty English.  I, for one, am going to fight to my last breath to defend language that makes sense.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Toad the Wet Sprocket, "Dam Would Break"

       "Kickin' Through The Autumn Leaves"   Hard to believe it's already late November.  No, honestly--it's still getting up in the mid-70s every day.  It's nigh impossible to believe that it'll be officially Winter in a month.  Supposedly some colder weather is coming through this weekend, but that doesn't necessarily mean it'll be cold still this time next week.  Also doesn't guarantee that it won't have snowed by this time next week.  That's always been the thing about Oklahoma weather--it changes at the drop of the proverbial hat.  Anyway, exciting weekend lined up.  Going to play racquetball with Dominic this afternoon.  I haven't played racquetball since April or May of last year.  I'll probably be a bit rusty, but I still remember most everything about the game, and I'm sure it'll all come back to me.  The rest of the afternoon will be devoted to research.  Lots and lots of research.  Saturday, I'm going to show Ev the second disc of Blue Seed, because I like sharing my obsessions with others whether they like it or not (though in talking with him, I think he's enjoying the show thusfar).  After that, more research.  Sunday's an extremely exciting day, as I'll get to spend it researching, (hopefully) writing, and working.  Joy.  Monday and Tuesday, though not part of the weekend, are really just going to be an extension and a continuation of the weekend's plans--writing, researching, and working.  I'm hoping to have a draft of this paper done by Tuesday so I can give it to my professor.  We'll see; it may be Wednesday before she gets it.  Wendesday will be a day of rest, something I'm sorely in need of.  It's also payday, which is nice.  Thursday will be more exciting, as it's Thanksgiving.  That morning, I'm running in some five mile race with Dad and Clif.  Keep in mind, I've never run five miles at once in my life, and I haven't exactly been tearing up the road on my runs this past month.  I think I can do it, though I may have to walk a bit somewhere around mile 4, but a little walking will recharge the legs and allow me to stumble across the finish line, I think.  My goal is to finish the race in under an hour, which seems reasonable (that's about a mile every 12 minutes).  After the race, it's back to the apartment to clean up, then go pick up Beth and head to Shawnee.  Oh, did I mention that I convinced Beth to come over to my folks' place for Thanksgiving rather than spending it by herself in her apartment.  Besides, it's not like we won't have enough food at home.  Mom said my grandmother started making the stuffing back the beginning of this week.  There will also be at least four pies--pumpkin, pecan, coconut creme, and either chocolate or butterscotch (for Scott and I, because we're picky).  I don't think anyone's ever left our place hungry on Thanksgiving.  Not even when I had just had my wisdom teeth removed two days before the holiday.  Well, back to research.  The Chartists are really, really interesting.  Honest.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Barenaked Ladies, "One Week"

       "Top Five"   One of my favorite books is Nick Hornby's  High Fidelity  (it's also a mighty fine John Cusack movie and a great soundtrack featuring Bob Dylan).  I saw the movie three or four years ago for the first time and absolutely loved it, and I finally tracked down the novel this past year.  I think I've read it four or five times in less than a year.  The main character, Rob, poses an interesting question--am I messed up because I listen to pop music, or do I listen to pop music because I'm messed up?  Think of all the pop songs out there.  Literally thousands of them are about heartache, lost love, and emotional pain.  Why is that?  Part of it, I think, is that musicians and artistic types are usually more attuned to emotions than the rest of society in general.  They turn themselves into receivers for the whole gamut of human experience, from great joy to great sorrow to everything in between.  Artists (of whatever sort) are supposed to express those feelings and ideas the rest of society harbors but cannot figure out how to express.    But so many artists seem to be focused on, obsessed with the darker side of human emotion.  With the pain, the heartache, the end of love and life.  Why is that?  Is it because they're so hyper-sensitive to emotions, that they have to swing to an extreme themselves?  Or are too many musicians just cynics and pessimists?  Look at the lyrics of, say, Nirvana.  Kurt Cobain tapped into a deep primal well of emotion, angst, and pain, and channeled it through very energized music (whatever else you may think of Nirvana, you have to admit that Cobain and Co. were very ernest about their music and tackled it with energy, power, and a healthy dose of emotion).  But was he simply expressing himself, and thousands of kids suddenly went, "wow, that's exactly how I feel," or did he notice that the majority of teens and post-teens were very angsty, unhappy individuals?  It's back to Hornby's question--do we listen to pop music because we're depressed, or are we depressed because we listen to pop music?  Did folks listen to Nirvana because they were angsty, or were they angsty because they listened to Nirvana?  It's really hard to tell, and something of a "chicken or the egg" sort of dilemma.  Besides, it's impossible to make some sort of blanket statement about everyone--no two people listen to the same song in the same way or for the same reason.  For example: when I listen to a song, I mostly listen to lyrics.  I'm a lyrics fiend, and that's why I can't stand most contemporary music (the lyrics are so blah and trite that it makes you ill).  The actual music is secondary; don't get me wrong, I need a good tune to go along with the lyrics, but I can forgive a subpar tune if the lyrics are exceptional.  Clif, on the other hand, listens to the guitar.  That's pretty much it, though I've convinced him to give lyrics a listen on occasion.  One of his favorite musicians is Van Morrison.  Van was actually Clif's motivation for learning the guitar (one too many listens to "Brown Eyed Girl" got him going, really).  Summer of 2002, when Clif and I were in Yellowstone, he got me hooked on Van.  I loved Morrison's work for the lyrics; they were deep, insightful, and poignant, and delivered with a sincerity not often encountered nowadays.  As I became a fan, I started discussing Van's music with Clif.  He knew of my obsession with lyrics, and asked me, "is Van a good lyricist?  I've never really listened to the words."  He owned more than a half dozen Van Morrison CDs at the time.  The words just weren't important to him.  So we all listen to music in different ways.  I think the way I listen to songs, with my focus on lyrics, probably colors the way I relate to the music.  It makes me more susceptable to the emotional heights.  There are tunes and songs that can move me regardless of the lyrics (a couple of the Cowboy Bebop tunes are like that, and some songs are just played so poignantly that it's hard  not  to be moved, regardless of what the words are or even if there are any), but I usually have to go for the words.  And if the words are right, and delivered in the proper way, I'm lost in them.  Completely.  So I'm a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to Hornby's question--sometimes, I'm miserable because I listened to a particularly misery-inducing song, and sometimes I listen to sad songs because I'm already sad.  All I know is that I love music, and I have no intentions of not listening anytime soon.  Now, if only a couple of bands (Moxy Fruvous, Glen Phillips, Wallflowers, Bob Dylan) would put out new albums, I'd be happy as the proverbial pig in mud, even if some of the songs induce emotional misery in me.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Bob Dylan, "Most of the Time"

       "So Ya Thought Ya Might Like To Go To The Show?"   Another morning, and here I sit at work, restless.  There are so many things I could be doing--working on research, finishing up that last little bit on Latin or on my grad school applications, or even looking at the evil 30 page business paper that came in last night.  Instead, I'm sitting here, typing away at this thing as though it mattered, as though more than one or two people actually read it.  Kinda silly, really.  I don't know why I have these bouts of self-doubt.  I'm plagued with them every so often, for reasons I'll never fully understand.  One moment, I'll be ambling along the path of life with no worries.  The next, I'm sitting here pondering my own mortality, considering listening to the Cure, and asking myself, "What's the point, really, when you get down to it?"  It's moments like those when I wish I was an alcoholic.  If I was, the answers would be simple--I'd just drink.  Okay, so that wouldn't answer any of the questions, but after enough alcohol, you don't really care about answers, you just care about whether or not the room will stop spinning.  But alas, I've never really been a big fan of drinking (and I'm too poor to make it much of a habit anyway, at least in the sort of quantity I'd need), so I have to deal with my brain trying to wrap itself around these damn questions.  It all makes me wonder if maybe Socrates was wrong.  Maybe the unexamined life is worth living, if only because you don't have the weight of self-examination crushing you.  This must be how Atlas felt, only his burden seemed light in comparison sometimes.  Really it's all rather immaterial.  I know I'm not going to change anything as fundamental about myself as my desire and willingness to examine my life and myself.  For better or worse, I'm stuck as an examiner in perpetuity.  This probably all comes of listening to too much Pink Floyd.  It'll be the death of me, I swear.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Pink Floyd, "Young Lust"

       "We're Gonna Need A Bigger Boat"   I don't usually do two postings a day, but the past few minutes have been amusing, so I thought I'd share.  See, I'm the only one here at work right now.  Everyone else has gone home for the day in the Writing Center.  We'll get a couple more people to relieve me at 7:00, but from 4:00 until 7:00, I'm basically in charge of the place.  So when I first got in, there was a paper waiting for me to read.  Business/English paper of some sort, I wasn't really sure.  I'm a little tired today, and I didn't get a nap this afternoon, so most things are kinda blurry right now.  Anyway, I looked at the paper and did my thing, then decided to lay my head down for a minute because I'm so damn tired.  Well, I happened to snap back to full wakefulness right before a girl walked in with another paper to proofread (this one's a thirty page Business paper...I'm letting someone else do that one, I already looked at a 15 page Business paper earlier today, and I still haven't recovered).  So I went back to full alertfulness to help her out, just as a  huge group  of prospective students walked into our center, led by one of my boss's supervisors.  When I say "huge," I mean like twenty people.  This room wasn't designed for twenty people to be milling around.  It was barely designed for a half dozen to mill around.  Needless to say, it was a good thing the other student came in right before that, or I wouldn't have been awake when this tour group came by, and I'd probably be getting fired about now.  I'm wide awake now, and kinda bored.  Wish I'd thought to bring some research along with me...though knowing me, I'd have fallen asleep doing research instead.  Caffine just ain't doin' it anymore, folks, I need to start getting energy the natural way--sleeping.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Electric Light Orchestra, "Easy Money"

       "Sometimes The Truth Just Ain't Enough, Or It's Too Much In Times Like This"   Am I content?  That's a very loaded question.  What exactly do I mean by "content?"  Do I mean I like who and what I am, where I am in life and employment, relationships, and things of that nature?  Or simply happy with my lot in life?  I don't really know, to tell you the truth.  I think I'm happy with who I am, though maybe not how I am currently.  And there are certainly some aspects of my life I'd like to change.  My weight, for instance.  I have little to no self control (an issue that plays a very serious and upsetting part in many areas of my life), and tend to just eat food if it's in front of me.  This would be fine if there were no food in front of me ever, but I have a habit of eating.  A lot.  And I still run everyday, but it feels like I'm fighting a losing battle.  I know I've steadily gained weight since Clif left back in July, but I don't seem capable of turning my situation around by myself.  I need an external disciplinarian, I guess.  That's when I usually do best--when there's someone there to watch over and give me mean looks when I'm doing things I know I shouldn't (like going to IHOP at midnight, or eating a whole pizza for dinner).  Both summers I worked for my father, and the summer I spent at Yellowstone, I consistantly lost weight because there was someone there to keep me in line (first dad, then Clif).  I was a good 30 pounds lighter at the beginning of last school year than I am now, I think, and that upsets and distresses me.  My goal is to lose a good ten or fifteen by Christmas, and another ten or fifteen by my birthday (I have to be realistic during the winter--it gets really freakin' cold, sometimes too cold to run everyday).  I think I'm content with who I am intellectually and emotionally.  I've got a pretty good handle on my mind and soul I think, and they're both completely within my control.  I've got a good grasp of this sharing deep personal and emotive information with others, if they're someone I feel I can trust, and I also think I can identify those whom I can trust pretty well.  I can also pretty much out-debate anyone I come across, with a couple of notable exceptions (I have never beat Wendy or Amanda E. in a discussion: Wendy because she's just that much smarter than I, and Amanda because she's that much smarter and because I become extremely flustered and start to babble whenever I'm around her.  I chalk it up to pheremones or her psychic powers).  I can usually defeat people with either more knowledge or better debating skills, though I haven't tried it against someone who possesses both yet.  I'm getting content with my abilities.  My  urlLink comic style  is finally getting to a point where I'm happy with the way the comics look, though Clyde says he doesn't care for the new style because it looks like I'm half-assing the comics (even though it actually takes  longer  to do the sketchy style.  Go figure).  I like where my writing skills are right now, in terms of poetry and songs, and fiction and non-fiction prose.  I have found my style, my voice, and I can usually express things exactly as I want to in an almost effortless manner.  I don't know that I'm content with my location.  Then again, I haven't been since I left Ozarks in May of 2002.  I don't really like OU.  I like a couple of the people here--Jess and Dom are wonderful and warm, Beth is always great fun to spend time with, and Ev challenges my mind in ways that school didn't for a long time.  Anyone else I know here I don't get to see often enough to really have a strong connection.  I hate the school, especially the administration and the crap they keep putting me and thousands of other students through.  I like the classes I took and the professors I've had (with a single notable exception, but he hated me first) well enough, I guess.  It's just...being here has always seemed like it would be temporary.  I think in the back of my head, I always thought I'd stay at Ozarks forever.  Part of that was a product of the time in which I entered Ozarks.  I mean, I was eighteen.  At eighteen, we all think we're going to live forever, that we're going to always be the same person and that everything will remain eternal and unchanging.  Ironically, it's at that age and for the next few years that life changes the most, I think.  I know I'm a very different person from the wide-eyed, introverted whelp who entered Clarksville, AR back in August of 1998.  I'm a different person than the one who entered Norman over a year ago.  And yet I'm still me, and there is continuity between what has gone before and what I am currently.  So, am I content?  I guess it depends on your definition, and what you place your emphasis on.  There are areas of my life in which I'm definitely content, and areas in which I'm not.  But I think it's that way for everyone, really.  I've yet to meet someone who was completely content with everything in their life.  If I ever did, I don't know whether to trust them or wonder what sort of psyhcosomatic drugs they've been taking.  I do hope someday to be content, I strive for it.  And that's probably a good thing--if I got complacent with who and what I was, I would never try to improve myself, right?  I'd stay the same perpetually, and you can't do that.  You have to grow.  Now, if I could just start growing in the metaphysical sense as opposed to the physical, I'd be set.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Cake, "Rock & Roll Lifestyle"

       "All That's Left Of Me Is My Celebrity"   Amidst all the  Strum und Drang  of last night, I forgot to mention a couple of positive things that occurred yesterday.  First, I finally picked up some new running shoes, so maybe now my legs will stop trying to kill me every time I run.  The other and more important thing was my friend Sarah Rosenberg called me out of the blue.  Turns out I'd given her my phone number in a random email we'd exchanged several weeks ago that I'd honestly completely forgotten about it.  So when she called me yesterday evening about half an hour before I headed off for work, I was pleasantly surprised to say the least.  I shot the proverbial bull with her for a bit, then headed off to work.  She is one person who really has her life together and figured out.  Sarah's always been a rather focused person, knowing exactly what she wants and going for it with an intensity and drive that I find myself wishing I could emulate.  Instead, I usually find myself listless and aimless, cast adrift with little direction and no wind in my sails, attempting to coast over still water.  I got a copy of the latest Barenaked Ladies album from James over the weekend, and I've been giving it a spin the past couple of days.  My verdict is that it's quite good, which is nice because I needed a decent album after the other most recent CD I picked up, the Strokes'  Room on Fire , which sucked like an industrial vaccum.  I was left unimpressed by the Strokes, finding their musicianship rather basic and their lyrics trite and uninspired.  Everything sort of chugs along at the same pace, with no attention paid to finding real hooks or melodies, but rather relying on playing fast and loud a la 70s punk, but without the energy or real swagger.  If these guys are supposed to be the saviors of rock and roll, I don't think I want to be redeemed.  But as I said, the Barenaked Ladies' newest,  Everything to Everyone , is quite good.  Not their best--then again, it's hard to top the genius of their debut,  Gordon , or of  Stunt , or even the inspired live versions found on  Rock Spectacle --but still a good, solid effort with some memorable tunes, lots of hooks and the great harmonies I've come to expect from the Ladies, and a healthy dose of their trademark humor with a measure of maturity.  This is a band that is comfortable with the music it's making, and that shines through on each song.  The members of the band are enjoying themselves, they're enjoying the music they make, and they've found their groove.  Plus, "Another Postcard" is just damn fun, and it's not even the best song on the album.  Any album where I can find at least three or four songs that I enjoy is a good album, in my opinion, and this album manages to dish out at least a half dozen tunes that I'm hooked on.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Barenaked Ladies, "Maybe Katie"

       "I Want A Reason For The Way Things Have To Be"   I picked the title for this particular rant earlier today, while listening to the Train song "Calling All Angels."  The words appealed to me on a very intellectual level--I find myself always searching for the "Why."  That's the reason I never understood math--all the math teachers I ever had only told me how.  They would tell me that to get the answer, I had to apply this formula, and I would get what I needed.  They never told me why that particular formula was the one I used, or why it was right, they simply told me that was the formula you used in that instance.  I always hated that; as a result, I never bothered with math, and my meager abilities in the subject even today atest to that fact.  But somewhere in the past hour or so, the meaning of those words morphed into something much more emotional and deep, much darker.  I still want to know why things happen, but now I have particular things in mind, and very particular people I'd like to ask "why" to, and I know I can't ask that person, because I'm not in a position where I can.  I'm also not in a position to really speak plainly about the subject I'm dancing around, because it is not mine to disclose, and it is not yours to hear about.  That I heard about it and now have to deal with the consequences is immaterial, really.  Mostly, I want to know why people are cruel.  What drives mankind to do the stupid, senseless, and above all selfish things we do on a daily basis to one another?  When did we get it in our heads that it was okay to destroy the reality of another person?  Or that we could make unilateral decisions that do not only affect us?  When did each individual on the whole damn planet decide that they were the only person that really mattered, and everyone else was incidental?  I remember a passage I read in a Terry Pratchett book a while back.  The book is called  Carpe Jugulum , and it's about vampires. But there's this marvelous subplot running through it about a young priest of the Omnian Church (a wonderful pun on Catholicism, as "omnia" means "whole," and Catholic, of course, means "universal") who goes through a crisis of faith.  At one point, he gets into an argument with Granny Weatherwax, the Discworld's greatest witch, currently possibly a vampire herself, and very much an atheist.  Oh, she knows gods exist, and has even met a few of them, but she doesn't believe in them.  Believing in gods just gives them ideas above their station.  Granny insists that all sin, at the most basic level, starts with treating people as things.  Once you do that, you'll do anything, because you stop seeing people as people, and start seeing them as objects.  When you treat someone as an object, you'll see no reason why killing someone is wrong, or robbing them, or taking away those they care about.  You'll have no qualms about starting wars, destroying communities, eliminating ways of life, and abusing the sensibilities and bodies of those around you.  It all starts with treating someone as something.  And when you think of a person as an object rather than a human being, you stop understanding that the things you can do can hurt them.  You lose the ability to empathize with them, to see things from their perspective.   You start thinking that whatever you do is fine, because you're the only person whose opinions in the matter are important .  And therein lies the greatest sin a human can commit against another human--thinking that only you matter.  And that's why I'm mad as hell right now, and that's why I really want to seriously hurt a certain person right now, even though I know it would only make the situation worse, and would only exacerbate the problem.  To the person whom I'm writing this for: you know who you are, if you happen to be reading this (which I doubt), and you have my deepest sympathies, and I'm here if you need me.  Always.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Cream, "Badge"

       "Born Before The Wind"   Well, the weekend at Ozarks was a wonderful vacation from reality.  No obligations, no required activities, no deadlines, no heavy reading (except for when I was playing Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy on X-Box, oddly enough--the game, while exceptionally well-done and very entertaining, had no voice acting, but only text.  LOTS of text).  Watched several movies, including Matrix: Huge Plotholes (aka Revolutions), Matrix: Reloaded ( after  having watched Revolutions.  Neither one made any sense because of this), and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (featuring the world's best Marka Hamill and Carrie Fisher cameos  ever ).   Got to see several very close friends whom I had not seen in much too long.  Basically spent the weekend in the presence of people whom I love and adore, and didn't really have too much to worry or think about.  Life is good.  Now I am back in Norman, sitting at work.  I spend a lot of time sitting at work.  While sitting here, I'm contemplating an idea my father half-jokingly planted in my head this afternoon while we were washing the car.  I think I'm going to apply to Cambridge.  Yeah, that's Cambridge University in Cambridge, England.  Yes, it's one of the most prestigious schools in the English-speaking world.  Yes, I have about as much of a chance of getting accepted as I do of getting a date in the next five minutes.  But by God, what's the point of living if you don't take risks and chances, right?  And who knows--I might just get accepted, and how kick ass would  THAT  be?  In other news, my old car, the Sunfire, was sold today to Jessica Bowie.  I'm given to understand that selling vehicles and the like to friends is a double-edged sword of a deal--on the one hand, you can give them a good deal, you know it's going to a good home, and you know it'll be taken care of.  On the other hand, if something goes wrong with it, they know who to blame.  I was thinking that I'll really miss that car, then I remembered that I'll still see it all the time, like an ex-girlfriend whom you have classes with.  Only chances are, I'll still be able to ride in the Sunfire.  Won't be driving it anymore, and that's a shame because I always enjoyed driving that car, but so it goes.    On a completely unrelated note, I got one of those AOL-type CDs in the mail over the weekend.  Y'know, the ones for the free trial?  Well, the activation code for this one is "summer-monkey."  I found that amusing in ways I cannot even begin to describe.  And, apropos of nothing, I can't decide whether to get the Glen Phillips "Live at Largo" album (which comes out Tuesday) or Jars of Clay's latest offering, which came out a couple of weeks ago apparently.  Perhaps both?  No, not enough cash for both.  Probably go for the Glen Phillips and ask for the other one for Christmas.  What does this have to do with anything?  Absolutely nothing, but I'm just rambling and filling up space for now.  Booya.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Barenaked Ladies, "Another Postcard"

       "They Call Him Mr. Jellyroll"   Well, in just a few short hours, I'll be heading out to Clarksville, wind in my hair, sun in my face, the...er...crap, it's soggy and rainy and cold and nasty today.  Then again, whenever I make plans to go on a trip (either to home or to Ozarks), it always decides to rain.  It's getting to where that's the only sort of weather I know how to drive on the interstate in.  ...I'm disturbed.  I was just given a hand treatment, which isn't nearly as dirty as it sounds.  Apparently it involves using several different creams on your hand to exfoliate and cleanse and make your skin silky smooth.  I feel emasculated now, and I'm never letting my boss talk me in to that sort of thing again.  My hands feel weird and much too soft.  I think I may have exfoliated a callous or two, and that depresses me.  If my drawing callous is gone, there will be hell to pay.  My boss, while directing the Writing Center, also sells Mary Kay.  Which is all well and good--y'know, women apparently feel they need make up and creams and cremes and God knows what, and someone out there has to know how it all works and what all you need.  But do I really need to be dragged into it?  I don't think so.  I'm emasculated enough anyway, what with being wrapped around the little finger of virtually every attractive woman I know (and most of the women I know are attractive, so you can imagine how interesting that is).  I really don't need hand treatments and the like.  In other news, leading researchers have discovered that lots and lots of caffine will be necessary for Chuck to stay awake long enough to drive to Clarksville.  Barring that, he just needs to sit there and recount the shame of having a hand treatment this morning, and the burning shame will keep me awake and wishing I wasn't.  Okay, I really don't have anything much to say.  Go read  urlLink Crooked Halo , where I'm making pretty boy archangels join boy bands today.  It'll be even more fun Monday, when another character from the strip ends up in the band, too.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Aerosmith, "Ten Inch Record"

       "And I'm Callin' Time And Temperature Just For Some Company"   In Chuck's growing List of Idiots, we've got a new entry.  The story comes courtesy of my mom, and just proves how bloody moronic and naive high school students are.  Well, some high school students, anyway.  I don't recall being this dense when I was in high school, but that might just be a trick of memory.  Anyway, so these kids are sitting in a freshman English class, drinking something out of a Sonic cup.  The "something" turns out to be rum and coke.  When the students go to the classroom door to confer with a buddy of theirs who happened to drop by, the teacher (not my mother, I should note) noticed something was up.  She calls out to the kids, they bolt.  She chases them down, catches them, and drags them to the principal's office.  So these kids are sitting in the principal's office, and one of them keeps maintaining that he only had "one drink."  In the middle of making this protest, his eyes sorta bug out, he makes a run for the garbage can, and he doesn't make it.  Puddle o' vomit.  Yeah, the kid may've only had one drink, but only if by one drink you mean "one cupful of the drink."  Baka.  Mom and I are rolling because of this whole incident, but it also bothers me on a basic level.  Maybe I just wasn't privy to it when I was in high school, but I'm pretty sure most of the students who were there when I attended high school knew better than to  drink  in the  classroom .  I mean,  outside  of the classroom, I make no mistakes that at least a couple of them had to be doing something stupid and illegal, but while actually sitting in class?  What made these children think they could get away with that?  Or that it was okay?  Do kids today just have no sense of right and wrong?  Or do they just think that perhaps the rules don't apply to them?  Maybe it's a thrill thing--"heh, lookit me, I'm drinkin' in the classroom, hur hur hur."  Where'd they even get ahold of rum, anyway?  Mom and Dad apparently need to learn how to lock the ol' liquor cabinet.  I mean, I really drank until I got into college.  Oh, I'd had a sip of dad's beer once or twice, and maybe a bit of champagne on New Year's, but I'd never really had a drink.  And even when I was an undergraduate, I only got tipsy once, and that was under my parents' roof while they were home (admittedly, they were on the other side of the house and sound asleep, but they knew Wendy and I were drinking), and I had the good sense not to do anything stupid.  I wasn't drinking during the course of the school day, and I sure as hell wasn't drinking during  class .  Do they just make kids stupider than they did when I was younger?  My friend Ev maintains that the generation following me--the Millennials, I believe he calls them--are apathetic like the flannel-clad Gen-Xers, but cast adrift like the Baby Boomers, and ultimately don't give a damn about anything except the moment.  While that's nice and Buddhist of them, living in the moment and all, they seem to forget about anything that doesn't directly apply to them.  Ev says they have no understanding of vertical chronology--that is, the distant past is just as foreign to them as three years ago, and the future is just as foreign as that.  Not only is the past a foreign country to these kids, but they can't even conceive of wanting to visit it or that anything really exists in that country.  It's all rather depressing for a history major, someone trained to think vertically.  All these kids are aware of is horizontal chronology--what is happening here and now, perhaps across a broad territory, but probably not.  The fact is, they don't care unless it's directly related to them, and they probably still don't care very much then.  It's bloody depressing, really.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Old '97s, "Big Brown Eyes"

       "Last Train To Clarksville"   So it's official: I'm finally taking a trip to Ozarks this weekend.  Needless to say, I am very happy about that.  I haven't seen any of the Ozarks crew since July.   July , people.  It's been like 3 1/2, 4 months.  That's too long, especially since I didn't get to see everyone on that trip.  Anyway, the very prospect of the Ozarks trip excites me, and I can hardly wait until Friday.  But, alas, I have to--there is much to be done between now and then.  It does mean I have to start thinking about what CDs I'm going to take.  This is a more important task than you can imagine, for the CDs I pack are my only form of entertainment for a good eight hours while I'm on the road.  I usually use a case that holds 24, so that gives me a decent variety to choose from.  It's just a matter of determining my mood.  Do I want to listen to contemporary stuff?  Or am I in a strictly classic rock mood?  Perhaps a mixture of both?  Do I want to listen to polished, carefully and exactingly produced music, or am I in the mood for something with more rough edges?  What about lyrical and musical themes?  Am I in the mood for slow, sad stuff, or uptempo, energetic stuff?  What'll end up happening is a mixture of all of the above, with a liberal dose of complete randomness thrown in.  So far, I've come up with the following obvious choices:  The Beatles, "Hard Day's Night" Yoko Kanno & the Seatbelts, "Cowboy Bebop" Mix Van Morrison, "What's Wrong with this Picture?" (or maybe "Moondance," can't decide) The Wallflowers, "The Wallflowers" Bob Dylan, "Live 1966" Gorillaz, "Gorillaz" Counting Crows, "Hard Candy" Toad the Wet Sprocket, "Coil" George Harrison, "All Things Must Pass" Dire Straits, "Sultans of Swing: The Best of Dire Straits" Mark Knopfler, "Ragpicker's Dream"  There will be many others, I assure you, but those are the ones I've determined so far.  Anyway, I'm really looking forward to the weekend.  I'll get to see some friends, take my mind off the hook for a couple of days, and just sit back and groove.  And probably get fed.  If nothing else, a stop will be made at the infamous Dodge's, and Pizza Stix will be had.  Mmm, Pizza Stix.  I don't know who came up with those artery-clogging darlings, but they are the epitome of mankind's culinary arts.  I mean, c'mon--a flakey pastry shell containing meat, cheese, and all of it deep-fried to a golden brown perfection.  It's the perfect food, the solid equivalent of ambrosia.  I've been going through withdrawals since July, and I think it's why I've had the shakes the past few days...though that could be related to sticking my finger in the light socket as well, but I have my doubts.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Yoko Kanno & the Seatbelts, "Call Me, Call Me"

       "I Don't Do Sketches From Memory"   So yesterday was a day for the comics.  First, I had a comic featured over at  urlLink Stripper's Corner  (which sounds dirtier than it actually is).  Then I had a comic featured in the  urlLink Oklahoma Daily , and someone actually sent me an email in regards to said comic (and the email contained words of praise, no less!).  Also, the girl I submit comics to at the paper sent me an email about some College Cartoonist Award thing I'm going to try for.  So there was a lot of comical love goin' down for the ol' Chuck yesterday.  And now I have another comic in the newspaper again today.  I actually rule that paper now, they just don't realize it yet.  I keep wondering if the other "cartoonists" (having seen their work, I use that term loosely) are going to just quit.  I wish they would; it would mean I didn't have to share my space with hacks.  That's all sounding a lot more conceited than I originally planned, but the fact of the matter is, the rest of the people who do comics here just...aren't really that good.  Either their art is crappy (one guy in particular has a style that's way too jagged and has too many corners, while another has characters who always look like  urlLink this  even when they haven't beaten their heads against a filing cabinet) or the comic's just aren't funny, or they're so specific to a certain time, place, and group, that only about five people are even going to chuckle at the damn thing.  Then again, I've been trying to draw comics since I was in high school, and I also have existing characters with clearly-defined personalities to work with already.  I'm just sort of advantaged in the comiking, I guess.  Anyway, these are all just small steps in my plan to take over the world with humor.  The next step is to convince people to pay me to draw funny pictures.  Once that's going, then all will be well.  Or something.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Wallflowers, "Into the Mystic"

       "What Planet Is This?"   Well, I'm starting to finally get in a better mood, though I'm still not entirely sure why I was so depressed/moody all of last week.  Perhaps it was the change in the weather, or the fact that I was only able to run like twice (legs were killing me, and weather was not permitting), or maybe just a bunch of crap happened right at the beginning of the week that colored the rest of the week in shades of gray, black, and other murky neutral tones.  Anyway, in the finest tradition of my rants, I'm gonna make fun of stupid people, because they're so damn plentiful and make it too damn easy.  The first person I want to attack/berate/make fun of is this guy who writes for the school paper.  I won't mention his name, because it's not really pertinant, but suffice to say he's got high ideas of himself and a low opinion of anyone who disagrees with him.  He's also an English major, so I think that might have something to do with his basic pompous nature.  Well, on Friday last, this guy wrote an article for the paper advocating paying the student athletes for all the hard work they do.  Because the full scholarships, room and board, and special perks (like having someone like me available to proofread their papers for them) aren't enough.  Because having their books provided, laptops loaned to them by the school, and receiving a free education isn't enough compensation.  No, since this guy maintains that student athletes have to work twice as hard as regular students to maintain decent grades, and since he believes most student athletes think they'll go on to play professionally (even though [1] he admits that only about 1% of them will and [2] most of them don't actually think that, except for a lot of the football players), we ought to give them monetary compensation.  Basically, he wants to pay them for having delusions of grandeur.  If the school's gonna do that, I want them to start paying me because I think I might be able to become a syndicated cartoonist someday, or at least be able to live off my comic (and hey, if I can convince them to pay me, I will be able to, just as the student athletes would be professional ones if they were paid.  That's sorta how "professional" is defined: you get paid to do it).  The idea is actually rather perverse, I thought, and I was offended down to my very soul by the idea.  Hell, here's an idea--why don't we get rid of all the student athletes and just hire professional athletes?  We wouldn't have to give them room and board, or provide them with the academic center, or pretend we're interested in educating them like we do the student athletes (because I'm fairly certain most of the coaches and administration at this school are only paying lip service to the idea of "they're here for education."  They're really here to bring the university lots of money).  It's the perfect set up; all it lacks is common sense and a healthy dose of reality.  That was rather theraputic.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Yoko Kanno & the Seatbelts, "Space Lion"

       "What's Up Sweetcakes"   Do you ever wonder why people sometimes feel melancholy?  Why sometimes we're depressed for no reason?  Why does the weather affect our moods?  If it's sunny outside, we tend to smile more, or if it's dreary and gray, we feel blah and under the weather (no pun intended...I don't think).  There's something about late fall and into winter that makes you want to stay in bed all day, not move, not face the outside world.  It makes me not want to jog, or leave the apartment until at least my birthday.  By the same token, nasty weather (such as rain or snow) always makes me want to move.  When I'm restricted to the apartment because of the percipitation, it makes me want to defy that, to go out and go somewhere.  I always want to take a roadtrip when the weather's at its worst, because logic and common sense dictate that I ought to bunker down and wait for everything to blow over.  I was flipping through my photo album this afternoon, looking at the pictures of my friends from these recent years.  Looking at all the smiles, all the good times, the moments captured in 3" x 5".  It's funny, but most of the pictures are from the last few weeks of school my senior year and graduation, both mine and the one from 2003 (when several of my friends graduated).  There aren't many pictures from the four years I actually spent at the school, just from the last few moments I was there.  I think that's a part of human nature--while we're in the middle of something, we don't ever think of it ending.  In a way, I thought I'd always be with that group of people at Ozarks, that nothing would ever change, that we'd always be there.  When it dawned on me that this wasn't going to be the case (I tried to deny it up until about two or three weeks before graduating), I attempted to hurriedly collect evidence that I'd been there for four years, tangible memories and memoribilia to commemorate my time at that place with those people.    I graduate from OU in about seven months.  In the almost year and a half that I've been here so far, I've made some rather close friends, people whom I don't want to let go of.  And I have nothing tangible to show that I've known them so far, no physical evidence that they've been a part of my life except the occasional faint smile I wear on my face when thinking about them.  I need to find my camera.  I need to correct this inequity.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Yoko Kanno & the Seatbelts, "Ask DNA"

       "Friends And Family, Kith And Kin"   On a whim, I decided to go visit my maternal grandparents yesterday afternoon.  I knew Scott, my youngest sibling, was going to be there as well; in fact, we'd discussed me visiting over the phone late Thursday night, and decided it'd be a pleasant surprise for my grandmother, who's been feeling low the past few weeks.  Anyway, to make a long story short, our little plan was a success.  Scott told Grandma that there was a surprise coming for her.  When she opened the door and saw me, her face lit up in a geniune smile, and that alone made the whole trip worth it.  On top of that, I got to sit and chat with my grandparents for the afternoon, got a free meal out of the deal, and it occupied most of my otherwise empty Friday.  The trip, though short, was thus probably one of the more worthwhile trips I've taken since I went to Ozarks for Chris and JP's going away party back at the end of July.  Come to think of it, that was actually the last trip I made to Ozarks.  That's something I plan on rectifying next weekend, though.  I need to make another trip to 'Zarks before Thanksgiving, because after Thanksgiving will just be too hectic.  Beyond that, there's not much to say here.  I wrote another song while jogging last night.  I guess I'll leave you with it.  It's rather tongue in cheek, but fun nonetheless.  And kinda country-ish, oddly enough.  But I still like it.  Enjoy the first verse and the chorus.  "Gospel Truth" Got a posterboard picture of Jesus in my pocket Got the words of the Holy Father on my lips Got two blind eyes in my sockets I'm devout, forgiven, and oh-so hip Gonna rock and roll all night to the Gospel station Gonna pray real hard for my salvation And I know when I take my eternal rest I'm gonna to the place that's the best.  Amen, brothers and sisters, amen.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Ben Folds, "Rockin' the Suburbs"

       "Last Night I Danced With A Stranger"   I find myself listening to a lot of Bob Dylan of late.  By "of late" I mean "the past few years."  Ever since I saw him in concert back in August of 2001, I've been somewhat obsessed, to be honest.  Dylan is an aquired taste, to be certain.  I know lots of folks can't stand his stuff, either because of his voice, his cyptic lyrics, or his penchant for songs that have ten or eleven verses and no bridge.  But I'm fascinated by his work, whether it's his early solo acoustic folk, or the electrified folk rock of 1965-66, the biblical parablism of the late '60s, the emotive acoustic full band of the '70s, or the world-weary, full-circle Americana of the '90s and '00s.  I try to forget that the '80s existed, mostly because most of his stuff that decade was subpar (except for a few isolated tunes and his work with the Traveling Wilburys).  Anyway, one of my favorite albums is the latter-day masterpiece  Time Out of Mind .  It's a very heavy, emotive album, and Dylan sounds weary, exhausted, and defeated throughout most of it.  Its an album populated with drifters, lovesick men and women, old men sitting in diners smoking cheap cigars and wondering when the hell the world they fought so hard for became this one.  The whole CD is great, but the song I've been stuck on the past few days is "Standing in the Doorway."  "Standing in the Doorway" is Dylan at his most emotive.  Say what you will for his raspy, throaty vocals, he lends a tone and effect in this song that tugs at the heartstrings.  The music is slow, mournful, a dirge of a waltz to a love who walked away.  Over the course of seven minutes and five verses, Dylan sketches the image of a man worn out, exhausted by the effort of surviving the day to day grind.  On top of all that, the narrator has lost his woman, and has "nothin' to go back to now."  He is haunted by this woman, tormented by her memory.  It colors his world in a very dark and very murky way.  I think the line that really does it for me is when he sings, "Last night I danced with a stranger, but she just reminded me you were the one."  His voice quavering, cracking, rasping, the sheer emotional intensity of the phrases...Dylan's voice may be shot, but one starts to think that's possibly the best thing that could have happened.  He is no longer the social crusader of the early '60s, nor the cryptic poet lauret of the new music revolution of the mid '60s.  He's not the troubador of the '70s, or the religious convert of the '80s.  He is a weary, lonesome man, one who has dragged his body down the road for too long, seen the revolution fail, seen the world he fought hard against come into being anyway, and has yet survived.  That's exactly what Dylan and his characters are--survivors of the counter-revolution, those who saw everything fall apart, and yet still find a reason to go on.  Whether that's wisdom or stupidity is yet to be seen.  Somewhere out there on the road is a man, perpetually traveling, never arriving.  The eternal drifter, the man who knows only the journey, walks the same road for his whole existence, seeing nothing else and never finding a resting place to call "home."  Dylan has tapped into that primal traveler, exposed his core and soul and channeled it through music.  And we're lucky enough to hear it.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Bob Dylan, "Standing in the Doorway"

       "Lyric Jam #1"   Random lyrics I'm making up off the top of my head...enjoy.  Everything's fine, we're all alright, we'll survive We're probably all just in denial Can't accept the truth of our reality We don't cry 'cause we can't stop the smile The whisper of an endless dream An echo of a thought Striving for things we don't understand Trying to be what we're not Swallow your empty, meaningless words Swallow foolish pride and vanity Face the facts of your inevitable demise And look towards the coming calamity My mind is stretched broader than the horizon It can accomodate all of existence Wave a magic wand at my life Erase the pain and resistance.  That ought to be enough of that for one day.  I find myself worn out lately, like I've been stretched too thin across too many fronts.  Maybe I should take my lesson from the Germans and not fight wars on two fronts, metaphorically speaking.  I feel almost transparent, as though someone could look through me and see out the other side if I weren't wearing clothes (don't worry, I don't plan on running around naked anytime soon...not as cold as it suddenly is).  I'm trying to do too much, I guess, but that's where it's odd--I'm not really getting anything accomplished, it seems.  Quite the predicament, really.  I guess you could classify this as some sort of psychological cry for help.  I tend to think of it more as a cry for alcohol and a good night's rest.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Electric Light Orchestra, "Easy Money"

       "You've Got A Lot Of Nerve"   I feel like a fake sometimes.  Like I have to continue smiling and joking while things fall apart.  Like I have to fiddle while Rome burns.  "Outside the dawn is waking, my makeup may be flaking but my smile still stays on," as Freddie Mercury croons.  I'm stressed by a dozen little things at once, but I feel almost obligated to continue laughing and cracking jokes and being the clown of the world, sans stupid wig and custard pie.  But why?  Who gave me this job, this role?  No one but myself, though now I feel as though it's expected of me.  It's like once people accepted me in the role of humorist and fool, they couldn't accept me in any other role.  I got typecast by reality.  Admittedly, it's a role I feel very natural in, and I enjoy making people laugh.  But it also kinda limits me.  Whenever I feel down or upset, it's almost like I can't express that, because it doesn't meet everyone's expectations.  So I force the humor, even when I don't feel like being funny.  I do it for the benefit of others mostly, but I guess it's also for my own benefit.  I've always used humor and laughter as a defense mechanism, and years of being picked on in elementary and junior high school helped me form a wit and sense of humor that's quick and occasionally very barbed.  Admittedly, I didn't express most of my thoughts or comments when I was in those formative years; rather, they remained unspoken.  But in those years, I developed the sense of humor I have now--a little sarcastic, a little wry, a little odd.  When I got into high school and actually started speaking up, it surprised many of my old schoolmates.  Which I enjoyed--taking them on in a battle of wits became enjoyable, because most of them entered the contest unarmed in comparison.  In a way, the humorist part of me is self-created, self-imposed.  I want to be the funny one, the guy everyone thinks is humorous and entertaining and a proverbial hoot to talk to.  I want to have energy and wit and exuberance.  But I don't want to be so two-dimensional, so flat.  There are other aspects of my personality.  And hell, sometimes I just feel depressed and shouldn't have to keep making with the funny, right?  Admittedly, I don't want to be depressed as often as I was (for ridiculous reasons, it seems in hindsight) as an undergraduate.  But I don't think I can maintain some sort of manic energy and always be upbeat and funny.  It just doesn't work that way.  There was a reason for this rant, a very good reason, and now it all seems pointless.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Bob Dylan, "Positively 4th Street"

       "Idiot Wind"   Today's rant is going to be a hodge-podge of the idiots I've had to deal with lately, because I think we'll all find it amusing and because if I don't blow off some steam, I may kill someone.  The overwhelming idocy I seem to have to deal with on almost a daily basis startles me, especially since it doesn't all come from student-athletes.  The first idiot was here in the Writing Center, about two or three weeks ago, and was a student-athlete.  I think I might have mentioned him--a tour came through, and this moron kept telling said tour that we wrote papers for him.  As a result of his stupidity, we are limited in what we can and cannot do to a student's paper.  One of the big things I'd do is help with word choice.  Students, whether athletes or not, often use the wrong word.  Either they don't have the vocabulary for what they're trying to say, or they just misuse a word.  Whatever, it happens, even to me.  So I'd suggest other words.  Or I'd rework a sentence so it flowed better.  Well, no more.  Now all I can do is circle where the mistake is and tell there's a mistake.  I can't offer suggestions on how to fix it.  Stupid.  The next group of idiots were encountered this past Saturday during the OU/OSU game.  I went for my jog during the third quarter, and as I was walking back, I saw a group of OU students (well, college-age guys wearing OU shirts) heckling a ten year old wearing OSU stuff.   A ten year old .  Am I alone in thinking that if they have to pick on a ten year old to win an argument, they really have no business being in college?  Mind you, OSU fans were no better--as I continued walking, I came even with an older couple in orange.  As we all walked past a house near the stadium, someone started up a call and answer "OSU" "Sucks."  Well, this set the old guy off, and he starts complaining loudly about how asanine OU fans are.  Which they are, but OSU fans are not innocent themselves.  I mean, come on, people, it's a freakin'  game  you're getting worked up over here.  How or why is this so damn important?  I sometimes wonder if all these morons are placed in my path simply to test my patience.  Or maybe it's just indicative of football and its fans (the student-athlete who caused trouble a few weeks ago was a football player).  This state's morbid fascination with all things college football is ridiculous and probably some sort of social disease.  I keep wondering if it's airborne and whether or not I should wear a mask when I come to work.  In non-football-related stupidity, I think folks need to learn how to use their damn turn signals.  Lemme explain--the little switch thing on the left side of your steering column?  Yeah, that's the turn signal.  If you push it up, the right turn signal flashes.  Push it down, the left turn signal flashes.  These are designed to be used  before  you turn.  Not in the middle of the turn.  Not after you've started the turn.   Before .  In case you're curious, it's to warn other people on the road what it is you're doing so they don't run into you.  I swear, if I come across one more dipshit who doesn't know how to use these things, I'm going to go librarian poo.  Tune in next time, when I'll discuss merging onto the interstate and why that doesn't mean "driving 35 MPH" or "coming to a complete stop when no one's coming."  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, "In the Dark of the Sun"

       "Some Are Dead And Some Are Living"   I heard from a third party last night that an aquaintance of mine, Linda Carcamo, died on Friday.  I'm not sure of the details or specifics, other than she apparently drowned, but the news still comes as a shock.  Linda was a year older than me to the day.  We always joked about having the same birthday.  She was in my graduating class at Ozarks, and she was a bright student.  I know she was from Central or South America, but I'm ashamed to admit I don't remember what country exactly.  But that was immaterial.  She was a warm, caring individual who never got mad or angry.  I never heard her say anything mean or negative to anyone in the four years I knew her.  I'm quite sad to say I never got to know her as well as I should have, but you don't really think about that sort of thing when you're college-age, do you?  I mean, at eighteen, nineteen, you're pretty certain that you'll live forever, regardless of the evidence.  But that's not the case; we're mortal, we're temporary.  It just makes me feel almost sick to know that good people like Linda die for stupid, stupid reasons, and evil, cruel people go on living long, comfortable lives.  Where's the cosmic, karmic justice?  I guess Billy Joel was right when he said "only the good die young," but that doesn't make it any easier to deal with.  To those who knew Linda, my heart is with you.  Though I only knew her briefly, and never as well as I wanted, she touched my life in a very positive, reaffirming way, and she will be greatly missed.  Others will be able to describe her life more eloquently than I, and in greater detail, but I hope that my words can be of comfort to someone, even if it's only to me.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: The Beatles, "In My Life"

       "On Certain Sundays In November"   I find it hard to believe it's already November.  Thanksgiving is only a few weeks away.  Christmas and the New Year are just around the corner.  My final semester here at OU is only two and half months away from beginning.  It's hard to imagine I've already been here almost a year and a half.  Each day marks the longest I've remained in one place since I started college.  Oh, sure, I kept the same dorm room for three years at Ozarks.  Even had the same roommate(s), Chris and JP.  But we always had to move out for Christmas (though we could leave our stuff there) and completely in the Summer, stuff and all, only to haul it all back up three flights of stairs in August again (and that was always hell, let me tell you).  When I started attending OU, I lived at home because I hadn't had time to look for an apartment in Norman.  I'd been in Yellowstone all summer and only found out I was attending OU my last day in the park; when would I have had time to apartment hunt?  But the last week of September, I found the apartment at Parkview.  They let me move in, and I started living there full time the first week of October.  I'm still there, having lived in the same place through the summer for once.  That's a little odd to me, but comforting, too.  It's nice having a single place to always come back to, someplace a bit more permanent than a dormroom.  Don't get me wrong--after three years, that room in McLean Hall was starting to feel like home.  We always had the same room, I always had the same bedroom in our room (it was a little modified suite--a common room and two little bedrooms).  There was continuity there.  We'd hang up the same posters again, though each year there were new additions (I still remember when Chris got the Army of Darkness movie poster.  That was one of my favorites).  When I left Ozarks, it felt like I was leaving home.  Especially since the home I was returning to never did feel like a real home.  See, my parents moved over Christmas my Junior year at Ozarks, and the house we moved in to lacked a bedroom for yours truly.  I sleep in the study when I go back to Shawnee.  It's called my room, but there's always a part of me that feels it's not home anymore.  Instead, it's where my parents live.  Not to mention the fact that the longest I've actually stayed there since we moved has been about a month.  The summer between Junior and Senior year was spent on the road with my dad every week, so I was only home for the weekends.  The next summer was spent at Yellowstone, and we left only a week after school got out.  So the longest I ever stayed at home was when I came back from Yellowstone and lived there for part of August and September.  So I guess I'm developing an attachment to my apartment, despite its rather ghetto-esque appearance and general feel.  The toilet doesn't work well, there's no central air, the heater sounds arthritic, the floors are ancient linolium that I can't keep clean unless I'm willing to sweep and mop every other day (which I'm not), and I can hear the train every time it goes by or the football game whenever we're having one.  Despite all these things, the place kinda feels like home.  It fits around me like a second, clunky skin of mortar and concrete and aging building materials.  It's not the prettiest or most comfortable place in the world, but it's a place to call my own, a space for me, and I'm content with that.  All of which means I really do not want to move come May.  But I'll kinda have to, or in late July/early August at the latest.  Why?  Because it's on to the next school.  May seems like the most likely time to move because that's when my lease ends, and I don't want to have to sign a new one just to stay there a couple of months.  But at the same time, I have nowhere to store all the stuff I've accumulated there, no place to put it at home.  I'm a bit torn as to what to do, to be honest.  But I guess that'll all be taken care of as it comes up.  No point trying to burn bridges I haven't crossed yet.  No, that sort of behavior is only suitable for bridges that've been crossed, because that means then I can't go backwards.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Rhett Miller, "This is what I do"

       "Bringing It All Back Home"   Well, back in Norman finally, and so much to catch up on.  Need to unpack everything, get my new home theatre system hooked up (probably have to purchase speaker wire first), and things of that nature.  Also have to catch up on all the things I missed while I was away from the computer, mostly comic-related.  For instance, I read something like 60 different webcomics, which update anywhere from seven days a week to five, to three, to once a week, or just sporadically (a great number of them seem sporadic lately).  I've been gone for a week, so I haven't read any of them.  Which means lots and lots of comics to go through.  I also need to draw, scan, and upload a few more Crooked Halo comics.  I have one for tomorrow, but that's the end of my buffer.  I also have to draw the next two Troubled Times comics...actually, I have to draw four of them, since we're doing the omake/outtakes thing, and putting up two of them per Saturday.  So I have to do those as well, which will be difficult, since I'm not used to drawing the characters and still don't really know how to draw Teran's hair.  Ah well.  Anyway, Christmas was great fun, but I'm glad to be back in Norman, where I have access to the outside world.  Without a computer at home, I feel rather isolated from everyone I know, since I communicate with most of them via the Internet (whether it be email, IM, or whatever).  Craziness.  Well, off to unpack.  Wooooo.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: George Harrison, "All Things Must Pass"

       "I Will Go Down With This Ship"   Well, I watched Pirates of the Caribbean this evening with my parents and grandparents.  I'd never seen the movie before, oddly enough, but I'd heard very good things about it from everyone I talked to, so I asked for it (and received it) for Christmas.  We watched it on the DVD player my parents bought my grandparents for Christmas.  Very quality flick, I decided.  The CGI was just right; had they used the moonlight/undead effect any more than they did, it would have been too much, and any less would have been pointless.  But as it stands, they did it just right.  Mom did bring up one glaring plothole, though--if Jack Sparrow had been carrying around that pistol for 10 years, and it had gotten wet several times, how in the world did it still fire?  Water would have rendered the powder useless, not to mention the effect salt water has on metal.  Ah well--it was still a fun movie, with great performances all around (though Johnny Depp steals the show, of course).  Clif, Scott, and I went bowling this afternoon.  I've been bowling twice in the past few weeks, though before that I hadn't been bowling in a year or two I think.  I didn't do very well either time--last time, with Jess, Dom, and Beth, I bowled consistently in the 70-90 range.  Today, I bowled in the 70-90 range.  I may suck, but at least I suck consistently.  I also played some basketball today.  A couple of games of Twenty-one, both of which Clif won, and a little one-on-one with Scott, which I won.  The freethrow contest we had afterwards we've both vowed to never speak of again, because it was simply embarassing for all involved.  Anyway, not much of excitement or note going on up here in Ponca City.  We're heading home tomorrow, from the sound of it.  I'm actually going to go to church on Sunday for the first time since my pastor retired several months ago.  We apparently have a woman interum pastor, which has led to problems not within the congregation, but with the praise band we had playing at our early morning services (because they were Baptist and apparently did not like the idea of a woman holding a position of authority in the church...so much so that they'd leave the room when she was preaching, which we thought was rather tacky.  But they've left now, so it's all a moot point).  Sometime middle of next week, I'll head back to Norman, where I can resume more regular internet access.  Oh, to have high-speed internet again.  The first thing I'm going to do is download music.  Not because I'm in desperate need of new music, but just because I can.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: None, and I'm really starting to miss music

       "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)"   Well, a Merry Christmas to everyone out there.  It's been a good couple of days.  Got home Tuesday, got the oil changed in the car because it was in dire need.  Yesterday, got a haircut (there were certain elements of my family--namely, my mother--who felt I needed a bit of a trim), and then we celebrated Christmas Eve with my paternal grandparents, paternal aunt and uncle and their son, his wife, and his daughter.  I spent a good portion of the evening entertaining Bailey, my cousin's daughter.  Then this morning, we got up, did the presents thing at home, and came up to Ponca City to visit the maternal grandparents.  We also joined some old family friends, the Counters, for dinner, where I again entertained a small child; this time it was Taylor, the Counters' granddaughter.  So yeah, I played babysitter.  Weeeeee.  Actually, I like kids.  They tend to like me, too.  Never really understood why.  But it's been a good Christmas.  Also got some nifty stuff, such as Final Fantasy Tactics Advance (which has me feeling warm and fuzzy in very personal places), Fellowship of the Ring Extended Edition (very groovy), Pirates of the Caribbean and Finding Nemo (good stuff, good stuff), and, perhaps most impressive, a new home theatre system.  Anyway, I hope everyone's had a great holiday, and that you all got to be with those who matter most to you.  I'm headin' back home this weekend, and back to Norman a few days later.  See folks soon.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, "Taxman (Live)"

       "Three, Two, One: Let's Jam"   Yeah, I meant to go home this evening.  Honest.  Instead, I'm still in Norman.  I decided I wanted to come back to an at least semi-clean apartment after Christmas, so I stuck around to clean.  And then decided to watch a movie halfway through cleaning.  Because I'm an idiot like that.  Ah well.  I'll get most everything cleaned before bed, hopefully, and take off nice and early tomorrow and head on home.  Sounds like I have lots to do while there--most go mail a package back to a company that arrived at home instead of here.  See, I've been waiting for it for like a month, and it never arrived.  So I emailed the company, they sent me another.  Then, while talking to mom on the phone this evening, I discover it's been sitting at home for over a week and she just kept forgetting to tell me.  Well, in the meantime, the other copy that the company sent me has arrived, so I now have two when I only paid for one.  So I'm going to mail the one back that arrived at my folks' house.  Anyway, returning to topic from tangent...I also need to see about getting a haircut and getting my oil changed while at home.  Thankfully, I don't have any Christmas shopping that needs to be done (dad's present arrived in the mail tonight, thankfully).  That means I get to asiduously avoid the mall for the next three or four weeks.  Joy.  Anyway, I really should get back to cleaning.  The living room is still a pit.  So's the bedroom.  Oddly enough, the bathroom and the computer room are both quite clean, which is a truly rare and wonderful thing.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Badly Drawn Boy, "Something to Talk About"

       "We're Going Home"   Well, here in an hour or two, I'll be heading home for ye ol' holidays.  I'll be in Shawnee until Thursday, when we're going up to visit the grandparents in Ponca City.  Up there for a couple of days, then back down to Shawnee for a couple more, then back here to Norman where we have something resembling civilization (well, my computer and stuff, at least, and that's close enough to civilization for me).  Anyway, I'm sorta torn about going home.  On the one hand, free laundry, good food, no worries, and family.  On the other, no real bed, very little to do (it's Shawnee, and no one's going to be around except family), and my family is there.  That family, always such a double-edged sword.  Granted, just because I'm torn over going home doesn't mean I'm not going home.  I think I'd never live it down if I missed Christmas.  Besides, I'd get bored sleeping, eating, watching anime, and reading books here in Norman by myself after a while.  A week or two, tops, I'm sure.  Meh, not that any of it matters.  I'm still going after I've jogged, showered, and the mail arrives (hopefully with my father's Christmas present in it.  I'd really have to have to give him an IOU for his Christmas present).  Anyway, off for adventure and really wild things!  Well, running, at least.  That's really about it.  Yes, I'm a boring person.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Glen Phillips, "Greer Zoller"

       "You just insulted the Holy Trilogy. Oh, it’s on now."   It's a rather lazy day.  I should probably be cleaning the apartment, or doing something constructive.  But I don't really feel like it.  Instead, I'm lounging around, as I have ever since I woke up at 11.30 this morning to my cellphone ringing (it was Wendy, so I didn't mind, though she probably thinks I've taken up smoking a pack of unfiltered cigarettes a day, because I still had my "I just woke up and having had a chance for my throat to start operating like normal" voice.  I always sound awful first thing in the morning, especially since I've been sick).  I think I'm going to go jog here in a minute (something I've been lax about for the past two weeks, though it's not entirely my fault--inclement weather and illness have played a big part in all but two missed running days.  Those other two days were missed due to laziness, though).  Anyway, I'm probably heading homeward tomorrow.  Home, where my thoughts escape me, home, where my music's playin', home, where my...well, not love, but probably my mom is waiting, and probably not silently, for me.  Kudos and ten bonus points to anyone who can identify the song I'm riffing on here.  Actually, this weekend, now that I think about it, has been very, very good, despite the fact that I was not in Arkansas as I desperately wanted to be.  Why did I want to be in AR?  Well, for the gathering.  Chris and JP were there.  The two Amandas were there, of course, since they're apparently stuck at work in ye ol' hellhole (read: Wal-Mart) until something like Christmas Eve.  James was there.  Heather was there, though she left today (because she done graduated, yup).  I wanted to be there because it's rare that my group of Ozarks friends are actually all gathered at once anymore.  It shall become even more rare, as so many of them graduate and finish up and otherwise depart this year.  As previously mentioned, Heather's done.  Chris and JP I'll get to see (got to talk to them on the phone a bit last night, and they're going to be in Oklahoma for New Year's), but the rest of them...not for a while, probably.  Hell, I don't even get to see Wendy this Christmas--she has to work (curse her theatre for having a show on Christmas Even  and  Christmas Day.  What the hell?).  Amanda Erisman departs in May, as does Bob.  I think Adam does as well, though I think he'll still be around Clarksville.  That leaves...Adam, Amanda Webster, Monica, and Clif, who won't be around this coming semester 'cause he'll be in France, making fun of the French.  It's sad seeing circles disperse, and even broken in a way.  Though I also know the circle will remain unbroken, just...broader.  Now the circle emcompasses the majority of this nation.  I have friends from coast to coast.  North and South, East and West.  Yes, my friends are cast to the four winds, as it were, but that just means new and exciting places I get to visit them in when I can find the funds.  This is not the ending of things, it is the beginning of something new.  Like I said early early this morning, a journey or a new adventure has to begin with a parting.  Doesn't make it easier, of course, but I think I'll survive.  Oh, and if anyone is looking for what to get me for a late Christmas or early birthday gift,  urlLink this  would be cool.  They had a set of posters from a tour he did with Van Morrison and Joni Mitchell available, but apparently those are sold out.  Which is too bad, because those were the ones I really wanted.  I'd have invaded a small country and single-handedly conquered it for those.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Yoko Kanno & the Seatbelts, "The Egg and I"

       "Recovering The Satellites"   I've been thinking alot about Hero Journeys lately.  Well, I say "lately," but what I really mean is "ever since I started discussing Return of the King with Everett this afternoon" (yesterday afternoon, I guess it is now...cursed early a.m. hours).  As I said earlier, I really think Sam is the hero of  Lord of the Rings .  He's not the only hero, of course--you can't swing a dead orc without hitting a hero in  Lord of the Rings --but he's the one that I indentify with most, I guess.  So many of the characters take a hero journey, something I have not the proper vocabulary to describe (though I've read some Joseph Campbell, so I'm familiar with the idea).  Many hero journeys start with a mentor or father figure or guide pointing the way for the hero, and then a parting of ways.  The hero must strike out on his or her own in hopes of growing and becoming a man/woman/fill-in-the-blank-alien-gender.  Then the hero returns to his home carrying the knowledge and wisdom he has gained on his journey.  It's one of those nice archetypal cycles that Campbell always drooled over.  That Ev drools over.  That Tolkein loaded his books with.  And all this has got me wondering--am I on my own journey?  Have I set other people on theirs?  I know Ev was talking about rediscovering a part of himself in recent weeks, and I've discussed it with him at length.  A rather conceited part of me likes to think that I'm somehow parly responsible for this.  I'm probably not, though.  I also like to think I've been a mentor to a few of my friends, who probably thought I've just been overbearing and overprotective.  Mostly, the hero journey idea has got me thinking about partings.  I hate saying goodbye, I always have.  I don't like lettig go.  I bawled the day I left Ozarks.  I don't even want to think about what this coming May will be like.  I haven't been here long, and I only know a few people, but I think I've gotten rather close to those few in that short time, and they're an important part of my life now.  Hell, it was tough enough saying goodbye to Beth at the airport this afternoon, and that's only for a few weeks.  What happens when or if I have to say goodbye for good?  I hate that idea.  One of the more touching scenes in the early Terry Pratchett Discworld books comes at the end of  Mort .  In context, it doesn't seem very touching; it's a conversation between Death and his former apprentice, Mort, over deviled eggs at a wedding reception.  But taken by itself:  "Goodbye," Mort said, and was surprised to find a lump in his throat.  "It's such an unpleasant word, isn't it?" QUITE SO.  Death grinned because, as has so often been remarked, he didn't have much option.  But possibly he meant it, this time. I PREFER AU REVOIR, MYSELF, he said.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Yoko Kanno & the Seatbelts, "Tank!"

       "One Ring To Rule The Boxoffice...Or Something"   It's 3.20am.  Guess what movie I just got back from seeing?  I'll give you a hint--it wasn't Gothika.  That's right--I finally got to see Return of the King.  Words...well, words simply fail.  I can't say anything about this movie that hasn't already been said by someone infinitely more eloquent than I.  Suffice to say it actually brought tears to my eyes at a few points, and for a movie to do that--for  anything  to do that--is impressive indeed.  And these weren't tears of rage or frustration or dying dreams, such as were wept during Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, or Matrix Revolutions.  No, these were tears of bittersweet joy.  Joy for realizing that Peter Jackson was my new hero for not screwing up his remarkable trilogy, and bittersweet because I know it's over now and there's nothing left of it except the extended version to come out this time next year.  Oh yes, I shall be purchasing that, and referring to it as "precious" in a most gratuotous manner.  So yeah, ROTK rocked my tiny middle America world.  As stated, it actually made me cry.  Only a few things can make me actually cry, for one reason or another.  They are:  (1) Getting kicked in the wedding tackle (this will make even the strongest man tear up, trust me) (2) Highly emotional music or moment in a movie/TV series.  The song "Blue" from the Cowboy Bebop soundtrack always brings a lump to my throat, and I get all misty-eyed.  Likewise, the ending of Cowboy Bebop (the anime) really got to me, as did the final strains of the Beatles' "The End," wherein McCartney sings, "And in the end, the love you take/is equal to the love you make."  Such a fitting end to their final album (well, the last one recorded, though not the last one released--Let it Be has that distinction). (3) Extreme, intense emotion.  Perfect example was when I graduated from Ozarks.  I was fine until I actually got out on I40, and it hit me that I was gone.  Cried like a baby all the way to Ft. Smith.  ROTK fit into category 2 and 3, in a way.  The last hour was just so damn poignant, even amidst battle scenes.  Also, it occurred to me--not for the first time--that the hero of the story is not Frodo.  Nor is it Aragorn or Gandalf or any of them.  It's Sam.  Sam is, in a word, the Man.  Without him, Frodo never would have made it, the Ring would not have been destroyed, and the whole story would have taken a drastically different turn.  But he was along for the ol' ride, carrying Frodo when Frodo could no longer carry himself.  Sam is the heart and soul of the books and the films, the emotional and spiritual glue that holds the whole edifice together.  In closing, ROTK is a wonderful, wonderful movie.  I can't wait to see it again.  I can't wait for the extended version, which is rumored to be something like 5 hours long.  Dear God, five hours.  That's a big chunk of your day there.  With the other two extended versions, that'll be one hell of a movie marathon.  I, for one, can't wait to do it.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Anything from the Return of the King Soundtrack

       "Junk's Piling Up, Taking Up Space"   My apartment is a bloody pit.  Which is sad, considering I just cleaned most of it up earlier this week.  Or was it late last week?  I can't actually remember now.  I don't really know how I build up clutter so fast.  I mean, there's just one of me.  I spend most of my time at work or otherwise out of the apartment.  And when I am in the apartment, I spend a good amount of time at the computer or asleep.  So how does crap get piled up everywhere?  I'd like to say that the apartment will be cleaned sometime in the near future.  And that may very well be true, but I'm not going to bet a lot of money on it.  I do at least need to take the trash out and clean up the living room again, so that it's...er...liveable.  Tomorrow is going to be a marathon day.  Up at a decent hour, to campus to return books and pick up paycheck, then off to the bank and the movie theatre to get movie tickets for ye ol' Return of the King.  Then over to Beth's at some point in the afternoon, where she's hosting a showing of the first two Lord of the Rings films.  The extended versions, naturally.  Which, oddly enough, I still have not seen either of.  I'm sure I'm remiss in my duties as a geek because of this.  I know I'm terrible, and will have my geek status revoked or something, but I've been busy, honest.  Anyway, it's going to be a busy weekend, I know that.  Saturday, I'm taking Beth to the airport so she can go home for Christmas.  Then I'm showing Ev disc three of Blue Seed.  Then on Sunday, I'm possibly taking Dom to the airport so he can go home to Boston, then I'm going to try and see Bubba-Ho Tep, which is apparently playing out at the Lloyd Noble Center (the university's basketball arena down the street).  Seeing Bubba-Ho Tep would rock, as I've heard only good things about it.  And because Bruce "Don't Call Me Ash" Campbell is like a tiny, manly-chinned god.  That, and I never did get to see Bob Dylan's Masked and Anonymous, so I feel I ought to get to see one semi-obscure film this year, dammit.  Speaking of "obscure" films, I watched the Great Escape tonight.  It's not obscure, but it's a bit older (1963), and has Steve McQueen, James Gardner, Richard Attenborough, James Coburn, and Charles Bronson in it.  Very quality film.  I really want to find a copy of Papillion, which features McQueen and Dustin Hoffman.  I saw a couple of years ago while working for my dad.  It was on one of those Classic Movie channels one night while we were sitting in the hotel with nothing to do, and there were no decent baseball games on.  So I watched it, and it kicked ass.  Steve McQueen is the man.  Anyway, Long Live the King!  He Returns!  Woo!  Yeah, I'm excited about finally seeing this damn film.  It'll be nice to have a trilogy that doesn't disappoint me.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Sheryl Crow, "Mississippi"

       "You Can Ponder Perpetual Motion"   Today's been a damn fine day.  There is little to complain about, really, which just makes me wonder when the other boot will fall.  I actually got sleep last night, unlike the previous night when I was troubled by body aches.  Nothing of that sort last night, no-sirree.  Nothin' but good, honest-to-God sleep!  And then I worked this morning.  But that was okay, because it wasn't much work, really.  It's gotten quiet at work now, as I knew it would as finals week progresses.  Most of the papers and such are completed, so we're pretty quiet.  Then I got to go have lunch with Libbie "Pixie" Okey, whom I haven't seen since like April.  And we attend the same bloody school.  That should never be the case, y'know?  If you go to the same school as someone, you should see them occasionally.  But such is life.  I'm always busy with work and research and the like, and she's a theatre major.  I think that ought to tell you all you need to know.  Anyway, after a good lunch with her, I went home and slept.  I slept like a demon, though how demons sleep is beyond me.  Rather uncomfortably, I'd think, given that they're demons and in Hell and it's rather uncomfortable in Hell.  Okay, so I didn't sleep like a demon, per se, but I slept well for like three more hours.  It was nice.  Then a call from the insurance company comes, and it turns out that there'll be no hassle involved in getting my car repaired, for which I am very joyful.  Hell, it's even possible there could be negative hassle, that this will actually be more convenient for me than if my car hadn't been hit.  Okay, that's a lie.  But it's still going to be relatively painless, which I like.  Oh, and I finally tracked down both Dirk Gently novels last night, and went ahead and purchased them (working under the assumption that I should probably grab them before someone else did, because Lord knows when I'll be able to find them again).  So yeah, it's been a good day, I guess.  And last night was a good night.  Everything's just comin' up Millhouse, I guess.  Or something similar, anyway.  And tomorrow and Friday, I don't have to work.  I get to sleep in.  That, my friends, is pure bliss.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: CCR, "Around the Bend"

       "Waiting For The Other Boot To Fall"   I think I'm getting sick.  This obviously annoys me.  I don't get sick very often, for which I am very thankful.  But I only slept a total of about two hours last night--and those nonconsecutive--because of a bizzare ache in my right shoulder.  An ache I'm associating with the flu, possibly.  As it stands, my throat's been a bit sore, I've been coughing, and there's more phlem in my throat than I really want to think about.  Not only that, but I'm feeling very, very warm right now...though that's probably because my boss left the thermostats set at about 76 or so yesterday afternoon, so it's just bloody warm here at work.  But anyway, no matter how I slept last night, I was uncomfortable.  That wasn't fun.  I don't plan on a repeat of that tonight or anytime soon.  On to other exciting things!  I did laundry last night.  If I keep doing laundry at the pace I have been (I did a couple of loads Saturday night and one load last night), I'll eventually have more clean clothes than dirty.  This is currently not the case, but we're getting to about half and half.  Currently I feel like a character out of a story Dav's been writing.  The character has this superpower that causes him to heat up under certain circumstances...and when I say "heat up," I mean "raise body temperature to the point that it melts metal and fries eggs at twenty paces."  I feel like that right now.  I don't know if it's because I have a fever or because my boss had the heat cranked up to 77 (not 76, as I originally thought) by the end of the day yesterday.  Which was really kinda ridiculous, I think, since it was in the 60s outside yesterday.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Glen Phillips, "Easier (Live Acoustic)"

       "Can I Be Electric Too?"   So I woke up this morning with a strange urge to listen to  Oasis .  I know, I'm a bad, terrible person.  But I can't help it--sure, they're Britpop knock-offs, ripping off Beatles tunes and tropes left and right, with nary an original thought in their little pinheads, but damn, they can make some decent-sounding music.  I mean, when you decided to consciously "borrow" from the greatest band ever (the Beatles, for those of you not keeping track), it's hard not to sound good, if just a  wee bit  derivative.  Admittedly, I really only wanted to hear one of their songs, which actually sounds more like Dylan channeled through the Beatles--"She's Electric."  A good tune, to be sure, and sounds an awful lot like Dylan circa  Highway 61 Revisited .  I've never understood why I like Oasis.  I mean, they make decent pop-rock, but there's little substance to it.  I guess they just "write" catchy pop songs.  It's hard not to enjoy the music, really, even if it's derivative as hell and completely unoriginal.  It still  sounds  good.  But I'm making up for it by listening to Van Morrison next.  And probably Dylan as well (I'm hooked on  Time out of Mind ...again).  Meanwhile, I'm still in the middle of Terry Pratchett's  Small Gods .  It occurs to me that I really need to get some new books.  I'd like Douglas Adams' Dirk Gently books,  Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency  and  The Long, Dark Teatime of the Soul .  Sadly, all I can find at any bookstore is the latter.  I also need to pick up a new copy of Ursla K. LeGuinn's  Wizard of Earthsea , as someone borrowed my original copy and never returned it (and damned if I know who it was, exactly).  There are also other, new Earthsea books I don't have (I have all the original four except the aforementioned first book,  Wizard ).  Those shall be mine someday.  Oh yeah, and the rest of the  New Jedi Order  books.  I started reading those several years ago when they first came out, but lost track when they released one of them in hardback (I'm cheap--I usually only buy books in paperback), so I got behind.  Then I started reading Pratchett, and never got the chance to go back.  Well, now they've just released the final book in the series, though it's admittedly in hardback.  That's okay, though--I still have over a dozen books in paperback to read between where I stopped in the series and where they are currently.  Anyway, back to  Small Gods .  Remember-- the Turtle Moves!   ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Oasis, "She's Electric"

       "The Turtle Moves!"   Well, it was a rather successful weekend...aside from, like, the nasty weather Friday.  I spent most of Friday doing not much of anything except cleaning up around the apartment (something that desperately needed to happen).  Saturday was spent basically hanging out with friends.  From noon until 6.00, I hung out with Ev and his circle o' friends (of whom I only knew a couple when I first got there, but that was okay, because it was still fun).  After that, I ran home for a bit to wrap presents for Jess and Dom.  Beth came over to assist (and wrap her own presents for Rink y Dink), and gave me my Christmas present--a Newsboys Greatest Hits CD.  I'm not overly familiar with the band, though I have heard of them (contemporary Christian pop-rock stuff).  What I've heard of it thusfar, I've liked.  Anyway, after we got presents wrapped, we headed over to Jess and Dom's, got them, and went to eat dinner at Tarahamaru's, our favorite Mexican restaurant.  After stuffing ourselves beyond reasonable capacity, we headed back to Jess and Dom's place for a quick game of Trival Pursuit.  After that, we went out bowling.  I haven't been bowling in a year or two.  Hence, I didn't play too well (never broke 100...hell, never broke 90, and we played like four games).  Also discovered I'm a terrible bowler left handed (something Beth and I tried out on a whim--turns out she's actually just as good if not better with her left hand than with her right).  So that lasted until about 2.00am, then we headed back to Jess and Dom's, sat and chatted for like an hour, then headed home.  Then sleep, my dear companion sleep.  I slept until noon today, when I was rudely called from bed by the telephone.  Mom.  So I sat and chatted with her for half an hour, got up, eventually drug myself to the shower, cleaned up, and came to work.  And here I sit.  Woo, work.  We're hoping it'll be quiet here tonight.  I mean really hoping.  I have to be here for eight full hours (2.00 to 10.00), and don't really feel like exerting myself any more than what it takes to occasionally type or turn the pages of the book I'm reading (Terry Pratchett's  Small Gods , a wonderful book that I think everyone going into the clergy or some religious-related field ought to read).  Yes, I'm lazy, but mom said to do things you're good at, and I've had lots of practice.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Newsboys, "Shine"

       "Maybe This Year Will Be Better Than The Last"   Mmmm... lukewarm chocolate.  Y'know, you go in expecting to be able to get hot chocolate, only the water isn't hot, so it's really more of cold or lukewarm chocolate.  Then you have to find a microwave to heat it up, only you can't heat it up too much or the cup will melt (damn styrofoam).  So your chocloate is now marginally warmer, only still kinda cold, and not as rich and creamy as you'd like because it's made with water and has no milk in it.  So you're left with sort-okay chocolate, but you drink it anyway because it's free and because you have nothing else to drink and no money to purchase something else until after work when you can go pick up your paycheck.  Such is my morning thusfar.  I think it says, everything, really.  It probably doesn't help that the last time I had hot chocolate (a couple of weeks ago, the Monday after Thanksgiving, actually), it was homemade by Beth and very, very tasty.  Guess I got spoiled.  Wow.  All that's left of this semester is Finals Week.  Craziness.  I can't believe the semster is already over.  One more, and I'm done at this school.  God only knows where I'll be next.  This frightens me a bit.  I'm not usually one for planning things far in advance, but I do like to know I'll have somewhere to go and be this time next year.  And by "someplace" I mean "someplace other than the gutter."  Oh, and I'm ashamed to say that in  urlLink today's comic ,  that is quite possibly the worst drawing of a baby  ever .  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Jack Johnson, "Taylor"

       "Secret Marriage"   So I attended a wedding last night at 1.00am.  Seriously.  No, it wasn't mine, and no, it didn't occur in Las Vegas.  It occurred in the Norman Regional Hospital Chapel, which was the closest church-like place we could find at that hour.  But yeah, a couple of my dear friends here at OU tied the ol' knot last night, and I was there as a witness.  The circumstances around why we had to do it at 1.00am are rather simple, actually--the guy doing the ceremony didn't get off work up in the city until midnight or so, so we had to wait for him (apparently my claim to be the Mitten Pope does not necessarily confer upon me special Jesus Powers).    But anyway, it was a nice little ceremony, only took a few minutes.  It amazes me how those few little minutes will change these two persons' lives.  I mean, they've been dating for like six years, engaged for the past two (and cohabitating, too, though it's out of financial necessity rather than the need for nookie), and yet...a quick little ceremony, and suddenly it'll all be just slighty different.  Yet significantly different, I'm sure.  It always makes me feel good to see two people who've found each other amidst all the chaos of this life, especially the chaos of college.  Makes me hope I'll find something like that myself someday.  Enough introspection.  If I start thinking about that, I'll start thinking about the dearth of dates in recent years, and that'll just get me started on a tangent that none of us want to to take.  I've walked that road too many times, and all I ever find are potholes the size of Texas.  Besides, I'm content with my relationship circumstances, for once.  I know that's hard to believe, but I really don't mind being single right now.  What would I have to offer a girl?  "Hey, I proofread papers like a mo-fo, baby.  Does that turn your crank?"  Admittedly, using the phrase "turn your crank" when trying to pick up a lady is probably a swift route to a head injury, but hey, we're speaking hypothetically here.  In completely unrelated news that is apropos of absolutely nothing, I had lunch with my friend Audrey today.  She, like myself, is an Ozarks alum, and now attending grad school here at OU.  Like me, she's having a difficult time adjusting to the intensity of grad-level work.  And being in a big school.  And not knowing many people.  And wondering "how the hell am I gonna make it through this?"  Though I doubt she'd use the word "hell," because she's much more devout and pure person than I.  I am a terrible person, to be honest, just not in ways that really show.  Ev insists I'm not a nice guy at all, though I think it's more than I'm just evil to him.  Which I am.  But he deserves it, honest, and it's not like he can't give as well as he takes.  Now that we've ended up somewhere completely different from where we started, I'll end this farce.  I'm gonna go run before it gets too cold.  Running in sub-zero weather is not unakin to going through puberty in reverse--everything gets sucked back up into your body, and you have to wait for your balls to drop again after you thaw out.  I honestly think my voice goes up about an octave, too.  The preceeding was more information that you could possibly have wanted.  For more disturbing visuals and concepts, stay tuned to this station.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Byrds, "My Back Pages"

       "Thingama Jigsaw Puzzled"   I got to have Indian food last night.  I haven't had Indian food since I was in London a few years back, and man did I miss the stuff.  You have to understand, curry is one of my favorite dishes.  I've had several types of curry--two different Indian curries (the one I had last night was called Chicken Vindaloo, and  damn  was it spicy), Thai curry, Chinese curry, and my mom's version of curry.  They're all different, and I love them all.  I've never been able to adequately explain my love for the stuff.  By all rights, I should hate curry--it's spicy, most recipies have lots of vegetables and the like in them, and it's just...foreign, y'know?  A major part of my basic personality is my intrinsic distrust of anything new and different.  Curry ought to fit that exactly.  Yet I love the stuff.  It's weird.  Ah well.  Suffice to say, I had some damn spicy curry last night, and loved it.  If only the Indian restaurant weren't so expensive, I could eat there more often.  I've been pretty lazy since I finished my paper yesterday morning.  I spent most of yesterday afternoon asleep on the couch, waking up occasionally to hear the wind howling outside around my poorly-insulated apartment building.  Then I went to class and out to dinner with said class, then back to ye ol' apartment.  Nothing particularly exciting, I guess.  I did have an interesting conversation with my professor, though.  I was mentioning that I'd noticed most graduate students are very serious, almost somber and dour people.  They rarely smile, and they never talk about anything that isn't history-related.  Now mind you, I love history, too, and I want to spend the rest of my life doing it, but I also have other interests, and I still smile and laugh a lot.  I think some of our grad students have forgotten how to laugh.  Dr. Lewis thought it had to do with the fact that they're all studying American history, because she thought that would make her pretty boring, too.  But Dr. Lewis pointed out something that Ev had noticed when he and I first had a similar conversation a few months ago--I'm a goofy son of a bitch (those weren't the words she used, but that was the gist).  I grin at the drop of a hat, I laugh at life, and I generally don't let a little thing like reality stand in my way of having a good time.  I am, in short, goofy, and have a heart that won't allow me to be consumed by the weight of my major.  Thus, there's little danger of me becoming like the other grad students in my field.  Now admittedly, as Ev and I first noticed, this might give them more focus than I have.  It might give them some sort of "edge" over me professionally.  But I'll have a life to look back on which is full of wonderful moments and laughter.  They'll have dust and musty rooms full of forgotten words.  Admittedly, I'll have the rooms full of dust and forgotten words, too, but I'll have more.  And I'll still be laughing when they're dead on the inside at 35.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Bruce Springsteen, "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out"

       "Contemporary Music Lacks Zeitgeist"   Well, I got my paper finished this morning, finally.  This was despite the world's best efforts to prevent it from being completed, which included having me act like an empty-headed moron and forgetting the most recent version of the paper on Sunday and having my car hit in the damn parking garage while I was at work last night (car is still drivable, I'm just pissed about it is all).  Anyway, in light of not having much energy or much to talk about, I'll instead give you the opinion article I wrote which appeared in today's  urlLink school paper .  The one thing that annoyed me about the article was that they changed my title, so I present to you the original title of the piece: "Contemporary Music Lacks Zeitgeist" (I'm guessing they probably had to look up Zeitgeist, and that's what annoyed them).  Contemporary music is in a deplorable state.  Look at the evidence—the top pop albums on the charts are by the likes of Britney Spears, who wouldn’t know a decent song if it smacked her in the face and made lewd remarks about her mother.  Or it’s some rap album with lyrics that you can’t understand because they are muttered too fast, though when you can hear them, you wish you couldn’t.  Why?  Because nine times out of ten, the lyrics are about hate, rage, greed, or subjugating women.  When did this happen to music?  When did we sacrifice substance and depth for a shiny, glossy finish?  Most contemporary music is about as substantial as cotton candy.  Where are the meat and potatoes of our mothers and fathers?  We have nu-metal, we have bubblegum pop, we have rap-rock and post-grunge and God knows what else available, and 99.9% of it is all crap.  When Britney cranks out a new single called “Me Against the Music,” she really means it.  Her “songs” are like sonic fingernails across the blackboard of my inner ear.  I think Britney is in a vanguard of “artists” who are attempting to actually destroy music, one empty song at a time.  I’d like to be able to say that it’s the RIAA’s fault.  And, in part, it is—they keep cranking out cookie-cutter artists who all sound alike, all make the same meaningless music, and all have the same no-talent, all physical appearance appeal as the one before them.  But it’s also the consumer’s fault for continuing to buy the crap they put out.  When was the last time you bought a CD and actually liked more than one or two songs on it?  Can you remember what songs were popular two or three months ago?  A year ago?  I can remember what songs were popular in 1965, but not what the top song was last week.  Why is this?  Because the songs in those decades before I was born were actually good.  Not only is the dearth of good music the fault of the record industry and the consumer, but it’s also the fault of the artists themselves.  Few artists are willing to take risks, to break the formulae they establish when they hit it big.  They plod along with the same sound, virtually the same song, for album after album.  Why?  Because the record companies tell them to, and because they don’t want to lose record sales.  It’s all for the nookie, or for the bling-bling, but never for the music or for the fans.    All told, there’s not much to be happy about with contemporary popular music.  It’s devoid of intelligence or substance, with few redeeming qualities or bands.  I weep, for we lack latter-day Dylans, Van Morrisons, and Lennon & McCartneys.  Now if you’ll pardon me, I’m going to go listen to my  Sgt. Pepper’s  LP and remember when music was worth listening to.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Led Zeppelin, "Rock and Roll"

       "Folk With A Beat"   I was noticing something last night, and I'm not even sure why it occurred to me or if there's any sort of etemological connection or not.  The word "music" seems to have the word "muse" at its core, if you ask me.  Is there some tenuous connection there, a link between the idea of personified inspiration and what is often one of mankind's most inspired forms of self-expression?  Perhaps music is the chasing of the muse, following our inspiration where it leads us, down the road behind the great bluesmen.  Ever wonder where music really came from?  Who figured out, centuries and centuries ago, that if you blew into this hollow thing just right, and covered these specific holes that happened to be in it, it would make a pleasing sound?  Or that you could make noise with your mouth and throat that would also sound pleasing, which could express such emotion and life that you could lose yourself in it?  Music almost can't be put into words.  The lyricist's job, as with the job of the poet or the writer of any sort, is to attempt to put into words that which cannot be said, to express the ideas and emotions that all of us feel and yet cannot ever adequately explain to another human being.  Theirs is a nigh impossible job, though occasionally you get someone--Lennon and McCartney, Harrison, Van Morrison, Dylan, Louis Armstrong and the like--who can tap into something basic in the human psyche and become an Everyman, the troubadore who carries the message of the people to the people.  I hope myself to be able to do that through my various artistic enterprises.  If artists of words and pictures are the ones chasing the muse, expressing human inspiration and human longings, then I want to follow that path myself.  I want to say what cannot be said, and instill the sense of wonder and awe in the world that I feel in others as well.  I want to be the messenger who cannot be ignored or turned away, not just a voice crying out in the wilderness.  I want the world to see the muse dancing in my mind, and to follow the tune I set.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Gorillaz, "19/2000 (Soulchild Remix)"

       "The Whole F*ckin' World's Against Us, Dude"   I swear, it's true.  This evening, at work, I fully intended to write several pages on my twenty page paper due Tuesday.  So, I insert my disk, pull up its contents, load up my paper...  ...and discover that the version that's on the disk is an old, incomplete version of the paper.  Dammit.  That totally kills my ability to work on the damn thing, because I don't remember what corrections/adjustments/changes I've made since this version was made.  I've got the most recent version saved on my computer back at the apartment, but that really doesn't help me in the next three and a half hours of work.  Dammit.  Beyond that, things aren't too bad.  There's the distinct possibility that I will own the Opinion page in tomorrow's  urlLink school newspaper , with both a comic and an article about the state of pop music.  The comic is virtually guaranteed, the article is still in question.  We'll see what happens.  Could be fun if it ends up in there.  In other news, I am listening to Led Zeppelin, the greatest straight rock band ever (the Beatles are pop-rock, and in a genre all their own.  Zep is straight ahead, no holds barred rock and roll).  Their fourth album, known colloquially as "Zoso" (for one of the symbols in its inocuous title), is one of the greatest albums ever committed to a sound recording.  Every song on it is a classic, with the exception of the boring and just plain blah "Battle of Evermore," which of course runs on for much longer than it has any business or reason to last.  But we can forgive that, because it has "Black Dog," "Rock and Roll," "Stairway to Heaven," "Going to California," "Misty Mountain Hop," and "When the Levee Breaks."  Those six songs, along with the acceptable "Four Sticks," make this an amazing album (how many CDs in the past decade or so can you say at least 3/4 of was absolutely brilliant?  I thought so).  Ah well.  Maybe I'll go back to working on that short story I started earlier.  Got nothing else to do, it would seem.  Dammit.  Addendum: I am indeed going to have an article in the school paper tomorrow.  Should be interesting.  Addendum Redux: Apparently I was misled.  My stuff will not appear Monday, but Tuesday, I believe.  Yes, Tuesday.  I mean, they made me come over and get my damn picture taken for this stupid article, so it damn well  better  run.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Led Zeppelin, "Stairway to Heaven"

       "I Sighed A Million Sighs, I Told A Million Lies To Myself"   Lots of random ground to cover.  Let's see how it goes.  Ran in another race with Dad this morning.  Unlike the Thanksgiving Day race, this one was only 5K (a little over three miles), which is about what I run every day anyway.  Which is why I was so annoyed with myself for not doing well in it.  I should have been able to finish the thing in under 30 minutes.  I think we pulled a 33 1/2 minute time, and then I threw up.  Literally.  I've only thrown up once in the pastabout six years before today.  That time was at Pike's Peak, when altitude sickness played merry hell on my body.  Anyway, the point is, I should not have struggled with a race this short.  But I did.  I think it was a combination of things.  First, we were running faster than I have been of late.  I've been managing a terrible mile time, and I know it.  Second, it was early in the morning.  I hate morning runs.  I never do well in them, regardless of the distance.  My legs just can't get loosened up; they stay tight and uncooperative.  Third, it was pretty damn cold, which really affected me at first because it made it tough to breath when I was still able to run at a reasonable pace.  My first two kilometers were actually right on pace--six minutes apiece--but the next one was more like eight and a half minutes.  Long story short, I struggled through a three mile run that I should have done without breathing hard.  Instead, I not only was breathing hard, but having to stop and walk, having to puke at the end, and now my legs hurt like hell.  All I can say is that I really need to shape back up.  I wouldn't have any problem with distance or the speed at which we needed to run if I were in better shape, and that's really all there is to it.  The other things--the earliness of the run, the pace, the cold--would have had negligible impact if I were in better shape.  Hopefully Clif can get me back on track during Christmas Break.  I'm not particularly happy with the way my rant yesterday turned out.  I was sorta distracted when I wrote it, and only worked on it in bits and pieces.  I'll try re-writing it in the next few days, when I get the chance.  I've noticed that my two Wal-Mart bookshelves are sagging a bit.  Granted, they're both completely full of history books.  I guess particle board just can't handle the weight of history.  I appear to have gotten my friend Dav hooked on webcomics.  I'd feel bad about it if I weren't cackling with glee.  See, I'm of the impression that the only thing standing between humanity and total humorlessness in sequential art is the webcomic.  We are the last bastion of humor in a world of comic strips which have decided they'd rather play it safe with jokes that are so watered down that they appeal to the lowest common denominator but no longer make us laugh.  This, my friends, is a sad state.  The print comic seems to be dying.  They are printed smaller and smaller, meaning comic artists have less space to work with.  People get offended if any view other than that of the conservative WASP of middle America is expressed in a comic.  When was the last time a comic you saw in the newspaper made you genuinely laugh out loud?  Back when Calvin and Hobbes and the Far Side were in print, wasn't it?  Webcomics are great, though, because they do not have the restrictions which traditional print comics have on them.  If your work offends someone in a webcomic, chances are, they can just stop reading the thing.  It's not like they paid money to read it, usually (there are exceptions, but I don't like paying money for webcomics, because I get the feeling that no one would pay money to read mine).  Webcomics have a huge amount of space to play with, and can utilize a full-page format if so desired.  Plus, we have the advantage of archives--you can go back and read the old comics without having to purchase a book, though more and more webcomics are printing and publishing their work in book collections now because they can include all sorts of nifty extras with it (I know  urlLink Megatokyo ,  urlLink Sinfest ,  urlLink Sluggy Freelance , and many others all have books collecting past strips available, though said strips are also still available in the website archives).  In short, webcomics are superior to print comics.  Well, the good webcomics are.  There's also a lot of crap out there, since anyone can slap together a website and publish their work, regardless of its quality (and with free hosting sites such as  urlLink Keenspace  out there allowing anyone and everyone a place for their "work," it's sometimes difficult to sift through the crap to find the gems).  But despite the glut of webcomics, it's still possible to find a good number which are excellent.  My favorites include:   urlLink Penny Arcade : the first webcomic I started reading, and still one of my favorites  urlLink College Roomies From Hell!!!! : the best college comic out there, period  urlLink It's Walky! : epic Sci-Fi adventure, and funny to boot  urlLink Something Positive : disturbingly funny, and so very, very wrong.  Not for those who are easily offended  urlLink Count Your Sheep : a Keenspace comic that has the whimsy of Calvin and Hobbes and one of the cutest premises I've ever seen  urlLink Ignorance Deserves Death : the title says it all.  Another comic for mature audiences only.  Really  urlLink Shaw Island : this guy has an amazing thing for dialogue.  And talking hamsters.  Also does  urlLink American Animetion , which is also really cool  urlLink Life of Riley : it features a succubus.  It features the vampire son of Al Gore.  It features an artist named Dan who gains power by learning how to do math  urlLink 8-Bit Theatre : the only sprite comic I truly love  urlLink The Jaded : a gritty tale of a mercenary group based out of London.  Ping rocks your socks  urlLink Applegeeks : brilliantly written and drawn, and punctual.  Just wish it updated more than once a week...  urlLink Blade Kitten : just...wow.  This guy's art  rocks .  urlLink Mac Hall : another brilliantly drawn and written comic.  It never fails to make me laugh out loud.  If only it updated consistantly  urlLink Mixed Myth : a wonderfully whimsical look at mythology, fantasy, and the conventions thereof  urlLink Dim Bulb Comics : simply the best comics on the internet.  Period ;-)  There are others that I read that I didn't list here, not because I don't like them, but because I read something like sixty different webcomics, and if I listed them all, we'd be here all day.  There are some big ones on the list, such as Penny Arcade and Mac Hall and 8-Bit Theatre, but most of these you probably haven't heard of (unless you're like me or James).  There was a point to that--I wanted to introduce some of the lesser-known comics that're out there so they could get some more notice.  They deserve it, let me tell you.  Besides, maybe karma will work for me, and if I send readers to other comics, more readers will come my way.  It's worth a shot.  Oh, and never shop at Wal-Mart on a Saturday afternoon between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  It's just...not worth it.  At all.  ~chaos cricket  Van Morrison, "I Wanna Roo You (Scottish Derivative)"

       "But The Moment Never Came"   Ever notice how we spend so much of our lives waiting for the right moment to come along?  Lord knows it's been one of the defining characteristics of my life.  I'm always waiting for just the right time--to do something, to ask a girl out, to actually make my life something.  And, ironically, while I wait for life to begin, or for something to signal that this is the moment when my life should begin, my life is actually slipping away, one "wrong" moment at a time.  You know, there are actually people out there who make their own right moments.  Who do things, who make active choices.  Guess you could call them Neitzsche's ubermensch, actualized human beings who are masters of their own will and destiny.  Me, I keep letting the flow of the day to day carry me along in the drifting current, never really doing anything that bucks the trend or the current.  Sure, it makes me kinda Taoist, but it doesn't help me ever change my situation in life, does it?  And that's probably what needs to happen.  I become very complacent very quick.  It explains my weight problems--as soon as I get comfortable, and stop pushing myself, I start eating a lot, I stop watching what I eat and when I eat it, and I balloon up like Oprah.  That's like a physical, tangible metaphor for my entire existence, I think, which is rather disturbing.  Thing is, I'm not really even sure how to go about making drastic changes in my life anymore.  I guess going far off for grad school is a big step.  Just have to get accepted first, really.  But that change really scares me--the thought that I might be heading off for a place where I know no one, and end up spending all my time sitting in my apartment, or class, or the library, doing nothing social, never meeting people or making new friends.  I mean, sure, once I actually start meeting people, I have no problems making friends.  I'm a very amiable person, really, and I like to think that I can get along with almost anyone and that I'm rather likeable.  It's just a matter of putting myself out there.  Really, the only reason I had a lot of friends in both high school and college was that other people grabbed hold of me first, and I just sort of got dragged into circles.    But I guess I'll just have to see how all that turns out.  As much as I want to be a master of my own destiny and make all sorts of important decisions, grad school is sorta out of my hands with the applications sent off.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Flaming Lips, "Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell"

       "The Outside Might Just Bleed Its Way In"   One thing above all others really annoys me.  Yes, stupidity does, but I can accept that as just something the stupid person has no control over; after all, if they had control over it, they wouldn't be stupid.  No, what truly pushes my buttons, every single time, is when someone makes an assumption.  Admittedly, I make them quite often.  That's probably part of why they bother me so much.  But what I'm really talking about are assumptions about generosity and the like.  For instance, yesterday, a student-athlete was trying to print something.  He didn't know how to install our printer to his user profile, so instead, he just walked over to the computer I was logged on to (I was sitting at the desk at the time proofreading a paper), closed down the file I had open and proceeded to try and access his disk.  About this time, I became aware of what he was doing, and berated him for messing with a computer that was clearly in use.  He muttered something, and I told him to ask next time.  He couldn't understand why it bothered me so much.  Why does it bother me so much?  I'm not really sure.  I don't mind doing things for people, being generous to damn near anyone who asks for generosity.  But it rubs me the wrong way whenever someone just assumes I will generous without asking first.  They assume I won't mind if they use my computer, or give them a ride (the particular incident that refers to has been resolved, though, so no worries, Ev--this isn't a personal attack), or anything like that.  I reiterate--I don't mind being generous.  In fact, I'm more than willing.  But I have to be asked, or I have to offer--someone just assuming that I'll do fill in the blank action for them is the quickest way to get me in a bad mood.    Really, I think my distaste for stupidty stems from this as well.  The type of stupidity that really annoys me is learned helplessness, where people are incapable of doing or thinking for themselves and instead become dependent on someone else to do it all for them.  Willful ignorance, if you will.  They just assume someone else will take care of their problems for them.  The biggest example of this is that some of the athletes I have to deal with assume that just because we're here to proofread their papers, they don't need to perform any proofreading of their own, that we're just machines to do their work for them.  And that always leaves me mad.  I don't mind working with a student and a paper that the student has put time and effort into.  On the contrary, I am more than happy to put forth effort if the student has.  But not if the student doesn't care about the paper.  If they don't, why should I?  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Van Morrison, "Somerset"

       "A Long December"   It's hard to believe that it's already December.  Finals are in about a week and a half.  Granted, I don't have finals (I have a 20 page paper to turn in, but that's due the week before, so that doesn't really count).  But it's almost finals week.  It's almost the end of the semester already.  Eesh.  It never ceases to amaze me how time seems to move faster now than it did when I was younger.  As a small child, minutes seemed to drag by for an eternity.  Hours were like the migration of glaciers.  An ice age could come and go during a full day.  The weekend always seemed eons away, unreachable except by someone with Methusalah-like age who managed to survive the hundreds of years each weekday seemed to last.  Granted, the weekends still went by like the blink of the proverbial eye, even as a child, but that's relativity for you.  Now, of course, there never seem to be enough hours in the day.  Maybe it's because I'm trying to cram more into each day, whereas when I was a child, there weren't that many demands on my time--school, homework (when I bothered with it), play, eat, sleep.  That was about it, right?  And there's so much more to life now, which is good, of course.  But sometimes I miss those halcyon days of youth.  Sometimes I miss the fact that a year felt like a year.  Now, it feels like no time at all.  I mean, I shouldn't be about to finish my third semester here at OU.  Hell, as far as my internal body clock is concerned, I really should still be at Ozarks.  Which just goes to show, I guess, that my biological clock needs to be wound.  I guess time only seems to move faster.  I've never read anything that says time really does go faster as you get older.  That'd be kind of weird.  Your grandparents aging faster than you do, so that they have two birthdays for each one of yours or something.  But I guess it makes sense that time feels like it's moving quicker as I get older.  I mean, each year is a smaller and smaller chunk of my total life.  When you're ten, a year is a big chunk of your total time on the planet.  Now, it's not even half as big a piece.  Soon, a year will just be a drop in the bucket.  Which means my life will be going "plunk" very gently.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Van Morrison, "Meaning of Loneliness"

       "If You Know The Words, Try To Sing Along"   The day didn't start out on a good note.  First, I overslept (by like thirty minutes), which meant I arrived at work late.  I hate being late.  It's as though I'm showing contempt and disdain for my job.  And even though there are times when my job annoys me to no end, I still rather like it, and don't hold it in contempt at all.  No, just some of the athletes, that's all.  But I got lucky, because my boss was not yet here, and she wouldn't have cared if I had been late.  C'est la vie (watch me butcher not one, but  two  languages!  Woo!).  Anyway, second annoying thing of the morning--my CD player wasn't working.  Turns out it just didn't like the CD I was trying to play, but it still frustrated me, because it was the CD I really wanted to listen to.  Blarg.  I eventually got it to play a different CD, so I won't be without music today, it just points out that my discman is getting old and decrepit (I've had it since like Senior year of high school.  I don't know that portable technology like that is supposed to last that long...especially if you accidentally drop the damn thing as much as I have).  Sadly, I won't have the funding to purchase a new one anytime soon.  And my left eye hurts, and I don't know why.  It feels like there's an eyelash or something in there, but there isn't.  No, it just hurts for no apparent reason.    So the morning didn't start out all that well.  I'm hoping that means it can only improve, but I know better than to expect that from life.  On the positive side, I had a good evening last night.  I went with Jessica to pick up Dominic from the airport, then we all went over to Beth's place to check out her Christmas tree and drink hot chocolate and just hang out.  We arrived there a little before 11:00pm, and left around 1:30am.  It was much fun, and much silliness and merriment was made.  I also went ahead and gave Beth her Christmas present--a CD for a band she's going to see in concert on Friday (Jars of Clay, if you must know).  She seemed genuinely excited about the present, so that's good.  And in fact, she's really seemed to warm up to me since this past Thursday.  I wonder just what sort of nefarious effect my family had on her.  Anyway, we also got to meet her friend Shane, a fellow Meterology major, who I think is probably afraid of me now because I was at my most hyperactive and manic last night (it was that or fall asleep, really).  He seems nice enough, though.  I think Beth, Jess, Dom, and myself are getting together next weekend (all four of us haven't gotten to do anything together since like the beginning of October, really...well, until last night) to celebrate Jess's birthday and her and Dom's anniversary.  They've been going out like six years now or something.  I know marriages that haven't lasted that long, so they have my congratulations.  Oh, random update--I figured out why my discman wouldn't play that CD earlier--I had the CD upside down, so that it was trying to read the label side.  In my defense, this particular CD looks the same on both sides, so it's an easy mistake to make.  Honest.  My damn eye still hurts, though.  I hope today doesn't continue yesterday's disturbing trend.  I don't want to look at another 40 page Business paper.  There's just something intrinsically wrong about reading 40 pages and knowing no more at the end of the paper than you did at the beginning.  Damn Business papers.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Jars of Clay, "Revolution"

       "And Still They Lead Me Back"   So I've been listening to the Beatles pretty much non-stop since Friday night.  Why?  I can't really explain (though I feel no need to explain  why  I'm listening to the Beatles--they just make good music.  It's pretty self-explanatory).  The trick is that I've only been wanting to listen to very specific albums and very specific versions of certain songs.  Lemme explain--the final Beatles album released,  Let It Be , has a song on it called "The Long and Winding Road."  This is actually one of the more contentious songs in the Beatles' catalogue.  Why?  Because of what Phil Spector, one of their producer/mixer guys did to it.  See, the original tune was recorded during the ill-fated Get Back/Let It Be sessions, which means it was supposed to be a very back-to-basics song.  Fair enough.  Piano, bass, guitar, drums, vocals.  Simple, right?  Well, then Phil Spector got hold of it during post-production, and made a mess of the whole thing by adding strings, horns, and a freakin' choir.  Spector managed to turn what was an emotional, honestly-delivered song with poignant lyrics and a beautiful melody into overly-sentimental clap-trap.  Which isn't to say the Spector version is  bad , per se; with the exception of Revolution #9, which is less a song and more a sonic collage of some sort (or whatever the hell you want to call that experimental crap Lennon did).  It's just that the un-Spectored version is far superior, yet was never released until the  Anthology  series came out back in 1995.  Thankfully,  Anthology 3  contains the un-altered original version of "The Long and Winding Road," and it's great.  Damn-near perfect, you could even say.  Anyway, the point of that rambling historical account was that I've been wanting to hear the original version of "The Long and Winding Road" ever since Friday, when I watched a Paul McCartney Live DVD I got for Christmas last year.  It's the companion piece to his  Back in the U.S.  double-disc live set (yes, this is the concert I didn't get to go to back in October 2002.  Yes, I'm still pissed).  It's got a version of "The Long and Winding Road" that he did on the last night of the tour and choked up because of his crew being all sentimental and stuff.  Very touching and affecting, but I wanted more than ever to hear the original version after that.  Well, I dug out  Anthology 3  and got my proverbial shwerve on.  But, as often happens with the Beatles (and many other groups I'm obsessed with), that one song was not enough.  I wanted more latter-day Beatles now.  So I started playing  Abbey Road  and  Let it Be  relentlessly, and gave the ol'  White Album  (aka  The Beatles ) a couple of spins over the weekend.  All of this adds up to two things:  (1) I'm really, really ready to hear the new  Let it Be...Naked  that was released a few weeks ago.  Sadly, I have to wait until Christmas, when dad or I one gets it.  (2) I'm in the mood to listen to early Harrision solo stuff.  Why?  "The Long and Winding Road" isn't a Harrison tune, it's a McCartney tune through and through.  Well, in the process of listening to  Anthology 3 , I heard a couple of Harrison's late Beatles tunes, and a couple of songs that wouldn't surface until George's solo debut,  All Things Must Pass .  So now I really want to listen to  All Things Must Pass .  This would be just fine, except that Clif swiped my copy of it (which I'd copied off of Dad's original CDs a couple of years ago, and habitually listened to like a crack addict going back for another hit day after day) the last time I was in Clarksville, and I forgot to grab Dad's while I was at home Thursday.  So I'm George-less, which is annoying as hell.  The moral of the story--I really need to get all the Beatles/solo Beatles stuff on CD for myself so I don't have to keep borrowing from Dad, and so Clif will stop stealing my copies.  As it stands, he stole all my copies of the Beatles albums (I still own a couple of the albums myself, and still miraculously have my old copies of  Let it Be  and  Magical Mystery Tour ) a couple of years ago.  Well, now that he has them, he can't steal them again, right?  Perfect time to get my own original copies.  Besides, I'll be heading off to another grad school soon.  Who knows exactly where that school will be.  All I know for sure is that it won't be close.  Long story short, I'll be too far away to borrow many of Dad's CDs anymore, and that's sad in a way.  It's always been nice to be able to dig through his collection when I'm at home; I won't be able to do that anymore if I'm going to school half a country (or across an ocean) away.  So, to recap--"The Long and Winding Road" is a good song, if you can find the un-adulterated version.  Latter-day Beatles work is really good, if you like the very precise production they used and can stand the rather meloncholy sense you get by listening to it and realizing they were falling apart at the seams as a band and that there's no chance of them ever making music again.  Now that everyone's thoroughly depressed (or at least, I am), I'm gonna go back to listening to  Anthology 3 .  "Glass Onion" is next.  Woo!  Oh, on a semi-related note, I got new headphones last night after work, so that crisis has been weathered.  Say what you will about the faceless corporate machine, 24-hour Wal-Marts are convenient.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Beatles, "Glass Onion"

       "A Pocket Full of Mumbles"   Well, I got all the stuff I need to make the Yeti CDs.  Ended up costing me over $45, so I hope there are enough people interested in these damn things to make it worth my while.  I've been listening to Bob Dylan's album  Desire  all day.  I like every song on there except "Joey," and I really just don't care for the pacing or story in it.  The rest of the album is great, and has a couple of his greatest story songs in it--"Hurricane," about Ruben Carter, and "Isis," a tale of love, graverobbing, and deceptive guys who steal your blanket.  It's also got "Sara," the song he wrote about his ex-wife telling her just exactly how much she'd meant to him.  Very moving song, really.  It's just such a wonderful album, and so full of energy and surreal images.  I borrowed the fifth Harry Potter book from Beth last night after we'd watched the  Sorcerer's Stone  DVD.  The Harry Potter books are a slight guilty pleasure, really.  As a historian, I have to spend so much of my time reading dusty, ponderous tomes of long-dead people.  It's nice to be able to relax once in a while with something a little less heavy, such as Harry Potter or a good Terry Pratchett novel.  Admittedly, the Harry Potter books get darker and darker, but they are still children's books, and as such have a sort of levity to them that is sorely lacking in books about the Great War (World War I, for those of you not from Europe) and the horrors of trench warfare and Russian ballet.  As the weekend draws nearer, I'm really beginning to anticipate my impending trip.  Monica emailed today and asked if I'd be willing to co-host the WA Press, acting as a sort of MC for the evening.  I told her I'd be delighted, because frankly, I would be.  I've really missed being involved in WA Press and Falstaff since I left Ozarks, and will gladly take this opportunity to expose new, fresh faces to its glory.  The only thing missing is my sibling.  If he were in the States right now, we could've done a Yeti show there, too.  Ah well.  I'll be hocking Yeti merch, so that's almost as good.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Simon and Garfunkel, "The Boxer"

       "The Best-Laid Plans"   Suddenly, the next few weeks are very planned-out, which is weird for me.  I barely plan what I'm going to do in the next ten minutes, let alone what I'm going to do weeks from now.  But such is the nature of things at this moment that I sorta have to know what's happening then, now, so I'm planning.  First thing's first--Ozarks this weekend.  I'm making that trip, hell or high water (though possibly not ice...driving in nasty ice stuff is no fun).  Before I can do that, though, I need to get my FAFSA finished (I get to fill it out as an independent this year--woo!  Wait, crap).  Also need to get an outline/plan of action for the thesis mapped out (mom's orders...God, I'm going to be independent, and I'm still jumping when my parents say so?  Eesh).  Easy enough.  The harder part--I have to get all the stuff together to make the Yeti CDs.  That requires finding it all, shelling out the necessary cash, and then figuring out the programs and stuff.  Then do it all.  But that'll be pretty fun, actually, and once I get it figured out, it'll be easy as hell, too.  From there, things get quiet for a week or so, then hectic again.  On the 7th of February, I'm apparently going to run in a race up in Ponca City, my place of birth and the residence of my maternal grandparents.  How I let dad keep talking me into these things, I'll never know.  On the other hand, I'm developing quite a nice collection of t-shirts from these things, and any extra shirt means one more day of not doing laundry.  The week after that is crazy.  On the 12th, I have a prospectus for my 20th Cenutry Europe paper.  Easy enough.  That's also the day that Wendy will be coming to Oklahoma, so from then until the 16th, I'm unavailable unless you're her.  Or work.  Stupid work.  Okay, maybe not unavailable.  But harder to reach, and probably a bit preoccupied.  Plus, I get to meet her new boy, Tim.  That should be fun.  For some reason, I it in my head that my friends' new significant others must meet some sort of standard set by me, or I won't allow them to date or something.  I dunno.  I like pretending that I need to approve of the guy, and that my opinion in the matter actually matters two bits.  After that, things get a bit hazy until the end of February, when I have a history conference.  I know I'll be working on the Master's Thesis during that time, and various other things (including work for my class), but the whens and whyfors and hows are all shrouded in what could be called "mystery."  And that's sorta how things will work for a while.  By Spring Break, I'm hoping to have the Master's Thesis finished, have heard from at least one college (and hopefully it'll be a positive message), and sorta have a game plan for the summer.   Whether or not that will happen...well, time will tell.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Bruce Springsteen, "Dancin' in the Dark"

       "You're Gonna Need A Quality Shoe"   So I bought a new pair of tennis shoes last night.  Why?  Well, my old shoes (old running shoes, actually) bit the dust last weekend when I helped Ev move.  It happened to be raining the entire time, and my shoes were pretty beat up as it stood (no pun intended), so I decided it was time for new kicks.  Easier said, of course, than done.  Went to Just for Feet first.  They were having a really good sale, and that's usually where I purchase my running shoes (past two pair from the one in Norman, actually).  Well, I find a pair I rather like, ask the guy to find my size in the back, and he can't.  Repeat this process two or three more times, and I'm starting to get frustrated.  So I head off for the mall, determined to try to find a pair of shoes that're comfortable and fit well and are within my price range.  The next store I visit is worthless.  Of the styles they had that I actually liked (which were very few), they never had my size, and they weren't within my price range.  I could tell my reluctance to spend less that $100 on a pair of shoes annoyed the salesman, but I'm a graduate student, and I don't see the point in wasting so much money on shoes.  They cover my feet.  As long as they're comfortable, look decent, and keep my feet dry/warm/unblistered, I'm happy.  So it's off for another store; this time Famous Footwear.  I amble about the store, just looking.  Here for once (in contrast to the previous two stores) were salespeople who were not so desperate to make a sale that they damn-near jumped me and started beating me over the head with name-brand shoes.  I found a pair I liked that fit and were within my price range.  The salesman was helpful, friendly, and not too aggressive.  I was happy with that, and now I have new shoes.  The whole thing about salesmen on commission is that they're more interested in selling you the most expensive pair of shoes they can than in making sure you the customer are happy.  Commission sales have always annoyed me.  It encourages people to be pushy and aggressive instead of laid back, and it makes the whole shopping experience unpleasant.  I have needs to attend to, and they don't include spending more on a pair of ugly shoes than I spend on groceries in a month.  I just wanted a decent pair of shoes.  Who gives a flying rodent's left earlobe if they were really expensive?  I sure don't.  I'd rather have the $30 or $40 pair than the $100 pair.  I just can't justify spending more than about $40 on shoes, unless they're running shoes.  And that's different--as heavy as I am, I need shoes with really good cushioned support or I won't have any knees by the time I'm 25 (only a little over a year away, now...Lord, I'm getting old).  Anyway, yeah, I have new shoes now.  Which is nice.  The others can be retired...well, after next weekend, when I wear them while helping Miss Erisman move.  All I can say is that no one better be moving again until at least May.  Of course, then I'll be moving, and Beth, and...  Argh.  Too much moving.  When I rule the world, I'm decreeing that people cannot move around anymore.  You're tied to your locality.  It'll be like the Middle Ages again, when everyone is tied to the land and no one can go anywhere.  It'll be perfect.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Mark Knopfler, "Quality Shoe"

       "A Generation Lost In Space"   So I keep hearing about Bush's new space program or whatever you want to call it.  Send folks back to the moon.  Build a colony up there.  Then--Mars.  It's as though he were pulling his policy from 1950s serialized sci-fi comics.  I remember a few years ago, I was listening to a professor in our Sci-Fi/Fantasy class talk about the possibility of having a moon colony or whatnot.  I'd wondered about it myself--having read some of the old 1950s and '60s childrens' books that figured we'd all be living on the moon by this time, I wondered why you never heard anything about the possibility after about, oh, say Apollo 11.  The professor basically just told me that it was a pipedream and that no one seriously thought we were going to do that sort of thing anymore.  Either I was lied to, or no one told Bush this.  It all does seem rather fanciful, though.  Almost laughable, even.  I have to wonder--we have enough trouble getting things right here on Earth.  Do we really want to go to someplace more cramped, more dangerous, and more likely to go *ka-BOOOM!* if we screw something up?  Not to mention all the freakin' money it would cost?  Money that could be spent better elsewhere, say, providing better educational funding.  Or figuring out a way to get along with everyone (here's a hint--stop starting wars with everyone who looks at us crosseyed!  Especially if they're yetis).  But ultimately, I don't think anyone's going to go along with the idea, especially Congress.  When we can't even keep a robot on Mars from getting cut off from us, do we want to chance it with people?  Unless, of course, they let me pick the people we send.  In which case, I'd be very happy to chance it.  Maybe even stack the chances in favor of Mars.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Moxy Fruvous, "You Will go to the Moon"

       "Of Yetis and Visitations"   I'm trying to sound out opinions on something--I'm thinking of getting the necessary supplies to create Cross-Eyed Yeti albums.  We're talking CD labels, jewel cases, case inserts, the whole shebang.  If there's enough interest in it (i.e., enough people are willing to pay me $5 to listen to me "sing" and to Clyde play the guitar), I'll do it, and probably sell them at WA Press next week and then to anyone who wants one.  Which reminds me--it appears I'm going to be able to make a trip to Ozarks next weekend.  This is very good news indeed--I haven't gotten to see them in a few months, and I don't get to make nearly as many visits there as I'd like.  As it stands, several of my friends from there are graduated now, and the number of people I can visit dwindles with each passing semester.  Soon, there will be only one or two people there worth visiting.  As it stands, I probably won't be able to visit much after this semester, since God only knows where I'll be (for my education and future's sake, hopefully not Oklahoma).  It just keeps reminding me how fast time has gone by, I guess.  This time last year, I was still making monthly trips to Ozarks.  Chris and JP and James were still there.  Heather was still there.  The majority of the people I cared about most in the world were contained in a single Arkansan town, and I could visit them all with ease.  Now, of course, Chris and JP are in Seattle, James is in Fayetteville, Heather's in El Dorado, and I can't visit everyone at once.  I know I seem to harp on this subject a lot, but my life's in something of a transition right now.  I don't feel like I've been in Norman long enough for it to be "home," though I noticed I've started referring to the apartment as that.  Ozarks can't really be home anymore, nor can my parents' place.  I really don't have anyplace to think of as where I belong.  I've tried to belong here in Norman, and sometimes I feel I do.  When I'm hanging out with Jess and Dom, or Beth, or Ev, it feels comfortable, as though that's where I'm supposed to be.  But then any other time of the day, or the week or month or whatever...Norman just feels like a place where I'm letting the engine idle, a limbo where I don't really belong.  I guess it's because a part of me is always thinking, "I'm not here for much longer, so there's no reason to get attached to the place."  Also, it seems like no place can ever feel as home-like as Ozarks did.  I know it has less to do with Clarksville or even the school (though I always liked the school...I know several other alumni and alumnae and even current students don't think too highly of the place, but I think I got a very high-quality education there, and feel that I was treated pretty fairly for the most part and that I was only screwed around by the administration a reasonably few number of times).  The reason it felt like home was the people.  And it's not that I don't care for my friends here--on the contrary, I care for them very deeply.  I feel that I can talk to Ev about anything, and that I always have a place to go with Jess and Dom, and that Beth is always ready and willing to just hang out and be one of the most  fun  people I've been around in a long time.  Those four people mean very much to me, and I wouldn't trade them for the world.  But let's face it--I had more time to get closer to the Ozarks crew, and was in a different situation there.  I lived in close proximity with them.  Here, everyone is so spread out and running around keeping up with their hectic lives.  It's become that way with the Ozarks crew, too, but I still had a good two or three or even four years of living amongst a group of people that I came to think of as my brothers and my sisters, and I miss them very much.  I've often said that family are people you sorta have to love.  You're basically obligated.  You don't get to choose them; you're stuck with the folks fate picked for you from before you were born.  But friends...friends are those you love because you  want  to, because you  chose  them.  So in a way, the bond you form with your friends is much stronger than the bond you'll form with your family.  That's why I hate letting go of any friend.  That's why being so far from so many of them is difficult for me.  And not just the Ozarks crew--I miss them, to be sure, but I miss Wendy, I miss a couple of others from high school, I miss people I knew years ago whom I haven't seen since I was in short pants, as the cliche goes.  I don't know why some nights seem to be harder to bear than others, they just are.  I don't know what triggers these bouts of nostalgia and longing, they just sorta...happen sometimes.  I don't think it's because I'm a manic-depressive or anything like that.  I just feel...wistful tonight.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Coldplay, "Clocks"

       "Kupo, Bi-atch"   I've been playing more Final Fantasy Tactics Advance than is probably healthy.  It's one of those games where I sit there and think, "Hey, I don't have to leave for class for ten minutes.  That's enough time for a battle."  I'm not playing at  urlLink stoplights  or anything, but it seems that anytime I've got a few minutes available, I'm firing up the ol' GBA and getting in a quick round.  I've logged nearly 40 hours on the game, and really have no idea how far along I am.  I've unlocked lots of new jobs, though I haven't gotten around to trying them all out, and I'm still not sure how to use a couple of them (such as blue magic).  It's just such an engrossing game, and I'm just such a geek.  There ought to be some sort of medicine or something I can take for this.  I'm probably going to have to play through it again after I beat it, because I haven't even really used one of the races, which means I haven't been able to unlock their race-specific jobs or anything like that.  It's really almost too late in the game to start now.  I'd never be able to get them to a high enough level or to learn their stuff fast enough to catch up with the half dozen or so characters I've been using constantly.  And I've got a pretty powerful, well-rounded group.  I've got magic users, and swordsmen (and women), and an archer or two.  And I have a moogle.  The moogle rocks, because they just do, y'know?  Anyway, time that could be better spent (doing, say, research or reading for class or something of that nature) has been devoted to this obsession.  We have my siblings to blame, really, since they got it for me for Christmas.  So yeah, kupo.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Wallflowers, "Too Late to Quit"

       "The Three Men I Admire Most--The Father, Son, And Holy Ghost"   I often wonder how people perceive my spirituality, if they do at all.  Do I come across as a religious or spiritual person?  Or maybe as agnostic or atheist, even?  It's a question that bothers me from time to time, and one that I've been thinking about today.  Years ago, I had someone tell me that they were surprised to find out I was Christian, because I didn't act like it.  This was coming from someone who is a pagan, so I don't know if that comment was a complement or not, but it still bothered me.  Do I actually come across as atheist?  I am most definitely not, though I may be riddled and plagued with doubt and concerns.  I like to think that I'm a very spiritual person.  Perhaps not as enamoured of organized religion as I once was, but I blame education for that fact.  In fact, I think it's safe to say that the way I think about religion, spirituality, and God are all shaped by the fact that I've had what you might call an excess of education in certain areas.  I have been trained to think critically about things, to question and pick things apart until I understand what people think and why they think them.  In the process, some of what people believe inevitably comes across as superstition or ludicrous, outdated modes of thinking that simply cannot work in today's world.  But I still think that, at the core of my being, I am a spiritual person.  I believe in God, though I know not the nature of that Being.  I try to be reverent, though I know I'm often not.  But I still wonder how I'm perceived.  I'll admit, oftentimes I get wrapped up in concerns that are entirely of this world.  Sometimes I'm too materialistic, sometimes I'm too worried about stuff and whether or not I have  things .  I let stuff that's ultimately meaningless and empty dictate my life sometimes, and I let stupidity and prejudice enter my mind and control my actions.  I sin, I don't try to tell others about any sort of message, and I'm sometimes an exceptionally mean person.  On the other hand, I also still like to think that I lead a good, Christian life, or at least try to.  I've taken the message--the Golden Rule ("do unto others," not "he who has the gold makes the rules"), the Good Samaritan, loving my neighbor--and I've engrained them into my very being, made them a part of me.  Anything that is within my power to help someone, I try to do.  I try to lead a good life, to be the person I know I'm supposed to be.  If I sometimes fail--which I know I do, because I'm a fallible, frail person--I try to make amends, I try to move beyond it and do better the next time.  I like to think that, deep in my heart, I've accepted Christ, and that I'm who He'd want me to be.  But am I?  Ultimately, what other people think about me is unimportant.  Yet it still bothers me that people might perceive me as something I'm not.  But maybe all this concern is unimportant.  Maybe I've made my point many times.  I mean, look at the comics I do--Crooked Halo, which deals with the issues of trusting God, dealing with doubt, and overcoming temptation (or Tim Tation, as the case may be); and Troubled Times, which deals with much the same issues in a more serious and action-packed sort of way.  The former is somewhat irreverent, the latter is less so, but they keep going back to a single fact--I start from the assumption that there is a God, that He or She or It is a Loving Being who created everything, and that life has a purpose.  Trials have a purpose.  Good things happen for a reason, and so do bad.  Perhaps the reason a bad thing happens is to teach us a lesson, or to show us how good we had it.  Maybe good things happen as a reward, or as a way of saying, "hey, chin up, you can make it."  I think God speaks to me, to something deep inside of me that I can't articulate in thoughts or words, but I can almost feel a tangible presence sometimes.  A couple of years ago, when I was in Yellowstone, I was sitting outside one evening watching the sun set.  This was just after a rather emotionally draining year at Ozarks, one which left me on the verge of mental and physical breakdown.  Had school lasted even another week, I don't think I'd have made it.  I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't eating well, I was sitting awake at night just thinking about things that only depressed me.  But then Clif and I went to Yellowstone.  The separation from my friends hurt; hurt probably more than anything I've ever experienced in my life.  But it also separated me from the anxieties I'd faced at school and at home.  It forced me to come face to face with who I was and where I was in my life.  So anyway, I was sitting there watching the sunset.  And it was beautiful.  I really can't do it justice, because I'm decent with words, but not that good.  It was just something about the mountains, and the stars coming out one by one, and the air slowly cooling and giving up the heat of the day...I just started to smile, and to feel all the tension and fear and anxiety drain out of me.  For a few minutes, I had no worries, no stress, nothing but me and the sunset.  And I was at peace; total, complete peace.  And I think in that moment, I truly understood who I was, and I felt God's presence.  Maybe that sounds a little hokey, but then again, I don't really care what you think about it.  It was my moment, my connection to the Divine, and I'll never forget it.  Since then, anxieties have returned, doubt has crept back in as it always does, and my life is full of stress and uncertainties.  But I can handle them now.  I can deal with the stress and doubt, I can deal with being hundreds of miles away from the majority of the people I care about more than life itself.  I will survive, because I know that there is a God out there watching over me.  And that is very comforting.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Newsboys, "Shine"

       "Can Music Save Your Mortal Soul?"   Well, the past two nights, I have stayed up until about 6.00 am.  Which is all well and good, because I'm spending most of that time with people (specifically, Beth), but still...that's really throwing off my sleep pattern.  Actually, last night wouldn't have been so late if it weren't for the  urlLink comic .  We left Jess and Dom's place around 4.00 am, and I dropped Beth off at her place and came back here.  I was getting ready to go to bed, and remembered I hadn't done a comic for today yet.  So I stayed awake and did a comic.  I finally got it all uploaded and the site updated by 6.00 am.  So I hope everyone appreciates the comic.  That's right--I go the extra mile for my readers, because I have made a commitment to provide them with consistant entertainment.  I'm actually halfway pleased with the way it turned out, especially since it was so damn early when I was drawing it.  Anyway, last night was fun.  We all sat and played Lord of the Rings Risk, which is apparently a little bit different from regular Risk.  You get these Adventure cards which you can use to get extra battilions or destroy some of your opponent's battillions or gain or eliminate an advantage.  It was guys against girls, and going rather poorly for the boys until the very end, when I went on a run and took like ten or eleven territories, three or four strongholds, and basically won the game (by two points...very, very close).  The game was actually interesting and entertaining enough to keep me playing even when we were losing so badly.  And hey, it paid off--I consolidated the forces of darkness in Mordor and Haradwaith (in the southernmost part of Middle Earth), and then pushed up and out.  I drove the forces of good before me, and smote them mightily upon my sword.  And yea, it was fun.  And lucky--Beth could roll nothing but 5 and 6 until the very end, when I went on my rampage, and Jess had like 25 territories before my run.  The forces of darkness were getting their asses kicked for most of the game, that's for sure.  This extended weekend's really going to throw me off tomorrow when I have to return to class and work.  I've done literally nothing school related since Thursday.  Four days of just kickin' back and relaxing...well, not totally, since I went home Friday and helped Ev move Saturday.  But maxin' and relaxin' besides that.  Ah well--I almost don't know what to do with all the extra time anyway, so this is probably for the best.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Don McLean, "American Pie"

       "Movin' On Up"   So yesterday I helped Ev move into a new apartment.  He's now two buildings over from me, right across the parking lot basically.  Which is cool, because now I can annoy the hell out of my coworker at will.  But the man has a lot of stuff.  It's mostly books and papers and God knows what else, but there's a lot of it.  The fact that we were able to get it all moved to the new apartment in about 8 hours total is pretty damn impressive...especially considering that his last move (back over the summer) took place over a few days and had more people helping.  I chalk most of it up to the fact that he hadn't unpacked most of his stuff from that move still, and the fact that he got virutally everything else boxed up before we started the move.  Having things already boxed should not be taken lightly--that single aspect saved us countless hours, I'm sure, because we spent most of the time during the previous move boxing up all the loose stuff he has.  Granted, the fact that he got rid of like 12 boxes worth of crap between moves really helped, too.  All told, my arms and legs are a bit sore today from all the lifting (amusingly enough, I'm one of his stronger friends...which tells you quite a bit about the people he usually hangs out with).  I'm not hurt to the point of immobility, mind, just kinda sore.  Anyway, I basically spent all afternoon and part of the early evening helping Ev move.  Then I went and hung out with Beth for like eight or nine hours.  We watched the two Toy Story movies (which I hadn't seen since my last trip to Virginia...and that was back in August of 2002, right after I got back from Yellowstone).  I'd forgotten just how funny those movies are, and how well-done they are.  You could see the improvement from the first one to the second one.  It was almost startling.  I'd never watched them back to back like that, and though the first one is amazingly well done, it's nothing compared to the second in terms of the art and the images.  They're both very funny and warm movies, and I really wish I could find them on DVD myself.  Anyway, after our little mini movie marathon, we channel surfed for a while (digital cable's pretty damn cool, says the man who doesn't even have basic cable and never really watches TV).  Ended up watching a downright ancient episode of Saturday Night Live (had Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd doing the Coneheads, and Andy Kauffman), then flipping through random channels until we found this old '70s movie called  Image of the Beast .  Think of the  Left Behind  books and movies.  Now imagine they were made in the '70s, only without any sort of decent acting or special effects or script or anything like that.  It was really, really bad, but in that trainwreck sort of way that kept drawing you in to it, to the point that you couldn't understand why you were fascinated with it, but just had to keep watching.  I think Beth was finally able to turn it off simply because leaving it on meant we kept laughing at how straight-faced all the actors were while they delivered some of the campiest lines I've ever heard.  I felt almost bad for laughing at it, given the subject matter.  I mean, it dealt with matters of prophecy and the end times and the like, and while this can be done well (this was not such an instance, but I know it  can  be done well), you feel bad about laughing at it when it's done badly.  Almost like you're laughing at Jesus, I dunno.  Though I've probably already earned myself a personal spot in the lowest bowels of hell for other things (unless God has a really understanding sense of humor...it's my only hope, really), so I guess laughing at this absolutely atrocious movie wasn't going to do me much harm.  My main issue with it, though, was trying to figure out who the movie would appeal to.  My main guess was folks who already believed in the ideas and values the movie espoused.  In which case, there was really no reason for the silly thing to be made.  It probably wasn't likely to make many converts--those who would be tempted to believe what the movie talked about and proported wouldn't likely feel that the movie itself did a good job of presenting its case.  Those who wouldn't be convinced wouldn't see the movie anyway.  It all just seemed so...pointless.  But it was amusing at 3.00 am, I'll give it that.  And considering we stayed up for a good two and a half hours more after that, I'd say we were at least entertained by everything.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Sheryl Crow, "Leaving Las Vegas"

        Only Human on the Inside    First off, congrats on the fan mail! Print it out, frame it, and hang it with a pretty bow. (Ok, maybe not so much the bow, but... Congrats, nonetheless).  Never can tell, you may eventually start getting so many fan mails that you have to open a new account for it all. (Hmm.. maybe the bow would be a good idea, after all.. pretty bows...)  Now... There is absolutely no reason for you to believe you're a failure as a human being. We  all  make assumptions and mistakes, and often the two go hand in hand. It's really not your fault that you've assumed these things. You wouldn't have assumed anything, if someone hadn't said, or done, something to make you believe it. You know as well as I do that some people (myself included, a lot of the time) have a habit of ranting and raving when something goes wrong and not saying very much, at all, about the good, when it finally happens. Like so much in this life, the good is taken for granted, and yes, it's wrong and should be remedied (still working on it, on my part).  There's not as much of a drive to let everyone know when everything seems to be going decently as there is when there's something or someone about whom we want to complain. That's part of why it's called "venting," I think.  You, my friend, are one of the truest, most giving, caring individuals that I have ever had the priviledge of calling a friend. Even when you've had a bad day or are not feeling well, you still put your friends first and try to make sure that they're ok. (Just make sure you put yourself first every now and then, too. K?) You are in no way, shape, or form a failure as a human being. And anyone who says so is going to find themselves with a few bricks upside their respective heads.   So, having said that, I'm off to send imitation fan mail to myself (better than imitation bacon bits, y'know).    Slan

       "The Man's Too Strong"   There's something to be said for whining about something in an open, public venue where anyone can wander in, see what you've whined about, and perhaps do something about it if they are so inclined.  See, over at  urlLink Dim Bulb  today, I mentioned that we've never received any fanmail from people we don't know (at least, I never have.  Can't really speak for Adam).  This amused me, as the comic for Friday was all about the cliched webcomic convention of having a "mailbag day" when the artist can't come up with anything else (it wasn't that I couldn't come up with anything else--rather, I just wanted to make fun of the fact that many comic artists have this problem, it seems).  Anyway, my rant mentioned we'd never received any reader mail from people we didn't know.  My desire to have feedback is probably well known by anyone who happens to be reading this.  I almost crave it, you could say, like an addict craves heating up the ol' spoon for that hit of heroin.  I've mentioned before that all I really want is to receive an email or something from a complete stranger saying something to the effect of, "hey, read your comic, really liked it, keep up the good work."  So guess what was in my inbox today when I woke up?  No, I mean aside from spam offering to enlarge my penis.  That's right--an email from a complete stranger saying they liked my comic.  I wouldn't have believed it was real except that they'd put "Crooked Halo" in the subject line.  And they didn't offer to sell me anything, or ask me to help a deposed Nigerian princess.  It wasn't anything fancy or spectacular.  This person didn't praise my names to the Heavens in some sort of elaborate hossanah.  They just simply said they liked my comic and my art style.  And that was enough for me.  So I've rather been walking on clouds or sunshine or whatever all afternoon (clouds, probably--it's been cloudy and rainy, so I doubt there's been much sunshine to walk on).  I'm sure this single, simple email will be the start of something--by which I mean I'll probably start wanting more and more.  Soon, that one little email won't be enough.  I'll want well-known people to email me and say they like my stuff, like the guys from Penny Arcade or Mac Hallor 8-Bit Theatre or something.  But we'll take it one step at a time, I think.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Bob Dylan, "Desolation Row"

       "It's Just Enough To Be Strong In The Broken Places"   Despite my every effort to the contrary, I am a failure as a human being.  I am, without a doubt, exceptionally flawed and fallible.  Admittedly, so is every single other person in the world.  Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying...or trying to sell you something.  But when I say I'm a failure as a human being, what I mean is this--I screw up.  A lot.  And not just about stupid little things, or even just things that only effect me.  I screw up about things involving other people.  I misinterpret what I'm told.  I jump to (often wrong) conclusions.  I commit that most grievous of errors--I  assume .  The latter I've noticed in a couple of very obvious lessons of late involving two individuals.  The first was when I assumed an acquaintance of mine--not even someone I really knew all that well--was atheist, or at least agnostic at best.  And I was completely, totally wrong.  I like to pride myself on being a good judge of character and of personality, and I had this girl pegged so completely wrong, it's sad.  I just assumed, based on the few things I thought I knew about her, that she wasn't a Christian.  It was a terrible thing for me to do, and though I've apologized and she's told me it's not a big deal, it still sorta eats away at my mind.  The second instance dealt with a friend of mine's mother.  Everything I'd heard about her mother seemed to be negative.  My friend had told me on multiple occasions just how much her mother frustrated her, and how she felt herself becoming more like her mother and how that bothered her.  Then in a conversation this past evening, it was completely different--she had nothing but amazing graces on her lips for her mother (and, given the situation, rightly so.  The girl's mother went above and beyond the call of even familial duty and obligation in a way that endears this woman I've never met to my heart).  I pointed out what seemed to me to be a discrepency--all I'd ever heard was of the negative aspects of my friend's relationship with her mother.  But no, come to find out I was mistaken about this as well--her mother was not the heartless harpy I'd envisioned, and for the second time in less than a month, I'd made the mistake of assuming something quite inaccurate and unwarranted.  I felt a bit stupid, really.  The second situation reminded me of something that happened a couple of years ago, in a situation rather similiar though with different players.  My friend Heather had the habit of telling us whatever was bothering her about her boyfriend.  He was, admittedly, rather inattentive at the time (this has since changed, for which I am very thankful).  After a particularly upsetting rant, I asked Heather why she was still with the guy.  "All we ever hear is how miserable he makes you," I said, speaking for the group (arrogance, folly!).  "If he makes you that miserable, why the hell are you still with him?"  Heather looked at me blankly for a moment, then laughed a bit.  "Honey, I only tell you the bad things.  I don't tell you the good things, because you guys would get sick and tired of hearing about that.  He's not that bad, actually."  And he's not, really.  Heather has presented a more balanced impression of her fiancee since then, and things are fine.  But it all gets me wondering--how many things do I make ridiculous assumptions about without any sort of basis in complete fact?  I know that, despite whatever empirical evidence I may have gathered about someone or something, there is always more I do not know.  There is always the fact that I'm often basing my opinions and impressions on half-formed, vague ideas and someone else's words.  As a historian, I wouldn't rely on someone else to tell me what a primary source says.  So why do I do that with people?  A question to ponder, to be sure.  I am glad to say, however, that my stupid assumptions have not yet caused any serious problems with my friends.  I've done stupid things, they've done stupid things, and we all laugh, forgive, and foget.  We grow as people, we learn.  Every day, in every way, we are getting better and better.  Or at least assuming that we get better.  And let's not forget what happens when we make an assumption.  It's cliche, but oh-so true.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Jars of Clay, "Lesser Things"

       "Birds Without Wings"   I mediated a fight between friends this evening over Messenger.  It wasn't something I particularly wanted to do, and I'm not even sure they wanted me to do it, but I did it, and in hindsight do not regret my decision to step in.  At the time, I had my doubts, because I felt I was being dragged into something which was not my concern.  Then I remembered that anything that happens to my friends is of concern to me, and I felt an internal obligation to do what I could.  I'm not sure how much of their reconciliation can be attributed to my intervention, and how much of it was just the two of them coming to terms with one another, but a part of me likes to think I had some sort of positive effect on the preceedings.  I often wonder why I do things like that, though.  It's fairly common--I always let myself get caught up in the middle of things that really shouldn't concern me, things that are not going to directly affect me in any way, shape, or form.  I try to get friends to reconcile.  It just seems...right, I guess, as if that's how things should be.  Until I got into college, really, I didn't have very many friends.  I had a few in high school, and fewer in elementary and junior high, but in college I suddenly found myself surrounded by people who knew me and loved me anyway.  It was a good feeling, and I count myself very lucky to have as many close friends as I do.  And their number grows still, for which I am eternally grateful.  But I still can't let go of the idea of letting friends go, if you will.  A part of me still remembers what it was like being laughed at by everyone at school, and what it was like to always eat lunch alone, play alone at recess, and be made fun of by everyone around me.  Part of me still remembers what it's like not having friends.  There's a quote I recall, though I cannot remember who it is by.  It goes something to the effect of "he who has a hundred friends has not one to spare."  I think there's some truth to that.  I don't have anywhere near that many close friends.  There are maybe a dozen to two dozen scattered across the country whom I'd consider close friends, people whom I'd trust with my life.  As I look at that statement, put down in writing, it occurs to me just how amazing that is.  Nearly two dozen people that I'd trust that much, and that I love more than I could ever express.  There are really no adequate words for it.  Most people count themselves lucky to find one such person in a lifetime, and I've found over 20 in but a couple of decades.  I think that makes me one of the luckiest, wealthiest men alive.  The funny thing is, despite having so many, I refuse to let even one go.  I don't like letting go of friends, ever.  Even if there's been a serious falling out, I refuse to believe that they could no longer be my friend.  I cling on long after I should.  It actually reminds me of a passage from Terry Pratchett's  Small Gods .  The small god Om was reminiscing about his first believer, a shepherd out searching for a lost sheep.  The shepherd, Om remembered, had hundreds of sheep, yet would search for a single lost lamb.  In fact, the reason the shepherd  had  hundreds of sheep was that he was willing to search for days for a single lost one.  I'm not saying I'm a shepherd to my friends or anything, but I think part of the reason I've been blessed with such an abundance of close friends is that I refuse to give up even on one.  When I become someone's friend, they do not get rid of me easily.  By the same token, I don't like to see other people lose friends, either.  It's very hard for me to understand a parting of ways that is total and permanent.  I can't comprehend why people would want to do that.  If you love someone dearly, why would you no longer want to be their friend or have anything to do with them?  How can you suddenly hate them as well?  It's an idea alien to me.  In fact, I've only felt it twice, and both times it was in high school, and dealt with a pair of people in whom I had placed trust (and another friend had as well) and that trust was broken in a complete and irreconcilable fashion.  Those two people destroyed years of friendship for making out, essentially, and nearly destroyed a dear friend of mine in the process.  It was petty, and stupid, and selfish, and I hated them for a long time for it.  I don't anymore (rather, I pity them now), but at the time...I wanted nothing to do with them.  But I am still hesitant to ever let the sun go down on my anger with a friend.  I've gotten mad at friends many times before.  They or I often do something stupid and selfish that sparks a fire inside of me that flares up and consumes me.  I've stormed off with rage burning in my heart many times, leaving friends slackjawed behind me.  But I always come back and try to repair the breach.  Conflicts are, of course, a part of any relationship, romantic or Platonic or otherwise.  Conflict is part of the dynamic and allows us to grow as people.  Without it, we'd become stagnant and disconnected from other people and from ourselves.  While I'm not glad I've had to fight with my friends, I am always glad that we've worked through our difficulties and come out even stronger than before.  I love all of my friends dearly, and consider myself luckier than I could ever express in words to have them.  I wouldn't trade even the most difficult and trying moment with a friend for anything else in the world.  Maybe I'm just a sentimental sap, but then again, maybe that's not so bad.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Jars of Clay, "Trouble Is"

       "It's Four O'Clock In The Morning, Or Maybe It's Five"   It's 4.00 am, and I'm awake for no reason I can identify.  I'm simply...not asleep.  I think it's due in large part to worrying.  Not about myself, or anything directly connected to me, except insofar as anything that happens to those I care about is connected to me.  Truth be told, my mind is nowhere near Norman, OK right now.  It's probably cast itself adrift and ended up in Clarksville, as it is wont to do.  So basically I'm really worried about a pair of my Clarksville friends, and for completely different reasons.  In either case, I wish there was something I could do to help them.  Something other than sit here and listen to them, I mean.  Yeah, I'm glad I'm able to act as a confidant, and I'm sure it helps them some, but...it doesn't really solve either of their problems.  I don't know when I got it in my head that I have to try to solve everyone's problems.  The cop-out answer is, of course, that I'm a guy, and guys feel the intrinsic need to fix things.  But it's more than that.  I've never noticed my father try to do this, or my siblings, or any of the other guys I know.  It seems...well, not exactly unique to me, but something decidedly unusual, regardless of gender.  When did I get my own life so figured out that I could run around solving everyone else's problems?  What am I, the personification of the United States; trying to get everyone else straightened out and playing fair while my own affairs go down the proverbial toilet?  Admittedly, my own affairs seems fairly straight-forward for once; there is nothing going on in my life that I cannot really handle or cope with.  Sure, I've got my usual low-level existential doubt and vague worries that have no name, shape, or face, but those are normal.  I'm used to all that.  But it still really bothers me that I can't do more.  I think the crux of the problem is this--I'm too damn far away.  If I were actually in Clarksville, there'd be a little more I could do.  I could comfort a little easier, perhaps, or in a more immediate manner.  But's not possible from Norman, not in the way I feel it should be.  So I get to sit here and stew over the fact that I keep feeling there is more I could or should be doing, and knowing that I can't do anymore than I currently am doing for them.  And that's why I'm still awake at 4.00 am on a Wednesday morning.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Charlie Daniels Band, "Devil went down to Georgia" (hey, it's on the radio, leave me alone)

       "Your Affectionate Uncle, Screwtape"   I've been reading C. S. Lewis's  Screwtape Letters  the past week or so.  It's a very interesting little collection of fictitious letters written by a senior demon to his nephew, a young temptor named Wormwood.  I know reading this sort of thing probably makes me come across as pretentious and more intellectual than I am (especially since I also tend to enjoy the not-so-finer things in life as well, such as beer and pizza and Street Fighter II...the game, not the atrocious movie).  But I've been a big fan of C. S. Lewis for years now, ever since I first read the  Chronicles of Narnia  in like elementary or junior high.  Lewis has this way of mixing his religious message with wit, intelligence, insight, style, and a dash of humor that makes his work irresistable...at least, to me, anyway.  It's also interesting to see how this work played a part in two other important works, though they are works of a vastly different nature.  The first is Bill Watterson's Calvin and Hobbes, the second is the novel  Good Omens , by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman.  In the former, Watterson used the name Wormwood for Calvin's teacher.  I think I actually pinpointing the passage in the  Screwtape Letters  that inspired this.  It's in the first "letter," and reads: "From the way some of you young fiends talk, anyone would suppose it was our job to  teach! "  I think I laughed for a good five minutes when I read that.  As far as Lewis' influence on  Good Omens , that's a bit more subtle.  In the novel, Pratchett and Gaiman developed a character named Crowley, a demon on earth whose job it was to get as many people damned to hell as possible.  Crowley went about this in rather unorthodox ways, such as designing a highway around London that, when viewed from above, made the shape of an unholy symbol of evil and power, the name of which escapes me at the moment.  It was designed to channel the low-level anger, hate, and aggression that people felt on a daily basis about travelling on that stretch of road into a sort of spiritual funnel, and really add a slight dark tinge, a tarnish to thousands and thousands of souls per day.  Crowley thought in terms of quantity, really--he was doing his job, not because he hated mankind, and not because he particularly wanted to damn thousands to hell, but because he was supposed to.  He was something of a craftsman, and took pride in doing his job well, mind--it's just that really he rather liked humans.  On the other hand, he had to deal with two other demons, Hastur and Ligur, who are more of what Crowley thinks of as the old-school demons.  They take a more qualitative approach to temptation and damnation.  They work and weddle at a single soul for an entire lifetime, really working on that one person until that individual is finally damned.  They are demons of the Screwtape variety, actually--they go after their targets one at a time, relishing that personal touch.  Anyway, that's the extent of excitement here, except that I'm still trying to get enrolled.  My professor needs to set my class approval at four hours instead of three so that I can be enrolled full time.  Eight hours doesn't cut it; I need that one extra hour, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to be doing enough extra work to earn that extra hour anyway.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Jackson Browne, "Late for the Sky"

       "Put The Load Right On Me"   I end up listening to my friends' problems a lot.  I have that sort of face (figuratively speaking--a lot of times, it's via the internet or phone or some other electronic media) that folks feel comfortable talking to, maybe.  I like to think I'm just a comfortable person, that people feel at ease around me, and that they can trust me.  And for the most part, I think a lot of people think that, and I like to think it's warranted.  I've noticed something almost amusing lately.  Well, not exactly amusing, because the stuff being discussed usually isn't funny (unless it's happening to someone you don't like, in which case it's funnier than hell...but this is stuff happening to people I care deeply about, so it's not so funny).  But I've noticed that a few of the people who usually discuss their problems with me have been hesitant to do so.  When I asked them why, the answer was actually the same--they felt they were "overburdening" me.  I would have laughed if it weren't for the fact that they genuinely believed they were being too much of a burden on me.  This is something I really don't get.  I mean, it's not that I'm unaffected by their woes.  I am.  I'm not so callow as to just listen and let it all roll off my back like water off a duck.  It's just that I feel almost like I have...not a duty or obligation to listen, but almost a responsibility.  It was drummed into my head at a very young age that anything I could do for people, I should do.  Especially for friends--anything that it is within my power to do, I'll do, whatever the personal cost may be.  If listening to a friend's problems helps them in some way, I'll do it.  I may have my own problems, and they may be difficult for me to deal with, but that doesn't mean I should be oblivious to the problems of my friends.  Besides, if I can make someone I care for's life easier, shouldn't I do it?  Besides, enough people over the past several years have listened to my problems without complaint, it's only right that I return the favor, even if it's to different people.  It's like paying it forward, I guess, and what goes around comes around.  Karma is very real, people--what you do now will have an effect on what comes after, and your reaction to the current situation will shape how life works on down the road.  People have helped me.  I quite possibly wouldn't be here if not for some of the very, very close friends I've had over the previous five or six years.  They know who they are--the ones who let me cry on their shoulders, who let me bitch and complain and moan about whatever petty thing was bothering me at that time, who held me and told me it'd be okay.  Those are the people I dedicate myself to, and my efforts to help my friends in turn.  I'm repaying their kindness in the way that would, I think, best please them.  I'm always here for my friends, regardless of the time or the day.  It's not a burden to me--it's a privilege.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Elliot Smith, "Between the Bars"

       "Flagpole Sitta"   Well, remember all the complaining I've been doing of late about how lonely I am?  That's all ended, it seems.  Friday night, I hung out with Everett for like six or seven hours, watching disc three of Blue Seed (only one more and Blue Seed Beyond left!) and just chatted.  Then Saturday evening was spent picking Beth up from the airport, having a quick bite of dinner with her, and then both of us joining Jess and Dom for a game of bowling (I totally 0w|\|z0r3d...or something like that).  A wonderful evening, yes indeed.  And tomorrow is spent with folks from both the school paper and work at meetings for each.  Oh, and for information's sake, my comics in the OU Daily will run on Fridays, it seems.  It's as good a reason as any to read the school paper, I guess.  I also spent way more money today than I should have.  Not on dinner and bowling--no, those are very acceptable and good uses of money, and I don't regret them at all.  No, I'm referring to the fact that I went and bought a GameCube.  Why?  Because I'm tired of not having a decent game system, and because I've been saving money for one.  I've only got one controller right now (and since part of the reason I purchased this thing was to do multiplayer games, that'll have to change), and only one game--Rogue Squadron II--Rogue Leader (Star Wars game!  Woo!).  No memory card, so I can't save anything (which means I get to keep flying the mission against the Death Star every time I turn the thing on...which isn't necessarily a  bad  thing), but I've ordered a memory card, and I should have it in a week or so.  I really probably shouldn't have bought the GameCube, to be honest.  Money's gonna get tight here pretty soon, and so will time.  But I'm of the opinion--an opinion I've held for several years now--that you can't just work all the time.  Sometimes, you need to unwind, cut loose, and shoot down some TIE fighters, y'know?  Or play some MarioKart.  Or Smash Brothers Melee.  Or Zelda.  Or Soul Calibur II, which also happens to feature Link of Legend of Zelda kickin' some serious ass.  Etc., etc.  Really, that's mostly rationalization, and I know it.  I also know my spending habits need to improve greatly, or I could be in serious trouble.  I keep telling myself, "okay, no more spending after this," and then I go and spend more.  But I really do need to stop now.  I'm not going to buy anymore games or movies or CDs or anything like that for a long time now.  I probably need outside help with this, so anyone who feels like trying to mother me (other that my actual mother--she'll just yell at me), let me know.  I need someone to keep me on the straight and narrow in these matters.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Band, "The Weight"

       "Chirpping Crickets"   A  urlLink short story  is now posted, called "Communication Breakdown."  It's part of an exercise I'm doing in conjunction with Monica to see how we each handle the vague topic of a communcation breakdown.  We're looking to write some sort of story together, but first we need to understand each other's writing style and such.  Hope you like it.  Feel free to comment on it.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: George Harrison, "Let it down"

       "Crooked Prose"   Well, I went and made a  urlLink Live Journal  account.  Originally, I was going to just move all the content of this journal to that one.  Then, I hit upon a better idea, one which required less work on my part--why not just post short stories and other literary endeavours over there, and keep this one as the more traditional blog?  I liked the idea, and it seemed to include a lot less work (like, y'know, not having to go back and upload every single entry I've written since mid-October and backdate the whole lot of 'em.  That was gonna suck).  The other reason I decided to use that one for short stories is that it has an option for people to make comments (something I haven't quite worked out how to do here).  Most people probably don't care to comment on the rubbish I write here, though they may want to comment on the rubbish I write prose-wise.    So yeah, I should have a short story posted over there later this afternoon.  I'll probably mention it over here when I do.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: George Harrison, "My Sweet Lord"

       "This Place Won't Speak Its Language To Me"   For the past about week now, I've felt like a ghost wandering around Norman, not really interacting with anyone on any sort of deep level.  Most of my contact with humanity has been through electronic means, whether via telephone or the internet.  Admittedly, I've had some very deep contact (via the internet especially) this past week, but I still feel disconnected from my surroundings, like someone who is dead but comes alive for the brief moments it takes to interact with someone on a purely mechanical level, such as paying for groceries or saying hello to the person I just held the door open for.  You'd think something like the latter would require interaction, but doing things like holding open the door is so automatic to my existence, it doesn't even require thought anymore.  There's someone behind me, I hold the door for them, whether male or female (though I've noticed I tend to smile at them if they're female, regardless of whether I find them attractive or not).  But it's all very strange to me, really, and vaguely disconcerting.  I've talked with a couple of my Norman friends since returning, but I've only seen two of them--Dom when he took me to pick up my car on Tuesday, and Ev at work.  The former was a brief encounter, mostly saying, "yeah, I had a good break, how was yours?"  The latter was in a work setting, when I was leaving and Ev was coming in, so again brief and with much the same tone and tenor to it.  Not to mention the fact that he's been sick since I picked him up from the bus station Sunday, concentrating on a job application, and thus nowhere near as talkative or animated as usual.  I guess I'm just really craving intimate face to face contact right now.  I just need to be able to sit with a close friend, have a good, solid conversation, and remember that I'm not completely isolated in this ridiculous town.  Everyone in Norman seems so wrapped up in their mundane little lives that they completely ignore everyone around them.  Sure, it's pretty much that way everywhere, but you'd think a few people could at least take the time to smile at you while you're interacting.  The only person who's done so in the past week was the waitress I had at Coach's yesterday for lunch, and I ended up leaving her a 50% tip for it.  I'm not really sure what all is truly bugging me.  There's something at the core of these feelings I have right now, and I can't identify them.  Maybe it was the too-brief visit with Chris and JP, the reminder of what we had at Ozarks and the intimacy of my life there.  Maybe it's the fact that I haven't seen so many of my friends in too long, or that I didn't get to see Wendy over break.  Or maybe it's even the idea that my middle sibling is off in France as we speak, doing God-knows what (actually, it's 9.00 pm here, so it's about 6.00 am there.  He's either still asleep or just waking up, so I guess I have a good idea what he's currently doing).  Maybe it's something as simple as just flat-out loneliness.  I've been known to get lonely in crowded rooms before, so it's possible.  Most of all, I think it's just that there are a couple of very specific people I wish I were with right now.  Sadly, that is not the case, so I'm stuck here in Norman and as a shade.  But maybe not for long, who knows.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: George Harrison, "Isn't it a Pity (Version One)"

       "Signs That Might Be Omens"   It's still much too quiet in Norman right now.  So few of my friends are actually here right now...or rather, I'm aware of only a few of them actually being in town.  But I know that'll all change this weekend, when everyone comes back and when I get back into the semester grind.  On Sunday I have two meetings--one for the school paper (I apparently have the Friday slot for my cartoon), and another for work (and my boss is feeding us, which is always nice).  It feels like I've sort of wasted most of the week.  I meant to do a lot of research this week so I could start working on my Thesis in earnest.  But instead, I had to deal with standing in line an entire afternoon at the Bursar's Office and with going to the Housing Office to tell them to stop trying to charge me a late fee on something that wasn't late.  Admittedly, those are just excuses; if I was serious about getting my research done, I'd have done it, plain and simple.  And that rather worries me--just how serious am I about getting this degree finished, and about getting a PhD?  I mean, I say I want to teach History, and I know a big part of me truly does.  But then there's also a little voice that says, "that's too much work, and is it really worth all that work?"  Of course, there's also the delusional voice that keeps telling me I could make a living with my creative endeavours, such as Crooked Halo or my writing or music.  And that voice is quiet delusional--I don't have enough readers for the Halo to support me financially (especially since most of the Dim Bulb readership are poor college students like myself who can barely support themselves), and I don't have any writing that's ready to be published (short stories aren't worth enough to live off of).  I also don't harbor any illusions about just how well I sing.  Clif and I's songs are good, I know they are; I'm just probably not the one who will sing them if they ever get us a record contract.  I'd like to imagine I could become a professional songwriter, though I don't know if I'd be comfortable with someone else singing my songs (and that is how I think of them.  I've very possessive of my intellectual property).  I also don't think that the kind of musicians who'd sing my songs need professional songwriters.  That's the problem with my lyrical style--I fall firmly into the singer-songwriter genre, though I'm not all that good of a singer.  Call me a latter-day Bob Dylan.  Unfortunately, I'm not attractive enough to the general public to make that sort of thing work.  Sure, back in the '60s, when folks cared more about your message than your image, I could have been a contender, but in today's visual and aesthetic-dominated music industry, I'd never make it.  Besides, I despise the record industry, and can't afford to do much on my own.  It's all a rather academic exercise, really.  I don't know what my future really holds yet, and by "future" I mean "a few months away."  I literally have no idea what will happen when I graduate.  Oh, I know I will, because despite my plodding and foot dragging, I know I'll get this Thesis hammered out in good time when it gets down to the crunch.  It's just a question of where and what after that.  Will I stay in Oklahoma for the summer?  Or will I take dad's idea and head off for wherever it is I'm bound in the Fall early and find myself a job?  That sounds like the best idea, except that wherever I go, I'm going to know no one, and that thought still frightens me a lot.  I don't like the idea of being alone, and never really have.  To paraphrase Nick Hornby, only people of a certain disposition are afraid of being alone at age 23, and I am of that disposition, I guess.  I was of that disposition when I was 18, I think, and that's really kind of worrying.  It probably tells you more about my personality than you might have wanted to know.  I'm...needy, I guess.  Ah well.  All those worries can be left to the future.  For now, I just need to take it one moment at a time, a day at a time.  And today's going to be enough, what with my mother and youngest sibling coming for a visit.  This is going to be an exercise in self-destruction, as I know that my mediocre cleaning job yesterday is not going to be up to mom's standards.  And you know what?  I bloody well don't care.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Free, "All Right Now"

       "Letters From The Wasteland"   I was cleaning up the apartment this afternoon, going through boxes and figuring out what was in them, when I came across a metal box that I keep sentimental stuff and keepsakes and the like in.  It has photos of old friends, old letters and notes, newspaper clippings, things of that nature.  So, because I'm easily distracted from what I'm supposed to be doing (cleaning so mom doesn't have a heart attack when she comes to visit tomorrow), I stopped and read some of the stuff in the box.  And what I found was interesting, and something I had almost forgotten about.  Most of the letters and notes and whatnot in the box are written by one of two people--either myself, or Wen, though some of the notes are us gibbering at each other back and forth.  It was an interesting read, and I felt rather nostalgic for a good bit.  I'm a sentimental person by nature, and this was hitting me write in the sentimentality bone, if there is such a thing (work with me here, folks).  The letters and poems reminded me of things and feelings I hadn't paid heed to in years.  It all brought back a flood of memories--late night phone conversations, whispered in the dark under the covers; making up stuff about going to the library so we could really go out and park the car and make out (we were kinda innocent, it never went any further than kissing); writing letters and poems back and forth to one another professing undying love and affection until the sun was extinguished.  We were so serious about all of it, and it took me a long time to get over the fact that she didn't want to spend the rest of her life with me like that.  I've since come to terms with it, and we're still the best of friends, and I can't wait to see her in February and to meet her boyfriend, Tim.  But I think I've been trying to find someone like her ever since, which probably isn't fair to her or to other women.  But as a person, she possesses so many of the qualities I look for in anyone, regardless of whether I want to date that person or not.  At the risk of sounding cliche, she is one in a million, probably more.  I've never met anyone quite like her, and I'm still trying to find someone who lives their life with as much energy and pure joy as she does.  Even when things are hard, or not going her way, she is still more alive than nine of ten people you'll meet on the street.  I think every creative endeavour I've embarked on has been inspired by her in some way or another, whether directly or indirectly.  She challenged me to be better than I was, and only a few people since then have done that.  I treasure those people, as I treasure all of my friends, but she is my muse, if you'll forgive the sappiness.  I'm pretty sure she knows all this already, and I'm not even sure if she reads this or not.    I realize in typing all this that I've probably revealed more about myself and my past than I wanted to initially, but I'm not removing any of it.  If I bare my soul here, and someone doesn't like what they read, that's their problem, not mine.  Besides, this is supposed to be about self-expression, right?  One of the notes I wrote, sometime around when we were getting ready to graduate high school, struck me as slightly amusing in hindsight.  I was detailing my beliefs regarding what makes us who we are, and I made the claim that we are the past.  Everything that makes us who we are--our memories, our ideas and thoughts, the things we've done--they all exist in the past, and thus we are now made up of what we were then.  I had to chuckle a bit at this, because I don't believe that at all now.  I think I actually believe something completely contradictory to that, really.  I don't think we're made up of the past.  We are not  now  who we were  then .  The past is a foreign country, one which you can't visit because you lost your passport.  We have postcards of the past, and we call them memories.  In many cases, we have photographic evidence of what we were, and these are rather like the vacation photos your parents take so many of and then stick in a photo album and never look at unless guests they don't like come to visit.  All joking aside, we are so much more than what we were.  The past is a part of us, yes, but we are something different from that now.  And we can't keep dwelling on who we were, or we lose who we  are , and I'm just now figuring out who that is.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Mark Knopfler, "Speedway at Nazareth"

       "Back In The Saddle"   Got my car back yesterday, good as new.  The guys at the body shop were even so kind as to wash and detail it for me, so my car is all shiny and clean and pretty and whole again, and no more rattling from the rear end.  Yes, that is good.  Today marks the beginning of a quick little something over at  urlLink Dim Bulb  that I'm going to enjoy thoroughly.  I'm running a little series of comics that feature a character of Ping Teo's from  urlLink The Jaded , a guy named Juno.  I did a little fanart comic for Ping a couple of months along similar lines, which was what eventually sparked the idea I'm currently pursuing.  Part of me is always thoroughly amused by making fun of boy bands, don't ask me why.  Probably because it's so easy, rather like caf jokes.  Shifting gears, I was reading a friend of mine's blog the other day, and in between cringing because of her grammar and her complete disregard for the rules of the English language, I noticed she posed a very interesting question, one which I've in turned been mulling over since reading her thoughts yesterday.  What if I died today?  I'm not trying to be morbid, just hypothetical.  How would I be remembered?  By whom would I be remembered?  Would folks think of the good things I did, the happiness I (hopefully) brought to the lives of those I've known?  Or would they dwell on the stupid things I did?  Or perhaps on the things I left undone, such as schoolwork and the like.  Would those whom I love dearly know that I love them?  I like to think they would, just as I like to think I'd be remembered for the good and joyful things I did, assuming there are any.  It's probably conceited of me to say this, but I like to think I'd be well-remembered by everyone I know.  Except for maybe a couple of people, and I probably don't give a damn about those people anyway.  I also kinda wonder what would become of my estate, as it were.  My personal possessions--what would happen to them?  I'm not talking about my movies or CDs or that sort of stuff.  I'm thinking about my intellectual property here.  What would become of my sketchbooks and notebooks crammed with comics, short stories, story ideas and snippets, poems, songs, thoughts and words and things that only I've ever seen?  Would someone ransack my apartment, searching through each book and stack of paper (and there are many of each) looking for things of worth?  Would they find any?  I have three sketchbooks there, all full of comics.  Only about a quarter of them have ever seen the light of day, some because they're not that good, some because I don't know how to draw them in a way I'd be happy with, and some because I have not reached that point in the stories I'm telling yet.  Would someone publish my unfinished comics in some posthumous collection, continue putting my stuff on Dim Bulb but drawn by someone else?  All silly questions, I know, but these are some of the things that run through my head.  I have little to no control over my thoughts; they occur as they will, and I can sometimes focus on a single thought, but I can't stop the torrent of other thoughts that flood through my cranium on a constant basis.  It's like trying to plug a hole the size of your head with your finger.  It's not gonna work.  On an unrelated note, I wanted to relate part of a conversation I had with my coworker, Ev, yesterday.  I was talking about Clif heading off to France, and how he was probably going to be something of an unholy terror while there.  Clif has this way of shaping the world around him to suit his tastes.  He can literally make people behave in ways they usually wouldn't.  I've seen him do it--he makes the world fit him.  It's not that he's a round peg trying to fit into a square hole or anything like that, but rather that he's a round peg forcing the square hole to become a round one.  He and the French ought to get along like a house on fire--lots of smoke, screaming, and the chance that there won't be many survivors.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Newsboys, "Shine"

       "Takin' Care Of Business"   Well, I'm back at work again, finally.  Admittedly, it's on a rather reduced schedule right now, but considering I usually don't work at all between the end of Finals and the beginning of the Spring semester, this little bit will be welcomed when I suddenly have a little pocket money in a couple of weeks' time.  Speaking of reduced schedules, it looks like I'm running on one next semester so far.  My schedule reads something like 4.00-10.00 pm Sundays, and 7.00-10.00 pm Monday through Thursday.  That's something like (*pulls out calculator*)...18 hours a week right now.  A little over half what I was working last semester.  Lord, my paychecks are gonna shrink.  But hopefully, I'll be able to pick up extra hours as the semester progresses, perhaps in the early morning shift like I worked in the Fall.  Sure, I don't care much for waking up early, but I'll do what it takes to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.  And by "comfortable" I mean "able to continue feeding myself and paying rent."  I'm willing to wake up a bit earlier if it means I'll be able to go back to bed in my apartment at day's end.  Anyway, work's about all that's happening.  Oh, and I get my car back tomorrow.  It's about bloody time, too.  I swear, the next time a business professor backs into my car in the parking garage, I'm just going to beat him unconscious.  It'd be preferable to his usual state, anyway.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Van Morrison, "Brown-Eyed Girl"

       "Get In Line"   Let it be known that the University of Oklahoma Bursar's Office stole three hours of my life this afternoon.  Yes, I stood in a freakin' line for   three hours   just so I could pay OU $449 and find out that I have to go to a different office (that of Housing and Food Services) to take care of the stupid late charge that's on my bill.  A late charge which, I might add, is only on there because they didn't realize I paid last month's rent on time, the morons.  This was part of what I liked about Ozarks--all of that crap was in one place.  And if it wasn't in one place, the other place you had to go was within a two minute walk.  And if the person you needed to talk to wasn't in their office, you knew where they were.  And they didn't give you freakin' hassles like I've had to deal with the whole time I've been at OU.  I swear, the only thing that's made my stay at this God forsaken place worthwhile is the friends I've made, a couple of the professors, and the fact that I'll have a Master's Degree at the end of it, and even all that's starting to pale in comparison to the unbelievable amount of crap I have to go through each time I get a bill from this damn school.  I swear, I shouldn't have to deal with this much crap each time I get a bill, and that's exactly what it seems like happens.  I spent three, four months last year trying to get them to remove one damn late charge from my account, and another few months trying to convince them to not charge me for a class I wasn't taking because they'd accidentally double-billed me for a class.  Every single problem I've had with finances and such at this school has been because of their incompetence, and I'm getting tired of the run-around I have to deal with each time their stupid asses make mistakes.  Y'know what's really funny, though?  I bet there are students out there who wouldn't question the extra charges, or the double-billing on tuition, or anything like that.  They'd just pay for everything and go along their merry way, none the wiser.  I think that's why the school keeps these stupid little bugs in their system--it's like free money.  Stay tuned for our next episode, when I'll be illuminating other conspiracies, such as where cafeteria food really comes from and what it's really made of, and the location of Jimmy Hoffa's body.  Yes, they're connected in exactly the way that sentence is meant to make you think they are.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Bob Dylan, "Mississippi"

       "Retraction"   So, in yet another example of "Chuck's the biggest idiot ever," it turns out I  was  reading the site stats wrong.  According to Adam, we were probably getting 4 or 5 hits per day, and that seems a little more accurate at this time of the year, if just a bit depressing and deflating.  For a moment, I thought that perhaps we were something huge, that we'd finally started moving down the path to notoriety, or at least some sort of infamy, and it turns out that I was completely wrong.  Wee, talk about a downer.  So yeah, it looks like I was looking at the monthly totals instead of the daily totals.  Big surprise there, eh?  This is why I should just stick to drawing comics and writing words from now on, and not worry about the numbers.  The numbers just confuse and upset me, and I don't need that.  Speaking of numbers confusing and upsetting, OU lost the Sugar Bowl last night, which is gonna make work a pain in the ass for a while.  I really don't want to deal with mopey football players, y'know?  We now return you to your regularly-scheduled ranting, already in progress.  ...and that's when I knew he'd handed me the secret of life, of eternal and complete happiness, and that I'd thrown it away with my luch trash.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Bruce Springsteen, "I'm Going Down"

       "Just Ego Tripping"   If I'm reading things right--and I'm not sure that I am--then according to the statistics  urlLink Keenspace  generates for our  urlLink site , we're getting something like an average of 226 unique hits a day.  But I've gotta be reading it wrong, that's the only thing I can determine.  Adam and I together don't know that many people, especially since many of the people we do know overlap.  There's no way that nearly 200 people  I don't even know  visit Dim Bulb on an average day.  That's just insane, right?  Even if I'm reading the statistic wrong, and it's only half that...or even if it's the 155 Total Sites statistic (I can never remember if we go by Total Sites or Total Visits, or even if it's either one)...can there really be that many people visiting that I don't know?  It's hard to believe.  Even if I find that hard to believe, another stat generated by Keenspace seems to verify it: in the Official Keenspace Guide, which lists all the Keenspace comics, there's a percentage of pageviews listed with your comic name.  This percentage is basically the total percentage of all pages hosted by Keenspace that are viewed by anyone that happen to be your comic.  Ours usually hangs at around 0.026 (keep in mind there are roughly 10,000 Keenspace comics, most of which have a 0.000 percentage).  When I checked today, on a whim, it was up to 0.036.  Perhaps that does account for the increase in total visitors to the page, I don't know.  Whatever has happened, if there are more people visiting the site, I wish a few of them would let us know they're actually doing so.  It'd just be nice to hear from these people we don't actually know.  And if it's all true, then hey--perhaps there's hope for Dim Bulb to become the uberpopular webcomic Adam and I feel it deserves to be.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: David Gray, "Silver Lining"

       "Funky New Year"   Hey everyone.  I hope you all had a wonderful New Year, as I know I did.  I hung out with Chris and Jennifer, my former roommates (well, one was a roommate, the other was a de facto roommate) over at her parents' place in Midwest City.  We sat up watching movies, shooting the bull, and basically just acting like we were still at Ozarks.  Then Thursday, Jennifer's parents fed me (I'm never one to pass up a free home-cooked meal.  I'm not an idiot, after all), and Chris, JP, and myself went and played pool with Jennifer's sister and a friend of said sister.  Then I came back to Norman.  In the meantime, Clif apparently forgot how to read the instructions I left him on how to work his minidisc player, and against all probability managed to screw things up pretty good.  I swear, he's got some sort of plague hand when it comes to electronics.  Worse even than my mother.  But I think he got it resolved eventually.  He damn well better have, anyway, because I don't want to have to try and coach him on the thing over the phone again.  Anyway, by all rights and reason, I should be in bed right now, as I have to wake up early and take my car into the shop to get the bumper replaced.  Of course, that wouldn't make any sense now, would it?  Going to bed so I can have a decent night's sleep and can get my car to the shop on time.  Haha, what a funny man I am.  Granted, I didn't wake up until noon, so I guess it only makes sense that I'm not really tired after only 14 hours of consciousness.  I keep trying to figure out what my New Year's Resolutions are going to be.  I know of a few I need to make, such as the cliched "lose some weight," "finish what I start," "stick to my schedules," and "stop trying to make my neighbors' heads explode using my mind powers," but I also think there ought to be something more...original and personal.  Like "make Dim Bulb Comics the best damn comics site on the internet."  "Manage to get paid to do what I love, whether it's write or draw or music."  "Eradicate the source of crappy music."  Something like that.  I have lots of dreams, lots of hopes, and I can only hope that I'll maybe reach a couple of them this year.  Getting into one of the graduate schools I applied to would be a nice step in the right direction.  I know that both Dr. Dippel and Dr. Hart wrote private letters to David Cressy at Ohio State (my top US choice)  in addition to  the letters of recommendation they wrote to the university proper.  I also got one to Ohio State from the President of the University of the Ozarks.  I'm hoping credentials like those will go a long way towards getting me accepted and funded.  That would be wonderful.  Everyone always goes on about how the New Year is a time to start over, to take stock of one's life, decide where you want to go, and make steps towards it.  I guess I'm trying to do that, but really I'm not sure if I have a clean slate.  Some of the stuff that was hanging over my head last year is still hanging there, oblivious to the ticking over of the cosmic odometer.  Perhaps the New Year will grant me renewed, refreshed energy, and I can get some things done and over with.  Here's to your new year, wherever you are, whatever you are doing, and whoever you are with--cheers, best of luck, and lots of love.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Barenaked Ladies, "The War on Drugs"

       "Shine On You Crazy Diamond"   So I was sitting in the library yesterday afternoon, having found and checked out a bagful of books for my 20th Century Europe paper.  I was waiting on Beth to finish her research, and she asked me to look at her latest paper for Tech Writing.  So she hands it to me and I start looking at it, and she mentions something about, "Yeah, you can actually make real corrections on this paper, unlike the ones at work."  I laughed and proofread the paper.  The irony of that only just hit me--the paper I can do the most to, because the NCAA doesn't restrict what I do with people who aren't athletes, is the one that needs the least corrections.  Sweet, sweet irony.  In other news, I've got comics drawn for Monday and Wednesday.  I'll hopefully get the comic for Friday drawn, too, and maybe have the little storyline I'm in the middle of wrapped up sometime next week.  We'll see.  We'll see.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Pink Floyd, "Shine on you Crazy Diamond, Parts VI-IX"

       "Slowly Breaking Through At Daylight"   I woke up this morning--okay, this afternoon--in a bad mood, and I don't know why.  I was grumpy, and not knowing why I'm grumpy only makes me grumpier.  I feel like a lifelong smoker who's given up cigarettes after 40 or 50 years, and the nicotine fits are manifesting themselves as snappish behavior and the urge to rip the juggular out of the throat of anyone who crosses me.  And today, crossing me only requires the wrong tone of voice or the least little idyosyncrisy.  For instance, the idiot who nearly backed into me in the convenience store parking lot because he wasn't looking when he was backing out.  I was standing in the parking lot, cursing the guy out just under my breath (and only just barely...the urge to yell at him was almost overwhelming).  Or the guy who was behind me in the parking garage when I was trying to park, who reved his engine and was driving (in my opinion) way too fast inside the parking garage.  And then he's sitting there, blabbing away on his cell phone, waiting for the damn elevator even though we're only two flights of steps up from the ground floor.  I wanted to scream at him several times, both for driving like a freakin' idiot, for yaking on the damn cell phone like it was an organic part of his body, and then again for being too damn lazy to walk down two flights of stairs.  And then, despite the fact that I was on the ground floor well before he, he actually got into the stadium before I did, because he found a closer gate that was unlocked (there are only like two unlocked gates today, it seems, and he found the easier, faster one).  So I was cursing under my breath, wondering how this moron got into the stadium before I did.  I have no idea what's wrong with me.  I should be in a good mood.  Yesterday was a good, albeit long, day, and today is absolutely gorgeous.  I think it rained earlier--I heard rain when I woke up at one point, and the ground was wet when I left for work--but it's perfect outside right now.  Just a bit of a cool breeze, the sun is shining bright, and the temperature is as near to perfect as I could ask for.  So why am I in such a foul mood?  Part of it is probably just my extremely messed up sleep pattern.  There really isn't one right now, and I was awake for about 22 hours yesterday.  That's a long freakin' day.  I'm also a little sore.  The hotel bed Friday night was not the most comfortable thing in the world (a bed of nails might have been more comfortable), so my neck and shoulders are still a little tight and sore.  I'm also missing caffine.  I had no idea how much soda pop I was drinking until I stopped drinking it, and suddenly the lack of tasty carbonated beverage is affecting me.  It's weird--a liquid shouldn't have this sort of effect on my life.  Those are all just excuses, though, just rationalizations for why I feel like taking out my bad mood on other people.  And I do feel like doing that, and having to sit here at work for 8 hours isn't going to improve that any.  Thankfully, I'm working with Vicki and Ev today.  It's hard to stay in a bad mood around Vicki, who has too much energy and has already seen more bitter things in life than I ever will, and Ev always helps me put things in perspective and offers plenty of sympathy.  Ah well--it'll all work out.  A couple of good nights' sleep, and I'll be right as rain...or ramen.  I dunno, whatever.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Counting Crows, "Goodnight Elisabeth"

       "Rock The House"   Ladies and gentlemen, I  own  graduate non-American history in the state of Oklahoma.  I  am  graduate non-American history in this state.  Like some sort of latter-day historical ubermensch, I swoop out of the sky, present a paper, and win first place at the annual Phi Alpha Theta Conference with it.  None can stand against me, and all who oppose me are crushed under my mighty black dress shoe!  So yeah, the history conference went well today.  Got first place graduate non-American history paper for the second year in a row.  Too bad I won't be here next year to do it again.  At least, I assume I won't.  There's no telling.  In other news, my grandfather went in for surgery earlier today to have some blockage removed from his neck (his artery was like 90% blocked, apparently).  According to my parents, who went to see him after they watched me present my paper this morning, he's doing just fine, and will be able to go home tomorrow afternoon, so that's good.  Mom also felt the need (for reasons I shall never really comprehend) to describe in graphic detail exactly what the stuff they removed looked like.  I won't be passing that information along, because it still makes me a bit queasy.  But all's well with that.  Still no word from Ohio State or Wash. U.  My patience is fairly strong, but it's also starting to run a bit thin.  I'm tired of waiting.  I'd really kinda like to know what my future holds.  But I'm not giving up yet--perhaps I can email an updated vita with today's victory added to it to the heads of the departments at Ohio State and Wash. U.  Worth a shot, anyway.  Oh, and I think I figured out what bothered me about  The Passion of Christ .  As I suspected, it's related to the violence, but it's not that it's a violent movie.  That I can handle.  It's that they never really give you any reason for why Jesus was so feared by the Jewish leaders.  They never really give you more than tiny snippets of His ministry, and then it's never enough to really understand the depth of His teachings or His ministry.  Admittedly, it's probably assumed that if you're attending this movie you already know all that stuff, but if you're attending this movie, don't you already also know what happens to Jesus?  Admittedly, it would've been hard to make a movie about the last twelve hours of Jesus's life and also include prime cuts of His teaching and ministry, but a little more (in those tantalizing flashbacks that worked so well) would've put the violence into better perspective, I think.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Blues Traveler, "But Anyway"

       "I've Seen The Kansas Of Your Sweet Little Myth"   Went and saw  The Passion of Christ  last night.  Many hours removed, I'm still not quite sure what to think about it.  I know one thing for sure--it was a decidedly violent movie.  Almost macabre in its violence, you might say, though I understand why it was done and why the violence bothered me.  Really, there was no more violence in this than, say, your average action/adventure movie.  Each installment of  LOTR  probably had twice as much violence in it.  But the difference was the spirit or the feeling of the violence.  In  LOTR , when you see Aragorn chop down an orc, you don't feel anything beyond, "dude, that looked really cool."  It's almost cartoonish violence, not real in a way.  The violence in  Passion  was not that way at all.  It seemed very real, very unnerving, and very painful.  Whoever did the makeup and CG effects for this movie did a phenomenal job, I can tell you that much.  I won't go into any of the gorey details; suffice to say, if you have a weak stomach, or are prone to feeling ill at the sight of blood, you may want to skip this.  It's not for the faint of heart.  The other significant issue with the violence was that the majority of it happened to one person.  In your typical action film, the violence is spread out.  The hero kills or beats up a few dozen or a few hundred faceless enemies, or maybe suffers a few blows himself, or a bruise or a grazing bullet wound or whatever.  But in  Passion , it's virtually all happening to Jesus, and you really wonder how one person could withstand such abuse.  And make no mistakes, he was abused.  Severely.  I noticed a number of people having to hide their eyes at key moments, and I can't say I blame them.  But what of the more important concerns with the film?  Was it really unfair to Jews, was it really anti-Semitic?  Did it fairly and accurately depict the last day of Jesus's life?  Hard to say, really.  Some of the Jewish characters in the film appear to be very wicked, almost caricatured individuals, Caiphas especially.  They seem downright demonic, with rotten teeth and nasty expressions.  They seem to goad the people into calling out for Jesus's death.  But then you also have Jewish characters who are not like that at all.  For every Jew calling for the crucifixion of Jesus, you have another weeping as He is dragged and whipped through the streets.  You have the Jewish man who is roped into helping Jesus carry the cross when He was too weak to continue by himself.  You have Mary, Peter, and Mary Magdelene, who seem to have nothing in common with the Jews who call for punishment and death.  Really, it's hard to say whether it was anti-Semitic or not.  Fact of the matter is, Jews did call for the death of Jesus.  If you're making a movie based on Gospel accounts, and the Gospels say "this is how it happened," that's how you have to say it happened.  Since the Gospels clearly indicate (at least, the Gospel of Matthew, which is rather more biased against the Jews than the other three) that Jesus was condemned by his own people, that's how you have to portray it.  Deeper issues--what does this movie do for faith?  Personally, something about the film bothered me.  I think it's the way it focused on the violence Jesus suffered, on the torture and pain He underwent.  I know that stuff is important to the Gospel account, and to the whole death and ressurection of Christ.  But should that be the point?  I always thought the purpose of the Easter story wasn't that Jesus suffered these horrible, horrible things, but that He overcame them, that He rose again as He said He would.  It's a story of hope, not one of anguish and pain and hatred.  I almost wonder if this movie focuses too much on the violence to the detriment of the message.  All told, I am glad I saw the movie.  It was a worthwhile experience, I think, and one that's left me thinking about what I believe and why I believe it.  In other, less religious news, I'm leaving tomorrow to present a history paper at the annual Oklahoma Phi Alpha Theta History Conference down in Lawton.  I should probably figure out how to get there before I leave.  I'm also rather annoyed that Bob Dylan is playing a show up in Tulsa Saturday night, and I won't get a chance to go see him because I won't get back from the conference in time to drive up to Tulsa.  I swear, school and my profession keep getting in the way of me attending kick ass rock concerts.  First McCartney, now this.  What's the world comin' to, I ask ya?  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Wallflowers, "One Headlight"

       "Out Into The Cool Of The Evening Strolls The Pretender"   Today was significantly better than the past few days have been.  I feel fitter, happier...well, happier, anyway.  The other will probably have to wait until I've lost a wee bit of weight (twenty or thirty pounds or so).  I came up with what I'm going to give up for Lent--soda pop.  I'm drinking at least a one liter a day, sometimes more, and that's way too damn much.  So I had my last one tonight, and tomorrow it's quitin' cold turkey.  I give it a couple of days before the caffine headaches start.  On a brighter note, though (I did say today was a better day), I got my first fanart today.  First two, actually.  Both of them came from  urlLink Ping , and they're both of Earl the Archangel.  The  urlLink first is Earl in chibi form , which is my current desktop background.  The  urlLink second  is Earl looking more like he does in  urlLink Troubled Times , which is to say "bad ass."  Needless to say, I was very flattered that Ping wanted to draw a character I came up with, and even moreso that she decided to draw him twice.  It just really made my day, and I really like how Ping interpreted the character.  This also means that Earl is the official mascot of Dim Bulb.  I mean, not only is he in all three comics, but someone other than Adam and myself has drawn him now.  It's settled--Earl, Dim Bulb Mascot.  We'll have to see if we can work up a background for that.  Work is relatively quiet.  Admittedly, it's not even half over, but that's hardly the point, is it?  I think I'm going to try to see The Passion tomorrow night, if they have really late showings here in Norman.  I know Jess, Beth, and Dom are all really enthused about the film, and I admit a curiosity born more of an academic, intellectual nature than anything else.  I want to see if it really is as anti-semitic as some quarters claim.  I want to see what he did with it.  I guess I want to see what all the hype's about.  There's also a spiritual part of me that thinks this could be a very powerful film and well-worth watching at least once.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Velvet Underground, "Oh, Sweet Nothin'"

       "There's Always A Siren Singing You To Shipwreck"   I was talking on the phone with my mother earlier this afternoon, and she mentioned to me that our church decided to fire the youth direction, who has been at UPC for about seven or eight years now.   Why?  They felt her job could be done by a couple of volunteers from the local Baptist college.  Admittedly, Rachel herself (the woman who was the youth director) and the guy who was youth director when I first joined the youth group way back in 1994 started out as college students volunteering.  But Rachel had become the full-time youth minister, and was doing so much with it--mission trips, gatherings, and so much more.  The church's reasoning?  Budget concerns.  It strikes me as sadly amusing that we keep thinking of the church as a business concern.  Admittedly, the church has business stuff that it needs to take care of--payroll, monthly bills, etc.--but isn't a church supposed to concern itself more with its world mission than with money concerns?  As long as the church still operates, does it matter if it makes or loses money?  Oddly enough, the church actually has plenty of money.  However, most of the money we have is earmarked for specific things--erecting a new building, missionaries, things like that.  The money's usually not donated to the church for the payment of the minister and other church employees.  As my mom commented, we'll end up like the other Presbyterian Church in Shawnee ended up (before it merged with our church)--we'll have plenty of money that we can't spend, and no one attending the church.  So many members have already left, so many will probably leave now that the youth director's gone, and God only knows how the poor interum pastor is supposed to handle all this.  On an unrelated note, let me share a new (well, new to me) webcomic that I just finished reading today-- urlLink Digital War , which I found through  urlLink The Jaded  and recognized as a prolifict poster on the  urlLink Keenspace Forums .  Digital War is an interesting read, and well-drawn.  The current storyline is a quasi-LOTR parody with some nice twists, and the main character, War, rocks your socks.  So go check it out.  There'll probably be a link to it over at  urlLink Dim Bulb  as soon as I get around to it.  In other news, I finally beat Final Fantasy Tactics Advance this afternoon.  Seventy-six hours plus of gameplay.  Good game, though.  Of course, now I'm without a game to play for the GBA, having beaten everything I have...oh, wait, except MarioKart.  Still have that!  But that's not really one you "beat," per se.  ...yeah, need a new game.  Or I guess I  could  start working on things like my thesis...maybe....  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Radiohead, "There There"

       "I Need For You To Be Reasonable"   My folks came up earlier today to bring me some stuff for next weekend.  Just clothes, really, so that I have something nice to wear to the gathering on Friday night of all the stuffy historians.  We're a rather musty bunch, really, and I wonder just how exciting a gathering of historians with nothing to discuss but small talk will go.  Probably be lots of people talking about their research.  Or politics.  God, I hope I don't have to discuss politics.  It's bad enough that so many of my friends are actually interested in politics.  I can tolerate that, because we also discuss other, more interesting things.  But these people whom I have little to nothing in common with aside from the fact that we're all halfway interested in the same broad, general subject (i.e., history)...I really don't want to have to talk politics with them.  Or shop, for that matter.  I mean, 90% of them are Americanists, not Europeanists.  And the Europeanists are usually as dry, dull, and boring as the Americanists, except that they can be dry and dull and boring about so much more history than the Americanists.  Maybe I'll get lucky and there'll be an open bar.  All that being said, I am sorta looking forward to this conference.  I enjoy presenting papers, oddly enough (especially given how bad I used to get stage fright when I was in high school).  It's also good training for teaching, and a nice way to get my name out there (last year, I had professional historians I didn't even know asking for a copy of the paper I'd written...that's rather heartwarming, really).  That sort of thing also looks good on your  vita .  So yeah, mom and dad came up and brought me some new clothes.  Rather nice ones, too.  Then dad raided my CD collection.  I think half of my classic rock CDs are now in his possession, and the only reason he didn't take some of the others was that Clif has them back at home, and Clif is currently in no place to be able to use or even have access to his CD collection.  In other news, I'm trying to battle my sense of depression and frustration in a traditional way--by impulse shopping.  I bought an anime DVD I'd been wanting last night, and I bought a CD this afternoon before work (Soul Coughing's greatest hits...nifty set).  So far, it hasn't worked as well as I'd hoped.  Ah well--maybe I'll cheer up when Beth shows up later.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Radiohead, "2 + 2 =5"

       "To Wash You Out From My Mind, Out Of My Consciousness"   Y'know how I've been complaining that I haven't heard a single word from any of the graduate schools I applied to?  Well, I heard a word from one of them today.  Unfortunately, the word was "no."  Yeah, the University of Wisconsin decided they didn't want me.  On the positive side, they weren't my top pick (apparently I wasn't their top pick, either).  I also didn't have any connections there.  At Washington University in St. Louis, I've had a personal interview with the head of the History Department.  At Ohio State, both my graduate and undergraduate advisors are friends with the guy I'd be working with, and both wrote personal letters to the guy at Ohio State on my behalf in addition to the standard letters of recommendation.  So what started out as a decent day turned out crappy.  But until about 4.00 pm, it was a great day.  I woke up early--not necessarily a  great  thing, per se, but I was getting up to go up to OKC to the Metropolitan Library's annual book sale.  I found about a dozen books I wanted--everything from a book about the Second World War by Churchill to a collection of writings by James Thurber to Vonnegut.  Then I came home and, instead of cleaning the apartment as I'd originally intended, I slept.  Well, I really did need the sleep--I only slept for three hours last night.  Then I woke up, checked the mail, got my rejection letter, went to Borders, found a book Wendy'd recommended to me, went to Hastings and got a movie I'd been wanting, and then came home.  I had comfort food, watched anime, and vegged out.  Then I cleaned the apartment, so it's not too bad now.  Mom'll still have a small animal of the bovine persuasion when she arrives tomorrow, but my apartment could be immaculate and illicit that sort of response from her.  She's my mother, after all.  Anyway, beyond that, not much happened today.  Talked on the phone quite a bit, mostly with my parents but also with Jessica, whom I hadn't talked to since the 1964 concert a couple weeks ago.  I also found a CD that my youngest brother, Scott, has been wanting, so I picked that up for him.  I just keep going back to that rejection letter, though.  It's cast into doubt everything I thought was certain.  I used to believe my life would move in a very linear fashion.  I knew where I was, where I wanted to be, and I thought the path between the two was very easy, and very straight.  Now I find there are twists, turns, and areas without guardrails.  There are parts of the road with potholes the size of meteorite impact craters, and they're hiding in puddles so that I can't discern their depth.  I'm starting to feel very anxious, very frustrated, and even more envious of my friends who've already been contacted by the schools of their choice and told they're going to be receiving a pot of money to come and get an education.  Part of me wants to scream out, "it's not fair!"  Another part is muttering, "duh, of course it's unfair.  That's how life is."  I want to cry out to the universe, "You're not fair!"  And I guess I expect the universe to respond, "Oh, I'm not?  Well then..."  It won't change anything, and probably won't make me feel any better about it, since the universe isn't going to change just because I say so.  Stupid universe.  I don't want to be bitter again.  I've been there, done that.  Bitterness at the universe is a very pointless exercise, since the universe is rather apathetic to what we think and want.  The universe is a bitch.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Soul Coughing, "St. Louise is Listening"

       "Just Thinkin' Of A Series Of Dreams"   So Friday was a good day.  We got paid (always a plus), I hung out with Ev for his birthday (which was the 14th, but guess why no one was available to do anything on  that  day), and proved that I'm a geeky fanboy by purchasing the  urlLink Megatokyo Volume 2  book at Hastings.  Very nifty stuff, with a bunch of extras that aren't on the website.  Now if they'd just get around to getting the first volume reprinted, I'd be set...  Anyway, it was a good day, as stated, but a strange one.  Ev and I had lunch at an international food store down the street from our apartment complex.  Gyros, humus, and a bunch of other stuff with names I cannot remember, and which I could not pronounce even if I  could  remember.  Most of it was just...odd, and not really to my taste at all.  The humus was especially weird, and nothing that I would eat of my own accord.  It was an interesting cullinary experience, but not something I'll repeat anytime soon or with any regularity.  Also tracked down a DVD for Beth that she's been looking for (the second Harry Potter flick, actually).  Everyone we've looked, it's been bloody expensive (still like $23, which is ridiculous considering it really wasn't even as good as the first one).  Anyway, found it used at a store today for $8, and it was in excellent shape, so I snapped it up.  She was much appreciative of it.  In the morning, I'm heading up to Oklahoma City for the Metro Library Book Sale.  My folks gave me a bit of money to purchase books specifically in this instance.  My parents are really kinda weird, I've decided--on the one hand, my mother berates me for the stupid stuff I do (and the important stuff I should do that I haven't done) every time I speak with them.  Then they turn around and spoil me, whether it's giving me money to buy random books or by purchasing me clothes specifically for the history conference next weekend on what I think is a whim.  Which they actually did--there was a message on my voicemail from my mom informing me she'd purchased an "outfit" for me for next weekend.  I only hope it's not a sailor hat and a jock strap, or the historical community could be in serious trouble.  Yeah, have I mentioned the history conference next weekend?  I'm presenting the paper I wrote last semester for my 19th Century Europe class in an abridged form.  Yeah, it's only 12 pages instead of 25.  I actually couldn't cut anymore of the paper without losing vital parts of the argument.  I'm curious to see how this one fares as compared to the one I presented last year, which took first place in the graduate non-American section.  On a related note, the paper I'm working on for my 20th Century Europe class this semester--which takes the  Lord of the Rings  and Tolkein and proposes that the novels actually reflect his own peculiar anxieties and concerns as a Briton in the 1940s and 1950s, particularly with the idea of the British race "failing"--I'm hoping will be good enough (and original enough) to submit to a Tolkein conference in England that's going to be held sometime next year.  Can you imagine me presenting a paper on the  Lord of the Rings  in  England ?  How much of a dream come true would that be?  Dunno how likely it is, but there's always hope.  I've been in a weird mood the past few days.  I wasn't able to really pinpoint what it was or why it was occurring until earlier this evening when I was briefly visiting with Beth.  She's already heard back from both of her top choices for graduate school--Florida State and Miami.  Both meterology programs (two of the best in the country, especially for hurricane research, which is what she wants to do) accepted her, and with impressive fellowships at that.  She only sent out her applications over Christmas break.  I also know that Amanda Erisman has already heard from at least Tulsa, and was accepted there with a good fellowship, if I remember correctly.  Yet I've not heard from any of my schools yet, and I applied back in early to mid- November .  I guess part of it is envy.  Florida State--Beth's top choice--is offering her full tuition and a $22K living stipend.  I'm sure Miami's will be similar.  I don't know what Amanda's being offered by Tulsa, though I'm sure it's good.  Both of them are doing science--Beth is meterology, and Amanda is biology.  Both are very hot fields right now.  Meanwhile, history--and most of the rest of the humanities, for that matter--are flooded, bloated with too many PhDs.  I'm an above average historian at least, but in a time when excellent historians are a dime a dozen, is above average good enough?  One has to wonder.  Perhaps if I'd pushed myself harder while at Ozarks and while here at OU, I'd be in a better position?  Or maybe if I'd chosen a different field, one with some decent job prospects after graduation.  Part of me does wonder what would have happened if I'd put forth a little more effort in areas that didn't come as naturally as history and the humanities do.  Areas such as math, or science.  Would I have as many worries and concerns about my future if I'd gone into one of those fields?  Would schools be begging to have me attend instead of the other way around?  Admittedly, it's a fairly academic question, no pun intended.  I went into history, not meterology or biology or one of those other "-ologies."  I went into the humanties, knowing the job market wasn't great, knowing there were severe limitations placed on what I'd be able to do.  But I guess I also thought maybe that the rules didn't apply to me, that the world would make way for me to do whatever I damn well pleased, and that everyone and everything would cater to my whims.  It's a nice dream, you have to admit, but it's not very realistic at all.  It means there are many things I'm having to learn the hard way along the way, and that's never entirely pleasant.  But I also think that, despite the obstacles I face, and the apparent envy I have of my friends who are getting these nice offers, I'll be content with my chosen profession.  I'm not cut out for biology, or for meterology.  I can't do accounting, or marketing, or computer science.  I can write, I can think about things in a fairly abstract manner, and I can analyze documents and ideas in a fairly impressive fashion.  I can do humanities.  I can doodle a bit, and who knows?  There may be some monetary future in that, though probably not enough to sustain me or feed me or anything.  Perhaps enough to augment a real job with some fun cash, but that's about it.  I'm learning to be realistic.  I know I have some skills and abilities, and I know I have some limitations.  Now I'm trying to figure out how to work with what I have to get around what stands in my way.  Now I'm learning to make the most of the abilities I possess.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Cake, "Love You Madly"

       "Did Ye Get Healed?"   Life seems to be going pretty well.  I really have nothing to complain about except my own laziness, something which could be corrected by either my acting like an adult or the right woman coming along and whipping me into shape.  But yeah, things're good.  And yet...there's something hovering, just at the edge of conscious thought, something I cannot identify yet.  Something intangible that haunts my nights and gnaws at my days.  There's something  wrong , and I don't know what it is.  And that annoys me.  This afternoon, I learned the joys and glories and sheer addictiveness of website visitor statistic logs.  Looking at the logs for Dim Bulb, it appears that we average about 40-60 unique visitors per day.  That's actually more people than I know reading the comics, which makes me warm and happy in ways I can't speak about in polite company.  The logs also provide a list of site referals, those sites from which people found a link to us.  Most of them were as I suspected--links from  urlLink The Jaded  and from posts in various forums, from the two or three blogs that have linked us, etc.  But there were a few sites--webcomics, usually--that had linked us without me knowing.  I wish those who'd linked us would have told the Monkey or myself; there's a good chance we'd have linked them back.  But it's flattering to know that someone out there that we don't know likes our stuff.  Similarly, I was puttering around in the Keenspace Forum earlier today, and someone mentioned in a post their thoughts on Crooked Halo.  See, many months ago, back when Dim Bulb was just starting up on Keenspace, I'd posted in the forum asking for feedback on the comic.  I got a rather mediocre review from the person who looked at my comic, which sorta hurt, but not really, because they had decent critiques and I think helped me figure out what direction to take the comic.  Well, today, that same person happened to post in a thread I'd started to plug Dim Bulb, and what they said flattered me.  To quote: "I remember giving you a mediocre review, way back when... And I have to say, I was sadly mistaken - I read Crooked Halo on a regular basis, now. (I really need to update my links page... again...)"  That left me smiling vaguely for the rest of the day.    ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Lapdog, "Won't Let It"

       "She Don't Mind The Late Night Radio"   Well, yesterday I finally beat Battle Network 2.  Kicked that final boss's  ass , man!  Woo!  So now I'm working on finishing up Final Fantasy Tactics Advance.  I still have a bit left, and I've been playing for nearly 70 hours.  That's almost three total days' worth of engagements, job switching, inventory perusal, and learning kick ass new abilities.  A friend of mine told me a mutual friend was having trouble last night, so I sent the mutual friend a random, exceptionally sappy email.  She hasn't killed me yet with laser vision, so I can only assume she appreciated it rather than the alternative--wanting to see me dead in a gutter clutching an empty bottle of cheap whiskey.  Which isn't to say that isn't a distinct possibility sometime in the near future.  Assuming I can find some cheap whiskey that I can afford.  I talked with both parents (separately) last night, and my dad mentioned the OKC Metropolitan Library is having its annual book sale this Saturday.  He then said he was going to deposit $20 in my account so I could go buy books.  The books at these things cost about a quarter to fifty cents.  And he gave me $20.  I am gonna have so many books after this thing...  The only drawback is that I have to drive across town to be at the Fair Grounds at 9.30 am Saturday morning.  No sleeping in for Chuck!  Only half an hour of work left.  It's rather quiet--everyone suddenly left, all at about the same time.  So now the only people in here are employees.  We're all sitting in a row at the computers, typing away and not interacting.  It's sad and humorous in a weird sort of way.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: David Gray, "Faster, Sooner, Now"

       "My Heart Ain't Built To Stay"   And back to the grind with me, it is.  I've been here three hours and looked at one paper, eaten one bag of peanut butter M&Ms (with help), eaten one bacon cheeseburger (courtesy of my coworker Vicki, who just got one for me on a whim when she grabbed her own food before work...which ranks her as one of the coolest people I've ever worked with), drank one Pepsi, and finished one Terry Pratchett book ( Wee Free Men , which I was re-reading just for the hell of it).  I've also drawn one comic, listened to one CD (working on CD #2), and had my tail handed to me in Mega Man Battle Network 2 by the final boss twice.  And I wrote up commentary for all of the Troubled Times strips we've got archived so far.  So yeah, I've been sorta productive in the past four hours.  Work's pretty quiet tonight, but that's fine by me.  Oh, there's a new short story over at  urlLink Chirping Crickets .  It's a story I wrote a few years ago, but one I still rather like.  Go give it a read, and make sure to post comments.  I like feedback.  Lemme know what you liked, hated, were indifferent to.  Give me something to go on, people!  Next on things to do for the evening is compile a list of what storylines I've done in  urlLink Crooked Halo  and send said list to Adam so he can work on the dropdown menu for the main page.  He left me a nasty note via MSN Messenger Saturday asking me why I hadn't gotten on something he'd only mentioned in passing Monday or Tuesday.  I haven't had a chance to retaliate and let him know I was away from my computer for three days yet, and that I'll get to it when I'm damn-well good and ready.  Like, y'know, tonight.  And for a man who waited four months before getting on the archive project, I really don't think he has any room to pester me, y'know?  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Jars of Clay, "Show You Love"

       "Be Mine, Be Mine"   Well, another Valentine's Day has come and gone.  I spent the day with Wendy and her boyfriend, Tim, and the evening with Beth (she was supposed to go tool around town with Wendy, Tim, and myself earlier, but was feeling under the weather at the time, and thus couldn't...heh...a meterology major, under the weather...I crack me up).  My trip home (Thursday and Friday) was quite nice.  Thursday night, Wendy, Tim, and myself went to see the high school's dinner theatre,  Lend me a Tenor .  I was surprised at the quality of the performances--the show was stellar, and not just high school stellar, but of excellent quality period.  The two male leads in particular had lots of energy and did a phenomenal job.  Friday, I basically hung around home, got my hair cut, went to lunch with my grandmother, and did a whole lot of nothing.  I napped all afternoon, which was nice.  Today (well, yesterday now), I got up early, went to ye ol' doughnut shop, and then headed back to the city to hang out with Wendy again.  We went to the Omniplex, where I haven't been in nearly a decade.  The place is still really cool, and actually quite educational.  I don't know who developed that place, but they did an amazing job of making science interesting.  We also caught a couple of the shows they do--one at the Omnidome I-Max theatre about the Lewis and Clark expedition, and then a planetarium show about the winter sky that was nifty (except the girl narrating had this annoying voice...very mechanical, and poor rhythm.  She was talking in such a way that you knew she was trying to get out every sentence in exactly one breath, regardless of the length of the sentence).  Then we went to the Myriad Botanical Gardens, which were very neat, very tropical (thus hot and humid--it was like an Oklahoma summer in the middle of February), and just all-around spiffy.  After that, we attempted to visit both the state capitol and the governor's mansion, but both were closed to the public today.  Instead, I showed Wendy and Tim my humble abode in the Norman ghetto.  Wendy kept insisting I needed a cat, and I kept insisting I liked my furniture the way it was and my cables not chewed through.  Then she and Tim headed out to go do the couple's thing for Valentine's Day, and I relaxed, checked email, etc.  By chance, I ended up conversing with Beth via IM, and we decided (since she was feeling better after sleeping some) to have a movie night.  We ended up getting three movies (they were 3 for $9.99 at Blockbuster): Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (which I hadn't actually seen all the way through before), Underworld (Matrix with crappy werewolf special effects), and Pitch Black (fun popcorn sci-fi).  I rolled in from her place and movies about half an hour ago, actually.  So yeah, my Valentine's Day was pretty good.  So good, in fact, that it never bothered me once that I'm single.  It never felt weird, or depressing, or bitter, or anything like that.  It was just a good day.  I've been single on Valentine's Day for the past seven years, and this is the first one in that span of time that's gone by without me moping.  I don't know if this means I was just too busy to ever think about it, or that I'm actually okay with being single now.  I think it has more to do with the latter than the former, as I did spend a significant part of the day with Wendy and her boy, and as Wendy herself noted Thursday night, she was the walking embodiment of PDA.  And tomorrow it's back to the grind.  Eight hours of work--ugh.  Oh well--it's a significant amount of my paycheck, so I won't complain.  Just need to find a new book to read, since I finished  The Hobbit  Friday night.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: David Gray, "Birds Without Wings"

       "Good Lovers And Friends I Still Can Recall"   Hardship breaks my heart.  And not even my own hardship--hell, the most I usually have to suffer through for my own sake is that such or another girl told me she wanted to be my friend rather than my girlfriend, or that I don't have enough ready cash to purchase the CD I kinda sorta want.  I don't go hungry, I have a roof over my head and a vehicle that works well, I have friends and family who love me dearly, and I don't have much suffering in my life, truth be told.  Most of my problems are brought on by my own stupidity.  So it hurts me instead when my friends are in pain, not least because I don't always know what to do about it.  I don't have emotional problems (though my mother suspected I did when I was in high school...I think she finally figured out that was just teenage angst and anxiety and pressure over college choice), I don't have people stabbing me in the back (that I'm aware of), I don't have any sort of life-threatening physical condition (I'm overweight, but not dangerously so, and I'm working on that, after all).  Some of my friends do.  One is dealing with figuring out that friends are people who stay with you regardless of the problems, who encourage you to get the help you actually need.  Another is trying to find out who they are, many years after they thought they knew.  Some are dealing with things I can't even begin to understand, or even with things I can understand but on such a level that I cannot even imagine trying to cope with it.  Maybe a couple of those friends are reading this, maybe they're not.  That really doesn't matter.  What matters is that they are my friends and I love them dearly, and will do anything within my power to help them in any way I can.  Admittedly, most of what I'm capable of doing is simply listening and talking.  I've had friends cry on my shoulder; I've cried on the shoulders of my friends, usually over things that seemed vital at the time and now seem almost trivial and sophomoric.  I've been the healer and the healed, the patient and the doctor.  I've tried my hand at being an amateur psychologist, and only hope I've done more good than harm.  I'm not, to use a term I've picked up from Ev, an alpha.  I'm not a leader, or a charismatic person who can inspire others to follow me into the very jaws of hell or anything like that.  The most I inspire in people is maybe a chuckle or a groan, or a shaking of the head on bad days.  A rolling of the eyes, perhaps.  I don't think people take their lead from my example, and I'm not conceited enough to think anyone necessarily should (which isn't to say that people who do set a standard for others to follow are conceited...just that it'd be conceited for me to assume that I'm one of those people).  I don't even necessarily know why I'm saying all this, or where it will go...these entries always turn out rather stream of consciousness, expressing whatever's on my mind at the time.  Currently, said mind is awash with dozens of thoughts, and I feel guilty for thinking some of them.  Part of me is thinking of the fun I'll have this weekend seeing Wendy and her new boy, and hanging out with them and introducing them to Beth (and then watching as Beth and Wendy gang up on me and destroy what little manliness I have remaining, which is currently wrapped around me in tatters and rags like a cloak of dignity or office).  I'm thinking of the fact that they finally announced that the Star Wars trilogy (not the prequels) will be released on DVD in September, though I'm sure Greedo will still shoot first.  But most of all, I'm thinking of my friends.  I'm thinking that there is very little I would not do for them.  There are some friends I could probably be convinced to commit a crime for.  I was reading Ev's blog earlier, and he mentioned something about some of the people he knew: how they were willing to be active politically, to effect socio-political change, but were unwilling to act to prohibit a social predator from harming people emotionally because they were afraid of losing the benefits of knowing the person.  In a simple twist of fate, to borrow a phrase from Dylan, I'm pretty much the complete opposite--you can hardly convince me to do anything to be politically active.  I'll vote, but it won't go far beyond that.  I don't care about politics.  I don't think that's where I can effect any sort of major change.  But I'll be damned before I'll let someone harm one of my friends.  I don't care what the price may be.  I'll suffer ostracism, I'll deal with public humiliation or whatever.  I'll do what it takes, whatever's in my power, to defend the honor of my friends.  I was having a conversation with Beth last night along those lines, actually.  She'd mentioned something about her brother once standing up to the high school football team when she was just a freshman in high school (which, since she started a year early and skipped a grade, meant she was about 12 or 13).  Being the dork that I am, I piped up, "I'd defend your honor."  I sat back and thought about it for a minute, and realized I really would.  I would actually get in a physical fight to protect her, and I don't just mean protect her physically.  And that just made me think of the lengths I'd go to to protect those even dearer to me.  It's strange how strangers slip through quietly, and suddenly they're friends.  How people we hardly know happen to be around for a while, and suddenly we seem to know all about them.  There's a beauty and a simplicity to that which I'm just now noticing, but I'm glad I'm having the opportunity to.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Jewel, "You were meant for Me"

       "Well, It Was 40 Years Ago Today..."   ...the Beatles came to the USA...  Yes indeed, fourty years ago today, the Beatles arrived in America, on the Ed Sullivan Show, and turned music upside down.  Don't argue with me about this, I'm right.  No, they did not invent rock and roll.  No, they didn't have as many #1s as Elvis, perhaps.  But they achieved heights in music that have still not been reached by any other band.  Fourty years after Beatlemania began, after four lads from the working class industrial town of Liverpool crossed the big pond, they are still one of the most well-known and easily-recognized bands in the world.  A collection of their number one songs--songs which most everyone already had--still went multi-platinum a few years ago.  More than half the nation witnessed their first appearance on Ed Sullivan.  The Beatles are, arguably, the biggest band in rock and roll history.  No other band is surrounded in such myth as they.  They inspired Dylan (and were in turn inspired by him), they opened the way for bands like the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, and countless others, and changed the way rock and roll worked.  They wrote their own material, and ignored the plastic pop-rock of few years preceeding their explosion.  Every one of their albums--with the exception of the Yellow Submarine Soundtrack, which really wasn't even a full-fledged album--is a classic.  Most of them are downright essential to any rock and roll fan's music collection.  I really can't say anything about them that hasn't been said before.  I cannot do the body of their musical work any justice by reciting an endless litany of their biggest hits.  But I still want to say that they have been and will continue to be my favorite band ever.  No other will ever compare, not even the Yeti.  There's just no way any group of mortals could ever compare with these gods of music.  I'm sad that George and John are dead.  It leaves this empty spot in music that shouldn't be there.  But their memory lives on in their music, and the legacy they built holds true.  It's cliche, but I still think the Beatles themselves summed it up best:  "And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make."  No truer words have ever been committed to music.  No truer sentiment exists.  The Beatles are our social consciousness, expressing the emotion and sheer joy of life that we all look for.  They are our bards, even so long after they're gone.  Go on, listen to a Beatles song today.  Do it for yourself, and for them.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Beatles, "Yesterday"

       "Losers: The Soundtrack"   With the immanent day that single people dread upon us, I thought it might be appropriate to share a selection of songs I put together a few years ago when I was bitter.  I call it  Losers: The Soundtrack , and I think if you look closely, you'll see a bit of a theme.  1.  Soul Coughing--The Idiot Kings 2.  Beck--Loser 3.  Cake--Friend is a Four Letter Word 4.  Ben Folds Five--Song for the Dumped 5.  The Police--So Lonely 6.  Seven Mary Three--Cumbersome 7.  Green Day--Nice Guys Finish Last 8.  Three Doors Down--Loser 9.  Bob Dylan--Positively 4th Street 10.  The Beatles--I'm a Loser 11.  Smashmouth--Why Can't We Be Friends 12.  Sting--She's too Good for Me 13.  Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers--Even the Losers 14.  Reel Big Fish--She has a Girlfriend Now 15.  Semisonic--Gone to the Movies 16.  Radiohead--Creep 17.  Moxy Fruvous--Hate Letter 18.  Five Iron Frenzy--Pre-Ex-Girlfriend 19.  The Police--Can't Stand Losing You 20.  Edwin McCain--Sign on the Door 21.  Santana--Winning  The thing about a lot of these songs is that they're ironic, or at the very least tongue in cheek.  Some of them--such as the Semisonic tune, the Edwin McCain tune, and the Bob Dylan one--are on there mostly for the thematic content, even if the titles aren't quite so close.  The Soul Coughing tune is on there mostly because it has a good groove and fits in theory, because I'm usually the king of morons when it comes to asking girls out.  Plus, it just feels right as the opener.  The Smashmouth song actually has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the songs thematically, as it's a plea for interracial harmony.  But as Adam pointed out when I first put this set of songs together, it takes on a whole new meaning in this context.  As for the Santana tune...well, I've always thought things should end with hope.  And I really couldn't resist juxtaposing "Winning" with all the losing.  And it ends the album on an upbeat note, which I do think is important.  A second volume of this has been in the works for a couple of years now.  I've got enough songs to make it, I just don't happen to like all the songs as much.  There are several that will definitely be on there, but a bunch of the songs I found were pop-punk/emo crap that was way too whiney.  This isn't about being whiney--this is about poking fun at my situation in life, about laughing at it and moving on.  This is about having fun.  Anyway, if you feel so inclined, try to assemble those songs.  It's a fun little trip.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Santana, "Winning"

       "Run For Your Life"   Well, I survived the run yesterday morning up in Ponca City.  I didn't have to stop and walk, and I didn't puke afterwards.  Finished in just a shade over 35 minutes, which isn't too bad when you consider it was early in the morning and about 10 degrees outside.  Then last night was the 1964 concert.  A splendid time was guaranteed for all, though the audience wasn't as energetic as previous 1964 concerts I've attended.  Ah well--the music was still good.  It's fun when you can actually sing along with every single song (Beth also gave me a funny look a couple of times when I did a little mouth riff along with George's guitar solo.  Then she'd say, "You really like this song, don't you?"  To which I'd reply, "I like 'em all!").  I think even Beth, who's not really much of a Beatles fan (though she did know a couple of the songs), enjoyed herself.  She was smiling quite often and sang along on the songs she did know, at least, so I can only assume that means she had a good time.  Busy week ahead of me.  I need to get some stuff done on research papers, clean the apartment (I think FEMA said something the other day about declaring it a disaster area and getting me federal relief), and on Thursday head to Shawnee to hang out with Wendy.  I'll probably drag her and her boy back to Norman on Friday or Saturday (whichever they're free during), and make them meet my friends here (i.e., Beth).  I'm looking forward to getting to see Wendy; it's been many, many months since our last time together (which was back in early July, if memory serves).  Oh, and at some point this week, I still need to do the Crooked Halo archives.  Weee.  Correction: the Phil Collins album was not called  In the Air Tonight , but rather  Face Value .  Those responsible for this error have been sacked and shot out of a cannon.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Beatles, "She Loves You (yeah, yeah, yeah)"

       "Hey Now, You're An All Star"   I got an interesting email today.  It was from  urlLink Keenspace All Stars , a website devoted to "acknowledging the best of Keenspace," to quote the site.  Interestingly enough, Crooked Halo was one of the comics on their list for the month.  I have no idea who nominated or voted for me, but I'm very, very honored.  I'm in the company of such Keenspacers as  urlLink Count Your Sheep ,  urlLink The Jaded ,  urlLink Mixed Myth ,  urlLink Fallen Angel Used Books , and  urlLink Reasoned Cognition .  Anyway, for those of you reading this (you probably also read the comic, I'm assuming), thanks for reading Halo, and I'll try to maintain a level of quality that deserves such recognition.  In other news, I got an old Phil Collins album on CD today.  It's  No Jacket Required , which was one of my favorite tapes when I was younger.  The album's chock-full of great tunes that I know by heart and still remembered, even though I haven't heard most of the songs in years and years.  I remember when that tape was part of my usual musical regimine.  The other tapes were Collins'  Face Value  (another great album), Tom Petty's  Full Moon Fever ,  Into the Great Wide Open , and  Damn the Torpedoes , Led Zeppelin's  ZOSO  ( Led Zeppelin IV , the one that had weird symbols for the title), the two Traveling Wilburys albums, and the Black Crowes'  Shake Your Money Maker .  These were the albums that I constantly listened to until I got a CD player and CDs.  When I wasn't listening to those tapes, I was in the living room listening to dad's records.  He had lots of great stuff--Beatles albums, the Eagles, Electric Light Orchestra, solo stuff from the former Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, and others that I can't even begin to remember without going back in and looking at them.  Granted, I mostly just listened to the Beatles records...the number of times I sat there with  Help!  or  Sgt. Pepper's  filling the headphones and my ears are too many to count.    So all in all, it's been a good day.  My run today was good--it took me about half an hour to run around my neighborhood and then around campus, so that's roughly 3 miles or so (because that's about how long it should take me to run three miles, even if I'm running a 10 minute mile, which I think I'm moving faster than that).  Also took Ev up to Circuit City in OKC to exchange a DVD player that didn't work, and that worked out well for him (they gave him store credit, which was better than what I thought would happen--I figured they wouldn't even let him exchange it period).  All told, life is pretty good, and could be much, much worse.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Phil Collins, "Inside Out" (it was always my favorite song on the album)

       "Be Mine, Be Mine"   So I went to check my mail this afternoon, and found a package in my mailbox.  This came as something of a surprise, as I haven't ordered anything of late and was unaware of anyone planning to send me a package.  Yet there were my name and address on the package, clear and discernable.  I took the package inside and opened it, and found an old Valentines' box.  The box itself looked to be about 15 or 20 years old, but again my name was written on it.  No clearer as to why I had this package than I was before, I opened the box.  The contents of the box turned out to be Valentines from various members of my church.  Seems they'd decided to send these little packages full of Valentines and candy to all the church members in college.  It made me smile and was very sweet of them, and made my afternoon very nifty.  And since life can't let me go with positive points, it had to hit me with something annoying.  Mom got my bill from the university today, and I'm only enrolled for 8 hours, not 9.  Which is stupid, because the class I should be enrolled in 4 hours in is currently only set at 3 hours.  I know I changed it to four, though--I still have the email the computer system automatically generated when I changed my hours.  So tomorrow I get to pester the registrar's office and get them to fix it so I'm enrolled like I ought to be.  It's not going to be difficult to get done, just tedious and time consuming.  It's a nuisance more than anything else.  In other news, I've been playing Final Fantasy Tactics Advance for almost 70 hours now, and I've just now finished half of the possible missions.  I'd like to beat all 300 missions, but I don't know if I'll have the patience for that.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Van Morrison, "Queen of the Slipstream"

       "Will I See You Give More Than I Can Take, Will I Only Harvest Some?"   Today's been good if relatively uneventful.  I finally got a decent night's sleep last night, after spending four hours driving home and then eight hours at work (which was also, thankfully, uneventful).  Then I slept for like 10 or 11 hours, and woke feeling very refreshed.  I'm still a bit tired, but that's okay, because I'll get another good night's sleep tonight.  Anyway, all I've done today were the dishes, run, and watch The Dark Crystal with Ev.  I'd forgotten just how good the Dark Crystal was, especially considering it's all done with puppets.  Jim Henson was a genius, and his work was always top notch.  The Dark Crystal is probably one of the best fantasy films I've ever seen.  I'd almost rank it up there with LOTR and the Princess Bride.  My run was actually pleasantly good.  I ran far--once around the neighborhood and then around the entire campus, which is quite a bit further than I usually run on a given day.  I really think that if the races my dad keeps signing us up for were in the late afternoon, I'd kick ass.  Does make me wonder, though, why all of these races seem to be in the winter, early in the morning, and around  lakes .  "How uncomfortable can we make these races?" one race promoter asked another.  Replied his companion, "Make it early, cold, and in a place where the wind can sythe through their clothes and freeze them to their very core."  In short, the folks who come up with these things are evil and didn't have me in mind when they were planning...the bastards.  Class and work tomorrow.  Ev says that the Oklahoma Primary is also tomorrow, but I'd have to drive all the way to Shawnee to do that.  I don't really know much about any of the Democratic candidates (I'm registered Democrat), and don't feel that I'd be making any sort of educated contribution to the proceedings.  I'd prefer to actually know a bit about what they're all campaigning for and all that, but since I'm not likely to discover this between now and tomorrow morning, I'm going to exercise my sense of civic duty and not vote with absolutely no idea about the person I'm voting for.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Sting, "Heavy Cloud No Rain"

       "It's Too Late To Stop Now"   Well, I made it to Ozarks and back in one piece, despite my best efforts to fall asleep at the wheel several times there and back.  I think next time, I'm going to try to get more than four hours of sleep before I get on the road.  Though I wonder when the next time I go to Ozarks will be.  Things have been odd since I graduated.  During the first several trips, it felt as though I'd never left.  I arrived, I settled back in to my position within the group and went with the flow of things.  But ever since about graduation last year, it's been...different.  Each visit makes Clarksville feel more and more alien, more distanced from me by time and experience.  I'm not saying I'm bigger or better than the people at Ozarks...far from it, in many cases.  Rather, my path has diverged now, and is meandering in a different direction.  Granted, I'm not exactly sure what direction it is yet, but I feel more like an outsider with each visit.  It doesn't help that people keep leaving.  In July, we said goodbye to Chris and JP, who headed to Seattle.  James soon left for Fayetteville.  Heather left in December.  There are about four or five people still at Ozarks for whom I care deeply enough to want to visit, and one of them's in France right now.  I saw the others over the weekend.  But for perhaps the first time since I gradutated a year and a half ago, Ozarks didn't feel like home.  I've been feeling increasingly like an outsider, but it was always negligible, subtle; this time, it hit me full-force, and it saddened me.  I know we always have to move on and go our own way.  I just wanted my way to parallel my nearest and dearest for a bit longer.  Every trip back has always been suffused with a slightly wistful, bittersweet tinge, but this time, it was almost overwhelming.  Maybe it's the fact that three more of the people I visit are graduating in May.  Maybe it's a rememberance of things I should have said, and now may not have the chance to say.  Maybe I'm just ridiculously nostalgic.  Whatever the cause, I'm rather depressed now, and it feels as though I've reached the penultimate chapter in my relationship with Ozarks.  I'll probably only go there another time or two between now and when Clif graduates, if I even get to attend his graduation.  I don't know where I'll be this time next year, or even where I'll be this summer.  The future is so uncertain, except that I know that Ozarks is rapidly becoming a part of my past, not a part of my present.  I don't necessarily want this--like I said, there are still people I care about deeply there and want to see--but I'm not sure how I'll be able to actually see them.  I'm not really articulating these thoughts very well.  There are people and things on my mind that I can't really express, proving yet again how form forces certain restraints upon content.  Few things are certain right now, except that I'm desperately missing my friends, and it feels like I've suddenly lost a home.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Van Morrison, "Caravan (Live)"

       "Only You Know And I Know"   Well, I had a pretty good birthday yesterday.  Clif called me at 5.30 am from France to wish me a happy birthday, after which I proceeded to sleep for the next six and a half hours.  Got up, made an effort to clean the apartment, and the folks came over around 6.00 pm and took Beth, Jessica, Dominic, and myself out to dinner.  The folks left, and we sat up and played MarioKart until after 1.00 am.  Then I sat and chatted with Miss Webster for a couple of hours, hit the sack, and got up at noon today and came to work at 2.00.  So yeah, not exceptionally exciting or exceptional, but a fun evening full of good conversation, good friends, and things of that nature.  Also, my folks got me some cool stuff--a new flat-panel LCD computer monitor and the X-Men DVD collection (both movies and extra goodies...good stuff).  The monitor hasn't arrived yet, but I got an IOU in my birthday card.  Jess and Dom got me a kick-ass t-shirt which reads, "I play air guitar in an air band."  Very funny stuff.  Work has gone by relatively quickly tonight.  We haven't been tremendously busy, which I don't really mind, to be honest.  I got some drawing done, won an eBay auction (for Soul Calibur II--$28, which is about half what you'd pay in the stores), and played some Gameboy.  Anyway, had lots of friends and family send me well-wishes yesterday, and that was very nice indeed.  My 24th birthday went very well, even if it's one of those you really don't think about a whole lot.  It's not like turning 16, or 18, or 21, or 30 or anything like that.  It's just another birthday, another mile marker to show you the progress you've made in life.  But at least it feels like I've made some progress.  I could reflect back upon the previous year and yammer on and on about it, but I'm not sure there's a need to.  It's been a good year, with ups and downs, but looking back upon things from the vantage point of another year down the road, I like where I am compared to last year.  I have some new friends, I have my old friends, I'm happy with who I am, and things seem to be going well for me.  Here's to another 24, eh?  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Beatles, "Birthday"

       "So They Say It's Your Birthday..."   Very, very Happy Birthday to you, m'dear. In honor of this glorious occasion, I've searched and searched for pants and cake for you. However, instead of pants, I found this (complete with link, if you click on the picture)....   urlLink     Didn't have quite so much luck finding a cake, but it prob'ly wouldn't taste the same, anyway (what with the monitor getting in the way, and all).   So, you're old today, huh? Not quite as old as the Monkey and Bob, but still getting pretty close. Borderline "no longer a young whippersnapper." One of these days, we'll be able to call you an old geezer, too (meaning it only in the best of ways, of course). Anywho, I hope this day is everything you dreamed it would be and more. You truly are one of the most wonderful people I have ever known and deserve only the best. Happy Birthday, hon.   ~Manda

       "We Didn't Start The Fire"   Friday was an eventful day, to say the least.  Had a conference with my advisor about my Master's Thesis.  He had some very constructive things to say about it; first and foremost that it needs a lot of work.  But at least he told me the sort of work it needs, gave me some really good stuff to look at and for, and he said that it was still workable.  Granted, I'll probably be graduating in the summer instead of May, but that's not a big deal because it doesn't interfere with me attending Ohio State in the Fall (assuming, of course, that they accept me.  Still haven't heard yet).  Spent the evening hanging out with Ev, watching anime and chatting about damn-near everything under the sun.  It seems as though I actually had some profound things to say this evening, and I think I may've helped Ev out on a couple of sticky points he's been having trouble dealing with.  Also got a call from James, Heather, and Alison (aka Bob) a little after midnight, wishing me a happy birthday (I'm now 24 and all old 'n' stuff).  It was good hearing from them, and I was especially happy to hear from James about upcoming Terry Pratchett novels (huzzah!  Pratchett's next is another Granny Weatherwax novel).  The one downside to the call (other than the fact that I couldn't talk for a real long time) was that it made me suddenly miss Ozarks and a couple of people specifically a lot more than I have in months.  Mostly, it made me miss Heather and Amanda Erisman.  I don't really know how much detail I want to go into about this, especially since it's been a long day, I don't know how much I'll say if I get real deep into it, and I don't know how much private stuff I really want to share (though I'm 99% sure neither of them reads this thing).  But those two are probably two of my absolute closest friends ever, and I hardly ever get to talk with them.  Though really, if I were being honest, I don't miss talking with them the most.  I miss their presence the most.  I miss just being around them, hanging around and not doing anything important or profound.  Those two understand me better in a lot of ways than I understand myself.  They're two very different people.  Heather is the sister I never had, and we have a rapport that I think some married couples would envy.  She's a bit goofy, but a wonderfully warm and caring soul.  We helped each other survive a lot of crap at Ozarks.  Heather was my comforter, my ward, and my confidant.  There is still very little--if anything--that I wouldn't tell her if she asked.  Amanda is stubborn.  That really tells you almost everything you need to know, and probably tells you why she and I are good friends.  I react to stubbornness by being more stubborn myself, and she does the same.  It's like two brick walls slamming into each other again and again.  She's loud, brash, and likes to laugh at me when I do something stupid (which, around her, is pretty much all the time).  But she's also one of the most generous people I've ever met, and willing to do anything and everything for those she cares about.  And her smile lights up the whole room.  You want to be a better person, just so you can see her smile again.  Her laughter is infectious and genuine, something you don't encounter much anymore.  There were days that the only reason I made it through to the next one was that I wanted to see her smile again.  Heather and Amanda are also two of the very few people who have actually seen me cry.  It doesn't happen very often, and I'm usually rather embarrassed when it does occur.  Like I said, they both know more about me than I do.  They get to see the ridiculously animated and perhaps even charming Chuck, but they also get to see the mopey, depressed, barely willing to keep trying Chuck.  Admittedly, a lot of other people have seen the latter as well (Chris and JP especially, having lived with me for three years), but Heather and Amanda always got it in concentrated doses when I couldn't stand to keep it inside anymore.  I love them both dearly.  I miss them both dearly.  I wish they were closer.  I wish I could still just walk down the hall and visit.  I'm probably going to Ozarks for Alumni Weekend.  They'll both be there.  Amanda Webster will be there, as will Bob, the Noise Monkey, and a handful of others I still care about at that school.  I look forward to the weekend; it may be one of my last there with them.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Dire Straits, "On Every Street"

       "Your Eyes Are Burning Holes Through Me"   It's been a good day.  Slept in pretty late after staying up late last night to watch the Concert for George (mom taped it off PBS for me a couple of weeks ago) and Mel Brooks'  History of the World, Part I  (ditto).  Both worthwhile, though the Brooks movie had commercials (curses upon AMC for putting in commercials and editting for content!).  I noticed some interesting things about the Concert for George, though.  First of all, Dhani, George's son, looks disturbingly similar to his old man.  It's uncanny.  Second, Tom Petty and Eric Clapton look really freakin' old now.  They really haven't taken care of themselves very well (the same can be said for Neil Young, who was on Conan last week.  He looks downright ancient, as does Petty).  I guess some folks age gracefully, and some do not.  Anyway, went running with Beth this afternoon.  Also helped her get some new running shoes (before we went running, actually).  Running didn't go quite as well as we'd hoped, but she was breaking in new shoes and running for the first time in almost a week (and on concrete for the first time in almost a year).  Beth also happened to doodle a little picture of Earl for me while she was sitting bored in class one day.  That'll be posted as soon as I can figure out how to add stuff to the Dim Bulb Gallery.  I still find it amusing that so many people like Earl.  He was only ever supposed to be a minor character in the comic, but he's become rather prominent.  Hell, I'm just finishing up a major storyline that features him.  Also found  urlLink this  in the school paper yesterday.  Who's that in the front row with an exclamation mark on his t-shirt?  That's right, it's Simon.  The guy who does the comics on Monday wanted to do a group portrait sort of thing of the main characters of each day.  He had to use political symbols for a couple of them because those two only ever do political cartoons (and not very funny ones at that).  Only the Monday guy and myself actually make comics that're worthwhile (he had one about the deterioration of peoples' spelling and grammar abilities a month or so ago that had me rolling and wishing I'd drawn it).  Anyway, work looks like it'll be slow tonight.  Maybe I can catch up on all the guestcomics I've been promising people I'd do for a few weeks.  Hey, I can't help it--I had to write a Master's Thesis.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Soul Coughing, "16 Horses"

       "Enough A Cynic To Believe"   Well, I'm back in Norman again.  I would've waited until tomorrow morning to come home, except for two things:  (1) I didn't want to have to wake up early tomorrow and drive back to Norman from Shawnee.  I'd rather sleep until noon.  (2) Got something in the mail in Shawnee from Ohio State.  It was a notice that they'd received my FAFSA and a form that they wanted me to fill out that was about a Graduate Tuition Fee Waiver.  Now, that second one got me thinking.  I hadn't received anything like this from either Wisconsin or Washington U.  I know I sent my FAFSA information to all three schools--I filled it out online, so they should have received it within a couple of days of its completetion way back in like January.  Why didn't I receive such notification from Wisconsin or Washington U, then?  Besides, the second page in the letter, the thing about Graduate Tuition Fee Waiver...that got me thinking.  It got me thinking maybe I've been accepted to Ohio State.  Now, they'd send the FAFSA notification thing to Shawnee because that's still my permanent address.  But my Norman address is the one I put on all my applications and such, so an acceptance letter would show up here.  With this in mind, I packed up and was out the door a scant half hour after returning to Shawnee from my grandparents' place.  I don't think I spent 48 hours at home this week.  Ah well.  Anyway, long story short, there was nothing in my mailbox from Ohio State, so the waiting continues.  However, I'm a lot more confident about Ohio State now.  It also kinda relates back to something my mom mentioned in the car on the way to Ponca City Thursday.  She said something about how she'd been praying about me and graduate school and the like the other night, and suddenly she got this feeling of overwhelming peace about the whole situation.  She said she had this sense that it was all going to work out exactly as it should, that I'd be accepted and that I'd be going to Ohio State in the fall.  Evidence seems to be pointing in that direction at the moment, and I certainly hope she's right.  Oddly enough, when she mentioned that to me, I'd felt a bit more peaceful about it all.  My mom is something of a worrier, as all good mothers are to an extent.  She's concerned about damn-near everything, always worried about whether or not we've done everything we need to do, whether or not we're adequately prepared for every contengency...I swear, she's taken the Boy Scout motto of "Be Prepared" to its hyperlogical extension.  I know that the graduate school question has been preying on my mind of late, and I know it's been bothering her just as much.  To hear her suddenly not be worried about it...it took a heavy weight off my mind, let me tell you.  Perhaps more than anything this week, that really was a relief.  Just got done watching the movie  Masked and Anonymous , which stars Bob Dylan, John Goodman, Luke Wilson, and Jeff Bridges.  I'm still not sure what to make of the film.  It's very surreal.  Dylan's character was almost straight out of one of his songs, an aging cynic who doesn't really know what to expect next from the world except more trouble.  It was interesting, at least, and some of the reinterpretations of old Dylan tunes (both by Dylan himself and by various other artists...and not always in English) were intriguing.  I'm glad I picked it up, but it'll take a couple more viewings before it makes any sense, I think.  Oh, and just one more week until I turn 24.  Send well wishes and cash gifts if'n you're so inclined.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Bob Dylan, "Cold Irons Bound"

       "I'm Not The One Who's So Far Away"   Just got done with the first draft of the Master's Thesis.  Emailed it to all my committee and to my father for proofreading and comments.  Part of me is so very, very glad to be done with this, and another part of me fears that I'm going to get it back and they're going to say, "God, that was awful.  We're not letting you graduate."  Sure, the latter seems a little unrealistic, but when you remember that this really sorta dictates my future (even more than getting in to the next grad school), it's kind of a heavy thing.  Eesh.  Anyway, gotta make Friday's comic (already made Wednesday's), do some cleaning up around here so it's not such a pit when I return (I don't want moldy dishes), and pack up.  I can do all that in two hours, right?  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Godsmack, "Voodoo" (don't even ask me why)

       "Don't Know If I Saw You If I'd Kiss You Or Kill You"   Today was a productive day.  Got lots done on the Thesis, so I should have the rough draft done by tomorrow without too much of a problem.  Also went for a run today.  It wasn't pretty.  I haven't run on concrete in almost three weeks (I've run during that time, though not much and most of those times were on the indoor track).  Lord, did it hurt.  My shins, my ankles, my knees, my thighs...I could hardly move.  I managed just over a mile before my legs gave out.  I'm going to take running shoes and clothes with me when I go home tomorrow and try to run every day I'm home, so we'll see how that goes.  Maybe with dad around, I can get myself going again.  If I can just get used to the concrete again, I'll be fine, honest.  Had dinner with Jessica and Dominic, then they came over and we just sorta hung out for awhile.  It was nice to just relax, not have to think about anything, and play some videogames with Dom while Jess organized a list of songs for me to download for them for their wedding in early June.  After Jess and Dom left, I worked a little more on the Thesis, did a quick little pic for Ping, and went to Wal-Mart to get some Starburst Jelly Beans, which are like my Achilles Heel, I swear.  See, that's the thing I really hate about Easter--the candy.  I both love it and loathe it.  On the one hand, if I want jelly beans or Cadburry Creme Eggs or whatnot, they're only a short drive away.  On the other hand, if I want jelly beans or Cadburry Creme Eggs or whatnot, they're only a short drive away.  It's a terrible double-edged sword.  I have a tough enough time with self control at the best of times, but when so much great candy is so readily available, it's hard to resist temptation.  So I didn't.  I bought some jelly beans.  Lord, are they good.  And when Easter's over, and they all go on sale...dear God, I'm done for.  Doesn't matter if I've given up soda pop, it seems I'm taking in all those calories anyway on some days.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Barenaked Ladies, "Thanks that was fun"

       "What Does She Get For All The Love She Gave You?"   Damn, things are finally moving on the Master's Thesis.  I found a nifty source in the library today that's solving a lot of my problems.  Nothin' like spending an hour and a half sitting in front of the microfilm reader machine and printing out a 160 page primary source document to make a man feel alive and $10 poorer.  Anyway, I'm finally in my writing groove.  Document explication is the thing I do very, very well, and now I have a nifty document to pick apart for page after glorious page.  Then I'll do it with some other documents I have, because that's just sorta how these kinds of papers run.  So it looks like I probably won't be going home until Tuesday, which is fine by me.  Means I'll probably try to hang out with Jessica and Dominic tomorrow evening for a while, since I really haven't seen any people (except for library employees or Wal-Mart employees, who don't really count...unless they're Wal-Mart employees in Clarksville, in which case they count doubly so as people, since both Amandas and a couple of other people I know happen to make that a rather more entertaining Wal-Mart than either of the ones in Norman) since Friday around noon.  Anyway, I'm not fairly confident in this silly thing again, which is a damn sight better than I felt about it, say, yesterday, or Friday, or Thursday, or Wednesday, or Tuesday, or Monday, or last Sunday...well, you get the idea.  This was not a good week, for the most part, but I'm past it now, and things can only get better now, right?  To quote Terry Pratchett, "Every day, in every way, we are getting better and better."  While I'm home, I'll be celebrating my birthday.  That'll be fun.  Means we'll also get to celebrate my grandfather's birthday (it's on the 25th, two days before mine).  For as long as I can remember, we've been going to my grandparents' place for a few days on Spring Break, and while there, we do the joint birthday celebration.  It means we'll get fed really well and we'll have cake.  Mmm, cake...  Of course, I'm gonna have to fight the urge to have a Coke while at the grandparents' place.  Temptation seems to be stronger up there than at home (where we have no soda pop) or here (where I have no money to purchase soda pop).  I think it has something to do with the tendency to spoil grandkids that grandmothers have.  Ah well.  On an unrelated note, Adam  urlLink put together  based on a comic I did on Friday.  Needless to say, I want one.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Old '97s, "Four Leaf Clover"

       "Renegade Folk Hero"   Ugh, I'm having a terrible time writing this damn thesis.  I don't know why this particular paper is so difficult.  Probably because of the dearth of primary sources I've been able to track down.  At least, useful primary sources.  And the time period seems so muddled...a guy whom I know for a fact is a Non-Juror (meaning he wasn't a part of William and Mary's church and that he would be against them) wrote something that seems to defend William.  At least, people think he wrote it.  They're not sure.  They at least know he wrote something with a similar title.  But I'm confused as all hell.  I really wish I had a week to just sit in the library and find stuff.  It'd help immensely.  Of course, there's a line of thougt that suggests I should have done all that months ago, and I should have already known what sources would work and wouldn't before I sat down to start writing earlier this week.  God, I'm such an idiot sometimes.  Why I've put this off so much, I can't even begin to imagine.  Anyway, I'm just writing here to try to get my hands warmed up and get me in the writing mood.  The thesis needs a lot of work and a lot more material, not to mention some structural work.  But I think I know what I need to do, and I think I can get it done.  I hope.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: George Harrison, "All those years ago"

       "Delusions Of Grandeur"   Just got an email from Clyde.  He apparently received his care package from home today, which contained a copy of the Cross-Eyed Yeti CD.  Apparently that CD is also a big hit with all the folks he knows in France.  That's right--we're goin' international, baby!  Of course, having heard some of the stuff that's popular in France, I can see why they'd be so ready to accept the Yeti.  Something so stripped down and basic, so fresh and unaffected...it's like the antithesis to the crap they've got available over there (the Scissor Sisters cover of "Comfortably Numb" still makes me hurt).  As Clyde suggested, perhaps my trouble getting into a grad school is just God's way of saying perhaps it's time for me to consider my music career (I can already hear James screaming).  Maybe the world is ready for the Yeti.  Clif put it best--"Delusion of Grandeur?  Maybe.  But that's what the Yeti's all about."  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Cross-Eyed Yeti, "Ode to Cock Rock"

       "What's Wrong With This Picture?"   It's early.  I'm at work.  People in Madrid are blowing each other up for ridiculous reasons, people in California are deciding to reneg on tacit decisions made decades ago, the Oklahoma State Legislature is trying to get rid of quarter beer night, and I still have too many pages left to type on the Master's Thesis.  Yeah, it's a great morning, alright.  When did our nation become so damn stupid?  When did we all become so full of hate and fear of the mythical "Other" that we'd trample their rights, deny them equality, and refuse to recognize them as humans?  I'm not gonna rant and rave about this for paragraph after paragraph.  There are people much more eloquent than I already expressing just how ridiculous and insipid these things are.  I just wonder whatever happened to humanity.  When did we become so callow and heartless?  As a history major, I think I can pinpoint the exact moment--the minute we started acting out against one another.  So really from time out of mind, we've been finding new and exciting ways to hurt each other and strip one another of humanity and dignity.  Stupid world.  Stupid fucking world.  ~chuck cottrell  Song of the Moment: REM, "Wake Up Bomb"

       "When Will We Fall Down?"   Well, work is progressing slowly but surely on the Master's Thesis.  I've managed another page or two since I arrived at work.  It's rather slow going right now, because I'm still working on the background and stuff, and haven't made it to the document dissection part (which is where the real fun is).  Had to look at an awful paper when I first got in, but that's behind me now.  I think I'll be able to get this out of the way before I go home Monday.  I hope.  Well, back to work.  I want to shoot for 10 pages by the end of the night, and I have to get up early tomorrow morning and come to work.  Wee.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Van Morrison, "Cleaning Windows"

       "Nothing's Real, Deafening Loud"    urlLink This is what's wrong with popular music today .  Honestly, what the hell?  They give a guy who cannot sing or play any instruments a record deal?  The whole American Idol thing still strikes me as preposterous anyway, mostly because I think it cheapens the abilities of those who actually work their asses off practicing and playing in bars and making music their life.  I'm all for letting talent take its shot, but honestly, does American Idol provide us with talent, or just this 15 minutes' star?  It's corporate crap at its bloody worst, I think, and I wish they'd just cancel the whole damn show, set Simon Cowell on fire, and be done with the whole thing.  And fire that Justin guy from the first season out of a cannon without a helmet.  As big as that idiot's hair is, he'll be plenty padded for headfirst impact.  In other news, work on the Thesis has progressed to the actual writing stage.  Hoping to have 5-10 pages by the night's end.  We'll just have to see what happens.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Toad the Wet Sprocket, "Jam"

       "I'm In Heaven When You Smile"   Well, Tuesday went significantly better than Monday or Sunday.  I actually got some work done on my Thesis, lots of folks wished me well and did their best to cheer me up, and I've been listening to Van Morrison for about 24 hours straight, with obvious pauses for class and...um...unconciousness.  Went jogging with Beth again, and again we managed a 9.30 mile.  I think I've got my running schedule figured out now; all I have to do is follow it.  On Monday, Wendesday, and Friday, I'll do a slower, longer run by myself (my traditional three mile run around the neighborhood and campus).  On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'll run a shorter, faster run with Beth.  This way, I get in some sprinting and some distance.  It also means I run five days a week, taking the weekends off because I'm always busy during my usual running times.  I still feel pretty drained, emotionally speaking.  It's been tough convincing myself to do anything productive.  My mind just keeps sliding back to that damn rejection letter, which I seem to have somehow hidden from myself (I know I didn't throw it away...I keep these things, so that I can remind myself that I have to prove my abilities to others so that they'll know what they were passing up.  I still have the rejection letters from when I applied for my Master's).  I was basically only able to work on the research stuff tonight, not actual writing.  I also noticed that a good portion of my primary resources are effectively useless for the paper as I currently conceive it.  Therefore, I'm probably going to change my focus a bit to reflect the stuff I actually have.  The problem is that some of my best sources deal with stuff that happened  before  the guys that became the non-jurors actually became the non-jurors.  So I'm going to broaden the focus a bit, include some of the things (such as a thing called the Trial of the Seven Bishops) that I've got lots of good information on just because.  And I actually have a legitimate tie-in for the information--mostly, it'll show that the non-jurors had no love of James II, the deposed king, yet they respected his right to the throne and refused to accept William and Mary, whom the non-jurors saw as usurpers.  Turns out there were about 400 of these non-jurors, including the Archbishop of Canterbury (the head of the Church of England just below the monarch), five other bishops, and then hundreds of regular clergymen.  My good buddy Jeremy Collier became the third generation of bishops in the non-juror movement, it turns out, having been bestowed with his authority by a guy who was given his authority by one of the original non-juring bishops.  I've also figured out how to work in some of Collier's writings.  I had two excuses--one, he's one of the most prolific apologists (that is, defenders) of the non-jurors and the anti-William group; and two, I acutally have primary sources by him that are applicable and make the arguments I want to use.  Okay, that's probably enough of a history lesson for now.  Tomorrow, I'll spend the entire day working on this blasted thing.  And all evening.  And all the next day, except for eating lunch and running with Beth (not one right after the other, though--that wouldn't be a pretty sight).  And then all day Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, if need be.  Which it probably will.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Van Morrison, "Domino"

       "My Hands Were Clenched In Fists Of Rage"   I got a rejection letter from Washington University in St. Louis today.  It did not make me happy.  In fact, truth be told, I'm still very upset about it, and I got the letter about six or seven hours ago.  I was talking to my mom on the phone when I opened the letter, and I have to admit that I actually broke down in tears and cried for a good five, ten minutes.  It's just so frustrating.  I thought I had a great chance of getting into that school.  My talk with Dr. Hirst, a professor there (the guy I'd be working with, actually), had me convinced I could get in.  I mean, he told me I had the credentials to get in.  He said I had a really good shot.  And yet I didn't get in.  That only leaves one school--Ohio State.  Admittedly, that's the one I should, theoretically speaking, have the best chance of getting in to.  But now, after two rejections in a row, I'm starting to doubt.  I'm worried that maybe the fact that my GRE scores aren't astonishing, that my GPA isn't a 4.0, that maybe I wasn't as intelligent and impressive on paper as I thought I was...maybe I'm really not good enough.  Let me tell you, this sort of existential self-doubt is not what you want to be dealing with when you're trying to get your Master's Thesis written and you're already under time pressure.  I still haven't written anything.  I'm just...blocked.  I can't think, I can't read anything, I can't do anything.  I'm about ready to call it a day, give up, and try again tomorrow.  On the positive side, many people have gone out of their way this afternoon and evening to try to make me feel better, and I feel obligated and moved to thank them, even though I don't think any of them actually read this.  First and foremost, Amanda Erisman, for consoling me almost right after I'd found out, and for smiling for me and convincing me, if only for a moment, that things genuinely would be okay.  Thanks to the girl at the convenience store, whose name I don't even know, who is always pleasant and cheerful and willing to talk to a complete stranger and total geek like me, and actually seem interested in what I have to say, even though I'm just another idiot customer.  To my coworker Vicki, who did her damnedest to cheer me up at work this evening, and did a pretty good job of it at that.  And to my parents.  My mom for calling me up a few minutes after I'd gotten off the phone with her and offering me a few bits of wisdom that I'm trying to take to heart.  My dad for calling me while I was at work, being reasonable and logical and yet also compassionate, and helping me come up with a couple of alternate plans if everything goes pancake-shaped.  He helped me put it in perspective, and I appreciate that.  I appreciate everything they all did for me today, and all that all of my friends and family do for me everyday, starting first and foremost with putting up with my crap.  I do stupid things, I let little things get to me, and yet you all stand beside me.  And I can't tell you just how much I appreciate and need that.  Words fail me, and it's times like this when I'm reminded just how lucky I really am, the stupidity of graduate application selection committees aside.  Anyway, probably time to call it a day.  God only knows what else might go wrong if I stay awake much longer.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: The Beatles, "You've got to hide your love away"

       "I'll Hold Your Breath If That Won't Make You Blue"   It was a good weekend.  Well, except for Sunday.  Sunday rather sucked in ways I can't discuss in polite company.  But the rest of the weekend was good.  Got to spend time with Ev (watched an anime called Phantom Quest Corp., a wonderful little four-episode OVA that had a slightly subtler humor to it than most of what I usually watch).  Then went to grab some dinner with Ev and Beth...that was an interesting combination of people, though I think they got on fairly well.  I've noticed I have a very moderate personality in many respects.  I get along well with people at either end of a rather extreme spectrum, people who might not get along with each other otherwise.  Anyway, after dinner, Beth and I tracked down Jess and Dom, who came over to my place and played a bizzare party game called "Apples to Apples."  I'm not sure why we find this game so damn amusing, but we played that for three or four hours.  Then Sunday...God, Sunday was awful.  I'd received an email from my boss on Friday that a student with a temporary disability needed someone to type a paper for them.  I replied back, informing her I wouldn't mind typing a paper for a student in need.  I assumed we were talking about a three to five page little English paper.  No big deal.  A half hour, an hour at most, and we'd be good to go.  Oh, how wrong I was.  I arrived at work a few minutes before 2.00 pm, and the guy who needed stuff typed showed up at the same exact time.  he handed me what he needed done--Garibay papers.  Now, that's not going to make any sense to anyone who doesn't work with me, so let me explain: we have a guy in the athletic department who is a retired army colonel.  His name, coincidentally, is Garibay.  We usually just call him "the Colonel," even though he's retired.  Anyway, he teaches a couple of military history classes, and since he's also the assistant director of atheltic academic services (or something of that nature), a lot of the athletes end up taking his classes.  So far, so good, right?  Well, he has them do these book reviews.  He has them do the book reviews in military style.  What is military style, you ask?  Well, it's this very strict (heh, strict.  Military) format that the students have to follow.  The Colonel is trying to teach the students to write within a particular discipline, to learn how to follow directions and a specific format.  All good ideas, right?  Well, these book reviews end up being about 10-12 pages each.  And I got to do three of them.  To top it all off, I accidentally got the format wrong when I was writing the first two, so I had to go back and fix all the formatting issues.  It took me almost   nine hours   to do these three things.  By the time I was finishing, my wrists hurt, my hands hurt, and I was wondering if it was possible to feel the stigmata just from typing.  Even now, my hands and wrists are hurting, because when I say ten pages each, I mean ten  single spaced pages .  The sad thing was, I was going to use work on Sunday as prep time for writing my Master's Thesis this week.  I was going to go over all of my research, take some notes, organize my thoughts, maybe write up an outline or something if I was feeling really spry.  But no, instead I spent the whole time typing these papers.  And when I left work, I was too worn out and frustrated to even attempt to do anything productive tonight.  So I'm just gonna wake up early in the morning and start working on the Thesis then.  I have my work cut out for me, but I've got a schedule, and if I can stick to the schedule, I can have a good rough draft knocked out by Friday.  On the positive side, I did get paid double for typing those damn papers.  Pretty good, considering we didn't have anything else going on in the Writing Center all day.  I just got an email from Clif about the sort of music he's been listening to over in France.  Apparently, the poor child has had to deal with MTV France, which is sad.  He's found a few songs and bands that apparently aren't too bad, but he said the techno cover of Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb" was a little weird.  I'm gonna have to find it now just because.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Scissor Sisters, "Comfortably Numb"

       "The Stars Are Laughing At Us"   I ran today for the first time in a week.  I ran one mile by myself, then another with Beth.  The latter was faster than the former by almost a minute, proving yet again that running with someone makes me run faster.  Not necessarily as far, because God knows I was worn out after that second mile, but most definitely faster.  It's pretty quiet here at work tonight, which I don't mind at all.  I wish I'd brought my Gameboy, though--I'm a wee bit bored.  Found out something rather interesting and amusing this afternoon--Beth has a class with Audrey, the Ozarks graduate who also now attends OU.  Apparently Audrey recognized me at the movie theatre last week when we were watching  The Passion , and vaguely recognized Beth in their class as one of the people with me that night.  It's bizzare just how small the world is, really--I mean, in a school of 30,000 people, two of the maybe half dozen people I actually know here--two people who didn't know each other--happen to both be in the same class.  Craziness, eh?  I think Everett wants me to look at something for him.  My only hope is that I can actually understand the words in it.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Beatles, "I'm Looking Through You"

       "The Screaming Sky Won't Let Me Sleep"   The weather was just downright nasty today.  It rained constantly, so I didn't get to run today, either.  In fact, I haven't gone for a run since I ran with Beth last Thursday (which we plan to do again tomorrow...who knows how that'll go).  I feel lathargic and blah, as though I don't have the energy, desire, or ability to really do anything of worth.  Adam started working on redesigning the  urlLink Dim Bulb  page today.  So far, the only thing anyone will notice is that we've added a dropdown menu for the comics so you can jump to specific comics or storylines.  Adam only did the highlights for his and for Troubled Times, but I was feelin' spry, so I set it up to list every single freakin' comic I've done so far.  When the page is completely redesigned, there'll be a new background, a new layout, a different way of handling the rantspace (one which doesn't involve Adam or I accidentally erasing each other's posts and which will allow us to actually post a notice if FTP or Keenspace is down), and a list of favorite links on the main page.  All very spiffy, all hopefully accomplished sometime soon.  Really depends on Adam's schedule, though.  I'm still debating on whether or not to email the history departments at Ohio State and WUStLou to inform them of my achievement this past weekend.  Part of me wants to, just to let them know that I'm a good historian and because I think it might increase my chance of getting in to one or both of the schools.  On the other hand, part of me thinks they've probably already made their choices, and telling them now wouldn't have any effect on things if they've already decided.  I'll email Dr. Dippel tonight and see what he thinks.  Clif is apparently in Italy this week.  Mom said that he got calls at home from two of the national parks he applied to work at this summer.  This is in contrast to last summer, when he couldn't beg a table bussing job at a single damn park (he applied to several) and ended up spending half the summer in Norman with me, recording the debut Yeti album in the back bedroom of my apartment.  For some reason, I've been listening to XTC all weekend.  I pull out their stuff from time to time, because it's really well done, smart, polished pop in the tradition of the Beatles (the band members are unabashed Beatles and '60s pop-rock afficianados).  Their album  Oranges and Lemons  is especially enjoyable, and I love the song "Across This Antheap."  Good stuff.  So I've been spinning that disk all afternoon and evening.  When I get home, I might pop on their greatest hits collection and mellow out to that.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: XTC, "Across this Antheap"

       "Old Man, Look At My Life"   So I was thinking about the trip back to Shawnee earlier today, and I started pondering one aspect of it specifically--my visit to the high school.  I remember high school pretty wel, though I started it nigh on a decade ago.  I don't remember being as snotty or as rude as most of those kids.  I don't remember being as loud and obnoxious.  And maybe I wasn't.  Maybe a lot of the other kids, the ones I didn't see, are better behaved than the ones I did see.  But I distinctly remember not being that...young.  They all look and act so young.  Was I ever that young?  Part of me feels so much older than I am, like I'm already well beyond middle age and approaching dotage.  Maybe that's from studying history.  On the other hand, another part of me feels significantly younger than my actual nearly-24 years.  I feel perpetually childlike, mostly because I've kept a sense of humor about the majority of things in life (I've always said that if you can't find humor in something, you're probably taking it too seriously...though there are a few notable exceptions).  That's what allows me to keep doing the comics and find enjoyment in simple things, and to keep from becoming the sour old people I see wandering the graduate history deparment.  Many of them have scant years over me, and yet act like they are ancient, ponderous beings who cannot remember anything except musty books and stuffy libraries.  Age is such a weird thing.  It supposedly determines what we are and are not mature enough to do in this society.  Somehow, the difference between 20 and 21 is enough to allow one to legally drink.  The difference between 17 and 18 is the difference between being able to smoke, vote, and get drafted, and not being able to do those things.  But I've met small children who possess wisdom and a bearing far beyond their years.  I've met adults who are no more mature than five year olds.  It's something of a mystery how that works; how, as Monica put it, some souls seem to be "misplaced" in time.  Maybe it's a way of presenting different generations with a worldview alien to it.  Who knows.  Maybe it's silly to assume there's any sort of "logic" as we presume to know it to what God does in people's lives.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Flaming Lips, "Fight Test"

       "This Bird Has Flown"   Spent the afternoon in Shawnee, doing various and random things.  I installed my old scanner on a computer at my church, chatted with my mother, visited my grandparents (my grandfather showed me the stuff they took out of his neck Saturday...it disturbed me), and went to the high school to critique a drama piece for a friend of mine.  Also got my laundry done and fed.  These are always good things.  I'm just now remembering and realizing, though, that I left the ice chest with my milk, hot pockets, and various other "needs to be kept cool" foods sitting in the middle of the kitchen.  I completely forgot to put that stuff away.  Hope my milk doesn't go bad.  There's not really a whole lot to talk about.  Trips home are always a little strange.  I don't know how to react to them, or to home, or to the people I often encounter while there.  I end up having to make that awkward small talk, the "so, how's your life been since last I spoke with you, years ago?"  I have to summarize the past three or four years into a few short sentences.  Then I mention I'm getting my Master's in History, and they say, "oh," and their eyes immediately glaze over.  I think I've outgrown Shawnee.  It's a good little town, for the most part, but I don't fit there anymore.  In other, completely unrelated news,  Return of the King  absolutely rocked the house last night at the Oscars.  And about damn time props were given to a fantasy film, don't you think?  And props they received--all eleven Oscars they were up for, at that.  It is, I must say, a good time to be a geek.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Beatles, "You Won't See Me"

       "If I Go Crazy Then Would You Still Call Me Superman?"   So I was watching the second X-Men movie last night (a high-quality flick, for those of you who did not see it because you were living under a rock or whatever), and I came across something which was--for me--a bit of a revelation regarding the two comic book titans, Marvel and DC.  I'm going to share that revelation now, though it likely isn't anything that the one or two comic book fans who read this don't already know or that the non-comic book fans care about.  I'm sharing anyway, 'cause it's something more interesting to write about other than "I still haven't finished my research paper."  Based on a conversation I had with Ev several days ago and a re-reading of the trade paperback  Kingdom Come , a DC comic that posed a "what if the superheroes all got old" sort of scenario, and then with my viewing of X2 last night, I came up with an understanding of DC and Marvel and how they portray their superheroes.  DC's superheroes are earthbound gods.  They are iconic figures who are revered and exalted by the normal humans around them.  They are called things such as superhumans, metahumans, etc.  They are seen as above and beyond mere humanity, a logical extension and extrapolation of human potentiality in a pair of spandex tights.  These are characters who are designed to inspire, to lead, to provide an example of what humanity is capable of when we put our hearts and imaginations into it.  DC characters have their powers via some sort of destiny.  The heroes grasp their fate in both hands and claim the powers in some sort of conscious decision.  DC characters are also revered and looked up to, seen as symbols of truth and justice and good.  They are heroes by dint of their inate personal virtue, and their powers simply reflect that virtue.  Marvel's superheroes are vastly different.  Marvel characters are generally humans whose DNA and genetic structure have been altered by chance or accident.  Peter Parker was accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider.  The X-Men just happen to have had a genetic mutation which they had no control over.  Marvel heroes are generally called mutants, or, if it's a more hostile portion of the non-mutant community, freaks.  They are looked down upon by their fellow man, even feared and hated.  There's an element of McCarthyism, anti-communism, and something akin to homophobia in the way regular humans view their mutated brethren.  Both the X-Men movies make these attitudes readily apparent (the opening scene in the first movie is a wonderful charicature of the McCarthy era, with a list of "known mutants" standing in for a list of "known communists" residing in America.  The second movie has the wonderful scene in Bobby Drake's house where he admits to his parents that he is a mutant, and his mother asks, "have you tried...not being a mutant?").  These parallels run throughout most Marvel books (that I've seen).  Marvel superheroes are outsiders not because they come from outside or beyond (such as characters in the DC universe like Superman), but because they are perceived as the enemy within, the Other who is among us.  Thus superheroes in the Marvel universe are not so much revered for their abilities as they are feared and persecuted.  They are seen as aberations, not superiors, and thus they are shunned in society.  It's just an interesting comparison, I think, and probably relevant to the time periods in which both companies started their main characters (DC with Superman and Batman in the late 1930s, while the big guns for Marvel, such as the X-Men and Spider-Man, were created in the 1960s).  How much can be read into this is uncertain, though there are clear implications in it.  For instance, the fact that Superman and Batman--two of the most iconic superheroes ever--were both created during the Great Depression, when Americans needed heroes to look up to, to revere, is probably not mere happenstance.  Marvel's key characters were created in a time when social upheval and uncertainty were rampant, and people on both sides of the fight for rights and equality were fearful of the other side.  In such an environment, a group of people whose only crime was chance of birth and genetic roulette would be feared and misunderstood.  Another interesting juxtaposition (pointed out by my friend and comic afficianado Everett) is the differing socio-economic standings of DC and Marvel characters.  DC characters tend to be educated, professional adults--Superman was a reporter in a time when that was a profession.  Bruce Wayne was an old-money millionaire.  Most DC characters were in occupations or positions that required (1) a significant degree of education and (2) a certain maturity and sense of professionalism.  These were social elites who were already looked up to by the majority of the public.  On the other hand, Marvel characters are generally younger and from a lower socio-economic class.  Peter Parker was a college student who did freelance work.  The X-Men were students in a school.  These characters are not elites by any means.  Peter Parker is the epochal everyman, an average Joe who teaches school and has economic troubles.  Their economic status reflects their status with the general piublic--DC superheroes are almost universally revered and respected, while Marvel characters are not so cut-and-dry.  Spider-Man is viewed as a menace by some and a hero by others (Batman and Captain America are aberations here, as the former is greatly feared and misunderstood by many and the latter is almost universally respected in their respective universes).  The contrasts and comparisons between the two universes are intriguing, to say the least.  They are definitely reflections of the times in which they were conceived, with the DC universe taking on a much more mythic, epic tone, while the Marvel universe is grittier and more at street level.  Both have grown closer to the middle in recent years, but if you look at the movies based on these two worlds, you can still see the separation.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Five for Fighting, "Superman"

       "Ridin' The Storm Out"   It's been an interesting if rather rollercoaster few days.  I had the nice yelling match with my mom the other day (well, I say "match," but really it was just me getting pissed off and yelling at her).  Then she calls me up Friday afternoon her mood's completely changed.  She's chatting about inconsequential stuff, like having cleaned the carpet back home.  After the chit-chat, she did actually get back to the issue at hand--what I'm doing with my life.  But she took a much softer, and in my mind, better approach this time.  Rather than chewing me out for what I hadn't done or should be doing, she discussed it with me rationally and actually expressed some sympathy.  She actually ended up telling me exactly what I needed to hear this time instead of exactly what I didn't need to hear, as she had on Wednesday.  Being my mother, she of course had to nag a bit, which is only to expected.  Of course, she also wanted me to call my youngest brother up and let him know they'd be out of town this weekend.  Why she feels that my sibling, who will probably spend his time sleeping, playing video games, eating, and being spoiled by my maternal grandparents (who he said are planning to visit him this weekend), needs to be told that our parents are out of town for the weekend is beyond me.  I guess she figures that since she wants to know exactly where we are every waking moment of our lives, we want to know where she is all the time, too.  Personally, I'm of the opinion that she's a big girl and can go where she damn-well pleases.  If we need to get ahold of her, we have dad's cellphone number (even if said cellphone is never turned on).  See, my mom and dad and my paternal grandparents are currently in Eureka Springs, AR, for a little weekend getaway.  I myself am trying to figure out how any trip you take your parents on can be classified as a "getaway," since I've always operated under the assumption that you're trying to get away from them, but hey, this was my folks' idea, not mine, so they can do as they please.  Hey, maybe it's like when I take my parents somewhere, and my dad's folks will pay for everything.  Probably not, though.  In other news, I kissed Beth on Monday, and it was probably the best thing I've done since coming to Norman.  Whether or not this leads to anything else is mere speculation at this point, but even if nothing more serious develops out of this, I'm happy just being her friend, as I have been since I met her.  I'd be happy being something more, too, but I'll be content if things remain at the status quo.  Well, off for bed.  Six a.m. comes awfully early on a Saturday morning, and work is gonna be hell.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Beatles, "Act Naturally"

       "I Was Up All Night Making Up My Mind But Now I've Got My Doubts"   Had a shouting match with my mother earlier today.  That was fun, if you define "fun" as "something that was agitating and annoying and not really something I wanted to do."  Yeah, fun.  Her problem is that she thinks I need to stop feeling defeated by the whole grad school thing.  She also thinks I've been dragging my feet in regards to papers and alternate plans and suchlike.  I blew up at her and chewed her out at a high volume for a good two or three minutes about that.  I was filled with semi-righteous anger.  Semi-righteous because, to an extent, she's kinda right.  Not totally, and this isn't something I'd admit to her, mind you, but enough that it rankled.  She's also kinda wrong.  I didn't think I'd need to re-apply to this blasted school.  I thought I had Ohio State in the bag.  Finding out I didn't meant I had to rush to try to get things taken care of to stay here, if I need to.  It also means that stuff I should have been working on, I haven't been, because I've been a bit depressed.  Okay, very depressed, I just haven't shown it as much as the last time I got a rejection letter from a school (Washington University about a month ago, for those of you keeping score at home).  But it's there, believe me.  I haven't done very much on the paper for my class this semester, and I have been dragging my feet on it.  And now I'm having trouble finding sources that'll work (though some research work this afternoon may have turned up some worthwhile sources).  I don't know why I'm so apathetic and lazy this semester.  Mom pointed out that I was much more productive last semester when I had a couple of classes than I am this semester with only one class, and one that I don't even really have to attend every time at that.  I guess I'm the sort of person who needs deadlines and structure.  For better or worse, I'm not very self-motivated when it comes to certain things.  School happens to be one of them.  Comics, of course, aren't.  Neither is my writing.  But schoolwork...yeah, sometimes I'm not so into that.  Which is ridiculous, since this is what I'm wanting to do with the rest of my life.  Then again, maybe that's what the problem is--maybe this isn't what I want to do with the rest of my life.  Problem is, I don't know what I'd do with the rest of my life if not this.  As much as I'd like to, there's no way I could ever make a living with my comic or my writing or anything like that.  They're fun hobbies, but that's all they're ever likely to be.  And I'm fine with that--I enjoy drawing and writing, and that's what really matters.  It's really just a nice dream that someone would pay me enough money to live off of for doing that stuff.  No, I need to find a "real" job, I guess.  I need to get this next degree, and become a professor.  I really do like the idea of teaching.  I already enjoy sharing what I know with people all the time.  Getting paid for that is a dream I can reach.  Well, if I can get into another graduate school, it is.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Eagles, "Peaceful, Easy Feeling" (yeah, if only)

       "They Asked Me For Some Collateral So I Pulled Down My Pants"   It was a good weekend.  A freakin' long weekend, to be sure, but a good one.  Friday evening, I went over to my aunt and uncle's place in Midwest City to visit them and see my cousin's wife and daughter who're over from New Mexico.  Had a blast, tried some falaffle (or however it's spelt), which I really dug, and just sat around on their back porch all night shootin' the bull.  Got up early Saturday and drove up to Ponca City to visit my grandparents and Scott, who was over visiting them from school for the weekend.  We went up to Witchita, ate at the Olive Garden (Scott's favorite restaurant, and since we were doing this mostly to celebrate his birthday, it seemed appropriate he pick out our dining location) and then went shopping.  Found a couple things I'd have liked to have had, but nothing I couldn't live without.  Scott couldn't find a single thing he wanted, leaving him rather annoyed (I think he was looking to spend money yesterday, and then he didn't get to...this made him sad, I guess.  I dunno).  I was pretty out of it for a lot of Saturday, because it was the second day in a row I'd gotten up at 6.00 am and about the third or fourth day in a row I'd only gotten 3 or 4 hours of sleep.  But I still had a good time, and my grandmother sent me home with lots of goodies this morning (jellybeans of the Starburst variety, some homemade cookies, etc.).  When I got back to Norman, I paid a visit to Best Buy and picked up the two disc Eagles  Best Of  collection and the Beatles'  Rubber Soul .  It's funny that, as big of a Beatles fanatic as I am, I only actually own a couple of their albums.  The reason is that my dad has all of them, and it always seemed kinda silly to have copies of CDs I could drive home and borrow if I wanted.  Now, I'm thinking a bit differently.  I'm also thinking that sometime soon, I may not be anywhere close enough that I can just drive home on the weekend and borrow CDs.  So I'm starting to find all the Beatles CDs at good prices and getting them.  It's gonna take awhile--of albums, I only have  Hard Day's Night ,  Abbey Road , and now  Rubber Soul .  But I'll get there eventually.  After Best Buy, I met Jess and Dom over at a Chinese Restaurant for lunch.  It's been awhile since I've eaten Chinese (a bad experience back in high school really turned me off to the stuff for a long time), but it was good.  Beth was supposed to join us, but she had to meet with her Capstone group at like 1.30 or something, so she didn't have time.  Anyway, if I hadn't spent so much time in my car this weekend, it would've been a relaxing couple of days.  As it stands, they may not have been extremely relaxing in the physical sense (I am still feeling rather exhausted and drained), but they were very recouperative in the emotional and mental sense.  I feel I can face the rest of the semester now...which mostly involves doing that 30 page research paper I still haven't started.  I've been terrible this semester.  No motivation.  No sense of real purpose over the last couple of weeks.  I blame grad schools and their unwillingness to accept me.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Eagles, "On the Border"

       "It's Gonna Be Okay"   It is, really.  A nice conversation with Amanda E. has convinced me of this.  Not because of anything in particular either of us said.  It's just that talking with her always makes me feel better about things.  Talking to my other friends and to several members of my family also helped, I have to say.  Everyone's very supportive and comforting, and that really, really helps.  I'll get through this.  I'll come out on top.  Lesser men than I have managed, and this, too, shall pass.  George Harrison probably put it best:  "Sunrise doesn't last all morning, The cloudburst doesn't last all day Seems my love has gone and left you with no warning It's not always gonna be this way All things must pass All things must pass away."  The good, the bad, the mediocre--none of them last.  Hard times befall us all, but I have hope.  Hope that I'll overcome whatever I'm facing.  I've got faith.  There's some master plan that I may not be aware of, but it's out there.  It's out there.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Bruce Springsteen, "My City of Ruins"

       "Four Dead In Ohio," But I Swear I Wasn't The One To Kill Them   Lord knows I wish I were, though.  Yeah, I finally got fed up with waiting and called Ohio State this afternoon.  They told me, in no uncertain terms, that I was not accepted.  That just really sorta takes the cake, y'know?  Funny thing is, I'm not really upset right now.  I don't feel sorry for myself.  I'm not mad, not sad, nothing.  I mostly just feel...empty, numb, distant.  Like this is all happening to someone else, and I'm just watching from the outside, a passive viewer, a spectator in my own life.  I'm sure this'll change in the next day or two, but for now, I don't feel anything about it.  I don't really want anyone's pity or sympathy, either.  I've already had my fill of it from my parents and grandmother.  It's not that I don't appreciate their comfort or their love, just that...I don't want to think about it right now.  Not at all.  It frustrates me more than I can possibly express using words, but right now, I'm gonna ignore it.  Like I said, I don't feel sorry for myself, I don't feel cheated, I don't feel that I could have done any better than I did, or done things any different than I did.  Mostly, I just feel defeated.  Something else will come up, I'm sure--but for right now, at this moment, I'm not thinking about any of that.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: U2, "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"

       "When We Dance"   Well, it was a great weekend.  A long weekend, to be sure, but a great one nonetheless.  Started out Friday, when I hung out with Jess and Dom.  We played some MariKart, and managed to get gold in a couple more Cups (Flower and Star, both in 150cc...this means nothing to anyone who hasn't ever played a MarioKart game, but I don't really care).  Then Saturday morning, Beth and I went to Shawnee for an early Easter celebration.  Had dinner with the family, and celebrated Scott and I's birthdays with the paternal grandparents.  T'was lots of fun, and we had steak to eat.  I have the leftovers, and plan to make good use of them.  Anyway, after dinner, Beth and I headed back towards Norman, but it was only to change clothes--we decided to go hear my uncle's band play over in Yukon (a town just west of OKC, and really a part of the Metro Area).  We proceeded to spend several hours listening to my uncle rock out on guitar and watch a lot of old people get rather drunk and dance.  And some of them could dance quite well.  Some of them...could not.   Amusingly enough, Beth even managed to get  me  out on the dance floor for several tunes.  She reminded me how to swing dance, and after a quick tutoring session from my aunt, I was able to teach Beth how to Two Step.  Most of the songs my uncle's band plays--though they're rock and roll or country--are played at such a tempo that you can dance to them in one way or another.  So Beth and I listened to my uncle play until about 1.00 am, then headed back to Norman, stopping in at IHOP because we realized we hadn't eaten anything in about 10 hours.  After IHOP, it was to our respective apartments and sleep.  Oh, glorious sleep.  Granted, I had to take a shower (to wash off the overwhelming scent of cigarette smoke that clung to me because I'd been sitting in a bar with two dozen chainsmokers) and then put sheets on the bed, but those tasks were managed on autopilot.  This afternoon (not this morning), I got up and decided to run an errand for Scott (my grandmother had accidentally gotten him something he already had for his birthday, so I said I'd go exchange it and make sure it got to him next weekend).  So I drove up to Quail Springs Mall on the north side of OKC (i.e., the opposite side of the City from Norman, which is at the far southern edge of the Metro Area).  I got up there easily enough (despite not exactly remembering where the mall was--still, it turned out to be exactly where I thought it might be), and the mall was open.  However, the shops in the mall...were not.  So I figured, "oh well, I'll take it back later this week.  But while I'm up here, I'll check out the Best Buy on May Avenue."  Yeah, there's a Best Buy in Norman and another on I-240 not fifteen minutes' drive from where I live, but you never know what one will have than another does not.  So I drive to the Best Buy.  It's closed.  "Well crap," I think.  "I guess I'll go to the one in Norman."  Yeah, it was closed, too, which I guess I should have known.  After that, I hit Hastings in Norman and picked up Bob Dylan's  Bootleg Series, Vol. 1-3 , a collection of outtakes, live recordings, and unreleased songs spanning 1961-1991.  It's got some good stuff on it.  It's also got a couple songs that make you go, "thank God he didn't release this song/this particular version of this song."  That's sorta part of Dylan's genius, though, and part of his canon.  Anyway, went and got gas after Hastings, then headed back to the apartment.  Beth gave me a ring and asked me to proofread a paper for her.  She brought it over, I read it, then we went and got a pizza and watched a couple of movies (Disney's animated  The Sword in the Stone , which was one of the DVD's I got from my grandparents for my birthday--the other being  Secondhand Lions --and then the last disk of  Those Who Hunt Elves , an anime series we started several months ago and just now got around to finishing).  She then headed home, and I did a comic and another page of the Dim Bulb Forum Battle.  So yeah, all in all, a great weekend.  I think next weekend will be quite full, too.  Originally, I was going to try to go to Ozarks.  However, mom kinda squelched that idea with a few commetns about finances, the need to get schoolwork done, and things of that nature.  Intead, I'll probably be seeing a lot of my family.  My cousin's wife and daughter will be in Oklahoma (he's currently in some former-Soviet-territory-turned-independent-republic-whose-name-I-can't-pronounce), so I'll probably go visit them Friday night.  Saturday, I'll probably head up to Ponca City and visit my maternal grandparents and Scott to celebrate Scott's birthday with them (since his birthday isn't really until the 19th).  Mom approved of these plans, though I still don't see how going out and doing those things instead uses any less time or allows me to be any more productive than I would've been had I gone to Ozarks.  Ah well.  I'm still gonna try and make a trip up there sometime soon...just dunno when.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Bob Dylan, "Series of Dreams"

       "These Are Just Thoughts On Lack-Luster Times"   The past couple of days have been...interesting, to say the least.  Ev is concerned that whenever I leave OU, I won't find anyone at my new home who'll challenege me intellectually.  'Manda's haivng issues with the boy she likes (and there's a hell of a lot more to that, but none of it that the rest of you really need to know about).  I heard from an old friend of mine from Ozarks, though the circumstances were not as pleasant as either of us would have preferred (her having just been ditched by her idiot husband).  Beth's stressing out over all of her (admittedly numerous) projects.  I'm not stressing out enough over mine.  And I  still  haven't heard from Ohio State.  Starting to wonder what's going to come of me and my life, y'know?  As per usual, it's quite for ages, then everything seems to happen all at once.  I almost half-expect Scott to announce at the family dinner tomorrow night that he's gay.  Okay, so that's not likely.  Even if Scott  were  gay, he'd never admit it to himself, much less everyone else in my family.  I've felt really unmotivated lately, like I'm moving on autopilot and not really paying attention to what's going on around me.  Things are just sorta happening one after the other.  Between Point A and Point B, where Point A is waking up and Point B is going to sleep, everything seems a blur.  I'm travelling in a straight line, looking neither to the left nor to the right, to the back or the front, but merely staring at the square of the world that exists at my feet.  That's no way to live, really.  Right now, above all else, I'm feeling a little overwhelmed by fear.  And it's not all my fear--I seem to be resonanting with several of my friends right now and picking up risidual fear from them.  I'm worried about a half dozen people right now, and I'm falling somewhere near the bottom of my list.  Maybe that's why things seem so automatic in my immediate existence lately--I'm shutting myself off from my own worries and concerns in order to focus on those of my friends.  I seem oddly disconnected and distant from everything that's happening directly to me, as though it were happening to a stranger.  I'd be disconcerted about this, if it weren't for the fact that I don't seem capable of feeling so right now.  Anyway, should go to bed.  have to get up early tomorrow and go home.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Harvey Danger, "Flagpole Sitta"

       "I Don't Have Much To Say"   I keep reading the blogs of a few of my friends, and it seems they've all got profound things to say.  Witty things.  Deep, personal, introspective things.  I really...don't, right now.  I could talk about how I'm still waiting to hear from Ohio State, but there's only so much you can say about the mail not having arrived yet.  I could talk about my Master's Thesis, but I really haven't done anything new with it since I last mentioned it.  It's not that my life is going nowhere.  On the contrary; I like to think that my life is getting ready to go in a very new direction, possibly into the northern midwest.  There's just nothing particularly bad, or spectacular, or anything at all really worth writing about.  This is Jack's boring existence, to paraphrase  Fight Club .  I guess I could always whine about being single, but after a while, that gets old, y'know?  The circular arguments, the self-questioning, the self-pity...none of it actually gets me anywhere.  I'm tired of thinking about the same things over and over.  I'm tired of not having anything worthwhile to contribute to some perceived dialogue with all of humanity.  Maybe I'm just tired of being boring, mellow Chuck.  But it's not that I don't like who I am.  On the contrary; with only a few exceptions, I am very content with who and what I am.  And maybe that's the problem.  Maybe I'm complacent.  Maybe I've worn myself into a groove and a rut, a way of existence and existing that never really breaks out and does anything spontaneous anymore.  My life has become predicatable.  Some might go so far as to call it mundane, and you could probably make a fair argument for that.  Funny thing is, I'm pretty happy, for the most part.  When I'm happy, I don't really have a whole lot to write about.  The Muse is fickle.  It's like, in order to play the blues, you have to have experienced them.  In order to write about life, I have to have done something worth writing about.  No one cares that I'm in the middle of playing a couple of video games, or that I watched  Fight Club  last night after work.  In his song "Watching the River Flow," Bob Dylan sings, "What's the matter with me?/I don't have much to say."  That's sorta how I feel.  I keep thinking there are things I could talk about; deep, meaningful things I could mention and expound upon.  I keep thinking there's somethign worth talking about going on in my life.  But I can't for the life of me think of what they might be.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Bob Dylan, "Tangled Up in Blue"

       "Everybody Plays The Fool"   I've never been a big fan of April Fool's Day.  The idea of purposely trying to trick people has just never sat well with me.  That, and I'm really freakin' gullible, and folks can nail me easily.  Let's face it--I probably am way too trusting.  I accept what someone is telling me at face value, most of the time.  And while that's good, it means it's real easy for someone to trick the pants off me on days like this.  Ah well.  Such is life, I guess.  Okay, need to go draw tomorrow's comic.

       "I Want Another First Kiss Like This"   My new computer monitor (the one my folks got me for my birthday) finally came in.  I went home to get it Wednesday afternoon, and took Beth along for the ride.  She needed to go to the city anyway to run an errand, so I just took her there afterwards.  Fun-filled afternoon, a splendid time for all.  And my grandmother invited her over for Easter dinner (an invitation Beth accepted, because the chance to eat steak for free appeals to a college student).  I told her she was brave for her willingness to face another holiday dinner with my family.  Had a pleasant surprise earlier this week when I got an email from my old friend Alicia McLaughlin.  'Cept her name ain't "McLaughlin" anymore, it's "Epps."  Seems she went and got married back in October without telling me.  Guess that's what happens when you don't get a chance to regularly see someone for four years.  They go and get themselves hitched.  Apparently my friend Sarah Williams is going to do the same thing sometime soon.  The number of my single friends is dwindling.  Honestly, most of the people I know my age are either in a serious relationship, engaged, or already married.  Which is cool and all, but it makes ya stop and take stock once in a while.  Dunno what sort of inventory I end up with when I do that, but it does make me wonder what--if anything--I've been doing wrong these past few years.  In other, semi-related news, my friend Dav apparently used to be jealous of the relationship I have with Wendy.  It strikes me as funny, because he's at least the second or third guy I've known who was jealous of the close friendship I had with his (then) girlfriend.  I've no idea how this happens; I'm not a threatening or imposing guy, really.  Not at all, in fact.  I have "best friend" inscribed on my very soul, I think.  Eh, maybe a good dose of paranoia is good once in a while, eh?  I mean, makes you appreciate what you've got a little more, maybe, makes you treat your significant other better.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Led Zeppelin, "The Ocean"

       "We Make It Harder Than It Has To Be"   Sittin' here at work, without much to do right now.  There's a chance I'll be here all day, because the woman who is supposed to work the rest of the day called and is feeling rather sick.  Part of me likes the idea of working the rest of the day.  God knows I could do with the hours.  On the other hand, I'm a lazy person and would rather spend the afternoon relaxing and running the errands I need to run.  Guess we'll just have to see whether Vicki shows up in a couple of hours or not.  Put in my "Change of Major" request today, which is basically the form I have to fill out to go from being a Master's student to being a PhD student.  Took all of two minutes.  Would've had this done two months ago if the freakin' form had been available, but it only became available again today (and they want all applications for the fall in by Tuesday, with this weekend being a holiday and thus everything closed on Monday.  Someone wasn't thinking very clearly when they set these deadlines).  Anyway, with that mostly out of the way (need to call the history office here in a while and discuss with them what all I need to bring over to complete this debacle), I can start to concentrate on other things, like my Master's Thesis.  And booze.  Lots and lots of booze...okay, not really, but a man can pretend.  In other news, today is payday, and also Heather's birthday.  So happy birthday to Heather and happy payday to me (this means I can pay my rent Tuesday!  Huzzah!).  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Eagles, "The Long Run"

       "Book Of My Life"   So I've been getting these emails from the OU Library the past few weeks about a book I requested over Interlibrary Loan being overdue.  It's a book I asked for to work on my Master's Thesis, and I did indeed get this book (I think it ended up coming from OBU, actually), but I also turned all the books I had checked out for the Thesis back in right after Spring Break.  This book was among them.  So why am I getting these damn overdue notices, I wonder?  Well, I wander on down to the library last week one afternoon after work, and I have a little chat with the girl who does all the Interlibrary Loan stuff.  So she says she'll look into it, and asks me to go ahead and check my place for the book again.  Okay, sure, I'll play along--even though I know the book isn't in my apartment, my car, anyone else's apartment, or my parents' house (it never actually  left  my apartment between the time I checked it out and the time I returned it), I'll look for it again.  Anyway, I sent them an email yesterday informing them I did not have the book in my possession.  They sent me a reply back this afternoon telling me they could not find it in their stuff, either, so they'd get back to me on how much replacing the book would cost.  Now wait a minute-- I  was not the one who lost the book.  I know I returned the damn thing.  So why am I being charged money to replace it?  Yeah, I'm going down tomorrow to have another little chat to explain why the person who did not lose the book is not the person who should have to pay for it.  We'll see how it goes.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Glen Phillips, "Courage"

       Who's Returned, Now?  I Didn't Catch That   Guess what I picked up last night at midnight?  No, not the new Avril Lavigne CD.  God, get your head on straight.  Here's a hint--it deals with the return of certain monarchial figures to their rightful place.  Yup, that's right-- Return of the King !  It was all I could do to not go ahead and watch it last night after I got it.  The only thing that really stopped me was having to wake up early this morning to come in to work.  But it'll probably get watched sometime this week, I can almost guarantee it.  And if nothing else, Jess, Dom, Beth, and I are planning a  Lord of the Rings  marathon for sometime this weekend (probably Monday, Memorial Day, actually) with the first two Extended Editions and the regular version of  Return of the King , since that's all we have of the third one so far.  But just think--isn't it nice to see a sci-fi/fantasy triology that actually lives up to expectations and does not disappoint like a couple of others I could mention?  Kudos, Peter Jackson.  Kudos.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Cake, "Long Line of Cars"

       "You Take Me Far Away--Not From Myself, But From My Pain"   First, an  urlLink interesting link  I found earlier today about Ford's new electric/gas hybrid SUV.  That's right--they're finally gonna make one of those damned things that  doesn't  guzzle gas.  I'm rather impressed with the idea, mostly because Ford managed to create a hybrid car that (1) looks decent (that's the biggest problem I think most people have with the hybrid cars--they look butt-ugly) and (2) meets the desires of the American public.  I mean,the thing is basically a Ford Escape with a few mechanical differences, right?  It's a pretty impressive thing.  I think I want to get a hybrid car...when I can afford one.  Admittedly, it's going to be a long, long time before I can afford to buy  any  sort of car by myself.  Anyway, on to other, more immediate things...  Jess, Dom, and Beth came over last night for dinner.  I'd received a heckuva mess of leftovers from my aunt Saturday night, so we had a little cook-in (like a cookout, only done inside the apartment) and just sat around all night shooting the proverbial bull.  We basically just hung out for about eight hours straight, spending most of that time just talking about anything and everything.  As a result of said talking, I came to a very definite conclusion--Jessica and I should not discuss politics or religion.  There are certain things we agree on.  Faith, rather than religion, is what's important.  Politicians are idiots.  Beyond that, it's almost a guarantee that if I have one opinion of a given topic, her opinion on it will be the opposite.  She's a very conservative individual, and I'm...not.  I'd probably describe myself as a moderate liberal.  I don't agree with a bunch of the crap that people have attached to the term "liberal," such as throwing money at a problem to make it go away, etc., but I'm also definitely not a conservative.  Conservatives are almost instinctively distrustful of intellectuals, and I kinda consider myself one of those.  But get Jess and I discussing politics, and it's like a house on fire--lots of yelling and screaming, and a good chance there won't be any survivors.  But when we got out of the realm of "stuff that should not be discussed because it just pisses people off," we had some good conversations, the four of us.  One of the interesting things we talked about was why Jessica is in the job she's got.  She really doesn't like it, and we're not entirely sure what keeps motivating her to get out of bed in the morning and go to work.  Part of it has to deal with the idea of a greater purpose that she cannot see.  Y'know, God's plan or something to that effect.  Things happen for a reason, as far as I can tell, though we don't always recognize that reason or why it's important.  So then the conversation strays to what I'm supposed to be doing with my life, and why maybe I got rejected by all those grad schools--maybe that's not what I'm supposed to do.  Maybe I'm supposed to do something with this Seminary in Louisville that keeps calling me all the time.  Maybe that's my purpose--to go join the ministry.  But I'm still not certain about that, and I think I know why--I don't think I'm good enough for that.  I honestly don't think I'm a good enough or devout enough individual to become a minister and lead a group of people on their spiritual journey.  I have nowhere near the confidence to do that at this point in my life.  It's not that I don't believe there's a God or anything like that--I believe that even when all the physical evidence seems to suggest there couldn't be a supernatural being.  It's more that...I don't think I'm a very good person.  Not just that I occasionally stumble or occasionally do something sinful or wrong, but I think I have some intrinsic personality traits that make me poorly designed to lead others on their spiritual paths.  Maybe it's risidual guilt that's been pounded into my head from reading St. Augustine.  That guy wanted everyone to think they were bad, bad, bad.  We're all inately sinful, according to him.  That's not something I like to believe--I think good and evil are choices we make on a daily basis, even if we're not aware we're choosing--but I think too often, I don't choose good.  It's not that I explicitly choose evil, but I think I often fail to choose good.  And I'm not certain that's good for a clergyman of any denomination.  I'm going to try to call the Seminary today or tomorrow and see why they keep calling me.  I'm curious, I'm admit, and it may be a way to get out of Oklahoma.  Admittedly, it'd land me in Kentuky, which isn't so much a step up as it is to the side, but still...it's a change, and it's something new.  All I really know is that I can't stay here.  Oklahoma will swallow me whole if I stay here.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Glen Phillips, "Far Away"

       "Baby Said She's Travelling On The One After 909"   Went to my aunt and uncle's place last night for a bit of food and entertainment.  The guys from my uncle's band were gathered with their wives to have a baby shower for the drummer's wife (who is pregnant enough to pop any day now...as my aunt said, there's no way this woman will make it to the 17th of June.  I'd be surprised if the baby wasn't born by the end of next week).  So they fed me, and they played music.  It was a fun evening, though the music wasn't as great as I was hoping for.  The biggest problem was that (1) they mostly played bluegrass, and (2) when they played a song I did know and knew the words to, they'd play it in a key I couldn't sing.  Now, the bluegrass thing isn't that big of a deal.  I can handle bluegrass, in small doses.  Admittedly, this was like a four or five hour dose, but no worries.  The other bothered me more, because I came across sounding completely awful every time they played a song I knew (with the exception of Van Morrison's "Wild Night," which I can sing very well, and Tom Petty's "Listen to Her Heart," which I think I did decently on).  But all the Beatles tunes they played were out of my (admittedly limited) range.  Ah well.  I got lots of leftovers from the shin-dig.  Beth and I are gonna dig in to some of the hamburgers here in a while, actually.  Haven't talked about Dim Bulb in a while.  All the comics are neck-deep in plot right now.  I'm getting ready to reach the end of a storyline in Crooked Halo (should end in about a week and a half, actually).  Adam's building up steam in Vapor Lock.  And Troubled Times is getting ready to have a nice little twist or two to keep everyone nice and interested.  As far as numbers are concerned, Dim Bulb is doing quite well.  We're averaging about 90-95 unique visitors per day, and this makes me happy.  Folks seem to like our work and keep wanting to come back to see more of it.  I'd like to be able to top 100 unique visitors per day if we can manage it.  We're on the verge of it--not bad for a year's worth of work, eh?  Wow, a year...hard to believe that on the 18th of June, Dim Bulb will be a year old.  We've grown a lot and made a lot of good connections.  Just imagine what year two will be like.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Beatles, "Across the Universe"

       "Fighting For A Lost Cause"   Finally got the rejection letter from Ohio State this afternoon.  It was accompanied by the pile of junk mail that usually inhabits my mailbox--rather telling, I thought.  One interesting thing I did note in the letter that I hadn't seen in any of the others I've received thusfar--they said if I wanted to call and talk to them and find out how to strengthen my application, I should feel free to do so.  This is not an offer I've received from anyone else thusfar.  I'm going to take them up on it, even if not to get into Ohio State, but rather some other university.  Any and all help to get me out of this God forsaken state would be wonderful.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Beck, "Lost Cause"

       "And Instead Of Saying All Of Your Goodbyes"   So I was talking with Beth yesterday afternoon after we'd gone to get some frozen custard (it seemed a nice way to round out our meal--I actually  cooked , though using the term "cooked" to apply to heating up meat on a grill and making instant rice may be stretching the term just a bit), and she mentioned it was just now hitting her that she probably won't be seeing most of her friends again for a very long time, if at all.  "These are the people I've seen every day for four years," she said.  These were the people she'd gone to class with, stayed up all night studying with, had movie marathons and random fun with.  These were the people she'd chosen to spend four years of her life with, and now they are having to part.  It's not an easy thing--even two years after I graduated from Ozarks, I still have trouble dealing with being separated from the people I chose while I was there.  But here's the dilemma, the eternal problem that we have to attempt to solve as we go through life--we can't stay where we are.  We cannot remain static, in the same place for ever and ever, though some may try.  There is no going home in the metaphysical sense, because when you go back, it's never the same.  Even when I go to visit Ozarks, a place that felt very much like home, I have this bizzare sense of being an insider and an outsider all at once.  It feels as though I never left, and as though I no longer belong.  We don't necessarily outgrow these places, these people, and it's not that we change so much that we're no longer compatible with them, just that our time here is over.  These people remain your friends, but the nature of the friendship has to change somewhat.  Rather than just hanging out with someone, you talk to them over the phone or via the internet.  You send messages back and forth across distance as opposed to across the room or across town.  One of my favorite songs is "Do You Realize??" by the Flaming Lips (a band that's quickly becoming one of my favorite contemporary bands).  It's a very moving song, very beautiful, and full of hard truths set to a poignant melody.  The chorus runs something like this:   "And instead of saying all of your goodbyes Let them know you realize that life goes fast It's hard to make the good things last You realize the sun doesn't go down It's just an illusion caused by the world spinning 'round."   Life does go fast.  It is hard to make anything, good or bad, last.  So I think rather than saying goodbye to my friends--something that I, like Beth, will have to do all too soon, when she leaves in a few short weeks--I should let them know how much I love them.  All of my friends, regardless of who or where they are, and when I last saw them or when I'll next see them.  That's the only thing that makes life worth living, it's the only thing that keeps us sane.  We have to cherish what we have, but we cannot cling to it too much, for everything is transient and temporary, and nothing lasts forever.  That doesn't mean I don't appreciate the time I've spent with my friends, or that this is the end of anything.  Life is full of meetings and partings, comings and goings.  While part of me may feel that by having to stay at OU a while longer, I'm being left behind by those I've grown close to here, that is not necessarily the case.  That's just the illusion caused by the world spinning 'round.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Flaming Lips, "Do You Realize??"

       "Homeward Bound"   Various conversations in the past couple of days have revealed several impending homecomings.  I spoke with Amanda Webster on the phone earlier this afternoon (it was around 10.00 pm in Ireland, where she is), and she and the Ozarks group that went to Ireland (which includes the indomitable Amanda Erisman as well) are leavin' on a jetplane bright and early tomorrow morning to come back to the States.  So they'll be back sometime late tomorrow evening, and though I'm sure they'll be sad to leave beautiful Ireland, I'll be glad to have them back...even if it only means that I'll be able to have internet conversations with them on occasion (I still need contact with them, after all).  Also spoke with my aunt yesterday afternoon.  Aside from inviting me to their place this Saturday for food and music (an invitation which I gladly accepted--like I'd pass up free food), she told me that my cousin--who's in one of those eastern Europe republics formed out of the decaying corpse of the former Soviet Union--will be coming home a week from today.  Granted, he'll just be returning to New Mexico for the time being, but apparently the first chance he gets, he and his wife and daughter are going to be coming to Oklahoma for a welcome home party.  And in November, when he's discharged from the Air Force, apparently they're moving back to Oklahoma permanently.  S'funny--I'm trying my damnedest to get the hell out of this state, while my cousin is trying with all his might to get back  in .  It's a funny ol' world, ain't it?  Been hard at work gathering tunes for Jessica and Dominic's wedding.  Aside from drawing two weeks' worth of comics yesterday afternoon, that's about the only productive thing I've done all week.  I feel kinda guilty for being so unproductive, but at the same time...hell, I need the break.  And...I'm trying to spend as much time with Beth and Jess & Dom as I can while I still can.  After all, Beth is leaving right after the wedding, and the next time I'll get to see her is in mid-August, when we take her to Florida.  And there's not much chance of me being able to pop down to Tallahassee to visit that often, y'know?  And who knows where Jess and Dom will be after they get back from their honeymoon.  Y'know, it feels like I just  did  this not too long ago when I left Ozarks.  Why the hell is it happening again so soon?  Blarg.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Steve Miller Band, "Abracadabra"

       "Foolin' Yourself And You Don't Believe It"   So Scott and I were supposed to go see Styx and Peter Frampton last night at the Zoo Ampitheatre in OKC.  This is an outdoor venue.  There were several inches of rain dropped on central Oklahoma yesterday afternoon.  Needless to say, the concert was rescheduled for the middle of July.  What that meant was that Scott and I sat around and played videogames all last night instead.  Didn't really get anything accomplished in any of the games (well, in MarioKart, which was the only game I was concerned with doing anything in), just sorta tooled around and had some fun.  Then we got up this morning and I took him back home, got my hair cut (and my beard trimmed, 'cause it was getting a wee bit scraggly), and had a quick bite o' lunch with our grandmother.  Then I ran back to Norman, picked up my paycheck, and came to work.  Work has been...quiet.  There's no one here.  We had one student all afternoon, and he was pretty self-sufficient (except for when I had to proofread his one paper, which took all of ten minutes out of my busy schedule).  Tonight, Beth and I are going to run, then give Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles multiplayer a shot.  Should be fun.  I've been playing through in single player, and I'm progressing nicely in that.  But the whole point of getting this game (aside from having an RPG on the Gamecube) was so that Beth could play with me.  We've got all the equipment we need (two Gameboy Advances, link cables to allow us to use said GBA's as 'Cube controllers, the game), so it's time to see how this works.  I'm rather excited.  There's other stuff to talk about, I'm sure, but (1) it's quittin' time and (2) not sure I want to talk about it yet.  Kinda funny to be afraid to post something in a "personal" thing such as this, but then again, I remember that several of my close friends read this thing, and I'd surely hear about anything I did post that was of a controversial nature.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Beatles, "Tell me what you see"

       "Talkin' All Night Long"   Yesterday was an interesting day.  Clif and I spent the day recording a couple of new songs (three brand new songs, a re-recording of "Substance Abuse," and a self-parody of "Never Knew Joy" called "Never Knew Flight").  Then I went for a short and rather pathetic jog, then Beth and I went video game shopping.  See, I got Beth a Gameboy Advance for a graduation gift (Scott was able to find a really good deal on one on eBay).  Well, she wanted one specifically for one game: Sword of Mana.  So we went in search of Sword of Mana (ended up finding it at Best Buy for $30, which was the best price we could find in town).  During our search, however, we ran across Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles at Target on sale for $40.  Now, I've been wanting to get Crystal Chronicles.  Beth even said she'd play it with me (it plays a lot like the old Secret of Mana game, in that it's an RPG but not a turn-based one.  No, you just get to hack-and-slash your way through to your heart's content).  So that was part of the motivation for even getting her a GBA--that way, she play.  Well, having found it on such a good deal (it's usually $50), and a deal that was ending that day, Beth went ahead and picked it up for me (I'm gonna reimburse her on payday this Friday).  So I was a happy boy about that.  After making our video game purchases, we had dinner with Jessica and Dominic, then returned to my place for some four-player MarioKart action.  Ended up unlocking a couple of new characters even, which surprised me--I didn't think there were anymore characters to unlock.  Jessica and Dominic left around midnight so Jess could get some sleep and get up early to go to work, and Beth and I sat in my apartment for the next three hours just chatting.  And I went into blithering, blabbering idiot mode, and just started saying anything and everything that's concerning and worrying me: school, work, my Master's Thesis, what I'm going to do next year, and things of that nature.  And then I bring out the big guns--abandonment issues.  With her and Jessica and Dominic all leaving soon, it's hitting me pretty hard.  I had to leave Ozarks a couple of years ago, and that was one of the hardest things I've ever done.  And here I'd just gotten used to being around these people, just gotten comfortable with them, and they have to leave.  Blah.  I mean, it's not like it's their fault or anything for leaving, and I don't blame them for it or anything.  I just...don't look forward to having to try to make more new friends.  And of course, there's also the whole question of what Beth and I kissing actually amounted to.  We talked about that, too (told you I went into blithering idiot mode).  As I told Beth, I'm the sort of person who, metaphorically speaking, sees a thread and has to pull it to see what happens and where it leads.  Turns out this one really doesn't lead anywhere--the incident was something of an abberation, a one-time deal, and not likely to ever happen again.  But I'm okay with that--as I told Beth, and as I've said ever since I started being around her more and more, I'm content just being her friend.  I'd like more than that, but my world will not be shattered if she and I remain just friends.  We still get to hang out, it's not like there's awkward silences or anything.  So at least it isn't going to ruin anything between us.  Well, work is over.  Perhaps more later.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: David Gray, "Magdalene"

       "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"   I think graduation is one of the most bittersweet moments in life.  On the one hand, hey, you've just done something wonderful and impressive and worth being proud of.  You have accomplished something big.  On the other hand, this part of your life has come to an end.  My friends will soon be leaving me.  This time next month, Jess and Dom will be getting married or already married (I can't remember the exact date).  Then they'll head off on their honeymoon.  Beth'll leave me for New York.  When Jess and Dom return, who knows where they'll end up.  Maybe still here, maybe Shawnee, maybe OKC...  And in August, we move Beth to Florida State.  They're all leaving me again.  It's like Ozarks all over again, only this time, it'll be worse.  This time, it's not possible to go back for a visit.  There're no new people to look forward to meeting in a new place, because I'm still stuck in the same place.  And my refuge, Clarksville, is losing most of the people who made it so.  All of these notions hit me this past evening while I attended the Geosciences Graduation at OU for Beth and Dominic.  Wandering around the reception afterwards, taking snapshots for Beth of her and all her friends...several of them will be in the close proximity to one another next Fall.  I know at least one or two of Beth's friends are going to Florida State as well.  Most of my close friends are leaving me.  I think I'm just feeling sorry for myself, but I hating parting.  I hate it when those I love go away, even if that's exactly what is right for them to do.  But I hate the loneliness, and loathe myself all the more sometimes for the fact that I'm not leaving, too.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: New Radicals, "Crying Like a Church on Monday"

       "Mother We Just Can't Get Enough"   Well, got my 30 page Tolkien paper finished up a few hours ago.  It's been a fairly busy several days since I last wrote.  Finally felt well enough Wednesday to start writing.  Had six pages by the end of Wednesday.  Had 20 by the time I finally collapsed this morning around 4.30 or 5.00 (note to self--staying awake all night is all well and good if you've  not  been sick for the better part of a week and have actually been eating enough to give you the energy to do so).  Got up this morning and added another eight and a bit pages, added a Works Cited and Title pages, emailed it off to the professor (he's out of town, and wants our final exams and my paper via email).  Then I went and actually paid my rent (which I should have done Monday, but...that was Monday.  We all remember Monday, right?  Yeah, I couldn't hardly walk across my  apartment  on Monday, there was no way I was walking across  campus ).  While I was out paying rent and returning books to the library (on time for once!), I happened to run into Beth and her mother (long story involving her mother actually trying to get into Norman yesterday, but I'll save that for tomorrow or the next time I don't really have anything to post about in particular.  I'm a man on a mission here).  So here I am--haven't showered yet, because I've been typing all day, and I figured if I was gonna walk around campus in the heat of May in Oklahoma, I should wait until after I'm done with that to shower.  I haven't shaved in a few days, 'cause I've been lazy and busy.  And I'm wearing my glasses, again because I've been writing and because I'm lazy.  I've just got some old running shorts on (don't worry, my "running shorts" are actually more like basketball shorts--really long and loose.  I wasn't about to go wandering around in those skimpy near-thongs that runners call "shorts"), a ratty old undershirt, and yesterday's overshirt just tossed on over it so I'm not a complete slob.  Later jokingly accused Beth of having planned that random encounter.  On the other hand, when we were introduced, her mother said, "this is The Chuck?"  I found the definite article amusing.  Guess I'm singular or something.  Beth said it's mostly because virtually everyone else she knows of, she knows more than one person by that name.  Not so with Chuck--I'm unique and stuff.  Anyway, I've been all productive and stuff the past couple of days, but my work still is not done.  Yes, the Tolkien paper is finished and sent, but I still have to do the take home exam for that class.  And I need to do it today, really.  And I have no motivation to do it.  Not only that, I haven't the slightest clue how to even start going about writing this damn thing.  The question doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, and I don't really know how to answer it at the moment.  What I'm thinking will probably happen is I'll take a break from this crap, not think about history for a while, and reapproach it later tonight, when I've rested a little and had a few hours to enjoy myself and not feel so pressured to get crap done.  It's 6.00 pm on the bloody last day of finals.  I shouldn't be this stressed still.  This time last year, I was kickin' back, having spent most of the week working in the writing center (well, not "working"...more like "reading Terry Pratchett novels and doodling").  Even last semester wasn't so bad.  Why is it the less structure I have, the more stressed I seem to be?  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Alice Cooper, "School's Out"

       "Called The Tune To Many A Torture Session"   So I'm feelin' really, really sick right now.  It all started late Saturday afternoon.  I'd been kinda sore and achy all day, mostly because I only got like three hours of sleep Friday night, and they weren't comfortable hours of sleep.  My shoulder, the back of my neck (where it meets the base of the skull), and my head were all aching like nobody's business.  I took some Advil stuff, and it make the aching go away, for the most part.  Then I slept for about 12 hours.  That was nice.  But it didn't solve the problem.  When I woke up yesterday, I still felt a little blah.  Not only that, but during the night, I'd woken up several times dripping with sweat.  Hurray for feavers, eh?  Anyway, I went to work yesterday afternoon, and was feeling pretty nasty still.  It took me two hours to get my body temperature regulated--from about the time I woke up until about 2.30, I felt too warm, but also kinda clammy.  Then I started getting cold chills while I was at work, and I was running a feaver again.  So around 6.30, I finally decided to pack it in and go home.  I wasn't doing anyone any good, I was aching in my neck and head again, and I was feeling lightheaded.  It took me ten minutes just to walk back to my car, and almost another ten to get back home (and home is only a three or four minute drive, even with heavy traffic).  I took more medicine and crashed again for a few hours.  Then I woke up around 9.30, went out and got some food, ate, puttered around the apartment for a few hours (though not at a very fast pace...I was still feeling lightheaded whenever I moved too quickly), and went to bed again.  Woke up this morning still feeling pretty nasty.  Until about an hour ago, I couldn't sit up in a chair for more than a few minutes without feeling lightheaded.  I'm feelng a bit better now, but not much.   And this is all very, very bad.  I've got too much to do this week to be sick.  And I have to work every night, and I don't want to get anyone at work sick.  Mom thinks it might be a bug of some sort.  Ev thinks it's stress-related.  I don't know why I feel like crap, but I know I'm sick of being sick.  All I can say is that I need to be able to concentrate so I can get my paper and my take home exam done by Friday afternoon.  They HAVE to be done.  No more extensions, y'know?  Besides, I can't get anyone to come near me while I'm like this.  And that's probably the most annoying part of all.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Counting Crows, "Kid Things"

       "Does Whatever A Spider Can"   Went and saw the midnight showing of  Spider-Man 2  last night.  It was a great flick, and I thought it was even better than the first one (and I really dug the first one).  The effects were sharper, the villain not as bizzare (Willem DeFoe was a great villain, I think, but the guy they had playing Doc Ock was just so damn believable in his motivations and the way he expressed his inner dialogue through his expressions), and the characters much more developed.  Most of the problems the first one had were in that the film was having to establish most of them and tell Spider-Man's origins.  With that already out of the way, the characters were allowed breathing room, growing room.  The cinematography was classic Sam Rami, with quick camera cuts and fast zooms.  Think  Evil Dead Trilogy .  There's even a nice homage to  Army of Darkness  in one scene in the hospital, complete with a little chainsaw and trying to lop off an arm...of sorts.  The fight scenes were excellent throughout the film.  Spidey and Doc Ock went at it on trains (though as Dom pointed out, there is no elevated train in New York), the sides of buildings, in mid-air, and pretty much all across New York City.  Doc's "smart arms" were just damn cool, and worked surprisingly well, despite my initial misgivings about CGI'd arms flailing all over the place.  Whereas the first film dealt mostly with responsibility,  Spider-Man 2  focused on choice and issues of identity, specifically with having one's personality split down the middle and caught between two different aspects.  Spidey and Doc Ock are the two most obvious examples of that identity crisis, though Harry Osborn gets a bit of it too towards the end.  The film works very well on several levels, managing to continue the threads of the previous movie and seem like a continuation of it, while at the same time standing alone as a film in and of itself and managing to create new threads and plotlines to explore in future installments.  All in all, I was very impressed with the film.  It was that rarest of movies--a sequel which was even better than the original.  The only flaw was that the soundtrack spawned another of those songs which we'll have to listen to all summer long.  Last time, it was some post-grunge sludge from the guy who fronts Nickelback.  This time around, it's an emo tune by Dashboard Confessional.  You know that'll get annoying 'round about the end of July, by which point in time the pop stations will have played it three or four times a day for almost two months.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Moxy Fruvous, "Spiderman"

       "I Know It's Only Rock And Roll (But I Like It)"   My affection--nay,  obsession --with music is probably well-known by anyone who has spoken with me for more than about five minutes.  A common sight at Ozarks when I was attending there (and now at OU, though no one here knows me) was me walking across campus with my head down, headphones on, and humming a tune.  I'm always listening to music.  I turn on music when I wake up.  I listen to music when I go to bed.  I have music playing while I shower, while I work, while I drive, while I walk, while I draw and write and think and exist.  Basically, unless I'm dead, I'm probably listening to music.  One thing I've never really given much thought or consideration to, though, is precisely  why  I'm so addicted to music.  Sure, it's fun, it's expressive, and it's got a good beat and you can dance to some of it, but why is music so important to me as an individual?  Lots of other people like music, but few of the people I know are so fierce in their expounding of the art's virtues, and so vehement in their defense of what they classify as "good music."  So, why me?  I think a lot of it comes from my father.  Some of my strongest childhood memories involve he and I sitting in the floor of the living room and listening to Beatles records while he told me about the time when the Beatles were together.  Back then, the music was just fun--songs like "Yellow Submarine" and "Lovely Rita" were and are rather infectious pop tunes, and it's hard not to sing along--but more than that, music was a way to connect to my father, a way to relate to him.  Listening to music was a shared activity between he and I, and since he was usually gone all the time on business, moments such as that were sometimes hard to come by.  In the fifth grade, my father took me to see my first concert--the Doobie Brothers.  The concert was a birthday present for me, though my dad has since admitted that really it was more just an excuse for him to go see one of his favorite bands perform.  I knew maybe three Doobie Brothers songs at the time--"Blackwater," "China Grove," and "Jesus is Just Alright"--but enjoyed the show nonetheless.  It sparked something inside of me, something which has only grown stronger with time.  After the Doobie Brothers concert, I began attending more and more rock shows, and I loved them all.  I saw ZZ Top, Tom Petty, Genesis, Van Halen, CS&N (that's Crosby, Stills, and Nash), Aerosmith, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, REO Speedwagon, Styx, Eric Clapton, 1964: The Tribute, and other, not-so-well-known acts.  I loved every one of them.  Music, then, is my connection with my father.  We still talk about music all the time; about bands we like and dislike, about the best albums, about whether or not the new album coming out by some classic rocker is worth the purchase, and about what makes good music.  Our tastes run parallel in many cases, though I've since branched out from where I started with my father.  But it's a strong common ground for us when we have very little in common as far as interests and aptitudes are concerned.  He's a math person, interested in cars.  I am more interested in reading and writing and drawing than I ever will be in cars, and I can't do a math problem to save my life (though I can sit and debate philosophy and theology for hours on end).  We're very different people, but music connected us.  Music connects me to many of my friends.  I've used it as a common ground, as a starting point to get to know someone, and as a way of expressing my own thoughts when I couldn't put them in words.  People who discount the power of music really have no idea what they're talking about, and I like to think my life, such as it is, is a testament to the fact that music can and does have power.  It inspires, it consoles, it expresses what cannot be expressed in mere words, it lights a fire in the soul and lets us soar beyond the merely physical.  To quote Blur, "music is my radar."  Maybe that bores other people, and maybe they think I make too much of a big deal out of music and its power, but I can't think of any other form of entertainment that can have the emotional impact music has on me.  Let's see a sitcom truly break your heart or heal it.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Billy Joel, "It's still rock and roll to me"

       "Rock Is Dead They Say--Long Live Rock"   So last night I lifted weights for the first time in about three years.  Today, I hurt like hell.  My  elbows  hurt.  My freakin' elbows!  What's that about, honestly?  I am glad I went and worked out with Jess and Dom, and maybe I'll be able to make it a regular thing (which would be good.  I could use some upper body strength, since I have...well, none).  Back when I was actually working out fairly regularly, I enjoyed it well enough.  Time and my eratic schedule will tell if this is something I can do regularly.  Finally beat the first Mega Man game.  The difficulty lay in two issues--first, the final area is divided up into three levels.  If you get a game over, you'll start in the level you were in.  But if you turn off the Gamecube, even if you've saved your game, you'll start back over at the first level.  The second problem came in the last level.  You have to fight four of the six robot masters right in a row--Bomb Man, Flame Man, Ice Man, and Guts Man--and then immediately go on to fight Wily.  Nothing in between any of these (well, there's an anteroom between the robot masters and Wily's room, where you start if you die against Wily...which is nice).  That means you have four boss battles in a row.  Bomb Man isn't too hard--you hit him with Flame Man's weapon, avoid his bombs, and you're in the clear.  Flame Man is quite a bit more difficult.  You literally cannot dodge all of his attacks, so you end up taking a lot of damage while trying to kill him as fast as possible.  Ice Man is a lightweight and can be defeated before he's even hit you once.  Guts Man falls somewhere between.  He usually hits me once or twice, but by the time I get to him, Flame Man's probably roughed me up pretty good, so once or twice can kill me.    But I've beaten that game now, so no worries.  Jess and Dom want to try and go see the midnight premiere of  Spider-Man 2  tonight.  I'm definitely in favor of that.  If I do happen to go, I'll have my thoughts on that available tomorrow.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Traveling Wilburys, "Heading for the Light"

       "Oh, The Hours I've Spent Inside The Coliseum"   So I'm taking part in something akin to the now-defunct Keenspace Battle Royale called the  urlLink Keenspace Colesium .  This time, instead of a free-for-all, it's a one-on-one competition, so I guess it's really more like the battle I had with the  urlLink Noise Monkey .  Anyway, the Coliseum battle is taking place  urlLink here .  Each contestant gets to make three responses, basically, and then the referee/judge guy decides which of us won based on his own arbitrary judgment and how funny our respective responses were.  My first response is already up, so we'll see how they handle my move.  Today I have to go get fitted for a tux for the Monkey's wedding in August.  I'm not a big fan of having to wear the monkey suits, especially in Arkansas in August, but it is for the Monkey, and I think I get to give him a hard time at the reception.  So that's worth it.  The network's having trouble again today.  It went down while I was typing this up.  Thankfully, it came back up (otherwise, you wouldn't be reading this, would you?).  I swear, you wouldn't think the network would be that hard to maintain here.  But, for reasons I do not understand, it appears to be.  Argh.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Counting Crows, "New Frontier"

       "Just Thinkin' Of A Series Of Dreams"   Went and saw  Hellboy  last night.  Very enjoyable flick, I must say.  Better than I thought, though maybe not as great as it coulda been (a couple of things were never explained to my satisfaction).  Having never read the comic it's based on, I can't say how faithful it is to the original source material, but from what I understand, it did a fine job of remaining true to the original.  And it was just good clean fun, too.  The Mega Man Anniversary Collection and Final Fantasy Tactics Advance continue to dominate my videogame time.  I'm almost through all of the first Mega Man game, and discovered that in order to move on to the others, you have to beat them in order.  So I kinda need to finish the first one to keep going.  Which would be fine, except the infamous Yellow Devil at the end of the first Wily Stage is a huge pain in the ass.  In the original Nintendo version of the game, you could take advantage of a glitch in the game to totally wipe the floor with this guy.  You'd set your weapon to the Elec Man weapon, then hit the Yellow Devil with a shot of it.  While the hit is actually hitting the enemy, you pause the game.  Then you unpause, then pause again really fast.  Repeat this.  Every time you unpause the game, it hits the Yellow Devil again, so you can take the bastard out with one or two shots if you're good.  But they "fixed" that in the Anniversary Collection.  No more pause trick against the Yellow Devil.  Instead, he keeps kicking my ass over and over again.  Ugh.  Tonight, Ev's gonna show me a Joseph Campbell/Bill Moyer (I think) interview he taped off PBS ages ago.  It's supposed to be this really interesting interview, where Campbell (a Jungian thinker whose concept of heroic archetypes and conceptions of mythology and storytelling are world-reknowned and highly revered in many circles) just sits and talks about virtually everything for like six hours (we're only watching the first part tonight, I believe).  That'll be cool.  Had a couple of strange dreams which I only half-remember.  One dealt with this idea I had for a comic book about Batman.  It was a weird cross between Kingdom Come, The Dark Knight Returns, and Batman Beyond.  Something about Batman deciding to retire and pass on his legacy to someone else or something, I dunno.  It was weird, but in the dream I thought it was a great idea.  The second one is even more fragmented, though no less surreal.  I was in a large parking lot, filled with cars and people moving around and between the cars.  I was walking towards my car, and there were a couple of middle-aged, white-trash-looking people standing right next to it.  For some reason, the passenger window was open, and there was a handful of pocket change on the dashboard.  These people, whom I did not know, were digging through the change, looking at the various coins and making comments about rarity and stuff, and keeping the ones they liked.  I recall chewing out, but I have no idea what I said, beyond a generic "what the hell do you think you're doing?!"  It was rather bizzare.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Wilco, "The Late Greats"

       "Rock And Roll Never Forgets"   Picked up the Mega Man Anniversary Collection for the Gamecube earlier today.  Pretty sweet collection--all eight of the original series Mega Man games (the first six were for the old NES, number seven was for the SNES, and the eighth was released for the Playstation and Sega Saturn, I believe).  The collection was released simultaneously for both the Gamecube and the Playstation 2, each with unique content.  Thing is, Gamecube owners kinda got hosed here.   First problem : the issue of remixed music.  It's available for both games, but on the PS2, it's something you can have going while you're actually playing the game.  For the Gamecube, it's something you have to unlock, and can then access as a sort of special feature in a soundtest thing, not something that plays during the actual game.  This in and of itself isn't that big of a deal, since for me the collection is mostly about getting to play all these games.  But there are other concerns as well...   Second problem : controls.  In the old NES games, the controls were very simple, very standard, and very ingrained in my mind.  The A button was for jumping, the B button for shooting.  Simple, yes?  That's how it always was.  That's how most NES games were set up, from Mario Bros. on.  A was  always  the jump button, and B was  always  the shoot button.  This is not the case on the Gamecube version of the Anniversary Collection.  No, here they are reversed, and we have the A button for shooting, and the B button for jumping.  That's all well and good, except most people who're like me and grew up playing the games with the controls the other way are confused as hell, and it's messing up my gameplay.  This wouldn't be such a problem if they'd included a button configuration option, but they didn't.  Those issues aside--the first being minor, the second being of rather greater importance and annoyance--I love the collection.  It's fun getting the chance to play all these old games again.  And they've added a few nice innovations that take advantage of the more advanced controllers available with the next generation consoles.  For instance, both versions have a button which allows you to do rapidfire (just hold the button down and you get constant fire, essentially) instead of having to tap the fire button as fast as you can.  You can still just tap the fire button, but the rapidfire button is rather reminiscent of having a turbo controller for the old NES (anyone remember those?  You had the smaller Maxx, and the big arcade joysticked thing, the Advantage.  Ah, good times).  They also set a button for the slide move (you usually do the slide by holding down and hitting the jump button, but that's sometimes difficult to manage).  Of course, the slide isn't activated until Mega Man 3 (the game in which the maneuver was introduced), but that's the way it ought to be.  You can also use the shoulder buttons (L and R) to cycle through your available weapons instead of having to go to your menu every time you want to switch weapons.  One of the other nice features is the addition of tons of unlockable bonus material, including a couple of never-before-available-in-the-US arcade games, Power Battle and Power Fighters.  There's also interviews with the creators of the Mega Man series, art galleries, and all sorts of stuff.  it's going to take forever just to beat the eight games, let alone unlock all the bonus material.  But that's alright by me.  Anyway, haven't had much of a chance to play it much yet, since I had to work all afternoon/evening.  Dunno how much time I'll have after work, either, since I think I'm supposed to hang out with Dom and Jess tonight.  Ah well.  Lots of time ahead, right?  I've started playing Final Fantasy Tactics Advance again.  I beat Sword of Mana the other day, and had the urge to go play back through Tactics again, since I loved it so much the first time (ended up logging over 75 hours the first time through).  Dunno how long it'll take this time.  Last time through, I tended to focus on one or two of the races, and completely neglected one of them (the lizard-like bangaas).  I think it's because I didn't care for most of the abilities that race had.  But this time, I'm making an effort to give them a shot, just 'cause I want to see what they can do.  Oh, I picked up Wilco's latest,  A Ghost is Born .  It's rather different from  Summer Teeth , the only other album I have by Wilco.  Very good, but rather quiet at times.  Not quite so many songs that just rock, and more that are subtle, melodic, and winding (there are two songs over 10 minutes on the album).  It's an album that's going to take a while to sink in, but I think will ultimately be worth the time spent coming to grips with it.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Wilco, "Theologians"

       "Born In The U.S.A."   I'm on a Scott Kurtz kick today (the past twenty-four hours, anyway, and I guess that was technically "today" when I posted that last one, wasn't it?).  He made an interesting comment in his news space today, and I thought I'd share my thoughts on the issue within it.  See, he was talking about this game called "City of Heroes."  It's one of those massively multiplayer online roleplaying games, kinda like Everquest, only not so tedious and with superheroes instead of swords'n'sorcery.  Anyway, seems Mr. Kurtz decided to create a character on the game similar to the Marvel superhero Captain America (if you don't know who Captain America is...well, I pity you).  Anyway, he comes up with this patriotic-based superhero, and takes him out into the game.  And people start verbally abusing him for having a patriotic-based character.  Kurtz was flabberghasted.  Folks were talking about how much they hate not only Bush, but America, as though the two were synonymous.  This rather upset and aggitated Kurtz, and brought up an interesting thing I hadn't really thought about much myself.  I am an American.  For better or worse, this was the country I was born in, and I kinda like it here.  I may not always agree with everything other Americans do, or how they behave, or our government's policies and decisions and things like that, but I'm not about to close shop and move to South Africa or anything.  I'm not going to say there isn't room for improvement--there obviously is in any place you go, and anyone who thinks this country is fine the way it is needs to seriously re-examine reality--but it's still a damn sight better than most of the places you could end up in throughout the world.  I'll admit that I don't like Bush at all.  I've yet to find anything about him that I do like, except for maybe the way he handled most of the immediate aftermath of 9/11.  I'm not entirely sure Gore could've done any better, to be honest.  However, that was almost three years ago, and really early in Bush's administration.  I don't think he's done a lot right since then, and I'm scared of the things he might do, though not directly to me (I am, after all, pretty much the sort of person they had in mind when they came up with the term "the majority": a white male Protestant, of Anglo-Saxon descent, middle-class from a traditional family).  But really, when you get down to it, this country's got a lot of things going for it, and a lot of possibilities to become a better place than it is.  I'm an optimist, and think this is one of the best countries in the world, if perhaps a bit arrogant and bullying sometimes.  Just for the record, I'm a fairly moderate person in pretty much everything, especially politics.  I'm not exceedingly liberal or exceedingly conservative, though I have bits and pieces in my philosophy that come from either side.  But I don't think patriotism needs to be co-opted like it has been by the right.  Bruce Springsteen wrote the song "Born in the USA" about disenfranchised and embittered Vietnam vets, and then Ronald Reagan tried to co-opt it as his campaign song--even though it was completely contrary to the message of the song for the conservative Reagan to use the song.  The Boss's response was then--as it was when he released his album  The Rising , which dealt with the aftereffects of 9/11 and the "war on terrorism"--that patriotism was something which the right had attempted to claim as its own, but that people of a more liberal or moderate perspective could still love their country while seeing that there was room for improvement in our attitudes.  And y'know, the Boss is right.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Bruce Springsteen, "Worlds Apart"

       "The Devil's Radio"   Today (well, yesterday now), I participated in a roleplaying game for the first time in quite a while (last summer was the last time, I think, or thereabouts).  There's three of us playing, and Ev is game mastering.  It looks like it'll be a fairly interesting game, with a fairly easy and intuitive game system that Ev cobbled together from three or four others.  I'm playing a philosopher thief who is better at convincing people to let him take their stuff than he is at just taking someone's stuff.  It'll be an amusing character to work with, I think.  I read something over at  urlLink PVP  that I found rather interesting, though the rant has since disappeared (and this is just in the last few minutes, mind you...I'd think I was slightly insane if I wasn't positive I just read the damn thing).  Scott Kurtz was talking about a guy who'd created a webcomic with characters startlingly similar in appearance to characters in Kurtz's own comic.  He'd apparently had communications back and forth with the guy drawing this other comic, and the other guy said something about how apparently Kurtz was afraid that someone with a similar style would be intimidated by this newcomer because he (the newcomer) had fresher ideas and something new to offer, while Kurtz was just rehashing the same schtick over and over.  Now, I'll be the first to admit that I've incorporated elements of other artists' styles into my own.  I've adapted things I liked--the way one guy draws hands, or another draws facial expressions, or whatever--and applied those things to the way I draw my own characters.  I don't lift whole characters or character designs just for shits and giggles, though, and then claim they're mine.  I think Scott Kurtz was completely justified in his annoyance and outright anger with this other guy's stuff, especially when the guy pretty much flat out  admitted  that he was lifting Kurtz's drawing style.  That's like saying you borrowed the tune from, say, the Beatles' "Yesterday," but then put slightly different words to it (that analogy probably tells you everything you need to know about my opinion on musical "sampling" in hip-hop and rap, but that's a rant for another time).  For me (and for Kurtz, I imagine), the issue here is not "who can make the best jokes using this art style," as the other guy seems to think it is, but rather an issue of intellectual property.  Those character designs are the product of Scott Kurtz, and someone else claiming them as his own (even if slightly modified, as these appear to be...though only very slightly), and not only that, but trying to make money off of those designs (the guy had a Paypal button with one of "his" images on it), is inexcusable.  It's one thing to have a similar style, but it's another to have the same character designs.  Scott Kurtz kind of has a reputation as a bit of an asshole, one which is probably drawn from his tendency to simply say what he thinks without filtering it through a "how would other people react to this?" filter.  Admittedly, that's not such a bad thing all the time--sometimes, we need folks to say what they believe before really thinking about it.  I may not always agree with his opinions, but I think Kurtz has the right to voice them, especially in his own webspace.  I also happen to think that he  is  in the right here, and that this other cartoonist is doing something which is unfair to Kurtz and not entirely honest.  This sort of thing can be taken too far in both directions, though.  Let someone do what they will with your art and your style, and you have no control over your own intellectual property.  But then there are guys who take even fair usage too seriously (there was an example of this being discussed over at  urlLink Penny Arcade  earlier this week and, prior to that, about two or three months ago...all involving the same idiot).  There's a fine line to tread between claiming something which is clearly based on someone else's work as your own, and using something fairly (as, say, a forum avatar...which was the case in the Penny Arcade incident I mentioned).  One is essentially stealing and not bothering to come up with original character designs.  The other is actually a completely different issue, though both perhaps deal with copyrights and the like.  All in all, I think I have to agree with Kurtz in this instance.  The other guy, from what I can gather (there was no link nor mention of the name of the offending comic, and I couldn't come up with anything in my search, so I can't actually verify much of what Kurtz was arguing except from the snippets of this other guy's art which Kurtz had to compare with his own work in the rant), is in the wrong here, and ought to have working a little harder at coming up with original characters.  Plagiarism is a serious offense, whether in writing or art or whatever.  As a writer myself, and as a scholar especially, I take that sort of thing seriously.  Intellectual property is very, very important, and with something like this art style and character design debacle, citing your source simply isn't enough.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Moxy Früvous, "Green Eggs and Ham"

       "But Nobody Can Sing The Blues Like Blind Willie McTell"   Some musicians have a difficult time recognizing their best songs.  Of the songs I have on my computer by the band Wilco, only about four of them are songs I've seen on their available CDs.  Dave Matthews (though I'm almost embarrassed to even admit I  listen  to him) shelved a highly anticipated album helmed by uber-producer Steve Lillywhite in favor of the mediocre material on  Everyday .  Throughout rock music's history, some guys just don't recognize when they've got a great song on their hands.  The most notorious of these musicians, though, is Bob Dylan.  He's one of the most prolific songwriters ever, churning out song after song and album after album.  Admittedly, some of these songs (and even albums--especially most anything from the late seventies and early eighties) are sub-par and sound like Zimmy was just going through the motions.  But if you dig deeper into Dylan's catalogue, you start coming across songs you've never heard, but that are at least as good as anything he did put on his actual albums, if not better.  The best example of Dylan's apparent inability to recognize a brilliant song when he writes it is the tune "Blind Willie McTell," which can be found on  The Bootleg Series, Vol. 1-3 .  It's a simple song--Dylan does vocals and plays piano, and Mark Knopfler (of Dire Straits fame) accompanies him on a softly strummed acoustic guitar.  But the simplicity of the arrangement--based on an old blues standard, "St. James Infirmary"--belies the song's purity and deceptive beauty.  Dylan turns in one of his absolute best vocal performances ever (I know, to some, that's not saying a whole lot, but trust me), and is evocative and emotive and stirring.  In the lyric, Dylan laments that there are no great blues singers--no Blind Willie McTell or Leadbelly or Blind Lemon--to sing about the woes and troubles the world is currently in.  There is no bluesman capable of expressing the pain of today's society, or of coming to terms with it.  "Blind Willie McTell" is a breathtaking, heartbreaking song, and Dylan wasn't happy with his performance and thought the song wouldn't fit on his album  Infidels , for which it was recorded.  A few listens to the song, though, make you scratch your head and wonder what Dylan was thinking.  He's done this to us several times, though, relegating absolutely marvelous tunes to relative obscurity by not placing them on proper albums, but rather leaving them to collect dust until someone finds them and collects them on a work such as  The Bootleg Series  or a rarities compliation.  Two other perfect examples spring to mind, both of which are found on Dylan's  Greatest Hits, Volume Two  (the only Dylan CD where either song appears)--"Tomorrow is Such a Long Time" and "When I Paint My Masterpiece."  Admittedly, "When I Paint My Masterpiece" isn't an obscure song by any means, nor is "Tomorrow is Such a Long Time," actually.  Both have been covered heavily by other bands.  But neither has ever appeared on a regular album, and "Masterpiece" is at least equal to the songs Dylan was putting on albums at the time (early '70s), and "Tomorrow" is a beautiful, simple acoustic song from very early in his career ('62 or '63, I think) that happened to be recorded live at one of his shows.  It seems, given the number of covers of both of these songs, that other musicians are better able to spot superior Dylan songs than Dylan himself sometimes.  My Dylan obsession is fairly obvious, as it has been for a while now.  I started really listening to his stuff only about four years ago, and his visuals and stories struck me in a way that few other musicians have ever done.  When I started really listening to his work, getting beyond his voice or even the instrumentation, and looked at what he was saying and how he was saying it, I suddenly realized I, like Adam Duritz of the Counting Crows, "want to be Bob Dylan."  If I were to ever become a musician, I'd want to be a musician like Dylan, someone who played and wrote the music he wanted to, who defied understanding in many cases, and who wrote amazing songs.  I want to write amazing songs.  I want to be able to write something like "Blind Willie McTell," and be such a good songwriter that I barely even recognize that a song I consider a throwaway is actually absolutely brilliant.  I want to be Bob Dylan.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Bob Dlyan, "Blind Willie McTell" (who didn't see that coming?)

       "It's Just A Dream He Keeps Having"   Jess and Dominic are back in town already.  I know this because Jess called me up at 7.00 am this morning to ask for her car keys (as I had both of the car keys to the Sunfire.  See, Beth had just driven the Sunfire back to Norman after the wedding, as Jess and Dom were going to Shawnee for the night in the truck.  Then they gave me a set of keys for the house--Jessica's keys, as it turns out, which had the other key to the Sunfire on it.  So I ended up with both keys).  So I went over and gave her the keys so she could go to work this morning.  Turns out they got back around midnight Saturday/Sunday, and actually came over to the house on Sunday morning (I noticed when I went over yesterday morning that the truck was missing and that lights were on in the house which I had never turned on).  So yeah, they're back, and that's groovy and all.  For me, it means no more having to keep track of the cats.  It also means that many more people to hang out with now, which is nice.  It's been getting too quiet around here.  Ev wants me to join a roleplaying game he's starting Wednesday.  I'm gonna give it a shot, 'cause it could be a lot of fun and a nice distraction from other stuff.  Plus, Ev's a rather creative game master, to put it mildly (it's like saying the Beatles were a decent little band, or that the mobsters in the  Godfather  movies had an interesting way of doing business).  I've been listening to a lot of Americana lately.  What's that, you ask?  Well, it's rather hard to describe as a genre.  It's rather like alternative country, though not as heavily influenced by punk.  Americana is a weird fusion of country, folk, blues, rock, and bluegrass, with even a bit of gospel thrown in for good measure.  As a musical form, it was really defined by Bob Dylan and the Band on  The Basement Tapes , a collection of demos and song ideas that moved through American musical genres like ducks through water.  The thematic content of Americana deals with love, both requited and unrequited, as do most songs in contemporary music (by contemporary I basically mean anything that's not classical, opera, or musical soundtrack.  Pop music, basically).  But more often, Americana deals with crafting a mythology of America.  The Band--though four of the five members were Canadian--was masterful at this, with such songs as "The Weight" and "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down."  Americana conjures images of times gone by; of what used to be, for better or ill.  Contemporary Americana doesn't focus on this mythology-making as much, though it does draw from it and from that tradition.  The line between Americana and alternative country is fuzzy at best, and many bands could fall into one or both categories quite easily.  Groups such as the Old 97s, Wilco, and Whiskeytown exemplify the best that contemporary Americana has to offer.  I think the reason I like the style so much is that it's so hard to define.  Since Americana incorporates elements from so many different musical traditions, it's hard to pin it down.  Americana is more of a metagenre, like Rock and Roll (it's hard to think of hard rockers like Led Zeppelin and singer/songwriters like James Taylor as being in the same genre, but putting them in the same broad metagenre works).  This ambiguity is one of the strengths of Americana--bands aren't tied down to one specific style, but can move fluidly from one style to the next, incoporating it all into one broader form.  The genre's other strength is that it tends to retain some of the rough edges in the music.  While the albums may have a warm, inviting sound and feel, there are still a few ragged spots in the sound, allowing the music to retain that warmth and a sense of immediacy and energy.  It's not too slick or over-produced, something that a lot of contemporary music--no matter the genre--seems to suffer from.  Don't get me wrong--sometimes, I'm in favor of slick music, too, but most of the time, I'd rather get something that hasn't smoothed over every little quirk in the music.  It's those quirks that give the music personality.  Not to put to fine a point on it, I actually think Cross-Eyed Yeti would basically fall into this meta-genre.  Clif and I genre-hop all the time, one minute playing a straight-ahead blues or boogie song, the next playing a country-rock song, and then switching it up to roots-rock.  Styles and genres aren't supposed to confine a band, but to allow them to stretch out and explore possibilities.  That's what most artists in the Americana metagenre are doing.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Wilco, "Summer Teeth"

       "When I Paint My Masterpiece"   Y'know, the more I think about it, the more I really want to be a professional writer or cartoonist.  I'd love to make a living telling stories, whether in short story, novel, or comic format.  I really am just a storyteller at heart.  That's part of why I love history so much--there are so many stories in there, buried behind politics and names and dates.  I really need to get off my ass and finish some stuff.  Several stories, for instance.  My damned Master's Thesis.  Chapter Three of Troubled Times.  The reworked Yellowstone Saga.  Guest comics for various webcomics.  Etcetera, etcetera.  I've been damned lazy of late, and I don't really know why.  Guess there's been no one immediate to encourage, cajole, and otherwise coerce me into action.  I need some sort of structure.  Blah.  Going home tomorrow afternoon for Father's Day.  Dunno what's being cooked for us to eat yet, but I'm sure it'll be better than whatever I'd prepare for myself otherwise.  Besides, I'll get leftovers and get to go grocery shopping while I'm home, and those're very good things.  On another note, the Mega Man Anniversary Collection is coming out on Tuesday.  What's that, you ask?  Well, it's all eight of the original Mega Man games (the first six were for the original Nintendo, number seven was for the Super Nintendo, and number eight appeared on the Playstation) together with two arcade Mega Man games--Power Fighters and Power Battle (fighting games using Mega Man characters)--all on one disc for both the Gamecube and the Playstation Two.  My youngest brother, Scott, is a Mega Man  fanatic , and has been anticipating the release of this game since it was announced sometime late last year.  He's got all eight individual games (actually, come to think of it, the only Mega Man games he doesn't own are ones which were never released here in the United States), but he'll be getting the Anniversary Collection for the PS2 this week because he wants them all conveniently on one disc along with the two arcade games and the load of extra stuff coming with the collection.  I'll be getting the Gamecube version myself (since that's what I have), partly so Scott and I can compare the extra material (each one supposedly has different bonus stuff) and because I dig Mega Man myself, though not nearly with the same devotion as my sibling.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Bob Dylan, "Tomorrow is a Long Time"

       "There's A Magazine Called Sunset"   Internet was out this morning at the apartment.  Something about the network for Parkview (my complex) was just really messed up, or so I discovered after half an hour on the phone with IT.  But it was back up again this afternoon, so I was able to get all of tomorrow's comic stuff uploaded to the Dim Bulb server in time for the 1 year anniversary.  So last night, I found a link to a rather interesting contest.  Seems you submit a short story to the people, and if you win, they turn your story into (1) an off-Broadway play and (2) an 80 page graphic novel.  The possibility of having a group of artists turn one of my short stories into a graphic novel was pretty damn compelling, I have to say, so I decided to submit a story last night.  The final decision will be made sometime middle of next month, so I'll be sure to let everyone know how that turns out.  I also--after noting that Dav has sent some stories off for possible publication--want to try and get a few of my stories published.  Dunno yet what all is involved in getting something published, or even if I've got anything worth publishing, but hey, I've received enough rejection letters from grad schools.  Rejection letters from publishers can't be worse, right?  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Wilco, "Someday Soon"

       "Them's Got Ears, Let Them Hear"   So yeah, when it rains, it pours.  Earlier this week, I was complaining about feeling trapped and wanting to go somewhere, anywhere.  Well, I keep forgetting that other people read this damn thing.  Wendy (though she doesn't read it, I don't think) wanted me to come visit her to see Glen Phillips and Nickel Creek in Alexandria (where she lives, coincidentally).  And just yesterday, Dav emails me wanting to know if I want to join him in Chicago for Wizard World.  And of course, let us not forget that I am going with Jessica and Dominic to take Beth to Florida.  Now, guess what?  All three of these things occur on  exactly  the same weekend.  Granted, I'm already committed to helping Beth move.  Means I had to turn down the other two offers, which were very attractive.  I still do want to visit Wen, and Dav's a blast to hang out with (I think I need to arrange a get-together with several of my friends of the geek persuasion sometime, just for the hell of it.  The concentration of geekiness could well make the world implode).  And it'd be fun--gaming, movies, and...um...more gaming, probably.  Anyway, I'm gonna go watch  Return of the King  now.  I bought it right when it came out on DVD last month, thinking I'd be able to have a  LOTR  marathon with Jess, Dom, and Beth.  Yeah, three guess as to how well  that  worked out.  But I'll have the last laugh--I'm gonna watch it now!  Mwahahahaha!  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Wilco, "I am trying to break your heart"

       "What's My Line?  I'm Happy Cleaning Windows"   I've noticed something I find rather amusing.  Most of my posts in this thing come when I'm at work, sitting around with nothing to do or lots on my mind (those two things often coincide, I've noticed).  For those who are interested, I have a guest comic up over at  urlLink Shadow Dragon Executive Force , a nifty comic done by Jops.  Jops linked us ages ago, round about the time I promised him a guest strip in exchange for a link (though he maintains he linked us not because of any bargain, but because he genuinely likes our work).  Anyway, it took me ages to actually come up with anything worthwhile, and he turns right around and posts it before I even have a chance to wake up this morning (I only sent it to him late last night).  Go give that a looksee if you want.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Van Morrison, "Cleaning Windows"

       "Are You Ready For The Country?"   Well, Clyde turns 21 today.  Kinda hard to believe my baby brother's that old.  Hard to believe the youngest one turns twenty next April.  It's starting to make me feel kinda old, y'know?  I'm starting to feel restless again.  I want to go somewhere, be somewhere else.  Anywhere but here.  Dunno how I'd get there, or what I'd do when I got there, or how I'd afford to take a road trip at this point, but I have the urge to leave this town and not return for a while.  I'll probably just go home and play video games instead, though.  I've already got those.  In other news, I'm hungry, 'cause I haven't eaten yet today, and I've been awake since 9.00 am.  Good thing I get off work in half an hour.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Neil Young, "Are you ready for the country?"

       "Two Dollar Pistol But The Gun Won't Shoot"   The internet in my apartment has been sporadically connected at best for the better part of the past week.  I think it has something to do with all the rain we've been having--this area of the University was built decades ago (we're talking World War II era), and not much about it has been updated since then.  The fact that I even  have  internet access in my apartment sometimes astounds me, to be honest.  But for some reason, whenever we have really heavy rain for a prolonged period of time (as we have most of this past week), it makes the connection go wonky.  It's almost as bad at work over in the stadium, a scant couple of blocks away from my apartment.  the wiring over there is really old, too, and they're not only prone to having internet trouble in heavy rain, but to having electrical outages at the drop of a raindrop.  At least my place isn't quite that bad.  Anyway, the internet problem means I've had trouble staying connected for more than a few minutes at a time during the worst periods, and for even an hour or so when it's not quite as bad.  It's made MSN Messenger especially touchy, and since several of the people I talk to on a daily basis use that program, it means that I'll be in the middle of a conversation, and suddenly I'll get booted.  or I'll be trying to load up my email or something, and it won't load.  Stuff should load on this computer (and this network) nigh instantaneously, but I'm lucky right now if it loads at all.  Blarg.  Got to talk to Amanda E. earlier this afternoon, which was nice.  Haven't had a good, long conversation with her in much too long, probably since the last time I was at Ozarks (back in February, that was).  I'm probably going to go visit her before Heather's wedding at the end of July, since I have the two or three days prior to that wedding off from work.  In completely unrelated news, Dim Bulb Comics turns 1 on Friday, and my brother Clif turns 21 tomorrow.  Hard to believe Adam and I have been doing the website that long, or that we have as many readers as we do (at the same time, sometimes I feel we don't have anywhere near as many readers as we should have or deserve, but that's a rant that's already been made).  Equally hard to believe that my middle brother will be legally able to drink tomorrow.  Not that he will.  Clif's one of the most straight-laced people I know.  I mean, you think I'm boring when it comes to alcohol and things of that nature...Clif's even more so.  Scott's about the same.  We're boring young adults, y'know?  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Tom Waits, "Jockey Full of Bourbon"

       "If I Could Go On Sleeping"   It's entirely too warm in the back bedroom of my apartment.  I know it's the room furthest from the air conditioner unit in the living room, but with windows shut and blinds closed and the fact that the sun went down well over five hours ago, you'd think it would cool off at least a bit.  Granted, the easy solution would be to simply not come into this room.  Sadly, it is the one which houses the computer.  Sometimes I think I should have set up this apartment differently.  Then again, that would mean my bedroom would have been in this room, and that would making sleeping in the summer rather difficult.  I hate heat.  So one of my coworkers is getting ready for a trip to England to visit her beau.  Depending on that trip, she might even being moving there permanently.  To say that I'm jealous would be a gross understatement.  I really do need to find a way to get myself to that country on some sort of permanent basis.  I'm willing to be an expatriot.  I'm willing to be made fun of for my accent.  Hell, I'm even willing to deal with British food.  Part of me thinks I'm so enamoured of England and all things British because they're not Oklahoma.  There are days when I truly hate living here, to be honest.  I cannot stand this state for much longer.  On the other hand, part of me is, I have to admit, loathe to leave this place.  The great majority of my family--and all of my immediate family--live here.  It would be (and will be) hard to live far away from my parents, grandparents, and siblings.  Everett has remarked on several occasions how odd it is to him that I'm so close to my family, and really, I'm not even as close to mine as some people I know are to theirs.  I know that I'd be able to live far away from them, and even deal with not being able to see them more than a couple of times a year.  But part of me would miss them greatly.  I may hate Oklahoma, but I also love it, in a strange way, because my family is intimately tied up with this state in my mind.  And it's kind of strange to me to have that love/hate relationship with this place.  Part of me desperately needs and wants to be free of Oklahoma, but another part of me also realizes I'll always carry this state with me in my mind and my attitudes.  Everett commented earlier that, in many ways, I'm a small-town, conventional individual who is very comfortable in the midwest.  And that's pretty true.  When they were looking to craft a definition of the average midwesterner, I think they probably had me in mind, or at least were thinking of someone quite like me.  That being said, I still want to go to England.  Maybe I can still try to get my PhD from there.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Eagles, "Best of my Love"

       "Take A Load For Free"   Spent a quiet evening at the apartment last night.  It really has been quiet and empty there since Beth left, though I keep finding long hairs of hers all over the place (there was one in the shower today, even).  I miss having her around to hang out with, but my wallet is significantly fuller now that she's gone, which is probably for the best at this point.  Paid for summer tuition today.  That was...loads of fun.  Really.  Personally, I think I've given this damn school more money than they deserve already.  But I digress.  One thing I meant to talk about when I reviewed the Clapton concert yesterday was the opening act.  It was this combo called Robert Randolph and the Family Band.  Robert Randolph is a guitarist...well, I say "guitarist," but he doesn't play guitar in the way you think he does.  He plays a pedal steel guitar, but he plays it like a man possessed.  His act had more energy and high-octaine guitar work than damn-near anyone I've ever heard.  That man could  play , and soloed on the steel guitar like Jimi Hendrix crossed with Mark Knopfler.  I half expected to see smoke pouring off of his fingertips.  They were a phenomenal band, and I'm actually looking around for one of their albums now (Best Buy here in Norman actually has both of them...now it's just a matter of determining which one I want).  Randolph himself came back out during Clapton's encores to join him for a number, and you had Clapton, Randolph, and Clapton's other guitarist taking turns trading 12 bars of soloing for like five minutes.   Damn , it was impressive.  Anyone ever heard of a musical called  Avenue Q ?  Everett wants me to hear the soundtrack tomorrow, but I'm almost a little afraid to hear it.  But I'm also curious.  Just not bi-curious.  Okay, no more gay jokes, honest.  I only use them when I'm around him, because (being bisexual himself), he finds them funny as hell.  And so do I, now that I think about it.  I'm probably also using them as a way to deal with my own homophobia, which isn't nearly as bad as it was, say, even a few years ago.  What any of that had to do with anything else I've been talking about, I have no idea.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Bob Dylan & The Band, "Tears of Rage"

       "Before They Bring The Curtain Down"   Well, the easiest way to sum up the Eric Clapton concert last night is in one word: wow.  I admit, when I first decided I wanted to see Clapton, I was also a wee bit skeptical.  I've heard a lot of his '90s material, and it was...well, it was crap.  He decided to go with some adult contemporary/R&B/pop crap that didn't even have guitar solos in it, and sometimes didn't even have guitars.  Part of the blame rests with the otherwise phenomenal  Unplugged  album he did in the early '90s.  The acoustic show wasn't really pop in and of itself--it featured several very good acoustic blues songs--but its two biggest hits, "Tears in Heaven" and a completely reworked and much slower "Layla"--sort of laid the foundation.  His next big hit was the single "Change the World," another mostly acoustic number that really leaned heavily towards the adult contemporary style.  Then he put out the album  Pilgrim , which featured heavy drum loops, synths, and a load of rubbish songs.  In short, Clapton hit a slump in the mid- to late-90s that he's finally starting to pull out of.  Clapton's most recent offering,  Me and Mr. Johnson , is a set of acoustic blues covers originally done by bluesman Robert Johnson.  It's a great album, or the songs I heard from it last night were great.  And that's the sort of thing we received all night last night--great rock and blues songs.  Clapton put away all of his '90s crap (with the exception of a couple of cuts from  Me and Mr. Johnson  and a cut or two from the decent  Reptile ), and played nothing newer than the song "Wonderful Tonight."  All the rest were old standards, great numbers with loads of killer guitar and piano/organ work.  Clapton's soloing--and there was a hell of a lot of soloing in those two plus hours--was spot-on, fast as lightning, and as sharp as anything he's done in his entire career.  The music sounded fresh, immediate, and heartfelt, as though Clapton were actually enjoying himself up there on stage instead of just going through the motions (as he sounded on the live album from his last tour,  One More Car, One More Driver , a bland, blah record with very little to recommend it).  And he wasn't the only one--his backing band had energy, chops, and enthusiasm to spare.  And Clapton wasn't the only one up there soloing--the second guitarist could hold his own pretty well, and had several opportunities to cut loose with very tight, precise solos that fit that spot in the particular song perfectly.  The pianist was just the sort you'd expect for a great blues/jazz jam band, with speed, precision, and just enough fluidity and improvisation to keep it interesting.  And the organist was none other than Billy Preston, the guy who played keyboards on the Beatles'  Let It Be .  And let me tell you, Mr. Preston was no slouch, either--at one point, he was actually playing the organ with his  knees .  All in all, the Clapton concert was one of the most rewarding live musical experiences I've had in a long time, probably the most rewarding since the first time I saw Tom Petty back in like 1991-92 or so.  Clapton kept up the energy, the audience interaction, and the rockin' music the whole night, never letting up even for a minute.  He opened the show with a smirk, playing the song "Let it Rain" (which is what it had been doing all freakin' day long in Oklahoma), and just kept going for the next two and some hours.  And when he broke into "Layla" near the end of the show--the real "Layla," not the acoustic version--there wasn't a person in the audience who wasn't singing along at the top of their lungs.  It was magic.  It was the blues.  I see why they scrawled "Clapton is God" on subway walls in London in the late '60s.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Eric Clapton, "Let it Rain"

So on a whim, I was glancing through the Keenspace Guide a while ago, just to see who was in the top 25 and, because I'm a curious little sod, where Dim Bulb Comics fell in the grand scheme of things.  I probably shouldn't have done this.  I hadn't heard of at least half of the top 25 comics.  I only knew about a third of the top 50.  Turns out Dim Bulb is sittin' pretty in the top 200 (round about 175 or so, I think), which isn't too bad, all things considered.  But a glance at several of the comics that're ahead of us kind of annoyed me.  Not so much because I didn't recognize many of them.  No, I'm more than willing to accept that there are popular comics out there I've never read.  I know Elf Only Inn, one of the most popular Keenspace comics, was getting 25% of all Keenspace page views a month or two back (which is damn impressive), and has just been tapped by big brother Keenspot.  I've never read the comic.  No, what annoyed me was the number of  sprite comics  that are apparently more popular than Dim Bulb.  I'll admit--there are a couple of sprite comics--8 Bit Theatre and Bob & George, to be precise--that I read regularly.  I read 8 Bit because it's damn funny and exceeds the limitations of the sprites through the writing and characterization.  I can forgive poor art or using sprites if the writing makes up for it.  Bob and George is really mostly just a habit, because I know the guy who does that one established the time-worn tradition of Mega Man sprite comics ("I want to make a comic, and it's gonna be great!  I'll retell the story of the Mega Man games, only the characters will be really stupid or really funny somehow!  It's the most original idea EVAR!!!!!11111  And they'll all speak in l33t, because l33t is teh funny!").  But Bob and George even occasionally makes me chuckle, so it's acceptable.  But I've seen some of these sprite comics.  They're awful.  One of the ones that's ahead of us even proclaims it's complete lack of originality  by referring to itself as a Bob and George Rip Off.  Now, I'll admit that the idea of a comic based on a couple of college roommates and their wacky hijinks isn't the most original comic idea ever either, but a quick look at my comic would reveal that I've strayed a bit from the formula by adding characters like Tim and Earl into the mix.  There's an element in my comics that does not exist in your average "real-life college kids, only with wacky stuff thrown in" comic.  That, and I'm actually funny (not always, but 9 times out of 10, it's a pretty solid bet that my comic would be humorous).  And the writing.  I like to think I come up with pretty good stories and that my characters are believable within the constraints of the world I've created for them.  You couldn't have someone like Tim running around in the real world, but I'll be the first to admit that the world in which Crooked Halo exists is not the same world as this one.  A parallel world, perhaps, where things are nearly the same, but not the "real world."  The kicker, though, is that at least I'm drawing something, dammit, and not just recoloring Mega Man sprites and claiming them as "artwork."  It seems petty and elitist and conceited, but there it is.  I can handle those guys who come up with their own sprites (such as the guy who does  urlLink Diesel Sweeties , which is another comic where the writing is excellent and far exceeds the art).  That takes talent, patience, and creativity.  If you want to tell a story, but don't have artistic ability, then be a  writer .  That's what writers do--they tell stories!  You don't  have  to have a comic to tell a story, y'know.  And for the people vapid enough to actually read these steaming piles of bull honkey, go read a real comic, why don't you?  The previous statement was brought to you by bitterness and bile.  Bitterness and bile--making swallowing your pride all the more difficult since 1980.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Tom Lehrer, "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park"

       "I Seem To Recognize Your Face"   So a strange thing happened yesterday when I was at the tux shop returning the tuxedoes from Jess & Dom's wedding.  See, I was in the shop with Jessica's parents (who'd come down to Norman to help me sort all the tuxes out and figure out if we were missing anything and cover the charges if we were missing anything), and the girl working at the shop suddenly stops what she's doing and stares at me.  "I get the feeling I know you," she says.  "You look familiar."  Now I have to admit, random attractive blondes saying they think they know me is a bit of an unusual occurance, so I'm curious about this, 'cause I know I don't recognize her.  She asks me where I'm from, but the bustling metropolis of Shawnee, Oklahoma rings no bells.  She asks me if I was ever involved in any yearbook stuff or anything like that.  I told her no, but I do comics for the OU paper.  Again, no sign of recognition.  She even asks me if I'd ever played baseball; I chuckled, because I haven't played baseball since I was like six years old.  Eventually, we just decide I must have a face that looks similar to someone else she knows, 'cause I'll be damned if I actually even know who this girl is.  In hindsight, perhaps we should have asked each other for our names.  That might've caused some sort of flicker of recognition.  The other possibility is that I'm actually famous in Norman, Oklahoma, and don't even know it.  I could be a celebrity.  If anyone wants my autograph, I'd be more than happy to oblige...as long as you're not wanting it on a bill or a confession or something.  That probably wouldn't work for me.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Charlie Biddle Trio, "They All Laughed"

       "She Gave A Smile But I Was Shy And I Looked Down--So Down"   So it turns out my money woes aren't nearly as woeful as I assumed them to be.  For starters, Jess and Dom paid me more than I thought they were going to for watching their cats.  Part of me is annoyed by this--the amount they gave me was the amount I initially refused, telling them it was way too much.  But I'm just gonna accept it, and take them out for dinner sometime after they get back and I've got enough cash to do so.  Second, when I go home Wednesday for the Eric Clapton concert (wooo!), mom's going to do my laundry, take me shopping (for groceries and various and sundry necessaries), and fill my car up with gas.  Third, it turns out I have a lot more money in my savings account than I thought I did, due to two facts: (1) I couldn't actually remember how much was in my account, and (2) my parents took the money from when we sold my old car to Jess & Dom and, instead of keeping it as I'd assumed they would (since they just gave me mom's old car gratis, and I thought we'd decided they were going to use the money from the sale of my car as a down payment for mom's new vehicle), they deposited it in my account.  So I've pretty good on cash.  Mom's going to deposit another $700 or so in my checking account later this week for me to use to pay tuition for the summer and to pay rent in July.  So things aren't nearly as bad as I'd thought.  I still need to work on my money management, but at least I have some money to manage now.  In other news, I helped Jessica's parents haul all the tuxedos back to the tux shop this afternoon.  I think we actually managed to get everything returned without losing anything, which was an impressive feat.  That was basically the afternoon's activity, aside from writing some lyrics down for a bluesy tune while waiting for her parents to show up.  I'll maybe post 'em here or over at the Livejournal later.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Wilco, "No Poetry"

       "Via Con Dios"   Well, the wedding of Jessica and Dominic occurred this past Saturday.  It was a good day--rather hectic, with last minute things to do, wonky sound (not my fault--stupid stereo didn't want to cooperate round about 11.30), and the officiant not remembering that we had a microphone up by the podium for him to speak in to so we could actually hear the service (then again, even when they did remember the microphone, the sound system wasn't turned up loud enough for it to have been much use).  All in all, though, it was a great time, and the wedding turned out beautifully.  Also got to meet several of Dominic's friends from back east.  His best man, a guy named John, was a real good guy; very warm and friendly.  John took me aside yesterday at a brunch (given for Dominic's mother's 50th birthday party), and told me if I was ever in Boston and needed a place to stay, I had one.  Thought that was rather cool.  The wedding itself was full of strange, amusingly surreal moments.  The little kids had possession of the dance floor throughout dinner, though we eventually won it back in a series of engagements and offerings of candy.  At around 12.00 or so, we had stereo troubles, but eventually got it to play again.  When the song "Glory Days," by Bruce Springsteen, came up, the wedding party--all the groomsmen, the bride and groom, and myself--all started singing along at the top of our lungs.  The few other people remaining (including Beth) probably thought we were insane, especially when we did it again less than an hour later.  Towards the end of the night, most of us (that is, the groomsmen, the bride and groom, and myself) had a shot of tequila with Mom Bowie (that is, Jessica's mom...I've called her Mom Bowie since high school, because the woman was like a second mother to us all back then, and she just emanates a cool mom vibe).  That was kinda funny--were I to try and even have a beer with my mom, she'd spend the whole time scowling.  But anyway, the weekend was a blast, though I'm still sore from standing, dancing, and squatting down on the floor for seven hours straight.  So now Jess and Dom have left for Ireland, and Beth has left for Rochester.  I took Beth to the airport yesterday afternoon after the brunch to celebrate Dom's mother's birthday.  I don't think it's really set in yet that Beth has gone, and that I won't see her until August, and then only briefly.  When it does set in, I'll probably be depressed, but that's just how this sort of thing goes, y'know?  Guess I hadn't really realized how much that girl was a part of my life, even if it's really only been since about Thanksgiving that that's been the case.  You just get used to people being there, get to used to having them around to talk to, laugh with, and bounce ideas around with.  You get used to a presence, and I got used to hers.  I wouldn't go so far as to say I fell in love with her, except in so far as I love all of my friends dearly.  But I will definitely miss her being around.  There's going to be a Beth-shaped gap in my life for quite a while, I think.  There's a Spanish phrase-- via con Dios .  It means "go with God."  It's something you say to those who are departing, who are leaving your presence for the time being.  We don't really have any equivalent phrase in the English language that we use with regularity as a greeting or farewell.   Godspeed , perhaps, though that's not used much anymore.  That's why I like  via con Dios .  It's still used, and it is a very powerful phrase.  Wherever you go, go with God's grace and protection.  I like that sort of sentiment.  Go with God.   Via con Dios , my friends.  ~chuck cottrell  Song of the Moment: Bruce Springsteen, "Glory Days"

       "There Is Nothing That Doesn't Matter"   Hey folks.  Odd time for posting, I'm sure, but there's crap on my mind, and it must be written down before I burst.  First, I'm worried as hell about money.  I reconciled my checkbook this evening, and I have $125 to my name.  That's it.  Thankfully, I've paid rent for this month, but I'll have rent again in July, and as of right now, I'm looking at six to nine hours per week at work for the next month and a half.  That's, as we say in the business, really really bad.  I haven't ever really had to worry about money.  As a high school student, I didn't have to work part-time jobs to support myself or pay for my car or anything.  My folks took care of all of it.  When I got into college, it was much the same--I had scholarships covering most of my school costs, and my folks covered the rest.  I worked a bit for the school, but the money I made at the Learning Center was basically pocket money for whatever I wanted to spend it on, which was usually CDs.  I worked during the summers, earning a good amount of money, which I'd use during the school year to live on (for eating out, laundry, gas, whatever).  Graduate school has been a bit different.  My folks have still been helping me out, but I have to pay for my rent and food and such.  And the money my parents had saved up for me to attend school is now...gone.  I've spent it all getting these--currently--absolutely worthless degrees.  I have a BA and almost an MA in History, and they aren't getting me all that much closer to achieving my goal of being a college professor.  I say that because I still haven't managed to get accepted to a graduate school.  What good is a BA or an MA if they don't get me into a PhD program?  I can't really do a whole lot with what I've got.  But I digress.  Money issues.  Not working enough, too many expenses, rent goes up next month to an as-yet unknown amount (I'm guessing it'll be about $475).  I guess I have a few options...  (1) Quit school, move back home, get a job flippin' burgers or sackin' groceries. (2) Sell plasma, my kidney, extra crap I've got, my very soul to save up enough cash to survive the summer. (3) Get an extra part-time job, something nigh-impossible to do in Norman in the summer (though possibly manageable...if I want to go into fast food or retail.  Ugh). (4) Ask folks for money.  None of these are guaranteed sources of good income.  The first option has the obvious flaws.  The second is difficult because I really don't have all that much that'd be worth anything, or that I'd be willing to part with.  The third...is doable, though not something I'd relish.  I don't want to have to have another job, I just want to be able to get enough hours with the job I already have to not have to worry about money.  The fourth...well, the biggest problem with the fourth is that I don't know that my parents will give me money anymore.  I think my father's fed up with the fact that I'm taking as long as I am with my degrees, and I think that both he and my mother are a little upset (and, admittedly, understandably so) with my spending habits of late: they've been, in truth, rather lavish for someone with such a weak income.  I've been spending way more than I need to on crap I didn't need to spend it on, and I know it.  I've behaved very poorly with my money.  I've no head for budgeting, but something tells me I'm going to have to learn how to budget real fast, or I'm gonna be up shit creek without the proverbial paddle.  It's also really just starting to hit me how alone I'm gonna be at the end of the week.  Sure, Jess and Dom will be coming back in a couple of weeks, but Beth'll be gone.  And it's really just occurring to me how much time I spend with that girl.  We hang out a lot.  Almost every day, really, even before she started crashing at my place last weekend.  I've come to depend on her company, not for some deep intellectual conversation (though we do have those) or the "you're the person who completes me" sort of thing, but just to be there to do things with, to hang out with.  She is a presence, a person who is there often and willingly.  I'll miss that, and I'll miss her, because I have no idea how often I'll see her--if ever--after we move her down to Florida in August.  And that's hard to deal with.  So yeah, it seems there's a lot on my plate right now.  I'm sure I'll get through somehow--I have thusfar, and so I have every expectation of coming out of this a better and stronger person than I was before.  I'm already working on ways to to improve my situation.  We'll just have to see what I can manage.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: David Gray, "Babylon II"

       "The Real Folk Blues"   It's been an interesting week, to say the least.  Hanging out with Beth's been fun, but I'm glad her crashing at my place isn't permanent.  I never get anything done.  I've been really damn lazy all week, got next to nothing accomplished, and I only feel slightly guilty about that.  I have gotten a few things accomplished--I took care of that overdue Interlibrary Loan book (turns out I  did  still have it--it was buried under a stack of papers).  Emailed Ohio State (still waiting for a reply back).  Conversed with a guy from Louisville Presbyterian Seminary about the possibility of me attending there and whatnot (they have spring admission!  I may go there in the spring).  Mostly, I've been watching lots of anime (Beth and I have gone through all of  Sorcerer Hunters ,  Blue Seed ,  Trigun , and  Cowboy Bebop  in the past two weeks), playing a significant amount of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles (we're almost done), and helping Jessica and Dominic prepare for their wedding.  They're nearly ready--just a few odds and ends to get taken care of, and we're set.  Got all the sound stuff figured out (it'll actually be quite easy), got all but one of the CDs made, the girls are making the cakes tomorrow during the day, and we've got most of the out-of-town guests figured out and in town already.  Things are progressing.  Today was interesting for other reasons as well.  Beth and I went up to OKC with Dominic this afternoon in the Sunfire (my old car).  It was weird riding in the passenger seat of a car I drove for almost six years.  It was even stranger riding in the backseat of said car.  And it was stranger  still  driving it back to Norman while Dominic rode with his father in said father's rental car.  But fun, in a strange way.  Beth pointed out something interesting on that drive, too--there was a good chance that August would be the last time she'd ever come to Oklahoma.  If Jessica & Dominic and I leave soon--as we're all hoping to do, really--then she'll have no reason to return to this state.  In a way, I'm hoping August  is  the last time she has to come here.  That means we're all out of this place finally.  There's so much I could say, but so very little of it is actually important enough to mention.  I miss many of my Ozarks friends right now, more than ever, and the idea that three of the four people I spend time with here in Norman are leaving on Sunday (Jess & Dom for their two-week honeymoon, Beth for the summer) is really starting to sink in and leave me with a big vacant feeling in the pit of my stomach.  But there's really not much I can do about it, y'know?  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Yoko Kanno & The Seatbelts, "Call Me, Call Me"

       Sweet, Sweet High-Speed Internet Access   Here's an update on my current Arkansian activities...  Ended up not leaving Shawnee until Friday, 'cause Amanda Erisman is better at planning and thinking things over than I am.  I'm currently at Heather's parents' house, printing up programs for her wedding tomorrow.  25 or so done, 125 or so to go.  It may be a bit of a long night.  It's good seeing my friends and being around them.  I'm finally going to be able to get a school notebook back that I loned to a friend of mine three or four years ago.  This is good, since they are notes from my Early Modern European History class.  Speaking of history, I finally got an email from my advisor today, and things look favorable.  He said there are still some revisions which need to be made, but they're "mostly cosmetic" (direct quote).  This makes me quite happy.  What doesn't make me happy is that he's out of town until August 16th.  Argh.  Looks like I'll still be a freakin' Master's student in the Fall...which is annoying, since it was probably only my own laziness which prevented me from completing this on time...that, and my advisor losing my email address  and  the copy of the Thesis I emailed to him.  Ah well.  Anyway, I need to fold more wedding programs.  More reports as they become available and I have internet access.  Oh, and while I remember--I had a guest comic up over at  urlLink Digital War .  Go lookie.  I rather liked it, and War went and linked us 'cause of it.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Old 97's, "The Streets of Where I'm From"

       "These Be Seven Curses On The Judge So Cruel"   It's Thursday night, and I'm still in Shawnee, OK.&nbsp; My plans have changed just a wee bit, but I think it's for the better.&nbsp; See, originally I was going to go visit my friend Amanda E. today.&nbsp; But she pointed out that her current location (northern Arkansas) is a hella long drive from here, and a hella long drive to El Dorado, AR, where I need to be tomorrow afternoon for the wedding rehersal.&nbsp; So Amanda and I are just going to get together sometime next week instead, when she's done with work and I don't have a dozen different places to be and times to be there.&nbsp; All I can say is that it's a good thing  someone  out there can plan and think ahead, 'cause I know I sure as hell can't.  So anyway, I'll leave early tomorrow morning for El Dorado, where we have rehersals and dinners and weddings to attend to in the next couple of days.&nbsp; Got my sleeping arrangements taken care of the majority of the trip (Heather said I could crash at her folks' place Friday and Saturday nights, and Amanda W. said she has a couch I'm more than welcome to crash on for as long as I need).&nbsp; Now I just have to make the long drives and all that.&nbsp; At least I won't be having to sleep in the car (like I originally thought I might).  Also found out another friend of mine is engaged to be married this October, Miss Sarah Rosenberg.&nbsp; She's also apparently back in AR after having finished up her Master's degree in Massachusetts (yeah, some people actually manage to complete theirs on time).  Got to talk with Clif this evening.&nbsp; He's not really wanting to leave Colorado, from the sound of it.&nbsp; Not that I can really blame him, mind you--he's spending all his time doing something he loves in an absolutely gorgeous environment.&nbsp; I'd kill to be in his place.&nbsp; Sounds like he also doesn't want anything to do with graduate school.&nbsp; Apparently my experience has made him a little shy of that, and he says he's also just flat-out tired of school.&nbsp; He's ready to do something else for awhile, though what he doesn't know quite yet.  So I'm sitting here using my dad's laptop to use the internet.&nbsp; I'd forgotten there are a few things I dislike when dealing with computers--namely, laptop keyboads (I hate them), dial-up, and not having my music collection readily accessible with the click of a button.&nbsp; On the positive side, he does have an optical mouse hooked up to the machine, and the laptop itself is fairly top of the line, so the slowdown from using dial-up isn't as bad as it could be.&nbsp; The real annoying thing is that after tonight, I won't have any access for a few days.&nbsp; At least the comics seem to be updating as they ought to.&nbsp; Now if only my school email would load.&nbsp; Stupid dial-up.  Well, time for bed.&nbsp; Early morning and a long drive ahead of me tomorrow.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Bob Dylan, "Hard Times in New York Town"

       "Take Your Straight Line For A Curve"   Just finished up "Peas," the short story I wrote for Adam and Monica for their (I think aborted) effort to create a b-film horror flick about a bag of mushy peas gone very, very bad.&nbsp; You can find it over at the  urlLink Live Journal &nbsp;in its entirety.&nbsp; I think the ending came out pretty well, and I'm pleased with the way the story worked out overall.  On deck for the next short story is one of any half dozen I've got started all over the place.&nbsp; I probably ought to work on that short story thing I'm doing for Vapor Lock (a story idea Adam had that he tossed my way and which I'm trying to adapt as a short story featuring his characters).&nbsp; Or I might work on the new Steven Gloryhound story I started the other day that was moving along well.&nbsp; Or maybe the story I started about the kid who finds the magical sword and goes off on an adventure, whether he wanted to or not.&nbsp; Or I'd started a second "Everyman" story (the first one is still one of my favorite stories.&nbsp; I'll probably post it at the LJ next).&nbsp; Maybe something featuring my vampire hunter, Maxwell Shlumpf.&nbsp; I dunno--there are so many possibilities.  Anyway, I still have to pack when I get home from work at 5.00.&nbsp; That could make getting home in time for dinner tonight a toughie.&nbsp; We'll just have to see how that goes.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Matchbox 20, "You Won't be Mine"

       "Do You Think You Can Cope?"   So I was purusing  urlLink the Webcomic List  this morning before work, and I noticed that they've classified  urlLink Dim Bulb  now.&nbsp; See, each comic is lumped into a genre or style, depending on subject matter and art style for the most case.  Now, of all the genres and groupings available, Dim Bulb somehow got put in  urlLink Manga .&nbsp; While I have nothing against manga (Japanese comic books)--in fact, I quite like it--Dim Bulb is not manga.&nbsp; While both Adam and I have manga influences in our art, I follow a decidedly non-manga format (actually, I use a traditional American comic strip format--horizontal panels).&nbsp; Adam tends to follow a more traditional American comic book style and format, even in Troubled Times, the only comic that could realy even be considered halfway manga.  I'm not really annoyed with the classification per se, but it strikes me as inaccurate.&nbsp; Ev agrees with me--he thinks we're better defined as Quirky.&nbsp; Anyway, I'll probably email the guy who runs the list sometime today and talk to him about it.&nbsp; But Ev did have an interesting point when I discussed this with him--at least on the Internet, it seems anymore that a comic with any sort of action in it is automatically classified as "manga."&nbsp; Of course, there is the whole  urlLink chibi   urlLink element   urlLink that   urlLink Adam  kept throwing in for several pages in Troubled Times, but that's only one comic of the three on the site, and it's the one that's updated the least.&nbsp; Ah well--like I said, I'll contact the list guy later today and see what I can do.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Matchbox 20, "Mad Season"

       "The Highway Is Alive Tonight"   Well, anticipation runs high on my part for the trip to Arkansas this week.&nbsp; I'm really ready to go and see all my friends.&nbsp; It's been much too long since the last time we all got to visit, and I get the feeling with so many of them getting married that it'll be a long time before we're all able to meet again.  Been working on Crooked Halo scripts.&nbsp; Got the next three or four scripted out, and hope to have a few more before I leave.&nbsp; The only problem right now is that my ink pen is about to die.&nbsp; I can't go a week and a half without drawing or writing anything while I'm in Arkansas, so I'll have to get some more pens tonight when I go to Target for Scott (they've got a videogame sale going on--a couple of games he wants are only $15, which is a pretty damn good deal).  Ev only has a few more pages of Master's Thesis to read through, and says he'll have it for me tonight.&nbsp; That means I can get corrections done on it before I leave, which'll be nice.&nbsp; Just wish I could get ahold of Dr. Hart so he could look at it, too.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Bruce Springsteen, "Ghost of Tom Joad"

       "It Sucks Me In When You're Aloof"   They went ahead and ended the voting on my battle in the Keenspace Forum Collesium Battle.&nbsp; I was winning something like 13 to 3, so they called a mercy kill--and then I posted my comic, which involved me making my opponent's head explode by listening to me read history at him.&nbsp; In fact, because it amused me, the text I used for the history reading was the first few sentences of my Master's Thesis.  Anyway, I guess my next match will be against the winner of one of the two or three other battles going on right now.&nbsp; For the moment, I'm posting a couple of spectator comics to keep me entertained, and getting ready to leave for a week and a half.  Okay, so there's this thing called the Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards held every year.&nbsp; It's basically like the Academy Awards of Webcomics.&nbsp; You have various categories, such as outstanding sci-fi comic, or outstanding color art, or outstanding writing, character design, what-have-you, and then there's some voting by somebody, and winners are chosen.&nbsp; Well, this year,  urlLink Count Your Sheep  won  urlLink six of them .&nbsp;  Six .&nbsp; That's like...insane.  Of course, Dim Bulb wasn't nominated for anything.&nbsp; Then again, we average about 125 visitors per day, give or take.&nbsp; Probably not the numbers you need to get noticed by this group, y'know?&nbsp; I mean, we're talking the likes of  urlLink Megatokyo ,  urlLink Penny Arcade ,  urlLink Something Positive , and  urlLink Mac Hall .&nbsp; Yeah, I didn't think we could compete with any of them, either, Talon Lueco's insistence that I'm the funniest man alive notwithstanding.  But I'm not worried about that, really--we don't Dim Bulb for recognition and fame and all that.&nbsp; Well, I don't.&nbsp; Maybe Adam does, I dunno.&nbsp; I do Crooked Halo because I enjoy drawing and writing it, I have an attachment to the characters and like working with them.&nbsp; I like Troubled Times because it's a different kind of story for me, an attempt at a serious story (I'm not usually very good at serious, y'know), and it's fun watching something I wrote get turned into a real comic by someone with some serious talent (whatever one may think of my artistic abilities, drawing Troubled Times in the way it needs to be drawn because of the story is way beyond what I could do).&nbsp; Really, I'd still want to do the comics even if there were only two or three people reading.&nbsp; Sure, I'd be disappointed if our readership dropped that much, and I do check our site statistics every day or two, but that's because I also enjoy entertaining people, and I like seeing our numbers go up, because that means more people are being entertained.&nbsp; And that's a good feeling.  Anyway, off for bed.&nbsp; I have work in the morning, and I'd hate to be late; especially because Ev said he ought to have the Master's Thesis proofread for me by then.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: They Might Be Giants, "Ana Ng"

       "Behind My Back Lord, You Made A Fool Of Me"   Well, got all the comics for the next two weeks drawn, scanned, cleaned up, lettered, and uploaded to the server.&nbsp; Auto-update will take care of everything else, though I'll have to update the Crooked Halo archive when I get home with new archive pages for each comic and all that (the regular archive, which doesn't yet allow for cruising individual series, will have all the comics...you'll just have to either read all of Adam's or skip them, however you want to do it).&nbsp; Anyway, I'm glad I got that taken care of, so it's one less thing to worry about.&nbsp; I'll probably work on scripts for the rest of the series this evening, and hopefully get the rest of the Yellowstone Saga scripted out before bed.&nbsp;   Well, off to work on scripts, and probably to exercise--it's too damn nice outside to not take advantage of the weather while it's below 100.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Ben Folds Five, "Battle of Who Could Care Less"

       "We Were Born Before The Wind"   Well, got all six comics drawn for the coming two weeks, and I'm in the process of scanning them all now.&nbsp; As I mentioned last time, I'm very pleased with the way they all turned out.&nbsp; If I can keep up this rhythm, I could get a lot of comics done in a very short amount of time.  There's stil quite a bit to do between now and Tuesday night.&nbsp; I need to get the apartment cleaned up, the dishes need to be done (preferably today...they've been sitting in the sink entirely too long), I need to pack, I have to work Monday and Tuesday (six hours each day, which is better than not working, let me tell you).&nbsp; I have begun the most important part of packing--picking out what CDs I'm taking with me.&nbsp; Clothes are simply there to cover one's body, but the music I'm taking has to last me a week and a half, and keep me awake on the long stretches of boring Oklahoma and Arkansas interstate.&nbsp; As it stands, I'll probably be driving for about eight hours or so on Thursday, another five to seven on Friday, four or five on Sunday, and who knows how many from there.&nbsp; I'll need to make sure I've got enough music to keep me entertained during that time.&nbsp; Here's how the list looks, though it's subject to change at the last minute based on what I decide I want to listen to on Tuesday:  Mutual Admiration Society -  Mutual Admiration Society  Beatles -  Help!  Flaming Lips -  The Soft Bulletin  Pink Floyd -  The Wall  (two discs) Wilco -  Summer Teeth  Bruce Springsteen&nbsp;-  The Rising  Moxy Fruvous -  Live Noise  Bob Dylan -  The Bootleg Series, Vol. 1-3  (three discs) Gorillaz -  Gorillaz  Van Morrison -  Moondance  Eagles -  The Very Best  (two discs) Counting Crows&nbsp;-  Films About Ghosts  David Gray -  Sell, Sell, Sell  Barenaked Ladies -  Stunt  Mark Knopfler -  Sailing to Philadelphia  Glen Phillips -  Live at Largo  The Band -  Greatest Hits  Tom Petty -  Wildflowers  Old 97's -  Too Far to Care   Now, that's only 23 CDs, and my case holds 24; what of the other CD?&nbsp; Well, that'll be a mix CD of my own creation.&nbsp; I've got a playlist put together that I think I'm happy with.&nbsp; It goes something like this:  Ben Folds Five - "Battle of Who Could Care Less" Yoko Kanno & the Seatbelts - "The Egg and I" Beatles - "I Don't Want to Spoil the Party" Wilco - "Airline to Heaven" Allman Brothers Band - "No One to Run With" Electric Light Orchestra - "Ma Ma Ma Belle" Otis Redding - "Sitting on the Dock of the Bay" David Gray - Kangaroo Crosby, Stills, Nash, &amp; Young - "Helplessly Hoping" Flaming Lips - "The Spark that Bled" George Harrison - "P2 Vatican Blues (Last Saturday Night)" Mark Knoplfer - "Hill Farmer's Blues" Gorillaz - "19-2000 (Soulchild Remix)" Moxy Fruvous - "Blow Wind Blow" Better than Ezra - "King of New Orleans" Radiohead - "Street Spirit (Fade Out)" They Might Be Giants - "Don't Let's Start" Tom Petty - "Crawling Back to You" Tom Lehrer - "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park" "Chrono Cross End Theme"  Figure an average run time for a single CD is about 45 minutes, give or take a few (some are longer, such as the one I'm making myself, and some are much shorter).&nbsp; So that gives me roughly 18 hours of music, if I've done my math right.&nbsp; That  might  just about last me the whole trip without repeating anything, but I doubt it.&nbsp; Besides, that's the conservative estimate--most of the CDs I have with me are actually probably longer than 45 minutes a piece, but stuff like each disc of  The Wall  and the Beatles album are only about 30 minutes each, so that brings down the average.  Anyway, that's probably more music crap than any of you wanted to hear from me, but hey, this is my blog, and I'll post about what I damn-well please.&nbsp; So nya.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: ELO, "Ma-ma-ma Belle"

       "It Had Momentum, It Was Gaining Traction"    I've been on a roll the past few hours--I got about four comics drawn during that time, and I'm actually pleased with how they look.&nbsp; This is a rare thing--usually, I'm able to deal with the inadequacies of my art style, and recognize that there are many things which I will never be able to draw, and that I'll probably use the same poses and positions and such for the rest of my artistic life.&nbsp; But tonight's work was just...well, I feel like what I drew was worthwhile and worth looking at.   I've also noticed my art style is evolving slightly.&nbsp; See, I originally switched to a sketchy look 'round about the  urlLink end of October last year , and while I liked the way it allowed me to be looser with my art and more expressive than the smooth lines of my earlier style, I always thought it looked just a bit sloppy (especially when, as often happened, I was very lazy with my linework.&nbsp; In those instances, what I came up with often looked like crap).&nbsp; However, it did have advantages over the smooth style--the sketchy look gave the drawings depth and a sense of action and movement, while the smooth style always looked flat and really rather lifeless.&nbsp; Anyway, I finally figured out what I was really wanting to do, and the sketchy style was simply a step in that direction.&nbsp; My most recent comics retain the energy and depth of the sketchy style, but are much cleaner in terms of the linework and style.&nbsp; I rather like it, and my most recent efforts (from tonight) really show off the evolved style well.&nbsp; Like I said, I'm genuinely happy with the way the comics I drew look.   Anyway, I was very productive with the comics tonight, then--I only need to draw one more to have enough comics to cover my vacation period.&nbsp; Of course, I've only scanned, cleaned up, and uploaded one comic of the six I need, but four more are drawn, so that's good.&nbsp; At this rate, I may even be able to draw the Semi-Troubled Times strip Adam wanted me to do for Saturday the 7th of August, since he'll be going off on his honeymoon then.&nbsp; Oh, and on the subject of Troubled Times--I have to admit, the past few pages of it have been my favorites of the comic thusfar.&nbsp; Seeing the scene as it plays out in Adam's artwork has been like watching one of my dreams unfold--hell, it basically  is  watching one of my dreams unfold, or at least one of my stories.&nbsp; His most recent page, with Teran channeling the Wrath of God and smiting demons left and right, is--in my opinion--among the finest pages he's ever turned out for  anything .&nbsp; And to think it's based on something I wrote (however loosely--I did write a few directions down for actions in this scene, but they're along the lines of "Teran catches a sword with his bare hands and then kills the demon in a really cool way.&nbsp; Then he punches another demon in the head, shattering that one's skull, and punches a hole through another demon's chest, etc.").&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam's giving flesh and movement and substance to the skeleton directions I gave him, and it's one of the coolest feelings in the world, seeing that happen.&nbsp; If only he had time to do more than one page a week (actually, it's probably a good thing he can only do that much, or he'd catch up to what I've scripted much quicker...which reminds me--I need to get back to work on Chapter Three pretty soon).   Anyway, that's enough comic talk for tonight.&nbsp; It's late/early, I'm goin' to bed.   ~chuck   Song of the Moment: Otis Redding, "Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay"

       "The Eighties!&nbsp; They Make My Brain Hurt!"   Okay, so Scott and I have very, very different tastes in music.&nbsp; We both like rock and roll, but "rock and roll" covers a lot of stylistic territory.&nbsp; It's a metagenre, an ubergenre which encompasses everything from the Beatles to Bob Dylan to Styx to Pink Floyd to Heart to Journey to the Doors.&nbsp; It's a catch-all, really.  Anyway, Scott's tastes tend towards the '80s, when everything was slick and smooth and every single note was produced and redone until it was perfect.&nbsp; That's what the '80s, as a musical decade, was about: getting every note perfect, getting the shine and sheen on the music so that it sparkled and shone and you didn't notice that the lyrics were pretty bland compared to what had gone before.&nbsp; It was a case of style and form over content and meaning.&nbsp; And that's fine--genre exercises and stylistic endeavours can be fun, and sometimes it's nice to listen to stuff that has absolutely no substance but which sounds very pretty and very glossy.&nbsp; But that's about all Scott wants to listen to.  Myself, I've always been more about the substance and the content than the form.&nbsp; That's why I can stand to listen to musicians like Bob Dylan and Van Morrison and Neil Young; guys who--though they had lots to say and could blend genres and styles and forms like mad geniuses--can't really sing to save their lives.&nbsp; They're singer/songwriters, and the emphasis was always on the songwriter part of that description.&nbsp; Besides, I tend to just like music that retains a bit of the rough edges, that keeps some of the rawness to the instrumentation and vocals.&nbsp; It seems more real, more organic, more  human .&nbsp; Music is a human expression, after all.&nbsp; That's why I've never been able to listen to most contemporary pop-rock--it's all too glossy, too overproduced and overwrought, until all the life and energy and meaning has been produced out of the music.&nbsp; I'm not saying music needs to be sloppy, mind you--Dylan had some tight backing bands, Neil Young worked with the folk-rock gods Crosby, Stills, & Nash, and Van the Man has had some of the most consumate musicians to ever play working with him--but they all know how to keep enough of the raggedness in their music to keep it sounding like real people are playing the instruments.  Admittedly, I do like bands such as Radiohead, Pink Floyd, and the Flaming Lips--all of which create carefully thought-out, well-crafted songs--but the key thing about all three bands is that their best moments come when retain a certain organic quality to their music, pushing forward musical boundaries while remembering that it's people who're  making  the music.  Anyway, the whole point of this rant is that Scott's asked me to download some music for him to put together a CD, since he doesn't currently have much in the way of internet access (my folks figure there's no need to have an internet-ready computer at the house anymore since the kids are all gone).&nbsp; So I've been having to deal with his taste in music.  What's worse, he's developed the opinion that anything by the artists he likes is good.&nbsp; This often means their new albums.&nbsp; Now, while some groups and musicians--folks like Dylan, Van, U2, and Bruce Springsteen--have managed to put out downright  phenomenal  albums lately, they are the exceptions to the rule rather than what should be expected of everyone.&nbsp; Folks like Styx and Peter Frampton were good at their peeks, but their peeks occurred about twenty-five, thirty years ago.&nbsp; Scott is absolutely in love with the latest Styx and Boston albums, and what I've heard of both just made me shake my head--they're trying to reignite that old flame of inspiration, to recapture the glory of their early days, and it's just not working.&nbsp; They're working with the intent of making a "comeback," and this conscious effort to create something which will get them back in the good graces of the general public is preventing them from crafting good music.&nbsp; Guys like Dylan and Van have been so successful lately (and by successful I mean they've created albums that are on par with their best work) because they haven't attempted to create music which is epochal or a "comeback" statement.&nbsp; Ironically, because they haven't been attempting to craft commercial comebacks, they've done very well.  Of course, Scott thinks the new albums by his favorites are absolutely wonderful and on par with their best work, and musical taste is of course very subjective.&nbsp; However, there are certain things which it is possible to be very objective and positive about--I'm positive there's no world in which the music Britney Spears is making will be popular a decade or two from now.&nbsp; Already she's really become less&nbsp;a musical figure and more a celebrity, which is an entirely different animal (someone who creates music, a "musician," approaches music as something important in and of itself; a celebrity sees music, television, or motion pictures as a means to an end--celebrity status, pop culture icon status--and thus care very little about what they are making.&nbsp; They're the ones we don't really care about after their fifteen minutes of fame are over).  All of this to say--I really don't care for the music he's making me download.&nbsp; My sibling will pay for this in blood.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Crosby, Stills, Nash, &amp; Young, "Helplessly Hoping"

       "Pay No Mind To It"   Went and saw  The Chronicles of Riddick  last night at the cheap theatre.&nbsp; It was your typical summer blockbuster/special CGI effects extravaganza, and about what I expected.&nbsp; Was worth the $1.50 I paid, but I don't think I'd have paid full price for it. It had the same spirit as  Pitch Black , but wasn't nearly as neat as that movie.&nbsp; Some of the CGI was too obviously CGI, but that's what you expect out of a flick like this.&nbsp; It's a good popcorn movie, and would probably be worth a rental if you're in the mood for Vin Diesel.  It's really...cool outside today.&nbsp; The temperature dropped pretty good yesterday afternoon when I went to go get my car out of the shop, mostly because it started pouring down rain.&nbsp; Even with my umberella (which I realized I left in Dom's truck), I was still pretty soggy just walking from my apartment door to his truck.&nbsp; But it did cool things off, and today's simply continued that trend.&nbsp; It's in the mid-70s out there, with a slight breeze, and about 80% humidity, so it feels a bit thick.&nbsp; But still, it's nice, if a bit too cloudy for my tastes.&nbsp; See, when it's cloudy, I tend to not want to get out of bed.&nbsp; That was the case today, as I didn't drag my sorry butt out of bed until 3.00 pm.  So I figured I need to draw a total of six comics before Tuesday so I have enough done for the coming weeks while I'm gone.&nbsp; I've got one done so far, and only a couple of days left to do the other five.&nbsp; But I've got the next several comics scripted out already, so it shouldn't be too much of a hassle getting the five done...I hope.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Dandy Warhols, "Minnesoter"

       "The Words Are Comin' Out All Weird"   Got the car back this afternoon finally.&nbsp; Took some doing, though--Dom either had his cellphone off or wasn't answering it for a good part of the middle of the day, and then when I finally got ahold of him and he agreed to give me a lift, it decided to poor down rain.&nbsp; At least the rain waited until after I'd gone to campus to pick up my paycheck (by bike, mind you), so that was a small blessing.  Looks like my work schedule when I get back from vacation will be nice--I'll actually be  working , which is something of a novelty of late.&nbsp; Hopefully this trend will continue, and I'll even be able to pay rent and stuff in the upcoming months!  Not much to say, really.&nbsp; It's quiet here at work, and I'm probably getting ready to leave.&nbsp; Might go see a movie at the cheap theatre tonight-- Van Helsing  and  Chronicles of Riddick  are both playing, and either would be worth seeing for $1.50.&nbsp; I'll go see the former if Ev goes with me, but the latter if I go by myself.&nbsp; Troy also happens to be playing over there, but you'd have to pay  me  to go see that stinker.&nbsp; I'm also craving movie theatre popcorn with lots of butter.&nbsp; I like popcorn quite a bit, but I don't usually crave it that often, and certainly not the movie theatre variety, which is such a dangerous substance that you can actually hear your arteries clogging and choking as you chew.&nbsp; But damn if it isn't a tasty way to kill yourself.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Radiohead, "The Bends"

       "Have You Really Changed That Much Since School?"   Well, for rather annoying reasons, I was unable to pick up my car this afternoon, despite the fact that it was completed right about the time I figured it would be.  See, I was going to just ask Dom if he could give me a ride over there.&nbsp; But when I called him up, he was taking Jess to an eye doctor's appointment, and thus couldn't oblige me.  Next I tried calling Audrey, 'cause I knew she had a car.&nbsp; She wasn't home.  So the only other person I know is Ev, and he doesn't have a car.&nbsp; But a friend of his had a car, a friend who happened to be coming over to Ev's place this afternoon, same as me.&nbsp; His friend (Kevin) agreees to take me.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we spent too much time piddling and chatting at Ev's, so when we tried to go get the car, we had the joy of watching the last guy drive away from the body shop after they'd closed for the day.&nbsp; So I'll just have to see if Dom can take me in the morning, I guess.&nbsp; It's not a big deal so much as it's an annoyance and an inconvenience.  I've also spent most of the evening napping, a habit I don't like engaging in.&nbsp; The problem with napping that late in the day (we're talking 6.30 to 8.30 or so) is that I'm now not going to be tired enough to go to bed at a reasonable hour tonight.&nbsp; Ugh.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Sheryl Crow, "Members Only"

       "Set 'Em Up And Let 'Em Fall"   So Wendy tells me that she found out she got hired on as the new drama teacher at Fairfax High School in Fairfax, VA.&nbsp; She starts in September, but her training starts August 26th.&nbsp; Her current job ends August 24th.&nbsp; The point to all this is that she doesn't get to come visit Oklahoma in August like she was planning to do.  The other point is that now she owes me a trip to Cancun.  See, we made a bet a year or two ago that the first one of us to get a teaching job (regardless of the level) would take the other to Cancun.&nbsp; So now she gets to take me.&nbsp; Of course, it'll be a while, because she'll need to save up money and she wants me to bring a girl along (since she'll be bringing her boyfriend Tim).&nbsp; It'll probably take me longer to find a girlfriend than it'll take Wen to save up the money for the trip, but that's okay.  Still waiting to hear back from Ferguson on my car.&nbsp; I'd like it if they'd let me know within the next hour or so, so I can get the car before I'm supposed to be at Everett's.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Pink Floyd and Van Morrison, "Comfortably Numb (Live)"

       "Most Of The Time She Ain't Even In My Mind"   I've got a face that just says to strangers, "hey, tell me your life story," don't I?&nbsp; Why do complete strangers feel compelled to tell me very intimate details of their personal history without me in any way requesting this?  Take this morning, for instance--I took my car in to have the window replaced, and they get one of the mechanics to give me a lift back to the apartment.&nbsp; On the trip across town, the guy engages me in a conversation not only about music (which I didn't mind until he strayed into a discussion of country), but then it suddenly morphed into a conversation about this guy's trouble with women and how he'd given up drinking back in February.&nbsp; Congrats and all on the being sober, guy, but is this really something I need to know?&nbsp; Do I need to know that you, a man the same age as my father, are dealing with girl troubles?&nbsp; No, I don't.&nbsp; Knowing this stuff doesn't make it any easier for my window to be fixed, though I guess the guy has a right to be proud of being sober for five months.&nbsp; But I don't think a customer is the sort of person you're supposed to impart this sort of knowledge to, y'know?&nbsp; Doesn't really ease my mind to think that he was probably a drunkard the last time he worked on my car.  Anyway, they ought to be done with my car sometime early this afternoon, and at 2.30 I'm supposed to go over to Ev's place to watch the second part of the Joseph Campbell interview we started watching at the beginning of the month.  Also, I've finally heard from one of my professors in regards to my Master's Thesis.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it was the one who is out of the country and won't be able to look at the thing until mid-August.&nbsp; That's not really very helpful.&nbsp; I need to find my advisor's phone number today.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Ringo Starr, "It Don't Come Easy"

       "Sadly Sweet Like A Wilco Song"   It's just a few minutes after 8.00 am, and I'm already at work.&nbsp; I wasn't scheduled to work until 11.00, but one of my coworkers called me up at 2.30 this morning asking if I'd cover her 8-11 shift.&nbsp; She didn't really provide much of a reason--I think her exact words were that she had "something else [she] wants to do"--but it's an extra three hours for me, so I'm not going to complain much, even if I did only get three hours of sleep because of her and her inability to plan further ahead.  Thought I saw Megan Garland, an old junior high/high school friend, while I was in the store this morning getting something to drink (caffinated beverages are a Godsend, folks).&nbsp; I'm not certain it was her, because I never heard her speak and she didn't seem to recognize me, but she was carrying a Beatles purse, had Pink Floyd stickers on her car, and she just  looked  like Megan.&nbsp; I know from talking to Jessica that Megan still lives around here, so it very well could have been her.&nbsp; The rest of the evidence seems to fit, too--back in junior high, she was the only other person I knew my age who liked the Beatles.&nbsp; In the eighth grade, we actually did a project together on Hypercard (this old Mac program that, in hindsight, was like a really easy-to-use webpage builder) in which we cataloged all their albums and songs, putting together lyrics for the really important ones (often from memory, 'cause we had all the songs memorized), animations of various things (we were excited to get to use the new scanner--a handheld device that was brand freakin' new way back in 1993--and we were particularly proud of our floating Yellow Submarine), and biographies.&nbsp; We were never necessarily very close, but she was someone I knew who wasn't ashamed to know me (that was a short list in junior high, let me tell you).  My vacation starts next week.&nbsp; I'm excited--a week and a half just visiting with&nbsp;Ozarks friends, no obligations except standing in one place for the space of an hour or so at various and sundry weddings...it's gonna be fun.&nbsp; Have to get some comics cranked out, though, so I don't miss any updates while I'm away.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Glen Phillips, "Back on my Feet"

       "I Have Become Comfortably Numb"  &nbsp; Poor Jess and Dom.&nbsp; Jessica was feeling ill Friday night after we'd all gone out to eat (in fact, they actually left their leftovers in my fridge...the stuff is still there).&nbsp; We sat and looked through the 700 pictures (literally that many) from their wedding, then they headed home 'cause she wasn't feeling well. &nbsp; Well, it turns out that was only the beginning.&nbsp; They apparently both had tonsilitis.&nbsp; Bad.&nbsp; As in they had to visit the emergency room twice on Saturday. &nbsp; When I talked to Dom this afternoon, he said they were both recovering, but it had been a very long weekend.&nbsp; Even though they're recovering, he wasn't really up for playing racquetball this afternoon--and to be frank, I'm not all that heartbroken.&nbsp; I don't want to chance him being contagious or something. &nbsp; Also called the folks at Fergusson (the place where my car was repaired back last year when that idiot business professor rear-ended me in the parking garage....while my car was parked) to see about them going ahead and ordering the new window and installing it.&nbsp; The guy said he'd get right on it and call me when the part gets in, so that's taken care of now, thankfully. &nbsp; Still haven't heard from my advisor or anyone on the Master's Thesis.&nbsp; I may call him tomorrow if I haven't heard from him by the end of the day...of course, that requires finding his phone number... &nbsp; ~chuck &nbsp; Song of the Moment: Fleetwood Mac, "Say That You Love Me"

       "Finding More Than One Wind Blows"  &nbsp; I got eleven freakin' hours of sleep last night. &nbsp; Yeah, eleven.&nbsp; I haven't gotten eleven hours of sleep in the previous  week .&nbsp; But I got back from my aunt and uncle's place yesterday evening, piddled around for a couple of hours, and then did some reading.&nbsp; I was sitting in bed, reading my book, and I start to feel tired.&nbsp; I look over at the clock, which reads 11.00 pm.&nbsp; I think, "y'know, there's really nothing keeping me awake.&nbsp; The Master's Thesis has been sent to my committee, so I don't have to stay awake all night working on it.&nbsp; I  could  go ahead and go to sleep..." &nbsp; So I did.&nbsp; God, it was glorious! &nbsp; Also found out that the cost of having my window won't be quite as bad as I originally thought.&nbsp; Turns out the guy I talked to at the glass place on Main Street is a moron and confused the window I needed with one that opens or whatever.&nbsp; Yeah, the cost of replacing my window with the correct item is something closer to $225--still kinda expensive, but a good $200 cheaper than what the moron thought it'd be. &nbsp; So yeah, it's been a pretty good day.&nbsp; Anyway, I'm off to do some writing.&nbsp; Maybe I can make some headway on "Peas." &nbsp; ~chuck &nbsp; Song of the Moment: Toad the Wet Sprocket, "One Little Girl"

       "There's No One Laughing At Your Back Now"  &nbsp; And the second draft is done.&nbsp; Finally.&nbsp; Page total this time out was 31 in Times New Roman 12-Point Font.&nbsp; That's an increase of probably about seven pages from where it stood in the previous draft (if you put the previous draft in Times New Roman, that is--that version was originally in Bookman Old Style, which is quite a big larger.&nbsp; It was 28 pages in Bookman, and only about 24 in Times New Roman).&nbsp; So yeah, there was quite a bit added.&nbsp; I'm rather pleased with what I've put together here.&nbsp; I just hope my advisor is. &nbsp; I forgot to mention something earlier--when I was in the library, the microfilm machines didn't agree with me.&nbsp; When the printer on the first one decided not to work for me anymore, the guy working in the Microform Room came over to work on it for me.&nbsp; When he couldn't get it to work, I moved over to the next machine.&nbsp; Then he got out the key to the printer for the one I had moved to, and let me make several copies for free (a copy usually costs 15 cents, or 10 if you use your student ID--SoonerCents, it's called).&nbsp; So that was rather cool. &nbsp; Anyway, it's printing off right now.&nbsp; I've emailed my advisor his copy, but I'm hand-delivering a copy to Ev to proofread for grammatical stuff.&nbsp; Come to think of it, I probably should have run spellcheck on the damn thing, especially since a good majority of it was written late tonight.&nbsp; Argh. &nbsp; ~chuck &nbsp; Song of the Moment: Bob Dylan, "Most of the Time"

       "She'll Take What You Give Her, As Long As It's Free"    &nbsp; Progress note on the Thesis: ran into a bit of a slow-down this afternoon after I finally got all my research notes typed out--I remembered that my advisor wanted me to include some stuff from a primary source I'd mentioned through a different primary source (a primary source quoting/arguing with  another  primary source...wee.&nbsp; He wanted what the  original  said, so as to know the guy I was quoting wasn't just making shit up, as it were).&nbsp; Well, they had the document on microfilm over at the library.&nbsp; Wonderful--that means I can get it.&nbsp; But there was a snag--in order to get a copy of it, I needed some cash to get photocopies, and I had none.&nbsp; So I had to run to Wal-Mart to get some money (and some batteries for my discman).&nbsp; Then I had to go somewhere to break the twenty, 'cause there was no way I was gonna put that whole thing on my ID for photocopying and stuff.&nbsp; So anyway, I was up against a deadline, 'cause I realized I needed to do this around 4.30, and the library closed at 6.00 today.&nbsp; So I rushed--and made it.&nbsp; Got my money, got my source, and I'm going over it now to figure out what to include. &nbsp; Well, back to the grind. &nbsp; ~chuck &nbsp; Song of the Moment: Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, "Built to Last"

       "Walked Into A Tenth-Avenue Freeze-Out"  &nbsp; Got my notes finished up.&nbsp; Printing them out as we speak.&nbsp; That means I'm ready to start writing. &nbsp; Only had a couple of interruptions so far--my mom called to talk (read: yell at me) about some stuff, including my spending habits (which are admittedly atrocious); I had to eat breakfast; talked with Amanda Erisman on Messenger for a bit (though admittedly, I was still typing notes on Hobbes at the same time--I can multi-task!), and found out that Sarah Rosenberg is apparently engaged; I saw some pretty dust floating in the air, and had to watch that for a while (sometimes  anything  can be distracting, if you want to be distracted enough). &nbsp; Now it's time to integrate what I've got with what I had.&nbsp; Dunno how well this will work, or how unwieldy the finished product will be.&nbsp; Guess we'll find out. &nbsp; ~chuck &nbsp; Song of the Moment: Toad the Wet Sprocket, "One Wind Blows"

       "I'm Staring Out The Window Of The St. James Hotel"  &nbsp; Alright, it's currently 11.50 am.&nbsp; I've got roughly thirteen or fourteen hours' worth of useful time on my hands during which to get my second draft of the Master's Thesis completed.&nbsp; I will have it done before I go to bed tonight.&nbsp; I'm getting my playlist set (I want there to be plenty of tunes for this so I don't get bored with the music that's playing), I'm clearing away my workspace, and I'm preparing my mind for churning out history.&nbsp; Wish me luck. &nbsp; ~chaos cricket &nbsp; Song of the Moment: Radiohead, "Gagging Order"

       "Something In My Veins Bloodier Than Blood"    &nbsp; So the anger I had at my window being smashed in is now a searing, blinding, white-hot rage.&nbsp; I've calmed down a little over the past couple of hours since I came to work, but not much. &nbsp; Why am I so pissed?&nbsp; I found out how much they want to replace that little window: $430. &nbsp; Yeah, that's right: $430.&nbsp; For a window about half a foot by two feet in size. &nbsp; I don't know who it was who smashed my window.&nbsp; I don't know why the did it--probably just for a lark, or to be destructive and malicious.&nbsp; Frankly,&nbsp; I don't really care why they did it.&nbsp; What I care about is that because of their callousness, because of their disrespect for other people and other people's property, I now have to shell out nearly $500 to get a little fucking window replaced.&nbsp; The sheer absurdity of this--that I, as a victim of random vandalism, now have to pay for being a vicitim--pisses me off so much, I can hardly see straight.&nbsp; I've accomplished  nothing  today because of all this.&nbsp; I hold that nameless stranger responsible for all of this, and I hope that if he or she is caught,&nbsp;I get a chance to prosecute them.&nbsp; Because I damn well didn't have the money to pay for this right now, but I'm sure as hell not just going to leave a gaping hole in my window like that. &nbsp; On top of all that, there's a chance of rain tonight and tomorrow.&nbsp; Reality's just trying to shit on my parade today, you know? &nbsp; ~chuck &nbsp; Song of the Moment: Wilco, "In a Future Age"

       "Walking On Broken Glass"  &nbsp; Well, I had a nice little wake-up call this morning. &nbsp; I was sitting at the computer, checking email and getting ready to have a quick bite of breakfast, when the phone rang.&nbsp; It was the OU Police.&nbsp; At first, I was afraid I'd done something wrong, though I couldn't recall anything I'd done in recent past or why they'd be calling me on it at 7.00 am.&nbsp; But it turns out someone had smashed in one of my car windows late last night/early this morning.&nbsp; That was loads of fun to discover.&nbsp; Apparently mine wasn't the only car vandalized--a couple of others in my complex's parking lot also had windows smashed, and the other car that I saw had a major window completely smashed in, whereas I only suffered a fist-sized hole in the small half-window in the rear passenger door (thank goodness for small favors, eh?). &nbsp; Thankfully, nothing was taken out of my car...not that there was&nbsp;a lot in the car, and nothing worth taking, but the sort of asshole who would smash in a window for a lark isn't above rummaging through someone's stuff and randomly taking any of it.&nbsp; But oddly enough, after having gone&nbsp;to the effort of even breaking the little window, they didn't even bother trying to open the door or anything.&nbsp; Well, they might have, but they must've been really conscientious if they did--the door was locked, none of the glass sitting on the armrest had been disturbed or moved, and they left everything inside the car exactly as it had been.&nbsp; Somehow, I have my doubts they actually wanted to break in, and instead simply wanted to cause destruction.  I'll never be able to understand the sort of mentality that is necessary to find this sort of malicious destruction of personal property entertaining or amusing.&nbsp; Obviously some people are entertained by vandalism, but I'll be damned if I can see where the pleasure in it is.&nbsp; As it stands, I'm annoyed as hell, because now I have to pay money because someone else was a fucking asshole and struck out at my car completely at random.&nbsp; I'm nearly 100% convinced that it's completely at random, because I don't think I have any enemies here at OU, and if I do, I don't think they necessarily know what car I drive,  and  where I live,  and  that they'd also go around smashing in other car windows as well as mine.&nbsp; If I'm dealing with an enemy, they're very clever, and if that is the case, I would seriously kick their ass when I found who they were. &nbsp; But no, I have to deal with effects of some random idiot's asanine behavior now, which means shelling out money I  don't  have to pay for something I  shouldn't  have to replace.&nbsp; But such is life, eh? &nbsp; ~chaos cricket &nbsp; Song of the Moment: Counting Crows, "Round Here (Live)"

       "Then He Giggled In French, That's What He Did"   &nbsp;  Work on the thesis proceeds well.&nbsp; I'm not really able to do a whole lot on it while I'm here at work, because the books I brought with me aren't what I needed.&nbsp; But I didn't completely waste my time--I looked up some other sources that I'll grab from the library before I head home.&nbsp; I just hope they're actually there. &nbsp; Whenever I go to work or out and about, I usually carry a small, six-CD carrying case.&nbsp; It came with the Jimmy, apparently, and just sat there for the three years my mom drove the car.&nbsp; It's nice and compact, and thus ideal for sliding into my schoolbag.&nbsp; Anyway, it's current contents are: &nbsp; Mutual Admiration Society -  Mutual Admiration Society  Wilco -  Summer Teeth  Flaming Lips&nbsp;-  The Soft Bulletin  Counting Crows -  Across a Wire (Live in NYC)  Elliot Smith -  Either/Or  &nbsp; What's striking about that list is the complete and total lack of anything Classic Rock.&nbsp; Admittedly, bands like the Counting Crows are roots rock, and thus rely heavily on classic rock styles and themes.&nbsp; The Crows owe a lot to the music of Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen, and the Byrds.&nbsp; The Wilco album is almost a blatant&nbsp;homage to the Velvet Underground.&nbsp; The Flaming Lips owe a lot to bands like Pink Floyd and  Sgt. Pepper's  era Beatles.&nbsp; MAS has a folky, acoustic feel that you just can't help but love.&nbsp; Elliot Smith falls somewhere between Wilco and Glen Phillips's solo work, only much darker than either. &nbsp; But all of these albums were released within the past decade (1997 for  Either/Or , 1998 for  Across a Wire , 1999 for both  The Soft Bulletin  and  Summer Teeth , and this past Tuesday for  Mutual Admiration Society ).&nbsp; I've noticed that the older I get, the more my musical tastes evolve.&nbsp; I still love the music I grew up listening to--nothing will ever be better than the Beatles, and albums like  A Hard Day's Night  and  Help!  and  Rubber Soul  are infinitely superior to 99% of the stuff that's released today, and at least as good as the other 1%.&nbsp; It's not that I've abandoned the music of my youth, simply that I've added to it.&nbsp; I've built upon the foundation that music laid.&nbsp; The bands I've added have many elements in common with the bands I've loved for years--great lyrics, catchy melodies, and especially a willingness to explore music as not just a pleasant noise, but a&nbsp;method of personal expression.&nbsp; Keep in mind that as I've started listening to more contemporary bands (or bands which are more contemporary, however you want to interpret it), I've also started listening to more classic rock.&nbsp; I've developed my obsession with Dylan in only the past few years, and I've started listening to Van Morrison, and the Band and the Allman Brothers and various others. &nbsp; Like I said, nothing's been abandoned, just added to. &nbsp; ~chaos cricket &nbsp; Song of the Moment: Counting Crows, "Catapult (Live)"

       "For The Sake Of The World Just Forget About Me"   We are gathered here to mourn the passing of my Union Jack keychain.  It broke sometime today after work, the plastic loop which hung from the metal ring finally giving way after constant use for about seven years.  I'm sad to see it go, especially because of the memories attached to it.  The keychain was given to me by Wendy early in our senior year of high school.  She'd gone to Europe for a few weeks that summer with her sister, and brought it back because she knew I liked England (yes, even then I was an Anglophile.  What can I say?  They had the Beatles).  It was a simple plastic keychain with the Union Jack (the British flag, FYI) in it.  I immediately began using it, and haven't stopped since until today.  The keychain's seen some wear and tear over the past seven years.  It's rather banged up, worn, and the plastic isn't nearly as clear and clean as it once was.  But it was still on my set of keys, a constant item in my pocket, a familiar weight there and a comfort in a strange way.  I liked that keychain mostly because it reminded of that which I love--not only England, but Wendy.  She's my best friend, and has been for almost seven years now.  Admittedly, I don't need a physical reminder of these things--they're ground into my personality and soul in a way that they cannot be removed.  But it was nice to have a tangible item to remind me, and I'll miss that.  Now, my key ring consists of the remote to my car, various keys, several of the metal rings (four, to be exact--though the one from the Union Jack keychain has nothing on it now), and my Ozarks Outbackers keychain, which the indomitable Amanda Erisman convinced me (read: smile pretty and said "Chuck, you know you want a keychain") to buy.  Yeah, this post was kinda weird, but sleep deprivation and a Master's Thesis will do that to you.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Mutual Admiration Society, "Comes a Time"

       "Isn't It Good Again?"   Just picked up Mutual Admiration Society, an album by Glen Phillips (formerly of Toad the Wet Sprocket and one of my favorite musicians) and Nickel Creek.  I'm not quite through the entire album yet, but I wanted to share my thoughts on what I've heard so far (there's only a track or two left, so I feel I have a fairly good idea what the set feels like).  This is, to be honest, a wonderful collection of originals and covers.  The entire album was rehersed, recorded, and mixed in  six days  back in December 2000.  Due to record company issues, they were unable to release it until now, and it was well-worth the wait.  The performances are tight and beautiful, despite the speed with which the album was put together.  Their musicianship is mellow and understated, with melodic and subtle instrumentation.  Glen and the kids from Nickel Creek turn in great vocal performances as well, perfectly capturing the mood of these songs.  Overall, this is a very laidback album, and it captures the spirit of fun and joy evident throughout perfectly.  Stylistically, the music is very much in the Nickel Creek form, though the original songs on the album were written by Glen.  It does sound like Glen's solo work as well; almost like an acoustic version of his first solo outing.  To be honest, the style falls somewhere between the two, and it is a warm, inviting sound that simply melts into your consciousness without your hardly noticing.  All in all, I highly recommend the album to anyone who likes either Glen's solo stuff or Nickel Creek.  You won't be disappointed.  This is some of the finest Americana out there.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Mutual Admiration Society, "Sake of the World"

       "Right Now All I Got's This Lonesome Day"   Well, with Everett's help, I've managed to turn a so-so introduction into a strong paragraph that actually sets up my argument clearly and effectively.  I'm glad to have that taken care of, because Lord knows it was creating a huge mental block and preventing me from writing anything else.  I'm sitting here at work, operating on about an hour's worth of sleep (sometime between 8.00 and 9.00 o'clock this morning), and trying to concentrate long enough to type up some research notes.  I've got a couple of my books with me, and I've realized there's some other stuff I need to look up (need to find Hobbes's  Leviathan , maybe some Lockean social contract theory, and a couple of other things), but for the most part all I need to do is look through my new research, and then write.  Writing will actually be the easy part now.  I'll probably even be excising a few sections of the original text, because the stuff is irrelevant to my central argument, or because I don't like what I've got.  We'll just have to see.  After work, I'm going home to catch a few hours of sleep, then it's back to work on the thesis.  I'm determined to have this thing done by Friday.  I  will  have this thing done Friday.  I have to, really.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: XTC, "Senses Working Overtime"

       "Come On, Rise Up"   It's 5.00 am, and I should be asleep.  I'm not.  I think stress is finally starting to kick in; a sort of fear is overtaking me and kick-starting my brain, making me do the things I should have done ages ago.  To put it another way--I'm finally starting to do some work on the second draft of the Thesis.  Got the new introduction written, and it's significantly better, though it's still a little weak in places.  Tomorrow (well, later today), I'm going to finish all the grammatical corrections.  Then I'm going to start going through the other books I checked out for research.  I hope to have that done before I go to bed Wednesday night.  I hope to have the second draft completed before I go to work Friday night at 5.00 pm.  This may or may not be realistic, but I have got to get this thing done.  If I have to have another draft of this paper after this one, with such extensive changes as this draft requires...I won't be able to get it done in time to have it finished for summer graduation.  With me being gone for a week in early August, and then gone for a good part of the next week after that, I have to have this thing finished in just under two weeks.  That includes defending it.  That's not much time.    I should go try to get some sleep.  I have work later this morning, and I'd like to get something done while I'm there.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Bruce Springsteen, "My City of Ruins"

       "Look At The Sun"   Ever notice the recurring sunrise imagery in pop music?  You've got the first line of Dylan's "Tangled up in Blue": "Early one morning the sun was shinin'."  The Beatles had "Here Comes the Sun" and "Good Day Sunshine."  Donovan began his song "Sunshine Superman" with the line "Sunshine came softly through my window today."  The Eagles have "Tequila Sunrise;"  Smashmouth have a tune called "Then the Morning Comes;" The Call have "Let the Day Begin."  There is a recurring theme of renewal and new beginning in most of these songs.  "Tangled up in Blue" recounts an almost soap opera-esque love affair featuring a cast of several characters, all remembered while the narrator lies in bed reminiscing.  It ends with hope:    Now I'm going back again, I've got to get to her somehow   All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now   Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives   Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they do with their lives   But me I'm still on the road, heading for another joint   We always did feel the same we just saw it from a different point of view   Tangled up in blue.  Both Beatles tunes deal with the narrator's joy at seeing the sun again, either after a cold, dark winter (in the case of "Here Comes the Sun") or even just after a night (as with "Good Day Sunshine").  There is a simple joy in seeing the bright light, in feeling the warmth of the sun on their skin.  They feel fresh, clean, and new.  Donovan's song is something of a stream-of-conscience rambling, though the opening line does present more of the renewal imagery.  He claims he could "drift off easy" lying there in his room with the sunlight streaming in, but he's "changed [his] ways."  With the new day comes new determination to be a better person, a different person.  The Eagles' "Tequla Sunrise" is somewhat darker, relating a man's sorrowful drinking over a woman who has wronged him.  The rising sun causes him to look back on the relationship through a haze of alcohol.  In this case, the rising sun is not simply a sign of renewal.  Instead, it represents a clear sign that life, regardless of what has already happened, continues on, though it still "looks the same" to the narrator.  He does not get his renewal, nor does he receive a sense of hope from the rising sun.  Instead, it just reminds him that, despite his heartache, the world goes on as it ever did.  The Smashmouth song "Then the Morning Comes" takes the renewal metaphor in a different direction.  The narrator addresses a woman who views the world as a stage upon which she is the center of attention, a born party-goer for whom "every single day is just a fling," but "then the morning comes," and she is forced to deal with reality.  It is less a renewal and more a rude wake up call--the female character dreads the morning rather than revels in it.  Coincidentally, she is portrayed in a negative, almost condescending manner by the narrator, as though she were behaving in a fashion which was clearly against common sense.  The Call's "Let the Day Begin" is a benediction to the sunrise, a glorying in the rising orb of light that heats this world.  The singer rattles off a list of the various people who, in own little ways, make life worth living or sacrifice their lives to the betterment of mankind.  He praises these individuals, and thanks them for their ability to get up every day and go out there to work.  The beginning day is a sign of celebration, and a call to action.  There are many, many more pop-rock songs which use the sunrise imagery.  It's a common theme in music--the renewal, the casting off of the past to pursue the future, the pure joy at the warmth and light of the returned sun.  Though no two musicians treat the symbol in the same manner, it is still almost as common as a song about unrequited love.  The sunrise and the returned sun are a common thematic symbol in pop music, and can be one of the more uplifting metaphors for our lives available.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Beatles, "Here Comes the Sun"

       "I Stood Up And I Said Yeah!"   I'm already ready to go home already.  Work's pretty quiet, though we do actually have a student in here(!), something that's a rare occurance during the summer.  Part of me is wanting to go play racquetball (an activity which would require getting ahold of Dom and Dom actually wanting to play as well).  Another part of me just wants to go collapse in the apartment and sleep for a couple of days (I didn't get much sleep over the weekend because...well, because Scott doesn't know how to go to bed before dawn, and I had to wake up relatively early both days I was home).  All of me is just tired of sitting in this damned room.  Oh, I picked up the Flaming Lips album  The Soft Bulletin .  It's a great set, filled with the sort of good stuff you expect from the Flaming Lips--quirky rhythms and instrumentation, cryptic and surreal lyrics, and a throaty yelp for vocals by Wayne Coyne.  Good stuff, and highly recommended.  Tomorrow, Mutual Admiration Society--a collaboration between Glen Phillips (formerly of Toad the Wet Sprocket) and Nickel Creek--is released, and I'm looking forward to that disc (it was recorded three or four years ago, but they couldn't release it because of record company crap.  Highly anticipated in certain circles).  So that's exciting.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Flaming Lips, "Race for the Prize"

       "A Gathering Of Angels Appeared Above My Head"   Well, the Frampton/Styx concert was a pretty good show.  Frampton was rather self-depricating and humorous, and I think he's a little disappointed with his fall from the heights of rockstardom to being a third-tier act who opens for a band like Styx.  Don't get me wrong, his classic stuff is still great, and even some of his newer tunes (he insisted on playing some of them) weren't half-bad, but he's already jumped the shark, really.  Styx was in fine form, though, denying that they've aged at all.  They still act like the young rockers they were when they began, playing epic guitar god as though they were still one of the biggest bands in the world.  It's a little silly seeing the forty-somethings behave like that, striking the poses and all, but they still put on a good show.  Styx weren't just playing music; they were giving a performance, and a rather theatrical one at that.  But I knew more of the Styx tunes than I did the Frampton tunes.  I think I'd have to classify those two bands--and groups like REO Speedwagon--as a sub-genre of classic rock.  Yes, they're all classic rock bands, and decent ones at that, but they're what I'd call "yuppie rock."  It's very polished, somewhat flamboyant and showy stuff.  They go for chugging, epic chord progressions, striking the guitar god poses, and and the lining up and swaying back and forth thing that a certain type of guitarists are wont to do.  This is the style of music that my youngest brother, Scott, prefers to any other.  Myself, I like my rock and roll to be a bit grittier, a bit rougher around the edges.  I don't like it to always be polished to a high sheen, to the point that most of the life and energy is sucked right out of the song.  Some of the stuff Scott listens to is so over-produced, it could have been performed by robots.  No, my tastes tend towards musicians of the Bob Dylan and Van Morrison vein, guys who you know are  very  much alive when they perform.  After all, rock and roll was about energy, enthusiasm, bucking authority and playing it loud, fast, and hard (punk borrowed this later, of course).  Sure, Dylan and Van the Man may have their softer moments, and maybe Dylan started out as an acoustic guitar-strumming folkie, while Van does all the jazz-inflected pop ballads, but they both know how to rock out harder than bands like Styx will ever understand (listen to Dylan's three mid-sixties electric albums, or Van's stuff with Them--you'll know what I mean).  Anyway, the next concert on the list is Dylan and Willie Nelson in September, which I purchased tickets for on Saturday.  I'm excited about that one--I'm an even bigger Dylan fan now than I was the last time I saw him (almost three years ago), so I stand a 50/50 chance of actually knowing most of the songs he plays.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Flaming Lips, "Waitin' for a Superman"

       "And I Don't Know How Much Longer I Can Wait"   Ordered Dylan tickets for me and dad this morning.  They were a bit more expensive than I was given to believe they were, mostly because of handling fees and whatnot.  I swear, you'd think that the fact they charge at least $45 or $50 per ticket already would be enough, but then they add on another ten dollars or so of fees per ticket (ours came to a total of $109.75).  Ah well--I get to see Dylan in September now.  Woot!  Now I must be off.  Gonna hang out with Ev for a while before heading to Shawnee for the night.  Laundry, free food, and being pestered by my youngest brother--another typical Shawnee visit.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Flaming Lips, "Waitin' for Superman"

       "It's Just An Illusion Caused By The World Spinning 'Round"   I've been on a big Flaming Lips/Wilco/Bob Dylan kick the past few days.  It's as though every CD or even song I listen to is by one of those three bands.  I think the next CD I want to buy (after  Mutual Admiration Society , the collaboration between Glen Phillips and Nickel Creek, which comes out next week!) will probably be the Flaming Lips'  The Soft Bulletin .  All the songs I've heard off of it have been excellent; wonderfully crafted epics with tempo shifts, mini-suites, and elegance woven into them.  Went and had lunch with Audrey.  She was charming and bright, as per usual.  I swear, I don't know that girl nearly as well as I'd like, but every time I've encountered her, she's always had a smile on her face and nice things to say about anybody and everybody.  She's a genuinely good person; or, as Everett phrased it (and I think this is probably what I was trying to express when I described her to him), she's a virtuous person.  You don't meet many of them these days, but Audrey is one.  So's Beth, come to think of it--people for whom their convictions are exceptionally important and heartfelt, whose morals and ethics are strong and well-grounded, and who don't let any of that stuff get in the way of being genuinely nice and glad to see people.  I always leave a meeting with people like Audrey feeling like I should be a better person and that I don't deserve to be in their presence.  That's really what it boils down to--there are several people--most of them female--whom I know and feel not only privileged to know, but that I'm somehow not fully worthy of being their friend, that I'm some mucky sewer-dweller who's been granted an audience by a holy person.  I've been playing twenty questions (or a variation thereof) with Mel online most of the evening, just for the fun of it.  Basic stuff, like favorite movies, scariest moments, etc.  It's an amusing diversion from the crap I should be doing.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Flaming Lips, "The Spark that Bled"

       "I Was Chewin' Gum For Something To Do"   Played racquetball today for the first time in a couple of years.  I'd forgotten how much I enjoy that game.  It's a good workout, entertaining, and you leave feeling like you've accomplished something (even if that something is having bashed a small rubber ball against a wall repeatedly).  It's also kinda theraputic (see comment about bashing the ball).  Dom's not real good yet, but then again, this was his first time to play.  I'm sure by the end of the summer, he'll probably be able to beat me, 'cause I'm not really that good.  Pretty quiet day today.  Been sitting here at work, bored out of my mind.  Almost left at 7.00 because I didn't realize it was only 7.00.  I had my bag packed and ready to go, and then glanced up at the clock and realized I still had an hour to go.  I may duck out early anyway, just because I don't feel like sitting here by myself for another half an hour, and I doubt very seriously that anyone will show up.  Talked to Beth briefly today.  She's doing well, it sounds like, and will be heading to the youth camp she always works at during the summer for a couple of weeks this weekend.  She sounds excited, and is apparently glad to be getting the hell out of home for awhile, a sentiment I can easily understand.  I'm starting to try to figure out the logistical issues with the trips I'm taking at the end of the summer.  I'm going to have to come up with the money not only for August's rent, but for gas to get me to Arkansas and back, to Florida and back, for food while I'm in Arkansas and on the way to and from Florida (I'm hoping to convince various friends to cook for me some while I'm in AR, and we're going to try to do the picnic thing my family always does on the trip to Florida), two wedding presents, lodging on the way back from Florida (there's no way I can drive for 18 hours straight by myself), etc.  We also still need to figure out a route for the Florida trip, though I think Dom's already started looking at that.  Tomorrow is payday, thank goodness.  At least this one's a decent check, and I'll be able to deposit over $100 tomorrow (it's sad that I think of that as a "decent check."  I really need more hours).  Tomorrow is also when I'm going to have lunch with Audrey, an old friend from Ozarks who also happens to attend OU (about three or four of us ended up here by chance and coincidence, oddly enough.  It's a small world after all).  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Wilco, "I'm a Wheel"

       "The Evolution of Annoyance"   Remember when you could surf the internet without pop-ups, viruses, and spyware popping up on every page you visited?  Remember when you could check your email without having to sift through hundreds of spam every time?  Do you, in fact, remember when using the internet wasn't something which annoyed you?  Back when I first started frequenting the internet, about the only pages you got pop-ups on were the porn sites (don't ask me how I know this).  Gradually, other sites began including them, 'cause there was money in it.  Then they started coming up with the pop-unders, which are even more annoying because you can't just kill 'em as they come up.  No, you have to fiddle with crap on the taskbar to get to those windows, then you can get rid of them.  Then we got this damn spyware.  I don't know who thought that would be a good idea, but it pisses me off.  And the damn stuff with hijacking one's browser and redirecting it to a different page, or setting your home page as something other than what you wanted it at...it pisses me off.  The point is, it's getting to where surfing the internet is more of an annoyance and a nuisance than something fun anymore.  Email's becoming more hazardous with not only spam, but viruses which masquerade as emails from other people; that can duplicate other people's email addresses and trick you into thinking it's actually something from someone you know.  You can't actually trust anything or anyone anymore, and that's sad.  Even telephones, with their telemarketers and bizzare long distance plans, never had it this bad.  It's really almost as bad as the fact that you have commercials--not previews, freakin'  commercials --before movies at the theatre anymore.  I mean, what the hell?  I went to a movie so I could see the movie  without  commercials!  And I swear, the worst one is that Fanta commercial.  If I ever meet the people who were in or who made that cursed piece of garbage, no one will ever find the bodies...  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: David Gray, "Magdalene"

       "You Stop, You Blink And You're Blue"   I'm having internet issues.  No, not issues with the internet not working--thankfully, the network is behaving quite well, and I have no problem with basic access.  No, the problem is something I cannot understand.  Two problems, really.  The first is that every so often, when I'm trying to load a page (even one out of my favorites), I get redirected to this page labelled "PerfectNav."  When I go to a different page or try to access the page I was originally going to again, it sends a couple of pop-ups, and often just redirects me to the PerfectNav page again.  I've run Ad Aware, and couldn't pick anything up, so I'm buggered if I know what's causing it.  The second problem may or may not be related, though I'm inclined to believe it's unrelated because this was happening long before the PerfectNav stuff started happening.  See, I've arranged my Favorites to my liking.  I've got all the webcomics I read divided up into different folders based on update frequency (those which update seven days a week, those which update five, three, once, sporadically, etc.).  It's a very effective method, since I have so many damn webcomics on my reading list; this way, I know what I need to read and when.  There are other links--most of them not webcomics--which are just out in the Favorites folder and not in any of these sub-folders I created.  Every once in a while (more often now than before), a folder is randomly generated by IE (I assume) that is simply labelled "Links."  It's an empty folder, but it's annoying me because it isn't...tidy, I guess (I'm a neat-freak with things like this.  Not with a bunch of other stuff in my life--say, the condition of my apartment or doing the dishes--but in this, I am).  This wasn't a big deal in the past, because the Links folder would maybe pop up once a month, or every couple of weeks at most.  I'd delete it, and that'd be that.  But now it's popping up virtually every time I open the Favorites folder, and this annoys me.  I keep deleting it every time, and it keeps coming back.  Last night alone (this isn't including the day), I had almost 30 of the damn things.  I don't know if the PerfectNav thing is compounding my problem, or is completely unrelated, but it's really starting to annoy me.  So, yeah, if anyone knows what the hell is wrong here, I'd appreciate hearing from you.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Counting Crows, "American Girls"

       "You're Gonna Carry That Weight"   In light of the previous post, this one seems more...poignant, perhaps?  No, sadder, more disturbing; yes, that's it.  I was at Wal-Mart awhile ago, picking up some random groceries to tide me over until I go home this weekend and raid the cupboard while mom and dad are out of town (hey, I was  told  to...mom said she specifically left some food for me, so there).  Anyway, I'm wandering down the chip aisle, thinking of caving to my craving for Pringles.  As I amble, I come across a mother and her young son (around 10 or so).  To establish the scene:  Wal-Mart, for reasons I do not fully fathom, puts the Slim Fast-type stuff right next to the potato chips.  Same damn aisle.  It's like a way to test and annoy people, I think.  Here we have me, ambling down the aisle in my sandals (which are shoes that're naturally predisposed to creating a shuffling gait, I've noticed-- everyone  shuffles and drags their feet in sandals.  But I digress).  The mother appears to be late-30s, slightly heavyset, but not disgustingly so.  Her son, as previously mentioned, was about ten...and was a plump little butterball.  "Rounded" is a term that comes to mind.  Now, at the age of ten, most kids are kinda stretched out a little more, not so compressed, and pretty scrawny in their post-babyfat years.  Not so this child.  Not only was the babyfat still there, it'd been joined by childfat.  Now, the mother is standing there with her child, talking with him and holding a box.  As I get closer, I see that it's a box of Slim Fast snack bar things.  As I take a sudden interest, I hear that she's trying to convince him to try them.  This gave me pause--a woman thought her son was overweight enough that he needed to take Slim Fast.  My response--which I sadly kept to myself--was "don't give the kid Slim Fast!  Get his fat ass outside and make him run around for awhile instead of playin' freakin' videogames all day!"  Now I'll be the first to admit--as I did earlier today--that I'm rather overweight myself.  But my response to this is to exercise and try to watch what I eat better (yeah, I know, the Pringles aren't the best idea for that, but hey--I rode the bike around campus twice this afternoon in the 100 degree heat index, so I think I deserve a bit of a treat...plus, I'm quitting soda pop tomorrow cold turkey).  I tried Slim Fast a couple of years ago.  All it did for me was leave me feeling hungry every night.  The way those damn things help you lose weight is that they replace a full meal with a 200 calorie drink.  If you reduce the number of calories you're taking in per meal that drastically, of course you'll freakin' lose weight!  You don't have to drink the damn shakes or whatever, just drink a big glass of water or eat a bowl of plain rice instead.  But I think it says something that the woman's response to the problem of her child's weight wasn't to address the root of the issue--his lack of exercise and the fact that he probably drinks soda pop every day and eats too much fast food--but to attempt a band-aid cure for the symptoms.  Most of American society is like that right now, I think.  We see violence in schools, and our response isn't to wonder what psychological reasons are there for these children to want to shoot their classmates, but to look at the videogames these kids were playing or the music they were listening to.  I've been playing violent videogames, listening to angsty music, and watching sex and violence on TV and in the movies for about two decades now, give or take, and I'm sure as hell not about to go out and shoot up my school (though don't think it's not tempting, as assanine as the OU administration is sometimes).  Videogames don't make children violent.  Nor does music, television, or movies.  No, these things have the chance of bringing out violence in those who have such tendencies already, but are not in and of themselves the cause of said violence.  People were brutally murdering each other long before videogames came into existence.  The root of that problem--and the root of the overweight kid at Wal-Mart's problem--lies with the parents, and the fact that parents are not paying enough attention to their damn kids.  If parents would take notice of what sorts of things their children are interested in--the games they want to play, the music they listen to, the movies they see, the people they hang out with--then maybe, just maybe, parents would be able to catch issues before they become problems.  In short, parents ought to be parents, and exercise a bit of interest and control in their childrens' lives.  Letting kids be "free" is one thing, but that sort of hippy clap-trap taken to an extreme by conservative limp baby boomers who are too damn busy counting their money to notice their kid is messed up in the head need a swift kick in the ass.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Elliot Smith, "Alameda"

       "Given The Hopeless Nature Of Our Times"   In a similar vein to Adam's  urlLink comic from last Thursday , I present the following note.  There are certainly some fashions which should not to attempted by folks of a rather...heavy bodyweight.  Just because spandex  can  stretch that far doesn't mean it  should .  And just because they make something in your size, that does not mean you should wear it.  Though there is some question about whether or not it actually "fits" if you're bulging around the edges of the clothing.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, certain folks should not be allowed out in public without clothing; for instace, old and overweight men.  Now admittedly, I'm not the most physically attractive person in the world.  I've got more gut than is necessarily desirable, and I'm out of shape and--not to put too fine a point on it--kinda fat.  But I have the decency to wear a shirt in public, even if it's hot.  I was subjected to a spectacle that no human being should have to endure on the 4th of July, though--old men without shirts.  Wrinkly, rolling skin that could damn-near give its owner a black eye.  And there were  several  men of this nature running around the park in Norman yesterday.  It just ain't right, I'm telling you.  So, in closing, I beg you folks--think about things before you do them.  If your body isn't fit for the human eye, keep your damn shirt on.  I know I am.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Flaming Lips, "Thank You Jack White (for the Fiber-Optic Jesus you gave me)"

       "Somewhere Your Fingerprints Remain Concrete"   Questions to ponder--how is it the people who do crappy webcomics can somehow manage to afford to pay for advertisement?  Why are other comics and sites  allowing  said crappy comics to advertise?  Why is it Adam and I are so damn poor?  If we weren't so poor, we could afford advertising with popular sites.  What advertising would actually get us--aside from the possibility of increased readership, which currently wouldn't mean a whole lot except more readers--is still a question I myself am pondering.  Okay, done with the whiney griping/bitching.  I'm gonna go for a bike ride now.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Dire Straits, "On Every Street"

       "Should've Been In Love"   My uncle's band put on a good show yesterday afternoon, though it was almost too hot to sit out there and listen (even when sitting in the shade).  But they played some good music, and I got fed afterwards, so I wasn't gonna complain.  After the show and dinner, we went back to my aunt and uncle's place and just sat around chatting and playing guitars (well, my uncle and his bandmate Joe played guitars...I made a vain effort to sing a couple of songs, but I'm thinking I need to actually prepare for these things in the future so I don't make a fool of myself).  Also got a call from my mom, though the phone was so staticky that I couldn't hardly understand a word she said, and vice-versa.  But it sounds like they're having fun up in the Pacific northwest, so that's good.   urlLink Dim Bulb Comics  has been added added to a website called  urlLink The Webcomic List , which is a resource that tracks when webcomics update and lists all the updates for a given day.  It also has a function which allows us to put up a synopsis for Dim Bulb, and people can leave comments/reviews of the comic sites.  It's a nifty thing, and I highly recommend it.  They've got over 400 comics listed right now, and some damn fine sites are on there.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Moby, "Extreme Ways"

       "See The Ghost Of Slavery Ships"   Well, went and hung out with my youngest brother last night over at my aunt and uncle's place (where's he's recovering from having surgery on his foot to have some bone spurs removed while my parents are away on vacation).  My aunt and uncle fed me, which is always nice, and it was just a good, relaxing time.  Tomorrow is Independence Day, the day when we celebrate the signing of the Declaration of Independence and our determination to be a self-governing nation.  A lot's happened in the 200+ years since that historic event, but you have to admit--even with the way Dubya keeps trying to stamp on human rights, we are still lucky to live in a country where we can bitch about our leader and not get dragged off in the night and killed by government agents; where we can spend time and energy bitching about having to pay exorbent gas prices for our inefficient SUVs and not have to worry about whether or not we'll have food tomorrow; where we essentially have a constitutionally-guaranteed  right  to bitch and complain as loudly as we want to whomever we want.  As for celebrations, my uncle's band is playing here in Norman tomorrow afternoon, so I'm gonna go down and listen to him play.  For those in the Norman area, it's at Reeve's Park on Jenkins at 4.00 pm.  Old guys rockin' out like teenagers, only without so much whining and angst, and much better guitar solos (my uncle's the lead guitarist).  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Counting Crows, "Up All Night"

       "I Rebound Regardless"   So it's 5.00 am, and for reasons I cannot adequately explain, I'm awake.  What does that mean?  I'm cruisin' the internet for random stuff!  I found  urlLink this article  rather interesting.  I know how some people are going to ignore this and disregard what Cosby is trying to say--they'll call him an Uncle Tom, they'll say he's a white man parading in a black man's skin, and they'll say he doesn't know what it's really like living as a poor black man (ignoring for a moment the fact that Cosby  does , in fact, know exactly what it's like being poor and black).  He's basically saying what needs to be said, if you ask me.  I'm having a hard time articulating this precisely because I'm tired, but in a lot of ways, I think Cosby is right--no one will take you seriously if they can't understand a word coming out of your mouth, or if you can't read or write.  It goes back to some crap I see in the Athletic Department sometimes.  Many of the athletes we have--regardless of race--think that, because they are "star athletes," they don't need to get an education or worry to much about their grades or school, because they'll be going on to play professional fill-in-the-blank sport.  So when the greatest majority of them do not go on to play professionally, they don't have anything to fall back on, and suddenly it's someone else's fault for not telling them this sooner (when all we've done for the previous four or five years was tell them).  Admittedly, part of anyone's chances in life are determined by their heritage.  It's a sad, inescapable fact in modern America.  A well-off middle class white boy probably has more doors open to him initially than a poor black boy.  But only so much responsibility can be placed in such things; eventually, everyone has to own their decisions and choices, and decide what they want out of life.  Saying you want to improve your place in life is one thing; actually doing something about it rather than just waiting for someone to hand it to you because of your race or what my great-great-great grandfather did to yours is pretty damn stupid, if you think about it.  I don't want anyone to read this and think I'm a racist; on the contray, I believe everyone deserves an equal chance in life.  That doesn't mean it should be handed to you or that you shouldn't have to work for it.  The best way to honor the sacrifices of those who came before you to ensure that your life would be better than theirs is to live up to your potential.  This potential does not automatically translate to "the only thing I can do in life is be a star football player."  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Styx, "Come Sail Away"

       "If You've Gots The Poison, I've Gots The Remedy"   I talked with Clif on the phone this evening.  He sounds like he's having a blast in Colorado this summer, what with hiking and the people he's met and whatnot.  Part of me really wishes I was there, and another, smaller part of me is glad I'm not, because I don't know if I could handle another summer living with Clif.  It's hard on a person, believe me...not to mention the fact that here in Oklahoma, I can sleep in past sunrise.  Clif mentioned during our conversation that there was a mountain nearby that had an 18 mile trail on it.  The trail starts at something like eight or nine thousand feet and ends up around 14,000.  As Clif is mentioning this, I say, "Oh, 18 miles should be easy for you to hike.  We did that back in Yellowstone."  His reply was: "Hike?  No, we're gonna  run  up the mountain."  This has me a bit non-plussed.  "Run?"  "Yeah.  I mean, we'll have to slow down a bit when we get the snow, but that's okay."  Keep in mind that said snow is currently probably about as tall as I am in some places near the top.  I think this is a good argument for the case against my brother still being sane.  This sort of thing will be worked into a comic somehow during the course of the summer.  I'd be amiss in my duties as a cartoonist and a humorist to not do so, especially since I'm still right in the middle of the Yellowstone Saga, which is a semi-ficticious account of Clif and I's summer in Yellowstone National Park.  Only half that stuff's made up (mostly the stuff with the archangel and...well, really, that's about it).  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Wilco, "Jesus Etc."

       "August And Everything After"   Made it to Clarksville okay.  Heather's wedding went well on Saturday--everything looked good, we had no calamaties or casualties, and it was endearing to see the groom break down in tears when the bride walked into the sanctuary.  Gave me a much higher opinion of him.  It also set all the bridesmaids to crying, which set off the mothers.  But a lovely wedding all the same.  Stayed over at my friend Karen's house Sunday night up in Little Rock.  I hadn't realized that it'd been over a year since I'd seen her.  She's doing well, but I think she's ready to start school back again.  Monday, I left Karen's place and headed to Clarksville.  I was supposed to crash at Amanda Webster's place, but I couldn't get ahold of her.  I tried calling about two dozen times, but her cellphone is apparently messed up.  Anyway, I ended up crashing at Adam's parents' place instead, where it looks like I'll spend the rest of the week (since Amanda had to go back home for her brother's surgery earlier this evening).  But that's okay--it just means I'm closer to where I need to be for wedding stuff.  Preparations for Adam and Andria's wedding on Friday are going well.  The reception hall is already decorated, and they'll prepare the sanctuary for the ceremony tomorrow evening after church.  Found out that several of my favorite people at Ozarks won't be returning in the fall.  Reverend Woodard (the school chaplain), Jeff Blackard (a coordinator over in the Learning Center and one of the coolest guys on earth), and a half dozen other employees were all let go at the end of the spring semester for various reasons, mostly related to budget apparently.  It just saddens me to realize that some of the people who made Ozarks the special place it was for me won't be there anymore.  Anyway, tomorrow (today) I need to go visit my old advisor and mentor, Dr. Dippel.  I'm in dire need of some sagelike advice, and my current advisor (while an intelligent man, a great historian, and a nice enough guy) isn't really helping me all that much (especially with being out of town and all).  Hopefully Dippel will be able to provide me with some useful guidance...or he may just be sarcastic.  It's always hard to tell with him.  Things to do still while here in Clarksville: 1) Visit Dippel 2) Get tuxes (they'll supposedly be ready tomorrow...we hope) 3) Attend rehersal and wedding 4) Visit with Amanda Erisman (hopefully happening Thursday and/or Friday...I miss that girl dearly and haven't gotten to see her yet) 5) Rock the house Simple enough list, right?  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Wilco, "War on War"
