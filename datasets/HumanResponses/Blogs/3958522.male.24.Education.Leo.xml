      Does anyone else think it's odd that Coldplay has been mentioned TWICE in house&nbsp;church settings?&nbsp;

      I was fortunate enough to visit Aaron and Christina's church tonight.&nbsp; Here's how it went down.&nbsp; Christine and&nbsp;I arrive a little early and met a few people in the kitchen with Aaron sitting in the family room.&nbsp; The whole room was full of chairs with a few candles lit.&nbsp; A few more people shuffled through the door.&nbsp; Christina showed up around seven and started cooking ziti pasta with shrimp.&nbsp; There about 3 girls I've never really met, along with a few others I'm just getting to know.&nbsp; About a dozen were there.&nbsp; Eventually dinner was served and the kitchen got crowded with people just conversing as the line was served.&nbsp; They had an actual dinner table set up in the next where a small group of people gathered for the meal.&nbsp; The rest of us sat in the family room.&nbsp; It was delicious!&nbsp; I think everyone had seconds.&nbsp; The conversations continued, mostly in pairs or groups of three.&nbsp; No one was left out.&nbsp; Christina then brought out some Italian cheesecake.&nbsp; MMMMM . .&nbsp;. boy!&nbsp;   Once everyone finished up, Aaron welcomed everyone and had Tyler read the central prayer of their house church.&nbsp; Then the music started.&nbsp; Michael Whitehouse started strumming "Everything" by Coldplay and "Let everything that has breath" by Sixpence.&nbsp; Everyone sang along.&nbsp; Three girls stood off the side at the entrance of the hallway dancing.&nbsp; Others bopped their heads with their eyes closed.&nbsp; The voices billowed with brief prayers between songs.&nbsp; We even got to be quiet and listen to God.&nbsp; Jen (new girl) sang a short line from a Shane Bernard song.&nbsp; It was sweet.&nbsp; She sang it over and over and asked others to join in and they did.&nbsp; Evenually Ali picked up her guitar and led a few songs with her breathy, soothing&nbsp;voice.&nbsp; I was blown away by her ability to, not only sing, to not only play a good rhythm, but to really lead people with subtle direction.&nbsp; Her enthusiasm and heart-felt words made me want to sing!&nbsp; Aaron fathered the group well, addressing the group then he needed to&nbsp;and letting it go and do its own thing.&nbsp; This church definitely has a strong streak of Charismatic flavor, probably more than most house churches we will see at The Shack.  I couldn't stay for the teaching, but before I left I couldn't help but interupt them with an encouragement.&nbsp; They wouldn't let me leave without gathering around me and praying for me.&nbsp; I was sad to go.&nbsp; It was as if I was being sent to war.&nbsp; It was family.&nbsp;  And that was my first visit to a Shack Community house church.&nbsp; It is very clear that each house church is going to be SO unique from all the others.&nbsp; This excites me.&nbsp; These things are going to touch so many different types of people.&nbsp; It is as it should be.

      I think thats how you could look at these first three house churches . . . a 3-lane highway.&nbsp; Again, you three are the only house churches that will spontaniously start from nothing.&nbsp; You're unique.&nbsp; All other house churches will be born out of you, or born out of the ones you start.&nbsp; This week we started publicizing the house churches to the entire ministry.&nbsp; Here's what that means: you'll be handling a lot of traffic, kind of like a 3-lane highway.&nbsp; For the next couple weeks you're going to get congested.&nbsp; A lot of people are curious about these things, and want to get involved.&nbsp; This is going to be frustrating because it threatens your initial relationships in house church.&nbsp; Matt Callis was telling me that he really longs for their house church to be a "club", but he knows that isn't worth very much because it ignores other people, and pretends like God has no plans.&nbsp; He's learning that there is a vast difference between a club and a church.  I want to assure all of you, that things will settle.&nbsp; Intially, the traffic is going to be heavy and your house churches will be congested.&nbsp; However, as they get crowded there comes the need to multiply and have babies.&nbsp; When the churches reach their numeric limit it will be time to start a new one.&nbsp; This is adding a forth lane to the highway.&nbsp; It will divert traffic and accomodate a consistant momentun for those traveling on it.&nbsp; There's no way we could accomodate dozens of new people a week to seek a house church if we only have 3 house churches.&nbsp; You have to multiply or die.&nbsp; I forsee us being a six-lane highway in a matter of weeks.&nbsp; When you start a new house church you will be losing a handful of people, even some that are close to you.&nbsp; Remember that starting a house church doesn't mean splitting the current one.&nbsp; Wolfgang called that a divorce.&nbsp; It only takes 3 people to rise up and start a new work.&nbsp; Proudly send those people out and let them do what God is calling them to.&nbsp;   From&nbsp;now until the first couple weeks of the semester the number of people pouring through house churches will only get larger.&nbsp; However, if we continually start new ones as we go all that congestion will disappear, the dust will settle and you'll still have an intimate core group of friends in your house church.&nbsp; You guys are catalysts for something bigger than yourselves.&nbsp; If we're willing to be that, we will see the church operate like water, flowing where gravity takes it and saturating everything it touches.

      We had our first house church last Friday night and we had a blast.&nbsp; People started showing up around 7 and we got to work cooking dinner right away.&nbsp; The kitchen was a little crowded but so much fun.&nbsp; Coldplay was going in the background and conversation was jammed into the spaces between "do you have any onions for the sauce?" and other cooking comments.&nbsp; After the temperature in the room finally reached a point of "oh my gosh, I have to get out of here!" we all stood back and admired our spread on the dining room table.&nbsp; Christmas lights were strung all around the room and the meal was stunning.&nbsp; We dug in and had really, really comfortable conversation while we chowed&nbsp;down.&nbsp; We never even prodded the subject of house - it just came out.&nbsp; We never prodded the subject of tithing either - it also came up in conversation.&nbsp; Some people came and ate and then left after dinner, and some of us stuck around.&nbsp; We prayed very different prayers about our house church but they were all unified.&nbsp;   Our house church centers around preparing a meal together for several reasons.&nbsp; One, it's always weird when you walk into a place from your day and you're expected to suddenly meet the atmosphere that's been set up.&nbsp; It's like jumping out of a hot tub and into a cold pool.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because&nbsp;spiritual vulnerability is involved, we wanted people to create their own atmosphere of safety, not just assure them that it's there.&nbsp; As we prepare a meal together, everyone gets to unwind and joke around.&nbsp; The day kind of melts away when the smell of good food is in the air.&nbsp;   Two, we're getting the chance to learn each other.&nbsp; You can tell so much about someone from the way they cook - like are they hygienic? ... Just kidding.&nbsp; But we learn how to work with, approach, and help one another.&nbsp; Cooperation becomes easy.&nbsp; We also learn different ways to cook things and secrets we may never have known since none of us have cable with the FoodNetwork.&nbsp; We began forming as a group - creating our own inside jokes and winding down together.&nbsp;   Three, when dinner's fixed, we've accomplished something together.&nbsp; We've decorated a room, set a table, made a place for everyone to sit, cranked the air way up, and created a feast.&nbsp; We've just become a team and our separate days have merged into one.&nbsp; As we sit down, everyone's comfortable with the mood and we all know we're in a safe place.&nbsp;   Voila!&nbsp; The vulnerability we hoped for was established.&nbsp; &nbsp;

         Well, our first meeting was Tuesday night, and all in all, I’d have to say it went swimmingly.    There were five people, plus Oreos and coffee.    The bulk of the time was spent discussing the shape we see the group taking and what we desire both from this church and from God.    We did arrive at a few basic conclusions:     Wendy      and I are leaders only in the loosest sense possible.    The members of this church own it, and will      take ownership as such.   The      church will grow no larger than about 10.         After that, a new church will be planted.   There      won’t be a planned lesson.    Everyone      is responsible for bringing something about their life and relationship      with God that they’d like to talk about.         That doesn’t mean that we’ll talk about everything everyone brings,      just that we’ll have plenty of fodder for a lively and productive      discussion.          That’s about it.    There was prayer and fellowship and discussion of cartoons afterward.    All in all, a lovely night, and one with which I sincerely hope God was pleased.

      One thing that is becoming more and more apparent is that people will choose their house church based upon the day of the week it is meeting.&nbsp; We simply can't accomodate the schedules of everyone we're connected with.&nbsp; Matt and Lou's house church is much smaller than they first thought because of that very fact.&nbsp; They just couldn't satisfy everyone's availability.&nbsp; There's nothing wrong with that, in fact it&nbsp;excites me.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because its something beyond your control as parents.&nbsp; It is totally dependant on the providence of God.&nbsp; Yes, God may be sending you&nbsp; specific people arbitrarily based upon&nbsp;what nights they're off of work.&nbsp; Let's sit back and let the Kingdom unfold as it will.  Currently, we have one house church meeting on Tuesday nights and two meeting on Wednesday nights.&nbsp; You Wednesday folks: is there any way one of you may be able to meet on Thursday nights instead?&nbsp; It's just a suggestion.&nbsp; This&nbsp;would put each of you in a unique position to receive a unique group of people.&nbsp; It makes sense&nbsp;for our first three house churches.&nbsp; For any house churches that may multiply out of you, it really wouldn't matter what night they would meet.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm just trying&nbsp;trying to load the&nbsp;bases during this first wave!&nbsp;  In Vegas the most popular night for house church meetings was Friday night, believe it or not.&nbsp; I suppose it makes sense since on Friday nights we enjoy spending time with&nbsp;our friends.&nbsp;   Keep in mind that all other House Churches are going to likely develop out of you three!&nbsp; Therefore, if you would feel comfortable, would you guys mind us advertising your House Church meeting times?&nbsp; There are dozens of people in Columbia waiting to get invited to one.&nbsp; What do you think would be the best way to go about that?  Oh yeah, what are your house church names?&nbsp; I think the simplest thing to do is name them after your location.&nbsp; I believe Matt and Lou's is The Church @ 719 Henderson.&nbsp; It's&nbsp;simple, to the point and&nbsp;uninstitutionalized.  Comments?  &nbsp;

      For the sake of discussion, what are your thoughts about keeping your group open to those God sends you.&nbsp; House churches tend to be very inward, which is quite a liability in the&nbsp;Kingdom.&nbsp; In fact, I helped create that habit with the whole CLIQUE thing.&nbsp; But as we've said before, if you close your group off then&nbsp;you may be&nbsp;working against God, and you're really not a church.&nbsp; I believe we will see all sorts of people drawn to these. . . probably drawn by God.&nbsp; How do you expect to accomodate those he sends to you?&nbsp; How does someone become part of your family?&nbsp; I suppose it's like&nbsp;a bunch of orphans adopted into a loving&nbsp;home.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Example: so lets say a small group of you were&nbsp;adopted a long time ago.&nbsp; Luckily, over time, you've been drawn into a very loving family with your adopted siblings and loving father.&nbsp; So you get comfortable.&nbsp; All of the sudden . . . your adopted fathered ushers another child into the home, perhaps several.&nbsp; As a bunch of siblings, once orphaned,&nbsp;later adopted into a new family, how will you respond to the new kids God has brought into his home?&nbsp; Be mindful of the parable of sower in Matthew 13.

      Parents: &nbsp; I'm taking off to Myrtle Beach for the week with the family.&nbsp; However, I'll try to access the net as often as I can, so maybe you'll hear more from me. &nbsp; I looks like the first house church has already taken place.&nbsp; Aaron and a handful of others gathered last week.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Aaron:  it would be cool if you could share about the evening (i.e. who was there, what happened, what you learned).&nbsp; That would be so helpful to everyone else.&nbsp; We're all learning here. &nbsp; Matt and Lou will be starting their's this weekend.&nbsp; It seems they've decided to wrap their house church around preparing a meal together, instead of just providing them.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Matt and Lou:  share with everyone your reasoning behind that. &nbsp; JP and Wendy should starting theirs very soon. &nbsp; Its important that these first three house churches to be rather established by the end of the month.&nbsp; August 14th the freshman are arriving, and the next night is our first "REUNION".&nbsp; Add all the other Shackers returning to town, there will be a lot of people looking to belong to a family.&nbsp; Therefore, over the next few weeks try to find your groove (i.e. meeting time, core group and spiritual habits of the community). &nbsp; &nbsp;

       I hope you'll all forgive the long post.  If you can't forgive it, just ignore it.  Our house church had its first communion two Wednesdays ago.  I didn't really know what to think or to write about it immediately.  It was something about which I was very unsure initially.  Before we had communion, I communicated about it with a friend of mine who is a pastor in my own tradition (PCA).  He advised against having communion in a setting absent of elders or anyone ordained.  His advice was well-reasoned and scriptural, but he didn't claim it was authoritative for, in his words, "...there are legitimate and principled reasons for people with integrity and a love for Christ and the Scriptures to disagree..."  Ultimately, we did have communion (if you're interested in those issues feel free to email me), and I think now, after reading this passage from Annie Dillard in  Holy the Firm  I'm ready to write about it.     The churchwomen all bring flowers for the altar; they haul in arrangements as big as hedges, of wayside herbs in season, and flowers from their gardens, huge bunches of foliage and blossoms as tall as I am in vases the size of tubs, and the altar still looks empty, irredeemably linoleum, and beige. We had a singer once, a guest from another congregation, a girl with chopped hair and big shoulders and a long lacy dress who sang, grinning, an entirely secular song about mountains. Nothing could have been more apparent than that God loved this girl; nothing could more surely convince me of God’s unending mercy than the continued existence on earth of the church.  The higher Christian churches - where, if anywhere, I belong - come at God with an unwarranted air of professionalism, with authority and pomp, as if they knew what they were doing, as though people in themselves were an appropriate set of creatures to have dealings with God. I often think of the set pieces of liturgy as certain words which people have successfully addressed to God without their getting killed. In the high churches they saunter through liturgy like Mohawks along a strand of scaffolding who have long since forgotten their danger. If God were to blast such a service to bits, the congregation would be, I believe, genuinely shocked. But in the low churches you expect it at any minute. This is the beginning of wisdom.    My friend's warnings, along with those in the Bible, led me to take communion, not just with reverence, but with a feeling just shy of terror.  Yes, I know that we are to "approach the throne of grace with confidence", but the awareness that to take the sacraments with the wrong heart will bring judgement was heavy upon me.  This may seem like a bad thing, but I think that it was just about the best thing that could have happened, and it points to a magnificent feature of these house churches.  Communion is easy to take "at church".  There's a minister/priest there to bless everything and (hopefully) to warn you of the danger that comes with taking the bread and wine.  That official, though, does, if only seemingly, stand between me and the sacrament.   He's  in charge of it.   He  has  to make sure everything goes right.  All I have to do is take the wafer and the tiny plastic cup.   In our communion, I have to stand before God alone--as a sinner, as an individual--recognizing that His body was broken and His blood was shed, and ask for my part in the forgiveness that those things bought.  If God did blast us all to bits I could hardly blame Him, but He didn't.  Thank God that we do have an intermediary--only one--whose blood covers all the sins that make me totally deserving of eternal destruction, whose blood we partook in, and who we remember through the sacrament.

         9:00 AM        I wake up this morning just like any other Sunday morning. I didn’t wake up at a certain time because I don’t have a morning church to go to. Not that they are all bad, I just don’t have it in me to go to a morning service. Well today is one of those days that my creative and energetic God is asking me to do something totally different and outrageous. He asked me to go to church. “Why God?” is my first question, as I entertain thoughts of a big sweaty man shaking my hand at the front door and Saturday Night Live’s Dana Carvey’s character impersonation of church lady who tells everyone that they are in with satan. “Do I have to wear a tie God,” I ask?             So God is asking me to go to St. John’s Episcopal Church this morning. Yes that’s right, Jehovah God in all his infinite post-modern wisdom is asking me, an semi-anti-traditionalist, house church leader, and progressive thinker, to go sit, kneel, and look at man in a strange dress (actually turned out to be a woman) who plasters his hair to his head and raises his right hand a lot to look like the Jesus of Renaissance art. How do I know it’s going to be this way? Well I must tell you that I was Episcopal for the first 7 years of my life until the Baptists showed me the way to true abundant life through their bearded preacher with khakis. Oh yeah, remember that Baptist preacher who had that infamous stain on their shirt from one of his many kids, which turns into an illustration about why we need to be saved?             Now I am wondering what to expect. I have about an hour to talk myself out of going.    If I don’t go, I won’t have to miss my Sunday morning meditation coffee event. St. John’s Episcopal Church here I come with tie, a semi-forced smile, and shiny black shoes. I bet a ton of pretty rich girls are going to be there too.                  9:17 AM        All sarcasm aside, I am expecting to find God in a really cool and new way this morning. If I didn’t, it wouldn’t be worth posting this long story on blogger.              12:26 PM (as told as if it was 10:30 AM)     I arrive first admiring the art work/ stained glass. My senses are mildly focused on the atmosphere and majorly focused on the experiences of those around me. Catholic churches are much more extravagant. For the most part people weren’t happy. “This ain’t no house church,” I keep saying to myself. Surprisingly there are very few girls to look at, and even less single 20 somethings. Perhaps this is telling of the relevance of this church structure to its family and even more telling of my intentions here.              There is meaning in those stain-glass windows as each window had a theme. The themes range from a super-spiritual Jesus with winged lions and cows, angels, and flaming swords in the panes to carpenter Jesus with wheels, steamboats, some funky looking pipe, and an airplane. I am actually really impressed that art was used in a creative way. The church at 2500 Preston has pictures of Brittany and Madonna kissing, a girl drinking Dawn, someone pouring laundry detergent in a gas tank, and a Canadian love song singer giving the thumbs up.               Scripture reading is the really depressing stuff from Ecclesiastes and the whole service is centered on how all riches and high-class comforts are vanity and selfish, although this of course is never directly said. I get very emotional because it is obvious that Jesus is not being admired, adored, and given honest attention that he should get in church.              I take communion. It is wine! The church at 2500 Preston St. should have wine.               At the very beginning of the service I watch a thirty year old mother sit down on the opposite end of the pew I am on. She gives her small son to Dad and kneels to pray before the service. This reminds me of going to Church of the Redeemer Episcopal when I was five, and kneeling beside my moma as she prayed before the service started. Daddy was in church about half of the time, so it was natural for me to be doing exactly what moma was doing. I can remember the passion in my moma’s prayers even then, as I vaguely can see her praying with tears in her eyes. You see my mom found God in those two or three years. Now I am finding God in these years as a result. I don’t give credit to that church or to my Mom’s necessity for God through her degrading marriage, but to a God who works beyond church structure to the heart of His loved children. I believe with all my heart that you can go to St. John’s Episcopal Church, hear the voice of the Lord while you are there, and create community centered on Jesus. I thank the Lord that is bigger than our ideas of church.
