      it took me 4eva to fall asleep last night. i didnt fall asleep till 3am. i hate tossing and turning. i woke ^ @ 8 this morning which was later than i had wanted to bcuz i wanted to call ali. however i didnt hear nathan arrive so there went that. @ 8am i went down stairs got advil and orange juice and then went back up to my room. i figured that ali wud be calling netime cuz i hadnt called her. so i laid down again and was 'resting my eyes'. i guess i fell back to sleep caz she called and i didnt hear the fone ring. had i, i wudve answered it. i feel bad. we were supposed to go to the mall. mayb we can go afta she gets the glass outa her foot. i feel like shit, im exhausted and my allergies are effectively preying on me. grrrrr...  --xoxo
