       I'm not sure how this will develop.  I've been keeping a journal lately called "Conversations with God"; yes, I know that's the title of a book, but I've never read that book and I don't think I can get sued for a personal journal title.    Anyway, I keep this journal after I pray in the morning.  This is something my spiritual director suggested (and who am I to have a spiritual director?), and I find it really meaningful to see how I've grown and changed over, say, a month.  Inevitably, a theme emerges when I look back over these conversations and I become clear about where and how God is moving in my life.    So, what about moving the journal, which is now on my hard drive, to a blog?  Somehow, putting it out into the universe, or at least the world wide web, makes it seem more real.    Or more insane, depending on your point of view.

       I've been silent because I've been&nbsp;busy, not because there hasn't been any conversation.&nbsp; I've continued to keep my own private journal to and about God.&nbsp; I talk to God as I pack boxes, preparing for my move from one condo to another.&nbsp; I talk to God on my walks.&nbsp; I talk to God as I write my journal&nbsp; and as I meet with my spiritual director.&nbsp; What I haven't allowed as much is time for God to answer.&nbsp; That's my new determination--talk less, listen more.&nbsp; But even in my overly busy and hectic life, God has spoken through the relationships in my life--my strong relationship with my partner, my growing network of friends at church--and through allowing me to stay spiritually calm during stressful moments--my degree confusion, my waiting for my future to be revealed.&nbsp;

      Funnily enough, I spent the morning reading student essays.  And it's summer.  Summer vacation.  I'm supposed to be reading novels, lying on the beach and hanging with friends at Starbuck's (scratch Starbuck's, insert "quaint, locally owned coffee shop).  Instead, I'm reading essays.    Why?  Because the myth that teachers only work nine months out of the year is just that, a myth.  We get paid for ten months, actually, for teaching from mid-August through mid-June, but we often work during the summer: planning the upcoming year; reading everything we can get our hands on, looking for exciting things for our students to read and for interesting tidbits to share with our students; and, if we teach AP English in any form, reading student essays and replying to students' e-mails about their summer assignments.    I teach AP Language and Composition, which, as its name implies, focuses on how writers use language and on how to write better.  That's a very simple description; I'm sure the people at AP would like something a bit more sophisticated, but there it is.  For anyone who has taken a freshman composition in college, you know what this is: boring.  So, my job is to teach this course to high school seniors and help prepare them to take the AP test at the end of the year; the test, by the way, is much more difficult than anything I had students do when I taught freshman comp. at Indiana University.  The second part of my job, then, is to make the course interesting enough that high school seniors will want to read essays from the Renaissance and to write essays analyzing other people's writing, among other things.  My motivational strategy includes great gobs of enthusiasm from me and lots of snacks.  Hey, snacks go a long way to inspiring people.

      As an English teacher for the past 11 years (3 as an associate instructor at Indiana University while working on my master's and 8 at a Catholic girls high school), I have focused my attention on the printed page, printed meaning paper.  But now I find I want a broader way to communicate, both with students and friends.  I don't promise anything overly witty or insightful.  I do promise my honest reflections on my teaching, my students, the state of English teaching and teaching in general and on things I'm reading.  Who knows what else may follow?

      Well, I have been reading and&nbsp;commenting on&nbsp;papers from my AP English students this summer and meeting with teachers from my AP and English IV teams to plan the courses, but I have also taken a lot of time to read.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's part of my job as a teacher, too.&nbsp; How can I talk to students about literature and the joys of reading if I'm not reading and keeping up with new trends in the literary world?&nbsp; And, needless to say, I&nbsp;want to read, I want to have the time to read for hours at a time, which isn't possible during the school year when I have to sneak in 15 or 30 minutes of reading at a time.&nbsp; So this summer I tackled  Anna Karenina  (disclaimer: I decided to read it BEFORE Oprah chose it as her summer book), which I imagined would read like one of Dostoevsky's novels, but it is much more like a big, sprawling English novel of the 19th century.&nbsp; Many different plot lines, lots of details.&nbsp; I ended up loving the character Levin and his wife Kitty much more than Anna herself.&nbsp; AK took quite a long time to read--all those details about Russian agricultural practices really slowed me down--and when I finished I swept through novel after novel.&nbsp;  What Was She Thinking  by Zoe Heller and  Truth & Beauty  by Ann Patchett were particularly good; I sat down and read each in a day.&nbsp; Now I'm onto  Brick Lane  by Monica Ali.&nbsp; I like to read the Booker Prize winners each year.&nbsp; But the upcoming school year looms so soon I'll need to turn to the novels I'm teaching this semester so I'm&nbsp; a few steps ahead of my students.
