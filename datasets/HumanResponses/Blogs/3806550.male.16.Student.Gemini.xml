      Maybe just maybe. . That once in my purgitory life something will go right. This epiphany, I wish is the truth. Could this be telling me to go another path? That I should conflict with current faults and disapate the cold harsh reality of the present? Should I move on towards it? With this Unbreakable bond and concentrated emotion of bliss tells me to enable my opinions towards it and progress towards it. Well, the only way of telling so is to wait. Maybe just maybe. .

      I just had an epiphany at 3:00 in the morning! Something came to me, a sudden strike of understanding. For that, I am so much happier! Life seems to be so uncongested and remains its integrity. What restricted my minds eye into not seeing this jubilant happening! It was all one big plan from when I was born and I didn't even realize it til now! I even talked about it when I was younger and I still didn't even see it. It is unraveling. .

      People must comprehend the compensation of unsatisfactory lives. That is all an opinion based confinedment. People think that they arn't dilligent and can't comply with teenager confontations, such as relationships. I knowing a surplus of female psyche because of growing up with a lot, that affected my life. This Changed me, knowing how they feel and what they think. But, when It comes to relationships, they cover it with some pheromonic stimulant to males brains which I can't surpass. Basically, I'm saying girls are weird! It is hard for me to like someone with so much emotion. A bond or connection consists of two interloping emotions. The games girls play! If you have a great feeling for someone let them know! Don't hide it, If there is something just say it! I also witnessed that if a friend of someone likes a person that likes their friend. That someone ignores them, it finally unrolled in my head. That's tough, just cause one of your friends likes someone, doesn't mean you dont get the right to have feelings for them. That's harsh, eh?

      Life is funny just because just when It seems to be inherenting a blissful adment. It's inturupted by a dreadful dismay. Especially when those "Love Triangles" among friends appear, just like Keith, Shannon, and I. I got to thinking, I'm only 16 freaking years old. I don't want to hurt anybody else or lose friends such as Keith. I'm not saying I don't care for Shannon anymore, oh I do! To much to endure! I would do anything for her. She needs to stop being so self-conscious. All girls do honestly. Shannon is so inherently beautiful. Even in her "Bad Years" I find her just so adorable. We are just friends, and If she ever has those feelings for me again, she needs to tell me. Yes, everyone will say get over her. I am! In a way. But, I'm telling you I will never stop loving her.

      I'm so very hostile right at this exact moment. I can't sleep; the time is 12:06 am on the 24th of May. My whole relationship with Shannon is putting me through hell. She upsets me with the contradicting acts she puts forth, She's antagonizing me! I was so very upset when we broke up; I held all of the morbid emotion in. Confining me to petulance. Her devotion to this Ill-fated charade constricts my patience. I thought I really got to know Shannon on the trip to King's Island, where I was brutally depressed, overcome with thoughts of fictitious complexities. I burrowed into a deep confined hole distributed in my soul, telling in specific detail how demented and destroyed my life has become and as well my feelings toward her. I felt this created a connection, finally a real conversation between the both of us. But, It was only a beneficiary mirage of hope. She told me that mystifying dark altered evening, that her feelings for Keith and I were distributed evenly accordingly to her passion. How could she like someone so raucous and repugnant? Frow what I heard, this malicious dependent of a person's mother evidently said that Shannon is putting her poor son through a life of dismay. F*&%@$^ S*#$! If that kid is so stubborn and indulged upon himself and believes his life is so hard! F@%^ Him! Especially knowing the fact that he had to patsy Greg for his Espionage practiced upon I and Kelly's conversation on the long bus ride home. Shannon didn't even seem to to care when Marti told her. Her expression was quite pitiful, I was shocked. I thought Shannon was different; at least she knew better or asked him if that was true. I don't understand how you can like someone that cordially obliges himself to that certain extent. Although, I know she doesn't have feelings for me and you might ask how do I know for sure? Well if she did have feelings for me like she said, she wouldn't put me through this. She does more with Keith than I. Although I know for sure I care for her so much more than him. She won't even talk to me unless I start the conversation, nor look into my eyes when talking. She ignores me completely, changes the subject nontheless. But, when she is around Keith she would no doubtfully talk to him or massage his shoulders. . . So why does she play me so? She is playing me with a vengeance, passion, and creative configuration. I started to comtemplate these feelings, but I love her so much. I don't want to lose her, but she is screwing up royally. She doesn't disserve me (as so I'm told), and trust me I'm a pretty good guy. Unlike Keith and his outrageous temper of his. But, there is nothing I can do to make that change. That night when I saw them eloping in the hot tub together, unleashed the most massive of feelings possibe. God bless Melinda and Amber that night for comforting me, the sheaded tears for her probably meant nothing to Shannon. But, Iguess I'm the one being immature about the whole resolution. Maybe, I just think I have it so bad. Just because at age 6 my 5 yr old sister got hit by a bus, me being home from school sick could of died as well. . . I would have been right behind her. . Then shortly afterward my Grandfather committed suicide over the incident of my sister with a shotgun to the head. Then the next year I lost a cousin to a head on collision car accident. then the next year lost a cousin over a purely evil sickness called meningitis. Then the next year my friend died of cancer. Then the nnexy year my mother dies. . Someone you truly depend on, why my mother? Why!? Why does everyone I truly care about, always leave me. My mother was the coolest mother of all, she tought everything and how to just to have fun in life. She knew everything as well, she was my best friend, a person that was always there when I needed to talk to or cry on her shoulder. But, then one day she was gone. . . I've been to three different schools because of numerous reasons, been treated so harshly by everyone. It seems there is no care in the world, no one out there that loves me. Yeah I still have my dad, but he always has to fight with me every chance he's got. He doesn't come to my games, meets, and concerts. He doesn't support anything I do. But, there are my brothers that are the biggest aspirations in my life. Dustin 21, The Intellegent Work Ethic and Derek 19, The Intelligent Athletic. Both are really cool people and get me through my life. Mostly everyone at Decatur treats me with hostility and disrespect. I always get slandered or falsely accused by everyone all the time. I don't know why my life is so cursed, I was just one kid caught in a domino effect that affected my life tremendously but, I guess I'm wrong. What do you think?
