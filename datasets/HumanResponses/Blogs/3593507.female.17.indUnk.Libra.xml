      Today I think I had my first morning sickness. I woke up and puked twice then a few hours later.. puked again. :/  I went to work today and found out that a friend of mine who is an RN has breast cancer. They think they've caught it in time though. I hope so...  After work I went home and showered and napped. Then, I drove the 50 miles to my fiance's house and we had dinner. I also told him  I was pregnant.. actually he guessed.  Him: want some wine? Me: No I can't Him: why you pregnant *laugh* Me: actually yes I am Him: you are what? Me: pregnant I found out a few days ago Him: are you sure? Me: yes Him: oh my god Me: I'm about 8 weeks Him: I guess we better hurry with this wedding then  After that we didn't really talk much about it. After I came home i got on the computer and pissed some people off (not on purpose). My grandmother pissed me off...again. That's about it.

      Well, I guess I will post about my memorial day weekend. Yeah, I'm a little late but that's ok. Saturday night a local marina (4 miles from me) had a big concert/eat thing. Well, almost everyone was drunk by 11 pm including the band (excluding me because I hate alcohol). Anyways, the singer of the band (crappy country/rock/blues band) fell off the stage!! IT was sooooooo funny. Lucky it was just a 2 foot high stage. Well, my friend Rusty told me I HAD To sing so he went up to the band and told them and they made me come up. I ended up singing 5 songs...  1. Papa drove a truck (lol) 2. Whose bed have your boots been under 3. Old time rock and roll 4. boot scootin boogie (a duet with the original singer) 5. Divorce  It was so much fun. Some little kid asked for an autograph. I, of course, didn't refuse but I was laughing while I was signing.    *Note to self: Get Teri's Address    Ok, back to life as it is now.. Today I worked. I still haven't told anyone about the baby because I'm kind of scared. Anyways, I guess that's all.

      A funny little topic going on down at teen hole.  Me: ok.. so lemme make everything clear ...........   bmxnangelbabe is my daugher so I *pwn* her. I *pwn* blazeshark's tongue and something else (they're all mine bitches mwhahah) blazeshark *pwn*s me and everything I *pwn* cuz of his sexahness.  Anja: Wow.. I just realized im a Super Moderator.   Me: maybe it's cuz i just now made you one   my b00b itches   Anja: YAY! Oh, and by the way, that was WAY too much information.   Me: I have fleas.. they're invisible and were previously owned by george w. bush   IMANALIEN: can you e-mail me one   Me: Sorry, they're mine and I'm greedy!   IMANALIEN: figures. well, if they have babies, will you send me one?   Me: I'm so sorry, they're sterile       Haha, the stuff we talk about there. It's fun to have a board you don't have to worry about someone banning you for being stupid.   Anyways... today I caught up on my sleeping. I slept a lot. Tomorrow I have to work, that should be fun. I'm so lucky to have my job. Hmm.. I guess I will rant about the internet now.  My favorite website is my own I suppose http://www.teehole.tk closely followed by  urlLink PB Support2 . Photoshop is messed up, again. :sigh:. I guess I need to reinstall it.... again.

      Today I am off work. I've been so tired the past few days because I get up at 4 am and ususally don't go to bed until 2 am. So, today is sleep day! I'm going to tell my baby that I'll be having one today. I hope he takes it well. Right now I'm eating cheese crackers because i'm too lazy to cook.

      Today I was at work and I was working (duh). Well, at lunch Chris (OBGYN) and his wife Lauren and I were having lunch. We ordered chinese from somewhere I can't remember exactly where. After I got home I cleaned. I was sooo tired (I drive 50 min to work) so I went to sleep.  Yeah, boring day huh?  Except this morning I found out I'm 7 weeks pregnant. Chris did a test for me being the great guy he is. I can't believe it.. well I guess I can. We had both decided we wanted kids eventually, but I didn't know it'd happen so soon. I'm excited!!!!!!
