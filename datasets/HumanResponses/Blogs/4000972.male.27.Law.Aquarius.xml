       the poem i just recited in the previous entry is something i've always held close to my heart. through thick and thin, with it as my mantra, i have&nbsp;been able to rise above life's difficulties. i credit that little piece of artistry w/ getting me this far, and hope that it helps all you during your tough times............

      Sorry no amusing posts or lovely photos of myself, got caught up in pretending that I actually had a real legal job with a law firm, and before I had realized it I had pretended the day away. And again, as always I am thoroughly intoxicated, and I think I may have peed in my pants. Update to follow.

       &nbsp;Just a little tribute to the man who to many of us was our shining light, our north star, our beacon in the dark&nbsp;through this hellish experience known as law school, Professor White, you shall be missed!&nbsp;

       &nbsp; This is the last post today I promise, can't seem to find much motivation to do anything else though, b/c again, as is often the case, I've wasted the entire day in a drunken blur. Not much to do when you're unemployed, but it could be worse. Anyways this picture is nearly a decade old, 17 yrs old at the time, now look at me, I'm a total chick magnet-soon to be lawyer. Good friends we shall be, till next time......

      Now I understand, the last one may have been a bit too much, but unless someone&nbsp;really puts themself out there, can you ever truly know them? Now you know my style, and hopefully you understand where I'm comin' from, and in the up coming days and weeks, countin down to our&nbsp;return to&nbsp;C-M, you'll be hearin and learnin a lot more......

       &nbsp;To break the ice I figured I might introduce myself w/ a photo or 2, my name is Ricky, and a I am a 3L at C-M. That handsome devil in the upper-right hand corner, also me, but taken a few years&nbsp;back when I was carrying a bit more weight.&nbsp;Yeah, that's me alright, kickin' it down it Edgewater Park with the Hennesey, tryin to keep myself rom throwin' up. Good days, but don't worry, there'll be many more to come.&nbsp;
