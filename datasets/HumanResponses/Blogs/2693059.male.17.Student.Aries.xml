       song  Devin the Dude - Right now   bored..ate a big ass breakfast today then went to funcoland to return the broken controller i bought for a new one. Then i sold 2 games to them and bought  Freedom Fighters  and  Manhunt . Freedom fighters is good and if ne1 wants manhunt ill trade them for a diff game. Then after that went searching for dressers at all those cheap furniture stores in downtown hayward, didn't find anything but expensive cheap furniture i would rather buy good shit for the same price. Yea now im sitting in my room online listenin to some Devin the Dude. Nothing else todo...so how are u doing? Oh your silent, i understand. FUCK YOU THEN BITCH. Yea so ima sit and just say some stuff cause theres nothing todo and im bored like i have already stated. Feelin soo wonderful. Did alot of calf raises today cause my knees don't hurt that much so i can start dunking easy again and by season, someone will get dunked on. Today while i was looking for furniture a  BIG  ass plane flew over my head, i swear if i wasn't next to the airport i would have been extremely frightened . Im just gonna list my goals for this schoolyear.      Get straight A's to raise my GPA     Dunk on someone           Get a Job     Windmill     Get accepted into a mediocre college  take the slang word   hella   out of my vocabulary because its stupid and i don't know how i got caught up in saying it                                                 -and the list goes on......

       song  Zapp and Roger - Computer Love    well my wish came true, i did kinda good.  We had 3 games yesterday we lost 2 and won 1.  In the game we won i had the game winning shot.  Fuckin lost to weak ass teams though.  I played pretty good in all of them.  Today we had 2 games we won both.  I did good today too.  Can't wait till season now, ima bout to lift hella weights and bulk up and practice even more now so i can kill in season.   Right now im tired as hell but thats ok since we dont have any basketball stuff in august.  Im just going to rest for a few days and do nothing till my body feels good again.  Then i will get to practicing .  I also only got 1 1/2 weeks left of summerschool can't wait.  Now i can put my wow card to use.  I paid 40 somethin bucks and i havent even used it yet sooo if u going to GA tell me.   Its amazing how doing good in a few basketball games can make you feel so much better.   gotta take a shower now so ima stop writing.

       Song  R.Kelly - Feelin on your booty    no motivation todo anything. i always fuck up on any goal i have. theres no point wasting my time in school anymore and failing classes and doing all this bullshit for what? Tobe dissapointed not get in a good college then goto chabot then just say fuck everything get some weak ass job and become a bum and beg for money in SF. All im doing is prolonging my future. I might as well start now instead of later. Im so damn tired of trying and just being defeated in every damn thing i do. Nothing goes right for me. I don't understand why not, i lose in everything, i wanna know what success feels like. Or accomplishing something. how can i fuck up at everything in my life its just not right.  im so tired of being kicked and kicked while ive already been down.

       im finally bak from that trip, i thought it would be great but no.  El Dorados buffet was good though.  We went like 4-1 or something in the tournament.  Got no sleep or ne rest.   Nothing on tv either.  I had the most juice ive ever had in my life while in Reno.  I remember getting like a sobe and arizona tea twice a day and downing them in like 10 seconds cause i was always hella thirsty.  Today just did summer school again was a little late cause i really didn't feel like riding my bike there.  I broke my record of 20 mins riding my bike home, i did it in 13 mins, tommorow ima try for 10.  Doing pretty bad in basketball right now i dunno wtf is up with me, i have 0 energy and all i wanna do is sleep all day.  This summer was supposed to be my worry free, great and fun summer but its my worst and i can't wait till next summer when i can be fillin out papers and stuff for college then finally leave.

       hmm i don't know what to say... i just sat here and wrote like 9823 things then erased it.  fuckin tired did the usual summerschool then game shit.  Reno trip comes up Friday and if i dont get my mind right ima fuck up some more there.  Im starting to notice how all the badass undeserving people who lie and do all this bullshit get everything they want.  And all the good people don't get shit.  I hardly know ne good people with good lives and if you know alot  then hahaha they probably aren't and your just a blind dumbass.  Good people don't get second chances the bad ones do.  So i suggest we all become sleezy ass losers...that is the true path to becoming successful.

       soooo fuckin tired..... woke up at 5:00 then went to doctors appointment at 7:30 for my knees only to be given more exercises and medicine.  After that i went to summerschool till 12:35, then rode my bike from there as fast as i could to get to tennyson before 1 to get a ride.  After that went to game in pleasanton we won both of them.  I was tired as hell before i even started playing.  Then got back at about 5:30 only to have a nice little 30 min rest then on to doing the scoreboard from 6 to fucking 10.  I have gotten a combined 10 hours of sleep probably in this last week.  I got no more energy for tommorows game at 11 AM.  Just gonna go and do the best i can.  World is also getting worse everyday.  Everything around me is getting worse. Life has gone from terrible to fuckin  i dunno but life is just fucked up.

       I don't care what you think.  Im not a professional critiquer       -Chronicles of Riddick - this movie was terrible.  Plot was retarded actors retarded everything.  Tell me how they go on a planet that is 700 degrees hot in the day time and the go out and simply hide in the shade so they won't get burnt.  Since when does shade protect you from 700 degree weather?     -White Chicks - a few funny parts but most of it was just weird.  Everything kind of just fell apart at the end.  Somehow this movie reminded me of Ms. Congeniality.     -Spiderman 2 - bullshit most of you will like this cause your idiots.  Retarded ass drama everything, Kirsten Dunst is hideous i dont wanna have to look at her for 2 hours.  Just a 2 hour soap opera.

       song The roots - stay cool  fuckin wasted my fucking money again.  I bought a ps2 network adapter thinking i could hook it up to my ethernet card and use the internet connection from my wireless network(maybe i still can if i use windows xp as a router but that is way way way waaaay too much trouble and im lazy) but noooo.  So noooooow i gotta buy a wireless ethernet bridge so i can play my ps2 games online using my wireless network.....  The wireless bridge is like 80 bucks.....even on ebay.  I could have fuckin bought a wireless network adapter for my ps2 for 70 something by itself and now ima end up paying like 130 cause i always make the wrong decisions about everything.  The worst thing is i knew there was a chance of it not working but i went ahead and bought it anyway.  Oh well, since i always fuck up on everything eventually something great is going to happen to me and everyone will be jealous of me.  Ima fuckin win 1 billion dollars or be the 1st man on mars or somethin, its going to be great.   Tommorow im going to Great America and im finally going to put my WoW! card to use and no you cant come cause you will fuck everything up and bitch about where to eat and how you dont wanna go on any rides and sit to the side making everyone feel sorry for you, i hate when people do shit like that, just dont go.  Ima go and ride every single ride and go on the skyflyer as much as i want.  Im done

       song same one....    Yea im feeling good right now. My favorite boxer mike tyson lost because he tore his knee ligament in the 1st round. He still managed to win 3 of the 1st round but by the 4th it was difficult for him to throw punches. I knew there was no way Williams could beat him even though he has over 30 pounds of muscle on Tyson. If Tyson didn't tear his ligament Williams would have been knocked out in the 2nd round. I just hope Tyson can heal up. Now i feel like playing some Mike Tyson punchout for nintendo. Freedom Fighters is continuing to get funner and Manhunt is continuing to piss me off so if ne1 was to trade me a game for Manhunt tell me.  Im tired of people telling me they wanna see that weak ass catwoman movie too.  That shit is going to get the worst reviews ever.  People expect it to be like spiderman and daredevil and all that shit and follow the comic but noooo...  They completely remade costume,  that is the ugliest costume ive ever seen.  What the hell were they thinking.  She looks like a biker chick or somethin.  That costume in no way resembles a cat except for the mask.  Why didn't they just use the costume from Batman Forever or one like it.  They also changed the whole story, that should be illegal.  They basically took the name and idea of a woman who has Catlike attributes and fights crime and made it into shit.   Im not going to see the movie for the simple fact that the costume is retarded.  Also the funniest movie ever is Anchorman.  They should have done a better job advertising and it should have had a different name.  The good thing about that movie is that they don't show all their funny parts in the previews.  That movie is one of the funniest i have ever seen in my whole life.  The first 20 minutes of it i was regretting i bought the ticket for it.  But after the retarded jokes and dull parts the movie made a 360.  I believe this was done intentionally, but it could have backfired because i was about to leave the theater and get a refund.  You have togo see that movie over anything else.  Its better than everything in the theaters right now.  I wanna see that shit again.  Yup ima play some Live now.
