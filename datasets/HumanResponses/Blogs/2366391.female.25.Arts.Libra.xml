      There is nothing more lonely than crossing the Manhattan Bridge in a taxi late at night.  And if the window is open, and the cold air is rushing by, it's all I can do not to point my mouth toward the Manhattan skyline and scream in the direction of all those millions of twinkling lights.  The exact same view, five or six hours into the future, will make my morning as I zip, saturated by caffeine and that just-warm-from-bed feeling, towards my day.  But at night the city glares at me from behind, a socialite whose party I have ruined.    I truly believe going out in Mahattan is the modern day equivalent of the quest for The Holy Grail.  Saturday night rolls around, and it seems sparkling and somehow--you are sure--  different   than it has been before.  This will be the night.  For what?  Who knows.  But it will be big.  There is something in the air seductive enough to lure you away from your couch and your bed.  Forgetting how you limped home just seven days before, you reach into the closet and grab the stilletto pumps that elongate the leg and mangle the foot.  Squeeze into the leather pants that leave red marks on your stomach rolls.   Smack on the lipgloss.  And out the door.    Women in Manhattan are insane to go through this ritual.  Anyone who has had to tiptoe awkwardly across subway gratings, afraid that the tiny point of her high heel will slip through the gridding and cause her to fall on her face, knows exactly what I'm talking about.  And we have all done it, understanding instantly when we see a group of girls in a row, following each other like goslings, that they have encountered a particularly precarious stretch of sidewalk.  We glance down at our feet apprehensively and begin to stretch our calves.    "So.  Where should we go?" I ask, as we totter along, "What do you think about Spa?"  "You mean Plaid?"  "Spa is Plaid now?"  "Hello.  Yah."   "Oh.  Plaid, then."   "Too Jersey."   "Limelight?"   "Just reopened as Avalon.  But it's already over."   "Already?"   "Yep."    "Oh.  Heaven?"     "Boring."   "Hell?"   "Too tame.  Ohm?"   "What?"   "Ohm."   "Is a bar?"   "Yeah.  It's kind of a cross between K, 1020 and B61."   "Bingo."   "Sounds lame.  Where is it?"    "No.  I was kidding.  It sounded like...never mind."    "Be serious.  At this point, I think we should go with either Envy, Poison, Chaos or Rehab."    "Fun.  But why don't we just get really crazy and go to Ebola or Certain Doom?"    "Did those just open?"    "No.  Again.  Kidding."     "Oh."     "Don't tell me.  Oh must be near K?"     "No.  I just meant, oh."     "Right.  Duh."    "Oh mi gosh! Perfect!  I can't believe we didn't think of it before."   "Wait. What?"    "No, Duh. Totally Duh."     "Is a place?  You aren't serious."   At this point my calf muscles give out from seven blocks of tiptoeing and I fall in front of a bus and am killed instantly.  Years later, my friend opens a club in my memory called Freak Accident which quickly becomes   the    place in Manhattan to go for a night of fun and dancing, especially on Tuesday, which, by then, as everyone who's anyone knows, has become the new Friday.

      The last day of 2003.  I think we should make some lists.   Things I Should Give Up In 2004, But Probably Won't   1. Coca-Cola 2. Coffee 3. Rubbish TV (Examples: "Rich Girls," "The OC," etc.) 4. Mentioning M in my Blog    Things I May Actually Give Up In 2004   1. Keeping tissues in my pocket or purse (even if they're used and gross) just so I'll always have one. 2. Sex.  I only say this because I've had sex exactly two times in the last 365 days, so I guess I really might as well just go cold turkey in 2004.  Believe me,  urlLink I find this more depressing than you do . 3. Exercise.  Well, what a year.  Though, unfortunately much of it involved recuperating from The M Fiasco, it was also a year of several important triumphs.  And, although I am not one to brag, I figure that there is no better forum for celebrating my personal accomplishments than a blog that no one but me reads.    So, in 2003 I was one of five women accepted to one of the top five MFA Acting programs in the country.  In 2003 I had enough insight to know that I didn't actually want to  go       to an MFA Acting program, but just wanted to get into one.  My tenacity in 2003 got me an agent.  A good agent.  An agent who I'd have coffee with and who says things about me and my performing that are so good it's hard to believe they're true.  2003 brought me my first non-self-induced orgasm.   Thank you to those involved.  You know who you are.  2003.  Smack in the middle of my twenties.  Blonde.  One hell of a story-teller.  Great cheekbones.   Couple of good friends.  Couple of great ones.  Superior family; truly top-notch.  No life-threatening bad habits, and a few rather charming ones if I do say so myself.   Think it's gonna be a Happy New Year.  Knock wood.

      Cheating is a horrible thing.  And, lest there be any doubt about the kind of cheating I mean, let me clarify.  I do not mean the kind I did when we played that game Seven Up in fourth grade where you put your head down on your desk and one of the seven "it" people would come around and tap you on your shoulder and you had to then pick out which of the seven "it" people it was who had tapped you and I always knew because I   cheated        and looked at their shoes.  No.  I do not mean that kind of cheating.  I mean the kind of cheating where you find out that someone you love is fucking someone else.  There.  That seems clear.  M was, to my knowledge, the first guy to ever cheat on me.  I now qualify that statement with "to my knowledge" because The M Fiasco taught me in no uncertain terms that you never ever ever ever never know what goes on when you're not around.  Unless you have high-tech video surveillance in your apartment building like in the movie  urlLink Sliver .  And even then, you'd have to have high-tech video surveillance installed in every hotel room in Manhattan, and, as I discovered, Washington DC.  Which is expensive and a pain in the neck to maintain.  So.  Anyway, I'm off my point.  I dated M for eleven months and I had actually already officially broken up with him by the time I found out about The Unholy Slut-Whore from Hell.  I broke it off, I suppose, because on some molecular level I did know about The USWFH and possibly always knew.  Molecules, however, have very small pee-wee voices that only dogs and bees can hear and they are easily drowned out by the mighty, booming voice of Self-Delusion.  Which, in case you're wondering, sounds like those cars that drive up and down your street on Saturday nights at four am with the bass turned up so high that your windows rattle.  Meaning, I guess, that Self-Delusion sounds like really loud 50 Cent.  But anyway...  Though we had officially broken up when The USWFH reared her unholy slut-whore head, we were also officially trying to be friends and seeing each other regularly and doing pretty much everything we'd done when we were officially dating.  So officially this time was painful and difficult, but in an unofficial, delicious kind of way.  Very  urlLink teenage-angsty stuff .   My molecular knowledge turned to actual knowledge on the morning after the NYC Blackout when I was staying at M's apartment and snooped in his computer.  The power in his apartment came back and, sitting at his desk about to search the internet for the answer to the looming question, "How the hell did the power in New York City actually go entirely -out-?", my eyes immediately traveled to the file titled (go figure) "My Journal".  Hmm...  Should I?  Why not.  Open file.  Read file.  Die a thousand deaths.  For any of you moral wombats out there preaching that I shouldn't have violated his privacy, first of all, Eat Me.  Second of all, don't you worry.  I got mine.  There was only one entry written during the weekend we had officially broken up.  Weirdly, he had already told me a version of everything in it.  The conversations he recounted with his brother in the first paragraph were no suprise.  He'd told me them almost verbatum.  Description of his frazzled state of mind post-breakup.  No surprise.  I even remembered witnessing the tears.  Mention of a certain athletic, skinny Asian woman from work who he'd had dessert with.  Surprise.  Mention of how he invited her back to his apartment.  Surprise.  Description of her saying something coy like, "If I come back to your place, I'll spend the night."  Surprise.  Account of her seeing my photo on his bookshelf and running out of the apartment.  Account of him acknowledging that he forgot to take down said photo (as had, apparently, been his routine) because he'd expected me to be over and hadn't expected her to stop by.  Account of him dashing down the hall after her to tell her that he thought she was "different" (?) and that he was willing to "try the relationship on her terms" (?).  Surprise.  Surprise.  Surprise.  Amazingly at this point, the bellowing voice of Self-Delusion was still frantically singing away, pulling out all the stops and belting out every Broadway tune it could remember.  We're talking  urlLink full production numbers  here, all in a last stitch effort to drown out the obvious truth.    But then.    He described how they went to bed.    To our bed.   I had a side.  He described how  urlLink her body was beautiful.   How it was a pleasure to lay next to her.  He talked about waking up in the middle of the night when his doorbell mysteriously rang.  How he thought it might be me.  Worried it might be me and told her so.  How she recommended he call me.  How he got out of bed to check if I'd called, and when he came back how she said,     "When we had sex in Washington D.C. did you come inside of me?"    Like I said.  I got mine.    I remember feeling like my bones were trying to absorb me.  Sitting in that chair, in that apartment drawing myself into myself so as not touch anything around me.  Wishing to be small.  Wishing to be nothing.  So that I wouldn't have to deal with every polluted surface around me.  Places where I had sat and lain and kissed him.  Things that I had touched and read.  And God the stupid, childish gifts that I had given.  A ceramic pot that I had painted for him for Halloween so that he would have somewhere to keep his millions of pens.  The wooden bird my father had carved and sent to him for Christmas.  My foolish, foolish photo standing on his bookshelf, in a frame decorated with pages from _Twelfth Night_, the play we'd seen on our first date.  These things offended me most because they showed how thoroughly I'd been invested ("invested" meaning "fooled").  I mean I made him crafty things to decorate his apartment.  And I wasn't even embarrassed about this.  I even told people about my Martha Stewart endeavors who, in response, pretended to be happy that I was  urlLink so in love that I was making crafts.   Sentimental pots with pumpkins on them and a homemade picture frame.  Things that, let's face it, were meant to be cute reminders of me around his apartment, signifying our history and our feelings.    But, from that chair, in front of those words and my grinning fool's face, I remember doubling over from the force of the transformation.  The uncovering of the most horrible kind of movie set magic--coming up against the wires and tricks and manipulations.  Recognizing the truth of the gifts I had given.  Seeing them as he saw them: as props.  I wondered where he put them when she came over.    When I could breathe and see again I started writing him....              a very scathing letter.    I know.    I wanted to burn shit up--I mean actually physically set things on fire.  And it would have been very satisfying in a Bertha Mason sort of way, to be able to stand atop the crumbling roof of his apartment building as it collapsed in on itself and I cackled in crazy fury with flames licking at my feet.  To see his face twist when he realized that his vast collection of priceless books on war, politics and the economy was gone forever.  But I figured my vengeance would be short-lived and would quickly lose its satisfying tang as soon as I plunged eight stories to my fiery doom.  I mean I know they do say vengeance is sweet, but "they" also used to sit around trying to kill two birds with one stone and figuring out how many ways there are to skin cats, so....  I also wanted him never to be happy again.  Seriously.  I still kind of want that.  I want him to go through his next seventy or so years on this planet and never feel good about himself, never feel excited.  And at the time I wanted to find a means to ensure his eternal unhappiness.  Burning shit up being out of the question, I figured writing a very     very         scathing and mean, nasty letter would just about do it.  So I wrote one and unfortunately didn't save it and when he came home that night he closed the window and deleted it before he even finished reading it.  Yep.    The moral of this story, then, would seem to be: urlLink next time, burn shit up.

      OK, I have a dilemma.  It's another one regarding M and new (well, new-ish) technology.    I'm about to close my AOL account because it's useless and because my roommate and I, feeling rich several months ago, bought Road Runner.  I used to use it as my internet provider, and when I no longer needed it for that purpose, I used it to....  Well.    Ahem.    I, um--FUCK.    Fine.    I used it to see when M was logged in to AOL Instant Messenger.  Man, the truth is  urlLink ugly .  It's just that (you know whatever's coming next is gonna be pathetic) it made me feel better to know when he was online.  God, can you even believe I wrote that?  It's good no one reads this.  I suppose that it didn't actually mean that he was online.  It mostly meant that he just forgot to turn off his computer or log out at the end of his work day.  Means--I should speak in present tense.  Because, though my account will be terminated shortly, it is not yet terminated, and I did just (as in five seconds ago) double click on his name (which is the only name on my buddy list--the only name on any of my lists, actually, because he is the only reason why I even have an IM account) and do what I always do which is sit there and stare at the blank message box that comes up, begging me with its sweet, siren song to send him a message:    Please, send him a little note.  Just a short one.  Just a "How are you?" that would pop up in the middle of his workday and surprise him.  You know you want to.  It would make you sooo happy.  Would make him sooo happy.  It'll make him love you.  His love is just one click away.  It's so easy.  Just one teeny-weeny click.    It's like crack.  No.  That's inaccurate.  You know what it's exactly like?  It's exactly like when you're missing a tooth and you can't keep your tongue away from the tooth-missing-crater in your mouth.  So your tongue keeps going back to the crater and feeling around, and feeling it out to see if anything's changed since the last time four milliseconds ago when it was in that   same    hole feeling around.  And of course nothing has changed, but your tongue just keeps digging in there anyway because its fascinating for some unknown reason, that gummy hole where your tooth used to be.    It's exactly like that.  The sight of M's name on my buddy list, particularly when my buddy list tells me that he's logged in and clearly waiting at his desk on Wall Street just for me to IM him, is my very own gummy crater hole.  And I am a huge, pathetic, slimy, probing, masochistic fucking  urlLink tongue .  Wow.

      I am serious about this.  Count it as yet another of the universe's cruel jokes.   We've been given the ability to endlessly produce one thing with absolutely no effort, and that thing turns out to be utterly disgusting and totally useless.    Cruel world.  I shouldn't complain overly much, however.  Because of what will go down in history as  urlLink The Christmas Flu Miracle , I did not have to sing a Celine Dion duet with my high school boyfriend at my high school best friend's wedding in Wisconsin.    My Christmas Flu Miracle did   not   save me from having the following conversation with my high school boyfriend (who is a pompous ass and an opera singer) at the wedding reception:  Me: Hey.  HSBF: So how did I sound?  Me: At the wedding?     ( ..at the wedding that happened four hours ago? )  HSBF: Of course.  Me: Umm.  Great.  Introduce me to your date.  HSBF:  This is Melissa.  So the balance was fine?  Me:  Yeah.  Sounded great.  So, Melissa, what do you do?  HSBF (scanning my face to gauge my reaction): She lives in France with her mom.    Me (not very impressed): Wow.  HSBF: I'm glad to hear the balance was fine.    Me: Yeah.  It was.  The whole thing was just really, really well-balanced.  HSBF:  Good.  'Cause, you know I really had to hold back.  Stood as far as possible from the mike.  Tried to reign myself in--the voice is getting so big, and powerful and all.  Wasn't easy.  Me: That's.  Wow.  That's great.  If you two will excuse me, I have to run blow my nose.  Don't worry, I coughed on him several times.

      Ah, the bleary-eyed, muddy feeling of a righteous hangover.  Didn't even have the strength to put in my contacts this morning.  Ah, Karaoke.  Ah, Quervo Gold.  Ah, Youth.  Observations from the party last night:  Sometimes, when I'm feeling particularly awkward in conversations (like, when, for example, my friend is introducing me to a guy who writes and directs music videos for Britney Spears) I don't know what to do with my hands.    Why is it never that the man who writes and directs music videos for Ms. Spears wants to include me in his next project, but   instead    that the strange man with a large gap in his teeth and suspiciously unkempt hair wants to keep in touch with me because (in a breathy voice, with eyes large and spooky like a jack-o-lantern) he thinks I'm adorable and wants to know how he can get me involved in his work?  When feet are tired and clamped up in very high-heeled boots, they throb on the bottoms in time with your heartbeat.   Sometimes the older, glamorously dressed woman who has a slightly mysterious Southern accent and is keeping the attention of the man whose attention you wish    you    were keeping, turns out, in the end, to be his stepmother.   It is never a good feeling to have a married person hit on you.  Energy can shoot through you like a sneeze the minute they play Petula Clark's "Downtown."  Even at 3:30 am.

      I would like to complain about text messages.  More accurately I would like to complain about my exboyfriend, M, who--because of existing text message technology--managed to hurl a "Thinking about you"  message at me last night at (let me check my phone) exactly 1:09 am.    Email is bad enough.  While going through the trouble of turning on a computer, logging into an email account, crafting a message, addressing it properly and clicking the "Send" option is (one would think) enough to make certain that no one who is too drunk or too emotional  (or both) could ever complete the task without thinking better of it and returning to bed to either throw up or cry (or both), we all know that those emails do sometimes get sent.  We'll give it, however, a sending percentage of around 33%.  Meaning that two out of three drunken, emotionally misguided computer users usually just never even turn their laptops on.    Text message, however, has changed this.  The sending percentage for the average user when dealing with text messages: we'll put it at around 80%.  Admittedly, average users are going to send text messages saying things like, " U R cute. :) "  or " I'm out front.  U ? "  As we all know, there is no need to contemplate the meaning or repercussions of any message that either uses the letter "u" rather than the word, or is punctuated by a winky smiley face of any sort (this is just one of the basic common sense tenets of being a human being who lives in the world.  If you need further clarification, stop reading this and go set yourself on fire).  For these average users, then, text-messaging is a harmless mode of meaningless communication--the white noise, if you will, of the conversation family.    For M, though, the text message is an emotionally safe window of communication-opportunity unparalleled since the days of the smoke signal.  Picture this.  You are M.  You're a successful (read: millionaire at thirty) banker.  You are more intelligent, academically, than 99.9% of the population at large.  You are less intelligent, emotionally, than 99.9% of most...well, than most everything.  Because I am the bigger person here and, though the bastard cheated on me with a skinny, athletic Asian woman who makes upwards of $800,000 dollars a year and has a fiance in London...fuck it.  He deserves every bit of venom I can muster.  Bed bugs and sea anemones are more emotionally evolved than M.  They may also be better gift givers and keep cleaner apartments.  So, you are M and it is one in the morning and you are returning from a long evening of drinking with other emotionally stunted banker types.  You have just eaten a large steak, imbibed copious amounts of alcohol, and possibly gone to a strip club.  All in the name of doing business for a large foreign bank.  You're terribly frightened of commitment.  You have cheated on and broken the heart of a girl who you recognize would have loved you "whether [you] were a banker or a teacher or nothing at all."  You're Catholic and at this point your meaningless guilt is so heavy that your taxi is actually riding low.  And there in the palm of your hand is the means to your salvation.  Safe (which is key, key, key to the M Rules for Self-Expression).  Convenient (which appeals to your bleary eyes and alcohol-tainted dexterity).  And Easy.  All these things considered, if you are M the likelihood that a text message will be written and sent?  It is what the French call, A Sure Thing.  So we all know what happened next.  M, feeling drunk and sentimental, picked up the phone and--reaching deep into his heart for meaningful sentiment--recalled the last Hallmark card he'd seen on his grandmother's card table and typed the three little words every ex-girlfriend wants to see on her phone screen at one a.m.    Bless his heart, he didn't even write, "Thinking of u."      As a form of communication in general, these are the things that bother me about texting.  The thumb-typing allows you to be involved in other activities while sending messages.  Theoretically, you could, say, hold a cell phone and--I don't know--get a blow job in the back of a taxi from--let's use our imaginations here--maybe...mmm...A ha!  From a skinny, athletic Asian woman (or five) while simultaneously typing a "Thinking of you" message to your lovelorn ex-girlfriend.  Also, as a form of communication in general, the text message is, en Francais, Half-Assed.  It's impersonal, takes less than thirty seconds to write and send.  It's origins are dubious (see above).  Cell phone screens are too small to contain large sentiments or thoughtfully chosen big words.  There's no art to a text message.  It's not even an expensive cliche like flowers or jewelry.  Less risky than a phone call.  In other words, its exactly what you send if you're a drunk, emotionally challenged commitment phobic banker who wants to say "Yo, Yo, Yo Dawg!  Awwwwyeah" to an ex.    For all of you men who may stumble upon this, and who don't have the benefit of a sister or female best friend to guide you through your pathetic and meaningless male lives, let me now illuminate the events that take place after the sending of such a selfish little missive.  First of all, a bit of backstory.  Though it pains me to point it out,  if you will cast your eyes up about ten inches you'll see the reference to bed bugs and sea anemones.    Pause.  Pause.  I know.  Weak.   All of you none readers out there are probably pissed at me and wondering when the real venom starts to flow.  Yeah.  So am I.  I went to an all-women's college where I spent four years espousing feminist beliefs.  Most of my friends own well thumbed copies of _Backlash_.  We're hardcore.  And, not to toot my own horn here, but I think one of the first adjectives my close friends would use to describe me would be...Strong.  Followed closely by Independent.  But, the truth is glaring and ugly like Michael Jackson in direct sunlight: my venom trickles rather than gushes, and it peters out after about a paragraph and a half.    With that in mind, I direct you to the above quote about loving M wether he was a banker, teacher, etc.  Well--and readers with weak stomachs should probably stop reading here--this is a quote from the email he sent me (which I have pretty much memorized) when I stopped speaking to him after finding out he had cheated on me.  And....  Well, fuck.  Fuck, fuck fuck, fuck fuck FUCK FUCK.  This quote accurately reflects my feelings for him.  Money, no money.  Whatever.  Could've cared less.  Odd and screwed up as he was...  Well.  You know.  Before I get back on point, I have to have a moment to defend my feelings for him and to try to explain why those feelings are so hard to get rid of.  He was an emotionally witholding cheating letch, and a liar. I now know that this is true.  But the thing that happens when someone lies to you is that they usually only cover up the bad stuff.    To me, the truth of our relationship was him rapping Sir Mix-A-Lot in the shower at six am while getting ready for work.  It was being in bed next to him and opening our eyes just long enough to kiss once before falling back to sleep.  Just like that.  Kissing as natural as breathing.  It's him saying, "Have fun storming the castle," as I rolled out of bed for the airport at four a.m..  During our relationship, he may have lied and withheld and lied and withheld some more.  But I just told the truth and fell in love with him.  And the result? Well, I suppose it would be like the museum guard sidling up to your favorite painting and unveiling its tacky, horrendous, day-glo colored other half.  You can't help it if you still see the thing you loved before.  Sure it's altered, but the GOOD half is still   there .  And if you just hold your hand up and stand at a distance, you can totally block out the horrible part.  Or if you close one eye and turn your head at just the right angle it's like the bad stuff never was even revealed.  And though the good half wasn't perfect, it was...well, it was your favorite.    (For those of you already sick of this metaphor, skip two paragraphs down.  You'll miss little, trust me.)  But eventually you realize that you can't go around with your head bent at funny angles and one eye closed forever (and believe me at this point that you've  contemplated buying a patch or just going all the way and Oedipus-ing the one out with your fingernails.)  You realize there are other paintings in the museum, that there is little dignity in self-mutilation, that that line "Love means never having to say you're sorry" is total bunk, blah, blah, blah, kumbayah, Gloria Steinem, rah, rah, rah.  And, though I treat these realizations lightly now, coming to them in reality is mind-numbingly, bone crunchingly hard.  Crawling on broken glass hard.    But you do it.  And, though you're too depressed to be even the slightest bit happy about not gouging your eye out, you open 'em both.  And you walk away.  Then, in an effort to get over M, you embark on a mission to remake, reorder, and redo everything about yourself which includes, but is not limited to, the following:  (This gets ugly.  I'm warning you) Dusting. Whitening your teeth.  Getting monthly facials and a glycolic peel for a cost equal to the national debt of a small Third World Country. Joining an online dating site.   Going out on any number of dates with men from said site in an effort to convince yourself that there is hope of finding someone new. (There isn't).  SO THAT IS WHY IT SUCKS (wait 'till you see how I'm gonna bring this one FULL CIRCLE, back to the POINT--Barbara Taylor Bradford move over, it's just us Big Dawgs now, Awwwwyeah) to receive a "Thinking of you" text message at one in the morning.  Because receiving such a message means that, just when you were starting to put your life back together...  ...it turns to shit all over again.  So what will I do?  Will I respond?  As I sit here, blogging furiously, my newly whitened teeth glinting in the light of my computer screen, I already know the answer.    I would like to say I will respond with something cool and distant:  HIM: Thinking of you.  ME: Don't.    But, the trouble with that is that then he might not.  Think of me, I mean.  And then there's the other kind of message I'm dying to send.   I think of you, too.  I think of you and miss you and hate you and have things I want to ask you and things I want to scream at you.  And why?  And how could you?  And do you?  And did you ever?  And when?  What was it like?  Why her? And there is not room in the world for me to write out all things I think of as I sit here thinking of you.   Which I won't send him either.  So I'll just sit here.  Stalemate.  Just silently hating the useless fuck who invented the text message, and put me in the middle of this dilemma in the first place.

      Why do people not understand that the purpose of Christmas music is to inspire warmth and good cheer? Recording a version of "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas," then, featuring only tinny sounding electric keyboards and xylophones would seem to be a poor choice.  As would the entire idea of an American Idol Christmas Special.  I just came back to the office half an hour early from lunch simply because the Au bon Pain X-mas music selection was so grim.  All those pasty sounding voices stretching what used to be one word into what sounds like eight hundred a la Mariah Carey: "HaaaahHHvvee  YooooOOOOOOoorseeeeehehehehehlf  AaaaAh  Meeeeeeeheehereeeeeeeeee..."  You get the idea.  Nothing can be soft or pretty.  Certainly nothing can be sincere.  Everything is long acryilic fingernails flashing in the air and hip-hop versions of "Oh Come All Ye Faithful" performed by P. Diddy and the entire cast of   Survivor Thailand .   So.

      The woman who gives me bikini waxes is trying to lead me into a seedy life of petty crime.  Her name is Bella.  She comes from The Old Country, where women look like men and family pets get eaten when times are hard.  Our relationship is very complicated.  It used to be that I would just lay back on her crinkly, paper-covered table.  She would then smile her gap-toothed grin at me and say, Slavik-ly, "Tek ov yooerr oondahvar."  Having no idea what she had just said, with my upper lip already sweating in anticipation of the pain, I would typically reply with something like, "I know.  I wish it would stop raining."  Since Bella already thinks I am a sex-hungry American girl with a thing for pain and an odd distaste for body-hair, it was pretty much fine with me if she also thought I was stupid.  Besides, you don't know "awkward" until you've tried to make small talk while a Russian woman with a moustache looms over you and covers your genitals with hot wax.     Generally, then, our total inability to communicate suited me just fine.    Lately, however, Bella has had a hankering to reach out across the great international divide and establish better relations between our two nations.  It is possible--communications from The Old Country being what they are--that she learned only recently that the Cold War had ended.  In any case, in her special way, she has decided to send out an olive branch.  So now, we have the following conversation  each time  I see her.  "Yooo haf beoyfrent?"    "What?  Oh.  No, no I don't have a boyfriend."  She is persistent.  "No mehn?"  I can only assume she hopes that I am putting myself through this hot-wax skin-ripping torture because there is a large, gold-chain-wearing man somewhere who will only wife me if I have the vagina of a ten year-old girl.    I imagine that if I replied--after struggling for some few minutes to understand what the hell she had just said, "Yes, Bella, I do have a boyfriend"--she would be just tickled pink.  (I have to interrupt myself here to say that I am laughing my ass off at the thought of Bella being tickled pink.  If you knew Bella you would understand this.  Bella has never been tickled.  Ever.  Tickling Bella pink would be like tickling Mikhail Gorbachev pink.  It would be a fucking laugh riot.)    Anyway, if Bella was familiar with the expression, "newfangled"  I'm sure she would apply it to my relationship with this imagined beefy boyfriend.  As long as he put bread on the table and washed his hands after milking the goats, vat vood eet mahter zsat he laik hees vomen to bee laik leetle gurl?  Indeed, Bella.  What would it matter.  However, since whenever Bella inquires after the current state of my lovelife, I respond, "Nope.  No boyfriend,"  she is utterly perplexed.  "Ow auld, you?" she will ask me next.  "Huh?"  I will say, wincing in anticipation of the pain.    RIP.  "Ow -auld- you?"  RIP. rip.  "Ohhh," I bite back a scream, "Same age as last month, Bella.  Twenty-five."   "Put hant heeyer.   Pooel skeen."    I comply.  RIP.  "Yooer husbant, he die?  He leef yoo vit behbie?"  RIP.  rip. rip. rip.  "Ahhh.  Wooh.  That was a doozy.  Um, no, never married, Bella."  This answer displeases her.  "Ald oon von meynute," she'll say.  Then--though I am presently laying on a table in a flourescently-lit room with my knees by my ears and my legs spread  akimbo --she will open the door W I D E (and by "wide" I mean, ALL THE WAY) and step out.  I will raise my head and smile dimly at the faces of the people in the hallway who have just seen my bare ass.  For a brief moment I will be thankful for the searing pain in my loins that has sent my brain into shock and dulled the humiliation I would otherwise surely feel.   Bella usually comes back a second later carrying something innocuous like towels.  This act doesn't fool me for a second; we both know that she's just taken a few nips at the old wodka bottle.  My singlehood drives Bella to drink.  It is somewhere around this time that Bella decides that I am probably a hooker.    I don't blame her.  My dutiful waxing is insane.  Even more insane, in fact, than Bella even realizes.  For, while  she thinks  that I wax my nether-regions because I am the recipient of a lot of manly love-action,  I know  that tearing the hairs out of the most sensitive region of my body with continuous, violent, ripping motions, is really more of a wishful-thinking kind of ritual for me.  I am sometimes even tempted to explain to Bella my true reason for undergoing this tortuous hair-removal process.  I am, after all, not without some small knowledge of the Russian language.  In my opera days I sang some doleful Rachmoninoff arias and, were I to dig through my memory hard enough, I am sure I could recall the Russian words for "deep yearning for a man."  In my fantasy, I reveal my pain and loneliness to Bella in perfect Russian, and she sobs, gives me the waxing for free and then we go out for a night on the town with her red-faced husband Vlad.    However, it is far more likely that I would just fuck up my pronunciation or my translation and end up accidentally hitting on Bella, which--given the, erm, circumstances (Naked.  Akimbo.)--would be easily the most awkard situation to happen since, well, ever.  Not exactly a fool-proof plan.    So, having decided that I am possibly a prostitute and definitely a twisted mother-fucker who gets off on genital mutilation (Being from The Old Country, Bella is not afraid to judge.) Bella decides to pull out all the stops and make herself an extra buck or two.  Bella closes the door behind her.  The mood in the room changes perceptibly.  I am afraid that Bella is about to try to sell me crack.  She bends down to my ear and whispers conspiratorially, "Yoo vant stoomache wayx?"  Pause.    "Cohst extrah. Yoo peh Beylla."  I am bewildered.  First of all, why all the whispering?  Second of all, do I actually have hair on my stomach?  Eeew.  I raise my head to see.  She interprets this as a nod.  "Owkeh," she mouths, pointing at the door and the ceiling.    I begin to panic.  What?  Is the room bugged?  Are we being--oh God.  Is this  on tape ?  Am I on a grainy video being broadcast throughout the former Soviet Union with my legs spread wide open for any fat man with a million rubles to see?    I am, apparently, entering The Bikini-Waxing Black Market.  I wonder briefly if Bella will ask me to follow her into a back alley where she will try to sell me counterfeit Nair.  Bella, apparently, has done this before.    She continues in an even softer voice, "Beylla vill ehsk, 'Yoo vant wayx stoomache?'  Yoo seh, 'No Beylla.'"     This last is accompanied by a series of shh-gestures and pointing towards the ceiling, the door, me, her, my stomach, etc.    I am truly terrified now.  As I follow Bella's pointing finger, it is becoming obvious that there must be cameras everywhere.  The Soviet Eye of The Bikini-Waxing Black Market is all over this room.  Possibly even in my belly-button.    "Yoo vant wayx stoomache?" Bella asks in an artificially loud voice, which she projects toward the air vent in the corner.    The plan, I guess, is in motion.  I imagine KGB officers sitting just behind what I realize now must be a two-way mirror.    "No, Bella!" I say.  My voice is overly bright and forced.  It is not my best work.  I'm nervous.  "Goood gehrl," mouths Bella.  She then proceeds to wax my stomach, all the while winking at me and saying softly, "Cohst extrah.  Yoo peh Beylla."  When my (I guess totally hair-covered?) stomach is finished, Bella bends in again.  "Peh joost Beylla.  Beylla du laig?  Du thighe?" she offers.  What am I, a Yeti?  I begin to sit up.    "No, Bella--"   She makes frantic shh-gestures with her finger.  "no, bella," I lower my voice.  "i am not that hairy.  i can just shave my legs.  i feel kind of bad about this.  i'll just pay the salon.  it's no big deal.  thank you, though."  "Beylla du laig.  Vill be moore behyuutivul.  Yoo no see hayer.  Foor yoo onlee leetle beet extrah," she mouths, beginning to adjust my leg and giving the back of my thigh a meaningful look.  I am not that hairy.  I will not let her make me feel insecure.  I will not believe that on the back of my thighs there is some sort of gorrilla-fur that I have conveniently blocked out through a strange and rare psychological combination of denial and astigmatism, but which Bella's eyes alone can see....      "No, Bella.  I don't want it.  I will do it myself.  Thank you," I force my leg back from her grasp.    "Beylla du laig."  Another meaningful glance at my leg.  She reaches for my thigh.  Hmm.  Invisible gorrila-fur.  Stranger things have happened.  I waiver.    She senses that victory is near.    But then, I remember that I only have a twenty.  I rebound.  "No!  No, Bella!  You! Will! Not! Win!"  She reaches for a body part with wax dripping from her terrible popsicle-stick waxing tool.  I dodge and twist, praying that I leave this room with both my eyebrows.  It becomes a veritable wrestling match.  I imagine somewhere in the ceiling the cameras are on "Record" now, with the KGB officers hidden in back already printing out labels that read, "Putin's Pootang vs. America's Favorite Bush."    In the end, however, her meaningful glances are no match for my poverty.  I roll off the table and grab for my oondahvar.    "Maybe next time, Bella.  Thanks a lot, though."    I pay her a few dollars extra for my black-market stomach wax.  I feel dirty.    But that will end soon enough.    I'm seeing her again next week Thursday and will be sure to bring along extra cash so she can take care of every last bit of the invisible gorrilla-fur.    Hey, during a sexual dry-spell a girl can't afford to take any chances.  I mean, come on.

      One of the (ten-thousand-million-gazillion) good things about SNOW DAYS is that they allow you to go through all of your old diary entries and remember the bliss that is...  CLOSURE:  (Brief backstory: D was The Boyfriend Before M.  I was: fresh out of college and just coming off of six months of touring with a show.  He was: 30, a hot-shot in the classical music industry, and prone to going on two-week long bed and breakfast vacations with his mother.  Who he referred to as his "soulmate."  His father was still married to his mother, but was not invited on these trips.  Which made two of us.)  ***  August 6, 2002  It happened today.  I took back the last pieces of my wardrobe.  Less than one year later, and our entire relationship is pared down to fifteen awkward minutes in your apartment and one black Betsey Johnson dress.  When I asked if you were home, your doorman said, "They usually come in at night."  I jumped quickly to correct him, "He's single, so it wouldn't be 'they.'"    I was wrong, as the picture in front of your desk (in direct sightline so that you can see her at any moment during your day.  You must be so in love.) clearly told me.  Her name is Erin, and she's gorgeous.    But, so am I.  I'm going to stop this now, because it's taking me in the wrong direction.  The picture of your new girlfriend did not make me sad.  You've moved on; I've moved on.  And I guess I know a little about the shape of your love.  I know that your mom still--always--comes first.  That your dog, your friends, your job, are all priorities.  That your words are always sweet and poignant, but, when it comes down to the moment when you're truly needed--the moment when my frightened phone call interrupts your meeting--all of your sweet words will become just so much noise.  I cried today not because I want to be back in your life, though admittedly, in that apartment, part of me admired the illusion of your new self.  Your two new buzz words are "casual" and "simple": You quit your job.  Became a bartender.  Bought a bike.  Shaved off your hair.  The New You;  The Look of Less Responsiblity.  All of it so cool and colorful.    But the rest of me sees the cracks in the walls, the clumsy paint in the bedroom.  God, and those silly stars you've put on your ceiling.  There's something posed about all of it; a kid clomping around in his father's grown-up shoes.  You're no more ready for the responsibilities that come with love now than you were six months ago.    I don't miss you.    I cried today because of what it means to have stood in your apartment, having no more to say to you than an awkward salesperson.  It is the most horrible moment in the world, and it ran over me like water.  The memories and the familiarity.  The closeness.  All of it tumbling into the terrific, uncomfortable gap between us.  Piece by piece it crumbled and left only the knowledge that we (I had you inside of me.  I tasted your tears.) don't know each other at all.  As I got into the elevator (I stood there willing it to come and take me far away and quickly) I was teasing you about your age.  You replied, "To me you're always gonna be twenty-two."  Maybe the comfort is there.  That, somewhere, frozen and packed away like ice-cubes, is the best part of our six months--a little time-line drawn on a wall far back in a corner of the universe, documenting just 'hello' and an afternoon or two in your white summer bed.  Not at all part of any present.  Just a fresh line in a corner, stringing together some few happy words.    All the rest should be left out.  I got out of the subway and stepped out onto Canal Street this afternoon after seeing you.  The sun was bright and the street was bursting with foreign noises and paper fans.  Tiny turtles swam in their plastic cases, held in the grubby fingers of children who were sure to kill them soon.  Brilliant clusters of fake Prada bags.  Shiny toys and noises.  The hiccups of people jumbling together.   How can you be where you were?  And how did you find the way--with your mind your only measure?   This is a strange place to me still.  My new job in this new neighborhood, just like my new home in Brooklyn, has nothing to do with you.  I find them both a bit strange and scary, a bit exotic and thrilling.  I stand in the street--on this day that has come (finally) After You--in a present that is mine to stumble into.  Mine to own.  ***

       I am sick of:  1) Paying to meet people to date.     2) BOOM. pause. BOOM. pause. BOOM. Again today.  All day.  Again. 3) Not being famous. 4) All of my clothes.  Especially the ones on my floor.  Ditto: shoes. 5) The deli downstairs which is the only place I ever go for lunch because I'm lazy. 6) My laziness. 7) My height. 8) Spring pastels. 9) The phone that sits on my desk, taunting me all day with its maddening ring. There it goes again. 10) The holiday coming up that shall remain nameless because it is God forsaken and cruel, taunting me and my loneliness with it's fucking yummy fucking heart-shaped fucking candies in every drugstore fucking window. 11) Paris Hilton. 12) Missing Sunday brunch because I work weekends. 14) People telling me I am good at my job.  Don't they understand that being good at this parrots-could-do-it-well job makes me want to slit my wrists the right way? 15) The subway. 16) January. 17) The homeless woman on my street who won't ever take (fresh) food but will always ask for money. 18) My mess. 19) Diet Coke instead of regular. 20) Searching The New York Times Sunday Styles section to see if any of my ex-boyfriends* are getting married.  *M  I am NOT sick of:  1) Um...  fuck it.  bedtime.

      Soho.  In a trendy boutique desperately seeking the Yeti of the winter-fashion season--the top that is both ravishingly sexy but also long enough to cover the long underwear I'm wearing underneath my low-rise jeans.  She says: "Honey, God, I love, love, LOVE this skirt."  He offers hopefully: "Yeah, it'd look great with some--um--really high boots."  She says: "Right?"  As they leave she adds: "And we'll totally have to think about that cute sweater from before."  I try to imagine what it would be like to be part of a couple who thinks about sweaters.    ***  Also Soho. A perfectly lovely normal-sized girl emerges from a dressing room wearing a short skirt and top: "What d'ya think?"  Her boyfriend: "I don't know.  It doesn't look like that on the mannequin."  The size 0 mannequin.  With HUGE breasts, a metal rod up its ass, and no head.  ***  My acting class.  An Actor: "Yeah, I rocked my audition this week.  It was great.  I totally brought it.  I mean, I could see the energy.  And I was open and in the moment and feeling it.  My mantra and the character's mantra just melded into this one single mantra, which was just, "It's my turn."  It's my fucking turn.  And after that it was just about The Work.  I mean that's what it's about for me.  The Work."  An Actress: "Yeah.  Totally.  The Work was great tonight."  Another Actress: "What got me into The Work tonight--and it may sound silly?--but it was just, like, that I started to think of all of the emotions in the scene as colors?  And, like, anger was purple?  And love was, like, peach?  And every time I felt my energy closing, I was like, Amber, go toward the peach.  I just said that over and over.  Like, Amber, go toward the peach."  Another Actor: "The Work brought up a lot for me today.  And, frankly, I'm still caught up in our Christmas Message from last month. About affirming the Self and Positivity.  There are really some things I'm looking at from my childhood, and I think The Work's going to really grow because of it."  ***  Boy at bar trying to pick me up and doing a good job of it until: "So this girl and I just buy a bag of blow and go back to my place.  And obviously I can't get hard when I'm that fucked up, so we just take off all of our clothes and keep snorting the shit.  And then she finds this lipstick that she doesn't like in her purse, and we just start going crazy and writing all over each other with it. And we're naked and the shit was like everywhere.  We showered it off later and when I woke up the next day my bathroom was just covered in red shit.  I mean it looked like someone had been murdered in there or something."   (Female readers, of course, will find this story doubly disturbing because they will realize that no one keeps a lipstick they don't like in their purse.  Lipsticks that one doesn't like are kept in plastic containers under the bathroom sink, or in the upstairs bathroom of your parent's house.  Meaning that this particular cracked-out young woman spent the night writing on a naked stranger with what was undoubtedly her favorite lipstick.  So sad.)  ***  And finally, a group of teenage tourists that I passed on my way to the N/R Downtown train at 23rd Street.  Boy Tourist in hushed whisper: "Guys, Look!  Cameron Diaz!"  I would like to buy this boy an airplane.

      My faithful and brilliant reader Sam had requested in his comment last Wednesday that I try to get picked for a murder trial.  I gave it my all, Sam.  Just for you.  But, in the end, the nearest I could get was a stabbing involving two drug dealers and no witnesses.  Good enough?  We're talking attempted murder, crack cocaine, word against word, deception, revenge, punishment--the whole shebang.  This was high stakes, Ladies and Gentlemen.  And I took my civic duty very seriously.  Very seriously, just as the video with Jane Pauley and the cast of  60 Minutes  had instructed me to do.  All day I looked deep into the heart of my belief system, trying to come to terms with the qestion I was faced with in that sacred hall where Truth reigns supreme:  Was the defense attorney wearing a wig?  Frankly, Guys, I still don't know.  Having now witnessed the American Justice System in action, I have come to some major conclusions.  Those of you studying law would be well advised to print these next lines and refer to them often:  1) The American Justice System could use a new instructional video; 1970 was a bad, bad year for Jane Pauley.  2) The American Justice System's new instructional video should, however, keep the scene where the medieval extras tie up an accused thief and throw him into the lake to see if he floats (guilty) or sinks to his death (innocent).  It's funny.  3) The American Justice System has yet to incorporate either of the following two concepts: "good lighting," "joie de vivre."  4) The American Justice System vs. A Barrel of Monkeys?  Monkey Barrel.  No contest.  My last observation regarding The AJS is of a more personal nature.  My day as a juror proved to me--beyond any reasonable doubt--that I have no shame left and can cry about M absolutely anywhere.    Awesome.

      If any of you reading this happen to be responsible for operating a very large piece of machinery in the vicinity of E. 8th St, whose purpose--as near as I can tell--is to  POUND LOUDLY ALL DAY , thank you.   You are responsible for my new game:   Hell   "Hell" (copyright pending) is a game in which you ask yourself the question, "What would be worse than this?"  It should be played whenever things are going really badly.  If, for example, there is a  DEAFENING BOOMING NOISE  emanating from a machine that is located about  SIX INCHES FROM YOUR OFFICE WINDOW , you should play "Hell."  It will make you feel better.  All of you good, God-fearing people out there, may be tempted to play "Hell" in the following way:    Today is a bad day.  I'm going to play that new game, "Hell."  Let's see.  How could this day be worse?  Hmmmm.  This day could be worse if it was -raining-.  This day could be worse if I was -poor-.     And so on.  If these were your answers, you suck at "Hell."  Stop playing.  We don't want your kind here.  "Hell" is not politically correct.  It is mean-spirited.  It is nasty.  "Hell" is about digging deep into yourself to find out what makes you squirm and kick and want to vomit, and then bringing those things to the surface and staring directly into their beady, pink-eye infested eyes.  The result?  Suddenly your whole world will seem a little more tolerable.  My Hells--as of about 4:30 EST--are:  * Note: Each "Hell" scenario should be considered  eternal  unless otherwise noted.*    1) Being forced to walk through the (disgusting, litter-filled) underground part of the Times Square subway station during the height of rush-hour on the hottest, most humid day of the summer.  In this Hell, I would be naked except for a short fur coat that made me pour sweat but still left my lower-half totally exposed to all of the thousands of dirty strangers pushing past me in the stifling heat.  2) Being forced to give Golem a blow-job.  If Golem has no genitals, then I guess being forced to let him go down on me would be just as bad.  Maybe worse.  There.  See?  This infernal pounding seems like nothing now.   Toodles.

      A few things keep me up at night.  Among these are:   * My pure and silent hatred for the person responsible for the front-page headlines of  The New York Post .  For example, a recent article on property value assessment, "TAXMAN GIVES HOMES A KICK IN THE ASSESS."  Such terrible punning has not been seen since 1984 when seven-year-old Joey Zileski discovered Knock-Knock Jokes and went around asking anyone who would listen, "Orange you glad I'm not a banana?".  * The fact that I had a crush on Joey Zileski and used to think--each time he asked this stupid, stupid question--"Yes, Joey.   Yes!  I  am  glad you're not a banana.  If you were a banana,  who would there be for me to love?   *  urlLink This .   urlLink And again .   urlLink Everybody now !  The last and most recent addition to this list ( MOM, STOP READING HERE ) is this:   *  The fact that I had my only non-self-induced orgasm with a guy who I met on an on-line dating website.     God, I know.    And I didn't even  like  him.  All those years in college with soft-lipped, golden-tongued lads who spent hours trying to work out the complexities of their womb-envy issues with their heads entrenched firmly between my thighs.  All those dear, dear ex-boyfriends (except for M.  He's sexually inhibited.) armed with honeyed words.  And actual honey.  Prepared to dig in and last until I came, or lose their lives tr--well, hold on a second.  I mean we musn't get too overdramatic about their sacrifice.  Blow jobs, after all, can be an awful pain.  These boys just gave their tongue a little workout is all.  And their egos got a tad deflated.  But anyway, what I'm trying to get at is that much time and man-power (and even a bit of girl-power that one semester) has been put into trying to make me come.  And what did we all get for our efforts?    We know that honey is still both sticky  and  sweet.    Yep.    Both.     Still.      Even after all this time.  Meanwhile, after seven years of trying.   After some hundred-odd nights or so of me ooohing and ahhhing and moaning, squealing, sighing and (after yoga once) quietly concentrating on the image of a single candle burning brightly in my mind's eye.  After making out with boys I lusted after and idolized and loved and hated and envied and just generally felt a whole smorgasbord of feelings about.  After.  All.  That.  Along comes this guy who uses "LOL" a lot.    And he makes me come on the first try.     Five times.         ....So.  ANYway.  Back to what I know is on all of our minds.    Uh-huh.  He uses "LOL" all the time.  Right?  I know.  I hate it too.    And curiously, as it turns out, my hatred for his use of "LOL" is pretty much the strongest emotion I will have about him all together.  Because he's...I don't know.  Fine.  Normal.  Very nice.  Rides a motorcycle, so that's cool.  He takes me out to dinner several times and is a gentleman (no posing, no car accident photos).    But he also has the following strikes against him:  Strike 1: He is a professional gambler.  For real.  He plays poker until like eight in the morning at this secret location on the Upper Westside.  Kind of sexy/mysterious in a Robert De Niro in  Casino  way, right?  You might think so.  In the beginning I totally did.  I was psyched and shopping for a red sexual-lady-killer dress to wear as I stood behind him at the card table massaging his shoulders and waiting for him to give me the signal that Shorty was in position out back and we could go ahead with our plan to steal the diamond.    Strike 1 Con't: But then when I actually saw him go to the secret location once, it was a real let-down.  Let's put it this way: he certainly doesn't have to get hand-printed or retinally-scanned before they let him into the smallish, crappy-ish regular-old apartment building where he goes to play cards with fat men from Jersey.  The sexual-lady-killer dress has been returned to the store from whence it came.  Strike 2: He loves Andrew Lloyd Webber.  Really.  Strike 3: He and his last girlfriend used to get up in the early morning on Saturdays and do things like, say, bike to Pennsylvania.  He once used the word "triathalon," in the same sentence as my name.  It made me belly-laugh.  So, anyway, I wasn't, like, scribbling teeny hearts around his name on all my notebooks or anything.  No, Sir.  I was definitely keeping the whole thing in perspective.   And by our third date I was pretty much ready to call it quits.  So when he invited me back to his apartment to play Scrabble, I thought, "How perfect.  After all, nothing says 'Let's Just Be Buddies' like a board game."    Incidentally, after arriving at his apartment I was able to add a "Strike 4" to the List:  Strike 4: The majority of his decorations seemed to have been stolen from the kind of hotels that are frequented by truckers.  Our game of Scrabble goes well, but I am so busy trying to get rid of my "Q" that I decide to forgo the "Friend Speech" for now.   After Scrabble, a movie.  Which is fine, I think, because I make him watch  Finding Nemo  and the only thing that says "Let's Just Be Buddies" more than a board game is a movie about a funny cartoon fish.  But this is where my "Friend Boundaries" get a little hazy.    When he tries to hold my hand during the movie, I am firm.  Friends do not hold hands.  We're clear on that.    When he tries to kiss me, I am firm.  Friends do not French kiss.  Clear.    But then he  gets down on his knees and says, "I just want to taste you."      Um...  ...  ...  Ladies and Gentlemen, I ask you, "What  is  a friend?"      Friends borrow and lend things.  They share things--secrets, sweaters perhaps.  Gum.  If we were at the movies I would let my new friend have some of my Junior Mints or a sip of my Coke.  (As long as he didn't have a cold.)  I see no problem, then, with his request.    He is simply asking, as a friend, for a taste of my--  He wants me to  share  a bit of my--   Oh, FUCK THE FRIENDSHIP BOUNDARIES.  The guy wants to lick me like I'm ice-cream in August and that's fucking fine with me.    So he whips off my pants and just starts going to town.    And, this next part you may find hard to believe, but I'm pretty  urlLink pococurante  about the whole thing.  (Honestly.  I am.)  I'm not overcome by the throws of passion (like I've been before).  His technique is strong, but not extraordinary (like I've had before).  It's all just...fine.  And since none of the extraordinary, passionate encounters I've had before have done the trick, it seems logical that this totally...nice...encounter will fall flat as well.  So I just figure he'll go down on me for a little while, I'll sit here and watch some  Nemo  (those sharks are so funny) and eventually he'll get frustrated and fall asleep.  After I've rewound the shark scene a couple of times, though, I'm starting to be distracted.  I mean, he's still down there, trying to figure how many licks it's gonna take to get to my tootsie roll center.   Figuratively speaking, of course.    But where is this going?  I mean, I'm not gonna fake it.  And I don't want him to feel like I owe him something for his troubles because I'm not gonna sleep with him.  Frankly, I don't want to do anything to him at all really.  I'd just like to lie here, watch  Finding Nemo  and have him lick away for a while.  (Hey, at least I'm honest.)   I decide I should warn him.  Just let him down gently so the ol' ego doesn't get too bruised.  This first part I deliver in my breathy phone-sex voice just so he can feel good:     "Ummm.  That feels so good.   Really, really...oooh.  Really good."   This second part I deliver in my teacher voice because after awhile my phone-sex voice makes me cough:    "But, just so you know.  I can't come.  I'm broken or something.  No biggie.  No one's ever been able to do it but me.  Just wanted to give you the heads up."   (Last parentheses, I swear.  This one's important.    Ladies.  If you wanna get your man to hustle,  My Number One Secret Sex Tip  is this.  Tell him that no man has ever made you come before.  Though in my case it was actually true, whether or not you've had a partner make you come, just tell 'em all you haven't.  It's unbelievable how much they want to be the first.  Silly men.  We wuv you so much, you wittle silly willy guys.  Seriously, though I don't mean to make fun.  It's really cute.  They just try and try.  And even if they don't actually get you there  a good time will be had by all .    So don't say I never did anything for you.  Bitches.)  Well.  Just as I am finishing my last sentence.... WHAM!      Just like that.  Out of nowhere.  After seven years.    Seven.    Years.  I lie perfectly still while he continues on his merry way, unaware of the  urlLink miracle  that has just occurred.   Wait.  Oh my God.  Stop.  Stop.  Oh my God!  I just CAME.  You made me come!--      Now I just don't get it.  I just don't.  Though the number of people I've had actual intercourse with is not so high, the number of people I've let go down on me is...kind of up there.  And there have been, (as  urlLink the old Armour Hot Dog jingle   used to say) some fat--well, we'll call them well-fed--men, some skinny men, some men who may have, indeed, climbed on rocks.  Some tough men.  One sissy man that one time in Italy ('nother story, 'nother time).  And, as of yet no men with chicken pox, but you'll never hear me sayin' never.  (I've already had chicken pox.  So, you know.  Anything for a sick friend.)  Then, WHAT THE FUCK?  Since it obviously couldn't have been this guy, what was it?  Something I ate?  Or didn't eat?  Was it an astorlog--an asterol--was it in the stars?  Or was it...the movie?    Wow.  That'd be weird.  I'd be  so weird .  Turned on by cartoon sea life.  That  urlLink Calypso-singing lobster  from  The Little Mermaid  desperately clinging to my nipple as I moaned "Find me, Nemo.  Yes! OH, Yes!  FIND! ME!".  God, I'd be more weird than those people who like to get dressed up in those huge, ridiculous looking animal-costumes and have sex.  What are they called?  Furbies or something.  Only they at least have clubs and web-sites and things for the furbies.  'Cause let's be honest, ok.  Let's not fool ourselves, here.  I'd be dealing with a rather limited dating pool.  The only other cartoon fish I can really even think of is that goldfish that that black-and-white cat in  Pinocchio  (?) is always trying to get out of its bowl.  And he's probably from a petshop or something, not the sea--so who knows if he'd even do the trick?  So I would just be alone in my room watching two fucking Disney movies over and over and over again.  And what kind of a life is that?  And once I'd gone through all the cartoon sealife in those movies.  What then?  I mean, really.  What next, huh?  WHO WOULD FUCK ME THEN?  I WANNA KNOW! WHAT CARTOON FISH AM I GONNA FIND THAT'S GONNA  ***Bleeeeeeeeeeeeep***     MOM, START READING AGAIN HERE:    ...And, my friends,   that   is the story of how Jingle The Dancing Panda and her puppy, Button, brought new joy to Cupcake Town.

      Buster B. Bumbles The Monkey-Doodle King, is the name of my mother's shitzu.  I can't help wishing we had named him something more practical.  Here is why.   My new fear is   That I will run into M. with his new girlfriend.   The horrible scenario of our meeting is as follows:  I am walking down Broadway on the Upper Westside.  Luckily, because I am fully aware that this is M's neighborhood and because I am psycho, I am dressed in a cute Saturday afternoon outfit that took hours of careful planning, but looks as though I just picked it up off of my floor and threw it on.  (It should be noted that I only go for the Saturday-Afternoon Casual Look out of necessity.  It is not my best Look.  If I could get away with it, I would just spend most of my Saturdays strutting up and down Broadway between about 86th St. and 79th in an evening gown, displaying my glamorous Saturday-Night Black-Tie Gala Look, which always steals the show.  Or, at least  would  steal the show if I ever actually got invited to a Black-Tie Gala.)  ANYway, having picked out and put on my perfect Saturday-Afternoon-Casual-Look Outfit (the one that says, "Hey, look at me, I just got back from a seaside vacation where I spent hours journaling and running in the surf.") I am feeling great.  In fact, I am practically skipping down the street, because I am already aware that The Universe hates me.  Therefore, The Universe would never ever ever let me see M when I'm looking hot.  So, obviously I will not see him today.  Nope.  Never ever ever.  Nope.  Not today.  Not tod--  And there they are.  (Fucking Universe with its fucking irony.)  ...And they're walking towards me, waving.    ...And she's wearing his sweatshirt, which means that her outfit kicks the ass of my outfit because her outfit says, simply, "He's my boyfriend now, Skank."  ...And my outfit is sad because its ass has just been kicked.  ...And I am sad because I have just swallowed my gum.  Though I try to psych myself up for this now unavoidable encounter by rapidly making a mental list of everything I've accomplished since our break-up, I fail.    Then I try to think sexy thoughts.   But I fail at that too, because all I can think of is the time when I was five and my aunt took me to the zoo where we saw elephants, and I wanted to eat like they did, so I shoved peanuts up my nose and we had to go to the hospital.  So. Not. Sexy.  Then I panic.    Now, for some reason, when I panic my brain goes into this strange mode where it churns up storylines and quotes from old sitcoms.  Believe me, if I had the kind of brain that churned up useful, smart, witty-banter kinds of quotes from old sitcoms, I would be pleased.  If, for example, my brain in a panic spoke like the cast of  The West Wing  I would love my brain.  LOVE it.  But  my  brain tends to run more towards, oh...He-Man cartoons.  So that explains why I suddenly can think of nothing but  urlLink  Punky Brewster  , a sitcom about this little spunky orphan and her playful golden-retriever, Brandon.  And there's this episode where Punky has a crush on this older guy....   Meanwhile, M has begun to speak to me:  M: Hey, Kate.  I've been thinking about you.  It's so great to see you.  This is my girlfriend.  We were just on our way to her photo shoot.   ...and Punky really, really likes him.  Likes him even more than she likes her dog, Brandon. And she gets all happy whenever this older boy comes around.  Sure, he's eighteen, and she's, like, nine, but her love is pure.  And she thinks they'll be together forever.  Because she's so certain that he loves her too.  And they pal around for the whole episode...   M's New Girlfriend: Oh my Gosh!   You're  Kathryn!  Wow.  It's amazing.  M was totally right.  You two  do  look like brother and sister.   ...and then one day Punky's crush comes over to her apartment and he brings along his eighteen year old girlfriend because he wants to show off and make sure his girlfriend sees that kids just adore him.  And PUNKY IS CRUSHED; she didn't know he had a girlfriend, and she can barely keep the tears from coming.  And then her crush starts to rave about how cute Punky is, and it's so patronizing...   M: Yeah, I know.  That's what I always thought when we were dating.  She totally looks like she could be my sister.   My cute, chubby little sister, you know. *puts his hand on New Girlfriend's ass*  Doesn't that explain so much about why I was never attracted to you, Kate?     ...and the girlfriend of Punky's crush tries to be nice to Punky and says that Punky's so cute she  must  have a boyfriend.  And Punky just stands there with tears in her eyes...   New Girlfriend: You know, Kathryn.  Can I call you Kate?  I have a friend who I'd totally love to set you up with--Oh...I'm sorry.  I guess I just assumed that you're single.  You are single, aren't you, Kate?   ...and, finally, Punky--who, even with her limitless Punky Power has been reduced to a whimpering love-sick fool by this nineteen-year-old and his tarty little girlfriend--decides to lie.  Knowing that she has no -real- boyfriend to describe, and knowing that she never told her crush about her dog, she responds, "Yes. Yes, I do have a boyfriend.  His name's um...Brandon.  And he has reddish-blonde hair.  And brown eyes.  And he's great.  Because. *sniff* He takes walks with me in the park. And. *sniff* He kisses me when I'm sad. "   (God.  It's SO pathetic.  Nine-year-old girl lies to her crush, only a split second after he's broken her heart, by telling him about her imaginary boyfriend who, as it turns out, is really just her faithful, but slobbery dog?  Un-fucking-believable.  I have only three words for you: Punky.  The.  Musical.  She'll make that bitch Annie look like the cracked-out orphan street-trash that she is.)  But, uh-oh!  Wait a minute.  My panic-stricken brain won't think this pathetic sitcom plot should be relegated to Ole' Broadway.  NO.  If I ever do actually run into M and his New Girlfriend on the street, my blitzed-out sitcom-loving brain will be primed and ready to  try this scenario in real life.   So, when M's hussy of a girlfriend asks me if I'm single, there is a good chance that I will reply with something like:  "No, no I have a boyfriend.  His name's, um, Buster Bumbles. *sniff* And he has white hair.  And big, black eyes.  And *sniff* he sleeps in the bathtub when it thunders...."     Yeah.  It's not gonna be pretty.

      I went to this party once in this huge loft in Soho.  The host of the party had decided to invite...oh, pretty much  everyone  to his house for drinks and dancing.  And we get there and there are just waves of people.  We're all mushed in together, all elbows and pushing and cigarettes-become-dangerous.  It felt like being inside a crowded subway   car--it was that uncomfortable and about as personal.  At some point I noticed people writing on the walls in permanent-marker.  They were mostly scribbling.  A few played tic-tac-toe.  Every white surface was ripped soon by huge black and red gashes.  There's a hand on my ass and my nose is in someone else's collarbone.  The music is so loud it's no longer music, and the jolting hasn't stopped since we stepped into the room.    I am handed a plastic cupful of something lukewarm.  As I take it, there's a smash and half of it spills on my dress.  But my friends don't notice because they've started yelling into the ears of strangers.  So I just lean my head up and stare at the ceiling, feeling exactly like I do in the movie theater when everyone else is looking at the screen and I'm turning 'round to stare at the people.

      This morning I felt like everything was  enough : this new manager I'm working with, the new agent, my breakfast, my walk to work.  Then why is it that I'm going to bed now and I feel...I don't know?  Imaginary.  Every day, I think, I just make myself up.   We'll all hate him again together tomorrow, I promise.  But right now, I just thought of it--(God someone should invent a pill for this.) He read to me sometimes.    I don't--I mean.  Well.  So what.  He read to her too.  funny again tomorrow.  promise.

      Well, guys, it pains me to say it, but Le Secret Plan is off.    Sorry about all those down-comforters and tires....  I guess, um, just tar and feather someone you hate on your own or something this weekend.    The reason that Le Secret Plan (and, hell, we might as well just refer to it as "The Secret Plan" now so that everyone out there who doesn't speak French can get caught up) has been nixed is...  My mom found out about it.  She found out about it because I called her last night to tell her she might not be hearing from me for awhile.  (I know I shouldn't have said anything.  DON'T RUB IT IN!) It was just that, with me being huge and gigantic-sized and all I figured I might have some trouble dialing her number on my itty-bitty cell phone keypad, so I just wanted to be fair and give her a heads up and tell her I loved her, blah, blah, blah.    So we're talking and one thing led to another, and she wanted me to explain "Le--sorry," I mean " The  Secret Plan".  So I did.  I told her that Leticia and Sam and Zed and I and all my other 800-or-so new internet friends were all in on a totally awesome secret plan to tar and feather The Unholy Slut-Whore From Hell, and how after she was covered in goo and feathers and apologizing for   riding  my boyfriend  like she was an Indian and he was a wild pony running free through the hills of Montana , I was going to use my secret potion to grow to a really enormous (but still gorgeous) size and  STOMP HER FUCKING BRAINS OUT!!!      To which my mom replies:   "Just as long as no one's feelings get hurt, Kate."   ....If, at around 9:47 Eastern Standard Time any of you heard a kind of rushing, woosh-sound sweeping through the air like a horrible, sucking vampire banshee newly released from hell, don't worry....   That was just the sound of Maternal Guilt descending down to Earth in order to ruin a perfectly good secret plan.

       If you're F, the woman who M cheated on me with, STOP READING THIS NOW because I'm planning you a surprise birthday party as a peace offering (bygones) and I totally don't want to ruin the surprise.  'Kay?    Ok.  Now that The Unholy Slut-Whore From Hell has stopped reading, everyone who's left huddle up close.  You are all in on what we will refer to in our secret plan language as, Le Secret Plan.  Heh heh heh. (I'm pretty sure the USWFH doesn't speak French.)  This morning on the subway I got sad.  The woman next to me was finishing a huge bag of sour cream and onion potato chips at 9 am.  Her totally terrible nutrition choice got me a little down, true.   But the real tears started when I realized...  ...that if I did get really really big for real and get to lumber (gracefully) around the city squishing people, I couldn't squish The Unholy Slut-Whore From Hell because I only met her once and  can't remember what she looks like .  (Editorial Note: I feel that, actually, that last italicized phrase should've been put in bold, but then I thought the USWFH's eyes might be drawn to it as she skimmed the page, and the proverbial jig might be up.  So I used italics instead.  Hehehe.  I am so smart and tricky.)   Well, anyway, back to Le Secret Plan.    So I and the team of great minds who have brought us The Olsen Twins and one-calorie soda (?) got together this a.m. and developed the  planne genius  (I couldn't help myself with the bold there, but don't worry.  The French will confuse her) that is currently unveiling...right...before...your eyes.  (God, this is fun.)  What I need from you my dedicated and gorgeous readers are two things:  Tar.   Feathers.   Oh, also quarters.  This last is because this upcoming Thursday is my laundry day, and now that I'm gonna be giant-sized more often I will have a lot of large clothes to wash.  So, everyone with me?  Great.  Go to it.  Leave work early.  Don't worry, your bosses won't care.  They hate her too.  Get home and start ripping open those down comforters and melting those tires.  We'll meet back here tomorrow.     In the meantime, I'm gonna go try to recreate that freakish chemical reaction that caused me to grow to a giant size in the first place.   For those who haven't yet read yesterday's post and need to be caught up, the ingredients are:  1) Fury.   2)  urlLink Mario Badescu Seaweed Body Lotion    3) OPI Nailpolish (Blushingham Palace, a shade from  urlLink The British Collection .)  It's gonna be a looong, hard day of pedicures and lotioning for me folks.  We do what we gotta.  (By the way, for all of you selfish, me-me-me kind of people who are in on Le Secret Plan, don't worry.  Once I get really big and have squished The USWFH I'll take requests about who to squish next.  So if there's someone you feel is in need of a squishing--or just a good scare--write to me and we'll see what we can do.)  GO TEAM!!      F,    START READING AGAIN HERE.   The surprise party is gonna be awesome.  Eeee.  I'm so excited!  I'm totally looking forward to the two of us being great friends just like Anne of Green Gables and her best, bosom chum-friend Diana.  But, because I just bought us those awesome heart-split-in-two Best Friend Lockets, I need you to do me one huge favor. *** PLEASE EMAIL ME YOUR PICTURE. ***  Email address is on the right.  Thank you.  Big Hugs! 'Kay.  Stop reading now.    Heh heh heh.

      Guys.   'Coupla things.     First: Apparently The Unholy Slut Whore From Hell is smarter than I thought.  Because...No picture yet.  The hussy must have heard something.    There's no way to be nice about this.     Which one of you talked?     I know it wasn't Linz or Sam because they're skinny perfect supermodel literary-genius angels.   It wasn't Leticia either.  Because she's a goddess, and I think she was in school all day anyway.  The rest of y'all...if you go over to The USWFH's side,  I will find you and cut you.     'Kay *claps hands excitedly*.   Right.  So,  meet me here tomorrow anyway, picture or no picture and we'll reasses Le Secret Plan.  Or just go for a beer.  Whatever.  Second: You may have noticed that there has been a slight name-change throughout this blog.  There used to be another letter of the alphabet standing in for my exboyfriend's name.  Now he is called M.  This happened because I have now realized that none of you can keep your mouths shut, so I figure we might as well use this to our advantage and give you the real first letter of his real name.    Do.  Your.  Worst.

      Answer the following.  On-line dating is:  a) Pathetic.  Girls who have to troll around on the Web looking for dates should just stick to what they know: girdles and Jane Austen.  My new boyfriend, M. and I were just talking the other day about how sad it is that some women turn to the internet because they're so desperate and lonely.  I wish I knew where those poor, desperate women lived so I could bring them a basket of warm muffins.  I don't eat carbs, but I'm sure  they  do.  ANYway, thank goodness  I've  never had to on-line date.  But, then again, why would I?  I mean, my thighs don't touch and I have such shiny, shiny hair.  b) Really fun.  I have met a ton of nice, laid-back guys who live life to its fullest and love to cook and travel.   These great guys take care of themselves mentally and physically.  It's so fun to have someone to explore the city with.  I've never known so many people who share my interests, which include, but are not limited to: rock-climbing, snowboarding, and appreciating the small things.  Like...um...those cute tiny poodles.  Oh, and that one actor who's really small.  Oh.   You know .  Oh...um.  Oh! * bounces up and down *  Elijah Wood.  c) Invented and maintained by the same great minds that brought us Pepsi Blue, a fusion of berries with a splash of cola. Making it actually blue was the real genius move there, Guys.  Way to leave your mark.   So, that was a fun little quiz, Yes?  To those of you who chose "Answer A": M will cheat on you like he cheated on me, Bitch.  Skinny whore. Your muffins suck.  To everyone else, Nice work.  You "Answer B" Gals will get what's coming to you any day now, and you "Answer C" Folk are well on your way to ending up bitter and alone.  So.  Great!  Let's move on.  What on-line dating did for  me  was lower my expectations.  A date is now considered a success if the man does  not   bring along pictures of a car accident victim who he's about to perform surgery on  .  It's that simple.  No dead or mutilated bodies = LOVE.  If only I had started on-line dating in middle school I would've figured this out, found true love, gotten married, gotten divorced, moved to the French countryside, grown long hair that I would wear only in chignons, and learned to ride horses...by now.  Too bad.  Back to the present.  So, I joined an on-line dating site as the result of a cruel urban myth.   Having attended an all-women's college and studied voice at a conservatory, I have two basic friend groups. Women. Gay men.  All the women I know only know other women, so our lives are just one big festival of heading to the ladies room together at restaurants and endlessly buying shoes, shoes, shoes.  Really my girlfriends and I do neither of these things, but a gal's got to keep  a few  things private now, doesn't she? ***      All the gay men I know just want to talk about the other gay men they know, and who's a Top and who's a Bottom.    Thus, when I dumped M (Bottom) and began scraping my heart off the pavement after The M Fiasco, I realized the following   Great Truth  : I needed a way to meet men who would want to touch my boobs.  And I needed it fast.   The Answer?   Well, here's the urban myth part. Everyone has a friend or a neighbor whose piano teacher's cat-sitter met a guy on "Connect.com" who she fell in love with and married. Even my mother was OK with me dating strange men I met online because a doctor who works with her at the hospital had a friend whose mother-in-law's cleaning-lady cleaned the apartment of a woman who met a guy on "Connect.com" who she (say it with me) fell in love with and married. Uh-huh.   So,* clapping vigorously * it must work.   Right.   Well, I'm afraid I have some bad news. All of those couples who met and fell in love while online dating are dead now. Most of the guys ate  urlLink Pop-Rocks  and then drank soda, accidentally causing their stomachs to explode. The women--who were grieving and lost without their men--stopped washing their hair, which gave spiders time to nest in their beehives, chew through their skulls (spider teeth are a bitch) and eat their brains.  We grieve for their loss.  We members of the on-line dating community who still remain--we who, with each new failed attempt at finding love on-line, rediscover the acrid taste of loneliness--will now share with you a more realistic account of what an on-line date is like:  THIS REALLY HAPPENED.  Mostly.  Me: "Hey,  T.  It's so nice to meet you."  T: "Likewise.  I'm glad you found the restaurant alright."  Me  (who, when I got to this restaurant blanched and almost fainted because it's actually  located in the building where M works.   The irony is, like, tangible here, yes?) : "Yep.  Found it."  T, who is a plastic surgeon, orders a drink and looks at me knowingly, reaching into his coat pocket.  It should be noted that he has now known me for around forty-seven seconds.  T: "I've got a really tough surgery coming up in the morning."  He casually throws six or seven photos down on the bar.  Me (innocently picking up the photos, touched that T brought along pictures of his family and pets so early in our acquaintance): "Nice.  What are th--"  In my hands I hold not one, but  seven  pictures of a woman  whose  brain  I  can see.     She is what the French might call, Nose-less.  (Dear Lord, thank you for my nose.  I love it.  I love its small bump.  I love its nostrils.  I love that it tells me when I'm about to have a yummy treat.  Noses are a mighty blessing, and we are all truly thankful.)     First I'm speechless.  That passes quickly.  Obviously.  Then I'm suddenly really pleased with myself.  Ohhhh.  Right.   I know what's happening here , I think slyly.   I'm being  Punked  right?  Ashton, you nut.  Get out here.   Ashton doesn't show.  As I continue to stare dumbly at the photos this man has brought--to our date--of a newly disfigured woman whose life changed horribly two days prior when she was hit by a car, I get more and more...well.  Sad.   My vision begins to blur.  At that moment T, studying my nose intently, offers, "You know, I gave my last girlfriend a great discount on a rhinoplasty."   That's IT   My anger is so fierce that my body temperature begins to rise at an abnormally high rate, which in turn causes a freakish reaction to occur between the chemicals in my  urlLink Mario Badescu Seaweed Body Lotion  and my OPI Nailpolish (Blushingham Palace, a shade from  urlLink The British Collection . It's a sweet, dusty pink that's royally pretty)  I begin to grow and grow and grow.  Luckily my outfit grows with me, so I'm not just a really, really big naked girl standing in the middle of a restaurant.  No way.  I am a really, really big girl in a really, really big, awesome outfit standing in the middle of a restaurant.  Obviously, I'm still totally gorgeous, just on a larger scale.  And I am fucking pissed.  "Listen," I bellow, staring down at my now-puny companion, "You're an asshole.  You bring in these pictures of a patient who's just undergone a horrible tragedy--a patient who trusts you--so that you can  show off ?  Perhaps you're hoping to highlight the fact that you're a plastic surgeon and you know a lot about anatomy, and you're well educated and powerful, blah, blah, blah.  Well I know a lot about anatomy too, Cocksucker, because it was my favorite class in high school.  And you make me feel sick right in my duodenum.  You make me and my metatarsals and my phalanges and, hell, even my hyoid bone, absolutely fucking sick.  So, since I just happened to grow really really really big right now at the absolute perfect time, I'm gonna do the world a favor."  And I squish him.  Then I lumber away to find M and his new girlfriend and squish them too.    Later, as I am galumphing (sexily) down the street in my huge, awesome shoes, thoroughly satisfied by a full day of squishing, I am momentarily stricken by the following thought:   I am now so big that there is no one in the world big enough to date me.   For a brief moment, I get really sad.  But then, far below me I hear this girl talking to her friend about the new, wonderful man she met on Connect.com.  (Since her thighs touch, I don't squish her).  I bend down to listen to this girl talk about Mr. Wonderful On-Line Dating Man, and...as I do...I notice a spider silently burrowing his way into her beehive.   The eight-legged little guy flashes me a toothy grin just before he disappears into her hair.     Yes, I chuckle to myself,  Being single is awesome.     ***Coming soon: The gym apparatus that makes me come.

      Hemingway says to write the truth.  One line followed by another.  So, Mr. H. this one' s for you:  I sometimes stand in front of my mirror naked and grab the fat on the back of my thighs and pull really hard just to see what it would be like to have legs like a runway model.  And if I could make it fit, I'd use one of those  urlLink claw hair-clip thingies  to pinch the fat back there permanently, and then I'd just cut holes in the back of all of my pants so there'd be room for the clip to stick through.  And I'd walk around like that.    Which would mean I'd have to never let anyone see me from behind because then they'd know my hair-clip secret.    I think never letting anyone see me from behind would be difficult, but not impossible.   Truth.

       Oh MY GOD.   I am at work and there is a woman  breastfeeding her baby in my office .  She just finished getting a tour of the apartments in the building and, as the sales agent I work with was finishing up her presentation, this woman just picks up her baby, lifts up her shirt,  whips out her boob  and lets the baby go to town.  In my office.  Which is a place of business, by the way.  Not a hippie commune.  The sales agent, who is a far better person than I, understands that a baby's gotta eat when it's gotta eat.  "We have an empty office in the back if you'd be more comfortable there," she offers kindly.  "Oh, we're fine," giggles the woman while the baby starts making gross baby-monster sucking noises as it chugs milk from her boob.   Yeah, we're all just fine right here.  Me, my computer, my post-it notes, her exposed left breast, and her monster-sucking baby.    In my office.    Now they are sitting on the couch behind my desk, and her broker (a man) is trying to talk about mortgages and real estate taxes without looking at his client's exposed teat.  Awkward DOES NOT EVEN BEGIN to describe this situation.  And now the nursing woman--who apparently has no shame--is interrupting the conversation about mortgages to tell everyone--giggle, giggle--that the baby would "nurse at [her] breast until he was thirty" if she'd let him.  And then she informs us that, Oh my, he's biting her nipple.  Isn't that cute? Isn't motherhood wonderful? Giggle.  Unbelievably, the nursing woman seems to be waiting for one of us to offer a response to her little moony speech about breastfeeding.  So her real estate agent--who is hoping to make $35,000 or so in the process of selling her a new apartment--looks around awkwardly, sends up a silent prayer to heaven that  God be merciful enough to reach down and smite him, and ventures:   "Um.  Aww.  I mean.  It's cute...um...that he bit your..uh..your ni--nipple."     Oh my God.   The real estate broker stares sadly at his hands, feeling a great and humbling shame.  The nursing woman--who also, apparently, is oblivious to awkward silences--sits and glows and thinks about (I don't know) her cat and her baby and her cottage by the sea.  She is happy about her baby, and happy to have nipples, and even happier that those very nipples are now a hot, hot topic.  Giggle.  Her husband, who until now has been calculating mortagage rates and pondering monthly common charges, looks up, suddenly aware that another man has just commented on his wife's nipples.  Nipples which, he now realizes, this other man can actually see.    Mistaking me for an actual, trained Guest Relations Associate who would know the exact right thing to do right now, the husband looks to me for permission to punch his broker in the throat.  Happily, since I am just pretending to be a Guest Relations Associate for a little while until I win my Tony, I can do exactly what I do.    Which is burst out laughing.  I mean.  Come on.

      Let me tell you about this fun new game I'm playing.  It is called,  Find The Girl In The Bar Who I Think Is Probably M's New Girlfriend .  Here are the rules:  1)  She has to be prettier than I am.  2)  She has to look like she might have one of the following occupations: underwear model, rockstar, hot librarian.    3)  She has to be the kind of person who doesn't  look  like she does community service, but, when you follow her out of the bar, all the homeless people she passes say things like, "Hey So&So, thanks so much for the basket of muffins you brought us over at the shelter.  We really loved 'em.  See you next Sunday."  4)  When you position yourself near her to listen in on her conversation and see if she mentions M's name, she has to be talking (in Russian) about one of the following four things:   * How she deferred Harvard Med School to live in Paris for a year and paint.   * How sometimes it really hurts her to love the world so much. * How she and her new boyfriend were just talking the other day about how great she looks naked, and how nice that is for him since his last girlfriend was basically just one big fat-roll covered in stretch marks. * How, the other day, when she was feeding baby deer in the forest, she found the doorway to Narnia.  I hate my imagination.  I am officially psychotic.

      What a night.  I got all dressed up.  I did my make-up like Charlize Theron on the cover of _Time Out New York_.   I looked   hot.    Surely, I thought, I will be kissed.  This is what happened when I got to the bar:  No one talked to me. I lost my glove.

      For  urlLink Leticia M.:   I lost my virginity in eighth grade on a field trip to Milwaukee's Museum of Natural History.     We had come there, I think, to give my teachers a day off from talking about science fair projects and _Tess of the D'Urbervilles_.  I had come there with only one intention: to be near Andrew Morter, who I loved at the time with all of the focused concentration it took to love someone who barely spoke to you.    It happened in the rainforest exhibit, which is this huge room covered in green, mossy folds.  I remember shadows of plants everywhere, climbing the ceiling and thick on the walls.  Enormous flowers with petals that seemed to be not  colored , but bleeding.  I was, what?  Twelve?  And I had never been around the sound of so much moisture.  Even the iridescent beetles seemed erotic, pinned down as they were by the recorded rain trickling overhead.   I gave myself to him on the second level of the exhibit, in full view of both the Jennifer's, the museum docent and my Social Studies teacher, Mr. Doman.     Andrew was standing next to me near a cliffside that was lit from above.  The lamp, which was hidden by branches, was aimed and focused on six or seven stuffed Macaws.  I could feel the recorded noises that they made pulse down from the ceiling--rhythmic calls, counting each new moment of flightless rest.  And because I was twelve and rainbows still had meaning, I was captured by the colors that fell everywhere--from the lamp, from the birds' wings, from the strange, recorded freedom in their sounds.  I felt surrounded.  I felt seared by rainbows and the closeness of Andy's breath.    I stood there for minute after minute, transfixed by those six dead birds and the thirteen year-old boy body standing next to me.   I wanted--I didn't know what.  I wanted to point to those birds.   I feel that way,  I wanted to explain.    Just that way.  How they cry out.  How their mouths never move.    Gripping Andrew's hand, I pulled him forward and over the railing.  We scrambled onto the cliff.  My fingers slipped as I unbuttoned his shirt and frantically grabbed for his face.  I didn't know how to kiss him.  His hands felt sweaty inside my jeans.  Our teeth clicked.  Needles pushed through the black backs of beetles.  The sounds of recorded rain rushed overhead like saliva.   It really didn't happen that way.   A guy named Gustavo took my virginity in a dorm room five years later.  It was surprising and fast and we listened to Beethoven.  But, the trip to the museum really happened.  Though, in real life I don't think Andrew even went up to the second level.  I may have just brushed past him later by the cases of dead bugs, or stared at the back of his head on the bus willing him--tightly, silently--to see me.  I certainly never talked to him that day.  And if I had, it would've just been to mumble something about the rainforest exhibit.  Birds there.  I don't know, parrots or something.    And the birds are true.  Also, something was caught that day, pinned down for a moment just before it changed or flew.  All the rest of it really didn't happen.  But it should have.

      It can't be helped.  I am just completely and utterly happy.  I am joyously looking at a lifetime of happiness with the man I love, here in my cottage by the sea, with my pet.    Nope.  Its just not me.  I can't remember how I came across her, but I stumbled on a blog yesterday written by a girl living, apparently, in a cottage by the sea (?) with her man and her cat.  And perhaps I caught her on a bad--er, well, good--day, but all she had to say about herself was that she liked the sea and she liked her cat, and she really really loved her man, and life was great and she was gloriously happy and content.  In her cottage.  By the sea.  (Sorry, but I just can't let that go.  I mean, who lives in a cottage by the sea.  What is this girl, a mermaid?)     (Even more to the point, do you think she might be M's new girlfriend?)  Well, in any case, she's got me thinking.  First of all, I think I may hate her.  I mean, here I am in Manhattan, living in a room the size of a tampon dispenser and frickin' on-line dating, and she gets to live by the bloody  sea  with the man she loves and her dear, darling cat?  I demand a recount.    Secondly, I feel kind of competitive towards her.  Which is a new thing for me (like the other day when I used the phrase "That's a horse of a different color" for the first time).  I want to one-up her happiness.  Just. To.  Make. Her. Miserable.    She thinks she can live in a cottage by the sea with her boyfriend and her cat?  Yeah, well I'm gonna move to a cottage in a daisy meadow by a meandering brook with my soulmate and our pet chicken, Sparkle.  And it will be Christmas every day, and we'll make our money by weaving daisy chain hats for all of our hippie friends, and Sparkle will lay golden eggs that, as it turns out, will make us live forever, which is great, because it'll give my soulmate and me an eternity of days to cultivate and grow our deep and beautiful love.    Also, Sparkle will beat her cat in a wrestling match.    And my soulmate will have a huge dick.   Editorial Comment:  Sparkle is a damn fine chicken.

      If I had to foster a guess as to when I realized that the latest perfect stranger I had decided to meet after seeing his blurred picture on an online dating site and exchanging a few awkward emails would  not  be the man I would marry--  Wait.  Let me start over.     'Kay.  How bout this.  I have discovered a disturbing trend among late twenty-something men.  They are beginning to pose.  As in to stand or lean back and arrange themselves in sultry or seductive positions while talking to me at bars.  Trust me when I tell you neither sultriness or seduction is being achieved.  Mostly they just end up looking like  urlLink twits .  They should all stop it.     Picture this: I meet this on-line guy for a drink at a trendy bar with lots of low mocha-colored couches.  He shows up wearing suede, which, admittedly, should have tipped me off.  If I someday have a daughter, one of the motherly bits of wisdom I may impart might have something to do with staying away from men who own suede outerwear.  The jury is still out on this one, but with each newly bedecked Banana Republic suede-wearing weirdo, my case only gets stronger.    Anyway.  To my point.  We sit on the couch and I'm excited.  Not excited like my-heart-is-behind-my-kneecaps-because-I'm-peering-into-the-future-at-our-beautiful-as-yet-unborn-children kind of excited.  More like the kind of excited you get right before you dive into a bowl of fairly good breakfast cereal--moderate to low.  I mean, he's cute.  Looks like the picture he sent.  Is tall. Ish. Does not appear to have brought along pictures of any car crash victims (this happened).  So romance may be in the air.  But then he starts doing it.  Each time I turn to look at him directly, he has stretched himself into a new, unnatural position.  First he leans in too close and tilts his head at a funny angle and makes his eyes look all  urlLink buggy .  I imagine he thinks his eyes look all "bedroom-y,"  but he also wears outerwear that is useless in the rain or snow, so this isn't the first time he's been wrong.   I ignore this initial offense.  Perhaps he is trying to make some sort of ironic physical comment on the New York over-the-top hipness of our ultra-mocha surroundings?  Perhaps he is having trouble seeing me in the dark bar?  I decide to give him The Benefit of The Doubt.  So, we continue our conversation, which, by the way, is so obviously first-date quality that men from around the bar actually come over to inquire as to whether this is, indeed, our first date and, if so, whether they might "have a go" at me.  (More on this later.  I hardly know where to begin.)   Minutes pass and my date asks me a question.  I turn to reply and....  He's doing it again.  This time it's  urlLink unmistakable:  lounging dramatically backward on the mocha settee, head cocked at an angle, eyebrows raised in a strange and silly manner that I suppose he imagines suggests satin sheets and swimming pools in South Beach.  He is also biting his lip.   Its true, it's true.  His lip is actually held between his upper and lower teeth to suggest...What?  His overwhelming desire to kiss me?  His ability to deliver great oral sex?  For a moment his intension remains unclear.  For the best, perhaps.  I answer his question and quickly turn my head.  But as I am looking away and mumbling something about the ladies room,                                    he                                             tries                                                   to                                                       kiss                                                             me.     At the risk of sounding juvenile,   Icky.  Icky.  Icky.  (Dear Lord, thank you for fast reflexes and good peripheral vision.  Thank you for a neck that works and can swivel a full 180 degrees.  These are small blessings, but they are indeed miraculous and I give you a big thumbs up for all your careful planning and anatomical foresight.  We'll talk some other time about body hair and the G-spot, but, in general, you've done a stand-up job.)  I escape by rushing to the ladies room where I find solace in cool running water and anti-bacterial hand soap.  I contemplate leaving, but, having left my coat and bag behind, this idea is nixed.    The first thing that happens upon my return from the bathroom is his blow-by-blow account of how many times he's had to hold up my handbag in my absence, thereby indicating to the  urlLink various women who were "all over him"  (and who are now, mysteriously, gone from the bar) that he is "taken."  I nod and smile and mostly wonder what the women thought of my handbag.      The second thing that happens is that his posing continues in full force.  Every time I look over at him he is pouting, pursing, leaning in, angling, lip-biting and generally lounging around with his eyes all big and "come-hither."  I stay until midnight as he makes his way through what must have been a lifetime's worth of swimsuit calendar poses.  After enduring just under two hours of his  urlLink coy girlishness , I claim fatigue and flee the scene.  (Admittedly, I should've left sooner, but I was all decked out.  And sometimes a girl just wants to sit back on a mocha-colored settee and enjoy a martini.  Or four.  Even if the guy she's with is a posing twit.)   If it sounds as if his behavior made him seem effeminate, IT DID.  Now, I'm not saying I need a man who can throw me down on the pile of wood he's just chopped and fuck me while crushing his used beer cans against my ass.  Though, come to think of it....  Hmmm.  Well, never mind.  But the  point      is that any man who seems to have practiced his facial expressions in front of a mirror comes across as a) vain and b) generally misguided.  Also, c) possessing a copious amount of free time.  And lest you say that one episode of this does not an epidemic make, may I also report that, on my plane ride home at Christmas, the attorney next to me bit his lip and lowered his head coquettishly--even threw in the old single raised eyebrow--as he asked for my phone number.     Clearly, action is necessary.  So, let us avoid all further confusion about the effectiveness of this courting strategy.    Boys.    Do not, under any circumstances, flex, arch, purse, lounge or otherwise arrange yourself in any artificial way, unless you can do it and  urlLink look like this.    Thank you.  In the meantime, any available woodcutters out there, I'm ready for you now.   Contact info is on the right.

      My current professional incarnation is: Receptionist.     Yeah.  I know.  Past incarnations have included: Talking Dog, Manager of large discount retail store in Lower Manhattan, Snow Queen, Think Tank Employee, Staff Interviewer for the college from which I graduated.  Some might call my employment history "a mess."  I prefer to think of it as "eclectic."    Additionally, some might call receptionist work "dull."  I prefer to think of it as "horrid."  Being a receptionist has dealt a near-fatal blow to my concepts of good and evil.  My intelligence is also staggering around on its last legs, as is my self-esteem.  I often think this must be the rock-bottom of my professional life, but then I realize that I'm not wearing a nametag or a uniform and suddenly I see that there is, indeed, further to fall.  Thank God.  Anyway, all I really wanted to say before I leave work for the day is this:  I hate everyone who, after calling to bother me with silly questions about apartments they can't afford, finishes the conversation by saying in a smarmy voice, "And who am I speaking to?"     This seems to me to be a thinly disguised way of saying, "I'm going to tell on you."  It bothers me endlessly.    I hate everyone.  Editorial Comment: I am not a receptionist.  My mistake.  I am a Guest Relations Associate.  A Guest Relations Associate who still hates everyone.

      Some days are better than others.    A good day post break-up:  Standing at a party with a drink in my hand, happy about whatever song is currently playing.  Happy to be included in the feeling of people when they're together and tipsy.  The sensation that everything is possible again.  Particularly the cute guy in the corner, who makes me feel curious and giggly.  Just a little.  Fine.  A lot.  Passing a stranger who whispers just loud enough:  urlLink "You're gorgeous."   Walking home at night.  Sharp sky.  Sharp sound of my feet on the sidewalk.  Full of cold.  Full of the evening and its conversations, its food, its drinks.  Alone, but feeling big anyway.  Feeling filled up and large enough to last.  A bad day post break-up:  Watching my youngest cousin touch his new girlfriend's hair, looking at her like she'd just been invented.  I'm on the couch across from them, working as hard as I can to forget how nice it feels when someone you like plays with your ears.  Trips into  urlLink The Land of Unanswerable Questions :  When did he start sleeping with her?  How many times?  When did they go to Washington D.C.?  Does he think of me now?  What does he remember?  Does he miss me?  Does he regret what he did?  And so on and so forth.  Being hit suddenly in a cab or on the subway, by an awareness of space.  How different...well,  urlLink how different   life     feels when there is no longer another body there to touch or bump up against.         And the worst, worst, worst of all:  waking up and realizing that I have been crying in my sleep.  Well.  Forward motion.  A toast (Coca-Cola in hand.  Told you I wouldn't be able to give it up).  To the day (Please get here fast) when M is just a letter and there's that feeling hovering close by all over again...    That anything can happen.    That I'm gonna love  urlLink what's coming next .

      71. I own two evening gowns that I have never worn.  I own these evening gowns because I am a person who engages in a practice I like to call, "Wishful Clothes Shopping."  The rules of "WCS" are as follows: 1) You must have absolutely no practical need for the item you are considering buying.  2) The item must be absurdly expensive.  Not  insanely  expensive, just absurdly so.  For those of you having trouble determining the difference, an  absurdly  expensive item causes you to say something like, "I can afford to buy this if I eat only Ramen for the next several weeks."  An  insanely  expensive item causes you to say something like, "I can afford to buy this if I pick up some extra pocket change by robbing the homeless."  3) The item must inspire an irrational and elaborate fantasy sequence that ends with the sentence, "And then he will realize he loves me."  For example, "Oooh.  Look at this $250 red cocktail dress.  I have no need for a cocktail dress.  My boyfriend has not ever invited me to cocktails.  But,  if he did invite me to cocktails  this is the dress I would like to wear.  I can see it now: he will call me up spontaneously from his office.  His friends, he will say, are meeting him for drinks after work, and he would like me to come.  Can I be there?  Of course, I will say.  Then I will go to my closet, put on  this  red cocktail dress, which I will be GLAD I purchased.  I will walk into the bar.  The skirt of this red cocktail dress will swish a lot, and men in top hats will escort me down a winding staircase.  At the bottom of which photographers will gather to take my picture.  My boyfriend will be standing just outside the crowd of flashing cameras.  His friends' mouths will be open in amazement.  That's your girlfriend? they'll say.  Yes, he will say.  And--though he didn't before--suddenly, because of  this red cocktail dress , he will realize he loves me."    For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about (probably men, mostly), it may be easier to understand WCS if you think back to the last time you bought sporting equipment.  You've not played soccer in five years.  And you sure could use the closet space that these shin guards and shoes would be taking up.  But, what if the guys call you up, say, this weekend and ask you to play? How cool would you be if you showed up wearing  these  awesome Nike soccer shoes?  How much better would your game be?  And so on.    72) For those of you who DO know what I'm talking about, take the number of Wishful Clothes Shopping items you've purchased.  Multiply it by seven.  Now you're in the ballpark with the number of Wishful Clothes Shopping items  I've  purchased.  Hold on a second, someone just gave the homeless guy over there a quarter....  73) I only set alarms for times that end in "six."  For example, If I am supposed to wake up at 8:00, I will set my alarm for 8:06.    74)  My favorite number is 1236.  I like it because it contains beautiful symmetries and patterns.  One being half of two and three being half of six.  Twelve going into thirty-six three times.  One times two is two, times three is six.  Etc.  Pretty, pretty, pretty.  75)  At important times in my life--i.e. when big changes are occurring, or something major is just around the corner--I automatically wake up in the middle of the night when the clock reads "1:11," "2:22," etc.     76)  Whenever I go to the top of anything very high (buildings, bridges, etc.) I have an almost overwhelming urge to drop something over the edge.  "Something" does not mean pennies or a pen cap.  "Something" means my keys.  My purse.  When I used to wear them, it meant my glasses.  I surreptitiously dangled my glasses over the ledge of the tower window of many a castle in Germany in my day.  Also from observation decks all over the United States.  It still makes my hands sweat with the temptation and risk of it.  77) I'm good at speaking and spelling things backwards.  .sdrawkcab  At a certain point in my life, I was obsessed with speaking backwards.  When I was going through this phase, I was much older than you're probably thinking I was.  No one understands you when you talk backwards, no matter how good you are at it.  Trust me.    78) There is a physical feeling that happens to me everytime I am lonely.  I feel it in my chest and my upper arms.  As though someone is drawing my blood with a needle from the inside.  Reverse misquitos.  It makes me remember filling the shirtsleeves of our scarecrow with cornhusks and prickly pieces of hay.    79) I love it when people notice a tiny black speck in the skin of my right hand.  I still have a piece of lead stuck there from where Maggie Bogenreef stabbed me with a pencil when I was nine.  80) I like seeing how far I can walk with my eyes closed.  I do it all the time in hallways and on emptier stretches of sidewalk.  Right now my record is forty-two steps.

      In bed time.  Saturday morning, when all the movement we've done has involved tossing blankets around.  He's reading aloud, the final paragraph in Durant's book about the Roman Empire.  It's writing for which the word "scope" was invented.    He loves it so much, it makes him cry.  There is a feeling underneath my skin as I watch him.  I think about trees and how, when you cut them in half, you can read the events of their lives in the rings.  You could see the mark of this morning.  If you broke me open now.

      So, it's like this.    I don't know what I'm doing.  I have just absolutely no fucking clue.  And when you've got nowhere else to go, and you don't know what to do, the perfect place to head, apparently, is Rehab.  Rehab is a club here in NYC.  Interestingly enough, by day it is a fairly tame restaurant that I've been to several times.  Long tables and chairs and waiters that move efficiently through the plastic and the metal to serve lots of things that contain arugula.  No big deal.    By night, different story.  Or so I discovered.  The line--of course the line, always the line--of people trying to get in at the front door.  The smokers puffing away in spite of the cold.  Not a woman in a long-sleeve shirt in sight: cut-outs, slits, tank tops, tiny straps, sequins, chandelier earrings, short-short-short skirts and eyeshadow up to there.  Greeted by two half-naked aqua colored dancers atop glowing platforms that are obviously never there at the same time as the arugula.  (Wouldn't be proper.)  Music pounding.  And away we go.  Into the arms of the crowd.  Into the legs and jumbling.  Eyes are slashed out by shadows.  No room in the noise for a voice or a word.  I have no idea what I am doing there.  I am twenty-five years old, and this is what twenty-five-year-old people do.  It's what they enjoy, and they launch themselves at each other and collide and smash.  They don't speak or touch.  But they fuck.  Have fun.  Dance.  Am I the only one who is thinking that this is all ridiculous?  I am the only one who is thinking that this is all ridiculous.  My friend Chris has his tongue already wound down some girl's throat, and his friend Isaac would love to have his down mine.  Which would have to be a secret, of course.  So his girlfriend in DC doesn't find out.  They're in love, you see.  And moving in together soon.  So shhhhhh.  Shhhhh.  But, come here.  If I wanted an answer about why M happened, I found it in Rehab.  What you learn there is that people are replaceable.  Flat and mechanical and as faceless as the music; if she won't do, the next one will.  Always another choice.  There will be something better at the next table.  People always celebrate this city, and it deserves its fair share of praise.  But I am tired of it tonight.  Very much so.    I think there are these moments that happen, sometimes, where you're standing at the beginning of something.  Or maybe at the end.  And everything all of a sudden seems large and important.    I think I'm at one of those.

      In college my roommate Tera fell into a K-hole.    For those of you who are not (as I was not) in the "know" regarding K-holes, a K-hole is something you metaphorically "fall into" when you have done too much of the drug K.  Never having done  any --let alone too much--K, I had no idea what a K-hole might be like.   I imagined it was probably very windy.  I imagined that Tera's eyes had probably suddenly turned into black and white spirals, like cartoon people's eyes do when they get hypnotized.  Her blue dress and white petticoats had no doubt billowed out around her as she floated by strange images of white rabbits carrying time pieces.  I thought falling into a K-hole sounded pretty great.  But then this week, I remembered Tera and her metaphorical fall.  How dark she said everything felt that night.  And how long--how totally endless every moment seemed.  How slow.  How boring.  And I realized that falling into a K-hole is probably exactly like being a receptionist.    Sorry.  Guest Relations Associate.  Never fear.  Never fear.  I have not turned to drugs and debauchery in my absence.  Though I needed both this week.    This is what happened.  Ready?  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  No auditions, no adventures.  No sex, no lies, no videotape.  Everything is just holding patterns.  Endless.  Boring.  My manager called.  She's used up all of my photos, and not  managed  to get me one appointment for Pilot Season.  Which is probably both her fault and mine.  Her company doesn't have enough clout to get me in the door....because casting directors aren't interested in meeting people my age who don't have any tv on their resumes....but I don't have any tv on my resume because, until now, I haven't had an agent or manager to GET me into any television auditions...and so on.  End result?  Nothing happening.  I went to a bar Thursday and met a red-headed version of The Guy I Always Meet.  The conversation was a variation on The Conversation I Always Have At Bars.  It starts out with, "What do you do?" or "Where do you live?" or "How long have you been in New York?"  And it's like trudging through a swamp.  I have no energy for these talks anymore.  The idea of sharing any part of myself with someone is terrifically unappealing.  Especially when so few people respond well to the parts I do share.  I don't want to listen to them tell me how noble it is that I'm following my dreams.  "Aim for the moon and, even if you fail, you'll still end up among the stars," they'll say and then tell me that they majored in business/law/economics because they didn't know what else to study and now they hate their job as a banker/lawyer/accountant.   And even as they're fessing up to the safety of their choices, I will see the knowing look that crosses their face at some point in the conversation:  Oh.  How cute.  An actress.   As if "actress" is a euphemism for "stupid," "misguided" and "poor."   Then I will turn the conversation to Other Things, and will listen to the tale of the trip this guy took to Turkey  ten years ago , or the great lengths he went to to find the t-shirt he's wearing.  Because he collects clothes by this designer.  Which are only sold in certain stores, apparently.  And would I like to go to dinner sometime?  (And, yes, these people do exist; I'm not imaginative enough to make them up.)  And do you think he'll even notice  when my head explodes ?    Next,  urlLink M's friend Idiot  called again.  The fact that he called may  seem  to contradict my original statement that nothing happened this week.  But, it doesn't.   Idiot called again even though--you'll remember--I told him in January that I couldn't talk to him or be his friend.  And, though I never returned his jaw-droppingly stupid "You look like Darryl Hannah" Phone Call, he still somehow thinks I'm just dying to talk to him.  Just suffering without him in my life to confide in.  Which should make me mad again, but doesn't.  Instead it just highlights another holding pattern.  The M Holding Pattern.  The fact that I am waiting--still--like a fish in a bowl, for a phone call from M.  An email from M.  An apology from M.  A reason.  An offering.  An effort.  From M, who I dated and loved.  AN EFFORT.  From M.   Not from his stupid fucking friend .    an effort.  At saying (I don't need him to want me back--wouldn't that be stupid for both of us.  I've no need to move backwards, just want to move ON) that he's sorry.  And he wants me to know it.  He's calling, in fact, to say that now.  To tell me how, in some small way, as he walks down his street...when he looks out his office window at the Brooklyn Bridge, maybe, or sits down to eat breakfast...he remembers--I don't know.  What.  What would I want it to be?  Something.  Some small thing.  And whenever he remembers it, he wishes good things for me.  Because I mattered to him.  And, anyway, he just wants to tell me that.    That I mattered.  Well.  Holding Pattern.  I don't know what I'm doing or when I should decide that what I want to do and what I can do may be two different things.  Walls are up--don't talk to me because I have no room for you or need for you and your issues and idiosyncrasies and your miles and miles of questions.  No room, most of all, for the pain you might cause.  Because, what would be the point?  I don't want to tell you my stories.  This day is long, long, long already and it's only 2:30, but that's what happens when you have a job you don't care about because it gives you the flexibility to aim for the moon and follow your dreams and live on a prayer, and don't talk to me in bumper stickers, you fucking condescending piece of shit.  You don't know about my talent or my intelligence.  I have not been in anything you might have seen recently.  I haven't been on a soap, or on a billboard.  Nor have I, apparently, been on your mind.  Though you are always on mine.  Circling here.  Like a large, black bird over the city.    Holding pattern.  K-hole.

      61. The first solo I ever sang in front of a lot of people was the song, "Let's Go Fly A Kite," which, I believe, is from  Mary Poppins .  People in my hometown still come up to me and sing it.  Nineteen years, people.  Let it go.  62. I think the first three minutes of Aaron Copland's  Appalachian Spring  are so beautiful they're almost hard to bear.  63. My karaoke song  is  "Hit Me With Your Best Shot."  But it  should be  "Pour Some Sugar On Me."  64. In college I was in a show with special guest star Debbie Gibson.  Ready for some irony?  She sang, "I Am The Greatest Star" from  Funny Girl  and forgot the words.  Five times.  At one point she got so frustrated she kicked off her shoes and started to try the song again.  And forgot the words again.  Finally someone screamed "Do the 'Electric Youth' Dance!".  Ms. Gibson ("Deborah" now, in her theatrical career) stormed off the stage.    65. This boy I dated at leadership camp one year made me a mix tape.  On the outside of the tape, on Side A, it said, "This is only the beginning" and then you flipped it over and Side B said, "Hopefully we'll never see the end."    66. I got myself cheap tickets to The New York Philharmonic this year which was one of the best things I've ever done for myself.  They played all the Beethoven Symphonies this season and at one of the concerts there was a blind man with a seeing-eye dog.  I was up at the very top of the hall, looking down at this black dog, sprawled out in the aisle on the orchestra-level.  Funny, strange thing.  To see a dog at the symphony.   67. I think "There'll be icicles, and birthday clothes and sometimes there'll be sorrow" is about  the  most concise summation of--well, pretty much everything that life is.  I heart Joni Mitchell.  68. I own one Britney Spears CD.  Oops.  69. When my roommate isn't home I blast "Dancing With Myself."  Billy.  Idol.  70. My first professional role was as a talking dog in a children's musical based on the tv show  urlLink "Reading Rainbow" .  I toured the US for six months and sang the "Reading Rainbow" theme song in front of more than 250,000 children.  For those who know what Reading Rainbow is, I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike here and tell you that Lavar Burton toured with us  in spirit only .

      So....  *she says looking down at her lap and scuffing her feet*  ...There's this party...  ...in March.  On the 2nd...  And it's for a good cause--to benefit this charter school in Brooklyn...or Queens...or somewhere...  ...and I think it might be really fun, so...  ...Should I go?  Oh.  And there's a 99.9% chance that M will be there.

      Well, here it is.  Valentine's Day.  blech.  For those of you in relationships, have fun calling each other using your special Verizon V-Day romantic ringtones.  Because nothing says "I care" like electronic beeping to the tune of Mya's "My Love is Like Whoa."  That Mya.  For those of you who, like me, may have spent the wee hours of Valentine's Day crouched in front of your toilet throwing up--whether from stomach flu or just general malaise--I would like to offer the following observations about relationships, love, and Valentine's Day.   So, without further ado, I bring you:   Relationships, Love and Valentine's Day As Seen From the Cool Porcelain Base of A Toilet While Throwing-Up Half-Digested Tortellini At Three AM    First of all, everyone who lives with me in Manhattan and is female and single gets a Super-Special Outstanding-Genius Princess of The Universe Forever Gold-Star Sticker because not only have we survived Valentine's Day (so far), but we have also survived FASHION WEEK.  And--to those of you who live outside of Manhattan--let me tell you, it is one thing to have V-Day come upon you when you're single and lonely, but it is  another thing entirely  to have V-Day come upon you when you're single and lonely and on the subway surrounded by eighteen-year-old models casually toting handbags that cost as much as mid-size off-road vehicles.    Sure, some of you kind male readers may interject at this point and say, "Whatever.  Guys don't like models.  They're too skinny and their hipbones jut out so far that it hurts to make out with them.  Yo."    Boys, I hate it when you lie.    Each day this week, I have seen the way men react to these gaggles of young women in their size zero designer jeans and their fresh four-hundred dollar messy-look haircuts.  Old, young, homeless--down to a MAN, you would file the jutting-hip-bone-pain under the heading, "Hurts So Good."    **  Last year for Valentine's Day, M gave me a Whitman's Chocolate Sampler.  The kind you get at the drug store.  He didn't even get the largest sized box.  Nor did he get the kind of Whitman's Sampler that comes in the heart-shaped box.  Because he waited so long to get me anything that by the time he got to the drug store the heart-shaped ones were sold out.    Anyone saying, "But it's the thought that counts" has just missed the point entirely.  He also gave me a card with an elephant on the front of it.  The elephant (huge. purple.) was asking, "What kind of Valentine are you?"    Hmmm.  There is nothing less wonderful than receiving a Valentine's Day card that--even for the briefest of moments--makes you think that your lover is suggesting that the answer to the question "What kind of Valentine are you?" is: Huge and Purple.  Like this elephant.  On the inside the card actually said, "Too cute."  (Relief.)  He signed it, "Happy V-Day." For anyone who thought he was going to sign it "Love," your optimism is annoying.  Go eat some glue.  **  Last night, as I was laying in bed feeling nauseous and disgusting and all hollowed-out, I thought, "Thank God I am single.  There is no one in the world, save my mother and my old pediatrician Dr. Ed, who I would want to see right now.  Also thank God I am single because now I get to sprawl out on my bed and moan a lot whenever I flop over, and kick around the covers as much as I want.  And I can continue to do so even when I'm starting to feel better.  Harumph."  Today, though, I wish I wasn't single--or at least that I had a hot date tonight--because having the stomach flu has temporarily made me super skinny, and I would like to show off.  **  This is a list of things that make a better gift than a medium-sized Whitman's Sampler in a square-shaped box:  A large-sized Whitman's Sampler in a heart-shaped box. Roses. Live blooms of any sort. Even geraniums. A McDonald's Happy Meal. Socks.  **  A boy who I have kissed before, cornered me on a stairwell in a bar two nights ago and kissed me again.  Yay!    Then he said, "How 'bout you touch my chest right now and I'll touch yours."  ...  ?  ?  ...  I thought I'd give it a moment and see if the right words would come.  Haven't.  **  But, nevertheless, I do think He's out there.  My Guy.  Who will Get me.  And who won't treat me like a bar wench (see above.)  Wait--do over.  He won't treat me like a bar wench unless we're alone and feeling fiesty.   ...  ...  I'm going to go eat some glue.

      51) My dorm room freshman year had a soporific effect on all who entered. It was known as "The Womb" partly for this reason, and partly because we had deep red curtains.  52) My First-Year Seminar Professor somehow made wearing one long parrot earring seem very hip.  Her peculiar accessory choice was one of the first things that made me understand that in New York City--unlike in Wisconsin--there would be more to shopping than just The Gap.  53) Junior Year I kissed a boy just to get him out of my room.  He was a math major and a distant relative of both Ulysses S. Grant and Daniel Boone.  He kissed like a math major.  Algebraic.  Points and Angles.  54) I went dancing by myself.  Not often, but more than once.  55) The Drunkest I've Ever Been: Junior Year.  I locked myself INTO my room (by leaving the key jammed into the lock on the outside of the door).  Because I was the Resident Advisor I couldn't call campus security.  So I scribbled "Help" on a piece of paper and slid it underneath the door when I heard people coming down the hallway.  I also called all of my friends and left them drunken "Send Help" phone messages that I think they recorded and will probably end up playing at my wedding.  56) I had a love/hate relationship with a homeless woman who lived near campus.  She would say, "Do you have any change?"  I would say, "Not today, sorry."  She would say, in all seriousness, "I'll take a check," and then hand me a pen.  57) My favorite thing to do on Saturdays was wake up and have an egg and cheese sandwich with my best friend, Emily.  The bagel place down the street stopped serving egg and cheese sandwiches on weekends at 4 PM.  Senior year I went a lot of weekends without getting up in time for an egg and cheese sandwich.  58) I couldn't have picked my "Groups and Symmetry" Professor out in a line-up, even while I was "taking" the class.  It was the class I chose to fulfill my math requirement.  Number of times I went?    5 ?  Whatever.  If I'd gone more than five times, I guess I'd know.  59) I spent entire afternoons crafting single paragraphs of my Senior Thesis on Oscar Wilde's  Salome .   My advisor stopped me on the street after I'd handed it in to say it was the best thesis she'd ever received.  I suck at anything that might actually make me a decent living, but I'm a  fuckin' demon  when it comes to writing long-winded papers on abstract, dramatic texts.    60) You know that nightmare you have where you haven't been to class all semester, and you've not done any of the reading, and the final is tomorrow so you had planned to stay up all night studying, but then you accidentally fall asleep, and wake up fifteen minutes before the exam starts?  Happened.

      41) The day I moved into my college dorm was the first day I had ever set foot on its campus.  I had been to New York City only once before my first day at college--for a weekend-long high school choir field trip where we performed at Bellevue and I saw a crazy man's penis and sang for an amputee ward.  In that order.  It says something about me that this bizarre experience did not deter me from moving to NYC for school.  I'm not sure what it says, but it definitely says something.  42) I had applied almost exclusively to schools with both prestigious music programs and strong academics.  I got into exactly none of those schools, and was devastated.  I ended up at Barnard as a last choice, thinking that going there meant that I would never become an opera singer.    43) I met the guy I'd lose my virginity to, Gustavo, on my second day at school.  We slept together for the first time about four days before my 18th birthday.  He was an extremely charming person, and an incredibly effective compulsive liar who went to elaborate lengths to construct a certain level of believability around every lie he told.  It took me and my friends and family about nine months to get to the bottom of all of his varied stories.  Among his most amazing stunts: Calling me from an airplane phone at home in Wisconsin over Christmas vacation, using a stolen credit card.  Stealing a labtop computer from a girl on my floor.  Giving me a bracelet packaged in a Tiffany's box and jewelry case...that was not from Tiffany's.  Stalking me for almost two years after we broke up.   44) Unlike other times in my life when I may or may not have appreciated my own good fortune, I feel 100% positive that I appreciated how fantastic college was every single day.  I found it bewildering (in a good way) that my single responsiblity was to read about complicated, vastly interesting things and then write and/or talk about them with (mostly) smart people.    45) My first voice teacher in New York talked about her nipples all of the time.  She had sung at The Met when she was about 19 years old.  She had an enormous potrait of herself in her living room and a slightly nutty son who accompanied all of her students in his boxer shorts.  She had probably had a fabulous voice at one time, but she--like many voice teachers--had no idea what made her voice fabulous and therefore made a not-so-great teacher.    46) She took me with her to sing at an opera festival in Germany the summer between my Freshman and Sophomore years.  The former-East German city we lived in brought to mind two words: concrete hive.  I left the city often, taking long train rides to Amsterdam with a girl named Serina who told me that her boyfriend had had a leather dominatrix outfit made for her.  47) When I got back from Germany, I auditioned for a new voice teacher at Juilliard whose student had heard me sing that summer.  She accepted me into her studio and so I ended up studying there for the remainder of college.  "Take that!" all you lesser-known conservatory programs that rejected me in high school. *she does small, brief victory dance*  48) Junior Year it was my New Year's Resolution to see a boy named Luis naked.  49) New Year's Resolution achieved by mid-February.  50) Seeing Luis naked pretty much defined the latter half of my college experience.  He listened to Edith Piaf on Saturday mornings.  For two years we had drama and great sex and 3:00 in the morning on his rooftop. When asked once, while sitting at our favorite bar, why he kept doing a funny (sexy) thing with his lower lip, he smiled and said, "I'm diverting my kisses."  He was a heartbreaker and a man-child who looked great in white t-shirts.   Even when it was terrible, it was wonderful.*  College.  *Rose-colored glasses?  On.

      31) For the first time, a boy who I liked, liked me.  We will attribute this miracle to contact lenses.  His name was Matt Tiettemahn.  On my fourteenth birthday he came strolling down the hallway toward my locker carrying a single rose.  Lame now, but--at the time--crushingly romantic.  32) Later that same night our dear Matt came to my house to surprise me...with a dozen roses.  My mom and dad and I are sitting in the living room, watching tv.  A knock at the door, and there he is, bouquet in hand like something out of a Molly Ringwald movie.  Only, a key romance-factor in those movies is that  the parents are never home  when the hot boy shows up at the door.  Having the parents be at home sitting with you on your couch, while Matt Tiettemahn fawns all over you, makes the whole situation very awkward.  And when Matt tries to get you to sit on his lap, it gets worse still.  And then, when someone (your mom, maybe?) suggests that you take Matt upstairs to show him the den (?), you feel relief but also an impending sense of dread.  Because to go from never having any boy even notice your existence, to having a cool, popular boy in your den holding birthday-surprise roses...well, it's a lot to handle.  33) First kiss: Matt's house to watch movies.  Unlike my parents who checked on us about every five seconds after sending us to the upstairs den, HIS parents sent us to the basement to "watch tv" and then promptly went on vacation to Florida.  Matt played " urlLink More Than Words" by Extreme  and read me a poem about footprints and sand.  Then he licked my face.  I remember standing there, and thinking, "That was it?"  And it was.  34) I also got my first and--I think, only--hickey that night.  I wore a forest-green turtleneck to school on Monday and showed my hickey to a few of my closest friends*.  I felt like The Luckiest, Coolest Girl Ever.  *Everyone.  35) I broke up with Matt after two weeks.  36) I went to Prom four times.  First time: fuchsia dress that looked like something I stole from the dressing room at a ballroom dancing competition.  Also, of course,  urlLink fuchsia dyeables.  Second time: strappy black dress with slits on both sides.  Sparkly beaded jacket.  Not bad.  Third time: A red dress that I thought looked like the one Julia Roberts wears in  Pretty Woman .  Didn't.  Fourth time: Mono + Long black dress + Pale white skin + Circles under eyes= Walking Death.   37) Singing competitions, voice lessons, performances, all the time.  38) Got drunk for the first time as a Freshman.  Alicia Bartline, whose father had money because he invented a machine that killed chickens, kept small bottles of airplane liquor in her closet.  Being friends with Alicia made me feel Bad.  39) At fifteen I went to a national speech and debate competition where I met a boy named Aron.  After sitting with him for one night at dinner, I said, "I could spend the rest of my life locked in a room with that person and be completely happy." I meant it.  We wrote letters and visited each other for nine years after we met.  Now we don't talk, and I'll never tell you why.  40) What teenage story would be complete without food issues.  In study hall my friend Amy and I chewed donuts and then spit them out, so as to get the taste but not the calories.  I also would go home after school and mix up batches and batches of cookie dough and then--without sampling even so much as one spoonful--I would take the batter outside and dump it in the bushes before my mom came home.  Then it made me feel powerful.  Now it makes me feel sick.

      21) During most of middle school my bangs were curled up into a very high, very hairspray-crusted shape that resembled a tsunami.  22) During most of middle school I wore enormous dark blue glasses, which I purchased because the woman at the glasses store said they made me look like I was wearing make-up.  23) Gullible.  24) Terrible at every sport.  Really--all of 'em.  25) I spent many a sleepover freezing the bra of one, Maggie Bogenreef.  26) Andrew Morter, who you may remember from a previous entry, was my "Secret Santa" in eighth grade.  I spent weeks shopping for the exact right Grateful Dead t-shirt to give him.  I finally found it.  On the day when I brought in my beautifully wrapped, perfect gift to give to Andrew, he had forgotten to bring something for me.  At lunchtime his mom came in and dropped off a gift.  Ponytail holders.    27) I experienced coolness for the first time at Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp.  Nicole LeGrande, my 17 year-old counselor with infinitely awesome permed hair, did my make-up for the camp dance and let me borrow her flourescent green shorts.    28) It was in gym class in seventh grade that I realized that Roman Ab Machines give me orgasms.  It is a medical mystery.  Any doctors reading this can feel free to speculate.  29) Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp also gave me the amazing experience of going to Europe to spend my summer singing.  At eleven.  And again at fourteen.  Without parents.  Both times.  30) When I was running for Secretary of Webster Transitional School's Student Council in 8th grade, I won the (coveted) position by performing the following rap to Axel-F:                                 My name is Kate and I'm coming to you                'Cause I need your vote, plain and true                I said, Brothers and Sisters, c'mon and see                 I'll be the best Secretary that'll ever be.                 Me, I'm responsible, tried and true,                 Creative and kind, thru and thru.                 I know my way around the Senate floor.                 I've been on a year, a half and more.                 Other qualities that I possess                 Include neat, caring and happiness.                 So you know it's covered when it's with me,                 And covered it will always be.                 So Yo! Vote Kate! Uh-huh! Groovy. (The majority of this still holds true.  The part about being "neat," however is not true. I was never neat. That was just something I said so that I'd win.)

      11) My mom used to cut my bangs by putting masking tape across them to make sure they were straight.   urlLink They were .  12) When I was six and had just started at a new elementary school, I asked the librarian, Mr. Simpson, if I could go to the bathroom.  He said, "No."  Being, as I was, unfamiliar with sarcasm, I promptly went to the back of the library and wet my pants.  13) Mr. Simpson ended up feeling very badly about this and let me hold his elephant booger (which may have been a real elephant booger, but was more likely a large ball of dried rubber cement).  14) Set up a "veterinary clinic" with my friend, Lori.  Our first patient was a (probably already dead) moth that we kept in a small jewelry box.    15) Used to bury things I found at the end of my driveway so that archaeologists could find them and learn about our society.  16)  I had a lot of outdoor, barn cats, many of which died outdoor cat deaths (run over).  I still have nightmares about sick cats.  17)  One of these outdoor cats gave me ringworm.  18)  Lied a lot.  Might still.  19)  I'm not baptized.      20)  Actually said, about Mark Hamill when I found out he was married, "All the good men are taken."  Age? Seven.

      1) When I was born on October 21, my parents say they almost named me Annabella Drizella because it rhymes with my last name.  2) I have already been stalked twice since moving to NYC.  So good luck convincing me to tell you my last name.  3) I grew up on a farm in Wisconsin, but we never actually farmed anything.  4) We had a goat named Long John Silver; he hung himself.  5) I got to name the two sheep we had.  I named them Daisy One and Daisy Two.  My creativity, I guess, kicked in post-sheep.  6) When I would get tired, but would want to keep playing  something , I would put my underwear on over my clothes and pretend to be Princess Leah in that scene from Return of the Jedi when she's chained to Jaba the Hut.  7) My imaginary best friends were named Shawna, Fauna, and Rabies.  8) When my mom used to drive my brother and I around, she'd be The Driving Droid and sometimes we could program her to take us wherever we wanted to go.  9) Despite this, I spent a lot of time waiting for my real mother to come and get me.  10) My real mother, of course, was Princess Di.

      Thank you, Boys, for your kind thoughts re: the denim.  The verdict is in:  If a little squishy-soft puppy with floppy, silly ears, put on a bunny costume with a fuzzy, poofey, teeny-tail, and skipped around wiggling his soft puff of a puppy-bunny, fluffy tail-bottom...  ...he would STILL not look as cute as I do in my new jeans.

      M's best friend just called me.  RAGE.  My skin may begin peeling back at any moment, falling to my office floor in scorched pieces.  Think: that scene where all the Nazi's die in _Raiders of the Lost Arc_.  You know the one I mean.  And if you don't, go stand over there with the rest of the slow children.  I have no time for you now.    I am too FURIOUS.  We will call M's friend "Idiot" because he is one.  My relationship with him, while I was dating M, could be described as follows: I was nice to him because he was M's friend.  My relationship with him, Post M: I used him for information.  Clear?  Since M and I broke up, Idiot has called often.  He is the kind of person who stays with you on the phone so long that your ear gets hot and you start worrying about brain cancer.  During the first two months after I found about M's cheating, I spoke on the phone with Idiot occasionally because I missed M.    Idiot reminded me of M.    I tried not to talk to Idiot about M.    Sometimes that worked.  But rarely.  As I gradually came out of my post-break-up stupor, I started to come to my senses and stopped  returning Idiot's calls.   Idiot is totally without tact, which made talking to him very painful.  Idiot is clueless when it comes to women, so his queries about the female condition are repetitive and remedial.  Idiot may or may not have a crush on me, which makes me uncomfortable and totally uninterested in continuing to speak with him.  Lastly, Idiot  KNEW THAT M WAS FUCKING KAREN, THE UNHOLY SLUTWHORE FROM HELL, AND DIDN'T TELL ME .  Though my anger regarding this last was late in coming to the party in my brain, when it arrived it was salivating and hairy-knuckled and it ate all of the other guests and then went on to tear the heads off of kittens and babies.  In other words, there are many things I want for Idiot.  Most of them have already been catalogued in great detail by The Marquis de Sade.  None of them include, "To be his bestest friend."  When he called in November, I did not pick up.  When he emailed, I did not respond.  Ditto: December.  Along comes January, and  you would think that the guy would get the picture already and leave me fucking ALONE .   You would also think that my reasons for ceasing to have contact with him would be rather apparent.  Those reasons being: I dated his best friend for eleven months.  I had no basis for being friends with Idiot other than that I was dating his best friend.  His best friend lied to me for a good part of that eleven month period and fucked a woman named Karen (known on these pages previously only as The Unholy Slutwhore From Hell).  Idiot knew this and didn't tell me.    You! Sam!  Michael!  Guys!  First of all: Do I look fat in these jeans?  Second of all: What about this situation is so mysterious to Idiot?  Well, if you're going to give me advice now, and if that advice is going to be something along the lines of, "Be straight with him.  Next time he calls, pick up the phone and tell him that you don't want him in your life.  Yo."  I did that.   Around the beginning of January, when I returned from Christmas to find multiple messages on my answering machine from Idiot, and when--that same afternoon--he called again.  Twice.  I finally picked up the phone to have a talk with him.  "Idiot," I said on that fateful afternoon, "I don't think I can be your friend.  It is too hard.  I am tempted to talk to you about M and that is not fair to you, and that is not fair to me.  And I think it is better if we don't talk anymore."  So Idiot responds, "You know M has a new girlfriend.  Or should I not tell you that?"  AR..un..ghh...I...rmm...trying...resist...re..si..st....  To my credit, I don't break out my poodle skirt and start twisting my phone cord around my finger while singing, "Tell me more.  Tell me more.  Was it love at first sight?"    Nor do I go all Sylvia Plath and start scraping a kitchen knife over my wrists.  (Yet.  I wasn't coordinated enough to hold the phone and scrape at the same time.)    But, we all know that I don't stop him.  "She's sweet," he begins.  Of course she is.  "He's--you know--a little rough around the edges and she has a really great way of handling that.  But, if it makes you feel any better, he went home for two weeks at Christmas and was worried because he didn't miss her.  So he's not sure that she's the one.  What do you think?  Do you think if he didn't miss her she's not 'It'?"  I stutter, "I don't think he can miss people."  Here it comes.  Wait for it.  Wait.  He's about to say  The Meanest Thing Ever Said .  "Sure he does.  He missed Karen."  ...  ...  He missed Karen.    Wow.  I still can't believe the Idiot would actually tell me that my ex-boyfriend.  Who I loved.  Missed.  MISSED.  The woman he fucked behind my back.  ...  ...  It dazzles the mind.  ...  ...  WELL, anyway, even I am not that sick and self-sacrificing.    "Look, Idiot," I respond, "That is exactly the type of thing that makes me not able to talk to you.  I don't want to know about M.  I don't.  I want to be happy and move on with my life and forget I ever knew him or you.  Good-bye."   And I hung up.  Since then, you have all been witness to my M detoxification.  I have, in effect, been blogging that man right out of my hair.    I've blogged out my concerns about M's New Girlfriend until, frankly, I've more or less stopped thinking about her.  And, I'm making progress with M as well.  I didn't, for example, respond to his pathetic "Thinking of you" text message in December (which he sent *she notes with a satisfied grin* while he was dating this new girl).   I have not called him.  Even while drunk in taxis late at night.  You should be impressed about this.  It's amazing.  It is, I believe,  a testament to my strength and ageless wisdom.  At least, that's what Nelson Mandella said when he wrote to congratulate me on the achievement.   So, WHY would Idiot call me--after ALL OF THAT--just weeks later--to tell me that...  ...he met Deryl Hannah.  And he thinks I look like her.  RAGE.  On so many levels.  Daryl Fucking Hannah?  RAGE.

      81.  Prior to being a Guest Relations Associate I had a (thankfully) brief career in retail, as a manager of a large clothing store in Manhattan specializing in designer items at a discount.  Meaning that all the customers were snobby enough to care that everything on their person--including their socks--was designer, but too cheap to buy any of it at full price.  After working there for several weeks, my hands were already cracking from having to touch so many metal hangers, and--despite the fact that they'd given me the rather fun task of decorating the store windows--I needed a day off.    SO, my Saturday shift came around and I decided to call in sick.  Unwilling to rely on the usual, "stomach flu" excuse, I racked my brain for something not too gross, but VERY contagious.  Voila: Pink. Eye.     But, here, guys and gals, is where  I take it to the next level .  When I returned to work the following day, I wore glasses, lined my eyes with pink eye shadow, AND SMEARED THEM WITH VASELINE so they'd look all shiny and infected.  Totally unnecessary.  A little scary.  But, also, kind of genius.    82. I can't fall asleep unless my ears are covered.  83. I went to a John Denver Concert.  By myself.  For fun.  Less than ten years ago.  84. I have never  actually  laughed at any joke involving "toilet humor."  I may have fake-laughed once or twice, but have never genuinely found anything about farting, etc. very funny.  85. My favorite smell is the smell of Lillies of the Valley.  Either that or the smell of the armpit of any man I'm in love with.  Tie.  86. I received The Best Free Thing Ever last week on Wednesday night when I went to a trendy film premier party and got a coupon for a  free pair of Lucky jeans .  Fuck.  Yeah.  Before that my Best Free Thing Ever Record was probably just the free box of Biore pore strips I got at Lillith Fair.  87.  urlLink Want one.   urlLink Want one.    urlLink Not so much.   88.  urlLink My absolute all-time favorite website .  A Dictionary is also, by the way, one of the three things I'd probably choose to have if stranded on a desert island.  Also a 100 color box of Crayons with that awesome, but useless crayon sharpener built into the back.  Also a magic carpet.  89.  urlLink Favorite flower.   Don't bother to send.  Have killed two already.  But, then again, if you really WANT to send, can send anyway.  Kitchen table is looking a bit bare.  90. Because I have too much time on my hands, and because I sit in front of a computer all day, I have been forced to do this.  I am now officially a cliche.  So:  urlLink Probably .   urlLink Probably not.  Unless, of course, I marry an ostrich.  In which case, I'd consider it kind of homage to his family .

      On  Ricki Lake  this afternoon guests will "debate the constitutionality of same-sex marriages."  I plan to be there for every.  Intellectually Stimulating.  Moment.  Therefore, this will be brief.  Let me say that I received an email on Sunday from the on-line dating service that I had formerly been part of, informing me that I was eligible to sign up for the service again AT NO COST.  I am normally not a sucker for such things, but--well, this weekend I was.  The Con-Artist Formerly Known As Unicorn Fiasco really threw me for a loop.   I was in need of a little love, a little hope.  A little joy.  Also, I just really want to be taken out to dinner.  AND since, when I go out in real life, no one talks to me.  Ever.  I figured I'd live dangerously and take advantage of my three free days of the wonder that is on-line dating.  Mistake.  Big one.  Obviously.  This morning, my email was filled with these:   Hey u--  Read your profile.  U r so cute.  Lol.  Think we might have some things in comon.  I luv travel, sports, and exploring the city.  They're is so much 2 see here.  Let me know if u wnat to see it with me.   Now, I think we bloggers all know each other well enough to be REALLY honest by now.  To be--for lack of a better phrase--blatantly fucking cunty.  So.   I MEAN, COME ON.    (And, as long as we're at it: You.  Over there on the left.  Mini-skirts are not for everybody.  Repeat after me, "Mini-skirts are not for everybody.")  My profile uses the word "magnanimous."  Not in a pretentious, uber-academic way, but--it's in there.  Nothing is misspelled.  As on-line profiles go, it's pretty outstanding.  And I get fifteen-plus variations on, "I'm way cool and into you pretty ladey"?  (Southern Belle Boob was trying to get me to write back to that one.  She is a sucker for anyone who tells her she's pretty.  Cheap hussy.)  And, on the other side of the spectrum, there was one guy who, aside from mentioning that he was Ivy-League educated about--let's see--once a SENTENCE, actually  told me his IQ.   Like this:   Greetings,  I am an Ivy-League educated, extremely successful bachelor, looking for a girl who can keep up with me intellectually (IQ 157).  I played squash and tennis for my Ivy-League University...    I know, I know.  I am being whiny and bitchy BUT I DON'T CARE!  I am a great catch.  I am smart and pretty.  I know the difference between "there" and "their" and "they're."  And  there  are a lot of total wackos in this city.  Really crazy people, who do all sorts of screwed up things!    British Boob:  Right-o!   Southern Belle Boob:  But, Honey, all I'm sayin' is, beggars can't be--   Shut-up.  *hits Southern Boob*  Shit! Ow!    British Boob:  Now, Now.  Tut, tut.   You too.  *hits British Boob*  Fuck!    erm....  What was I saying?  Oh.   um.  Never mind.  Anyway, I gave up my free days.  Not gonna use them.  Waste of time.  ...  I have to go watch  Ricki Lake  now.

      Someone from Moldova reads my blog.  I have been waiting my whole life to say that.  In other news, the ole'  urlLink Unicorn post from yesterday  has sure stirred up quite a frenzy.  I love you all for being incensed on my behalf.  Knowing that there are people in Moldova who care whether or not my boobs get touched, pretty much makes my life worth living.  My boobs are also thrilled to be internationally known and cared for.  In fact, they would like to say a few words:  Boob Left *with British accent*: Hullo.  Bully for us, I say.  Pip-pip.  Boob Right *Southern Belle*: We have always depended on the kindness of strangers.  I don't particularly care if any of you thought that was funny.  That little boob dialogue will pretty much keep me laughing for the rest of March.  Anyway, onto things that--while bigger--are certainly NOT better than my hilarious boobs.    As far as the Unicorn is concerned, seems many of you have some unanswered questions that I will now attempt to address.  The largest issue seems to be regarding U's relationship with this mysterious Smoking Girl.  Well, the answer to this quandry was provided by Emily herself last evening.  Time travel.  Back to U's last visit in October, 2003.  There was at that time, a small blemish on U's seemingly perfect record.  He sent me a brief email informing me of his impending visit.  The email began, "Dear Eva."  NOW, I say, "AHA!  Scoundrel!  Who is this Eva person?"  AT THAT TIME, having met female friends of U's on several occasions who he knew from school, and who were absolutely, undoubtedly just CHUMS and nothing more (I know this because they were around when we were making out and were--at all times--perfectly calm and friendly) I made fun of him for calling me Eva, and believed him when he said that he had cut and copied the email to a bunch of his friends to save time and let everyone know when he'd be around.    He apologised.  He came to visit.  Insert: fun montage of us drinking and laughing and then making out all over Manhattan.    And no Eva appeared on that evening or any other.  OR SO I THOUGHT.  Because  (dun-dun-dun- DUN ) last night Emily, who is a Super Sleuthing Best Friend Extraordinary Private Eye Genius, called with Big News.   Turns out,  Em, who had stayed with the group after I left, had  actually spoken to Smoker Girl at some point later in the evening  (Em is so clever and tricky).   At that time, SG took the cigarette out of her lips long enough to reveal to Emily...   ...that she was Eva!!    Smoker Girl =  Eva!  I know!!!  Right?  It's like finding out the identity of the second shooter on the grassy knoll.  HUGE.  Boob Left *British*: Quite important, really.  Quite.  Boob Right *Southern*:  Sweetheart, you could knock me over with a feather.  He seemed like such a nice boy.  So that, Ladies and Gentlemen, is all we know.  Because after revealing her identity, Smoker Girl Eva put her cigarette back in her mouth and returned to smoky silence.  Well.    Though this information raises other questions that will likely remain unanswered, it does give us a bit of insight into the destruction of this particular Unicorn.  As to why in hell The Con-Artist Formerly Known as Unicorn would've called me, that question was answered by TCAFKAU's friend J :  *Standing in line to get into second bar of the evening*  "It's great to see you again, J,"  I say, huddling with him and Emily under our umbrella.  "Yeah, I totally wanted to hang out.   That's why I told Unicorn to call you. "  ...  ...  Sometimes my life is so like an Unrequited-Love Molly Ringwald Teen-80's Movie that I can barely control myself from rushing home to my house on The Wrong Side of the Tracks, to start drawing sketches of the prom dress I'm going to sew myself.  I mean.  Really.  Oh, and, lastly, as for Emily's whereabouts after my departure.  Let's just say I received the following text message from her at 3:44 a.m.:  //    Love.    //  And that is all I'm going to say about that.

      Unicorn is my booty call from California who comes to NYC several times a year to visit friends.  He is called Unicorn because, prior to meeting him, I believed such men were mythical.  Here is a short list of the mythical qualities he actually exhibits:    1)  Unicorn is handsome.  2)  Well-educated.  3)  Thoughtful.  Leaves the occasional adorable phone message.  Sends the occasional adorable email.    4)  U is the friend of a friend from college.  This means that I can make out with him without having to worry that he's a psycho killer who is in fact just posing as a great guy so that he can get close to me, kill me and then use my hair to make a himself a sweater.  Which I guess is faulty logic (except the part about the hair-sweater, that makes perfect sense.)  Obviously, he very well  could  be a psycho killer and still be friends with my friend from college.    But then that would mean that he's an Excellently Secret Psycho Killer who is so efficient that none of his friends even suspect his psychotic murderous tendencies.    Meaning that he is very good at what he does.    Which I find sexy.    So we're fine.  5)  Unicorn is emotionally and physically giving.  He is familiar with the terms "snuggle" and "cuddle."  And he knows when to do them.   6)  U has a way of making me feel rather special.  Like I am more than just a transcontinental booty call.  Case in point: he says things like, "If I lived here, I would date the hell out of you."  I like the sound of that.  7)  U is charming.  Exhibit A: He visited for the first time the day after Valentine's Day last year when I was still dating M.  He said the following in regard to the fact that M and I were not together the night after Valentine's Day, "If I was dating you, I'm pretty sure I'd want the whole weekend."  See what I mean?  Unicorn.  This is our pattern: he emails me.  He calls me.  He comes out to visit.  We make out.  He goes back to California.  He emails me.  Calls.  Comes out to visit.  Etc.  Six month cycle. Which I suppose adds to his general Unicorn-ness as well: seeing him is rare, brief and always exciting.  So when Unicorn phoned yesterday to say that he was on his way into New York, and would love to see me, I immediately did the following:  1.  Let out a small, celebratory scream. 2.  Blasted New Order's  Bizarre Love Triangle  and danced around my office. 3.  Felt real sorrow over the fact that I have not seen  urlLink Bella  recently.   4.  Considered making appointment with non-Bella bikini waxer at nearby salon, but then rejected that idea due to fear that Russian mafia would put a hit out on me. 5.  Rushed home to find hot Victoria's Secret underwear scrunched up in back of drawer and blow dust off of it.  Sure, U hadn't responded since I'd last emailed him, but it is only fair to point out that in all my years of writing letters to Santa Claus, the Jolly Fat Guy has never written back ONCE.  So I feel as though mythical people must just run on a slightly different schedule.  Or have a hard time accessing email, magical glades being what they are.  Bottom line: mythical creatures deserve some slack.   In any case, I was looking forward to an evening with my Unicorn, his two friends P and J, and my best friend, Emily.  Tonight, I thought--for real this time--I will surely be kissed.  So you can imagine my surprise when I entered the bar and saw two Model-Like Women seated at the table with The Boys.   Huh.  Fancy that.  And then I get a reception from Unicorn that is akin to the greeting you'd receive from a rather overzealous ex-babysitter.  Brief.  Semi-awkward.  Huh.   Wait a minute  I'm thinking.   Our hugs are not brief and semi-awkward.  This is my Unicorn.  Our hugs are warm and long and filled with the promise of a night that will last until five or six a.m.   Clearly, something is amiss.  Then, simultaneously, Two Horrible Things happen.    I am ushered into a seat in a corner that is as far away as possible from where U is sitting--a seat that is   even on the same side of the table as he is , so there will not even be an opportunity to make use of the only weapon at my disposal at this point: The Full-On Flirtatious Glance/ Meaningful Half-Smile Combo.  AND...  ...one of the Model-Like Women begins speaking Italian.  God.  They're multilingual.    This is worse than I thought.  As soon as I am settled in the corner, Unicorn's friends, P and J, begin to enthusiastically welcome me.    Unicorn?  Not so much.    I make chipper small-talk, and text-message Emily to apprise her of the situation:           //Come quick.  Pretty girls.  Am threatened.  Help.//  While waiting for her response, I begin to feel out the Model-Like Woman nearest me.    Her name is Sylvie.  (Of course her name is Sylvie.  Model-Like Women always have names like Sylvie.)   After only a few moments I am able to discern the following things about this Sylvie person: she is very drunk and very skinny.  These things I can handle.    However, then I find out that she is the most frightening type of all Model-Like Women--Quirky.  Think Holly Golightly meets Zelda Fitzgerald.  Within the first few seconds of our conversation, she has already begun peeling the labels off of my beer bottle and playfully lifting up her skirt to stick them on her thighs and arms.  She crinkles her nose often.  Add to this her penchant for breaking up her adorably accented English with long strings of excited Italian.  Top that off with her super-cute flapper-esque short haircut.  And finally, complete the image by punctuating her sentences with occasional drunken hiccups.  Translation: every man at the table wanted her to have his baby.    Text message received from Emily:                   //On bridge.  Be there in a sec.  How pretty?//  Immediate reply:                   //Tres.  Multilingual.//  Emily writes back:                   //FUCK.  Am conjugating French verbs in prep.//  (This is why Emily is my best friend.)  Unicorn has still not spoken to me, which prompts me to write Emily again, just so she is fully prepared for the gravity of the situation:         //Am in corner.  Like Baby.  Sans Patrick Swayze.//  Meanwhile, P and J are happily quizzing me on everything that has happened since we last saw one another.  "You were just about to start on-line dating last time we hung out.  How'd that go," says J.  "That's right!" says P.    Then, A Small Miracle.  "That's so funny.  That's how Sylvie and I met," P continues.  YES!    Yes, yes, yes!  Yes!    Sylvie and P are dating.  U has not been put under her bobbed-hair, Italian-speaking spell.  Relief.  One Model-Like Woman down.  One to go.  I offer up my best on-line dating horror stories while checking out the Model-Like Woman sitting next to U.  Personality?  Too far away to tell.  Possibly silent, heavy-smoking type.  Hmmm.  As bars in NYC are now smoke-free, is difficult to assess.  Several minutes of observation later, Far Away Model-Like Woman has still not opened her mouth.  Smiles often, though.  Finally--Ah-ha!--leaves to smoke.   Am happy.  Pegged it--silent, heavy smoker, indeed.  Now can move over to speak with Unic--  Unicorn follows her out.  Oh.    It is serious then.  Being from California, Unicorn has an aversion to smoking, and yet...there he goes.  To be with the smoker.  To stand with her outside in the rain.  As she smokes and smiles in Model-Like silence. My heart sinks.  This is bad.  As the night wears on, I am not even given the opportunity to put up a good fight.  Unicorn is fully and completely occupied with Smoker Girl.  They sit together, stand together, smoke together, drink together, and so on.  I speak to Unicorn only once, as the group is deciding which bar to head to next.  I offer up my suggestion--a place only one block away with good music.  Unicorn acknowledges my contribution...  ...and promptly turns to SG to offer the suggestion to her.  It.  Is.  So.  Not.  Fair.  Who is this mysterious Smoker Girl?  How did they meet?  Why is she so irritatingly silent?  And, most critically, why did she have to go after MY Unicorn?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why? WHY?  Forgive me for stomping my foot like a petulant child but, *she stomps petulantly* this blows.    I wish the story ended differently (you have no idea, trust me), but...I ended up leaving.    I normally reject games entirely, but, for the sake of putting my Good Vicki's Secret to some use, I would've stayed if he had established that he was just trying to make me jealous.  I can flirt and play games with the best of 'em.  (Plus, I actually speak, so I'm pretty sure I'm even better at flirting than The Smoker Girl.)  But U clearly wasn't playing a game.  He really wasn't acknowledging me.  At all.  Which is not fun or sexy.  And certainly not in keeping with The Unicorn Code of Conduct.  In fact, I'm pretty sure that Real Unicorns are deathly allergic to Model-Like Women.  Even the Quirky Ones.  And especially the Smokers.    In any case, as it became clear that the people in our group were going to pair off, leaving me as The Odd (But Still Sexy) Woman Out, I knew it was time to depart.  And so...  In the cab ride home, I was sad and annoyed and buzzed and horny, and far too aware that my pretty underwear was now just a lacy reminder of the fact that I had anticipated a very different ending for this night.  Huh. Unicorn.    Too bad.    Turns out, they don't exist after all.

      To the person who found my blog while searching for, "cruel female torture of having nether holes fucked by horse"....um.  Hey.  Welcome.  Today's topic will be children's theater.  So.  Maybe tomorrow.  ANYway.  I am never going to hire a clown for a child's birthday party.  You shouldn't either.  Though ten months of touring the country as a performer of children's theater doesn't qualify me as a clown  per se , it gets me damn close.  Puts me, I would say, on the  cusp  of clown-dom.  Clownishness.  Whatever.  Anyway, I'm closer than most people I know.  And that means I understand on a personal level that all people whose job it is to dress up in really stupid outfits and entertain other people's children are a few zippities short of a doo-dah.  No exceptions.  Having recently been attending parties which require me to "mingle," I have been badgered rather often into revealing details about my past.    Here in NYC you meet a lot of people who do pretty much the same thing: lots of bankers, lots of lawyers, lots of advertising people, marketers, publishers, etc.  Their jobs are awesome as far as I'm concerned--they actually make money.  But, their careers do not necessarily yield much in the way of "entertaining party stories."  So when it is  my  turn to say what   I  do, people get all interested.  And then, when they ask the inevitable, "Have I seen you in anything?" (annoying) and I say, "Not unless you have children," they get all giddy.    Gi-ddy.  "You did children's theater?  Oh, that's so  sweet .  John, she did children's theater.  Isn't that just the  sweetest thing ?"  "I did two tours," I will say, "First I went out with a musical called  Reading Rainbow  based on the tv show with Lavar Burton.  Then I did a musical based on  The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe .  I played The White Witch."  "I loved those books.  C.S. Lewis, right?  And  Reading Rainbow !  Did you get to sing that great theme song?" my companions will ask.  "How'd that song go?" another one of them will chime in.  "Will you sing it for us?" a third one will say, excitedly.  "No!" I will snap.  It is at this point that the back of my neck will start to tingle.  "Oh, come on!" they'll continue, beginning to sing it now themselves, " Butterfly in the sky... ."  "STOP IT!" I will say too loudly.    They'll sense the desperation in my voice.  "Don't," I'll say, calmed down by their alarmed looks. "Don't sing it.  Sorry.  But don't.  It's a horrible song.  I sang it 285 times.  I hate it.  Don't sing it."  This is when the trouble starts.  Even two years after my last stint as The White Witch in the musical version of  The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe , I still cannot talk about the experience without feeling myself lapse just the tiniest bit back into the Dr. Pepper-addicted, truck-driving, Motel 6-inhabiting, rash-covered, sweatpant-wearing, child-hating LUNATIC that I was then.    "Tell us everything about it.  Gosh, how  interesting !  Were the children just the  most  adorable?  Their enthusiasm!  And introducing them to the theater!"  What the party-goers would like to hear at this point is a sunny tale of rosy-cheeked toddlers whose first theater-going experience involved me skipping around stage a la Julie Andrews.  Sans rash.  What the party-goers would NOT like to hear is that, during our week of performances in New Orleans, our Aslan, the play's noble lion/Christ-figure,  ran off the stage at least once every performance to vomit in a trashcan because he was DRUNK .  For example.  But, truth be told, there was a rash-less, vomit-free happy day somewhere amongst the ten months of touring.    I believe it was a Monday.  I believe it was the first day of the job.  If memory serves, I finished the show, walked off stage, and said to the bluebird who had just landed on my shoulder, "I am the luckiest person in the whole world.  I get paid to play pretend.  I get paid to make children laugh.  Oh, joy.  Oh, rapture!"  End Scene.  For the benefit of these nice people, then--who, I understand, are really just trying to make conversation--I will recount it.  Especially the part about feeling like the luckiest person alive.  They eat that part up.    "Gosh," my rapt party-audience will say, "you must love children."   At this point, the back of my neck will start to burn and I'll begin to taste peanuts.  My mind will flash back to a day near the end of tour.   To a certain Denny's in Ohio.  To a particular slice of peanut butter pie.  I will remember it like it was yesterday.  I recall gasping for air, struggling to form words while sobbing.  I see distinctly the tears that plopped, shining, onto the surface of my pie.   We have to get her out of here,  I hear someone say in my memory.  I cry harder, shoveling down larger mouthfuls of salty-wet, gooey dessert.  "I just wanted to eat my pie.  Without them here," I remember gasping pathetically.  "Why'd they have to come here? I just wanted to eat pie."      The cause of my complete breakdown?    I was seated too near a children's birthday party.    Really.    I look into the eyes of my party companions.  I am tempted to tell them about this haunting peanut memory--fucking children and their fucking laughter, I am tempted to say.    But, I reign myself in (I can do that now, it's been two years).  Instead, I make up something bright and cheery about how I hugged kids outside the stage door right before every performance.  What they'll never know is that, in reality, my pre-show ritual went something like this:  Insane Domineering  urlLink Grimace-Shaped   Stage Manager Mimi: So, is everybody ready to have a good time?  Me, standing backstage in a huge polka-dot dress *quietly, under my breath*: Don't fucking do it.  Don't do it, Mimi.  I asked you not to do it!  2,000 Screaming Children: Yeah!!    Me *still quietly*: Mimi.  Come on Mimi.  They said, "Yeah!"  Leave it at that.  Come on.  You promised.  IDG-SSM: That didn't sound very excited to me.  Let's try that again.  Is everybody ready to have a good time?  Me: *gasp*  2,000 Screaming Children: Yeah!!!!!  AAAAhh!!!!!  Yeeee!!!!!  Yayyyy!!!!!!  YeEEEEEEeeees!!!   Me: *shouting now*:  I asked you not to do it!  Mimi!  Bitch!  Fucking Mimi! I'll fucking fuck your shit up!  I know where you sleep!  You know I do!  It drove me crazy, all of their cheery noise.  I'm being totally serious.  I did that show something like 285 times almost EVERY DAY for six months.  And by show number 78 or so, that yelling ritual thing Mimi did at the beginning of  every single show ...it ENRAGED me.  Around show number 179 it actually made me weep.    The kids would be screaming in their seats for the show to start.  Tears would be streaming down my face.  The music would begin; my cue to clop--in my grey Aerosole ugly costume shoes--out onto the stage.  Wiping snot from my nose with the sleeve of my huge blue and white polka-dot dress, I would sit in an enormous purple plastic chair.  In the dark.  Still crying, waiting for the spotlight.  Children tittering in their seats.    The spotlight would come on.    I could see the demons in the audience now.  A fat kid in the front row would be standing on his head, legs shooting up from his red-velvet seat.  His teacher would be leaning over to him, whispering loudly that he should sit "like a good boy."  Sniffling, miserable, I would begin:  Butterfly *snuffle* in the sky....   A question from one of the party-goers in NYC brings me back to the present.  "Tell us more. It sounds so wonderful!"  ....TO BE CONTINUED

      These are some things that have happened to me lately, during the period that we will now refer to forever as The Dark Time.  1.  Taxes.     Since many of you guys aren't American and, therefore, have gotten out of dealing with US Gov't Tax Forms  (LUCKY!), I will attempt to recreate their magic...right...HERE.    Start with a number.  Any number, really.  If you're poor, like me, it should be a pretty small number.  No more than five digits; REMEMBER, this number represents your income.    Put that number on a sheet of paper, and draw a little box around it.  In the corner of the little box, make a teeny-tiny Number One.    Now, take a ruler, and divide the rest of the paper into seventeen-thousand-twenty-five other boxes.    Next to each box, write something utterly nonsensical, but official-seeming.  Like, "Part-year city of New York resident tax on capital gain portion of lump-sum distributions created by the sale of dairy products between the hours of five and seven p.m. on days of the month divisible by five."    Now, this next part is  very  important.    Next to each utterly nonsensical, but official-seeming thing you have written, you must also add AT LEAST ONE, and possibly all, of the following.  a) The phrase "(See instructions)".  However,  do not under any circumstances  write any sort of page number following this phrase.  Do not even indicate  which  set of instructions you might be referring to.  Let the average US Citizen think that you mean some unknown page of the US Individual Income Tax Instruction Book.  They will, of course, be wrong, but it is crucial that you keep them in the dark.  In reality, you can be referring to  any  instruction manual--the instruction manual for your microwave oven, the directions for the toy you just bought your infant son, that little pamphlet that comes with tampons.  Whatever.  It doesn't matter; the goal is confusion.  Look toward the goal.    b) Something like this: "If the amount on this line is  less than  the amount on line 456.6b, divide both numbers by the square root of your age as of July 19, 1984, and enter that amount here.  If the amount on this line is  greater  than the amount on line 3446.75d, take this form and hold it up in front of a mirror.  Write down the backwards versions of all of the numbers you can see in the mirror on a small sheet of yellow paper.  Wait until the next lunar eclipse.  Then eat the yellow paper, counting the number of times you have to chew the paper in order to swallow it.  Enter that number here."  c) Something like: "(Refer to Form HDTV-STD-53, tables I, III, or XIIIIIIIV.  Also refer to a copy of your older sibling's Form EZ-1040.  Notice how much more money he/she makes than you.  Feel badly.  Finally, refer to page 163 of any novel on the lowest shelf of your bookcase.)"  I hope all of you non-US Citizens can now be a bit more understanding about America's plan to take over the world.  We're just grumpy and confused about our taxes.    2.  I feel it is important to add here that the amount of money I made this year is so small that it's actually ha-ha funny.    3.  A small man knocked on my (new) office door Wednesday morning and RETURNED THREE LARGE BAGS OF GARBAGE.  To me.  Apparently, he was dissatisfied with the garbage we had thrown out, and was confusing me with The Garbage Return Center.  As in, "M'am, I bought these three large bags of garbage earlier this week, and, I'm sorry, but they're just not smelly enough.  I had wanted real smelly, egg shells and cheese-rinds garbage.  These are mostly just sesame Thai noodles and soda-drenched newspaper.  They won't do."  Apparently, he was unhappy because the people who have been working at this office for months and months and months and months.  And months.  Those people, have not been recycling.  And so, as a result, this disgruntled man had reached his non-separated garbage limit and, had come to demand that someone  PICK THROUGH THESE THREE SMELLY BAGS OF GARBAGE  and separate out the recyclables.    Guess who got to do it?  Guess.  I dare you.  I love being The New Girl.  4.  But, just when I was feeling like a toothless, grimy patched-jacket-wearing  HOBO , and was ready to pick up my bandana-tied-to-a-stick napsack and point my floppy shoes West, my friend called and invited me to his law school's formal.  And with every piece of garbage I picked, I spoke the following mantra:  Tonight.  I.  Will.  Once.  Again. Feel. Pretty.  5.  At this formal I was having a fine time meeting lawyers, and future lawyers and the lawyers of the lawyers of lawyers past.  And their girlfriends.  Most of these girlfriends are from out of town, and so I am playing a fun game, in which I compare the girlfriends to the girls their boyfriends fuck on the weekends when the girlfriends are NOT in town.  (May I add that the girlfriends win hands down.  Hands.  Down.)  So we're all karaoke-ing and having our portraits drawn and all of the other things that you do at these dances, which are kind of like carnivals for grown-ups.  With lots of alchohol.  And, late into the evening, lots of wine-spills and vomit.  Not classy, but kind of fun.    And just when talking about law is getting kind of old, and watching law students stumble around and throw-up has lost its charm, I walk past a table, and see that...  ...out of all the people at this huge event that I could've known...  ...the person  I  know....  ...is the woman dressed up as a crazy gypsy giving Tarot card readings.    She's in my acting class.    I am thrilled to see her.  She gives me two extra-long readings and we talk for an hour, pissing off all of the drunken law school students in line, which causes us no small amount of joy.   Because by that time, I'm sick of being lawyerly and having conversations about summer internships that I pretend are interesting.  By that time, I'm ready to hang with the gypsies.

      Thank you all for your comments and your emails.  Such an overwhelming surge of love and concern has not been felt since the "We Are the World" video of 1985.  I am mystified by this phenomenon--all of these strangers walking around in my head, picking things up and commenting on my taste in dishware.  Kind of.  It's all very flattering, and interesting, and a bit...well, disconcerting when people make judgements or, even worse, throw out insults.  (Ahem.  Certain letters of the alphabet falling between W and Y.  Ahem.)   What is a better image, really, to convey what happens in this odd, online world, is the idea of walking along a street at night and looking into people's windows.  You see a couple sitting in their kitchen, and they're holding hands, maybe.  Or maybe they are moving back and forth across their room, arguing, while you stand on the street for a moment to watch.  You judge them based on that moment because it's all you know of their lives.  It's an image that is caught, temporary.  Also partial.   They're so unhappy  you think.   Or  They're so in love .  They might be both, or neither.  Everything you know of them has taken place in the frame of a window, in the slim space between two curtains.  I think we all see where I'm going with this.    As for your 17 (!!) comments on the March 2nd post, it has occurred to me that I should pretend to have instigated a Super Secret Grander Plan: TO FOOL YOU ALL INTO THINKING I'D GONE AWAY, JUST SO I COULD TOP THE PREVIOUS COMMENT RECORD OF 13.  But, I'm bad at pretending when it comes to Super Secret Plans.  Really, I just had a lot on my mind and was moved to play Guest Relations Associate at a new location, where I work with a man who has  absolutely no  sense of other people's personal space, who weirds me out so much that I need to leave the office frequently to get away from him, and then end up walking around Soho and spending money on strappy summer sandals that I have no use for.  Instead of writing my blog.  Perhaps the Real Super Secret Grander Plan should involve me finding a new job....   In any case, as you will see below, I have not been neglecting you or my writing, I've just been having trouble pinning my feelings down.  I needed to get things in motion, so that I could get the fuck over this M Thing already and get my groove back.  As it were.  So enjoy these posts, which I've entered in the order in which they happened in real time, so you can get caught up.  Tomorrow, I shall tell you more.  Promise.    Unless the weird man stands too close to me again, in which case, I'll just buy more shoes.

      From February 7:   I am close to getting M out of my system.  Lest you get overly excited, let me remind you that "out of my system" is different than "out of my heart," and is in another universe entirely from "out of my mind."    So, what exactly is the significance, then, of "Out of my system?" you might ask.   To which I might reply, "Fuck off."  Let's just say that "out of my system" feels like progress.  And what REALLY feels like progress is the fact that  I don't have M's phone number memorized, yet I STILL deleted it from my cell phone on Wednesday .  Even better yet is the fact that The Moment of Deletion wasn't really that big of a deal.  I didn't burn incense or read Audre Lorde poems or anything.  I was just buzzed and standing in front of the Pottery Barn on Houston, and I turned to my best friend and whipped out my phone...  ...and read her the numbers so she could program them into HER phone...  ...and then deleted them from MY phone.     So maybe this moment didn't exactly have the total conviction of a Thelma-and-Louise drive over the cliff, but I am what I am.    POINT IS, I still look awesome in my new jeans.  AND, I'm getting over him.  There are, however, little irksome tidbits and memories that keep skittering around in the corners.  Bothersome, bothersome.  They ruin my peace of mind and need to be dealt with.  Herein lies the problem.  Since I have been A Number-One Superhero Genius and have not spoken to or contacted M since Halloween, and since M is A Sucky Coward, my guess is that I will never speak to him again.  Which means, that, unless I find some way of getting all of these unspoken worries/madnesses/rantings/wishes out of my head they will remain there indefinitely, nibbling away at my sanity and causing me to end up like some tortured, lovelorn combination of Camille Claudel, Judy Garland and Eponine from  Les Miserables .    Which, actually sounds terribly dramatic and painful in a glamorous "my-life-is-difficult-but-yet-still-chockful-of-a-ridiculous-number-of-extravagent-parties-and-lovely-designer-shoes" kind of way.  Plus I get to die in the rain, singing in M's arms:    I cough.  The gunshot wound from the battle on The Barricades is throbbing.  "You've never looked so lovely," he says.  I touch his face.  People pass us.  "Amazing shoes," one stranger says as he walks by.  I smile, still gracious in my weakened state.  "God you're so beautiful," M says, "You were always so beautiful.  I cheated because I was afraid of your beauty.  And your intelligence.  And your deep and profound goodness."  "Yes," I say softly, beatifically, "I know. *cough* It doesn't matter now."  "It doesn't?" he asks, sobbing, "Then you forgive me?"  "No," I smile, close to death now, "But the Angel that just came down to tell me it's time to die, also told me that your future wife is going to despise you, use you for your money and then leave you penniless and miserable after a horrible divorce."  Then I bleed all over him, ruining his favorite U2 t-shirt, and am promptly whisked off to Heaven where I am reincarnated and returned to Earth as a Nobel-Prize winning supermodel.     Sigh.  ANYway, where was I?  Oh, yes.  Bothersome.  Needing to get some things off my chest.    But what to do.... What to do.

      From February 26:  Ok.  Let's just get this out of the way.  I did it; it's done.  After four months of being an Extraordinary Strong Wondergirl Valedictorian Beauty-Queen Genius who DID NOT HAVE ANY CONTACT WHATSOEVER with her ex-boyfriend, I gave in.    I emailed him.  Whew.  Ok.  First let's cover what this effort at contacting him was  not .  It was not motivated by alcohol.  It was not motivated by late-night loneliness.  It was NOT a heartfelt epic poem that relied heavily on flower imagery or similes that compared my still-lingering love to an eternal flame.  There was, in fact, no reference to love, still-lingering or otherwise.  No flames.  Nor was it hate-mail.    Nor was there ever even an urge to make it hate-mail.     Really.  So that's the easy part: What it wasn't.  Check.  Now we get to the harder part.  What it WAS.  Well, this is what it SAID, "Hey M--  I'm going with a friend to a story slam tonight, and was thinking about you.  Wondered if you ever got up to tell one of your stories?  Tonight's topic is "stranded."  When the topic is "children's theater," I wil be unstoppable.  Would be good to hear from you, K."  I will  totally own  that the whole "going with a friend" thing was an unnecessary and blatant attempt at making him wonder whether or not I and this "friend" are currently engaging in hours and hours of carnal lovemaking, during which I frequently yell things like "You're so much better in bed than my last boyfriend!!!!".  Fine.  I admit it.  Sue me.    The rest will take me some time to figure out.  Which I'm going to do right now.  With my friend, this huge martini.

      From March 6:  Well.  I talked to M today for five hours.  It's out.  There it is.  Everyone ok?  Someone get Maddie some water.  She looks pale.  I was going to make a list of all of the the things I feel right now, but it started to look like a page out of a Thesaurus.  For every word I listed, I also listed its opposite: satisfied/dissatisfied.  Happy/unhappy.  Immersed/distant.    It's hard to describe...well, really  anything  about this.    The inside of my head is like a swimming pool after a really windy Fall.

      What's bad is that I've been drinking a lot lately.    What's good is that I think that my drinking has destroyed only a small group of brain cells.  You know, the ones that make it impossible for you to set your clock ten minutes fast so that you get up early?  The ones that--when your alarm goes off at 8:00 even though the time is  actually  7:50--say, "Don't get up now!  Remember, you set your clock ten minutes fast yesterday.  It's  actually  7:50.  You still have ten minutes of sleep.  Idiot."  (And, really, if you're me, you still have  sixteen  minutes of sleep because we all now know I won't get up until 8:06 under any circumstances.)    Well, anyway, where was I?  Oh.  Those.  My drinking a lot lately has killed  those  brain cells.  I know this for certain because, for the past several weeks, I have been buying a chocolate heart every day at lunch and putting it in my pocket in hopes that I will forget about it and remember it later when I have a craving for something sweet.   "This is silly," I have said each day as I put the chocolate in my pocket.  "I will totally be eating this chocolate in about ten seconds.  This piece of chocolate won't even make it to the lobby elevator.  Dumb plan.  Like I'm really going to forget that this yummy chocolate is in my pocket."  And then...  ...I promptly  forget about the piece of chocolate in my pocket until hours later when I have a craving for something sweet and suddenly remember that there's a piece of yummy chocolate in my pocket .     I was actually mildly amused by this new trick of mine because it reminds me of the game we play with my dad's dog, Frankie.  You know that game.  The one where you pretend to throw his ball, but don't really throw it, and just laugh when he runs around like crazy looking for his ball, and then looks all confused when he turns around and you're  still holding the ball in your hand .  Silly Frankie.  It's cute when he does it.  And I kind of thought it was cute when I did my own version of it with this new, great chocolate trick.  My alcohol-addled brain had turned me into my very own chocolate lab, and that kind of made me happy.    I'm just being honest.  But then today the trick worked again.    TWICE.    I bought the chocolate, forgot about the chocolate, had a craving for the chocolate, remembered the chocolate, ate it.... ... and then forgot I had eaten it .... ...had another craving for chocolate... ...remembered the chocolate  that I still thought I HAD IN MY POCKET ...  ...went to my pocket to get it... ...and realized I'd eaten it already.  And now I'm just sad.    And an alcoholic.  And a chocoholic.    And, apparently, quite stupid.

      A jumble of things:  His name is S.  That's all you get.  S has a red blanket that is the softest, reddest blanket I've ever felt.  It is only a matter of time before this red blanket belongs to me.  We should all be clear about this.  When he walked into the restaurant last night I actually felt a flip.  A shock.  Something great.  Like the view from the top of the ferris wheel.  I've known him for seven days, and he's already made me dessert four times.    When he heard me sing for the first time his eyes got all kid-at-Christmas big.  My mom thinks he sounds like he's got a good head on his shoulders.  Isn't that such a mom thing to say?  Moms are great.  My mom has a good head on her shoulders.  I have told him that roughly three hundred people around the world are very excited that I met someone wonderful.  I think he thinks I have way too many imaginary friends.

      What is it with you men.  Since most of you have been reading for awhile, there's no need for me to remind you that it has been a long, lonely North Pole-caliber winter.  I mean, we can be honest here.  I don't know about you, but for me the real low point was  urlLink when I got in a fight with my own breasts.   Which were starting to speak to me in various dialects.  That was bad.  It was a cry for help.  An odd (yet still, obviously, endearing and hot) cry for help.  In any case, we can all agree that when the only thing happening south of your neck, is that your boobs are having imaginary conversations with you in accented English, it is fair to say you've hit a low.  And it is also fair to say that the cast of male characters we've encountered during our adventures here in NYC has been entirely useless when it came to helping us get out of this slump.  They have resisted  urlLink The Fantastic Charlize Theron Make-Up Phase I went through  in January.  They've done nothing to aid my attempts to hook up with them meaninglessly ( urlLink Unicorn , that means you).  And the rest of the men I happen to have encountered in the recent past have proven themselves to be dishonest (M), or otherwise crazy.  SO that is why I find it fucking hilarious that, now that I've met someone and have no interest in meeting anyone else,  every straight man in Manhattan suddenly wants to date me .  You know those shots in music videos where the hot star singer is walking down the street and all the men she passes stop, turn, take off their shades and shake their heads in a sort of mystified-at-how-hot-she-is way?  I am now The Hot Star Singer.   Subway platforms are like nightclubs lately.  I'm not kidding.  I'm actually nervous to go to the grocery store because I think there might be some sort of riot.  Additional evidence: While getting my hair colored the other day, with my head covered in yellow glop and aluminum foil, and my neck bent at an awkward angle above a sink, one of the other (straight, cute) stylists actually made a beeline over to me to say, "You're really beautiful by the way.  When you came in it was just...it was like *makes popping noise accompanied by little flashy hand gesture*.  I couldn't take my eyes off of you."  What.  Is.  Going.   ON?    Boys.  You're so weird.  Why are you weird like this?  Explain.

      Remember how, in high school, kissing was still an  event ?    You could go to a movie (which was really, you both knew, just an excuse to sit together in a dark room for a couple of hours and think about kissing).  You could come over to his house to  watch  a movie (which was really, you both knew, just an excuse to sit together in a dark room for a couple of hours and kiss).  You could go to a party (which was just an excuse to kiss in front of other people).  You could drive (which meant, pretty much, just park somewhere and kiss).  Or you could walk (stroll, think about kissing, find yourself up against a wall or a tree somewhere, kissing).  Kissing is an event again.  On par with The Superbowl.

      The only thing that could be even better than looking forward to a second date on Wednesday...   ...is not being able to wait 'til Wednesday to have a second date.  To that end, I will be sneaking out of work today at 3:30 so that he and I can take a subway ride together.  And the only thing better than that, is that it's now 1:30 and my heart is already racing a little.  And if it gets better than that, then it'll be just gross.   Yes, Folks.  I'm now  that  girl.  Wait a minute.     YAY!  *does dance featuring a high kick and a "Walk Like An Egyptian" hand gesture* I'm now  that  girl.

      Not Edward.  Not Woody.  He's made a couple of films, but I'm going to keep his identity secret-- he doesn't know about you guys yet, and I don't want to raise his suspicions when he finds out that there was a huge, unexplained spike in rentals of his movies  the day he started dating me.   Besides, it's not about that, anyway.  What it  is  about is:  The fact that I've had a silly grin on my face since about the moment he sat next to me on the subway, till....let's see...yep, it's still there.  Meeting him in front of The Plaza Hotel and strolling through Central Park, with the trees and the sun and the trees and the sun.  The whole impossible scene of it.  Minus cherubs.   At eleven this morning he called to say that he woke up with still so many questions about me that we hadn't answered last night.  To which I responded, "It's a good thing the world didn't end then, so we still have some time to cover things."   So we shall see what we shall see.    On Wednesday, for date number two.

      This is what has happened so far:  It's Spring in New York, and last night I was feeling absolutely lovely.  New Marc Jacob's dress (peach and very feminine).  Bright, bright City.    But even so, I wasn't sure I wanted to go out.  For a good half hour, I thought I would just stay around my neighborhood.  Take a walk.  Call the people whose parties I was supposed to go to and say "Too tired."    But the new dress  is  gorgeous.  So.  Half an hour later, on my way into the City, I was running very late.  At 14th Street I got off the Local to transfer to the Q Express.  I waited and waited, but no trains came on the Express.  Until, finally, a Q arrived, but came by way of the local track.  Trains in New York are often traveling on different tracks, so I thought nothing of it, and boarded.  That's when it happened.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a man sit next to me.  I knew instantly who it was.  No names (yet), but he wrote and directed and acted in a movie that I have LOVED for years.  The kind of movie that I've seen half a dozen times, and still consider renting, because the characters are quirky and odd and smart.  Because I'd want them to be my friends--they could even  be  me.  But, I wasn't star struck.  I wouldn't have said anything to him at all.  Would've just told Emily about it later because she knows the film, and knows I adore it.  Only then I saw that the train was, in fact, running local.   Meaning that I would be even later for my friend's show than I had anticipated.  "Shit," I said.  "Why did you say shit?"  he said.  And I promise to tell you the rest of the story.   If our date tonight goes well.

      "Yeah, he got really burned by some girl once.  In college, I guess.  So now he's pretty cautious about women in general."  "That's so stupid," I start to say, and then stop.  Because.   In the dream I had last night , I was at a company picnic--maybe a baseball game--that was sponsored by the bank M works for.  I was there with a girl in my acting class who is a former model, and who has all of the personality quirks and carelessness of someone who has been paid only because she's beautiful.    She was holding my hand, walking around the bleachers with me when suddenly M arrived with a new girlfriend.    I was Trying Not To Look.  So, of course, I was looking.  What I saw came like images from one of those photo booths in train stations.  First frame: His arm around her shoulders.  Second frame: Her head in his lap.  Third frame: Fourth frame.    He was surrounded by his work colleagues, some of whom I'd met, some of whom he would never introduce me to.  All these men in suits, and M and this woman in the midst of them lounging on one another in a way that was simultaneously affectionate and cold (a dream thing, I guess).  After awhile, I felt I had to go over.  We had seen each other, and there were people who I had known when we dated...  ...so I put on my most congenial smile (think Southern hostess at the top of her game)...  ...and went over.  M didn't say anything at first.  The man next to him--a suit-clad business man who is probably just someone who I saw once on the subway or something--did all of the talking initially.  M always said I was charming, and I wanted so much to prove that while talking to this stranger.  But every joke I made, every smile I flashed, just met disdain and disapproval.  Meanwhile, M just sat back, watching.  His face was so clear in my dream, which was painful, because I don't really remember what he looks like in real life.  I don't have any pictures, and my memories (thankfully) have faded to leave just impressions of a certain way he had of smiling or turning his head--but the images aren't clear, really.  Just tracing paper and peripheral vision.    In my dream, though, every detail was laser-precise.  The sharp, definite lines of his cheeks and his forehead, all the planes and angles that I thought had been pushed underneath and away, came up to the surface now like shark fins.  It had been such a long time since I'd seen his face.   She  started talking then.    She was plain and wearing a long skirt--which he loves.  She was obviously on the attack.  Right away she launched into a story about how they'd met. She'd gone to Harvard Law School and Yale Medical School.  Both. (That sure says something about my subconcious.)  They'd met in a parking lot or something--she made him tell the story, which he did, speaking now for the first time.  How he'd driven by her and turned around, taken by something about her.  He spoke to me as though I weren't even there.  Literally.  Almost the way a blind person would look, with their gaze ever so slightly misdirected and out of focus.  It was like he barely remembered me; I was a woman he'd passed once in an elevator, or stood in line with at a store.  Meanwhile, he was so  clear  to me.  And I tried very hard to listen and to smile, but I felt so overwhelmed.  I felt love for him, but also so much sadness.  And then this tremendous ANGER.  She interrupted him suddenly and turned to me.  My anger--this overwhelming weight of it--was practically breaking out of me now.  She started to ask me all of these questions about my background and my life, making it so clear that I was foolish to her.   All the while she exchanged glances with the other strange businessman while M--silent again--just watched.  I stood up then, sick of the pretense, and starting screaming.  God.  Screaming and crying and so much horrible anger.  To all three of them:  How dare you ask me that.  You just want to know so that you can decide that you're better than me.  How dare you.     How dare you.  How dare you.  I could write it a thousand times and it would never be enough.   What It All Means   That clearly I have bizarre inferiority complex about Ivy League Universities.  That, though I am moving forward, I cannot ignore the fact that I am a different person now.  In many ways.  Some good.    And bad.

      Things people have emailed about that I'll address:  1) I'm not a gay man.  I sometimes wish I were, but that's another entry.    2) There was a link to one of my headshots here before, and for anybody who read this between about 4:30 and 9:30 EST, you most likely clicked on it and now know what I look like.    But, then I got an email that confirmed what I was already thinking on the subway on my way home which is, that it's more fun for me to have you all  imagine  what I look like.  So I reconsidered.  Too bad for you.   Besides, I didn't want any weirdos wacking off to my photo in their dingy bedrooms later.  Or Photo-Shopping my head onto the body of some woman enduring  urlLink the cruel female torture of having her nether holes fucked by a horse ...for example.  (There you go, Sir.  Thanks for reading.)  3) I didn't misspell "Below"; I  meant  to call this blog  urlLink "Bellow" .  Also, having never heard a bull, I guess I mostly meant Definition Number 2.  4) I think it's pretty much gonna continue to be "90 Things.  Re: Moi."  unless I get inspired in the near future.  So everyone chill out.  And, to be fair, you'll notice that "consistency" and "follow through" were nowhere to be seen on the list.    5) I love all the people who send me nice emails.  I think you're mostly just my mom using various pseudonyms, but it still makes my day.

      It is not the cab driver's fault...  ...that when he recommended we take the West Side Highway, it ended up taking  us ten extra minutes to even  get over  to where the Highway begins...  ...and when he said he'd take the Brooklyn Bridge, and  I said  that the Manhattan Bridge would be better, he   couldn't really  have predicted that--when he took the Brooklyn Bridge anyway--there'd be a flat tire...   ...and an accident...  ...and a closed lane.  Sometimes, life is just like that.  Traffic is unpredictable.  So, when I got all pissy and said,  I've lived in Brooklyn for two years, and it's never cost me this much to get home before ,  it was really pretty unnecessary.  In fact, it was pretty much the equivalent of yelling at a receptionist when it's actually her boss that you want to murder.  My driver couldn't have known.    He didn't blow out their tire.    Or close that lane.    What he did do was say,  Sorry my prediction was wrong .    But I was so mad by then that I grumbled the whole way and barely tipped him a dollar.    Though I realize he had no way of knowing that, though the honking was driving me crazy, my real anger lay with someone else.    Someone who--after weeks of absence--had written this morning...  ...an email to say he had thought of me.  And the smoothest, quickest cab ride in the world wouldn't have assuaged my anger.    So I got mad at the cab driver instead.    The two of us in a car.    Hitting unexpected obstacles just where we thought the way was going to be easy.  Sometimes,   I guess,   life is just like that.

      This is a very important thing that people should understand:  The person who answers the phone at an office most likely makes the least amount of money.  As such, they are also a) least willing to go out of their way to assist you and b) least able to help you with anything important.    Their job is to CONNECT YOU WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN THE OFFICE WHO CAN ACTUALLY GIVE YOU THE ANSWERS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.  The lesson, then, is this:  Being mean to the person who answers the phone is not only a waste of time, but it is cruel.  It can, I think, be equated with taunting the handicapped.  There is a special circle of hell reserved for people who do such things.  There is an even more special circle of hell reserved for the man who was just so mean that he made this particular Guest Relations Associate cry.

      You're all going to think I'm on-line dating obsessed.   I am not on-line dating obsessed.  I swear it.  Promise.  HOWEVER.  What I  was  again today was bored at work.  And, thinking back on a conversation I recently had with my dear brother, I remembered a particular on-line dating site that he had mentioned which is known for its complex and scientific methods of match-making.  Again: not obsessed.  BORED.    So I went to this site and spent a very long time filling out the pages and pages of information about myself.  For free, mind you.  I'm not paying for any of this crap ever again.    So the test goes like this:  Which four words would my friends most likely use to describe me?  (I said something like, "Articulate," "Creative," "Intelligent," and "Funny.")  Take the following four adjectives and tell us which best describes you and which least describes you: 1) Neat  2) Controlling 3) Open-minded 4) Passionate, etc., etc.  (For those who are curious: Most = "Passionate", least = "Neat.")  Kind of like a really narcissistic version of the SAT.  Anyway, I found out I'm pretty awesome.  That's right.  And I was feeling kind of good about it.  Hopeful.  I mean, an on-line dating website told me I am awesome, and that made me feel pretty damn optimistic.   Until I asked the On-Line Dating Website Brain to start searching for men who would be compatible for me.  Men, say, within NYC.  And the On-Line Dating Website Brain thought about it for awhile...  ...went out to have a cigarette...  ...came back...  ...thought about it some more.    And then told me it couldn't find me anybody.   But , the On-Line Dating Website brain told me, I shouldn't be discouraged.  This site only matched people who were truly compatible in the most important senses of the word, meaning that there was just nobody FOR THE MOMENT.  Not forever.  Fine.    Fine. *shrugs*   But , I told the On-Line Dating Website Brain, I would just like to have a little hope here.  So, I asked it, how about, instead of just looking in the NYC-area, you go and take a look in my region.  You know--in the Eastern part of the United States.  So, the OLDWB went back to its big file cabinet in the sky and looked around a little.  And made some calls.  Had a few more cigs.  And finally got back to me.    Once again, no luck.  Huh.    How 'bout that.  Maybe it's broken.  Well, not to be discouraged, I once again adjusted the range of my search.  I mean, come on. *laughs a little crazily* This is love--a soul mate we're looking for here.  Ravishing, overwhelming, chaotic, wonderful LOVE.  On an internet dating site, yes.  But still.  STILL.  There must at least be  someone  that the internet dating site can find for me.   I mean, that's what internet dating sites fucking DO .  *calms down*  So, I asked the Clearly Less Smart Than I Had Previously Thought On-Line Dating Website Brain to leave no stone unturned, and look IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA for just one stinking person with whom I might be compatible.  The stupid thing gave me nothing.  Seriously.  Zip.    And, I'm trying to be a optimistic here, Folks, but I'm a little concerned.    I mean, they don't fire people for throwing computers out of office windows, do they?

      I have this thing about black tie events.    Apparently someone, somewhere, once sprinkled some eye of newt over a sequined Jessica McClintock dress while simultaneously drinking the blood of a chicken and chanting my name. (A big shout out to all the devil-worshippers doing Google searches this morning who just found themselves here at Bellow.  Welcome!  Enjoy!  Please leave quickly!)  Because,  both  of the  urlLink Wishful Clothes Shopping  evening gowns I own have now hung in my closet alone and untouched for so long that I'm pretty sure they're using my vibrator.    However, The Terrible Black-Tie Curse may have finally been lifted!    *A high-pitched beaded cheer emerges from deep within my closet*   Who, you ask, do we have to thank for this miraculous turn of events?   A young man named David, who is currently  kicking the ass  of his competitor S in the "Invitation to Black Tie Affair" Category of The Competition That Neither of Them Knows They're Entered In And That I Just Decided To Start Right Now.    Other event categories in which David is delivering gold-medal caliber performances:  The "I Pull Out Chairs and Help Kathryn Into Her Jacket, Not Because I'm Making Special Efforts To SEEM Like A Gentleman, But Because I Was Raised In the South and That's Just What Real Men Do" Event.  (Southern Belle Boob--who has not yet been formally introduced to David--is  beside  herself).  It should be noted that S has decided not even to enter this event.  He's too busy  insisting that I not smile at him while he's eating, because it reminds him of his father .  More results to follow.  Though I think we're already seeing a clear winner.

      I have three--count 'em, three--female friends who have actually come during intercourse.    One of them came once.  One time.  With one guy.  Who was never able to make her come again.  She now wears black mostly and cries a lot.  One of them has come several different times with several different partners, and has absolutely no idea what differentiates the times when she  is  able to orgasm from the times when she is not. I have encouraged her to do extensive research on the topic for the good of all womankind, urging her to consider such variables as day of the month (Odd? Even?), local traffic patterns (What was happening, for example, on the GW Bridge?) and any route changes in the flights of various migratory birds (Where was the Speckled Tinamou? The White-collared Swift?).     I think  these are all points that are well worth considering. I think, in fact, that there is potential for Nobel-Prize caliber research here, if only my friend would commit to the necessary hours of investigation.   She  stubbornly insists on keeping her day job.  Boo.  The last friend is a Lucky Fucking Bitch who comes whenever she has sex: "I can't explain it.  I just come all the time.  It's like the guy I'm with can just look at me and--WHOOSH--multiple orgasms.  Sometimes like, gosh.  Like, five or six?  And I'm all, 'Stop it!  Stop it!  Enough orgasms already!'"    Whenever I'm around this mysteriously blessed friend, I have the urge to rub her belly (for luck), or draw her blood (um...for medical testing).    Anyway, all of this has made me aware of  a rather interesting discrepancy .  Whenever I have The Conversation About Sex that I have had with pretty much every boy I have ever dated or slept with, The Conversation goes something like this:  Boy: Yeah, every woman I've ever been with has come during sex.    Me:  Really?  Every one?  Boy:  Yeah.  Some have come like three or four times.  Me:  Three or four times?  Really.  Wow.  Boy:  Definitely.  I find this peculiar because...though I attended an all-women's college where we practically had entire classes devoted to frank discussion about our sex lives...though my circle of friends is 98% female...AND THOUGH many of my friends have slept with at least enough men to warrant the use of fingers AND toes when tallying...the conversation I have with the vast majority of my  female  friends and acquaintances in regards to sex, goes like this:  Me: I've never come during sex.  Them: Yeah, me neither.  Me: Have you ever had multiple orgasms?  Them:  Yeah. Sure. That time I fucked a Yeti.  Hmmmm.  Clearly, men and women are not communicating effectively on this topic.    *Collective Gasp*  Who knew.  Though I would usually blame this problem entirely on The Boys (and, mostly, in fact, just specifically on M), in this case I have to be fair.  This problem is the fault of both The Boys AND...the WWF Wrestling Smackdown.  I think the problem is fairly self-evident.  We're faking it, and you believe us.    For any Boys who argue that this is somehow the fault of The Girls for faking it in the first place, here is a short list of other fake things that you don't seem to mind so much:  Lara Croft.  I rest my case.  Need more?    Fine.    Consider things from our perspective.   Girl is making out with Boy.  Boy is all excited and sweaty and cute like Boys get.  Boy is asking, "Are you close?"  Girl thinks,  "Nowhere near.  I'm definitely not going to be able to.  It's a Wednesday, and it's raining too loud."     Girl considers telling this to Boy, but then flashes to an image of:   *Boy with his head in his hands after watching "His Team" in the Eastern Conference Finals*    "We fucking HAD 'em.  We were playing so well.  Fuck, Man.  We HAD 'em.  And then we fuckin' missed the free throw.  I mean....  Fuck.  FUCK.  I can't eat.  I'm too bummed.  Man.  This blows."   Girl recalls the Entire Weekend of Sulkiness and Dejection that ensued.  Right.   Girl rethinks her strategy and says only, "Baby, that feels so good."   A few minutes pass.  Boy asks again, "Are you gonna come for me?"  Girl sees brief mental image of pigs flying.  Suppresses a giggle.  Considers sharing the joke with Boy.    Girl thinks,  "Is it really that big of a deal?  I mean, does it  really  matter to him?  After all, as far as intercourse goes, whether I come or not really has very little to with his skills or abilities."     Girl opens her mouth to tell him as much, but--just in time--Girl remembers:   *Boy doing Gleeful, Butt-Shaking Victory Dance, accompanied by Aggressive Pointing*    "You suck!  You suck!  And you, Sir, suck!  I am awesome! Boo-Ya! Yeah!  Who's the all-time X-Box Madden Football Champion?  Who rocks the X-Box?  That's right!  That's! Right!  I'M THE FUCKIN' MAN!"   Duly noted.  Girl says instead, "Yes, Baby.  I'm almost there."  Girl then worries,  "But will he know I'm faking it?"   Flash to:   Boy's facial expressions veering sharply towards joy as he screams, "Give him the Piledriver!  Piledrive Him!  Yes!!! ...Awesome!" while watching The Undertaker take on Macho Man Randy Savage.   Flash to:   "Man, the guy at the karaoke place said I sounded just like Bon Jovi."   Flash to:   "Happy Valentine's Day!  Cute, right?  The purple elephant on the front reminded me of you.  Like it?"   Flash to:   "No way.  Her boobs are REAL."   Hmmm.    Girl knows what she must do.  She clears her throat to obtain maximum Steamy Phone-Sex Voice volume, gathers her wits about her, and begins to do her best impersonation of a peroxided blonde whose name is, "Tyffanii--that's with two "i's" and a "y" (*Giggle*)."  Afterward, Boy, beaming, gloats, "You really came hard, huh?"  Girl, slyly, reaching for her vibrator: "MMMMmmm.  Uh-huh.  Like three or four times."  Boy replies, "Whoa."  Boy thinks, "Boo-yah."   Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnd scene.  So.  There.  The truth is out.    And if you want to know how to  really  make us come, I can say only this:    Speckled Tinamou, Boys.    Either that, or buy her a  urlLink Roman Ab Machine .

      Hear that?     Hear what, Kathryn?   That.   We don't know what you're talking about.  Remember?  We don't live with you.  We're your internet friends.   Oh.  Well, then I'll be more specific.    It's the beautiful silence that comes from NO LONGER HAVING TO LISTEN TO ANY MORE CRUISE SHIP ENTERTAINERS WARBLE OUT BAD RENDITIONS OF "I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU."   I had a great time, truly, but I had to get that off of my chest.  My tan chest.  Southern Belle Boob looks fabulous.  British Boob too, though a little less so, as he tended to be shaded by the book I was reading.  Oh well.  Things I learned while away:  The urge to travel to distant places and buy t-shirts that say things like,  "I've lost the hair, but I've still got the huge dick:  Cozumel, Mexico"   is perhaps the most mysterious of all of mankind's many, many mysterious urges.   Ditto to white teenage girls getting their hair braided with those colored plastic beads a la Bo Derek in that movie that is like the only movie I think Bo Derek ever made.  The one where she's in that gold swimsuit looking all hot and exotic and awesome in her plastic-colored-bead hair THAT NO ONE ELSE EVER LOOKS GOOD IN OR HAS EVER LOOKED GOOD IN SINCE TIME BEGAN.     Everything tastes better served in a pineapple.   Pretty much all of popular music can be divided in two categories:  Karaoke Songs That Rock  and  Karaoke Songs That People Should Just Stop Singing Now And Never Sing Again Or I Will Find Them And Cut Them, And I Mean It For Real So Don't Fuck With Me On This . Songs in the former category include pretty much any song that gives the karaok-ier ample time for air guitar and drunken jumping.  Songs in the latter category include any song in which Celine Dion talks about her heart.    At a certain age, all men must be required to buy a braided leather belt.  A braided leather belt, to a man over forty-five, is, it seems, the  only  kind of belt worth having.     There is such a thing as "too tan."   If aliens ever come to Earth, and we can't figure out how to talk to them, and we're all just standing around in a big circle around their ship feeling all awkward, and strange, like there's so much to say, but we just don't know how...  ...someone should probably just start doing The Electric Slide.  I'm fairly certain the aliens will join in.

      Au revoir!    As a Christmas present, my family all got tickets to a cruise.    My huge floppy Kentucky-Derby, "I'm ready for my close-up now" sun hat is packed.  I've already heard my dad say the word "snorkel" for the first time in his sixty-two-year existence.  My vegan brother is bringing along an entire suitcase full of organic nuts.  I'm sure it will be a...time.  Tend to the farm while I'm away.    You are all excellent advice givers, and I shall send you virtual sand dollars and sea shells upon my return.  Also a virtual cabana boy (or girl.  Or both.) for each of you.

      OK.  As many of you pointed out, you need context in order to offer good advice.    I'm  supposed  to be doing laundry right now, but I am a Good-Hearted Loves-to-Share-Stories-With-Her-Brilliant-Internet-Friends Blog-Writing Angel (who also happens to hate doing laundry), so I will give you some context.    Last week on...  Saturday: Some stuff went down between us that needed to be talked about.  Sunday: I brought it up.  Also wondered aloud whether he might want to "table us" for a few weeks while he dealt with some particularly stressful work things.  Sunday con't: Tabling idea went over reeeeeeeally badly.  He said (in a very cold voice) that he'd think about it and get back to me.  Sunday con't more: Tried to think about  why  tabling idea was so misunderstood.  Came up with genius thought that he might be insecure and may have thought that  I  wanted to table us--which I didn't--I wrote an e-mail that began:  "I don't want to table us."  This e-mail then went on to explain why I had brought it up.  Thought email would surely get some response.  Anticipated further discussion.   One More on Sunday and then we'll move on to Monday.  Promise.: No email from S.  No phone call from S.  Nothing.  Monday Morning (told you I'd get there): Left him morning message on answering machine, specifically so he would know that I was still interested in talking with him, and that I still was interested in him.  Monday con't:  No email from S.  No return phone call from S.  Nothing.  Until....I received the e-mail that I posted here.  Tuesday: His call.  His emails.  Our talk.    BUT, before I continue to tell you guys anything else that has happened, I just need some information from all of  you.  Got that?  I require mega reader participation.  Of a kind not yet seen on this website.  I want feedback.  Got that people.  FEEDBACK.  That comment box better be brimming with the wisdom of people from 'round the globe.  Moldava Reader, this means you!  Okay.   DID ANYONE READ THE E-MAIL I POSTED THAT S WROTE AND ACTUALLY THINK THAT HE  WASN'T  BREAKING UP WITH ME ????     Anyone?   DID ANYONE READ THAT E-MAIL AND THINK WHAT HE ACTUALLY MEANT WHEN HE SAID "I don't think this is going to work for either of us" WAS, IN FACT, "CALL ME.  I WANT THIS TO WORK"???   Because that's what he said that e-mail meant.  Yeah.  I'm skeptical too.  SO, did my skepticism stop me from going over to his house yesterday afternoon to lie around on his big white summer bed, and talk about our earliest memories?   No.  Obviously.  BUT, am I taking this muuuuuch slower, and keeping my good head firmly on my shoulders?  Totally.  AND, did I just put on make-up in order to go get my afternoon latte from the adorable hot musician-boy who works at the coffee place on the corner?  The one who got so nervous yesterday when I came in that he took my money and forgot to give me my coffee?    Abso-fuckin-lutely.

      I wrote this on Tuesday afternoon, preparing to give you guys a blow-by-blow account of what happened:  Ideally, I would like to create some sort of Powerpoint Presentation to further assist us in the reconstruction and analysis of The Events That Occurred Between April 17 and May 3, a time which will from now on be remembered as  The Time of: What the Fuck  Was  It?  I Don't Know--Poke It Again.   However, I'm too confused and shocked, and just don't generally have the patience for all the graphs and pie-charts that would be necessary.   So no nifty pie-charts unless someone wants to step up and volunteer to help.  Instead, here is a list of things we should gather that may help us in our analysis:  Many, Many Tequilla Shots All of S's Movies (Which, obviously I'll have to provide, since no one else knows what they are.) Tarot Cards At least one person who speaks fluent Male. Much Kleenex.  The kind with the lotion so my nose doesn't get red. More Tequilla Shots.  We still don't have enough. Nope.  More still. And, wait.  OH, I almost forgot.  Right.   A MIND-READER .  *end post that I wrote Tuesday*  Because  just as I was about to continue writing the post I got, a call from S .  Then an e-mail from S.  Then another e-mail.  Then I called him back.  Then we got together and talked in Union Square for three hours.   And now.    Now I don't know what is happening.   I feel like I'm in whatever grade I was in when I took trigonometry.  Third, probably.  Sounds right.  Anyway, I feel like I did then.  Like I'm staring at this test covered with numbers and slashes and x's and obviously I know so little about trigonometry that I can't even write about it intelligently, which, I guess is kind of perfect, because that is exactly how confused I am.  I'd say Love is weird, but this isn't Love.  Not nearly.  Not yet.  It's more like Like.  Extreme Like....   With Potential.    Well, Extreme Like With Potential is weird.

      This is how I feel about it:  The setting is one of those scenes in a sci-fi movie.    We are all members of a small farm community in the Midwest.  Don't worry, we all look AMAZING in overalls.  In the midst of our day of plowing and hanging out at the post office, something strange has happened.  Rolling black clouds have appeared out of nowhere.  The sky turns dark as pitch.  A streak of fire sears through the air...  ...and  something  plummets toward earth...  ...landing smack-dab in the middle of Main Street.  Landon *moving toward the glowing object*: Fuck me!  Did you guys  see  that?  Holy Fuck!  Etoile: Wow...fuck!  What...?  What was that?  Susan: Is everyone OK?  Is anyone hurt?  Everybody?      British Boob: Steady men!  Steady!  Leticia: Hello?  Steady PEOPLE.  God, move into the 21st Century already!  You're so sexist sometimes.  Soon we are all huddled in a circle, peering cautiously down at the strange intruder.  Me: What is it?  Brittle-Lemon: Huh.  I can't say what it  is , but I sure know what it  looks like .  Me:  Yeah.  God.  It looks like--How weird...  I mean, it really does resemble...  *We all begin to share confused looks*  Sam: I know what you're thinking.    Etoile:  Right?    *Our shared astonishment continues*  Me: But, it  can't  be....  Can it?  Frankenblog: No way.  No fucking way.  Smoove D:  It couldn't be.  Kitten:  That's what  I'm  saying.  There is just absolutely and totally, completely NO WAY.  Jonny B: Nope.  I think it is.  Mike Tender: Me too, Man.  E-Man:  I'm with Mike and Jonny.    Me:  Huh.  Sam:  Huh.  Brittle Lemon: Huh.  Everyone:  HUH.  *Five minutes of SILENCE as we all stand around shaking our heads*  Me *bewildered* :   It's an e-mail.    All of us *stunned* :  Huh.

       Kathryn,  You're an excellent person and I've truly enjoyed spending time with you.  It seems we're in very different places in our lives and that's not gonna work for either of us. I'm sorry about that.  The future will bring what it brings and I'm sure with both of us being thoughtful and caring people, we will handle it with grace and compassion, whatever it is...  I hope you have fun on your trip.   S

      S makes me feel gorgeous.  Let's get that out of the way.  It's sick, really, how great I feel around him.  I'm tempted, for example, to go everywhere now in my bikini.  Like to the bank.  And to visit people in the hospital.  And things are... that  way.  That just-discovered, subways-can't-move-fast-enough-for-me-to-get-to-his-apartment, my-life-is-like-a-movie-with-the-fucking-best-soundtrack-EVER, way.  I mean I email him Microsoft Paint pictures, for god's sake.  It sounds disgusting (and, frankly, it is), but it's also SO MUCH FUCKING FUN I CAN'T STAND IT.   I send him cute little perfectly illustrated funny drawings of things I want us to do on our dates.  And he sends me back cute little terribly illustrated barely recognizeable but really fucking funny drawings back.  We do this all day.     We  draw  to each other.    So obviously everything is silly and marvelous and sexy and thrilling.  And you're all The Most Sincere Good-Hearted Best-Wishing Super-Curious Movie Star Angels for being so excited for me and sending us soooo much enthusiasm and good luck.  And the world is a perfect place, every day is Saturday, they've invented a pill that you can take instead of doing sit-ups, this pill tastes like chocolate sundaes, S is the second man in the world who is able to give me orgasms*, Paris Hilton has been eaten by cannibals on a recent vacation to South America, and  Oh my God what the hell am I gonna blog about?   I mean, now I'm that girl.  The one with the cottage by the sea.  And her cat.  And her man.  And her total fucking happiness.  Tra-la-la.  La-la...um...La.  OR  I'm that  other  girl.  The one who finally gets what she wants and can't be happy about it.  Because, truth be told, she actually  likes  being miserable.  She thrives on it, if she's being honest.  She's a fucking New Yorker, after all.  Happiness makes her uneasy.  BUT  I  am  happy.  There's no use denying it.  People tell me I'm glowing.  And I can often be seen doing high-kicks on street corners because when I talk to him on the phone I feel like jumping.  STILL HOWEVER  I don't want to become one of those annoying women who starts every sentence with "My boyfriend and I..."    NOR DO I   want to become--even worse--one of those women who punctuates everything with a giggle, and says things like, "I know I've only known him for fourteen days..."  BUT  I know I've only known him for fourteen days....  AND  Now I have these conversations with S about  feelings .  He can talk about  feelings .  I can say, "Hey S!  Let's talk about feelings"  and  his head won't explode .  Or maybe I might say, "Hey, S!  I really like you a lot," and (are you ready for this...it's fucking amazing!)  he'll say, "I like you a lot too."   HOWEVER  I just want to say that there is  still  and  will always be  a huuuuge difference between me and those "The bridesmaid dresses will be mauve, I think.  I also think four flower girls and two ring bearers would be cute.  They'll wear teal" kind of women.   AND FURTHERMORE  When I say "I know I've only known him for fourteen days," what I mean is "So it's great that I'm already comfortable enough around him to take my shoes off without worrying that my feet smell,"    AND NOT    "Where's the fucking engagement ring already, Mister?  If you're afraid of commitment I need to know now because time is a wastin' and I ain't gettin' any younger!  Got that?"  DON'T GET ME WRONG, THOUGH  I would rather die than fart around him.  Smelly feet, I'm over.  But the thought of farting around him keeps me up at night.  WHICH REMINDS ME  To tell you that we're going to wait to sleep together.  Both in a "sleep in the same bed" and "have sex" kind of way.  BRINGING ME BACK TO  Tra-la-la-la.  Why hello, little bluebird.  Come!  Skip with me!  AND YET  Fucking shoot me.  Gah.  *shudders* Bluebirds creep me out.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THOUGH  There's only five more hours left until I get to kiss him more!  SO  Time  move faster already  because five hours seems like:       f o r e v e r  BUT WAIT A MINUTE HERE  Can someone get me a martini?  Someone?  God.  I mean, puhlease, People.  Really.  Next she'll be doing high kicks and skipping around in circles.  And then what?   Yuck.  All this bloody happiness is fucking irritating.  Someone call M!  Can someone get M back in here?  And what about that Unholy Slutwhore Person?  She was great.  Someone get her on the phone.  Call Hell.  So what you don't have the number.  Call Information.  That slut gal was interesting.  None of this fucking bluebird bullshit was happening when she and M ran the show.  God, I have a headache.  Hello?!  Martini, People!  Where's my martini?!?  Christ.  YET AT THE SAME TIME  *skips around in circles and does high kicks*  BUT WAIT A MINUTE HERE...AGAIN  I am realizing something.  WHICH IS  That, even happy, I am still psychotic.  FINE THEN,  I feel better.   ALSO  My bikini is gonna bring joy to a lot of sick people.     *That one's true.

      My job this week has entailed sitting in apartment buildings, trying to explain to people relocating to the city from Colorado, that they will never find a 1500 square foot two-bedroom in the Union Square area, that allows pets, and has outdoor space, AND is under $500 a month.  Ever.   Sadly, for all involved, there is no computer in these apartment buildings, and, as you can see, I am now overusing commas, and neglecting my blog, as a result.  I am sorry about the commas, and very, very, very,,,,sorry about neglecting the blog.  I will do what I can to remedy the situation ASAP.  In the meantime, I'm visiting David again this weekend.  And if anyone can help, it's him.  He may even be able to help with the punctuation situation.  Keep your fingers crossed.

      91. Train ride from Lucca, Italy to Nice, France.  Drinking wine out of paper cups.  Thinking that  Boris Godunov --which someone was humming--sounds exactly like the theme from "Indiana Jones."  Tucked like crumbs into the cracks of red, velvet train seats.  Everyone in their bare feet.  Windows-open-fly-by-sky-by-water-by-moon-by--for the whole night.  And knowing, in the moment, that someday when I was old and wanting to remember what it was like to be young, that that was the night I'd remember.   92. Moving into my first post-college apartment with Emily.  Sitting all day on the street by the green sofa I'd found, which was my treasure, but someone else's trash.  Guarding it jealously 'til Emily came home from work.  Then, Emily coming home.  Contributing her 110 pounds of might (which is to say, not much might, but lots of heart) to The Moving The Sofa To Our Second-Story Apartment Effort.  Balancing precariously on the top stair in the hallway of our building, anchoring the green monstrosity with my entire body, sweating and shaking from effort and laughter.  Emily fleeing to the street to find aid, and, instead, returning with Not-So-Handy Jeff.  Who lived up to his name.  But still managed to help these two crazy, snort-laughing girls procure their first real piece of furniture.  93. My first call-back for  Rent.   94. Senior night at The Roxy.  In the green summer dress my parents had bought me, that looks nothing like a dress you'd think any parents would ever buy.  A certain boy.  The only slow song of the evening.  The sexiest thing I've ever done with my clothes still on.  95. My first couple of weeks driving around the country in a van with six other actors, getting paid to do what I love.  96. 6:20 AM.  Sidewalk in Times Square.  Cold and waiting for the audition sign-up to start.  Cell phone call to Wisconsin.  Good morning, Mom.  Hi, Papa.  97. A walk I took down Broadway once in college.  Post  Jacob's Room .  Finding myself in the throng of people and traffic lights and street lamps and bodegas. Finding myself.  98.  Dear Applicant, We are pleased to offer you a scholarship in the amount of...     99. Pretty much any night I've ever spent that involves Emily and a living room.  100. The letter I found in my suitcase last Friday.   Dearest Kathryn ....  The kindest letter I have ever read.   Love, David   One hundred things.  Fucking FINALLY.

      When I break up with men:   I cry.    They?  Decorate.  I'll give you some statistics to set the backstory.  First major boyfriend after college: Dan  His age when we dated: 29-30 Length of our relationship: Approx. 6 mos.  Number of rooms in Dan's beautiful, LARGE, Upper Westside apartment: 4 Number of years Dan had lived in this apartment before we dated: 6 Number of pieces of furniture Dan owned: 4   Making the average number of pieces of furniture per room: 1 Meaning that, aside from his bed, he had: A couch, a kitchen table, and a chair. Number of chairs Dan had when we began dating, just to re-emphasize, for those who are slow: 1  Number of times I sat on the floor when I visited him: All Number of colors represented throughout his apartment in the form of wall-paint: None Number of plants he owned (living): 0 Number of plants he owned (dead): 5  Number of times he wanted to put glow-in-the-dark star stickers on his bedroom ceiling: Several Number of times I stopped him: Every  Percentage of the income set aside for furniture/home improvements that he spent buying  the hugest television that I have ever seen : 100%  Color of the SHAGGY CARPET IN HIS BATHROOM: navy blue   Evidence that best represents Dan's level of maturity and ability to commit:    The day we got a dog.  The day we got a dog, and Dan paced, and fretted, and panicked, and shook, and ranted, and lamented, and waxed poetic about his freedom, and his youth, and his bachelorhood, and nearly broke down crying.  And almost took the dog back.  But, ultimately, decided to keep him.  But, barely.  ********  Second major boyfriend after college: M His age when we dated: 29-30 Length of our relationship: This depends on whether you count the unknown number of months that he was fucking The Unholy Slutwhore From Hell.   In which case: I'm stumped.   I guess it might be: -1 month   Length of our relationship (As recorded, had I never found out about TUSFH): 11 mos.  Number of rooms in M's Upper Westside apartment: 2 Number of years M had lived in this apartment: I can't remember. At least 4.  Number of colors represented throughout M's apartment in the form of wall-paint: None Number of plants he owned (period): 0 Number of practical dishes owned by M: 0 Number of extremely expensive business-gift-type crystal brandy decanters owned by M: 3 Only food ever cooked in M's apartment while we dated: Raman Number of pictures hung on M's walls: 0 Number of pictures stacked on M's floor: 7  Number of cute decorative items I gave M during our relationship: 3 Number of cute decorative items I took back when I found out about The Slutwhore: 3   Most thoughtful decorating decision made by M  before  we dated: Purchase of Map-of-the-World shower curtain  Most thoughtful decorating decision made by M  while  we dated: Lightbulbs  Color of the FUTON he slept on: navy blue  Number of months I had to  reach INSIDE of his toilet in order to flush it : 11  Evidence that best represents M's level of maturity and ability to commit:   I'll give you a clue.  She's Unholy.  She's a Slutwhore.  She's from Hell.  FLASH FORWARD TO.......   Dan :  Currently (as of last contact) the proud owner of: one black dog, one gorgeous red sofa, four kitchen chairs, a dining room table, one sun-shaped wall clock, one framed set of stamps from my mother, four fully-painted rooms, two hall tables, one tiled bathroom, multiple decorative pillows, and a partridge in a pear tree.   Oh, and one wife.  He started decorating: The day we broke up. He started to call me to tell me about his decorating: The day we broke up.  Number of months between our break-up and his engagement: 8   And M :  He took off of work for a week and started decorating: The day we broke up. He started to call me to tell me about his decorating: The day we broke up. Number of times he'd taken off of work in the year that I knew him, prior to this: None Number of pictures now hung on his wall (as of last contact): 7 Number of items cleaned and dusted for the first time, number of CD cases thrown out, number of books rearranged, number of minutes spent on his knees with a Dirt Devil, number of papers organized, number of hours spent contemplating how to arrange his furniture, number of shirts taken to the cleaners for the first time in months: Countless  And number of toilets fixed: 1   SO THAT IS WHY......   Last Wednesday, when I walked into David's apartment, and saw...  ...the green plants in every window.  ...the furniture already arranged.  ...the pictures hung.  ...and the walls painted...  I laughed and laughed, and hugged him and laughed some more.  And then, when I saw...  ...the champagne that he'd gotten to celebrate my first visit down.  ...the avocados he'd bought for me, because I'd told him I'm addicted lately, and they're practically all I eat.  ...the Coca-Cola he'd stocked in the refrigerator.  ...and the keys he'd made for me, which he handed me with a kiss and a smile...  I almost couldn't speak,   I felt so welcome in his home.

      After M, I made a list.   Things I Am Looking For In A Relationship That I Am Recording Here So That I Won't Forget Them, Even If I Meet Someone Semi-Famous Who Wrote One Of My Favorite Movies And Can Make A Mean Vegan Cookie But Who, Otherwise, Is Totally Unprepared To Include Another Person In His Life *  This list is as follows:  1) He must be ready to share his life.  This one's first for a reason. 2) Intelligent. 3) Must use his intelligence. 4) Gotta be funny. 5) Stable. 6) Emotionally generous. 7) He must be supportive of this Guest Relations Associate/Actress/Writer/Whatever Else I Decide I Might Want To Be, at all costs. 8) He must take care of himself.  This refers to his ability to be responsible for his own life, and NOT his ability to maintain manicured hands and feet. 9) He will make me a priority.  How S Measured Up:  RE: 1) Immediately and adamantly ruled out seeing each other more than once a week so that he could have the necessary amount of  urlLink Alone Time .  Initiated conversation, wherein he suggested we "remain open to seeing other people."  Refused to allow me to sleep over.  Never introduced me to any of his friends. And so on...after only a few short weeks, I could fill a novel.   RE: 2) Intelligent? Check.  RE: 3) Uses Intelligence to write, direct, act.    RE: 4) Funny? Half-Check.  Occasionally uses material from his movies.  And by "occasionally" I mean  all the freaking time.   Most of it was better on screen.  RE: 5) Stable...like a hyperactive, extremely caffeinated, two-year-old with vertigo, who is trying to balance on a teeter-totter, which has been loosely strapped to the back of an epileptic, galloping pony...is stable.    RE: 6)  Ok.  It's time for you to go home now.  Thanks for coming over. *Pats me on the head* I had fun.  Bye.   RE: 7)  Good luck on your little audition today.    Or then there was:    I think it's sweet that you have your little blog.  But, I just think--I mean, as someone who's a professional--that that whole trend is just kind of annoying.  Like now everyone has a chance to put in their two cents, write about their lives.  Every person with a laptop can criticize the people who are actually out there, doing it.  Like me.   RE: 8) Jury's out.  Depends on how you look at it.  Doesn't matter anyway.  RE: 9) I was somewhere after "Watch re-runs of  America's Most Wanted ," but possibly before "Learn to juggle."  Possibly.  But, if I were a betting woman, I'd say he spent a lot of his Alone Time with about eight tennis balls and a "How To" book.  Just a hunch.    Bottom line. I meant what I said about what I want.    I want selflessness, not ego.  No more inability to communicate.  No more fear.  Not another M.  No more, "I Can Change Him's."  Never again to, "He Would Be Perfect, If Only He Would Just...."  No future blogs will be started as the result of my once-again broken heart.  I don't need the fairy tale.  But, I do need  urlLink The Hand Thing .  So that's why S was out.  Way out.  "Floating on the edge of the solar system near Pluto, happy--at last--to have no one around to take any of his fries" kind of out.   I was planning to have one final talk with him to let him know...  When, last Saturday, he called me (for the first time!) from Mexico, where he had been on a yoga retreat for  20 days.    Having made plans with David for Monday night, I told S that I couldn't see him Monday when he got in.  Me: "I can see you on Tuesday.  You get in late Monday anyway.  Tuesday will be good."  S: "Why not Monday?"  "Because I have plans."  "What plans?"  "Well.  Because I'm going to a benefit."  "Oh. *hurt/challenging/aggressive* You're going on a date."  "Yes.  Sorry, I didn't mean for it to come out like this.  But, yes.  I have a date.  I don't want to lie about it.  Besides.  We talked about this.  We decided we should still see other people. You suggested it.  That's why you wanted to have that talk before I went on the cruise."  "How many times have you been out with this person? Are you sleeping with him?  Have you kissed him?"  "Tomorrow night will be our third date.  Why are you acting like this?  I don't understand.  We agreed that we would see other people."  It went on from there.  Did I like this new person?  Had I told him about S?  Had I slept with him?  Was I sure I hadn't slept with him?  He didn't seem to hear my answers.  As usual, he was hearing only what was coming from his own head. It was as though he had no recollection that seeing other people was his idea.  As though I had lied to him.  He hung up, claiming that he'd call me when he got back.  As expected, an hour later, I got another email.    This one was accusatory.  He felt that I was obviously just using him for sex.  He doesn't trust me.  He called me dishonest.  Couldn't believe I had been "diving into" another person, and had already gone on "so many" dates when he's been away for only "a couple of days."  And he had been so open with me.  Had really been working on building something special with me.  And so on, and so on.  My behavior is disgusting.  He doesn't want to see me when he gets back.  Good-bye.  Well.  There it is.  Good-bye.  Good riddance.     *working title

      Would you believe me if I told you that I had so much fun at the black tie on Monday, that I'm off to visit David in DC this weekend?  Well, you should.  'Cause I am.  Chinatown Bus: New York to DC.  Leaving in half an hour.  See you all Saturday....

      Not this.  But, on the plus side,  I  still have both of my ears.   Anyway, we're gonna move on and try not to dwell on the fact that I took Bellow's cute, little, primitive-but-adorable design, and grabbed it while it was skipping around happily on the internet, burbling and chirping, and playing with pots and pans, and drooling endearingly on other web site's key rings...  ...and I clubbed it over the head until it died.  Screaming in agony.  Suffering in the dark.  Alone.  And frightened.  ANYway.    Let's welcome #0000CD Blue to the scene, and let's thank him profusely for tempering the whole Christmas-Year-Round-At-Bellow Feeling that was bothering us all.    Changeisgood, changeisgood, changeisgood.  And away we go.

      What have I done?  My hands are all sweaty.  And my nose won't uncrinkle.  I hate this new green.  I am not a green person.  I'm a bold red.  A snazzy yellow.  My webpage looks like a John Deer ad.    God, and the font.  Look at this  font .  I AM NEW COURIER, GOD DAMMIT, NOT FUCKING WHATEVER THE FUCK THIS NEW FONT IS.  What is this new font called?  If I could only find in the html code where this new font is described, THEN I COULD CHANGE IT!!!  Crap.  I need a Coke.  Ok.  Whoo.  Breathe.     Change is good, though.  Right?  Change is good. *Repeats new mantra frantically to Self.* Changeisgood,changeisgood,changeisgood.  hroghuhhhhuuuoooooo.  (For those confused by the real-life sound reflected by that last series of letters, think petulance with a dash of tragic self-pity.)  Crap, crap.

      Someone today asked me what I want in a relationship, so I told them this story.  The day my friend had her first baby was also the day that her brother died.    She got the phone call about Thomas's death early in the morning: a heart attack, sudden, unexpected, unexplainable.  Though still two weeks away from her due date, the shock made her go into early labor, and when she got to the hospital, they recommended that she be induced rather than given drugs to stop the contractions.  I had never had a close friend have a baby before.  In my head, the day was going to be so  happy --Christmas times ten thousand.  Sure, there'd be some nervousness about the delivery, but other than that, nothing but unwrapping cute baby-sized hats and pajamas.  Nothing but smile after smile.  Instead, the day was about tension.  Presents were awkward to offer in such a silent room.  And, instead of nerves, there was real fear.    At 42, there were already risks for her.  And the labor alone would've been exhausting, but to do it in that condition; I had never seen her eyes so still.  Her body was swollen and heated, but her face was just limp, like something left too long in the rain.  We stayed through the night. My friend's husband, taking breaks in the waiting room before the labor started, told the story of their first date.  We all smiled about her stubborn streak and their unconventional courtship.  He told stories about all the things he loved about her, and it made us laugh.  We worried for her and the baby, which made us cry.  While he went to be with her, we sat, we left, we came back.   I understand, now, about waiting.  Sometime the next afternoon, the baby was finally born.  They named him Thomas, and we loved him all the more for his dramatic, heart-breaking timing.  He was perfect, and tiny, and a wailing, squirming example of all the things that life can be.  There was a moment when, slowly recovering her senses, my friend was sitting in bed, talking to me and holding Thomas.  Our conversation was about what every conversation in maternity rooms is about: his baby smell, his baby hands, and his perfect, small baby feet.  Our smiles stayed on now--how could they not, with those ten tiny little toes?--but our voices were still strained.  We understood with particular clarity the truth of the world we were welcoming him to.  As my friend talked to me, she was suddenly, I assume, hit with some physical pain.  Without saying a word, without so much as a noise or even a look, she held her hand out to her husband.  Though he was also in the middle of a conversation with another friend, he reached over and took her hand.  She was too weak to move on her own--still too swollen and ripped apart.  So he helped her sit up.  Neither of their conversations ever paused.  Their eyes never met.  They both continued talking, as though nothing had happened.   I sat in my chair in the corner, and knew I'd remember that moment.  You'll never see them in a Hollywood movie.  Her arms were purple from bruises.  Her eyes were bloodshot.  She wasn't pretty.  And he was grey with worry, and unshowered from nights of waiting.  And they had a squalling baby instead of Dom Perignon and a suite filled with rose-petals.    But his hand was there almost before she knew she needed it.    And that's what love is.

      David may be a vegetarian, but S?  S is VEGAN.  A Vegan who should, apparently, have come with an instruction manual.  Because S:  1) Does not like me to look at, or smile at him *while* he's eating.  As previously mentioned, such behavior reminds him of his father. 2) Does not like me to touch him IN ANY WAY *during* meals or *immediately after* he's eaten. 3) Does not like me to taste, touch or otherwise try any of his food EVER.  If I think I may want some of whatever it is he is eating, I must notify him of this impending desire, and he will then make or order EXTRA so that I can have my own, since taking even one French Fry (for example) off of his plate is EXPRESSLY FORBIDDEN, and, if we didn't live in the modern United States of America, MIGHT ACTUALLY BE PUNISHABLE BY DEATH.  Or, at least, that's the way he acts about it if you (for example) try to test him on this and take a fry. 4) Does not allow me to stay at his apartment to sleep over EVER, because "he doesn't sleep well with people."   5) Additionally, all visiting parties--meaning me--must exit his apartment at or before 1:30 AM EST, as that is when he hits what is called "The Wall" and needs what is called "Alone Time." 6) "Alone Time" is necessary at the following additional times:     * All-day Sunday so that he can continue his tradition of watching sports alone on his couch from dawn til dusk.      * Whenever else the mood strikes him. Including after I've been away for five days and we've had absolutely NO CONTACT and you'd think he'd be happy to see me, but he's not.  Not really.  Because, actually he's hoping I'll just pop by for a brief visit on Saturday after I fly in.  Seeing as he's had a busy week AND NEEDS SOME ALONE TIME.  7) When not having "Alone Time," the following is a short sample of Things You Will NOT Find S Doing Because They Are Things That S Does NOT Do:     * You will not find S at the movies.  As a maker of movies, he considers this to be "work."    * You will not find S at the theater. As an actor, he considers this to be work.    * You will not find S at any event where people gather together to listen to or tell stories.  As a writer/director, he considers it difficult to watch other people's meager attempts at doing what it is that he does so well.    * You will not find S at bars, non-vegan restaurants, dances or clubs of any sort.  Neither will you find him taking long walks, visiting me in Brooklyn, or generally leaving his apartment for any reason other than work or yoga.  And since he works primarily from home...well, you do the math.    In short, you will not find him on a train, you will not find him in a plane.  You will not find him in a tram, and (until they make it with organic soy) he will not eat green eggs and ham.  And you know where else you won't find him?    WITH ME.  That's for DAMN sure.

      As all eyes in America turn towards Boston and the DNC, people across the nation are finally asking the important questions:&nbsp; How do we work to repair the damage done in the Middle East?&nbsp; How do we help US workers whose jobs have been displaced because of outsourcing?&nbsp; What of healthcare?&nbsp; What steps are necessary to build a safer, more secure America?   As I packed for David's house last night,&nbsp;listening to the Convention speakers incite Americans to stand up and ask the tough questions, I was inspired to add my own voice to the fray.&nbsp;&nbsp;   So to that end, my friends, I ask you:   Is it OK to reuse lingerie?   Because, frankly,&nbsp;I'm feeling weird about it.   While going through my underwear drawer, it occurred to me that I have had some of that stuff for a long time.&nbsp; In fact, some of&nbsp;my frilliest underwear may remember a&nbsp;time when Academy-Award Winning Actress Hillary Swank was still just a single mom, trying to&nbsp;make things work with&nbsp;Steve Sanders on  90210 .&nbsp; Which--in  Beverly Hills  terms--means that some of my lingerie has seen considerably more action than Andrea's did&nbsp;when she was a geeky virgin.&nbsp;   Though, let's be&nbsp;clear:&nbsp;NOT as much as Brenda's did&nbsp;during her Worrisome&nbsp;Slut Phase.&nbsp;   Hmmm.&nbsp; Come to think of it, my underwear and I are probably more "Kelly."&nbsp;   But, I bet every girl thinks she's a Kelly.&nbsp; Which is absurd, because I am so much more like Kelly than any of you&nbsp;skanky bitches.&nbsp; You all probably  think  you're like Kelly, but you're really like Donna, and you just don't want to admit it to yourselves.   Which is so lame.&nbsp;   I mean, get over it already.&nbsp;   Donna's not so bad.&nbsp; During The Prom Episode when she got drunk, all the kids banded together and protested so she'd graduate.&nbsp;   See?&nbsp;   Everyone loves Donna.&nbsp;   Not as much as they love Kelly.&nbsp;   But still.&nbsp;   Whatever.   ...   Hey...   Hey, Look.   I hate it when we fight.&nbsp;   I'm sorry.   Let's never fight again, okay?   Friends?   Good.&nbsp;   Let's go shopping.   *Hug*   ...   HAH!&nbsp;   Got you!&nbsp; Suckers!&nbsp; I was just doing that to prove how like Kelly I am.&nbsp;  I'm so like Kelly .&nbsp; No one could ever stay mad at Kelly either.   Anyway.&nbsp;   Now that that's settled.&nbsp;   Where was I?   Oh.   About lingerie.&nbsp;   So, a single item in my lingerie drawer may have encountered anywhere between three and five of the various men I've dated and/or just made-out with.&nbsp;   And that's really a little strange when you think about it.&nbsp; It's weird to have worn the matching bra-and-(sorry, Emily, I know you hate this word)-panty set that I bought for Dan's birthday... for M.&nbsp; Or to remember so clearly how Luis slipped his hand up my skirt while I was wearing the black thong that I later wore for  urlLink Unicorn &nbsp;sometime last Spring.   Now let me be clear, &nbsp;it's all in pristine condition.&nbsp; I don't wear the nicest stuff that often--special occasions mostly (Christmas, Groundhog Day), and lord knows it doesn't stay on very long, so it's&nbsp;very close to almost new.&nbsp; But, even so.&nbsp; It's a bit odd when you think about it.&nbsp; I mean, I wouldn't have bought all of those various men the same Christmas&nbsp;present.&nbsp; Wouldn't re-use the same card at birthday-time.&nbsp; Or&nbsp;alternate wearing one of, like,&nbsp;eight dresses&nbsp;to every date I'd been on since 1996.&nbsp;   But on the other hand, who can afford to keep buying a new $50 bra every time she wants to get a little lovin' from a new man?&nbsp; And, obviously, he won't know the difference.&nbsp; So  what  if I purchased the little pink number&nbsp;originally to celebrate an anniversary with the last boyfriend?&nbsp; (Though, THANK GOD underwear can't talk.&nbsp; Because, wouldn't  that  be embarrassing?&nbsp; In the midst of rolling around with a new lust-interest, and your knickers pipe up, "She bought us for the last bloke, you know.&nbsp;&nbsp; And he had a bigger dick.")   Hmmm.&nbsp; Though, singing knickers could add quite a nice harmony line to the  urlLink arm-hair caroling .   Things to think about.   In any case, it's&nbsp;certainly a dilemma&nbsp;that the Democratic Party will need to&nbsp;take seriously in order to get my vote.

      Her name is Kim.&nbsp; Well, actually, we highly doubt that her  real  name is Kim, just as we doubt that her co-workers--none of whom speak English--are  actually  named "Liz," "Stacey," or "Kate."&nbsp; But, she's called "Kim" on her nametag, so Kim it will be.   And Kim hates&nbsp;body hair.&nbsp;  She cannot abide it .&nbsp; If Kim were a superhero--which, let's face it, she might be--her mission on earth would be to seek out&nbsp;body hair in all corners of the world, and  smite it .   Kim The Bikini-Waxing Avenger would&nbsp;wear an outfit made entirely of linen strips, her&nbsp;arms would shoot&nbsp;hot wax from the wrists, and she would wield&nbsp;The Golden Tweezers of Infinite Doom.&nbsp; Italian men with back hair would quake with terror at the mere mention of her name.&nbsp;   I can't decide if I think she has a sidekick.&nbsp;&nbsp; She may have had one at some point, and&nbsp;he pissed her off, so she&nbsp;waxed him to death.   I'm serious about this.&nbsp;   Kim does  not  fuck around.   Whenever I am on a table with my legs spread in the air for a new aesthetician, I make some&nbsp;disparaging comment about women and how crazy we are for&nbsp;undergoing the skin-tearing torture that is The Bikini Wax.&nbsp; It is my version of Bikini Wax Small Talk.   I made such a comment while on&nbsp;Kim's crinkly paper-covered&nbsp;waxing table last week.   "Boy, we women are crazy to do this, aren't we?" I said, laughing&nbsp;lamely.   Kim looked at me sharply.   For a moment, I thought she might hit me.   Before I tell you what she told me, let me&nbsp;just say that&nbsp;Kim may have learned&nbsp;English from listening to&nbsp;the adults on the  Peanut's  cartoons.&nbsp;&nbsp; And though it is fair to say that--to her credit--her English is a hell of a lot better than my&nbsp;Mandarin, it is also fair to say that the adverb&nbsp;which best&nbsp;describes the way that&nbsp;Kim speaks English is:  barely .&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  So&nbsp;I really&nbsp;have no idea what Kim said to me so vehemently, as she ripped the hair from my body.&nbsp;   None at all.   BUT, because I am me, I will tell you what I  think  she said.   I think she told me that her husband married her because she had a hairless pussy.&nbsp;   I would, in fact, testify to this in a court of law.   For Kim, then, body hair has no place in a healthy relationship.&nbsp; And once she found out that I have a boyfriend,   Kim.   Went.   To&nbsp; town.    I'll spare you the gory details, but, suffice it to say, at one point she pulled out a magnifying lens.   A MAGNIFYING LENS.&nbsp;   Show of hands.&nbsp; Who here has ever had someone pull out a fucking magnifying&nbsp;lens during a bikini wax?&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Thought so.&nbsp;   Let me just tell you, it is an  intense  experience--probably for all involved.&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as awkward goes: off the charts.&nbsp; As far as baby-bottom smoothness goes: you have no idea.&nbsp; I'm considering asking David to guest blog a testimonial.&nbsp;   Bottom Line: My arm hair is still traumatized from the experience, afraid that I'll unleash Kim on it next.&nbsp; Last night, my arm hairs actually woke me up,&nbsp;their tiny, follicle voices screaming&nbsp;from fear.&nbsp;   And as soon as I teach them some Christmas carols, I am so having all of you over for dinner.

      When it comes to body-image issues, on a scale of 1 to 10--a 1 being "So&nbsp;Issue-Free I've Even Grown To Love My Back Fat" and a 10 being "So Anorexic That When I Get Very Hungry&nbsp;I Allow Myself To&nbsp;Lick Advil"--I am about a 5.&nbsp;   A&nbsp;3 on a good day.&nbsp;   A 9 and 1/2 whenever I go to the New York Sports Club in Soho and stand too near a naked&nbsp;model in the locker room.&nbsp; (Don't worry.&nbsp; I have stopped exercising all together in order to avoid this problem.)   But, all&nbsp;in all, I feel curvy and sexy 90% of the time.&nbsp; And, for a girl who at one point in her life chewed donuts and then spit them out to get the&nbsp;taste but not the calories, I'd say I've come a long way.&nbsp;   Though one could argue that there was really nowhere to go from The Chewing/Spitting Out Phase, but up.   Anyway.   There&nbsp;are two&nbsp;exceptions to my new "I'm Twenty-Five Now And Tired Of Pretending That Tasti-Delite Tastes Like Real Ice Cream" Healthy Body Image.&nbsp;&nbsp;   My.   Thighs.   I hate them.&nbsp;   If they were a color they'd be puce.&nbsp; If they were a&nbsp;subject, they'd be&nbsp;Advanced Algebra/Trig. &nbsp;&nbsp;I hate them so much--are you ready for this--that  if&nbsp;my thighs&nbsp;were&nbsp; running for&nbsp;President in this year's&nbsp;election,&nbsp;I would vote Bush.  &nbsp;   *Gasp*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Yes.&nbsp; I hate them  that  much.&nbsp;   Which&nbsp;means that, unless I'm forced to lift up my skirt and kick off my heels because a GIGANTIC FUCKING SLIMY SCUTTLING HALF-ROACH HALF-SPIDER&nbsp;BEAST MONSTER IS RUNNING AFTER ME WITH A PARTIALLY DEVOURED HUMAN BODY HANGING FROM ITS GAPING MAW...   ...you will never see my legs above the knee.   And even then, its maw better be  gaping  and it better have a full-on scuttle, not just some weird could-be-a-scuttle, could-be-a-straightforward run.&nbsp; Because a full-on scuttle is fucking  terrifying , but a partial scuttle/partial run is just kind of awkward looking, and maybe even a little funny.   Bottom Line: Every skirt or dress I own was purchased because it shows exactly as much leg as I am comfortable showing.&nbsp; No more.&nbsp; No less.&nbsp; Period.   Enter: David.   Enter the fact that David is blinded by lust.&nbsp;   Couple that with his constant need to bring me surprises....add a recent trip to Hong Kong, and... Voila!&nbsp; You have the shortest, most form-fitting white silk Chinese dress ever known to man, currently hanging&nbsp;in my closet, where it takes up almost no room at all, because it's basically the size of a scarf or a&nbsp;mitten.   Now.&nbsp; Before the comment box gets filled with bitter notes&nbsp;from librarians in the Midwest telling me to be grateful for his kindness, let me be clear:&nbsp;   IT IS A BEAUTIFUL DRESS, AND I LOVE THAT HE BOUGHT IT FOR ME.   I love that he bought it for me, and I love that the dress that he bought me is form-fitting and sexy.&nbsp; And, I might add, I love that it's a size "small."&nbsp; I love that--standing in the shop where he purchased it--he thought long and hard about me and my body, and the word that seemed most appropriate to describe  my  physical being was:    small. &nbsp;    David is a Superhero Genius.    Even  more  lovely, is the fact that this  small  dress   fit .&nbsp;   Because you have&nbsp; no idea &nbsp;how stressed I was when I saw the "S" on the tag, and envisioned myself struggling into the dress--which he, of course, insisted I&nbsp;try on--only to find that it ripped, or wouldn't zipper, or, even worse, got stuck somewhere mid-hip, unable to stretch across THE VAST EXPANSE OF MY&nbsp;THIGHS.&nbsp;    But, it fit.&nbsp; It FIT!&nbsp;&nbsp;It looked horrible.&nbsp; But, it FIT!   As I stared into the mirror in my bedroom,&nbsp;aghast at how much leg this lovely but SHORT dress exposed,&nbsp;I thought the following:   "My thighs are like huge sausages."&nbsp;   &nbsp;Then I thought, "Hey.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; So we'll have a good laugh.&nbsp; He'll see me in this beautiful but Oh-my-GOD-so-short dress and&nbsp;understand why it is that my&nbsp;sausage-thighs have never seen the light of day.&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll tell me&nbsp;that he thinks I'm&nbsp;sexy and perfect, and that,&nbsp;when I wear the dress&nbsp;for him&nbsp; in the privacy of his apartment , it will drive him wild."   With those thoughts in&nbsp;mind, I entered the living room.&nbsp;   So.   You know those cartoon scenes when the&nbsp;Tazmanian Devil sees Bugs Bunny dressed up as a female Tazmanian Devil, and he doesn't realize it's just Bugs with a wig, and he spins around a lot, and his jaw drops to the&nbsp;floor, his pupils turn to hearts, and&nbsp;his&nbsp;ears make steaming, honking noises?   Well, David did that.   "He's just being nice," I thought,&nbsp;sure that&nbsp;some comment about wearing the dress  for him... alone...later that night...in his room ,&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;follow.   "When I come to stay next month, I'll&nbsp;be wearing this when you come home from work," I purred, trying to give&nbsp;us both the opportunity to silently acknowledge MY ENORMOUS THIGHS.   "No way," he said.&nbsp; "You look too good.&nbsp; When you wear that dress, I'm taking you&nbsp; out ."   On the one hand: FUCK.&nbsp;   On the other hand:&nbsp;Huh.&nbsp;&nbsp; If he really did think I looked stupid, I'd given him the perfect opt-out option.&nbsp; And  still  he insisted that I looked amazing.&nbsp; How 'bout that?    David is a Superhero Genius, But He Also Has Very Bad Eyesight.    Later, after he had left and I was alone, examining the dress from every angle&nbsp;and wondering if maybe stilts would make my legs look longer, &nbsp;I suddenly realized that I have only one real viable option.&nbsp; If I'm going to have to show my stumpy legs in public at some later date  with  David, I'll have to practice walking around in public in the dress,  without  him.   So,&nbsp;to that end, this&nbsp;Sunday evening I will be grocery shopping in&nbsp;Park Slope wearing the highest high heels I can find, and my&nbsp;uber-short, lovely white Chinese dress.&nbsp;   You should all come out and cheer me on.

      Two weeks ago, David spent some time in Maryland at a camp that he volunteers at almost every summer. The campers in his cabin are boy's boys--they're funny and gross. This year, one of them was an aspiring rapper. Another was pumped up about being a college sophomore with a new girlfriend. All the guys love the female counselors and talk a lot about which ones they would like to date. They make dirty jokes; they tease one another incessantly.   And when the week at camp was over and I was sitting across from David, listening to him describe the best acts from the talent show, I just sat there, amazed. Because at David's camp, all of the campers are born with a muscularly degenerative disease. So, in addition to the horsing around and joke-telling, one of David's jobs as a counselor is to help the campers turn themselves in the middle of the night. In fact, many of the kids use motorized wheelchairs and ventilators. And most of them won't live much past their twenties.   David doesn't make his time at camp about the kids' sickness, nor does he paint himself as some sort of hero, so, I'll try to do the same. But nonetheless, I think what David does is extraordinary. I asked him how he can get so close to kids he knows might not be around next year, and he talks about it very simply. He loves to be their arms and legs for a week. That  killed  me when he said it, and killed me even more later, when I saw the video of him in the pool with them, lifting the kids in the water and zipping them around.   It amazes me. This capacity he has to offer himself without fear of rejection or loss, though simultaneously with enough to wisdom to acknowledge that hurt and loss  are  possible.   From the moment I met him, he has given me this same type of boldness.   Though I've been wanting to sit him and my dad down since I first found out how many interests they had in common, I was squelching any thoughts of a trip to my house for Thanksgiving, sure that David would run for his life. Until:   "I'm trying to figure out my vacation days," he called one day to tell me, "because I figure I'll want to spend Thanksgiving somewhere with you."   I laughed so hard, I couldn't talk for five minutes.   I'll never be able to tell him how much things like that mean to me--mostly because I'm usually laughing too hard, but also because I don't think I'm that good with words.   "Are you always like this?" I have asked him several times.   Having told him all about  urlLink the posers  and  urlLink the crazies ,  he knows enough to know my skepticism is warranted. But he just grabs me and laughs into my hair.   "You know weird people," he'll tell me. "I'm just normal."   Then he'll kiss me and tell me what I swear is the prettiest three-word poem I've ever heard:   "You're my girl," he'll say.   After that, my heart tells my brain to shut up.   ...   This normal guy's favorite book is Steinbeck's  East of Eden , and because I'm doing that thing that we all do when we fall for someone, I took it off my bookshelf the minute he told me it was his favorite and began reading it immediately.   On page 12 of my Penguin edition, there is a quote which I have already underlined. Though Steinbeck wrote it about the people of Salinas Valley in California, the minute I read it it elucidated something about David's character that I had not previously been able to describe:    I think that because they trusted themselves and respected themselves as individuals, because they knew beyond doubt that they were valuable...because of this they could give God their own courage and dignity and then receive it back.    In short, as I begin the crazy, joy-filled slide of falling in love, I am realizing the inestimable value of what it is that I have found:   A person who's brave enough to catch me.

      In yet another moment of genius, last night over martinis Emily proclaimed the following:   "There are two ways to love a penis."  Emily is like The Buddha.    Because Emily and I have been friends for almost eight years now, it shouldn't surprise me when she brings forth these jewels of wisdom.  By now I should be accustomed to her sage proclamations, and should just grab a scroll, write them down, burn some incense, and find a village boy to rub her belly. (Her belly, by the way, which is flat, toned, and has an awesome six-pack.  Kind of a belly-cross between the bellies of "Giselle Bundchen" and "Anna Kornikova."  I feel sure she would want me to clarify.)  Anyway, as Emily sat there, perched on her bar stool, looking at me knowingly from over the top of her Mangotini, I knew she had just hit on something big.  Suddenly all was light and illumination: There  are  two ways to love a penis.   But the innocent Kathryn did not entirely grasp the meaning of Emily's great wisdom.  Kathryn placed another Mangotini before Emily and entreated her to take it.  Emily smiled and began to drink the Mangotini, thenceforth to be called The Nectar Which Brought Forth The Great Penis Epiphany And That Also Happens To Come With A Cool Little Teeny Plastic Mermaid Hanging Off The Rim.    Emily sat in a meditative mood.    "You can love the penis," said Emily, "because you love the man that it is attached to."    "Or," Emily continued, "you can love the penis as a penis itself.  As an entity separate from the man."     This, indeed, is the noble truth.  And Emily is the best friend ever.

      David has a girl friend.   Actually, he has several.  Several female friends that call him and bring their boyfriends along and they all hang out and drink, and it's fun and just like a scene right out of  St. Elmo's Fire  only none of the women look anything like Demi Moore did in that movie, thank God, 'cause if they did I would have to follow them into the bathroom and go ape-shit on their ass.   So.   He has several female friends like  that .    And then he has another, more specific kind of female friend.  His  single  female friend who  he  thinks of as A Super Fantastic 'Ole Buddy 'Ole Pal Give Her A Chuck On The Shoulder And Let's Go Have A Beer kind of friend.  Who, in turn, thinks of  him ...  Naked.    And I knew it the minute I met her.    It's amazing how we women can read one another when it comes to men.  And as soon as I saw her give me The Tight Smile/Cooly Assessing Once-Over Combo, I knew exactly what I was dealing with:     Not to be confused with her more aggressive and threatening cousin The Fuck Buddy, The Gal Pal is so-named because she reminds the majority of males in her tribe of their younger siblings.    Distinctly territorial, the resident female Gal Pal's senses are attuned to any sign of invasion by foreign females.  At the first scent of a threatening intruder, the Gal Pal will often become increasingly needy.  At this time, bystanders can observe her employing one of several highly evolved defense mechanisms.  These may vary depending on Gal Pal species.  In the wild, The Gal Pal displays an astonishingly varied plumage, ranging from baseball caps (SEE: WNBA Gal Pal) to Prada heels (SEE: Bitchy Manhattan Junior League Gal Pal).  Found in urban and rural settings round the globe, scientists are continually adding new species to the Gal Pal phylum.  Though by no means a complete list, the following represent a few samples of known species and their identifying characteristics.  WNBA Gal Pal: Known to sit for as many as five hours at a time while watching the males in her group run around in parks, the WNBA Gal Pal is often herself adept at video games, drinking, and sports talk.    The Simpering Gal Pal: May display a marked sensitivity to climate conditions and/or physical ailments, thereby demanding that every male in her immediate vicinity devote his entire attention to making her comfortable. The Simpering Gal Pal can be easily identified by the man's jacket she almost always asks to borrow.   The College-Friend Gal Pal: Can be recognized by her unmistakeable warning call, an incessant series of verbal anecdotes, most commonly identified by their opening line: "Remember the time when we...."  This call is among the College-Friend Gal Pal's most sophisticated defense tactics.  Though, to listening males, her throaty call merely evokes memories of times long past, any female within hearing range will hear the C-F Gal Pal's true message--a message that scientists have translated roughly to, "Back the fuck off, Bitch.  You're messing with my baby's daddy."  The most dangerous member of the Gal Pal Family, the Ex-Girlfriend Turned Gal Pal Gal Pal, should be avoided at all costs.  Frequently found delivering fake compliments on your outfit, the EGTGP GP can also be recognized because you've seen her face in way too many of your boyfriend's old pictures.  Additionally, the EGTGP GP will seem to ALWAYS have her hand on your man's arm.  TREAT THIS ANIMAL WITH CAUTION.  Set her up with your single male friends immediately.  The Ex-Girlfriend Turned Gal Pal Gal Pal can be easily killed with kindness.         David's friend is a GP of a kind I have not encountered before.  She is a DC Gal Pal, which means that she is always asking me questions about who my Congressmen is.  And, when she found out I was from Wisconsin, she immediately jumped on me with questions about the current Senators (Luckily, it's been the same two men for years) and their political leanings.    I found it annoying.  Manhattan GP's are more about handbags and shoes, for the most part.  And though this political line of questioning is obviously more worthwhile, I have found it distinctly LESS fun to sit around a computer all week, brushing up on state capitols and (just in case she goes totally psycho) state birds.     Though she is decidedly harmless, I think life would be easier if she had someone of her own to complain about the temperature to.    So, the solution here is obvious.    I'm going to set her up with my brother ASAP.

      Book suggestions?    I'm stuck in an apartment building again today and tomorrow, and have read all of the shitty Patricia Cornwell paperbacks that the other agent has left there.    Patricia Cornwell.    god.  So give me suggestions.  Non-fiction would be especially appreciated, as finding out more about real issues in the real world might help to keep my brain from eating itself out of boredom.  Much appreciated.

      I think the first love letter I ever knew of was probably Beethoven's to his Immortal Beloved. The signature at the end:   "ever thine ever mine ever ours,"   moved  me.  And then I discovered e.e. cummings.    Then Rilke.    However, lest you think that I was some sort of precocious, affected, literary nerd who did things like read "Les Miserables" in the sixth grade--Well.   Huh.    So, I  was  a precocious, affected ten year-old literary nerd carrying around Victor Hugo on her bookpile, mooning over love letters written by dead men with crazy hair.   BUT  let me reassure you that that did  not  stop me from running to the library with the rest of the remedial readers to tear through  Flowers In the Attic  looking for the sex scene.  Nor did it stop me from worshipping every adjective (and  Christ  there are a lot of them)that dripped from the pen of one,   Robert.   James.   Waller.  Yes.  It is fair to say that my teen years were heavily influenced by  The Bridges of Madison County .  I wrote a lot about peregrines and being alone in a great storm.  I filled entire notebooks with letters to Eric Ostermahn, who I knew for two weeks but loved with a certainty that comes but once in a lifetime. (He got in and out of his car  Dukes of Hazard  style through the driver's side window, and tried to play various musical instruments with his feet. We all knew I was That Girl already, so no one act surprised.)  ANYway, since my discovery of the love letter as a form of communication, I have received several amorous missives (fewer than 5) from various boyfriends (mostly just the last 2).  And my best friend, Emily, has also received a number (entire filefolders full) from various boyfriends (and one boy for whom the term "boyfriend" should be understood to mean "hot wanna-be rockstar with huge dick and awe-inspiring penchant for oral sex.")   So , in effect, between the two of us, Emily and I have collected an entirely un-random sampling of writing--some intended to actually  be  understood as letters conveying love, and some just written as drunken e-mails--from fewer than ten men.    Well, we all know what this means.    Because, here at Bellow we do not adhere to scientific standards or the rules for proper sociological study (we are not, after all, scientists or sociologists, but, instead, just Gorgeous Wonderful Beauty-Queen-Looks-Coupled-With-Nobel-Laureate-Brains-Who-Love-Being-Observant-But-Don't-Necessarily-Care-Whether-Or-Not-We-Are-Being-Entirely-Accurate Kind of People) I feel that is safe to say that we have now conducted a thorough investigation into the topic of love letters.  As such, we can now make several very broad generalizations about love letters and the men who write them.    *Everyone jumps up and down excitedly*   Let us begin.  A love letter should never contain the word "poo."    Even if said note may not actually have been written as a love letter  per se , it was still written to a woman with whom the writer was intimately involved, and, therefore, should NOT under any circumstances that I can think of, have contained either "poo," "poo-ey," or any other derivations of words pertaining to human excrement. Even the fact that it was preceded by the sentence "Sexual relations with you last night were yummy"--which is kind of cute when coupled with the knowledge that the writer of these lines possessed a penis the size of an oak--does not make up for the use of "poo."  And though the author is a confirmed recipient of the little talked about "I Break For Pussy" Boy Scout Honor Badge, his use of "poo" is  still  unacceptable.  Though a little less so.  Because that's one hell of a rare honor badge/penis-size combo.  So, on some level, who cares if he can write.  Which, I guess, was the conclusion that Emily came to.  Proving to us all, once again, that Emily is wise beyond her years.  Anyway.  As usual, I digress.  Bottom line: If you really cannot muster up anything appropriate for ages 3 and up in the way of love letters, I would suggest just going full force back into your pre-school days.  Forget love letters and resort to crafts.  Get out the paste.  Make her an Oscar the Grouch Christmas Ornament with a spool of thread and a green pom pon. She'll keel over from love.  Unless she's Jewish.  In which case, a popsicle stick menorah? Something like that.  You'll figure it out.   In direct contrast to the immature, poo-reference containing love letter, Emily's collection also contains a love-letter specimen that I think represents an error  commonly made by those attempting to craft romantic prose.  We shall refer to this type of letter as  The Ok, New Rule: You Can't Use The Word 'Doth' Unless You're In A Play That Also Requires You To Use The Word 'Codpiece'  Love Letter.  I just spent an hour trying to recreate one of this guy's letters here, and I can't do it.  I'm just not that good.  Suffice it to say that he  actually  used the phrase "you bestow grace upon me" and later went on to mention either St. Francis of Assisi or St. Thomas Aquinas.  I can't remember which.  Either way:   Many un-sexy things can be made to be sexy, given the right treatment.  Catholic Saints are so not one of these, that I almost want to grab the author of these letters by the head and give him a noogie just for trying.  Though, I suppose, that kind of summarizes the plight of the man for whom St. Thomas Aquinas represents romantic love: his life will probably be filled with noogies, but he'll never get laid.    Now.  On to my love-letter collection.  Let's see.  There's the post card my first boyfriend out of college, Dan, sent   when he was on a two-week long bed and breakfast vacation in Seattle with his MOTHER, that I was not invited to, because the two of them needed time together, since they were each other's self-described SOUL MATES.  The self-same post card--one, as in "single," as in "only"--that he HAD to write to me because the hotels they were staying in were so intimate that they DIDN'T EVEN HAVE PHONES  .    There's  that  post card. (The lesson learned there, I think, is obvious: I am an idiot for ever dating anyone who referred to their mother as their soul mate in the first place.)  There are the e-mails that S wrote in an attempt to heal his oh-so-bruised ego.  They read like a scene from one of his movies and included such pompous statements as, "I know you don't want to lose me."  Unbelievable what an ego that man had.  It boggles the mind.  And now?  And now.    There is an ever-expanding collection of what can only be called, "The Real Thing."    Funny, romantic notes slipped into my suitcase.  Newspaper articles he's read that he thinks I'll enjoy, popping up in my mail box unexpectedly with little notes scrawled across the top.  Six postcards from his recent trip to Europe.  All of them, silly and lovely and dirty and crazy.  Witty.  And tender.  And--sorry, guys 'cause you know I love to share--  And private.

      Shooting Monday-Wednesday of next week, and for five days every month after that.  Can't tell you what it is. Surely the network wouldn't approve of their host sharing her bikini waxes with the world. Sorry. But, never fear, it's not Fox. Nor is it Adult On Demand.  Job involves travel--I am, in fact, to be a travel journalist of sorts--so perhaps we'll do a test of bikini wax places 'round the Northeast. Rest assured, I will still be posting. And when I'm not posting, I will still be running around like a maniac, thinking to myself, "Must blog about that."  Best thing about the job so far: they pay for my haircuts/colors. Men may think that's not very exciting, but most women readers are probably currently jumping up and down. Add to that A CLOTHING ALLOWANCE. Add to that the fact that I GET TO KEEP THE CLOTHES. I feel like Kelly Ripa. Only not nearly so annoying.  Worst thing about the job so far: they're making me cut my hair. The hair that I have been growing for a year. The hair that has been so difficult to grow out that my roommate covered our refrigerator with pictures of Charlize Theron's long hair, so that I would wake up every day to motivation. I am sad about the haircut. But, only just a little.  Potential worst thing about the job: the camera and the ten pounds it totally really absolutely  does  add. Sucks. But, as of yet I'm still in denial. Ten pounds? What ten pounds?  I'm going to go have an ice cream cone.  Oh. Also, David is taking me to Prague.  All in all:  WHAT A FUCKING GOOD WEEK!     Thanks for the luck.  Apologies to all of the rabbits.
