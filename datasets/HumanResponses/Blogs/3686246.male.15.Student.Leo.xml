      Well this Saturday will be the day the form 5's and form 3's will retire from their respective posts. It is the end of the scouting term for the form 5's but one thing is it's not the end of their scouting life and their love for VSG. Recalling the previous seniors that had retire since 1933... they would always spend time and lend a helping hand to the troop eventhough they had already retire... you may ask just why do they always come back to see us??? why do they still come and teach us??? why?? why?? why??? there's only one answer to this... it's because they love the troop... this is the kind of spirit of VSGians past and present. but now... the spirit of VSG is falling.... why is this happening.... the scout den is beginning to be more and more empty....just one word as the answer to this... 'commitment'... without it boyscouts won't bother to come... 2nd ...'unity'... if ur frenz dun't go, u dun't go.... what's all this?? Boyscouts should show full commitment to the troop and also be united as one so that you'll make the troop a better place... To all the future PL and PS of the troop... lead the troop well... don't let it fall but let it rise... be united becoz... united we stand divided we fall... and when u go through an activity always remember ' if it doesn't kill you, it makes u stronger'... this is my last word to all the future PL and PS... b4 we, the PL and PS of year 03/04 retire... we wish u'll good luck and take care of the troop... remember what we thought you and alwayz remain       -second to none-
