         In our youth, we have all at one time or another wanted to be special agents. We have also been turned away by the amount of dedication it demands to become such a super-cool persona as these men and women are often depicted. But did we ever really know how much of a mind bending experience it could be just to get in?     The Recruit follows James Clayton's (Colin Farrell) journey through the CIA. We follow him through his recruitment by Walter Burke (Al Pacino), the head recruitment officer for the CIA and also the lead instructor for new trainees. Burke starts his stakeout at the wiz kid's MIT convention where Clayton is showing his newest computer invention, "Spartacus." From there, Burke follows him to his job at a bar, and that is when he strikes. Burke brings up the topic of Clayton's father and with a literal use of a little magic, sparks Clayton's curiosity.     Clayton's piqued interest stems from the fact that his father died in a helicopter crash over Peru in 1990 and no one seems to know why. After taking Burke's bait, Clayton goes to the CIA to start testing. Through this diagnostic analysis at the CIA we are allowed to see his perfections as an agent in training. He has all the perfect, dismissive answers for the psychology inquiry, and is arrogant about taking the written test. Once this testing is through, Clayton and all the other recruits who made it are ushered onto a bus and taken to “The Farm.” This is where they will learn how to be the stealthy, death-defying agents that we see in Bond flicks every other year.     As one would expect, Clayton is one of the best in his class, but is set up for failure by his own teacher. We all assume that Clayton will pass every challenge; because of the way he handled the CIA testing and the manner with which he has presented himself thus far. That is why it is a shock when things go wrong and Burke starts playing games with Clayton. During the recruitment process, Clayton had befriended another agent-in-training, Layla Moore (Bridget Moynahan). She is the cause for his arrogance throughout the written test and eventually is the reason for his downfall at “The Farm.” Burke uses Layla to taunt and test Clayton throughout his training.     After Clayton is kicked off "The Farm" for cracking under pressure during an interrogation, he is given a cheap hotel room for the night. Depressed because of his failure, he spends the evening drinking himself into a stupor. But little does he know Burke has plans of his own. The following morning Burke shows up and offers Clayton a position as a member of the elite CIA. He then produces a packet of information containing the mission Clayton will embark on. According to Burke's evidence, Layla Moore is a double agent and it will be Clayton's job throughout the remainder of the film to expunge her.&nbsp;&nbsp;       The cast of The Recruit has great chemistry. Colin Farrell is on top of his game, giving us a real glimpse into the mindset of a CIA agent. He demonstrates the paranoia and determination to please that we often do not see in these character types. In one scene he hopes to please Burke by using his formidable physical techniques during a bug-planting exercise, and in the next he is questioning everything around him as being a test. The camera adds to this paranoia by doing extreme close-up shots for almost every encounter with Farrell. This draws the audience into the deceptive web around Clayton and creates a sense of unease for the viewer. It is typically difficult to watch a movie featuring excessive close-ups, but when it is done right it creates the stifling atmosphere experienced here.     As for Pacino, this role is a significant improvement over the sentimental, tortured-soul cop he played in Insomnia. The "hardass" nature of the CIA suites his persona and accompanies his physical presence as well. He plays the double man masterfully. You never know where he stands, whether he is a good or bad guy. He is always in the gray. One moment he acts like Clayton's buddy, and the next he is chewing him out for getting caught during a test. Pacino does a decent enough job, but he has not yet found his comeback niche.     And as for our up-and-coming star Bridget Moynahan, she was commendable. Considering her film roots, she has really grown. Moynahan went from a 90's chick flick, Coyote Ugly, to a sappy love story, Serendipity, and has possibly found her home in the action/suspense/thrillers, starring recently in The Sum of All Fears as well as this film. She is beautiful and can actually put on a competent performance. She does not have anything lined up as of yet, but keep an eye out for her. This combination of looks and talent would be a waste to miss.     The Recruit revisits familiar themes of spy and cop thrillers. Who can you trust in this world of terrorists and dictators? What side are you on and who is the guilty party? What if the lines were blurred and you did not know good from evil? The whole essence of this film is built on mystery and trust. &nbsp;      Australian native, Roger Donaldson (Thirteen Days, The Bounty), has picked up a knack for political intrigue. He moves away from the historical angle and into psychologically driven action with The Recruit. Using his adept sense for paranoia, he opens the film with a montage of hazy computer screens, showing us information on someone named Clayton. We see a shady figure, which we recognize as Al Pacino, sitting behind one of these computers. After the montage has ended, we are given an eerie overlapping of Pacino and Farrell (Pacino on the left, Farrell on the right). We are left in the dark. This montage sets the mood for the restricted areas we will enter while following Clayton.     Klaus Badelt (K-19: The Widowmaker, The Time Machine) composes a score that parallels the very backbone of this film. In the theatre the score is powerful, demanding, and beautiful, fitting each scene like a glove, but once you have left, it is easily forgettable. The composition becomes like the agents themselves. It exudes power and seems manipulative, but easy to forget once you are out of its presence. It serves its purpose. &nbsp;      The Recruit breaks onto this current desolate mainstream wasteland and gives the viewer something worth spending their dollar on. The very fact that the film distorts our sense of right and wrong provides a great philosophical outlet for those wanting to expand their minds. It is filled with elaborate plot twists that keep you guessing until the last second. Overall the film was a meritorious attempt at a quality CIA suspense thriller. I was rewarded in the end and I left the theatre smiling, feeling that my $5.50 was well spent.     Entertainment:&nbsp; B    Artistic:&nbsp;&nbsp; B    Overall:&nbsp;&nbsp; B
