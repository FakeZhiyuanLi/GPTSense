						   No preachy thoughts today. I'm tired, but I have had my favorite joke on my brain all day so I thought I'd share it. This joke does not fall into the category of crude, at least I hope it doesn't. It's a joke dependent upon your ability to read with an Irish accent... basically trill your "r's" and vary your inflection and you're on your way. Here goes.  An older Irish gentleman stepped off of the ship and placed his foot on American soil for the first time. It was early summer many years ago, and as the ship sailed into the harbor our hero promised himself that he would, on his first day in his new home, do something uniquely American. As he walked the streets of New York, he came upon an amazing structure... it read "Yankee Stadium". A smile crossed his lips, and he had found the days activity. He bought his ticket and followed the crowd in to their seats.  As he sat in the crowd, it dawned on him that he had no clue how this game was played... he had never even seen it, only heard about it. The solution came to him quickly - watch the folks around you and do as they do. After all, "When in Rome". The first batter stepped to the plate, the pitcher wound up and released the ball... "CRACK"! The crowd leapt to their feet cheering the runner toward first. Our hero followed suit - "Run, run ye varmint! Run will ye?!?!?" A few of his neighbors snickered at his exuberance, but all in all his first game was going well. The next batter stepped up, and after 3 or 4 pitches the sound of the ball and bat colliding once again drove the crowd to their feet. "Run!!! Run ye varmint! Run will ye?!" The Irishman was having the time of his life... his fellow onlookers had caught some of his enthusiasm and seemed to enjoy the game all the more, partly because he was there.  Then the third batter stepped to the plate. Pitch after pitch crossed before him, until finally the umpire signaled him to take his base. The crowd applauded politely as the man began a half trot, half walk towards first... all of the crowd, that is, except our hero. He was dumbfounded. He leapt to his feet - "RUN!!! RUN YE VARMINT!!!". Snickers from the crowd, and a look of bewilderment on the Irishman's face. He slumped into his seat, trying to sort out what had just happened when a kindly neighbor leaned over to explain the situation. "He doesn't have to run," the kindly man said, "he's got four balls." The Irishman's gaze fell away from the fellow fan to the field, he rose to his feet and uttered these simple words: "Walk with pride, man. Walk with pride."  There you have it... my favorite joke ever. I cried the first time I read it... but somehow my version is always considerably longer. At least my embellishments in this version left out the smell of hotdogs and freshly cut grass. This has brought a smile to my face all day - not sure what made me think of it, but I'm thankful for it today.  Grace &amp; Peace,  PJ

						   I've spent the better part of my adult life convinced that I was supposed to be in worship ministry, or at very least in some role that made a sizeable impact on the Kingdom.  That sense of calling has been my life preserver at times, but has at times been the stone dragging me at break-neck speed towards the bottom of the lake.   Without going into great detail on this, I am in a hard season with some of God's children... I feel like I've been beaten up, left and then beaten again.  I ended up in this situation because of my compelling need to make sweeping contributions to the Kingdom - this would be a stone situation.  I felt I could bring the gifts and talents given me by God into a notoriously hard working environment and change everything and everyone there for the good of the Kingdom.  I got in there, worked as hard as I could and tried to serve to the best of my ability; I can honestly say that I gave my best out of what I thought were Holy intentions, but here I sit with my feelings hurt and my reputation on the line.  What went wrong?  Re-read that last paragraph and notice how many "my's" and "I's" are there.   I  thought that  I  could effect change...  my  calling was to take  my  gifts and talents.  I'm finding the link between when the notion of God's call and annointing over me serves as life-preserver or stone has everything to do with... well... me.  Specifically, I am finding that when I go into opportunities with my own great plans and agendas things quickly begin crumbling around me.   Here's the challenge:  I want to be a part of the body of Christ but I have always approached my life as though it were my calling to be the twinkle in the eye of Christ.  I am naturally given to arrogance, and I confess that here for all to read, but this belief was , at least in my mind, Holy.  I was supposed to be the tool with which God would bring sweeping change and revival to His people!  As it stands now, I am not God's secret weapon... what a painful discovery.  What I am learning through this time is simply this:  if all I am ever given to serve as is a callous on the foot of Christ's presence in this world then I am blessed.  I don't have to be the ring finger or the sparkle in the eye to be a part that is necessary and beautiful.  God knows me - he knows what he made me to be and that is enough.  I can't make myself more than I was created to be, but no one can take my place in the body away from me.  Grace & Peace,  PJ

						   Refresh my memory - could Jeckyl remember the atrocities of Hyde? In the spirit of confession, I never quite got around to reading this classic in school... Nor do I remember reading the Cliff's notes. I would say that I relied on the movie, but I never remember getting around to watching it either... come to think of it, how did I ever graduate? I digress. There's a theme in these horror classics in which a transformation takes place (Werewolf, Jeckyl & Hyde, the Hulk... Michael Jackson) where a "what have I done" moment inevitably follows "the change".  I can relate to the monsters in those stories a little bit... okay, a lot bit. I am one of those guys who can be just fine one minute and then something is said or takes place that absolutely sets me off. Contrast this with Jack (my son). The boy can be smiling and giggling up a storm one minute and them BAM! (all props to Emeril), the boy is screaming like mad. Fast forward ten minutes, though, and big boy is asleep or smiling again with no recognizable sign that he was ever upset. I always have the "What did I say or do?" moments that follow these outbursts, but Jack is ready to be loved on and played with again almost immediately. So here's the question: when does the change take place and why?  Hypothesis: Jack screams because he has a need that he can't communicate in any other way. Once the need is met, the time of need is past and it's playtime. When I go off the deep end, it's more often than not overflow - too many annoyances and challenges have built up and I'm off. If I'm not careful this blog could get crazy long, so I'll go straight to the point: We are called to be like children, and that has a great many implications, but this one is new to me. The difference between me and my boy is this: he recognizes need as need and I bury my needs under a stack of wants and "I deserves". Jack's day is made by being loved, being fed and being sheltered, whereas mine is ruined if I don't get all of those things  plus  affirmation from my boss, my wife's undivided attention, the blessings from God I so richly deserve... the list goes on.  What would my life look like if I was able to approach my day with the knowledge that before my feet ever touch the floor my needs have been met? What if, instead of living and dying from sale to sale (or failure to failure) I rested in the promises of God and took the time to watch the birds of the air and notice the flowers of the field? This is  not  to say that I need not work and "provide" for my family, rather to say that I should recognize that my NEEDS are met. You can see how this could get lengthy, so I'll leave you to stew on that instead of trying to say it in ten other ways, as is my want (certainly not your need, however).  I don't expect that I will master this any time soon, but I do believe that there is a lesson to be learned here. HIS divine power has given us everything we need for life... for I know the plans I have for you says the Lord... you have been given a spirit not of slavehood, but of children - and THAT IS WHAT WE ARE - children of the most high God. I love the fact that my boy gets it, and I pray that he will help me recognize my needs under that pile of rubble the world tells me I "need". Cue Fernando Ortega's "Give Me Jesus"... I'm out.  Grace &amp; Peace~  PJ

						   Okay... maybe not Waterloo, but it was close.  Picture it (Golden Girls reference there... Sophia is hysterical): Walgreens on a sticky Friday evening in August. A beautiful woman comes bounding down the toy isle toward an unsuspecting new father as he struggles to hold the child/car seat combo (see "ton of bricks") off of the nasty drug store floor. In her hands she carries them... the downfall of many a father's dreams, the scourge of the never-to-be future quarterback... the Care Bear. Ladies and gentlemen, I confess to you that my son is the owner of a Care Bear - Good Luck Bear as I am told. He has that one because there is a big shamrock on the front. If my boy is to grow up confused I can pray that he thinks we are Notre dame fans! Alas, I was defeated. You will be happy to know, however, that when Mama started talking about busting out the little boy Cabbage Patch demons the foot came down. Negative ghost rider, the somewhat-less-than-manly toy pattern is full.  Hallelujah for the weekend. Jack can holler all he wants tonight, because I can sleep until the Spirit moves me in the morning. If, however, he were to sleep all night but wake up at 6:00 a.m. I would be bitter... I don't want to see the clock until at least 9:00.  I have no profound wisdom for the blog today... some would say that is nothing new. I tried hard to see my world afresh today and had a few victories but many defeats. I just try to keep reminding myself to lift up my eyes. Strange that we are called to look away from the next step and lift our hands away from what "holds us down". Lay everything at His feet, turn your eyes toward Jesus and... well, when I develop the faith to try it for myself I'll tell you all about it. As a friend often says, you can't lead where you have not yet been. The first few steps down that road have been interesting - thanks for joining me on the journey.  Grace &amp; Peace,  PJ

						   Have you ever seen a baby pinecone? I was at Cumberland University today, trying like the dickens to sell some phones so that I can buy fun stuff for our 17-week old... and maybe a little sump'in sump'in for me (ncaa 2005 on the ps2). I was walking out with my boss after a so-so meeting and there it was - a tree full of baby pinecones. Who knew? I remember playing with them as a kid, my mom sitting them beside the fireplace... even kicking them around the yard (a poor man's soccer ball, if you will). Never, though, do I remember seeing baby pinecones.  Baby pinecones are plenty cool, but they are nothing compared to my little man. As I said, he is seventeen weeks old and is changing every day. His smiles are radiant, his eyes are as big and bright as the sky and his laugh is infectious. He is the coolest thing in the history of ever, period. Here's my fear, though: It has taken me the better part of seven years of marriage to figure out how amazing and beautiful my wife is, and I am learning that more every day. How can I, working 40+ hours a week, stressing over sales numbers and bills, insure that I will not look up years from now and be shocked to find my little man... well... a man? How can I not glance up from "keeping my head down" or "my nose to the grindstone" years from now and not find that I missed everything?  Final part of this thought: the same thing has happened in my walk with God. I lived 20+ years of life singing songs and attending services, all the while missing the bright, shining face of my Lord looking down on me - His child... his chosen. I was so busy watching for His hands to move that I never stopped to look up into His eyes. I love it when Jack looks at me and his face lights up in a huge smile. I love coming home in the afternoons and seeing my wife at the back door, babe in arms waiting for me to come in and give her a "hoogle" (better known as a hug). I love the notion of the God of creation singing over me and smiling as he watches me rock my son. My prayer is that my eyes will seek out the precious things God has put in my life and take them in fully.  I kind of like the fact that at 27 I am amazed at the sight of a baby pinecone... it makes me wonder what new sight awaits me tomorrow.
