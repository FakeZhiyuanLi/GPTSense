      My DSL gets connected next week and I will finally be able to show a little more internet love to my faithfull readers.  Lets see... Who else reads this blog besides me...  Oh yeah... I'm the only faithfull reader out there.  Wow thats lame.  Wait, if no one else is reading this, who am I writing this to.  I'm basiclly talking to myself.  I think talking to oneself is a sign of intelligence... or insanity.  Either way, I'm good.

      I hate people.  This week some a-hole decided to try and steal my car.  Ok, first of all... Why in the name of everything holy would anyone want to steal a POS car like mine.  I mean come on!  My car sucks.  The bumper is all smashed in and the wheels are about to fall off.  If you're going to the trouble to steal a car don't you think it should at least be nice!  So this moron who who broke into my car broke the ignition cover and tried to start it with a screw driver, like thats going to work.  He did manage to steal a few CD's and the spare change in my cup holder.  I hope those scratched CD's and dollar fifity make you happy Mr. robber guy... Schmuck.

      I love Technology.  I got an iPod this this past weekend, and it is the coolest.  So far I only have 3 GB's of music (about 700) songs, but with a 5,000 song capacity, I'm just geting started.  I love being a geek.

      Wow, I am so incredibly tired today.  I stayed up playing guitar last night untill 12:30... ON A SCHOOL NIGHT!  Nobody tell my mom.  I would have kept playing even later, but my fingers were so torn up that they were litteraly close to bleeding.  Now that is some hard core rockin.  A funny side note boys and girls, does anyone know why I started playing guitar some nine years ago?  No?!?  I, like so many other teenage boys, had this great idea that if I learned to play the gee-tar, I would be more attractive to the ladies.  Unfortunately every fifteen year old had the exact same idea.  So how many chicks did I get because of my hard rocking guitar abilities?  Let's see, there was one, two, three.....  Uh,  Zero!  Yeah thats right.  Zip, nonthing, nada.  It turns out that pudgy 15 year olds with bad hair will never be chick magnets, no matter how good at guitar they are.  So the moral of this little tale?  Don't try.  If you're like me, you can't win anyway, no matter what you do, so give up now.  Hey, I should be a motivational speaker!  I have an incredible ability to get completely off subject and just start running with it.  ADD much?

      I think my cell phone is trying to kill me.  When i went to pick it up this morning it shocked me, for no reason.  Maybe my phones gone all renegade, matrix style, and it wants to enslave humanity, and turn us into human batteries, which is ironic seeing as the main component of a cell phone is a battery, and oh my gosh this has turned into the longest run on sentence in the world, somebody please stop me.... Phew.  That was close.  I thought I was doomed to writing an infinite run-on sentence for the rest of eternity.  Hello, melodramatic much.  Sorry, I get carried away.  Anyhoo, I've sat here typing for about five minutes, and have managed to say absolutely nothing.  I love you internet.  Even when no one else will listen to my incesant ramblings, you are always there.  Damn I'm pathetic... and shouldn't I be working right now?

      This is my blog...  My blog is pretty boring.  Luckily, I have no friends so no one wil read it and get bored.  I'm bored right now.  I have to go to Ron and Debbies after work to pick up my computer.  I hope they are not home.  Maybe then I can escape without getting asked about 7 billion questions.  I hate questions.  If i was never asked another question again for the rest of my life, that would be okay.  I wish I could meet the guy (or girl more likely) who invented the question, because I would kick their ass!  Anyway, to make a long story even longer, I think people should just mind their own business... Except for me, because I am crazy nosey.  I get to ask all the questions I want.  Doulble standard anyone?  Yes please!

      Last night was one of the strangest, and coolest nights in my life.  But to better understand last night, I will start with the events leading up to last night.   So yesterday started off like any normal Sunday, I got up, went to church, yadda yadda yadda.  So after church is over, I was eating lunch with my parents in the atrium, when DeeDee and some other people from Scope come over to our table to talk.  Then DeeDee introduces me to Hallie.  Hallie is a 22 year old theatre major from South Dakota.  She just graduated, and is working at Kanakuk this summer, before moving to St. Louis in August.  Hallie is absolutly gorgeous.  Just to paint a mental picture, she is 5' 8", with long, curly red hair, porcelin skin, and an athletic build.  So my first impression was "Wow, this girl is hot!"  After talking for twenty minutes, I also realized that this girl was smart, funny, and really loved the Lord.  At this point though, I had only learned enough information to dismiss her as a possibility for future romantic entanglements.  I found out that she just broke up with her very serious boyfriend last month, after they had been dating more than a year.  Here is the kicker.  Her ex... is a proffesional baseball player!  Yep, he is a pitcher for the Atlanta Braves triple A team.  And apperantly he is supposed to go to the majors next year.  So that is a little intimidating.  I mean come on, he bought her a car for crying out loud, how am I supposed to compete with that?!?  So they broke up because he was putting baseball before their relationship, but more importantly, he was not a Christian.  Go her.  So she wants to move to St. Louis for the time being, and follow God, and see what he wants her to do with her life.    Ok, so after a couple hours at Ron and Debbie's it is time for Scope.  Scope went really great, Gary rocked the house as usual.  Halley was there, and we ended up talking some more.  So the reason Hallie even came to Grace was because her cousin goes, and DeeDee is good friends with her cousin.  So DeeDee knows that I have a thing for girls with curly hair, and so she decided to try and hook a brother up.  She set it up so we would all hang out, and then she would kinda disappear so I could get to know hallie one on one.  We chilled at Hallies cousins house, then DeeDee and the rest of the gang went home, but hallies cousin and I convinced her that we had to go to Ted Drews, so then we were right by my house, so the three of us went there to eat our ice cream.  We ended up singing Kareoke on the x-box for like three hours.  At some point her cousin fell asleep on the couch.  It was about one in the morning at this point, and me and Hallie basiclly decided to tell each other our entire life stories.  We talked for the next four hours!  It only seemed like a few minutes though.  We had one of those "Holy Crap!" moments when we realized it was five in the morning.  The birds outside had started chirping, and it had begun getting light outside.  I had a eureka moment, and said Hey, lets get on the roof and watch the sun rise!"  So we craweled outside onto the semi-wet roof, with blankets and pillows and watched the sun rise slowly behind the arch and downtown st. louis.  This was hands down one of the most romantic moments of my life.  In fact, I even told her that.  And guess what... She felt the same way.  She said it was like something out of a movie.  After the sun started rising, we continued to talk, and she said she needed to tell me something, but then decided she probably shouldn't.  I convinced her that she should tell me, so she did.  She basiclly said that after coming out of this relationship she promised her self she would take a break from dating to get closer to God.  However, if she was looking, I have all the qualities she is looking for in a guy, and she doesn't know what to do with that.  Then she apologized and said that was inapropriate, and she shouldn't have said anything.  So as we are laying there on the roof, I stare into her eyes and tell her that I feel the same way she does.  She smiles but gives me this look like "I want you to kiss me right now, but at the same time I don't".  I wanted to kiss her with every fiber of my being...  But I didn't.  And you know what, I'm glad.  There is no reason to rush anything.  I did that with corlyn, and look how that turned out.  So basicly we decided to keep in touch this summer, and see what happens in August.    Phwew... that was a lot of typing.  So basicly, I have known this girl for less than 24 hours, but I feel like we've been freinds forever.  This kind of thing doesn't ussually happen in real life.  I don't know man, I am totally infatuated with this girl... who I won't get to see again for two months.  CRAP!  But really, its probably a good thing.  I'm pretty ficle when it comes to this stuff.  It's not my fault though.  I'm not a player, I just crush alot.  We'll see what happens.

      I did absolutely nothing today.  Well, I did watch like five movies, so I guess thats something... But I didn't do anything constructive.  Isn't it great!  I completely wasted the entire day.  And even given the chance, I wouldn't have it any other way.  Do you know the greatest nation on earth?  The greatest nation is Procrastination.

      I'm sorry, but when you pay $5,000 to have a new air conditioning system installed, it should work longer than a month!  It is currently 87 degrees in my house.  I don't think you realize just how hot that is indoors.  It is so hot and sticky that you could be completely naked and still want to shoot your face off...  Because it is so freaking HOT!  I tossed and turned most of the night, untill a breeze started at around 3:30, and I was finally able to fall asleep.  Stupid Welsch Heating and Cooling!

      I saw this incredibly gorgous girl today.  I mean seriously, wowza.  Smokin hot!  So as to protect the innocent... ok... the guilty, she will remain anonymous.  For the sake of this post though we will call her KatieLee Prowler.  She was wearing this tight Pink top today... omigosh, it was all I could do to not jump on her right then and there.  Did I mention this girl was HOT!?!  I'm affraid to talk to her though.  She seems kinda into herself.  She would probably just string me along and then stomp on my heart when I was at my most vulnurable.  I've dealt with girls like this one before.  They are nothing but trouble.  I bet she might want to fool around though!

      So I was listening to my iPod last night, and this switchfoot song comes on. It's called "This is your life" and it seriously made me think about some really heavy stuff.  Just so we're all on the same page, here are the lyrics:  Yesterday is a wrinkle on your forehead Yesterday is a promise that you've broken Don't close your eyes, Don't close your eyes This is your life, and today is all you got now And today is all you'll ever have Don't close your eyes, Don't close your eyes This is your life, Are you who you want to be? And this is your life, is it everything you dreamed that it could be When the world was younger, and you had everything to lose Yesterday is a kid in the corner Yesterday is dead and over And this is your life are you who you want to be?  Wow... Does anyone else feel like crying after hearing that?  I feel like yesterday I was fifteen, and I closed my eyes, and suddenly I'm almost twenty-four.  What happened to the last eight years of my life.  It always seemed like I had all the time in the world, and suddenly its this huge slap in the face.  I've been so caught up looking ahead to the future that I missed the present.  Well I'm done.  The gloves are off.  I'm not sitting back going through life with cruise control on anymore.  My life is not everything that I dreamed it could be!  That changes right now.  I'm done trying to please people all the time, and I'm done being this scared little boy, who goes through life trying to avoid pain or discomfort at all cost.  One of my biggest fears has always been rejection.  Well screw that!  Life is way too freaking short.  My time here on this earth is already a quarter over and I haven't done squat.  This just isn't going to fly.

      Well the party is off!  Don't worry all of my party people.  The party isn't cancelled, just postponed.  Paul got stuck going to Pittsburg this week, so rather than me throwing a party by myself (which would have never worked) we are pushing the festivities back a week.  So all you party animals out there be ready, because on May 29th we are seriously going to throw down.  St. Louis may never be the same.  I just had a crazy idea!  This should be a theme party...  and since everyone was planning on spending the night anyway...  I've got it!  Pajama Party!  It's so crazy it just might work.  So here is the deal, it's a slumber party, so everyone wear your hottest PJ's and bring a sleeping bag.  I'll provide the food and alcohol.  (sorry, if you're under 21 no beer for you)  But if you still want to bring something, bring desert type stuff.  And as I mentioned before, we want to keep the testosterone level relatively low, seeing as the only reason for this party is so I can meet girls, so for every guy you bring, you must bring 2 girls.  Sorry, but thems are the breaks.  I'll keep everyone updated as Party day gets closer... Untill then,  "Party on Wayne..."  "Party on Garth..."  "SCHWING!!!"

      Ok, huge PARTY an my house next weekend!  Its going to be so huge that it will take us an entire week and a half to prepare.  So this party to end all parties will be on Saturday, May 22nd.  We're gonna start grilling at about 6:00, and the party won't stop "till eight in tha mo-nin!"  I thought I told ya that we won't stop, I thought I told ya that we won't stop.  So anyway, all my "peeps" are invited... Unless your name is Mark Hufton.  He can't come because I hate him.  If your name isn't Mark, feel free to come and bring a friend.  Wait, let me claify... bring a friend that is a. A female, and b. Is Hot.  The last thing we need is for this to turn into a sausage fest.  So I suggest everyone rest up this weekend and prepare for next.  And don't forget to bring your party ponchos.

      Well, contrary to rumor, Natalie did not drown me on the float trip and bury me in a shallow grave behind the local Denny's.  She tried, but luckily I was able to overpower her and escape.  I know kung-fu.  We did however have a blast on the trip, and can I just say, Natalie and I didn't dump our canoe once!  And that was with a sixty pound ball of energy named bodger doing his best to make us flip.  We are definately kick-ass!  I'm not gonna lie, Natalie looked smokin' hot this weekend.  I think that from now on bikini's should be standard business attire during the summer.  Oh, and hey I met a cute girl who is apparently not at all interested in me.  Way to burst my bubble nat... dick.  Girls just don't get it.  Sometimes all we want is for you to lie to us.  No really its cool!  Let us beleive whatever dellusional fantasy that gets us through the day.    Anyway, I should probably do some work today... or at least look like I'm doing something...

      So who is surprised that the skinny Olsen is anorexic.  Ok those of you who raised your hand, please e-mail me so I can come to your house and hit you in the head with a tack hammer, because you are retarded.  Seriously, have you seen that girl?  She looks like a skeleton wearing a suit made of a skin-like material.  For those of you who think that she must've had a rough life, with the pressure of fame and all, and deserves our sympathy... well you can cry me a frickin' river.  Yeah poor her, rough life and all... maybe she can be consoled by her, I don't, two billion dollars!  Yeah that's right.  After the twins turned 18 last week they both got control of their estimated 2.6 billion dollar net worth.  Yeah, that aint Full House money either!  You don't see Dave Coulier (uncle Joey) with no billion dollars.  They made all that bank pimping their straight to video movies on all those ten year old girls for the past fifteen years.  And do you know why they are so successful?  Because america is populated by a bunch of media whores.  Ralph Lauren could take a crap, wrap it in tin foil, put fishhooks on 'em, and call it earings, and Cameron Diaz would be wearing them on the red carpet by friday... as long as they said nice things about her new 'it' earings on the E! channel.  God! sometimes I hate this freaking country.

      I wanted to comment on yesterdays post.  I mentioned that my sister charis would probably be in a bitchy mood, yadda yadda.  Well, surprisingly that was far from the truth.  We had a great practice/meeting last night, and afterwards we had a civil dinner at Appleby's.  (On a side note, our waitress was flirting with me, and I was kinda flirting back.  So Charis and Paul told me I should write my number on the bill, but because I'm a big chicken I didn't.)  So we had a good time, and it made me realize that I do like my sister, and she is the coolest.  I'm glad we are friends.  I just hope she doesn't turn out like our aunt Suzy.

      So guess who has a really great singing voice?  Our good friend Paul Merlotti.  He is going to be the new male vocalist for Scope.  Does this mean that the old male vocalist, David, is dead to us?  Cause that would be super.  I would like to mention that a certain person I work with looked very attractive today.  I don't know what it is, you work with someone everyday, and you start to take for granted how beautiful they actually are.  So I just wanted to say keep up the good work... You know who you are.  But enough about brian, lets talk about the float trip Natalie and I are going on this weekend.  I am more than a little worried that I am going to have third degree burns from the sun come monday.  People as white as me shouldn't be allowed out in the sun without protective clothing and massive amounts of sunscreen.  Me on the beach is never good, it's like sticking a fork in the microwave, there's sparks and a lot of pain.  Oh well, maybe I'll fall in and drown instead.  That would be great!

      We have band practice tonight, and I really don't want to go.  Not because I don't enjoy band practice, but rather because of my sister (by the way, I'm in a band with my siter).  You see, she is what doctors call "off her rocker".  She has been trying to get pregnant for the last six months or so, and she has put so much pressure on herself to get pregnant right now, that its never going to happen.  She started taking this drug, clomid, again and it makes her so incredibly moody that you can hardly stand to be in a room with her.  While she's on this medicine I don't know how Chadd can stand being in a room with her long enough to make sandwich, let alone a baby, which in most cases takes a bit longer (or should, if you're doing it right).  It would serve her right if this clomid crap mede her have sextuplets or something.  Can you imagine Charis with six babies?!?  I don't know if she has the patience for one baby...  I mean she already has Chadd.  He's like having two or three kids... Have you met him?  So anyway, not too excited about being around the wicked witch (with a capital B) tonight.  Maybe if I wear all black and don't speak, she won't see me, and I'll avoid the verbal, and depending on her mood physical, abuse.

      I was thinking about work today, and how much I don't like doing any.  It's not that I'm lazy... well ok I am in fact lazy, but that's beside the point.  I thought I wanted a career, but it turns out that I just wanted a salary.  But while thinking about work I had a sobering thought:  What if at this very moment I am living up to my full potential?  That would suck!  I know I complain about it a lot, but in reality, I like my job.  Although I do sometimes wish I could try and find a new one, simply to screw with the guy doing the interviews.  For example, the next time I fill out a job application, on the "Anything Else" portion, I will write something like to this...  "I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing ice. I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy. I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees. Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once single-handedly defended a small village in the Amazon Basin from a horde of ferocious army ants. I don't perspire. Children trust me. I know the exact location of every food item in the supermarket. I have performed covert operations for the CIA. I sleep once a week. The laws of physics do not apply to me."  Then I will conduct the entire interview speaking in several foreign accents, alternating between them randomly.  If asked by the interviewer where I am from, i will tell him I was raised by wolves amoung the rolling hills of New Dehli.  If I have not been thrown out of the building by security at this point, I will ask my prospective employer if I can borrow an inordinate sum of money, in order to buy vast amounts of cheese.  This should be enough to ensure that I never work in this town again.    I came off a little crazy just then didn't I?  Yeah, this post was pretty lame.  Like a duck... and not the metaphorical lame duck either, but a real duck that was actually lame. Maybe from stepping on a land mine or something.

      Kids say the sweetest things!  First I'd like to welcome Natalie back to the blog... I still don't know why she left in the first place.    I'd also like to say hello to all the new readers who have e-mailed me recently, and liked the blog.  I'm glad people are finally starting to recognize me for the genius that I am.  This blog is but a spring-board on my path to... you guessed it, WORLD DOMINATION!  HWA Ha Ha Ha......  Wait, I'm far too lazy to rule the world.  People would want me to do stuf, and I'd have to talk to people... Nah, I think I'll settle on ruling the couch and remote for right now thanks.

      I find it a bit odd that when I mentioned that I wanted to start attending a different church, my entire family jumped at the idea.  I think they want to get rid of me.  Even my Dad thinks it's a good idea.  Oh well... There are other people in leadership at Scope who don't go to Grace, so I guess it isn't a problem.  Windsor is just so far away...  Damn I complain a lot.  Oh wait, that's why they invented the internet!

      I watched last comic standing last night on NBC.  Its amazing how you can rip off another show so completely, and not get your pants sued off.  Think American Idol, only instead of singing, really bad stand up comedy.  I wish I watched the new WB show with aunt Becky instead.    Mandy Moore has a new movie coming out this weekend, Saved!, in which she plays the "bad girl".  I'm not cool with the making fun of Christians part of this film, but Mandy could be in a movie about knitting and I'd probably still see it.  Natalie and I are working on a plan where somehow I marry Mandy Moore, and she marries Andy Rodick.  And then we become best friends with Brad and Jennier and live happily ever after.  Natalie world is GREAT!

      Umm, Natalie, Lizzie and Katy... Your blog has gotten really boring as of late.  I haven't had any news about the latest ABC Family movie in a week.  How is a guy supposed to get his celebrity gossip if you don't post?  Come on!  You have an obligation to the public to post more frequently.  So lets get it together people!

      Lets face it, when it comes to the fairer sex, I'm like as clueless as a retarded kid on the first day of school.  Wait that wasn't very politically correct... Ok, a mentally challenged individual, who is begining to attend school.  That's better.  I hate political correctness.  But even more than that, I hate those PETA whacko's.  Talk about people not having a clue.  If we aren't supposed to eat animals, then why are animals made out of meat?  Never thought about that one, did ya.  Anyway... How do I get so far off of what I'm talking about.  Sorry I have ADD, and I'm selfish.  They're pretty much the same thing.  It's like carte blanche to not have to listen to people.  It's great.  But I digress, again... Damnit!  So, ok, I'm retarded when it comes to women... er mentaly challenged, sorry.  After spending the entire weekend with a friend/girl I've decided that I should not be allowed to associate with women untill I'm married.  And yes I am aware that this policy will make finding a wife excedingly difficult.  But drastic measures must be taken!  I have a condition that doctors call "an abnormally high libido" or in other words, I'm an average male, so being around attractive women for more than 30 seconds at a time causes my brain to go all crazy like.  This in turn causes me to become completely delusional.  It's funny how hormones can turn an innocent jesture of friendship into "Omigod I think she wants to get a piece... SWEET!"  I've done this a lot lately, and it almost resulted in me kissing someone this weekend who I have no buisness kising... EVER!  Not that she is not totally hot, just completely wrong for me, and I wrong for her.  My inner dialoge while considering kissing her went something like this.  "Wait, no, I can't kiss her, it would ruin the friendship... Screw it, we aren't that good of friends anyway."  Too bad the girl in question is only like my best friend since sixth grade!  Are you starting to see what I'm saying.  I am addicted to the booty.  It's like crack, but more addictive and way more expensive (they always want you to buy them stuff. what's that?).  This is why I need to move to a dessert island and build a radio out of coconuts (just like the proffesor). Or on the other hand, God could just send me my wife and I wouldn't have this problem. ahem... hint hint God.  I'm sure I'm supposed to be learning some sort of lesson right now about life or something, but seriously... I'm so busy thinking about sex, or lack thereof, that I no longer have the cognitive capacity to learn crap.  So seriously God, throw me a bone here... No pun intended.  hehe, I said bone.  (shut up, you know you laughed too!)

      Our volunteer mary is retarded.  She decided to go joyriding in the ghetto, hoping out of her car to run down dark allys taking pictures.  "Hey, you... over there smoking crack.  Could you put down that knife and say cheese?"  Seriously!  My cat has more common sense than this lady.  Forget youth, we have plenty of that.  We need a fountain of smart!

      Well, I have a shed now.  It's roughly half the size of my entire house.  I'm quite confident that no fewer than three homeless guys will be living in the thing by the weekend.  And why not, the damn things so big it has its own address.  The utilities to the shed get hooked up tuesday.  I'm surprised it doesn't come with cable or internent connections.  Damn shed!

      I haven't blogged in a while.  Probably because my life is so boring that I have nothing to write about.  I am however excited about seeing harry potter this weekend on a screen that is as tall as the building where I work.  And the 15,000 watt sound system... I could be wrong but I think thats enough to power a small city.  Should be fun!    And a side note, how weird is it that my family and Natalie's family are going together?  You know, besides the whole being in love thing, me and Natalie are an old married couple.  God, if me and Natalie do get married, when I get up there I'm kicking some ass!
