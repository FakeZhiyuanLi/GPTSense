      sometimes the worst thing for me is doing laundry. seriously. as simple a thing as it is, sometimes it's just too heavy a  burden. i feel crushed under the wieght of two loads. most of the time my lack of discipline is the worst thing for me, as it tends to lead me  into depraved and regretfull scenerios. i won't elaborate here, but suffice it to say that i am constantly trying and failing to be a better human being. so sad.
and why is it that i no longer enjoy grocery shopping? i've found little joy in shopping for food in nearly a year now. shopping can be cool with someone with you.alone i have no desire for any of it. i almost don't care. two boxes of cereal loaded with oats/grains. two containers of rice milk, one vanilla, the other plain. one $5 salad. as i realize the cereal will last for  over a week, i begin to wander towards the checkout, glancing at everything hopfully, thinking that something may call out to me."zac, take me home! i am a delectible treat designed for your eating enjoyment alone!" alas i never hear this hopefull cry.  now near the register i realize that it would be wrong of me to leave without a bottle of  plum wine, and/or a riesling. i feel that if i shopped longer, i could have film developed whilst shopping. how slick would that be? very  i suspect.
the current work on my tattoo is healing nicely. riz is the shit! hopefully i can get some pictures of it up soon, though  i may need the help of a certain talented photographer......i can't wait to get it finished so  i can begin other work.
patience i have in abundance, now to use it.

       urlLink    i thought the texture the paint dried in was kind of interesting. i wish now that i had touched  it when i saw it. now i'll never know the tactile sense of dried spilled paint. well ok, at least not that spilled paint.....&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    this was in the same parking lot as the piles of trash. i didn't notice it untill i was driving away. sadly, i almost missed it. when i shot it, i thaught for sure my reflection would end up in the shot. i'm glad it didn't. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    this pile of somebody's trash was left in the middle of this huge parking lot. there was once a movie theater there, though  it had been torn down recently. there were several similar piles around. i'll post them if i find them.&nbsp; urlLink

      i hope to get as much of my photography on this site as possable. tattoos. graffitti. people. others art. plants. clouds for melissa because she's brilliant. my hands. my whims. my luck in life. if i can freely ramble to no end in this little corner of space,then perhaps i will. hopefully consistantly. if but some random chance you happen to be reading this, and you'd like to see something specific, please let me know. i believe that creativity can be such a wonderfully mutual engagment if only people share with one another. maybe one day i can get my music on here. maybe i 'll make it avialabe for 50 cents or so. maybe not.
will update frequently.  love to all. zac.
