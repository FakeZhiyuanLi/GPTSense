      I don't Wanna Live without Your Love - Chicago   Thought it wouldn't matter If we didn't stay together And if it was over Baby, it was for the better I was thinking I'd be all right 'Til I thought it all through Now I know that I ain't really living If I have to live without you  I don't wanna live without your love I don't wanna face the night alone I could never make it through my life If I had to make it on my own I don't wanna love nobody else I don't wanna find somebody new I don't wanna live without your love I just wanna live my life with you With you  Guess I had to go away So much I had to go through Guess I had to lose you To realize how much I love you Can we make the fires burn again? Burn a little stronger 'Cause I've been alone, and baby I can't be alone any longer  I don't wanna live without your love I don't wanna face the night alone I could never make it through my life If I had to make it on my own I don't wanna love nobody else I don't wanna find somebody new I don't wanna live without your love I just wanna live my life with you  If I had to make it on my own My life would never be the same My love would never be the same And I don't wanna live without your love  I don't wanna live without your love I don't wanna face the night alone I could never make it through my life If I had to make it on my own I don't wanna love nobody else I don't wanna find somebody new I don't wanna live without your love I just wanna live my life with you  I don't wanna live without your love I don't wanna face the night alone (I don't wanna live) I could never make it through my life If I had to make it on my own I don't wanna love nobody else (Don't wanna love nobody else) I don't wanna find somebody new I don't wanna live without your love I just wanna live my life with you (Live my life with you)

      Rela Ku Pujuk -   Ku dikejar bayang bayang resah Bila hatimu masih tak berubah  Enggan di punya dan di penjara Belaian cintaku ini  Aku bukanlah lelaki yang tewas Bisa menyembam walau ku di tolak Biar di uji kanan dan kiri Kau kan tetap ku miliku   Tiada lepas yang lebih agung Kalimah cintamu yang ku tunggu tunggu Biar jasadku yang menanggung Permainan darimu rela ku pujuk  Janganlah kau salahkan aku Terus memburu menawan cintamu Daku percaya sedikit masa  Kau kecundang akhirnya  Usahlah kau bersedih di hadapanmu aku hadir Memadam resah dan curiga dari hatimu oh Apakah kali ini bisa kau tolak dan berlari Setelah aku menanamkan azimatku
