      Ok real quick news then I’ll get to the story. I went to graduation today, Ryan was looking uber hot in his white button up tee shirt with the collar up. But other than that grad. was really boring. My lips really started to hurt after playing the songs over and over again. Then I went to a graduation party for my distant cousin. I met my other distant cousin Tony. He went to the same college I want to go to, Berklee in Boston. It’s a music college, sounds like lots of fun. Then I went to the carnival with my three cousins. I had more fun then I thought I would. I am really tired right now, and I even drank a Redbull. It’s not working though! Ok back to the story.  At first, Goku and Hakkai are facing away from each other in bed. But goku’s stomach mumbles and he flips over. He stairs at Hakkai’s back for a little while thinking of the last time he had pleasure. It was with a boy, about the age of fourteen. Goku thought of it so much he got hard and accidentally poked Hakkai in the back. Hakkai feels the poke and immediately turns over. “ Goku did you just poke me or am I feeling things?” Goku blushes a little “I think your just feeling things” He turns his head still blushing. Hakkai looks at Goku, and Goku looks back at him. Hakkia now starts to blush as he puts his arms around Goku. Hakkai looks down at Goku’s moist lips. Goku closes his eyes and they lock together. Goku moans a little as Hakkai starts to move his hands across Goku’s body. Hakkai then starts to kiss Goku on his neck and goes down the to the middle of his. He then moves his way back up to Goku’s lips. Goku feels the pleasure surging threw his body and he moans again. Hakkai starts to go down to Goku’s neck, but Goku stops him and pulls him back to his lips. Goku starts moving his hands around Hakkai’s body and Hakkai gets goosebumps and shivers a little. Goku then starts to kiss Hakkai on his stomach. Hakkai moans a little “Oh Goku”.  - To be continued in part 3  Leave a comment someone please, I haven’t had a comment in decades. TTYL

      It had been almost a month that Sanzo and Gojyo disappeared. Goku and Hakkai had been looking for them the entire time but had no luck. They had become very tired and decided to stay at an inn for the night. The only room that was available had only one bed. They took it reluctantly, but they were so tired it really didn’t matter.  When they got to the room Goku went immediately to the fridge. It was empty and Goku started to complain. “Food, must have food, give me food”. Hakkai really started to get annoyed so he threw a book at Goku. “If you’re a good little monkey I will get you some food in the morning. Goku rubbing his head says “I am hungry now and whats ‘good little monkey’ supposed to mean?” Hakkai look at Goku with a glare in his eye “you will find out tonight”. Goku gets worried “I will sleep on the floor tonight, your creeping me out a little.” Hakkai starts to freak out a little but he does not show it. He has a secret crush on Goku and thinks this would be the perfect chance to hit on him. “There’s not enough blankets, you’re going to have to sleep on the bed with me. I promise I won’t do anything funky.” Goku reluctantly replies “Ok whatever just get me food in the morning and I’ll do whatever you want me too.” Hakkai’s heart jumps a little he’ll do whatever I want him too, this could get interesting. They both strip down to their boxers and hop into bed. - To be continued  Ok it’s a start; it’s my first fanfic so don’t blame me if it’s bad. I am going to bed cause I got to play at graduation tomorrow. TTYL

      I am so happy! I bought a Gravitation manga today. Luckily my dad didn’t pay enough attention to what I was buying. They only had volume 6, so I got that. Oh yeah, We got first place at the parade last week. We beat our archenemy, Wellsville. Still undefeated muahahahaha. Raining out today, that really blows. I can’t go to the carnival tonight. I am going to go tomorrow instead. The concert last night was great. I had a lot of fun. The trumpet where hitting the high notes. They sounded pretty sweet if I do say so my self. Got to go read my manga. Maybe I will post a yaoi pic later.TTYl

      Today was m’kay, I had marching band this afternoon. I didn’t talk to Ryan much, I’m not sure why. I guess I am just getting a little pissed that I can’t be with him. I wish I had a boyfriend, I have never had one before. I’ve only had girlfriends and that’s to keep my reputation. I had no feelings for the girl, which is pretty rude. I guess it would be called using them, but I have stopped going out with girls. Now that we are older all they want to do is kiss. Just the thought of kissing a girl makes me gag.  After marching band I had to go to a meeting for fall sports. I signed up for soccer for the second year. I played on JV last year and I will be doing the same this year. I guess its true what they say about soccer boys. hehe. My stupid step-mom was supposed to go, but she didn’t and I was forced to get a ride home from the coach.  Tomorrow is a very good day. I get to go to a concert. It’s the Southern Tier Swing Band, they are awesome. My band teacher plays bass in the band. I can’t wait, but it doesn’t start until 7:00pm. I can’t wait to hear the swinging trumpet players.  OMG, I am drinking tea, I hate tea. I only like it when there is no sugar, and I still don't really like it. Maybe I will get my hair cut tomorrow, whatever happens, happens. Well thats all for now. TTYL

      Sorry I haven’t posted in a while. I was a little busy; in other words I was being lazy enjoying my summer. :D I didn’t screw up my solo at the parade, and I think we may have got 1st place but I won’t find out until tomorrow. I got to sit with Ryan on the bus to the parade, I really wanted to confess my love to him, but I am to much of a goddamn wuss. I love him so much I would die if I could be with him in the afterlife. I found another pic that I like of Shinji and Kaworu; I will post it later. I started writing a fanfiction the other night but when I was done writing my browser crashed and I lost everything. I really didn’t feel like typing it again so maybe I will get to it later. This Saturday I have to go to graduation and play, then I have to go to a graduation party. It going to suck, but luckily the day before I get to go to a county fair. That will be somewhat enjoyable. But I have to go with my 3 cousins, which really blows. Other than that not much is going on. TTYL

      No more school, I took my last test today. The test wasn't that hard but it wasn't easy. It was Earth Science, one of my best subjects. It was a three hour long test; it felt like it took all day.  Well, in other news, I am trying to find a way to next years Anime Boston. I am trying to get Mike to go with me, but I don't think he wants to. If there is anyone out there in computer land that has any ideas leave a comment. Maybe I can get money off of DBGT.com, sorta like a collection for money. On the subject of DBGT.com I just found out today that it's closed until the beginning of July. That means deadlines, and maybe money :D.  Well my parade is tomorrow, which really blows. I think I will stay up really late tonight, so I will be tired tomorrow. Good idea right? Yep, I thought so. I will be in Yahoo Yaoi chats tonight so you can catch me there if you wanna chat. My yahoo sn is supergasaraki.  Well, in my personal life I ignored Kym today. I talked to Ryan for the first time in a week, and I got raped by a monkey. Tricked ya, you didn't see that one coming did ya?  My cousin is coming up from Florida next week. It will be the first time I have seen him in like two years. I don't think I like him very much, but I'm not sure. I'll let you know next week. I am running out of material for my blog, so I am going to start a story. It will be a 4 part story, one part for every day in the next two weeks. It will be a yaoi fanfiction of "Saiyuki". I will call it "Saiyuki: Goku and Hakkia's Confrontation" I will post the first part tonight, until then TTYL.

       Aaahhhh, Kym called me today. I forgot to tell you that I have told her most of the stuff I have wrote so far. Well anyway, she asked me what my reaction would be if she wrote me a letter that said "I love Ryan" all over it. I told her I would shoot her. I was being sarcastic, obviously. I think she is just trying to get back at me for being gay. I hate her guts, I should have never told her anything.    I have told two people ever, Kym and a girl named Beth. Beth was the reason I stopped dating girls. I hated kissing girls and I knew that if I went out with her I would have to kiss her. Well we got really close, and then my friend Mike showed up in the middle. I was in love with him at the time. At this time I told Beth I was gay, and she decided that sense she couldn't have me she would go out with Mike. She got really close to kissing him but stopped for my sake. She also told Mike I was gay, and Mike told a lot of people. Now I had to deny everything I told her. I also was forced to go out with her to keep her away from Mike. It didn't work out to well, three days after we started going out she cheated on me with Mike. We then broke up the following day.    After that Kym thought that she would try to go out with me. I then told her that I was gay and that I was in love with Ryan. Even though I told her she still wont get over me. Well since she told me that she likes Ryan today, I think I will ignore her. That will make her real mad.   Other than that there isn't that much going on. I helped my dad build a Horseshoe game pit...thing...whatever you call it. It started to rain and I got soaked and really muddy. I don't even like horseshoes, so why are we building it? I guess so we can spend more quality time together, it sounds like so much fun. I found out what it's called. It's a backyard horseshoe court, oh boy it sounds fancy. I have my last final tomorrow, I am very happy. It's earth science which is my best subject. It's also a three hour long test which really blows. Well that's all for now. TTYL

      Technically since I started writing this at 12:29 am it is day three. Well I am bored on the internet, but I don't want to go to bed. Lets talk about more of my personal life, shall we. Well there is this girl that is obsessed with me. She is really annoying, her name is Kym. I just wish she would give up, obviously she not my type. At one time I did go out with girls but that ended this year when it all got to complicated. Blah. I am getting really nervous, this parade Saturday will have 20,000 people and I have a trumpet solo. Its also localy televised. I might just pass out before I get to the judges stand then I don't have to play. So far our marching band is undefeated, but then again we only marched two parades. We have a really small band with like less than 40 people. We have no color guard, to bad. I hate being a virgin, it makes life very boring. At the moment there is only one person I want to lose my virginity to and that is Ryan. Ah you basterd why do you have to be some god damn stubborn. Thanx for the comments Amanda, at least I know someone has read my posts. Well that's all for now. TTYL

      Oh boy, what an tough day. First, I had a 3 hour math test, then I had marching band practice. Luckily, I have no school tomorrow. Well now I will talk about my life. I am in love, have you ever noticed how love is either the best or the worst thing in the world. I am in love with a boy named Ryan. But to the best of my knowledge he does not love me back. I think he is in love with my friend Mike, but he could turn out to not even be gay. He reminds me of Shinji from NGE. I guess that would make me Kaworu. Well, that's all I'll divulge today.

      Sorry its been so long since I posted, but I've been a little busy. I had to do a couple of reviews for DBGT.com and I've been playing alot of Runescape. During the day I've been out playing basketball, soccer, and I've been going swimming. This summer is really going by fast, and I really hate that. This Thursday Pat is going to return to NY, which really sucks. I am not going to be able to see him for about another year. Next week school starts here in NC, so that means I'll get to be alone with Benny. MUAHAHAHA. He is homeschooled, and he won't start for a little while after real school starts here. There really isn't to much going on. TTYL

      I've become obsessed with songs from the movies in the last few days. I really like "Take my breath away" from Topgun and I like the Romeo and Juliet theme from the 1966 movie. It makes me want to become a movie scorer. The Romeo and Juliet theme is one of my favorite songs. Its full of sorrow and heartbreak. It makes me want to cry everytime I hear it. Now look what I'm talking about. I'm gayer than I thought I was. I hate being gay, I wish that I could just say that I don't want to be gay and it could be a reality. Pat is finally here, he's one of my friends cousin. He's really hot, my age, and is a soccer player. WooHoo!! Wish me luck everyone!! I'm trying to keep my problems out of my blog, because it gets really boring and some people don't like it. *cough, cough*   Today I played alot of soccer and basketball. The day went by fast and I enjoyed most of it. I think I have a caffien addiction, I drank 5 cans in the past 4 hours. I really don't care about my body, so it doesn't matter what I do. I'm gonna go put a curse on some of my friends. TTYL

      I became a wiccan priest today. My wiccan name is Akki, which is really wierd because it is the Japanese word for evil and demons. That means I can perform love spells now. Wiccans believe in good and light, but there has to be some evil ones out there. MUAHAHAHA. That's all I really feel like writing for today. TTYL

      Benny is supposed to come over tomorrow, which makes me made because I'm not sure if I should kiss him or not. Whatever happens, happens. Fate is really starting to piss me off and I think I'm gonna give it the slip and control my own life from now on.  I was gonna respond to what you said Joshua, but I figured I don't need any enemies. I really didn't want you to take what I said the wrong way. Your right, we are different, I just ment that we have a few things in common: yaoi, love problems, and a blog were we express our problems. Sorry that I offended you and I promise I won't ever say another thing about you in my blog.  I got Saiyuki Vol. 3 in the mail today. I guess I should change my fanfic because it really doesn't fit that well with the story. It was a good vol. but it wasn't as good as the others in my opinion. It wasn't as funny as the rest, but I like the storyline better this time. Well, wish me luck tomorrow and just hope that I do the right thing, whatever that might be. TTYl

      Finally the storm is over and I can finish writing in my blog. Wow, somebody else has read my blog. Sorry I didn't let you know, Joshua, that I put you on my site, but I was planning on it. Yeah, I know there isn't alot of blogs on my list yet, but I don't know that many people with blogs who like yaoi, especially boys. Your the only guy whos blog I read, don't feel honored because I am not an honorable person. I'm just a nobody with problems in his life that can only complain on the internet because he doesn't trust anybody in the real world. It sounds like we have a few things in common Joshua, doesn't it?   I really miss Ryan, I told him that I had a dream about him. I asked him if he wanted to know what happened but he said no, so I didn't tell him. I have a feeling that I'm gonna be in love with Ryan for the rest of High School. I keep on fantasizing about him all the time. I imagine me going out with him and eventually asking him to marry me. Wow, thats the first time I ever thought about marriage, but it can't happen anyway because of the stupid laws here in the US. Most people that I would tell about my love for Ryan would tell me to move on, but I don't want to. I want to make Ryan mine no matter what it takes. I think when I come back from vacation I'll try to tell him again but I think my shyness will get in my way again. I think I'm gonna look on the internet for love spells and potions, I know, I'm getting desprite, but I'll do anything for the one I love. TTYl

      All day today I was depressed, for only one reason, Ryan. I had a dream last night, I'll explain the whole dream since I have nothing better to do. Somehow I found myself on top of Ryan, fully dressed, you sick perverts. We looked at eachother and Ryan said he love me. I asked him if he ment it and he said that he loved me again and he told me I could kiss him if I want, so I did. Thats how the dream ended. Just when I thought I had stoped missing him this dream came along. This sucks, now I'm lovesick and Benny is supposed to come over tomarrow, so I'll try to hold myself back, but when I get deppressed like this I might do anything. Sorry Ryo, I know he's only 12 but I like him and I need to have love in my life. Crap the lights are about to go out. TTYL

      I had a great time yesterday at the theme park. I got chris to ride in the front of a couple rollar coasters with me. I think the front is the best spot, there's nothing blocking your view. I rode "Top Gun" twice and I rode the Borg. The Borg was the best coaster I've ever been on. On it you ride hangings upside down, like your laying on your back, looking at the ground. It was so sweet, it makes you feel like your flying.  In other news, I talked to Kym today. I actually enjoyed the conversation, she wasn't that annoying. She usually bugs me the entire time. It made me fell better about telling her I was gay. I might tell her about my blog, but I'm going to have to edit the things I've said about her. I think if I was going to tell another person (that I'm not attracted to), it would be Chris because he is not a very biased person and he knows me so well I don't think he would freak out. But I don't think I will tell him anytime soon.  I'm thinking of starting up a new website, I'm not sure what I want it to be about yet. It's either going to be anime or a yaoi site. I dunno, maybe I'll make two sites.   I have to watch my neices tonight, wish me luck! I only get paid 13 dollars though which really sucks, but its better than nothing. I think I'm going to order a Saiyuki collectors box to hold my dvds. I can't wait for the third volume to arrive next week. The first two were so good and very funny. Well its about time for me to go. TTYL

      Yay, tomorrow is my blogs 1 month anniversary. Over 4,000 words written and 20 posts later(not to mention one loyal fan, *cheers for Ryo* thanks Ryo, you kept me blogging) we are finally here. Today was a good day, I got to play B-ball with Benny. He is supposed to come over tomorrow, but I found out I'm going to a theme park with one of my friends. I'm going with my friend Chris, he's pretty cool and he used to be my favorite friend until Benny moved in at Easter time. I feel really bad changing my best friends, but Chris isn't gay and Benny might be. It makes you wonder "How do you know Chris isn't gay?" Well I guess he is the first guy I tried to be with. It didn't work out to well, and for some reason Chris doesn't think I'm gay witch is supprising since I tried to screw him a few years ago. He just pushed me away and thought I was joking I guess. I've got all the Gravitation finally downloaded, now all I have to do is watch it all. Shuichi is my favorite, he is the best looking. Yuki is also pretty hot. I've got another good yaoi website. Its  urlLink YaoiHell , and its full of good yummy yaoi. Well I better get to bed so I'm not tired tomorrow. TTYL

      I didn't get to talk with Benny yesterday,but thats ok because I got to talk to some else. Ryan!! He never did get the message I sent him, that makes me very happy. We talked for quite a while yesterday and the subject of love never came up. God, I miss him so much. For todays agenda I'm gonna try to play B-ball with my friends. Hopefully they will be home today, cause they weren't yesturday. I might invite Benny over ot my house, but I'm not going to come right out with anything like I was planning on before. Now that I know Ryan doesn't know I'm not that desperate anymore.   I hate NC, its to f*cking hot. Its 90 already and its almost 1:00pm!! Well there's not much other news going on so I'm going to write on my Saiyuki fanic. Enjoy!   Saiyuki: Goku and Hakkai's Confrontation - Part 2  Hakkai and Goku wake up the next morning in eachothers arms. Goku feels a little uncomfortable and turns around, his back to Hakkai. He wonders if Hakkai really likes him, or was only horny. He thinks about the night before, and gets hard once again. But this time he gets out of bed and gets dressed. Hakkai is still asleep and Goku leans over him and kisses him gently on the lips. Hakkai's eyes open and with rage he pushes Goku away. Goku with tears in his eyes says "I knew it, you don't love me....you bastard". He then runs out of the room. Hakkai sitting up in bed tries to think what is going on, but he can't remember a thing from the night before. Hakkai says outloud "Oh F*ck, it must have happened again, it was a full moon and I didn't notice it." You see, Hakkai has this condition that on every full moon his personality changes completely and the next morning he can never remember a thing. This same think happened to him with Sanzo. Hakkai now knows what he must do, he has to fall in love with Goku or they will never be friends again. Hakkai walkes downstairs to find Goku sitting on a stool at the bar with his head burried in his hands. Hakkai puts his arm around Goku and says " I'm sorry Goku, you just frightened me. I do love you and nothing will ever change that." Goku looks at Hakkai with amazment, then he smiles and hugs Hakkai. "I love you too".   Thats the end, yeah, I know its a crappy ending. But it's my fic so deal with it. So only one person reads my blog, thats OK because thats more than 0. Thanks for making everything clear to me Ryo. Hey, it sure is hard trying to talk to you. I guess its because you have school. How about you give me your email and we can talk that way. Thats all I have to say for today. TTYL

      I got to see Benny today for the first time in two months. He hasn't changed one bit. I think it was confirmed for me that he is gay. He became very uncomfortable when the subject of girls came up and I found out that he has never had a girlfriend before. I feel bad betraying Ryan, but I really want a boyfriend and I'm sick of waiting around for Ryan. I think I'm going to invite Benny over tomorrow and try to get him to admit he's gay. He's really cute even though he's only 12. Only one thing is going to be a problem and that is I have to leave here in a month and a half and I will become very depressed, but I will get to see Ryan so that will cheer me up a bit. *feels like a player (AKA male slut), even though he is still a virgin*  yah, I bought Saiyuki Vol. 3 today. I bought it on Ebay so I can't wait to get it. Its supposed to be in new condition. I also earned $20 today by mowing the lawn, I wonder what I spend it on. I am getting very sad because only one person writes comments. I have no fans, and it's almost my blogs one month anniversary. I wanna know how many people read my blog daily, so everyone leave a comment. So now I'm going to bed, TTYL.

      I downloaded the first two episodes of gravitation today. I only had time to watch the first one. It was great, I really like the end. For those who have seen it, you know what I mean. Yuki and Shuichi kiss and its so beautiful. *cries* Oh yeah, I'm finally in NC. Its really hot here, but that's ok because I'm inside at the computer all day. I have a cable modem here, so I download as much anime as possible.   I'm really starting to miss Ryan, even though its been less than a week since I've seen him. I missed him so much I changed my profile picture to Shinji to remind me of him. I think I will write up a yaoi story involving me and him. Then I will get someone to draw it and I will have my own manga. Ryan didn't get on the net at all today. Hopefully he will be on tomorrow so I can talk to him for the first time since I confessed my love for him.   Today I went swimming, but it didn't cool me down much because the water was really warm. But I had fun never the less. I also rented some DVD's; one is scary movie 3. It was very funny, I give it a 7 out of 10. Oh god what's wrong with me, now I'm reviewing movies on my blog. I also rented a game for PS2, I got 13. I'm on the third level now, and the game is really fun. Oh crap, now I'm reviewing games, what's next food.   I think I going to go D/L some more gravitation, so I will TTYL.

      Tomorrow I leave to go to North Carolina. My mom lives there and that's where I go during the summer. Its like a 12 hour car ride and is going to be very boring, I wish I had a laptop. Then I'm going to stay there for a month and a half. I'm going to sit on the computer for most of the time, play basketball proly 5 times a week, and try to make out with the neighbor boy. He is the other person I love, even though I don't love him as much as Ryan. But, I not going out with Ryan so there is no problem having fun with this boy. His name is Benny by the was and I think he's 13. Yeah that's right he's 2 years younger than me but what's it matter, love is love. He's home-schooled, which is always a good sign because home schooled boys have a higher chance of being gay. Actually I made that up, but it's good to think so anyway.   News on the Ryan situation. Ryan seems to be ignoring me. I could just be paranoid like Ryo said, but I think he is. I got on aim and he kept his away message up the entire time and then he got back on later but got off before I could talk to him. I think I made the biggest mistake of my life yesterday. *cries*   Going away on vacation means no more marching band(also no Ryan *cries some more*). We remain undefeated sofar and plan to stay that way. That's pretty impressive when we have less than 30 people in our band and all the other bands are bigger. When I come back from vacation I get to play soccer. I can't wait; its the only sport I actually like to play. It doesn't help any rumors that spread around of me being gay though. Oh that reminds me there is another boy that live here in New York, but goes to the same place I go for vacation. He also plays soccer and he's pretty hot. I also think he is gay, but I think everyone that I like is gay so that doesn't count for much. Another thing that doesn't help soccer players reputation is the fact that at a nearby town there was a boy raped by team members of his soccer team.   I bought the Love Hina manga the other day. It's pretty good, but it's the worst manga for a yaoi boy to get because its full of women. But it has a good storyline never the less. Ryan even read it which surprised me because he's not an anime fan but I think he's turning into one. I should have let him read my gravi manga; I would have like to see his expression when the two guys kissed. hehe.   Just one last quick announcement, tomorrow DBGT.com is supposed to reopen. When it does I'll post a list of the anime reviews I done so you can read them. My boss wants me to do 2 reviews before it happens, not going to happen, seeing as I am leaving tomorrow. I will post a yaoi pic latter. I promise I will actually do it this time. That's all the news for today. TTYL

      What have I done. I confessed my love to Ryan, holy shit. I think I lost my best friend. I have to tell him what I told him was a joke. I am freaking out right now. I told him on aim. I don't know if he got the message or not. He had an away message up and I told him everything, but he signed off so I don't know if he got the message or not. I have to tell him it was a joke because friendship is more important then companionship,which is something I figured out a little too late. ::cries:: I want to shoot myself now! Now I will tell you what happened earlier this week. Ryan came over on monday, it was raining out so we couldn't sleep out in the tent. The next day we hung out and we got into a tv remote war. I had the remote and he was trying to get it from me. We got so close to each other that if I moved an inch closer I would be kissing him. But, I just couldn't do it even though I really wanted to. I got him to stay another night in hopes of having a second chance and we slept out in the tent. That did no good except that in the middle of the night I found him wraped around me but I don't think he did it on purpose. The next day nothing happened and when he left I became very depressed because I know I won't be able to see him for another month and a half because I am going on vacation. I sent that message to him today and I have been freaking out ever since. I just want to die. Other than that not much is going on so I will TTYL.

      So here was my great plan: Ryan is supposed to come over on Wednesday, then we’re going to sleep out in the tent. Keep in mind Ryan doesn’t no my feelings for him yet. I figure that it’s now or never, so I am going to kiss him. But, my plan is falling apart. He was supposed to come over after marching band, well that’s been canceled. We can work around that though so it’s not a big deal. But today I found out that I might be going on vacation earlier than I thought, SOMETIME THIS WEEK! Tomorrow I will call Ryan and try to make plans for him to come up that day or the next day. Hopefully I can get him to come over, then I can kiss him and maybe even lose my virginity. :D   I will post the Third Part of “Confrontation” very soon. Sorry I am too lazy right now, I am tired. I haven’t got enough sleep in the last to days. It’s mostly due to Marching band and the fourth of July. Oh yeah I found this awesome yaoi website. It’s  urlLink www.yaoifan.net .  There’s a lot of yaoi pics and doujinshi. It’s a great site. That’s all the posting for now. TTYL

      I think I'm in love once again. But this time its over the net. Its one of my co workers at dbgt.com. His name is Ashton and the picture I saw of him was pretty hot. But his looks are not the thing that attrack me to him. I just love talking with him, and I feel happy when I'm talking to him. There's only one problem, he lives on the other side of the country. And most likely hes not even gay. Oh yeah, he's also 2 years older than me. The wierd thing is I don't like older guys but for some reason I'm attracted to him.   I'm gonna order the Neon Genesis Evangelion platium edition this week. Its gonna be awesome, especiall since I should get one of the first printings whish comes with a special slip cover.  It looks as though I'm gonna be workin at a new site, thanks to Ashton. It's gonna be located at Anime-Eden.com. I dont know exactly when were gonna put it up, but it should be a pretty cool site. I designed all of the banners, and they actually look good.   Now that school has started here there is nothing to do. Benny has stoped comming which is a good thing. I dont have to worry about hitting on him. I think I sorta scared him when I put my hand on his thigh. :D  Well I should probably get some sleep, see as I stayed up until 11am this morning. I hope that everything will work itself out and I'll finaly be happy. TTYL

      I got really bored last night so I went into a yaoi chatroom. A little later a 19 year old guy RPed with me. Woot! It was a lot of fun. I was a young boy and he was a few years older than me. We met in a pub and in a dark corner we got acquainted. It was dark so nobody could see us. I'm trying to keep my blog about pg-13 so I'll stop there.   I get to interview one of my favorite voice actors. He is the Voice of Cyborg 009 and he is Zero from Pilot Candidate. His voice is awesome. I also got to interview Chris Patton, the voice of Yushiro Gowa from Gasaraki. You can check out my interviews at  urlLink http://www.dbgt.com .   I guess Benny is not for me. I've tried all my tricks and nothings happened. All Well. I just hope I get with somebody before I turn 16. I don't want to lose my virginity at an older age.   My sister is having another baby. This time its a boy. Shes had two girls already, she had her first one when she was like 16. Luckily, I dont have to worry about getting a women pregnant. :D. I hate children though, so it really doesn't matter to me.   I found out I'm gonna have to wait like 18 months before we move to LA(louisiana). Which would mean I would start in my senior year. I don't think I'm gonna stay at my high school until 11th grade and leave. I might as well just stay through all of high school.  I might get lucky when I go back to NY in a couple weeks and start soccer. There's a boy in soccer who I like, his name is Mike. He's a year older than me but he looks like he's 13. He acts a little gay and is sorta girlish, so thats a plus.   Case Closed rules!! TTYL

      Whoa I haven't posted in a while. I've been really busy. I have been doing a lot of work for dbgt.com. I've also been doing a lot of thinking. My mom might move to Louisiana, and if she does I might move with her. I need a new town to move to, then I can forget about all the people I've grown to love and hate. I'll also meet some new people, maybe some guys like me. I think I might be over Ryan, now that I've been away from him for a month. Who knows, I'll find out when I see him again. Well, I'll try to post again soon. TTYl
