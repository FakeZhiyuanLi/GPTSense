      WHEN I GO OUT I PLAY IN THE STREET I GET HIT BY CARS I EAT MASHED POTATOES I GET HIT BY CARS. -fif  So yes... MOVIE MARATHON tomorrow. Almost as exciting as CHICKEN MANIA! Can we have a CHICKEN MANIA party? It will mania-rific.  So... I'm so so so so SOOOO glad you had a great party. A SUPER-RIFIC party. I'm using a lot of caps this entry.  So Jessie found a man. Logically, that means we're next. I'm only saying this because last time Jessie found a man, about 3 years later I did. Wait. That is not a good outlook. I take it back. The two are in no way corrlated and in much sooner than two years I will find the perfect guy, as Jessie has found joneric. That is my resolution. Along with the metrosexual thing that I wrote about in my journal... like how I'm going to date one.  I really have nothing interesting to write. I'm talking to Jessie about how people are avoiding me like the plauge. I've been meaning to ask you.... do I smell?  I gotta go. I have to go... wash my hair.  ~Katherine

      Rah Rah Lima Bean I'm Seventeen! Yay! I had an awesome birthday...thanks to Katherine. Thank you, Kathbert! We will have a huge bash for your 18th birthday...a sort of "Last Chance to Be a Kid" Theme. Bubbles...Toys...WATER GUNS...anyway that's not until&nbsp;November. We need to go forking before then. Definitely.  Ok so I know this is my first blog so far. Exciting, I know. Not really because I'm watching Men In Black 2...funny stuff.  "Yeah man every weekend you'd be like "Flush me, J, flush me." And I'd be like, "Nah." So I'm not going to pay much attention to what I'm writing. Actually I only have like 15 minutes left to my birthday, so I'm going to enjoy it.  Right...so...I'll be back when I have more to say.

      Whoa! Whoa! First post! Too cool!  So, dearest Graceworth, I think we should bring back the phrase "takes one to know one." Which is,  of course, real mature. Kind of like us. But does maturity matter? That is the deep question I would like to answer today.  To be mature. Defined by Websters as "the state or quality of being fully grown and developed." Well, I am fully grown and developed. You are fully developed, but not too grown. Also, "a stage in the development of streams or landscapes at which maximum development has been reached or at which the process of erosion is going on with maximum vigor." Well,  are you being eroded with maximum vigor? I certainly am. That is why I feel I am Mature. Mature like a stock. Mature like a mutual fund. Mature like your mom last night.  But is it really fun to be mature? In the words of the great poet, "why not take a crazy chance? Why not do a crazy dance?" And that is what I ask you, Grace Leigh Young. That is what I ask you.  Ponder. Ponder.  Love always, your Katherine
