      Today, I'm happy, because it's happy to know you have friends, haha. Last night, I went with Patrick, Brent and Matt to buy fireworks, and then they made me eat a "Cream Burger"... I'll let you in on the secret - its a junior bacon cheeseburger from Wendy's with a Crispy Cream Donut in it... needless to say, I could feel myself getting fatter. But then, we went back to Patrick's house and had a fight with those little white popper fireworks... it was so much fun :) They are so funny, and so much fun. They got 7 waters at wendy's, and had a contest to see who could throw the water from the passanger seat windows to the front window shield while driving - it took 3 tries but Brent finally got it. Hahaha, it probably doesn't sound safe, but it was okay, and so much fun.  Anyway, I'm off to kick it with my sister, I am so glad she is at home. And soon, I get to see my good friend Jennifer! Yay!

      I knew girls camp was stressful while I was going through it, but I thought I could leave it all behind when I came home. But I'm still so stressed out.  When I am sick or stressed, I get nightmares, and I had a whole ton last night. One of them that I remember was that my parents were getting a divorce. Another was, I was pregnant, but I didn't know how I got pregnant because... I didn't do anything, but my parents wouldn't believe me because, I mean, you can't just become pregnant. So, I'm obviously still stressed about something, or I'm just having a hard time unwinding.  Also, my annoyance of people isn't going away. I was so sick and tired of girls, and really, people in general at the end of girls camp. But I thought that since I wouldn't be surrounded by hundreds of girls, I would be okay. But I keep snapping at people, mostly my dad. I just find him ridiculously annoying, everything he says and does. Like, he sat down next to me after I got home, and he's like, "So you're back." and I didn't even look at him when I said, "No dad, I'm still gone." and he came and started bumping into me and pushing me last night, and I just started yelling at him to stop touching me. And at the table we were eating as a family, and Aimee and her fiance Brent were there, and my dad was being annoying to me again, and I was like, "You know, I think dad needs a shirt that says, 'Hi, I'm freaking annoying'" and I mean, I meant it as a joke and everything, and he was laughing, but I don't want to hurt him, but I also just can't control how annoying I feel he is. I know its just that I'm tired and have been around annoying people for a week, but I want it to go away because it's not fair to my dad. Grrr.  On top of feeling annoyed with him, I have no desire to be with any of my friends. I had a great time talking to Neil on the phone last night, but that was about it. And one of my other friends invited me to go buy fireworks with them and stuff, and I said I would go because I know I can't sit in the house all day, but I just want to be a hermit for a while or something. Boo to being antisocial...  Anyway, church was good, though I was completely zoned out. I didn't hardly listen to the lessons at all, which isn't like me, and I would only make comments when I figured it was an answer no one else would come up with, and I was tired of waiting. That is also not like me, I'm usually too tired to wait for any of the answers so I just answer them all. (Not that I know all the answers to everything, its just that I'm the oldest one in my classes and this is my 6th time around hearing the lessons... so I know the answers)  Anyway, maybe now that I have vented some, I can start feeling normal again. I think I will go sleep or read or something. Yay for really long entries!

      Hey everyone! I'm  finally  back from girls camp! I'll do as short of an overview of the week as I can (though its very long, and I'm sorry for that) while still saying what I want to say, starting with some good stuff, then some bad stuff, and then I'll end with some more good stuff so it won't sound like such a downer :)  First of all, I have rocking friends! On Tuesday, I got a letter from Jennifer, a postcard from Andy (which was thoroughly hilarious) and multiple letters from Lenny (one of which we read out loud at camp fire in front of everyone. We said that it was written to Rachel Miles, haha). And then on Thursday, I got the most exciting letter of all (no offense to the rest of you awesomes who wrote me). It was from Jon! He made me the funniest little book with pictures in it of the two of us, and he wrote commentary and stuff, and then he wrote me just a regular letter - it was so awesome, especially because that was when I was beginning to have a hard time and I was frustrated. It was so awesome - Jon, you rock :) Thanks to all you who wrote to me, it made me so happy, and thanks to Neil for the valiant (yet unsuccessful) effort ;0)  So, a very brief overview of some of the negatives of camp: We were having a major modesty and respect issue at camp. Also, I was in the cabin with camp committee, who are separate from us (the presidency) but didn't really understand that, I guess, so the whole week there was this whole drama about how they thought we thought we were better than them, and then they didn't bring their own alarm clock so we had to wake them up for flag every morning, and then they got really mad at us because they didn't want to go to flag, even though they were in positions at camp where all the girls knew who they were so they needed to be examples, and they blamed it on us that they should have to go to flag at girls camp. They've done it for at least 5 years now, why is this year any different...   We had way too many pranks at camp. I don't want to go into details, but one in particular had nothing to do with me except that it was... done to me. I wasn't offended or anything, it was all out of fun and what not, but the adult leaders were very close to making me apologize to the whole camp because of what the girls had done. To me. "Hello everyone, I just wanted to say I'm sorry because I have friends that don't think things through..." I don't know, it was just dumb, I don't think the adult leaders thought things through either. I didn't end up having to say sorry, and the girls were talked to and what not. Anyway, that was just like, 1/10th of the things that went on, all of which I had to fix because they happened to/because of the girls I was rooming with... the ones that were giving us problems anyway. Oh well, enough of that.  With everything so stressful, the other members of the presidency and I had an emotional breakdown... which was scary, emotional breakdowns are a strange experience. Everything was just weighing down on us... and everything turned out alright (though the worst came  after  the emotional breakdown, haha)  A lot of great things happened through the week, though they are hard to find through all the hard times. I learned so much, and a lot of things stuck with me:  One of the teachers said, "Happiness is a choice". I love that, because I know a lot of people who talk about how sad they are and unhappy they are with life, but really... happiness is a choice. I know that probably sounds hypocritical because of all the complaining I did about camp already. So I am going to modify that phrase: "Happiness is a choice, unless you are severely sleep deprived and stuck in a leadership position at a secluded location for a week with 200 hormonal and overly dramatic girls."  I also learned some things about myself. First, I learned that I have a phobia of germs. Haha, I would brush my teeth before and after meals, and even some other times in between then. I was constantly using my hand sanitizer, I couldn't stand it when people sat on my pillow, and... I don't know, I just realized that man, germs scare me.   I also learned that when I want to, I have a lot of patience. In my cabin, there were two... not completely mentally stable girls put together with Kendra, a black girl from inner-city D.C. who isn't LDS. All week, Kendra would say something completely inappropriate, vulgar and loud, and then the other two girls would start screaming and yelling at Kendra, and none of them really knew what they were doing, I mean, they didn't know any better. It was so frustrating because all 3 of them would mouth off to us and adults, I was going crazy by Tuesday. But, I'm happy to say that all 3 of them made it out alive :) I am pretty impressed with how well I controlled my urge to yell at them and be rude and stuff.  It was a good week for helping me to reanalyze the person I want to be and get everything back into perspective. That was partially because I got to read scriptures more often than I usually do and be surrounded by a positive environment where I could actually think, and also because I was around so many amazing girls. The three girls that I bunked with (different from the three girls I talked about earlier) who were in the presidency with me are so amazing, and we all came to the agreement that boys, for the most part, are much less dramatic than girls, and that they are so much better to be around for that reason. But all three of them aren't very dramatic, so we got along great, and I grew a great appreciation for all my friends that are girls that aren't dramatic about everything. I also laughed at all the boys I know that  are  dramatic.  **As a very small side note, my friend Kiera Bennion and I decided that I am going to marry her brother, Dane Bennion. This is because we have the same birthday so we will never have to worry about forgetting each others', and if we get married on that day, we wont have to worry about forgetting that either! Also, I want to have very musically inclinded children, and seeing as he has the most beautiful voice I've ever heard come out of any teen-age boy's mouth, it should be easy. Also, his family is so wonderful. Sounds perfect, yes? haha ;-)**  Anyway, I learned a lot and I got to think about my goals and stuff, and despite the massive amounts of stress and pressure, it was a good experience. So, I am going to go sleep and hopefully wake up in time to hang out with my amigo Neil. Hopefully I'll talk to all you cool people soon! (Again, thanks for the letters guys, they really made my day... and week... and such, haha)  Bye!

      Okay, I seriously have the best, most hilarious friends in the world. I hung out with a few of them tonight, and I had so much fun. So, I picked up Kendra, and then we went to pick up Val, and then Missy, and then we went to target to get some face paint. Whooo face paint! Then we went to visit Jenna at work (she was closing :( sad times!) and we decided to paint our faces like we were captain planeteers - I was Heart (I had a giant heart that covered my face), Val was fire (she had flames from her chin and cheeks), Kendra was wind (She had wind coming out of her nose, and then PFFT on her forehead) and missy was water (She had an ocean on her cheeks and then a fish on her forehead) but val and missy decided to make HUGE eyebrows, or more like, eyebrow... anyway, first we stopped at grocery outlet in hopes that Brent and Alan were working, but they weren't because it was closed! So we went to their house and took pictures with their parents and Brent - what a great family, hahaha. Brent and Bishop posed like captain planet himself... hahaha. After that, we went to Ms Erwin's house and forked her lawn... :) and  then  we went to Kendras and I put together a bunch of pictures from the night and put them into that picture of Sirius Black from HP so it looked like we were criminals, and then I changed it from "Have you seen this wizard?" To "Have you seen this Mormon?" MMMMmmmm :) Good times.  Yeah, we are a bunch of crazies, but I love them. :)  And Neil, I love you too. Thanks for leaving happy comments, and also, that episode we watched today, oh my gosh, hahaha. I wonder if Terry will be okay! Hahaha how sad if they used her death from that as an excuse to cut her from the show, hahaha. I heart you chica!  Okay, time for bed! Night!

      I went to the gym with Megan again today and Bryan was there. We had a good time, we played basketball and stuff. Then I played tennis with Bryan, and went to say goodbye to Melody. Every so often I'd want to cry, but I didn't. Addy was there with his awesome red Jeep. He's a good kid. Lenny and Neil were there too. I'm gonna miss that girl...  I slept and then went to youth group. I was going to go see a movie with Bryan, but when I called him he was sleeping and when he called back I was sleeping. Good timing, I wasn't in much of a mood for a movie anyway, its so nice outside.   War sucks. In general. The war overseas, and thinking about everything others have to go through for our freedom. But even wars here, wars between friends, stupid wars between people who just don't take the time to get to know each other, and wars within ourselves. I think the wars within ourselves can sometimes be the worst kind... not feeling good enough, not knowing what to do, all that kind of stuff. I just wish that, for a little while, everyone could be happy, content, whatever. No... I am not wishing for world peace... I swear...  Haha, my sister was trying to tell my cousin about my Oregon's Jr Miss competition, so she was like, "Yeah Michelle is competing for... Miss Oregon... or something" so now my cousin thinks I do beauty pageants and stuff. Good times! I could never do something like that... well, I'm not talking about anything in particular... so I'm going to go find some way to spend my night. Much love -   This song is for my mpgis... Terry!  Turn down the lights Turn down the bed Turn down these voices inside my head   Lay down with me Tell me no lies Just hold me close, don't patronize  Don't patronize me  Cause I can't make you love me if you don't You can't make your heart feel something it won't Here in the dark in these final hours I will lay down my heart And I'll feel the power but you won't No, you won't Cause I can't make you love me if you don't  I'll close my eyes then I won't see the love you don't feel when you're holding me  Morning will come and I'll do what's right just give me till then to give up this fight and I will give up this fight  Cause I can't make you love me if you don't You can't make your heart feel something it won't Here in the dark in these final hours I will lay down my heart And I'll feel the power but you won't No, you won't Cause I can't make you love me if you don't

      There have been so many grad parties lately. I didn't get to stay at Jake's very long, which made me sad because I really like Jake a lot. I went to Elizabeth's, and we spent the majority of the time talking about old TV shows we used to watch when we were younger. We talked about Guts, Captain Planet, Carebears, Smurfs, Ureka's Castle, Power Rangers, and a bunch of other cool shows. It was great to just sit around and have fun with friends before they all leave.   I left Jakes party to go to the Ryan Shupe and the Rubber Band concert. I wasn't expecting much, but it turned out to be SO COOL! They each played like, 5 instruments, they even did this thing where they stood in a line and with one hand played their own instrument and with the other played the next guys instrument. There was an electric cello, which was so cool. They played the most awesome version of "The Devil Went Down to Georgia", where they changed some of the stuff, so that in the end the devil was dancing like Michael Jackson, and then this other guy started clogging, and he was actually good! It was so much fun.   Yesterday I sang at seminary graduation, which was really hard. I rarely get nervous, but I was pretty nervous for this, probably because I had never once gotten through the song with the right words, and very very last minute I had a piano player and a cello player backing me up. It turned out pretty well, it was a weird performance for me. And I was really smart, I ate ice cream the night before which was totally screwing me over when I got up there, cause I tried to drink it off with water, and then I really had to go to the bathroom. I got a lot of compliments that really surprised me, one girl tried to describe my voice as "strong but not too...opera-like", and then this bishop grabbed my arm and told me that I sang the song like I wrote it, and I'm thinking, what are you talking about, I  did  write it, haha. Kidding, of course, but though that was a really strange comment, it was really nice to hear, and it meant a lot to me. After I sang, I hung out with Val and Kendra and Jenna, who were SO awesome to come just to listen to me sing. They are so hilarious and great, wooooh! I also hung out with Melody and Melinda, which was also hilarious, and I hung out with Brent and Patrick, my friends from Glencoe... who are hilarious too. Wow, I have hilarious friends, lol. I talked with Brent the longest, he stayed with me till most everyone else was gone, which was cool cause I don't get to see him much, and he is one rocking kid.  After Seminary grad I went over to Melody's with Melinda which was a lot of fun, I was really tired though, so I fell asleep relatively early, on this bed with a really hard bar, and I kept rolling over to Melinda, hahaha. Then I woke up early to go to the gym with megan, so I'm pretty tired right about now. But, I can't sleep yet cause I have to take care of girlscamp stuff and shower and go to my meeting deal... then I can sleep :) I am glad, Megan and I have this whole workout plan figured out, I'm excited. She is also hilarious, hahaha.  Summer so far, has been stressful. Once girlscamp is over, I have to start worrying about Junior Miss, and Aimee's wedding and all that good stuff. The only difference between now and when school was in is that I actually have time to do all the work I was supposed to do before now, so I'll be pretty busy. I think I like it that way though, it's better than being bored, I suppose. But somewhere in the middle of being so busy, I have time to be philosophical, and think about things like this; People can never really know if they are beautiful. Like, people can tell them that they are good looking, and they can believe them, but we look at ourselves so much that we really don't even know what we look like. We don't know how we look to everyone else. So, anyone can complain that they aren't good looking, but if you think about it, they don't know. They can't ever know, unless they go blind and then un-blind and then see a picture of themselves or something. So the next time you want to start whining about how you don't think you're attractive, just keep that in mind... ;-)  Well, now I've got to get to... all that great stuff I've got to get to! You're beautiful ;-)  Don't close your eyes They may not open What if they open Would you be alive  Everyone falls But not everyone rises Why don't you get up And rise again for me  What if the world were a little more perfect Would you stop crying or would you take the leap What if the world  were a little more perfect Would you open your eyes and blink again for me  What about friendship What about friends You said the whole world was against you And it all had to end  What about love What about family What about all that you have to live for  It isn't easy here without you Why did you leave me What am I supposed to do Without you  What if the world were a little more perfect Would you stop crying or would you take the leap What if the world  were a little more perfect Would you open your eyes and blink again for me

      I thought this was kind of cool... and it made me happy :) Though the description doesn't fit me very well... especially about writing music. Yeah... I don't even pretend to be good at that, haha     Ballet shoes- beautiful, graceful, and creative, you enjoy dancing writing and music.  You are often very poetic and sometimes dramatic.  You keep to yourself aside from a few close friends that you can relate to.    urlLink   What Kind of Shoe Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     And we have yet another that made me happy, this one was just funny though.

      Hooray for doing AWFUL on the ACTs! I celebrated with ice cream, which halfway through I realized was a really stupid idea because I am supposed to sing tomorrow. Not only is the coldness bad, but all that milk... I'm basically screwing myself over. At least it tasted good :)  I took the ACTs with Rachel Patrick, which was fun. Val Fry and Ben Ellis, too. And it was an even bigger Mormon party in the next room over. The first two sections I actually did pretty well, but the last two... I just gave up, I think. It was so bad... though I know I would never want to become famous, it would really come in handy right about now so I wouldn't have to worry about getting into college! Whooooo!  So, my plans for the day are to hopefully hang out with Jenna Holloway because I haven't done that in a long time, and then go work out with Neil and Jake. Maybe I'll practice my song for a tomorrow, or sleep or something.   I get this weird thing when I'm cold sometimes, like right now. All of my fingers are freezing except my thumb and index finger on my right hand, which are burning hot. Maybe I'm dying - yay for not having to worry about getting into college! Whooooo!  haha, just kidding. Anyway... see ya!  Is this the real life- Is this just fantasy- Caught in a landslide- No escape from reality- Open your eyes Look up to the skies and see- I'm just a poor boyIi need no sympathy- Because I'm easy come,easy go, A little high,little low, Anyway the wind blows,doesnÂt really matter to me, To me  Mama,just killed a man, Put a gun against his head, Pulled my trigger, now he's dead, Mama, life had just begun, But now I've gone and thrown it all away- Mama ooo, Didn't mean to make you cry- If I'm not back again this time tomorrow- Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters-  Too late, my time has come, Sends shivers down my spine- Body's aching all the time, Goodbye everybody-I've got to go- Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth- Mama ooo- (any way the wind blows) I don't want to die, I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all-  I see a little silhouetto of a man, Scaramouche, scaramouche will you do the fandango- Thunderbolt and lightning-very very frightening me- Galileo,galileo, Galileo galileo Galileo figaro-magnifico- But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me- He's just a poor boy from a poor family- Spare him his life from this monstrosity- Easy come easy go-, will you let me go- Bismillah! no-,we will not let you go-let him go- Bismillah! we will not let you go-let him go Bismillah! we will not let you go-let me go Will not let you go-let me go Will not let you go let me go No,no,no,no,no,no,no- Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go- Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me-  So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye- So you think you can love me and leave me to die- Oh baby-can't do this to me baby- Just gotta get out-just gotta get right outta here-  Nothing really matters, Anyone can see, Nothing really matters-,nothing really matters to me,  Any way the wind blows....

      I'm just trying to study for my ACTs, you know, get some math down before I go in there and die of stupidity, but my ACT prep CD doesn't work, like, it will get to a certain point and freeze. I tried cleaning it, I think it's just scratched or something. Boo to that. So, I'm a little worried about not doing well tomorrow... how sad if I get a low score. The good thing about ACTs though is that if you answer a question wrong it doesn't count against you. So, I can answer all the questions and have a better chance of getting a better score, I hope.   Andy Musser is one hilarious kid. (I cut out my random outbursts of laughter)  papamambo15: You know what my horoscope said today? papamambo15: It said "Tonight is a night for romance"! papamambo15: It said a lot of other crap too, but that's the only part I read papamambo15: ha ha ha papamambo15: I'm waiting for it to take effect papamambo15: Oh wait...someones knocking at the door papamambo15: just sec... papamambo15: Ahhhhhh! save me!  papamambo15: This bag lady wants to marry me! papamambo15: Oh wait...she's a he.... papamambo15: This is not the kind of romance I want! papamambo15: ha ha ha papamambo15: Ok, that didn't happen. But if it did I would have to sue the newspaper papamambo15: I wouldn't marry the bag lady...maybe just date her a while...j/k, ha ha ha papamambo15: Let her down slowly Auto response from Mcmoosie: Give me an A! Give me a C! Give me a T! What does that spell! DEATH!!  Attempting to study for ACT's, I'm here though, so... talk to me :-)  papamambo15: ha ha ha papamambo15: Ohhh! ACT! i'm studying for the SAT papamambo15: not now, but I'm getting ready for it papamambo15: before they change it, I'll take it this fall papamambo15: Hopefully they won't mind if I take it nude. I think best when not bound by clothes  ----  Idunno, maybe you've got to know him to think he's hilarious. But, he made my day. I was going to go work out tonight, either with Jennifer or Neil, but Jennifer was busy and Neil said he would call me and he never did. So I'm regretting not working out, especially the night before ACTs. Maybe I'll go to the gym... it's late though. Who knows.  No one is around, so I think I'll go to the gym.   This has been bothering me for EVER! This song, I Don't Wanna Know, its pretty popular right now, and P-Diddy raps in it. And every time I listen to it, I SWEAR I hear him say, "Gave you extra cheese" and I was like, what the heck? That makes no sense, that can't be what he's saying. So I finally remembered to look it up... here's just part of the rap  I'm not applyin' no pressure  Just want to let you know That I don't wan to let you go And I don't want to let you leave Cant say I didn't let you breath  Gave you extra cheese  Put you in the SUV You wanted ice So I made you freeze Made you hot Like the western beats Last time you invest in me Cuz if not then its best you leave holla  Okay Diddy, we caught you. Why are you giving her extra cheese...  -----  The strands in your eyes that color them wonderful Stop me and steal my breath Emeralds from mountains thrust towards the sky Never revealing their depth Tell me that we belong together Dress it up with the trappings of love I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above I'll Be your cryin' shoulder I'll Be love suicide I'll Be better when I'm older I'll Be the greatest fan of your life Rain falls angry on the tin roof As we lie awake in my bed You're My Survival, You're My Living Proof My love is alive and not dead Tell me that we belong together Dress it up with the trappings of love I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above I'll Be your cryin' shoulder I'll Be love suicide I'll Be better when I'm older I'll Be the greatest fan of your life I've dropped out, burned up, fought my way back from the dead Tuned in, turned on, remembered the things you said I'll Be your cryin' shoulder I'll Be love suicide I'll Be better when I'm older I'll Be the greatest fan of your life  okay bye :)

      My friend from elementary school that I only get to see like, once a year, is in town and says no one will go see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban with her. And I mean, come on, I'm not really going to turn down an offer like that :)  Yesterday I went to graduation. It was harder than expected, I felt like a parent or something, because I cried when my friends came out. I was most moved by two things; first, kids that I knew that had struggled to get there. Like this girl on my dance team, her mother told me that without dance team, she would have dropped out of school. And there she was graduating, I can only imagine what her parents must have been feeling. Other kids too, who had to struggle last minute to meet the requirements. The second thing was the kids that I love. And I don't just mean kids that I like a whole lot, there are kids that I adore and look up to so much. I don't know, maybe that's lame, but... whatever.  I was thinking, the whole act of graduation, you know, sitting there through each kids name, everyone wearing random blue robes and really random blue hats with tassels hanging from them... what a strange... almost stupid tradition. I mean, if it had never been done before, I very highly doubt that anyone would think to put people through that. Not to say that its a bad tradition, its just so weird. I feel the same way about birthdays and holidays and stuff. Why is one day more special than all the rest? The day feels the same, except you may get presents or whatever, but really, there's nothing different about it. The two may not connect for you, but it makes sense to me, and apparently that's all that matters. :)  Well, Kirsten Storms really has made the rounds... She's in  another  Zenon. It's a winner, I can tell! So, in honor of Kirsten Storms, I have two songs for tonight.  zoom, zoom, zoom  zoom, zoom, zoom  stargazing mega fast  you hit me like a cosmic blast  you've given me a technicolor world  putting me in overdrive  speed of light, I'm so alive  could you be my supernova girl?   interplanetary, mega stellar, hydrostatic  there's no gravity between us  our love is automatic   (zoom, zoom, zoom) make my heart go  (boom boom) my supernova girl  (zoom, zoom, zoom) make my heart go  (boom boom) my supernova girl  (zoom, zoom, zoom) make my heart go  (boom boom) my supernova girl  (zoom, zoom, zoom) make my heart go  (boom boom) my supernova girl   visions of your pretty face  send me into hyperspace  caught up in a planetary whirl  breathing in you give me air  I'm living off your solar flare  could you be my supernova girl?   interplanetary, mega stellar, hydrostatic  there's no gravity between us  our love is automatic   (zoom, zoom, zoom) make my heart go  (boom boom) my supernova girl   -----  Hiding out all alone  Wrapped up in my fear  Only you see right through  Make it seem so clear   A fiery nova rolling over  Blasting into space  A blazing comet spires upon it  Your stellanarious face   Wake me up  Shake me up  Race me to the stars  So much to know  So far to go  The galaxy is ours  The galaxy is ours my girl  The galaxy is ours   A blazing chance, a cosmic blast  Soaring light or long  Sitting rough, or dare to trust  You bought the life I sold   Mystical lights, magical lights  A chance to blaze new trails  Open your eyes, travel the skies  Your sprit made you prevail   Wake me up  Shake me up  Race me to the stars  So much to know  So far to go  The galaxy is ours  The galaxy is ours my girl  The galaxy is ours   ----

      This is my blog for Kara Girod. I am talking to her right now, and she is seriously so amazing, she understands so much. She is so... just... wise. I've decided to give her the nick name, Granny-K because she reminds me of my grandma, in that she knows everything and seems to have gone through most everything. It's funny because it reminds me of special-k. She is such an amazing girl, and I LOVE how she eats so much, like some people probably think its odd, but I feel like it makes her so much cooler, she is tiny and beautiful, and its not because she starves herself. She is just amazing! She is so level headed about everything, and I really feel like I can go to her and talk to her about everything, and she doesn't have to be serious about everything.   That's a lot like me, I deal with problems with humor and stuff, and I can always count on Kara to be upbeat and light about things, even when they're really though. I love her so much :) This is my song for Kara Girod - (She told me one time that its her favorite song, and she says for her grad gift I can sing it to her)  Never know how much I love you Never know how much I care When you put your arms around me I get a fever that's so hard to bear  You give me fever, when you kiss me Fever when you hold me tight Fever in the morning Fever all through the night  Sun lights up the daytime Moon lights up the night My eyes light up when you call my name 'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right  Everybody's got the fever That is something you should know Fever isn't such a new scene Fever started long ago  Romeo loved Juliet Juliet, she felt the same When he put his arms around her He said, "Julie baby, you're my flame"  Captain smith and Pocahontas Had a very mad affair When her daddy tried to kill him She said, daddy oh don't you dare "He gives me fever "With his kisses "Fever when he holds me tight "Fever, I'm his missus "So, daddy, won't you treat him right"  Fever, when you kiss them Fever, if you live and learn Fever, 'til you sizzle What a lovely way to burn   :)

      I felt so helpless, watching my friends sit there and say things like, "This is the last class I will ever have with you... ever." Or, "That is the last bell of high school I will ever have to hear..." It's like they were  trying  to make me upset or something. It didn't seem real, though, and even though they are getting up and moving away from everything they know, I wish I could do that too. Why do I have to stay here? It doesn't seem right.  I was talking to my good friend Kara Girod today, and we were discussing a point she made a few weeks ago that I think stands very true. She said that, if you aren't okay with yourself, you aren't going to be able to add anyone in to your life. Like, if you aren't happy alone, you'll never be happy in a relationship, no one else can make you honestly content but yourself. She is so wise, that Kara. I adore her, really, she amazes me in all that she does. She's so smart and talented and still so good looking!  Neil and I decided just now, that the seniors leaving isn't really real. It's just not happening. Why are people getting sad today? I mean, hello, its just a lil joke guy.  I was so tired today, I slept a lot, it was hard. Leisha came over, and we experienced how great of a singer I am when I first wake up. Neil, Kara and Andrea then came over, they are all so great, those were good times. Then I went back to sleep. I will go to sleep early too, I have a big day tomorrow, with an MPGIS party and all. Well... I will probably write more later, but for now, goodnight.  Saying I love you Is not the words I want to hear from you It’s not that I want you Not to say, but if you only knew How easy it would be to show me how you feel More than words is all you have to do to make it real Then you wouldn’t have to say that you love me Cos I’d already know  What would you do if my heart was torn in two More than words to show you feel That your love for me is real What would you say if I took those words away Then you couldn’t make things new Just by saying I love you  More than words  Now I’ve tried to talk to you and make you understand All you have to do is close your eyes And just reach out your hands and touch me Hold me close don’t ever let me go More than words is all I ever needed you to show Then you wouldn’t have to say that you love me Cos I’d already know  What would you do if my heart was torn in two More than words to show you feel That your love for me is real What would you say if I took those words away Then you couldn’t make things new Just by saying I love you  More than words

      Today was a relatively good day. I showed up to zero period, we had a sub and all we were doing was watching movies. I was about to go home, but it was a movie of me singing, and I was curious. I wish I wouldn't have been though, lol it wasn't the most uplifting experience. We watched X-men in ToK, and P-day Ends at Six in seminary... and Oceans 11 in Health. Oh yes, and Our Town in Drama. So many movies! Only Our Town had any importance, its too bad I was so tired, I slept through it, or at least I tried to, it was rather uncomfortable.   I am in the need of some serious excersize, that's probably why I have been so tired. It didn't get to me until last night... anyway, I should get to doing that. Leisha is coming over to work on music in a little while, and I might go over to Melody's to help her pack. I'm hungry too! But hey, when am I not :)  **Total Eclipse of the Heart... the edited version (Yes, its like, twice as long!)   Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and then I fall apart  And I need you now tonight And I need you more than ever And if you'll only hold me tight We'll be holding on forever And we'll only be making it right Cause we'll never be wrong together We can take it to the end of the line Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks I really need you tonight Forever's gonna start tonight Forever's gonna start tonight  Once upon a time I was falling in love But now I'm only falling apart There's nothing I can do A total eclipse of the heart Once upon a time there was light in my life But now there's only love in the dark Nothing I can say A total eclipse of the heart  INSTRUMENTAL  Turnaround bright eyes Turnaround bright eyes Turnaround, Every now and then I know you'll never be the boy you always wanted to be Turnaround, But every now and then I know you'll always be the only boy who wanted me the way that I am Turnaround, Every now and then I know there's no one in the universe as magical and wondrous as you Turnaround, Every now and then I know there's nothing any better and there's nothing I just wouldn't do Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and then I fall apart Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and then I fall apart  And I need you now tonight And I need you more than ever And if you'll only hold me tight Well be holding on forever And we'll only be making it right Cause we'll never be wrong together We can take it to the end of the line Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks I really need you tonight Forever's gonna start tonight Forever's gonna start tonight  Once upon a time I was falling in love But now I'm only falling apart Nothing I can do  A total eclipse of the heart Once upon a time there was light in my life But now there's only love in the dark Nothing I can say A total eclipse of the heart

      I love ace of base... but really... who doesn't? I was pretty upset a little while ago, but I figure, why be upset. I have so much to be happy about. So I'll just sing a little Ace of Base and everything will be okay. I adore Jennifer's family, her grandma is here. She's so great! They are making bacon and it smells really good. I enjoy bacon. One time, when I was at a church sleepover beach thing, Amber Gravel and I wrote a song about bacon. Toxic bacon, to be exact. We wrote it because one of the leaders that was there tried to give us this extra bacon, and it was so gross, hahaha so I pulled out my guitar and started singing about toxic bacon, it was hilarious. She didn't really like the song though, haha. Go figure.  Bacon + music =  all you need in life. Really, what else do you need? (...besides easy mac...duh)  She leads a lonely life She leads a lonely life When she woke up late in the morning light And the day had just begun She opened up her eyes and thought Oh what a morning It's not a day for work It's a day for catching tan Just laying on the beach and having fun She's goning to get you All that she wants is another baby She's gone tomorrow boy All that she wants is another baby All that she wants is another baby She's gone tomorrow boy All that she wants is another baby  All that she wants - all that she wants So if you are in sight and the day is right She's the hunter you're the fox The gentle voice that talks to you won't talk forever It is a night for passion But the morning means goodbye Beware of what is flashing in her eyes She's going to get you All that she wants...

      So, I'm a little frustrated right now. I got in a fight with someone who was really close to me last night, and it feels completely unfair, I was trying so hard to be reasonable and what not, and they just kept saying all these condescending things to me and being angry and stuff, and they wouldn't calm down. Apparently, they are still upset at me, because I passed them in the halls today and they looked at me and looked away. I'm thinking, why make it more awkward than it already is? Could we be more mature about this  please?  Anyway... I'm afraid it's the end of that friendship and that really hurts. I feel so helpless... and I've already apologized, there's really nothing more I can do but wait. I just... don't want to.  It was great, though, I called my mpgis after the whole fight and it was like a breath of fresh air. He knew exactly what to say and exactly what not to say, and he knew when to make me laugh and when I just wanted to be upset. It's funny how some people are so awesome and are always there for you, and others make me feel completely insignificant. I am going to go over to jennifer's now, she makes me feel happy inside :)I am going to meet her grandma! Gotta love that girl. Bye!  Of all the things I've believed in I just want to get it over with Tears form behind my eyes But I do not cry Counting the days that pass me by   I've been searching deep down in my soul Words that I'm hearing are starting to get old It feels like I'm starting all over again The last three years were just pretend And I said,   Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to   I still get lost in your eyes And it seems that I can't live a day without you Closing my eyes and you chase my thoughts away To a place where I am blinded by the light But it's not right   Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to   And it hurts to want everything and nothing at the same time I want what's yours and I want what's mine I want you But I'm not giving in this time   Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to The one thing that I tried to hold on to   And when the stars fall I will lie awake You're my shooting star

      (( There was a lot of depressing things in like, 10 paragraphs here. They were here for a while, but then, who really needs all that sad stuff. So, It's gone. Happies!!))   Enough of that depressing junk, I have plenty more time for that later. I talked to Aimee this morning (my sister) hahaha she is such a kick in the pants, seriously. She's getting married, and her best friend is throwing her a shower, with a little twist - 'lingerie only' - hahaha, I told my dad and he was like...ewww... hahaha it was so classic. I want brownies. Brownies aren't good for you. But Neil made a good point that... we all end up the same when we're older. Besides, a few brownies aren't going to kill me. Unless there's something deadly in them, and, well in that case... haha. I should make them because they make me happy. Also, I am going to call Jenna and Jennifer. I wanted you all to know. Haha, well off I go to make brownies (if my madre will let me...) So, I'll leave you with this song. It's "I'm Moving On" By Rascal Flatts... Bye!  I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons Finally content with a past I regret I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness For once I'm at peace with myself I've been burdened with blame, trapped in the past for too long I'm movin' on  I've lived in this place and I know all the faces Each one is different but they're always the same They mean me no harm but it's time that I face it They'll never allow me to change But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong I'm movin' on  I'm movin' on At last I can see life has been patiently waiting for me And I know there's no guarantees, but I'm not alone There comes a time in everyone's life When all you can see are the years passing by And I have made up my mind that those days are gone  I sold what I could and packed what I couldn't Stopped to fill up on my way out of town I've loved like I should but lived that I shouldn't I had to lose everything to find out Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road I'm movin' on

It's a free country. Napoleon Dynamite: Get off my property! Uncle Rico: Why don't you go call the cops? Napoleon Dynamite: Maybe I will, GOSH! -- Napoleon Dynamite: Stay home and eat all the freakin' chips, Kip. Kip: Napoleon, don't be jealous that I've been chatting online with babes all day. Besides, we both know that I'm training to be a cage fighter. -- Don: Hey, Napoleon. What did you do last summer again? Napoleon Dynamite: I told you! I spent it with my uncle in Alaska hunting wolverines! Don: Did you shoot any? Napoleon Dynamite: Yeah, like, fifty of them! They were surrounding my cousin!

      This morning, I woke up and started watering all the plants, like I usually do, and Kara calls and asks me some stuff about junior miss&nbsp;- and as she was hanging up, she says, see you at noon! And I thought the meeting was at 2! Oh, silly Michelle. So, I went to the meeting, did my talent and it was definitely not something to be proud of, but then I went in for my interview, and POW! I nailed it. They asked me this question: What are three things that you know, without a doubt? I had no idea what to say, but after I thought for a little while, I said, well... I know there is a God, I know.. that I like to eat... and I know that I hate being interviewed. The judges laughed at that, and asked why I didn't like interviews, and I said, because I like to say things that aren't necessarily in the dictionary, like "radtastic", or really informal things like "super cool", and I cannot say them during an interview because then I get marked down. They laughed a lot at that, which was good. I also rocked a question about Martha Stewart. It was pretty okay. It ended on a bad note though, for me anyway, when I was leaving I had to explain the judges why my parents wouldn't be at orientation, it was kind of upsetting. But I think it was a lot because I was tired. Meh.   After that, I was in a bad mood, but then Patrick called and he went with me to Fred Meyers, and that&nbsp;helped me be in a better mood.&nbsp;Then Brent was on his break and had nowhere to go so we picked him up and went to his house. I met his sister who was listening to Avril Lavigne really loud. I am not a fan of Avril, but I am a fan of his sister, she's pretty cool, and his brother too, he's a funny guy. Then I came home and I was like, Hey mom! And she wasn't too happy with me, I'm not sure why but I decided that sticking around wouldn't be a good idea so I took a nap in my room, and came down to eat a grilled cheese sandwich that I made aaaaaall by myself.   Later, Neil called and wanted to go to Cold Stone, so he came over and I was watering plants, and he suggested that Brent and Patrick come with us, and Jenna and Jay too. So Neil and I had a great talk on the way there, we talked about leadership camp and what not, and then everyone got there and we were all talking and it was cool. And then we all went home. It was really good times.   well, time for bed. BYE!

      I wasn't going to write, but then I read Melody's blog and figured I should, even if only for Melody.   ---  Okay, so I wrote a whole bunch of stuff, and realized that Melody has heard most everything I was writing about. And I had nothing else interesting to say, and I didn't care either way about whether or not everyone else knew about what's goin on, it wasn't really important. So, Melody, I did write with the intent of filling you in, but you are basically filled in already. So, yeah, pretty much. I'll let you know if anything else remotely interesting happens.   PS - Jonathan, I called your cell and left a message.&nbsp; I will call again, and that is a threat.   okay bye

      I just back from dance and&nbsp;I'm all icky! :)  &nbsp;  It was so much fun, I got there thinking, it will be okay once warm-ups are done, because I usually hate warm-ups, but today, even warm-ups were okay, and I got my turns alright, and I got my split leaps to the front! It was thoroughly exciting.  &nbsp;  Yesterday, when I went to my voice lesson, I couldn't find it and I freaked out because it's an area that I am familiar with, why the heck couldn't I find it?! So I went to my friend Mackenzie's house to borrow her phone, but no one was home, and no one was home at Addison's house either, so... I was still freaked out, and I used my super-smart decision making skills and used Addison's neighbors phone - whom I have never met. Wheee! It turns out I was literally like,&nbsp; a street away. Luckily for me, she had no students after me and she gave me my full time plus some. It was so nice. The lesson went a lot better than expected - especially the sight-reading! She gave me a piece of music and my starting note and I had to sing the whole song, which I had never heard or seen before, by myself with nothing backing me up. I was nervous about this because Mrs. Davis (my choir teacher) told me more than once that sight-reading was a weakness for me, and that it was something I would really need to get more help on.&nbsp; (Mind you, I am almost sure Mrs. Davis does not like me). Of course, I do not like her much either, so I never worked on it, haha. Anyway, so I do it, and I messed up a little in the beginning but I fixed it, and I even stayed in the same key and I did the whole thing right! My voice teacher described my sight-reading as "outstanding" and "incredible" because, even though I messed up, I recognized it, fixed it, and stayed in the right key the whole time -  Take that, Mrs. Davis!    I am hungry, but I am always hungry. I am also sweaty. Haha, that sucks. I got some new jeans, I actually had a dream about them last night. I have had nightmares for about a month and a half straight, but this dream wasn't so bad - I mean, come on, it was about my jeans. But like, my jeans turned into this car, and I left it at the school and one of the girls from dance team drove me home, haha and I was like,&nbsp;I have to get&nbsp;my car! And then I remembered that they were jeans, and it was okay. I have very... very odd dreams. In movies, people wake up all sweaty and panting after nightmares, but I never do. I just wake up with a really dark feeling, and I'm like, oh its a good thing that was just a dream because that sucked.&nbsp;I could probably make some pretty&nbsp;stupid horror films with the dreams I have though, that could be funny. That's probably where the movie Spider Babies comes from - Jenn you know what I'm talkin about. But seriously though, that movie rocks.  Anyway, my hunger is taking over. Oh! I just remembered that I have to go to Sabrina's to return this skirt she let me barrow. I should probably shower. And eat! Ahh, so much to do! hahaha, wheeee ;)

      Mrrrrrrrrrrrrr  &nbsp;  That's my cow noise.  &nbsp;  I do not think that cows say 'moo'. I think they say 'mrrrrrrrr'. Listen next time, I think you'll agree.  &nbsp;  I just planted some bush things in my back yard. I am now dirty. I should probably shower.  &nbsp;  Some people never cease to amaze me.  &nbsp;  On TV, people often get annoyed when their friends are on the phone with someone they have a thing for and they're saying things like, "No you hang up first!" or "No, I love you more" or other such things. I never understood why that was annoying. Until recently, while listening to Aimee talk to her Fiance. I understand that they have the right to do that, but for some reason, it makes me want to throw up, or tell her to stop talking because it's annoying. I don't do either, however, because I happen to like Aimee, and she won't be around much longer, and it's not really that big of a deal.  &nbsp;  While watering the plants, I have come to really really like my mom's rhododendron and hydrangea. They are so&nbsp;cool! We are trying to keep them healthy so we can use them for Aimee's wedding, and I am glad because they are beautiful.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Rachel Patrick is cool.&nbsp;[Thursday:&nbsp;you, me and a cup of kool-aid?] I'll call you.&nbsp;

      I was just watching this movie on ABC Family about this girl who goes to a Music and Dance college, but doesn't know its a classical music school, and at the end, she is close to being kicked out because she isn't very good at classical music, but then she gets really good because she does her best to be just like the girl who is best in the class. But then she realizes that she's not being herself, so at a concert they are performing at, she finishes her classical French song by singing words she and her new hot boyfriend wrote&nbsp;to the same music in English, while dancing&nbsp;- backup dancers included. Now, if she was close to being kicked out before, I can only imagine that that would get her kicked out, despite the roaring applause coming from every one of the professors. But seriously, no one could do that! Though she was very talented... what the heck? We don't even get to see her getting kicked out, because the movie ends as she takes her last bow. Thank you, Britney and Lynn Spears, for producing such a senseless and melodramatic yet thoroughly entertaining movie.  &nbsp;  I'm starting to take voice lessons again, or at least I'm meeting with a teacher to get started and what not. I'm nervous because she already knew about me before I called her, and I don't want her to have... crazy expectations that I can't live up to. She asked me why it had taken me so long to get back into voice lessons, and I didn't tell her that it was because I was bored with the lessons - she's friends with my old teacher.&nbsp; But I did tell her that it was mostly because I just ran out of time, which is true. I told her that I quit right before "Cinderella" my freshman year, but now that I think about it, that's when I quit dance. Oh the things I do for the Hilhi drama department. I told her that I really don't have much time now, but it's important to me, and I know I need it. So anyway, I'm excited, I'm looking forward to improving.  &nbsp;  Last night was great, with the ice cream and the pot. If you wanna read about it, Jenn's got it all written out in  urlLink her&nbsp;blog . It was so much fun, with Jennifer, Newsweek and Time magazine, Chris, ice cream, and crazy men who "want to get to know Jennifer better".  &nbsp;  There is a wedding reception I would like to go to tonight, Annie Price's, actually. She was Aimee's really good friend all through grade school and middle school and stuff, she used to be in our ward for church, but she moved to Canby. I would like to see her younger sister, Katie, who is just a bit younger than me. She always has good looking boys with her, and I'm thinking, wow, she finds good looking guys in  Canby.  Good girl. She's always been really nice, I see her occasionally.  &nbsp;  When I was looking through Time magazine with Jennifer last night, I came across two really great articles. First was an interview with Hilary Duff (The Duff, if you will - I saw Amber Gravel at the blood drive a few days ago, and she informed me that that's what people call her these days...haha). Anyway, here's how it went:  &nbsp;  Time: Do you and your sister Haley wish you were twins so you could make Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen money?  Hilary: Umm... no.  &nbsp;  Haha, ohh dear. The second article was about Mormon actors, one of my favorite being Jon Heder from Napoleon Dynamite. That movie is hilarious! Anyway, the quote they got from him was, "Dude, it's cool to be Mormon." I thought that was awesome :). The article was also about&nbsp;Ryan Gosling, the guy from The Notebook, and Ken Jennings, the guy who's won a record amount of money on Jeopardy. Jennifer let me keep the article :)  &nbsp;  I'm hungry but there is nothing around my house. I suppose I could get dressed and go buy something, but I'm kind of lazy, and, that would entitle me getting dressed. I told my mom I would water the plants and clean up the mess that was made after cleaning the roof. I should get to that.  &nbsp;  I called Melody on her birthday, she seems to be having a great time, and it was so refreshing to hear her voice. I told her that I really appreciate how non-dramatic she is, like, I can always count on her to be there for me and I don't have to worry about every little thing ticking her off. I miss her a lot and I can't wait to see her, and I feel bad because if I had more time I would call her more often. Hopefully I will get to call her tomorrow.  &nbsp;  These are really random thoughts. And a lot of them. Sucks to be anyone who reads this, lol.  &nbsp;  I know I should be keeping a journal, and I used to, I would write in it every night. I know that keeping a journal is good and what not, but I stopped a while back, and it would take me years to catch up on everything - Aimee getting married, the end of school, college friends leaving, girls camp, dance team, every day stuff. I'm thinking one of these days I'll just type them all out because it's a lot faster and less painful for me to type, and I'll glue them all in my journal or something. Good plan.  &nbsp;  I also need to clean out all these boxes in my room. During school, my mom decided she wanted to recarpet the house, so I had to put all my stuff in boxes. I started cleaning them out, when my mom told me that she wanted to put wood paneling around the room too. So that was a good 3 weeks, and I just haven't gotten around to cleaning out the boxes. None of them have anything left in them that I really use, mostly books and music, my ukalele is in one of them. I have some old school stuff and a box of framed play posters I have yet to put up.&nbsp; I think I'll do that next week. Also a good plan.  &nbsp;  Aimee and I have been discussing songs I could sing for her wedding. I would love to do that, but all the songs we have been coming up&nbsp;with are just inside jokes, and my relatives would think I'm crazy. Songs like, "Waterfalls" by TLC and "What a Man" by... some other group. We've gone through a lot of Shakira songs, George Michael&nbsp;and Avril Lavigne. Of course, my mother would kill me if I even tried, haha.  &nbsp;  Addison called last night, but I wasn't home, he left a message saying he had a question, and that I should call Sean's cell. I think they are in Texas by now. Also, I don't have Sean's cell number. I think he gave it to me, but I lost it. I wrote it on my hand, but its gone now. You know, because sometimes I shower. Jenna, Missy, Valerie, Bryan, Jay and Ben (and Amyra!) all come back today. That's exciting, hopefully I will get to talk to them. Also, Kendra isn't working tonight for a change, so I'll get to talk to her hopefully when I go return her clothes. When I borrowed them, I saw she had a picture of me on her mirror. I almost started crying, because I  really  look up to Kendra. It made me happy, and also it made me wish I had a picture of each one of my friends so I could put them where I can see them. I have a bunch of old pictures of kids from junior high. They're funny.&nbsp;I have 2 pictures of Miles Divers, I haven't talked to him in years. Well, I am being completely random still, I'm thinking that's probably a sign of hunger. So, off I go to eat.&nbsp;

       So, I just got back from getting my senior pictures taken.&nbsp; That... was a weird experience. I found myself getting uncomfortable... like, the whole time. I felt so stupid, and I looked at how a few of the pictures turned out... I just hope the others are better. Black and white always look better though, so I could just not get any color pictures, haha. I got to wear my rainbow shirt, it makes me smile and it was cool that they actually wanted me to use it. The drive home took waaaay too long, I couldn't believe how long it took. I listened to talk radio most of the time, because I need to "get with it" as far as current events go for Junior Miss. The topics didn't vary much all day long. There was a lot of talk on Martha Stewart and her prison sentence/house arrest, and some talk on the guy from Tillamook that killed his family and wanted to be&nbsp;his own lawyer or attorney or what not. But what I found the most interesting was all the talk on the presidential election. It seemed as though almost every caller was very liberal and strongly stood behind Kerry, but there were also a lot of Democrats who, despite being democrat, stand behind Bush. Then, the host of the show did this thing that was like, "Guess who said this" or something, and he'd say something to the effect of "Iraq having weapons of mass destruction is not acceptable and we have to get rid of Saddam Hussein, and the only way to do that is through war" or something, and everyone would, of course, think that Bush said that, but according to the radio host, Kerry had said it. I don't know where he found the quotes, but if I do find them, I'll let you all know, because I thought it was interesting. A lot of things were said that really made me think, I mean, I don't have any real strong opinions about either presidential candidate because I don't know enough about both of them to really say, but all of the stereotypes that I figured were true were proven false on the show. Quite a few callers completely stood behind Kerry, but when asked to back up what the had to say, they couldn't, they hadn't done their homework to find out where they were getting their information and whether or not it was true, or because the things they said weren't true, according to the host of the show. I don't know how bias the show was, but the host seemed to know what he was talking about, and everything he had to say made real sense, and it made me really think how many people are strongly one direction or the other and they&nbsp;really&nbsp;haven't taken the time to check out both sides before making a decision. At this point, I still don't feel like I have enough information to make a decision, but the guy on the radio really made some interesting points, and he also got me more interested in finding out my own views on the matter.  &nbsp;  Busy busy busy... there have been so many things I've wanted to do lately, but I can't, on account of being so busy! I don't think I would have it any other way, but sometimes I wish I could do what I want to do more often, as opposed to what I need or have to do. It's wonderful, though, when all three of those are the same thing.  &nbsp;  One&nbsp; funny thing (back to talk radio...) - they were discussing obesity in Portland, and the theme song for the segment was Backstreet Boys' "Larger Than Life". If&nbsp;only all songs could be that classic.     I visited Aimee at work today, she's working at the Nordstrom anniversary sale - it was crazy! There were SO many people there! And, an hour and a half long wait for the dressing rooms (unless you were like me and just used another department's dressing rooms - only in Brass Plum was it that crowded) but all the clothes were pretty scandalous or not my style at all.     [I'm just going to continue with my random thoughts - who needs organization anyway?] Rachel, your comment was really reassuring, it made me happy. Oh yeah, and I got your email, but I didn't reply. So&nbsp;hopefully I'll do that soon. You may kick me if I don't.&nbsp;You're great, thank you -     Can you all believe its Friday? The weeks go by so fast! I want to yell at it to stop, but I don't figure that does much good :)    I want ice cream. I've wanted it since I was driving home from senior pictures. I suppose I shall go out and get some. Anyone wanna come with?

      Today has been crazy. For a few months now, I've been so happy and content, and loving so many things. And though I have been frustrated here and there along the way, today has been the first day in such a long time that I can remember having a sour taste in my mouth about life. A few things were said to me today that made me think about how, though I work so hard to make myself a better person, people don't really see the person I'm becoming, they see the person I was or am trying to change from. That's kind of sad, but it just means it will be that much sweeter going to college! :)  I got to see Jennifer and Kara today, oh how I love those girls. I had a cool talk with Kara while driving her to Jenn's to pick up her car. I also met some really nice girls from Junior Miss, I'm even more excited to go now, especially if all the girls are that cool. Haha, and I got this awesome dress for my talent, woah nelly, it rocks. Its pink with white polka dots - I want to marry it. And I probably will.  I also got to see Sean McQuay, he's visiting from Texas (he moved there last summer). If you don't know him by name, maybe "I've tried to be mad..." rings a bell - I'm thinking probably only for Neil. It was weird, and my humor has changed a bit, so it was awkward a lot since we didn't have a whole lot to say. Aloha's yearbook though had something awesome in it - instead of pictures of the staff now, they have the staff's old high school pictures, I thought that was a great idea.  Ryan Pederson's blog is a lot deeper than mine. I'm not that poetic though, and I totally give him props for having so much to say. It almost makes me want to apologize to those of you who read my blog and think, wow this is crap. But now I'm thinkin, this is me, I'm not going to "reveal deep thoughts" or something just because I think it's cool when others do it. I will, however, let you all know that I just bought a pair of pants, and a suit! Yay! Haha, bye!

      Yesterday, I was listening to radio disney, and Hilary Duff literally had like, 5 songs on the top 30 countdown of the most requested songs of the week. They were  So Yesterday, Come Clean, Our Lips are Sealed, What Dreams Are Made of,  and  The Math . I think the only released song not on the countdown was  Why Not . Other random songs on the list were  Who Let the Dogs Out , and  Blue (dabadee-dabadi).  But the greatest part of it all, was that for the 3rd week in a row, Jojo's  Get out (leave)  was NUMBER ONE!!. Yeah! Jojo rocks! As well as Radio Disney. Well, the Hendrickson's are coming over for dessert and FHE, so be sure to check back next week for a recap of Radio Disneys Weekly top 30 ;-)

      I was going to write in response to all the comments that were left for my last entry (thanks guys :)) but I was trying to think of a response to Lenny's comment, and I started confusing myself, as usual. So here we go - Is stress a choice?   With happiness, its not like you have to be laughing and smiling all the time, but feeling contentment and peace, being okay with yourself. Not being hostile, bitter, unpleasant,  unhappy , etc. But it's not like, the opposite of feeling sadness, because it's okay to feel sad sometimes. True happiness is joy, anyway. One can be sad and still have joy. Maybe its the same way with stress, one can feel stressed and still have joy. And that's true, because though I am stressed, I'm at peace with myself, if that makes any sense. I know that there's more to what I'm doing here than me (again, if that makes sense). If this is true, and if that's what Lenny means, then the thought wouldn't really apply to me, would it?  Though, I agree to the extent that, you can't let stress catch up to you, its all about how you handle it and reduce it, which would then be considered, a good point made by Lenny, if that's what he was meaning to say. Stress can be a good thing, though, it helps you get things done. I know that especially for school projects and stuff, I leave it till the very end because it just... turns out better that way.  However, not knowing what Lenny really means could mean that I'm uselessly rambling on about nothing important, because he could mean something completely different. So, Lenny, if you'd like to clear the confusion (or, attempt to), I'd greatly appreciated it. I'd love to hear what you have to say.  In other news, Andy Musser is freaking hilarious.  I don't know where that 'other news' thing came from, although it might have something to do with the fact that I saw Anchorman yesterday. I thought it was hilarious, though someone else who saw it thought it was dirty. I would think I would be pretty observant about... things that make people uncomfortable, because when it comes to movies, I'm usually the first to go. But I just thought it was funny, so, who really knows.   I just decided that I dislike discussing matters such as the one I talked about earlier on a blog. I don't think I'll be doing that after today, I feel like it's so one-sided, and now I'm curious as to what Lenny means, but at the same time, I don't want to know, because I don't want to think about being stressed anymore. Also, I don't like it because I feel like it's a complaint to everyone, and that I'm wasting people's time with things I wouldn't normally discuss with them. So I guess it's stupid for me to even have one of these blogs isn't it? Yeah, pretty much. I'd get rid of it, but on the days when I'm not such a downer, I amuse myself with random, useless conversation. Wheeee!  Alright, I'm gonna go eat. PS - Jennifer, I love you, and also - I decided that I'm excited for junior miss, even if things don't turn out very well, haha. I'm excited to spend a week with you and Kara! SO MUCH FUN! YAY I'm excited.   The end.

      I wonder if admitting that I'm stressed is a magnet for more stress. It seems as though telling someone I'm stressed causes them to feel an uncontrollable urge to add on to it. Like, they feel left out or something because they haven't added on their fair share yet. The past few times I have admitted being stressed to certain people, it's like they forget that just a little while earlier I told them that I am stressed and they mistake it for other things. I just adore it when that happens.  So, this is me not admitting that I've got so much on my mind right now, that I've got too much to do and not nearly enough time or energy. I'm, of course, not saying that I feel that if I can just make it till when school starts, I'll be okay, because by then most everything will have passed, though I have a sinking feeling that it will only get worse.  I was talking to my friend Pete about how, because I can't add more hours to the day, I just have to prioritize the things I have to do with the things I need to do and the things I want to do, and at the end of the day, if I have time for anything else, then yipee for me. Yipee is such a nasty word, I think the guy who thought of it should be shot.  Anyway, I am not in any way saying that I am overly stressed or anything, but I am saying thanks to all those of you who aren't adding drama into my life right now, and also all of those of you who work at subway. Man, I love subway.  And now for something slightly less depressing :)  Some quotes from this thing!  I know it's just a song, but do you really think its possible to build a city on rock and roll?  -Sauron   Hey Jim, sometimes I wish I had my own theme park. But it's probably a lot of work. Never mind.  -General Lee   You know what I could go for right about now? A nice BLT. That would really the spot.  -Indiana Jones    What do you think? DiGiorno or Red Baron? Yeah you're right, DiGiorno isn't any good unless you can do that stupid "It's not delivery" line on somebody. heh  -Darth Vader     I really want a subway sandwich, now that I have talked about it. I mean, I had a wrap from there today, I just thought I would try it out. Yeah, I won't be doing that again, I decided I love bread too much. Yum, empty carbohydrates.  Well, I hope that was as entertaining for you as it was for me. Gnight all -

      Neil is one of the few friends I have stayed close with since junior high, even though we didn't even go to the same junior high. But over the years, we've had some great musical inspirations. I apologize for the rest of you, you needn't read this, seeing as you'll probably find it pointless, but Neil, I think this is a fairly complete list.   Get out (leave) - Jojo Candy - Mandy Moore This is me - Dream Hit 'em up style - Blu Cantrel Sorry Miss Jackson - Outkast Girl in the mirror - Britney Spears I'm not a girl - Britney Spears Everytime - Britney Spears Peices of me - Ashley Simpson I always liked that best - Cyndi Thomson Like Wow! - Leslie Carter So yesterday - Hilary Duff What Dreams are made of - Hilary Duff Never had a dream come true - S Club 7 Drowning in your love - Backstreet Boys Complicated - Avril Lavigne Only Hope - Mandy Moore A New Day - Celine Dion The boy is mine - Brandy/ Monica Irresistable - Jessica Simpson Fighter - Christina Aguilara Dirty - Christina Aguilara Mi Reflejo - Christina Aguilara 1000 Miles - Vanessa Carlton  Do you really want me - Robin Always be around - Robin Anything by P.M.S. ;-) Cause you're watching over me - Alexz Johnson What's goin' on - various artists  Haha, we have an inside joke for each of the songs, though some jokes we try to make not-so-inside, and no one thinks we're funny. But that's okay, we're MPGIS...  Haha, I'm outtie, Neil -

      I have come to the conclusion that Jojo and I are one in the same. This is why: 1. We both sing like we're black, but we're not (I don't think I sing like I'm black, but Jon and Devin think so, so obviously it must be true ;-) 2. We're both a Sagittarius 3. We both have obese BFF's named Terri 4. She's from Foxboro and I'm from Hillsboro - they're almost exactly the same! See, I AM Jojo.  And now for something completely different  Yay!  Michelle's list of bad/annoying things!   - ACTs - Overly dramatic girls... or, people for that matter... I know some pretty dramatic boys too - Unclean rooms, places, or people - Having to do my hair - Having to go shopping - Having to prepare a talent for Junior Miss  And now,  Michelle's list of good/happy things!   - Making jokes with friends during standardized test-taking - Friends who I haven't talked to in a long time that leave me happy messages on my blog, haha (Rachel, I will call you - yay for ACT scores and annoying parents!) - Friends who invite me to do cool things, like go to Portland to see an independent film - Friends who make movies about pirate kitchen utensils - Clean rooms - Brushing my teeth - Movies starring members of Nsync - Realizing that I actually have an idea of what I want to do with my life - Really good church meetings - Food. - Working out with my sister/cool friends - Kara Girod and Andrea Parson almost being home - Cake Batter Remix from Cold Stone - Sharing a whole bag of licorice ropes with my sister - Listening to Jojo and Blu Cantrel - Degrassi, and all my Degrassi friends - You know, I really could go on forever. But I won't. Basically, I'm just in a good mood, things are getting better, and also, Rachel left me a note! Haha, who knew such a small thing could cheer me up :)  Well, I have nothing relevant to say, obviously, so I am going to go clean out some boxes of books in my bedroom. I apologize if you actually read the list. I think I mostly wrote it, so that when I'm upset maybe I can look at it and remember that life is too short to be unhappy.   :)

      Oh Mandy Moore. Speaking of, Neil, I haven't talked to you in a while, call me okay?  I worked out pretty hard last night, and when I woke up I felt so good! I felt healthier (go figure) and even felt taller. I know that I'm not, but it was very cool.  I talked to Jonathan yesterday, that was really cool. He is going to see Rent BY HIMSELF today! I really want to see Rent, but I didn't have enough time to go with him. I hope he has a great time because I hear the musical is really good. I think next I will call Rachel. I hope she still has the same phone number - I haven't called her since junior high, but I called her all the time during elementary school, I still remember her number, or at least what I hope is her number still. Good times.  My brother has been trying to irritate me all morning, and needless to say it's sort of working. He does all this annoying stuff and then stares at me and waits for a reaction. I said, Do you need something? And he said no, but that didn't stop him. He's still goin at it. Oh how I love brothers.  I am cleaning my room and throwing out all this stuff that I thought I would want to save. Mostly it is stuff people have given me or done for me or what not. I keep what really means a lot to me and I throw everything else away. I feel kinda bad, its like I'm throwing away the memory. But not really, because they make my room messy. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and there isn't a cliche for sentimentality.  It bothers me when people make others feel stupid. Whether it be for something they said or not being as smart as them, like spelling or punctuation or something dumb, or something "not so cool" they did. I think making others feel like less than they are is completely unnecessary, and if I have ever made anyone feel stupid, I'm really sorry, and I promise I didn't mean to. Unless I did mean to, in which case... haha, kidding. But really, that's something I'm gonna work on, even though no one can make you feel inferior without your consent. Still, it happens, and it shouldn't.  My sister gets married a week from today!! I'm so excited for her, plus I will get to see so much of my extended family, and friends, and there will be a LOT of good food. This is such a pivotal moment in her life, and I'm glad that I can be apart of it. So, I will probably be really busy next week, or I wont be allowed to leave my mom alone with my grandparents. In any case, I don't know how much I'll be able to do next week, which is sad, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't call because I'd appreciate it.  Well, I'm off to go water the flowers. They are dying in the heat but I water them well, so THEY'D BETTER LIVE, DANG IT! :)

      I woke up this morning to help my mom work outside and plant some stuff before it got too hot, but I was too tired and went back to sleep. Now I am going to dance. I hope that I can help my mom before it gets too hot.  I like it when people don't suck.  I also like Aimee, my sister! Last night we went to an advanced showing of "The Princess Diaries 2: The Royal Engagement". I thought it would be okay, I mean, when we walked in they were handing out free hair ties. Wheeee! But the movie was very, very cheesy. Parts of it were good, funny or heart warming, but most if it basically sucked. One thing that was good was the very very good looking guy in the movie. He had brown hair and the coolest blue eyes. If he weren't in The Princess Diaries/too old for me, I might have had to hunt him down. Some bad things are, Raven was in the movie. And though Julie Andrews sings in the movie, RAVEN JOINS HER! SHUT UP RAVEN! NO ONE LIKES YOU! And PS - you're not African! Another bad thing was that everyone thought the movie was really funny, and I just didn't. So when others would laugh I would do my really loud old lady laugh, to spice things up. It was really funny, everyone around me was looking at me. And then one time I thought people were going to laugh so I did the old lady laugh but no one else laughed. It was really great :)  After the movie, I talked with Brittany Ewalt and some other awesome girls from Junior Miss who had also gone. That was really fun. Then Aimee and I went to Walmart!!  Then I got home and I had a party. And by party, I mean I cleaned my room. Or, I was supposed to. Anyway, I am off to plant some flowers. BYE

      There is a game commonly known as "Duck Hunt". I like to call it, The Game that Rocks. Because really, it is like, the best game ever made. If I become famous, I will be an advocate for the revival of duck hunt. I would probably also make a Duck Hunt movie. There would be ducks, and hunting, and all sorts of other neat things. Maybe the audience could get complimentary guns. Basically, Duck Hunt is pretty rad.

      I'm back from Junior Miss! YAY! First, I'd like to start off by saying that my good friend KARA GIROD is the 2005 Oregon's Junior Miss! She has announced me as her personal trainer. I am very excited about that!  I have a lot to say but I don't really feel like saying it all. So I'll just say a few things. I had a great time, we went to Nike which rocked. I seriously want an internship or something there.  Also, I have said 'seriously' and 'definitely' way too many times to count this week. The insanity must stop.  The girls were all pretty cool, and ALL of them had some amazing talent or personality trait, it rocked so hard. I got pretty close with a few girls...  Kellianne was my roommate, the one everyone wanted to meet because she is very good looking. She's really nice but was definitely there to win. And because I am the devil, I got a lot of pleasure out of telling her how amazing Kara is, knowing that she would then see Kara as serious competition. I also got a lot of pleasure when Kellianne placed second to Kara. Oh the joys.  ( I just reread that paragraph - I said serious and definitely... I  told  you I have a problem...)  Erin is an Mormon girl from Salem. She was really funny and I got along with her really well. There were four Mormon girls in the competition, yet only three modest dresses... curious. Anyway, Erin was a blessing to me because we held pretty much the same view of the competition, and she knows Addison! So, we get to hang out very soon :)  Sara and I constantly talked about mashed potatoes with garlic and potato salad. If you don't know what that means, you'll have to ask me in person sometime. We also talked about Lester the Molester, the guy who sang... and winked, and whispered in our ears and checked us out. He was the creepiest of the creepy and we were supposed to flirt with him on stage! I think not. We had a lot of fun talking about potatoes and Lester.  Jennifer got the overall scholastics award, and I was so proud of her! She works so hard for her grades, she deserves it. I overheard another girl talking about how she was kind of surprised she didn't get that award, and I just thought to myself, Jennifer probably won by a landslide.  My host family was a lot of fun. All week long their 14 year old boy had a thing for Kara. He didn't really but he thought she was pretty so we teased him about it. And I had a really cool conversation with my host mom, she has a very interesting perspective, especially about how my mom must feel and stuff.  Sil said my interview went really well, which is great, coming from Sil. They kept giving me really hard questions, asking about voting and gay marriage and why I would ever want to go to BYU. I felt like I was defending myself the whole time. It turns out, the harder the questions the better interviewer they think you are. So, thats pretty freaking rad.  A lot of things rocked this week. Still, a lot of things did not. And it is odd how I have changed just by spending a week with a bunch of girls. I look at a lot of things differently and I really appreciate some things now. Like some of the friends I have here at home. But I will miss all the free stuff I got. Those were good times...    Sky rockets in flight... afternoon delight...

      I'm about to leave for a week. I'm going off to Junior Miss, and I won't be back till NEXT SUNDAY! Some things you should do while I am gone are, 1. Miss me, 2. Leave me rocking messages, 3. Eat, 4. Change your clothes, 5. See Napoleon Dynamite, and 6. Call me when I get back because I haven't much time to hang out with many people with all the crazies of Junior Miss - But then it will be over, and I won't have anything to stress about! Except I might have to stick around because then its my sister's wedding! But after that! Alright!   urlLink Patrick  is basically the most hilarious guy I know.  PS - Just so you all know, if you try and call me this week, I won't be home, and if you call my cell, I can't talk! Because it's against the rules! Which is why you should aaaalll call me when I get home! Yay!
