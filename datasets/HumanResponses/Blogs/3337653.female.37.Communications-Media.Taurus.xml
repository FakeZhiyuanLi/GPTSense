      It could just as easily have taken place anywhere in the United States because I was driving my Jetta on the right side of the road. But in my dream last night, I was driving to London's Heathrow Airport at night (in unusually light traffic, I might add) when men standing along the road started flashing lights at the passing cars. I vividly remember the lights looked like a smaller, two-light version of a traffic signal, only white. When other cars stopped in the middle of the road and their drivers got out of the cars, I did the same. I asked someone what was going on and a man told me we were to kill the lights of our cars and lie down on the ground. He said it was a signal from the blackout days World War II to alert citizens that a bombing was imminent. Lights should be doused and people should take cover. While I understood we were in the middle of some sort of terror attack on London, I wasn't sure why we were being instructed to lie down, exposed, in the middle of the highway, but I did so. The first aircraft was a helicopter, which I saw rise from between two sections of the highway and explode. It wasn't close enought to me to be a danger. Then second helicopter lifted up and exploded. The third was a small, commuter-sized airplane, which lifed off over the highway then exploded. Again, not close enough to be a danger to me or the others lying on the highway, but frightening. While at the time I didn't know what sort of damage the explosions created or how many people might have been killed, the size of each aircraft made me wonder if these particular terrorists might not have been the most intelligent of the lot. After the plane explosion, I stood up and said that I wasn't going to lie out in the open anymore.  While others around me protested, others followed me to the edge of the road. We crawled down an embankment and ended up hiding beneath rows of grapevines in a vineyard, where we found ourselves among a group of United States soldiers. They told us we shouldn't be there, but took us to a shelter where we stayed the rest of the night. Then I woke up.

      Most days I spend with Caroline are fun, and today was no exception. It began with us jamming to Bob Marley and the Wailers "Legend" on the way to the Westlake soccer tournament. The tournament started yesterday, but I couldn't go because I had to work, so one of the other girl's mother took Caroline along. They won one game and lost the other yesterday. So, now that you're up to speed, the team lost their first game this morning. That wasn't such a bad thing, but what  was  a bad thing was the mother of one of our players who was under the impression that she was the coach. She yelled instructions, and loudly pinpointed everything the girls did wrong, even when they did what she had loudly proclaimed earlier would be the "right" thing to do. I tried to be tactful, but I told her that A. the girls are too busy playing to listen to her, and B. all parents should get out onto the field sometimes and experience what it feels like to have people coming at you because you have the ball, and then try to dump it off  to a teammate  before someone steals it. You know what she said? "I know they're not listening, but it makes me feel better." Dumb bitch. During the break between games, Caroline and I went to McDonald's for lunch, where we OD'd on Happy Meals just to get the mini plushie Neopets -- her latest favorite thing. From there, we went to Borders, where I picked up a copy of "Wicked" by Gregory Maguire. I'll let you know how it is. After that, we stopped at the tournament HQ to buy Caro a tournament T-shirt before heading to the fields for the second game. They lost, but were appeased by the participation trophies they received. When the tournament ended, Caroline and I went to the Build-a-Bear Workshop, where she selected, stuffed, groomed, named and dressed in soccer attire, a Border Collie plushie, aptly named "Mia." I bought Scott a pair of jeans at Aeropostale (with the promise of cutting off the label if they fit), but they are too tight for his fat little ass, so back they go. Mexican dinner, stop by mom's to tell her about the tournament and then home. One of the neat things from the tournament was a tradition of teams trading patches after each game. Because we're just a little ghetto team, our girls didn't have patches to trade, but came home with patches from two of the teams they played. So, now I'm off to sew them on. And if you happen to be wondering what I'm planning for tomorrow, the answer is  nothing . Absolutely nothing. Happy Memorial Day.

      I'm really glad during the graduation I covered this morning for the paper, none of the three valedictorians uttered the words "the best four years of our lives." Oh, sure, we got leaving footprints, embarking on a journey, making the world a better place and using education as a map to success. Fortunately, however, we didn't have to hear about how high school is the best time of your life. Because those of us who have been there, done that know better. College beats high school hands down, but that's still not the best time of your life. Your wedding day... even with a bad perm and a dress you would never choose again, if given the choice, wedding days still eclipse high school. Buying your first house... pretty damn cool, too. But nothing, absolutely nothing can compare with the moment you greet your first child. When it happens, both of you are tired and crying, neither particularly attractive... but that moment, for me, was the best time in my life. Remember high school fondly for they were, indeed, very good years. And that sunscreen tip? Yeah.

      If I had $100 that I didn't have to use for bills or groceries, I would buy, 100 bucks worth of:   Candles, in all the sizes and scents I like. CDs or DVDs that I've been meaning to buy. Flip flops, in every color imaginable. Tickets to see 311 this summer. Girly stuff. Lotions, gels, hair thingies, sparkly stuff. Beer. Lots of beer. From all over the world. A GPS for geocaching. Books. stuff from IKEA. It doesn't matter  what  stuff. Just stuff. It's all good.  I'm sure there are more things I would buy, but that's a start. What would  you  buy?

      I have a confession to make. Today I'll be wearing the same pants to work that I wore yesterday. I hate doing it because it makes me look like a hick, but these are the only pants I have that when I look in the mirror I don't want to cry. I started eDiets yesterday because I just can't go it alone, but that doesn't help today when I look in my closet and nothing fits.

      Once every 17 years. Bah. That's  nothing . I scoff at cicadas. You want a formidable insect opponent? Try this:   And not just every 17 years. No. How does  every  year grab you? All winter the larve bide their time until spring. Then they develop into 5,324,946, 295 mayflies, which fly out of Lake Erie, have sex, then find a surface to latch onto. Cars, streets, trees, dogs, little old ladies... you name it, they'll stick to it. After that, they die and dry up, leaving their exoskeleton still clinging. One year it was so bad, they had to break out snow plows to shovel the carcasses away. Cicadas? You people have it made.

      I was going to clean the house today. I'd planned it around lunch with Mom. But from Damon's we went to the library for a couple of videos for her to show the little kids in her school library. Then we parked downtown and poked around in the shops. In the antique store, we talked about how when I was little, I saved up my money and went to Grant's department store to buy Mom an awful Carnival glass (or perhaps Carnival glass-like) bowl that looked like half a watermelon with legs. In retrospect, the thing was positively hideous, but I remember how beautiful I thought it was so I  had  to buy it for her. We stopped at the coffeehouse to buy muffins for the kids, went to the furniture store and she told me about how one empty store front used to be the finest dress shop in town. Some of the windows still have displays from the shop after the finest dress shop in town, but nothing has been in there for at least 25 years. When my stepdad ran for state representative in the early 80's he rented the old store for his campaign headquarters. While we were supposed to be licking envelopes, my stepsister and I found old lipsticks, manequins and wigs in the backroom. Mom and I picked up the kids from their schools, so by the time she dropped us off at home it was nearly 3 p.m. I managed to get some of the trim painted in the living room this morning, as well a load of dishes, a load of laundry and some vacuuming done. But even if I'd done nothing but spend time with my mom, I'd call it a success. ... I spoke today with the managing editor of the Florida newspaper to which I sent my resume. She said she had not started going through the stack of resumes on her desk, but she remembered my name. I'm not sure what that means, but I'll take it as a good sign, k?

      My life is just too boring to write about. Sunburn. New capri pants. Skate competition photos coming soon to a website near you. Today I have to find an auto insurance company who will allow us to pay in installments. See, our current company used to allow us until we had a bit of trouble and couldn't keep up with the payments. So because we had trouble paying, their wisdom said the best way to get the money out of us is, naturally, to make us pay the premium in full. Right. If I can't pay the installment, how do you expect me to pay in full? The last time, we made our children eat gruel and scrub the kitchen floor for six months so we could pay the bill. I just threw that scrubbing part in because I didn't feel like doing it. Don't tell them, mmkay?  This just in:  It's cool. We can go on an automatic payment plan. Whew. So, now it's time to get back to my boring life. Catch ya later.

      I spent the entire morning at the soccer fields. Both kids' teams won, with Scott scoring 3 of 5 goals for his team and Caroline stellar at defense for her team. Rock on, kiddos! From there we went downtown for a skateboard competition. Scott wasn't competing, but it was so cool to watch. I took a whole roll of shots on the Fed and probably half a roll on the lomo. So stay tuned.

      I had a dream last night that Phil, Caroline and I were riding in his van. He'd put it on autopilot and we were all sitting in the back, talking. At one point, I realized we seemed to be going at a rate of speed that was too fast for a city street. I looked forward and I noticed that there were flares in the road and a barricade on the other side of the rapidly approaching intersection. On the other side of the barricade was a construction crane that we would surely hit if we didn't stop or turn. I ran up to the driver's seat, but just as I dropped into the seat, the van slammed head-on into the crane. I woke up just at that instant. ... It was confirmed to me today that 13-year-old boys are, in fact, morons. I called the guidance counselor at the local junior high school to find out when honors night will be. Typically, I send a photographer to the event and then we run the list of award winners afterward. The counselor was perplexed, wondering why I hadn't received the event handout that was sent home with all the students, one of whom is my son. Hellooo, we're talking about 13-year-old boys here. Particularly  my  13-year-old boy who forgets permission slips, gym shorts, lunch tickets and school pictures. Talking further with the counselor, however, I know why Scott conveniently "forgot" about honors night. Students are not allowed to wear jeans or shorts to the event. They must dress up, which for Scott is akin to having his fingernails pulled out with pliers. But, this is one of those times when it really sucks to have a mother who is a reporter. Not only do I know about honors night, but I know about the dress code. And there ain't no gettin' out of it. So how are you today?

      The spiders were roused from their winter slumber this morning when I fired up the long-unused Nordic Track. Sorry, spiders, the scales tipped this morning at a weight I haven't seen in a very long time. A weight beyond the scope of my regular justification. "Oh, it's only X over my pre-London weight. I can lose that quick." Which, of course, I never do. But today's number was one that said (quite loudly, I might add) that if I don't modify my current behaviors I'll find myself back to my start weight, which was over 200 pounds. Frightening, sobering, motivating thought. Especially after finding a photo of myself at a pub in London.   Certainly not the most flattering image of me ever (a warning for the harmful effects of too much Guinness at one sitting) but I was fit, damn it! So, spiders, this is your only warning. You'll have to find another home.

      Ordinarily I wouldn't see 4 a.m. on a Monday morning when I have work in less than a handful of hours. I can only blame the Mexican food for part of that. Sitting here with nothing to do and hours in which to do it, I wrote a short story. I've e-mailed it to Bob -- He's shared his with me, so I wanted him to be the first to read mine -- and later I'll link to it here. After I've had some sleep.

      I'm fairly certain that Mexican food is the Creator's way of punishing me for some past transgression. A sort of epicurean karma come back to get me. And  every  time I go for Mexican food I end up feeling this way. I just never learn.

      After frozen pizzas, the kids and I watched "Master and Commander" on DVD. It was very well-done, but the doctor excepted, I didn't really warm up to any of the characters. Despite being a two-hour film, it didn't feel as if we had time to get to know and love them, even Russell Crowe's character. Afterward I watched "Love Actually," which, actually, also left me a little... lukewarm. The Colin Firth storyline was sweet and silly and worth a few warm fuzzies, but the rest not so much. Hugh Grant as PM was quite a stretch for the old imagination. And Alan Rickman's character was too grey for a guy who typically plays black or white. P.S. And this has  nothing  to do with either film... if you haven't tried the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser, run out right now and get one. Those things are fan-fucking-tabulous!

      I'm not a big fan of cooking. No. That's not right. I love cooking. I adore cooking. I just hate washing up afterward, so I just try to avoid the whole thing completely. I also hate grocery shopping. But I've found a reason to do both: the new and improved world foods section at Kroger. Oh, I'm sure those fortunate enough not to live in East Bum Fuck (like me) might find my wide-eyed wonderment amusing. But until now the "ethnic" aisles at the local supermarkets around here have pretty much consisted of a few boxes of matzo balls, two dozen varieties of Old El Paso salsa and Kikkoman soy sauce, give or take a can of tripe and a tube of wasabi. At Kroger, though, we're talking a wide variety of stuff from all over the world. India, Japan, Scotland, France, Ireland, England, Italy, Jamaica, Germany, Turkey... I know I'm leaving some out. The best find, however, was:   And you know what that means, don't you? English breakfast next weekend. My house. Be there or be square.

      I was offered a job today that I really, really want. The problem (there's always a problem, isn't there?) is that I'd have to take about a $90/week pay cut... or find a part-time job to make up the difference. On the other hand, it has huge potential for job satisfaction. And this I know from first-hand experience. Not sure what I'm going to do, though.

      ... you scream. We all scream for ice cream. You'd scream too, if you ate as much ice cream as I did today. Scott, Caroline and I spent the entire day doing the grand tour of area ice cream shops for a story I'm doing for our FunC0ast tab, which runs on Fridays. At each place, we asked about the specialty or most popular item. We tried a banana split, peanut butter milkshake, C0bb's Cooler (which was a float made with slush), fresh strawberry sundae, orange/vanilla twist made with homemade orange sherbet, OSU Buckeye flurry, a Rocky Road cone and Flavor Blast ice cream cone (which is swirled with flavored syrup). We went to about 10 shops total, but could not bear to eat something at every place. There is, my friends, such a thing as too much ice cream. Miss Nesta is proving to be pretty good choice. She is still adjusting, so she hasn't said anything yet. But today she ventured from the highest perch to try a little of her fruit and vegetable seed mix. We're keeping her on top of the dresser in our bedroom, which provides a bit of seclusion, as well as keeps Sonic from sticking his big fat nose against her cage and scaring the bejezus out of her. I get the impression that once she warms up to her new surroundings and people, she's going to be a feisty little bird.

      You know how I told myself that parakeets are messy little beasties? We know own two Australian Shepherds, a red betta called Aku and a little green budgie called Nesta. I so totally caved.

      Caroline and I picked up some treats for the doggies today, as well as a toy rope for Hinckley. See, Sonic is a toy hog. He has two plush soccer balls, a purple racquetball and a plush Cookie Monster. Hinckley would play with the ball if Sonic didn't steal it. Consequently, Hinckley has been toy-less pretty much since we got Sonic. When we got home, Caroline took Sonic outside, while I played tug-o-war with Hinckley until he wore out. It didn't take very long. He's old and out of shape, kind of like  me  Phil. Heh. We also picked up a new betta fish with intentions of doing the betta vase thingies we'd done with Samurai Jack. But after reading on the 'net how it's really not a good environment for the fish, Caroline and I cleaned out an old goldfish bowl and are prepping it to be a new home for Aku.   While at the pet supply shop, watched the parakeets playing. When we were dating, Phil and I had two, called Louie and Ziggy. Louie was a blue 'keet, named for my favorite college bar. Ziggy, a green bird, was named for Ziggy Marley. We gave the birds to a nice lady in Michigan, after we'd signed a lease on a rental house. As adorable as parakeets are, they are very messy little beasties. I really need to keep that in mind, since I was  very  tempted to take one home with me.

      I ripped open the USPS package today in eager anticipation of the French Connection skirt I had every intention of wearing to work because it was just so darn khaki and cute. However,  skirt  is not quite what I would call it. Scrap of fabric with great big buttons that barely covers my ass is more like it. Needless to say, I will  not  be wearing the skirt to work anytime soon. Also disappointing was the French Connection polo shirt I ordered for Phil. It's everything the seller claimed it was. Unfortunately, Phil's body isn't.

      It's difficult to maintain an interesting journal when you ain't got no drama, but I'm not going to write about work right now.  Nor am I going to talk about other opportunities that may or may not be presenting themselves to me right now. But I can tell you that Phil is hating  his  boss right about now.  What is it, asshole season?

      Phil called a marina in Florida Wednesday that recently changed owners. He had a conversation with one of the women in the office, who told him they will be looking for a manager about six months from now. Do you know how perfect that would be? We'd have time to get the house finished, on the market and get our stuff packed up. Phil's going to call the owner and fax his resume, so pray to the diety of your choice and keep your fingers crossed, k?

      Phil said last night I was asleep with my arm stretched to the night table, my fingers tapping on the tabletop. He said I did it for about 20 minutes. I wonder what was up with that. ... Yesterday morning, Phil was awakened by some guys on a cell phone who said they found our phone number scrawled on a piece of paper, at the local amusement park's wave-action pool. One guy told him, "You shouldn't leave your phone number at Soak City." Still half-asleep, Phil thanked him, hung up the phone and went back to sleep. When he really woke up, he found the number on our caller ID and called the guys back. They were heading home after spending Tuesday at the amusement park. While in the wave-action pool, they found the piece of paper in the water. It had been folded about eight times. The one guy said they found it strange to find a piece of paper with nothing but a phone number on it. So they called. We were baffled. Who would have taken our phone number to Cedar Point? Who did we give our number to recently? We couldn't come up with a reasonable explanation. So we assumed that the water had smudged the numbers, making it  look  like our phone number. At lunch yesterday, we explained the mysterious events to the kids. After considering, Scott announced that he had the answer to the mysery. As it turns out, he wrote our phone number on a piece of paper for one of his best friends, who had previously lost the number.  And later that day, Brian went to Soak City. ... Yes, indeed, my life is really really boring.

      Friday: Spent the entire night on the couch watching television and feeling sick. Saturday: Sent Scott off to Hoover Sailing Club for a regatta in the morning, then spent the rest of the day shopping with Caroline. I bought Phil a pastel lime green shirt and  he liked it.  Armageddon is sure to begin at any moment. Sunday: Slept until 4 a.m., played games on the computer until 7 a.m., went back to bed until noon. Still not 100%. Met my 4-year-old niece today for the first time. Brother-in-law has three daughters with three different women and is just beginning to have visitation time with the middle girl. She's a sweetie, but I expect today was really overwhelming for her. Bought the newest Starsailor album today, too. Two thumbs up. Now: Off to watch the rest of Amelie (again).

        I left my flat iron plugged in for three days. Unfortunately, my ugly bathroom did not catch fire.  Luden's Throat Lozenges were the perfect way to get away with eating candy at school.  Sandals on a rainy day when you have a cold... not a good idea.  When you tell your 13-year-old son that you "just bid on whatever jeans were sized 29x30 on eBay," you can get away with making him wear Lucky and Old Navy brands.  What exactly is wrong with eating chips and sandwiches and Ramen noodles everyday for lunch? My son seems to think he has to have some variety at lunchtime. What does he think I am? A school cafeteria?  I want to see The Chronicles of Riddick. Not because it looks interesting or because I'm a Vin Diesel fan. It's all about the Karl Urban, baby.  Thanks to  urlLink jennyj , I discovered  urlLink Tube Gossip  which made me laugh and laugh and laugh.  I'm going home now. Catch ya later.

      Against my better judgement, I came to work today. I still could use another day to recover, but I didn't want to push it with my boss. Everything was hunky and dory until a guy stopped in the lobby (note to self: never, EVER, answer a call from the lobby again) to show us a letter written by a Large Area Amusement Park (henceforth, LAAP) to outside marine contractors. LAAP will no longer allow outside contractors to service boats in the marina because LAAP has a service agreement with a Local Service Facilty (LSF, you get the idea) that gives LSF exclusive right to provide services at LAAP docks. Whether or not this is legal, ethical or just not very nice doesn't really matter. The issue I have is that Phil works for LAAP and is a former employee of LSF. Editor is satisfied that because lobby guy gave us the information, Phil should not suffer any repercussions. I hope she's right because tomorrow the story's going to have my byline on it. Oh, and by the way, I didn't get the city editor gig. I kinda expected I wouldn't and I'm not bothered that I didn't. I case you were wondering.

      I received a phone call last night from the city editor, wondering if I would be okay to come to work today because without my Campbell School story, they have no Sunday C-Cover. God forbid they don't have a Sunday C-Cover because I'm  sick ! I told her that I was going to take half a sick day today and then go cover the last day of Campbell School. It's a historic old school that is closing after the last day of school today. But dammit, I'm sick. Vertical is not something I can accomplish for an extended period of time. I'm coughing my head off. My throat is swollen. And yet I feel  guilty  because without the story, the paper doesn't have a Sunday C-Cover. How is that  my  problem?!

      The worst thing about taking a sick day when you're actually sick is... well... being sick. It's different when I take a sick day when Caroline's sick. I can clean the house, snuggle with her on the couch, get a load of laundry done. But today, I don't feel like doing any of those things. Snuggling on the couch excepted. I slept until 10 a.m. and had some bizarre Nyquil-induced dreams that I don't really remember. I have vague memories of standing up to some Nazi-esque organization trying to hinder my freedom of religion... and hot boys. In the same dream. Not sure what that was all about, but I kinda liked it.

      We went to the new Japanese restaurant tonight for dinner and it was fantastic. The restaurant is well-decorated, the sushi was fresh and delicious and I was tempted to take the whole table home with me because it was just so pretty. What was surprising was how many familiar faces we saw. Most of them were waiting for hibatchi, but it was a nice turnout for the first night. Because the closest Japanese restaurant is nearly an hour a way, it was so refreshing to leave the house 15 minutes before our reservation time, enjoy a leisurely meal with friends and not have to worry about a long drive home. Scott sailed in a regatta today in Toledo, where they finished third in the Thistle class. There were only four boats, but it still meant hardware. And since the sailing club is called Jolly Roger, he brought home a great third place flag with a skull and crossbones. I happened to drive by a garage sale today after soccer and on a whim decided to see what they had. Most of it was crap, but I found a retro-looking barstool that has chrome legs, a slatted wooden back and vinyl covered seat. The seat and foam beneath were ripped, but I'm going to go all Trading Spaces on it and recover the seat with some funky fabric. Eventually.

      Loved it. Loved it. Loved it. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but my only disappointment was that something from the book didn't make it into the film. Still... see above.

      Randy and I had a groove. He'd play the straight guy, I'd be the sarcastic one. He'd give the opportunity, I'd take the jab. Our listeners ate it up. And I know they'd love the whole Bob Newart-ness of me taking the job of the girl who replaced me. The timing is off. The staffing at the station has been slashed, leaving no money for me. Then there's the whole moving to Florida thing. The way my luck works, I'd get a call from a Florida newspaper the week after I accepted the morning show gig. It just doesn't feel right.

      I received an e-mail this morning from my former on-air partner at the radio station. The girl who replaced me is leaving and he wanted to know if I'd be interested in coming back. She told him I might be.  I am. I really, really am. The problem is that I'd have to take a pay cut to do it. That is worrying. Not because I think I'm worth more.  I am. . I just can't afford it. Clyde says I should just get a part-time job on the side to supplement. Maybe doing something else I really love. That's not a bad idea. In fact, it's a great idea. I want to consider this.

      I was going to regale you with tales of how I exfoliated my feet last night while watching the "What Not to Wear" marathon on TLC, but really... how boring would that be?  Instead, to anyone tempted to lean over to a friend and whisper -- behind the shade of a hand -- that my trousers look a little bulgy around my hips today: I already know. But if I had to wear those stone-colored capri pants one more day, there's no telling what types of unspeakable horrors I may have committed. Besides, I'm wearing a low-cut shirt today, which leads me to  Trish Fashion Tip #1 :  Dazzle 'em with boobage and they'll forget all about the saddlebags.

      Mimi was right. I loved Cold Mountain. I am not a Nic0le Kidman fan, so her presence in the film bugged me a little. I can see why she'd have been chosen for the role, however. She's got that delicate, pampered Ada look about her. I thought Jude Law was well cast, too. In any case, what had been a book that moved too slowly for my taste, turned out to be an excellent film.

      Curses to fcuk for marking down&nbsp;the skirt I want to what seems a very tempting £25. Add shipping and conversion at the current rate (about 55 cents), it would cost $63. Not so tempting anymore, huh?  ::cue whining:: But I  want  that skirt! I  need &nbsp;that skirt! Don't you want me&nbsp;to look good? Don't you&nbsp; care  about me?&nbsp;&nbsp;::end whining::  I got that whine off a little boy at Perry's Cave last week. His mom had given him $5 to spend on anything in the gift shop. First he found some little trinket that fell in his price range, eagerly showing it to her. She told him he could afford it, but he wanted to go back and keep looking. Just so&nbsp;he didn't miss the souvenir. You know how it goes. A few minutes later he came back and told her he found a vest that he really wanted. He told her the price was "six two five."&nbsp;She said it was too expensive. "Don't you want me to look good?" he asked. "Don't you care&nbsp;if your son looks nice?" He was smoooooth. I have to give the mom credit. She stood firm. Me? I'd have folded faster than a house of cards over $1.25.  And I really do want that skirt.

      Over the weekend I signed on for the Movie Pass at Blockbuster, which is similar to Netflix. While I don't get the films delivered directly to my door, the Blockbuster is less than a mile from my house on the road that goes right past my street. I'm not  that  lazy. So far I've seen: James and the Giant Peach - this was a Caroline pick that I'd seen in the theater with Scott when he was little. It's a family favorite and I just  love  Joanna Lumley as Aunt Spike. Starsky & Hutch - I'm not a big fan of Ben Stiller, or Owen Wilson, for that matter. While I wouldn't say this was one of the best movies I've ever seen,&nbsp;when Snoop Dogg says, "Found your nine iron, bitch" and clocks Vince Vaughn with a golf club? I'm  still  laughing at that. 50 First Dates - I was surprised to find myself really liking this one. Adam Sandler was (oddly) endearing, Drew Barrymore was adorable&nbsp;and, of course, the soundtrack kicked ass. Bringing Down the House - When this movie came out, I found myself strangely attracted to it, but I didn't see it. My curiosity was piqued again when it first came out on DVD, but still I didn't see it. With it falling after 50 First Dates in the alphabetical layout at Blockbuster, I gave it a shot... and I liked it. Chasing Liberty - Anne Hathaway was successful with the regular girl becomes a princess thing in "Princess Diaries." Amanda Bynes was cute as a button being the American girl in London in "What a Girl Wants." Then it started getting out of control... Hillary Duff in Rome and Mandy Moore as the president's daughter in Prague. I'm sorry, but I just could not buy  any  guy, especially a secret service agent, falling for Mandy Moore's character after a couple of days. Tonight's movie is Cold Mountain, which Phil picked after having heard it was a Civil War movie. When I read the description that it's about a wounded soldier making his way back to the woman he loves, Phil decided he might not want to watch that after all. I'm not all that keen on it myself... so I'll let ya know.

      Because  urlLink Supa Jen &nbsp;said so, here's what I did on my summer vacation:  Sunday: My father-in-law,&nbsp;brother-in-law, Caroline and I sailed over in the afternoon, arriving at  urlLink Put-in-Bay  about 4 p.m. After getting us secured to a mooring ball in the harbor, FIL and BIL caught the first ferry home, while Caroline and I got settled.&nbsp;We ran into Scott, who had sailed over with his teammates earlier in the day, at the  urlLink yacht club . All the teams were there for introductions, instructions and dinner, so Caroline and I&nbsp;ate at  urlLink The Boathouse &nbsp;before heading back out to the boat for the evening.  Monday: While Scott was crewing aboard a  urlLink Thistle  in the  urlLink I-LYA Junior Sail Regatta , Caro and I did the local history thing. See, PIB is steeped in family history for Phil's family. His great-granddad and two brothers were prominent islanders in the early days. Several of the family homes and businesses are still standing. So we visited the  urlLink historical society ,&nbsp;rode our bikes around to see all the different buildings, to the cemetery and went up in  urlLink Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial . From up there, we could see the different race courses set up between the islands, but it was impossible to tell at that height which was Scott's boat.&nbsp;The days have sort of blended a little, but I'm pretty sure I had some of the famous lobster bisque at  urlLink The Boardwalk  on Monday. And I went to a cocktail party, arriving just in time for a glass of lousy island wine.  Tuesday: We took in the island's biggest tourist trap --  urlLink Perry's Cave . While I could think of more exciting things to do than shell out $9.50 to spend 30 minutes in a chilly, damp crack in the ground, Caroline loved it. Even more, she loved spending $5 a pop to "mine" for gemstones and arrowheads. Get this racket: You buy a bag of sand, take it out to the front lawn where they have a sluice set up, dump the sand into a sieve and shake it around in the water until the gems and arrowheads (all which have been planted in the bag of sand) are revealed. Of course, she is thrilled with her little chunks of citrine, garnet, peridot and quartz... so I guess it wasn't a total waste, eh?   Phil brought the powerboat over Tuesday evening and I have to admit I was really glad to see him. See, the first time I ever saw him was on the island, so it's kind of "our" place. And except for one day last fall when I went over to take some lomoshots one morning, I haven't been to Put-in-Bay without&nbsp;him for nearly 16 years. We had sushi and beers for dinner, then stopped in at Tony's for&nbsp;ice cream and beer. Scott was with us for a bit, but then went back to hang out with his teammates. We took Caroline to the water taxi, which delivered her to the boat for the night. After I knew she was settled in with "Molly Moon's Incredible Book of Hypnotism," Phil and I went to get our drunk on. So in the entry below, where I showed the photos of the places I was going to drink... that pretty much sums it up.  Wednesday: We spent the morning on the water, watching the races. Monday and Tuesday had been qualifier days for the Championship and the Commodore fleets. Scott's boat didn't make the cut into the Championship fleet, so they were sailing in the Commodore fleet races on Wednesday and Thursday. I'd like to say they did well... but they didn't. They had lots of things they did right. It just wasn't enough to propel them into contention for hardware. At lunchtime, Phil dropped Caroline and I off on the island -- she'd had enough of the waves -- and we rode our bikes around the island more and did some browsing in the shops. At Del Sol, we bought this awesome nail polish that changes color in the sun, going from a coral-y pink to purple. We were barely out of the shop before we painted our toenails.  In the evening, all the team members and their parents gathered for a party in the backyard of  urlLink Aunt Jane's Victorian Manor , which is owned by the aunt of two of the kids on the sailing team. Phil and I were assigned to "fire watch" at the hotel where all the teams were staying, so we went to the hotel first. There were three teams of two assigned to each fire watch shift. Our primary job was to make sure the kids weren't causing any trouble and to keep the boys out of the girls rooms and vice versa. We were&nbsp;relieved for a short time by a couple of guys from our club so we could go to the party for awhile, but&nbsp;went back to the hotel after about 30 minutes. When our shift ended, two of the three sets of replacements arrived, so we volunteered to wait in the girls' hall until the final set arrived. About waiting ten minutes beyond the official start of the next shift, we were beginning to wonder where our replacements were. Finally, Phil went out into the lobby to find two women sitting in the armchairs, reading books. I went out and asked them if they were on duty. "Yes," the one woman replied. I recognized the second one as having  walked right past us in the hall and did not tell us she was there to replace us . I asked if they wanted our chair in the hallway in order to keep an eye on things. The first woman said, "No. That's not something I choose to do." Gahhhhhhhh! Now, I'm no prude. Not by a long shot. So if she wanted to ignore the&nbsp;rules and let the kids do whatever the hell they want... so be it.&nbsp;But I was so pissed that the stupid bitch couldn't  choose  to let us know she was there before we fucking starved to death! By that time, the party was over and most of the restaurants had closed. We managed to get something at Mossback's before heading out to the boat to crash.  Thursday: Phil headed back home in the morning, while Caroline and I slept-in late. By the time we were up and showered, Scott had finished racing for the week. He hung out with us until My mom arrived on the ferry. We had pizza at Frosty's, then Scott went off to get ready for the closing awards banquet. Can I just&nbsp;tell you how handsome my&nbsp;boy -- who  hates  to dress up -- looked at the banquet wearing khaki pants, white shirt, navy blazer and tie?&nbsp; I know I'm biased, but he really did look so damn cute.  Near the end of the banquet, the thunderstorm that had been brewing out over the lake finally hit. So Caroline, Mom and I went back to the boat. Scott came for a short visit... I think preparing himself for the initiation that lay ahead.  Friday: At 8 a.m. I called for the water taxi to get Caroline and I to the registration table for the I-LYA Optimist Championship, a 1-day regatta for  urlLink Optimist  sailors. I didn't really think anything of it when the driver told me he was already heading my way. When the taxi arrived, Scott was aboard with all his gear. Checkout at the hotel wasn't until 9 a.m., but he had gathered his things as soon as he woke up and left. As the day progressed, we found out it was because he had to drink water from one of his teammate's sailing boots. There aren't any circumstances under which drinking from a funky old sailing boot is pleasant, but for some reason the entire thing pissed Scott off. After tossing his cookies, he launched a four-letter tirade at his roommates, then stormed out of the hotel after curfew. He walked to Perry's monument where he "threw his guts up" and in the process, lost his flip-flops... which he was wearing because the day before,&nbsp;he'd managed to&nbsp;drop one of his Chuck Taylor high tops overboard while on our boat. Barefoot, he went back to the hotel, where he passed the night and broke camp as early as possible. "I wanted to get away from those fuckers," he told me.  I feel for the kid... sort of.&nbsp; I mean, he knew all week that something like this would happen. But perhaps he thought that because his teammates think he's cool that he would somehow escape initiation. Or maybe he felt as if drinking "bootwater" is somehow worse than having an eyebrow shaved off.&nbsp; But I think he got over it, because later I heard Scott tell Phil the initiation that "they will talk about for years to come." Erm, ohhhkay.  In the meantime, Caroline entered the Opti regatta. Mom, FIL (who had arrived on an early ferry to take our boat back home) and I watched from shore. We couldn't really tell which boat was her, but we were pretty certain it was one of the boats near the back of the fleet. After three races, we saw one boat head back to the yacht club and realized it was Caroline. When we met her down there, she was wet and shivering. She told me she had dumped before the race even started. While her coaches were bailing her boat, one of the lines had gotten tangled in her mainsheet block, so she had little control over her main. I think sticking it out three races was a pretty good start to her racing career. And even after the results were tallied, she didn't finish last. So, go Caroline!  FIL and Scott sailed our boat back to Sandusky, while Mom, Caro and&nbsp;I waited around for the awards. Caroline thought they might give out participation awards... she said "precipitation," then laughed and corrected herself. I told her that since she had gotten so wet, she deserved a precipitation award, so I bought her a candy she liked... in lieu of the participation awards that weren't. From there, we caught the ferry home.  The end.  I"m sure there's stuff I forgot. And way more stuff than you probably wanted to know... but... there ya go.

      I didn't get a chance to post yesterday after my first day back on the air. It was seamless. Mind you, I didn't say flawless... but it felt as if I had never left. I'm not sure our listeners grasped the Newhart concept we were going for with my "reintroduction," but I did get a few callers saying it's good to have me back. It's good to be back.

       Ingredients: 1- urlLink island , sprinkled liberally with tourists, locals and a lot of family history. 1-30-foot sailboat called Fizgig. 1-nine-year-old girl with a freckled nose. 1-teenage boy. a pinch of rest a dash of relaxation a splash of alcohol. Frosty pizza, to taste. Directions:Add your favorite partner-in-crime on Tuesday and Wednesday. If desired, add your mother on Thursday and Friday. Mix well and enjoy. (I wanted to write a longer entry about my vacation but it started feeling like a travel brochure.) The main reason we were there was because Scott was crewing on a Thistle&nbsp;in his first I-LYA Junior Sail Regatta. Overall, they finished second to last for the week, but Scott learned a few things about camaraderie, meeting girls and drinking water from an old sailing boot.

      For the next&nbsp;six days I will be on an island in the middle of Lake Erie that looks like this:   I will drink beer here:   Here:   And maybe even here:   Since I will be&nbsp;running strictly on&nbsp;island time -- no computers, no televisions and no schedules to follow -- I'll catch you this time next week.

      Today was perfect for the last day of work. I had the chance to interview Alice C00per and the CFO of the B0ston P0ps in peace. Don was the only person around when it was time to say good-bye. I have to admit there was an exhilaration to getting a story finished by deadline or the feeling of scooping the competition on a big story. I expect I'll forever be&nbsp;using my work&nbsp;as a litmus test for those who will fill the beat after me. I'll especially miss LaRaye and her incessant humming. I'll miss kibbitzing with Laura. I'll even miss the school board members. Going into the building will be strange from now on... familiar, yet no longer mine. But at least I now I know what's up those big stairs.

      I probably should have clarified. That tip? It came from a police record I&nbsp;read while doing cop rounds. It's not about me. I have no priors, no outstanding warrants. I'm&nbsp;higher above the legal drinking age than I care to admit&nbsp;and I'm married to my baby daddy.&nbsp;

      I dunno. I can't see Martha Stewart's stint in jail as anything but a good thing. Imagine the new products and colors. Jumpsuit orange and Cellblock grey paint;&nbsp;a whole new line of flatware comprised totally of&nbsp;spoons; and maybe brightly-colored dinnerware patterned after cafeteria trays. Too bad the handbags made out of license plates has already been done.&nbsp;

      It was brought to my attention last night on more than one occasion that Phil and I are, as those wacky youngsters say, "old." I suppose in comparison to the majority of the kids at the concert last night we are a little long in the tooth, but after thinking about it, I realized a couple of things: The average age of the people at last night's concert was about 19-20. Which means when 311 released their first album "Music" in 1993, those kids hadn't even gone through puberty. Even when they released their blue album in 1995 that put 311 on the map, those kids were still in middle school. It also means that the guys in the band are far closer to  my  decrepit age of 37 than 19-20. In fact, four of the five members of 311 were freshmen when I was a senior in high school. Now I'm not saying I'm some sort of  better  fan because I could have attended 311's first gigs without getting my mom's permission. I just prefer to think that instead of being "old," I'm old school.

      We arrived at Prom0west Pavili0n in Columbus shortly after the doors opened at 6 p.m. Because the tickets did not say exactly when the concert was actually going to start, I had been worried that the opening band would be started and all the good vantage points taken. Instead, we were among the first to enter and staked a claim in the mosh pit directly in front of stage right. The opening band was Medeski Martin and Wood, a three-man instrumental jam band. They were groovy and kind of Phishy, but despite the inventive use of whistles and animal calls by the percussionist, the 45 minute set stretched interminably. Had I been relaxing at home with a joint, I can't think of any band better than MMW, but we were ready for 311. Before the concert started, one of the security guards came over to us and asked if we were sure we wanted to stay in the pit. "You know what happens right?" he asked, looking skeptically at Caroline. "We've had some little girls get crushed."  I assured him we would be fine. I told him that the only way Caroline was going to get crushed is if they get through me first. The reactions around us were mixed. Some people thought we were nuts for letting a little girl in the pit. Others thought we were cool for bringing the kids to the show. While others were just pissed because we had a great spot and they couldn't get it. I stood behind Caroline with my hands on the rail on either side of her, forming a protective little pocket for her to stand in. Phil blocked from the left, Scott blocked from the rear (when he wasn't moshing) and a nice couple to the right blocked from that side. The moshing wasn't really a problem. The crowd surfers coming down right over our heads wasn't much of an issue, either. In fact, Scott did a little surfing himself. It was those damn little bimbos who felt they were entitled to push their way up to the front of the pit. A couple of them tried to squeeze between me and the people on the right. Tried being the operative word. I felt a little bit like Evelyn Couch (Kathy Bates) in Fried Green Tomatoes when she was at the supermarket, ramming the car of the girls who took her parking space. 'Member that? "Face it girls, I'm older and I have more insurance." I doubt  anyone  will be surprised when I say that 311 was terrific and being so close to the stage was amazing. They did a two-hour set, a mix of old and new, including a killer cover of Led Zeppelin's "D'yer Mak'er" and the famous drum solo all the guys do together. I'd have to say this concert definitely tops my list of all-time favorites. We were standing right in front of Tim, but S.A. wasn't far away and every now and then Nick made his way over to our side of the stage. I can't say for sure whether or not it was because of Caroline, but when Nick dove into the crowd near the end of the show, he did it at the other end. I reckon landing on a nine-year-old could have been unpleasant for all involved. The best part of the night, however, was at the very end. The band did their final song and said goodnight. Before he left the stage, Chad threw one of his drumsticks out into the crowd. It landed in front of the security guard nearest us and all the people around were clammoring for it. He put it in his pocket, but as the crowd started shuffling off, he gave it to Caroline. So. Awesome night, amazing show... and now the adrenalin rush is finally starting to subside.

      I've made several aborted attempts at this entry. I'm struggling because my feelings are still a little tender. In a good way. Just about a week ago, my mom went to her friends' house for a couple of beers. While she was there, she met a deputy sheriff nearing retirement and his wife. When my mom told Joe that her first husband had been a deputy sheriff as well, he recognized the name. He told Mom that when he first started with the department, he'd asked the sheriff the significance of a plaque hanging in the office. The plaque was one my mother had bought in honor of my dad to memorialize deputies who had died, in the line of duty or otherwise. Joe said the sheriff told him my father had died as a result of a head injury he'd received in a fight with an unruly man while on a call. The story was new to my mom, but not outside the realm of possibility because my dad didn't always talk about work. He may never have mentioned being knocked to the ground and hitting his head on the concrete. But in early May 1970, he complained of terrible headaches. The last one was so severe, he lost consciousness. He was taken to the hospital and an abscess/aneurism/tumor... something... was removed. The doctor told my mom the operation had been a success, but my dad never woke up. He died in mid-June 1970. Joe told my mom that before he retires, he wants to find out if there is a correlation between the fight and my father's death. He said if so, he wants to get my dad's name added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in D.C., as well as the local memorial on the county courthouse lawn. Joe never knew my dad. He has no compelling reason to do this, other than his own sense of fairness and respect. While I'm knocked out by Joe's exceptional kindness, I'm even more awed that my father - who died before he'd even been deputy sheriff for a year - left that kind of impression on so many people. Even those who didn't know him. I want to be that kind of person.

      Cable television has done it to me again. Specifically the USA Network with a bleeped-out version of "Blow." Why have I not seen  that  movie in all its un-edited Johnny Depp goodness until now? I'd blame the CIA, but this crime bears the signature of Bl0ckbuster. How can I rent every film on my to-see list when they insist on charging me late fees every time I return a movie?

      My mom held one of her world famous garage sales yesterday. You haven't heard of it? Clearly you are out of the loop. She lives in a great location for it, so usually once a summer she opens her 2-1/2 car garage. My aunts and cousins bring their crap over and see if we can unload it. We hang out all day together, make a big lunch and take whatever is left to Goodwill. Good fun. All totalled, we made about $650 this time. My share was $108.95. My mom raked in $135, but $125 was selling a computer; and her cousin took in $188, but $150 of that was a TV. So I emerged the clear winner in the Pure Crap Sales division. The best part is that I no longer have a crap pile in the basement. We're getting ready to paint the house, but I'm having trouble deciding what colors to use. I want something completely different than anyone else in the neighborhood, but can't decide between an Acorn Spice house with Chianti shutters or a Sun Ray house with Caribbean Green shutters. The first combination is really warm and inviting, but the second has a really cool tropical flava. Hmmmm.

This makes you a  golden god . People gravitate to you, and you make them feel good. You are smart, charismatic, and interesting. You may be too sensitive to others reactions, especially criticism. Your self-opinion and mood depends greatly on those around you.  You think fast and have a smart mouth, is a hoot to your friends and razorwire to your enemies. You hold a grudge like a brass ring. You crackle.   Although you have a leader's personality, you often choose not to lead, as leaders stray too far from their audience. You probably weren't very popular in high school--the joke's on them!  You may be a rock star.

      We're staying in Ohio. There are too many variables, jobs being the first. And what if we don't make enough money? The cost of housing down in Florida is more than here and we're already robbing Peter to pay Paul. We're in a debt management program, so it might be smart to get that paid off first. And with the trouble we've had staying current on all our bills, who is going to want to give us a home loan? An apartment is no place for dogs and a teenage boy. What if Scott doesn't make the sailing team? Or the soccer team? Or even fit in? Sandusky is a known entity. We know the schools, the teams, the probability that our kids will do well. We are barely scraping by, but we're managing. And when our debt is paid off, we will have a significant amount of money more than we do right now. Then we can think about moving. It's not a fun choice. It's not the exciting decision. But it feels kind of responsible.

      Looking back, it seems like 2002 was the year to take things apart and examine them. I let things lay in 2003, scattered, in disarray. This year is the one in which I put things back where they belong. I don't regret being a journalist. There are elements of it I will miss -- the people I've met, the stories I've heard, the opportunity to put my words on paper and know that thousands of people are reading them. But it was a world in which I never really fit, no matter how much I enjoyed what I did. This is not a nice way of saying something else. I'm not talking about a specific person or the climate of the newsroom. It's about me having always struggled to  be  a journalist. To think of all the questions that needed to be asked. To remember to follow the money. To be able to ask the questions that were difficult to ask. I've written some great stuff over the past two and a half years. I'm proud of that. But I'm also very glad to be going back where I belong.

      I had a dream last night that I was leaving some sort of event... a festival or concert or something... with a teenage Caroline, when Julio Iglesi@s came up behind me and started kissing on me, trying to pick me up. He was all, "I want to make love to you." and telling me he needed it because his wife and son had just died in a car crash. That one gave me the heebies  and  the jeebies.

      The word of the day on my SBC Yahoo DSL opening screen is untenable: (adjective) impossible to defend. Apropos for today, untenable. There is no longer any sort of defense for what I have let myself become. That photo over there on the right? She's in there somewhere, but the 56 pounds I lost has nearly completely crept right back up on me. I've let it. And I've run out of excuses. Rocky marriage? Not anymore. Work-related stress? Nope. That's gone. Can't afford a YMCA membership? Got a dusty Nordic Track in the basement and miles of sidewalks. Not to mention two fat dogs. Busy? Not  that  busy. It's simple, really. Before, I thought wanted something very badly. More than I ever thought I wanted something in the world. And I thought being slim and beautiful was the answer to getting it. I didn't stand a snowball's chance in hell of getting it because I wasn't beautiful on the inside at the time. But now I'm back to my old self in every way, shape and form... and I really don't like it. I don't like how I look. I'm not comfortable in my skin. But how the hell do I get that motivation back? How do I want the best  me  more than anything in the world?

      When Caroline was a wee girl... about three or so... instead of saying bottom, she would refer to her backside as her "bobbin". Of course, we thought that was the most adorable thing  ever , so we promptly adopted it. As she's matured, bobbin has fallen out of favor and I'm still mourning the loss. However, a few months ago, she coined a new Carolinism. She was in the toilet for a particularly long amount of time, prompting Phil to ask what she was doing. She replied, "Taking a dunk." Dunk. How cute is  that !?

      If you take Murphy's Law and mix it with Newton's Law of Gravity, you have the show for this morning. I had to do it alone because my on-air partner took today (and all next week) off for his Annual Birthday Vacation. Also proving the theory that some things never change, my first solo gig bordered on disastrous. To the average listener, it was probably just sub-par to the normal Monday through Friday fare... but having just crawled from the mangled, hulking train wreck that it was, I know better. And I get to do it again Monday! Wheeee! If you've been wondering where I've been (yeah, I know you haven't... but humor me, mmkay?)... it's soccer camp week. Every August the kids attend a week-long day camp run by Great Britain Buckeye S0ccer. In return for one free camper, we give room and board to one of the coaches for the week. This is the fourth year we've done it and once again we've been having a great week. This year our coach is a cute boy (by boy I mean over 21, but too young for me) from Manchester UK called Kevin, who attends college here in Ohi0. Monday we took him sailing; Tuesday we forced him to watch Finding Nemo; Wednesday he raced sailboats with Phil, Scott, et. al; and last night we took him to Cedar P0int. All the while keeping him well-lubricated with Budweiser. 'Cos we're cool like that. The week has gone by  much  too quickly and I will be sad  to see Kev go. The good news, however, is that his college is less than an hour away, so we'll be able to go down during soccer season and watch him play. Yay! So. Now that I've recovered from the embarassment that was the M0rning Mix, I'm off to record my shift for tomorrow. Cya!
