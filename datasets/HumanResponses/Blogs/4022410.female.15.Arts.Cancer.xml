      k, i was just going to add this on to my last post, but i dont know how...so i am forced to make a new one. anyway, i was just clicking on ppl with my same interests, and there is a huge overlap with the other interests listed...(i.e. one girl had the same book as a favorite as me, the sight; she also had evanescence as a favorite band and LOTR as a favorite movie) its a small thing, but interesting...dammit i sound like a total geek. i guess ive becoming one, what with my toe being dead so for the last few days most have my life has been spent on the computer. i think i can even type faster...  i wish i was at comic con. :(

      having nothing better to do, i'm just going to ramble on here for as long as possible. lets see, today i: *read everyones xangas on my list thing *read collins blog *read imps blog *read jons blog *read  World of Wonders  for a while. quite an excellent book, though u wouldnt think it from the cover. *ate a bagel *read neil gaimans blog *hobbled around for a bit to make sure my toe is really getting better and i really can go to comic con *decided that whether or not it hurts, i'm fucking going to comic con tomorrow. there is no way i'm waiting an entire year *sorted some laundry, then got bored and stopped asteriks are interesting, arent they> sort of like little spiders. i'm listening to the beatles in their drug stage. found out some neat geeky movie stuff; for example, maoyo miyazakis next movie is going to be an adaptation of the diana wynne jones book, Howl's moving castle, so that should be fun. dyj is a very good author, u should all read dark lord of derkholm. also there is talking about making a death movie, which is, of course, beyond cool.  urlLink http://superherohype.com/index.php?id=1774   so...running out of stuff to put...hmmmm...raisins are good. not really much more to say, so now i'll probably just go play day tripper on my guitar and pour over my sandman book for the billionth time. i've memorized practically the entire thing.   course, i'll probably be back on the computer within an hour to type more. what else is there to do>&nbsp; maybe i'll write a story. i haven't done that in a while. what should my story be about>

      I made a blog so i can comment on other ppls without forgetting to leave my name, or for imps, so i can comment on it period. funness. weeeeeeee! maybe i'll even go to comic con today AND tomorrow, even though its already started. laaaaa.&nbsp;titles always sound stupid. i wish i didnt have to post it. the other reason i made it is so i can make jon make me a cool link thing to go on other ppls blogs and ill feel happy and important.
