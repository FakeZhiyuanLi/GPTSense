      ok, so last night i went to the Lance Armstrong concert downtown with Jessee, Sadie, Zsofie, Painter, Amar, Brandon, Jake, and some of their parents...and it was AWESOME!!!! omg i want to marry lance...he is my hero!!  and Steve Miller sang! yea he did!! ABRACADABRA!!!!  but yea, ya'll should deff. wear your LiveStrong bracelets if you have one...b/c they don't just represent lance...they represent all of those who have survived cancer or are going through it right now.  and it shows that dreams do come true...i mean, hello! look at lance!! And dancing in the middle of the streets last night was so cool! everyone was watching us b/c they wish they were us! yea they did! and Brandon and Amar were fighting over me b/c they love me soo much haha..but what could i do? i already have a boyfriend...but i know i always have options.  :) haha ANYWAY, after the Lance thing, we all ate at Whataburger (well, everyone but me) and then we went bowling at like 1 in the morning and i got a strike!! my first ever!!  it was awesome..and then i didn't get home until like 2:30 am...but thats ok, b/c the concert was AWESOME!!!!! omg...this week has been awesome!!  So today,  i went by the school to see if i could talk to my choir teacher b/c she messed up my schedule..but she wasn't there...so i went home and my parents and i went to Highland Mall for Best New Talent auditions, but i didn't actually audition b/c i went last year to California and so we were just wondering if we could skip this year since i was invited back, and come next year.  (we don't know how my mom will be feeling by the time the real auditions in Cali. happen.) so yea, they said yes but they will work with us so i can come this year and they asked me to come to the second audition at the Sheraton Hotel tomorrow and talk to everyone and tell them about my experiences in LA! yea, totally telling them i met AJ Trauth of Even Stevens!!! yea, and then we went shopping at J.Crew and i bought a pair of really cute jeans!! they fit perfectly!! i really love them..and then we went to Barton Creek Mall to shop for some un-mentionables and then home, and now i'm visiting the hotel and writing in my blog! yay! haha but yea, now it is time for me to leave...i have to get ready for tomorrow b/c its my last day of summer! ahh!!!  i'm sooo not ready for school!  If i don't write in my blog tomorrow,  GOOD LUCK ON EVERYONE'S FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!!! or whenever you start!!!  Monica.

      Hey! ok, so yesterday was the best day EVER!!!! ok, so i'll start from the very beginning.....  I woke up early to get ready and go meet Tim and we met up at the mall and then i took him to a cheap place for him to get his hair cut (he looks so good now!) and then we went and saw The Village.  Wow, thats a creepy movie.. and then we went walking around the mall and ran into a friend of mine and her mother and they met him and thought he was very cute (funny, i totally agree with them!) and then he had to leave :(  but then, Jessee invited me to go to Hills Cafe with her and her family and i'm sooo glad i did!!!! ok...here is the second part of my day...  We get to Hills, and Jessee starts flirting with the two guys that work with KVET at the 'free stuff booth' (it was only free because Steve was a genius and lost the spin wheel!) and by the way, Django Walker was singing there last night and if you don't know who he is, Jerry Jeff Walker is his Dad.  and if you don't know who he is then, YOU SUCK!!!! b/c JJW is AWESOME! but yea, i heard that Django went to LIPA University in Liverpool, England, where i am wanting to go so i told the guys at KVET and they pushed me to go talk to him...and i did...and i'm glad i did! so this is the convo with Django: Me: did you go to LIPA Univ.? Django: yea i did M: was it like, an awesome experience? D: omg yes, their vocal teachers are amazing...it was awesome M: ok, cuz i'm looking to apply there D: oh really? what are you going for? M: singing D: oh really? M: yea, i'm a singer D: thats awesome M: yea, is it hard to get in? D: no not at all..as long as you have the pipes, you're in! M: oh, thats great! D: yea, i'll tell you what..email me and i'll tell the guys there to keep a heads up on your audition tape M: omg, thank you! D: yea no problem, enjoy your night M: thanks yea, you too...good luck up there!  OMG YES!!! HE'S WATCHIN OUT FOR ME!!!!  THANK YOU DJANGO!!!!!!!   ok...so instead of watching the concert, me, jessee, her sister, and their foreign exchange student were all hanging out with KVET and got really cool FREE stuff!  and they all call me "Carry Around Portable Monica"...yea...and i un-oficially sing the KVET jingle! "Its the genuine austin original...98.1..KVET!" lol oh and yea...if you are from austin and listen to 96.7 KISS FM, the week after next you have to listen weeknights from 10 pm-5 am and sunday nights from midnight-6am!! b/c Steve-O is the DJ and he'll be filling in for someone for 2 weeks! and he's gonna have me on his show and i'm going to sing live on the radio!! woop! woop! but yea...it was great...KVET IS AWESOME AND THEY ARE MY NEW BEST FRIENDS!!!!!!!!!!! (i'll have pics of Steve and Matt, the 2 guys we were hanging out with, posted soon!)  HAVE A GREAT NIGHT YA'LL!!!

      On Friday i got to go shopping with my boyfriend, Tim, and i helped him pick out all his clothes!  it was so much fun..he even bought a couple of Polo shirts because i like them! (he likes them too...but its more fun acting like he bought them for me, hehe!)  He's a really great guy.  he makes me laugh constantly...But anyway...yea so this past weekend was Tax Free Shopping...yea, totally bought ONE thing!! go figure right? i'm so disappointed in myself.  Oh well, now there are going to be MAJOR sales!! woohoo!! (i'm all about sales) ANYWAY... i don't really have anything else to say.  feel free to comment!  Have a great day!

      hey ya'll today was pretty interesting day..i was woken up around 9 and then fell back asleep and then woken up again around 12:30 by my mom b/c she got a call saying that she needed to go to LoneStar Oncology and have blood drawn for some tests to see if she needs a bone marrow transplant (for those of you who don't know, my mom was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma Cancer stage 4- in December of '03 and has gone through 6 months of heavy doses of chemotherapy...she's in remission now! but is scared to death of the bone marrow treatment...its a life or death situation..and i think she's not going to go through with it) ANYWAY after that she, my sister, and i went to lunch at Schlotzkey's (spell check?) and then to my sister's hair appointment b/c her hair was way too long for her..and the hair stylist was so nice that she even trimmed my mom's wig for her! free of charge! (it had kinda looked like a mullet and needed to be cleaned up) and then we went to the mall and did some shopping then to barnes and nobles and then finally, home.  But yea...that is what has happend so far..oh yea! i'm getting ready to perform in San Antonio (i'm a singer) and i'm really excited! i think that'll be happening at the end of August..ok.  thats all i have to say.  Have a great day ya'll!
