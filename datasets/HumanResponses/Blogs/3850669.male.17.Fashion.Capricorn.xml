      Oops sorry wes for not updating...I know u wanted to see what else is happening in my life. Well its been what..a week since i wrote a blog. (what the heck is a blog anyway) Last week my dad was on off from work, so he decided to take us sightseeing. Whoopie! ....not! i Mean it was fun but not really. I think he enjoyed it so thats all that matters. (We went to see Rockwall ,Fate, Greenville, Royse City, and surounding counties...its a bunch of trees and truck drivers )Ok now that we are updated..i went to Hurricane Harbour with 9 other guys. It was freakin hilarious and mighty fun. It was a thrill to actually meet shamu and keiko (they are indian , dark fat hairy whales). I also proved to myself that i can actually swim in deep deep waters..all thanks to stephans constant peer pressure. I ususally just swim in 4 or 5 feet..afraid to attempt it in deeper ends..but i finally jumped in the 12 ft section. I rode in the new attraction "Tornado"..its actually pretty good. But the best ride of all was standing at the Lagoon and getting soaked by roaring n soaring waters of rampage from a large bucket of chlorinated and urinated water! Following the experience of basically getting urinated by millions of interacial and wet americans , proceeded to Lazy River where we enjoyed a good manly wrestling match down the flowing rivers. It was beautiful ...the ballet and finesse of big brown guys soaring in the air and crashing majestically into the water..ahh the beauty of the ugly n hairy beasts. We sure did catch many eyes of hot girls...not sure if that was in a good sense but at least they noticed our skill in the deep seas. But i now realize that under the influence of drinking and swimming water..never attempt something as stupid as i did..that is to lift the 200+lb Anish aka Biggie aka Poocha aka Shamu ...by the next morning not only did i look into the mirror and see a negro looking back..but i realized im paralyzed from the hair down to my toes (Mainly my upper back)..i have difficulty driving sleeping and other pleasurable things like.......basketball. Hopefully time will tell to see the extent of the damage inflicted on my fragile body. Till then i was victimized to stay home and endure the life of what im use to.....nothing but bordome..back to living single and bored.. However todays climax would be my sisters question to my dad when she was reading a verse from the bible. The verse is from Dueternomy 25:11.  &nbsp;Sister: "Daddy..what is that g word..gen..geni..genitals?"  &nbsp;Dad: "Umm well (stumbles in a quick save but fails) its an organ that supports procreation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Its very important..never hit it..if u hit daddy there i can die"  &nbsp;Sabe:"(laughing histerically but silently)"  &nbsp;Sister:" Oh really?"  &nbsp;Dad:"Yes..Dont hit me in the armpits either.."  ..... yes that was the climax for the night... ahh the joy of that age..such curiousity..u should read that verse which we read today..quite interesting and very informative for u aggresive woman out there. Thats it for tonite..till next time..in a bout a few weeks..i leave u with todays quote/verse..   VERSE OF THE DAY" :"If 2 men fight together, and the wife of one draws near to rescue her husband from the hand of the one attacking him , and puts out her hands and seizes him by the genitals, then you shall cut off her hands; your eye shall not pity her." -Deuteronomy 25:11. (oh man is God so right ...learned from experience?)

       Im supposed to go volunteer at this Hospital (Lakepointe Hospital...home of many old retired vilimbon appachens and ammachis:old white people:) But i figured id take some time off...a week off.. Its not like they need me. There are plenty of other fobs there to help out. Its not total torture. Luckily i have this azn buddy named Tai Mai Shu...jk his name is Huy but he's quite a funny eggroll. So far i got to file papers and put stickers on beds where as he got to push a dead body , check the bloodsugar of patients and give a fat hairy naked guy a shower. Didnt do much today but sleep and eat pizza. I did however go cruising with my dad. Its been a year since ive ridden a bike. I think we pedaled a mile today but it was interesting. I just realized how boring the Dallas metroplex can be. Theres nothing left to do so im suing. I figured id sue George Bush just for the heck of it. My life is very complicated right now. So complicated u will probably stabb urself a few times and then cry and then continue reading because of the suspense. Thus i will allow u to continue to supsenful stabbing till tommorow where i release more of my crazy life. mAUAHAHAH (scary laugh)

      oh yea.....im cool now. Ive jumped on the bandwagon and now have my very own blog. After much peer pressure and ...and. yea....i decided to give this a shot. So far i find it a waste of finger energy and time consumation; but then again i have all the time in the world, so let the time consumation begin. However i realize i dont have much to write down. My blogs wont be as interesting as this guy wes "big pasty" thorn. I gues ill right a more detailed "blog" of my high profile life for u bissys. Oh yes there maybe some langauge barrier and confusion. The lingo maybe confusing between the citizens and immigrants but dont worry ill try my best to make it even more puzzling. Till then just go and be proud u havent been threatened by a 3 ton poocha.
