      Ooops, over already.  Hope everyone's went well. Painted, painted, painted (see  Games Workshop's Warhammer page  for what i'm painting.  Went to a  Warhammer Conflict in Toronto  and learned to play Warhammer 40k (well played a game anyway), made a pile o' rocks from styrofoam and wood chips (when in doubt of what scenery to make, make a hill or pile o' rocks) and looked over a couple of VERY cooly painted armies. (see above, painted, but not as nice as these guys :(  )  Oh and slept once in a while too.

      Another day another 50 cents.  Been a few days since my last post (Being the long weekend and all)  Went to see Troy (great movie, violence, gore AND a story).  Why, oh why, didn't they burn the bloody horse?  Calgary's in the lead for the Stanley Cup play-offs :) Woot! Not an exciting game, but good that they won.

      Just visiting some of the blogs i check out on occasion and saw in Oats' blog a "stalking" list.  Thought it was a great idea... so i "borrowed" it.  There's now a "Places to sit and think" list to the left of the posts.  I'll put some more on there soon.  Promise.  Gotta work again.

      Almost finished a post and "whoomp" power goes out at work.  Fortunately our servers are on battery backup so they didn't go down.  Unfortunately, nothing else in our office is.  Drat. What did i lose this time around?  Post about Scotland coming up soon...

      In case you haven't noticed a theme going on in the pictures i pick to the left, I like Scotland.  I'd love to live there (in the highlands or on Iona).  I spent a week there on a tour with Cosmos Tours and absolutely loved it.  Feel free to take a look around my   photo gallery.   I only took 7 films worth of pictures :)

      Love the picture on the side bar, hate the day... not only is this my long day, the server at work is  FUBAR .  It's finally running again, but i don't seem to have the patience for this after sleeping only 2 hours the night before.  Ah well.  Life could be worse.

      Contrary to the exciting title, this weekend was a dull and un-inspiring thing. Hope y'all had a better one than i did.  Got up, cleaned, played games, slept.  Missed the tournament i was hoping to watch (warhammer rogue trader), didn't get to see any of the movies i wanted to see (Van Helsing or Troy), painted a bit of my warhammer models (i should put a picture up some day) and had a staff meeting (somebody please shoot me, being the only guy in a room full of insane females is not fun)  Oh and now that the weekend is over.... back to work.

      I spend a lot of time reading online comics.  My favorite of all time is MegaTokyo.  It's a great, in depth story with a wide variety of characters (yay Miho!) so you can find the one who is most like you (apparently Piro according to those "Who are you" tests).   There's great humour (Largo's apparent indistructibility, but continued bad luck springs to mind immediately), some romance (okay Piro ask her out already) and oh, did i mention the story.  Great writing on the part of Fred "Piro" Gallagher.  Wish i could actually get to one of the cons so i could meet this guy.  Visit the comic  urlLink MegaTokyo - relax, we understand j00   I recommend it (if ya hadn't noticed)

      /me sneaks into Nyx' realm of music review (see the Places to Sit And Think to the left)  Can anyone tell me the group that sings "The Death Of All The Romance".  I want to mock them properly.  I think i am in need of some more blood as the horrific sounds that came out of my speakers have seemed to caused my ears to spontaneously explode.  Wow, it starts so nice.  Then they sing.  /me sneaks back out of Nyx' realm.  P.S.  Fer all ye non-gaming type people "/me" means emote.  It'd show up as "DarkWolf sneaks back out of Nyx' realm" on other player's screens [:]

      Okay, maybe not happier.  Ever checked out  urlLink The Onion ?  Who ever thought killing yourself would end up being a Simpson's quote.  Check out the  "wierd news" article  on a suicide full note of Simpson's quotes.  I wanna go out like that... well i'd like to live to a ripe old age, but this would be amuzing as well.

      Oh, the pain.  Wow, i didn't know i had muscles there.  Started working out last night.  Curled up into a ball this morning.  Whoever though of the treadmill was sadistic.  That place is like a room full of midieval torture devices.  *whimper*

      Wow.  MSN blows us away again.  Check out the  urlLink MSN Dating & Personals - Top 10 summer love songs .    What an amazingly horrible list of songs!  "Summer Lovin'" Maybe. "Summertime" by Will Smith .... maybe... but ugh...  One of the people on fark.com described it as: "Top 10 Songs from a List We Hastily Passed Around the Office Ten Minutes Before Everyone Went to Lunch (It's Sloppy Joe Day)"  Accurate?  Yeah.

      Found a few fun sites in the last few days. I've been aimlessly wandering the internet and found new comics, games and a few new newsletters to sign up for.  I've started to add more of the comics to the left, hopefully i'll get more blogs in there soon too!

       Warhammer Hordes of Chaos Post :)   Well i found out on monday why people hate fighting Chaos in Warhammer.  I played one of the  Storm of Chaos  events at my local gaming store and after worrying about the Bretonnian charge, which promptly wiped out a vast quantity of my army.  My Chaos Knights joined in the fray and fear overwelmed the enemies as they ran before my advance.  When they did hit my knights, they kinda.... bounced off.  My nasty hell cannon made all his archers run off the board, but then ate it's crew.... went very slowly and couldn't get anywhere.  My first victory!!! Mwahahahaha!  It came down to the scenario victory points and i won.     Anywho, back to work, no more play...

      Whoops!  Hello again after an extended delay.  I had that odd feeling that i hadn't done everything i was supposed to do.  Mainly update the blog :(  I've added a link to Nyx's music blog on the left.  Good reviews of great music choice.  Just got back from visiting my sister in Ottawa for Canada Day.  Wish we had fireworks like those here in Barrie! Wow!    We also went to Montreal.  Guess we should have checked out what was going on, most of old Montreal was shut down due to a music festival and we ended up driving around the city for 3 hours.  Got to see St. Joseph's Oratory (hope that's the right name) up on the mountain, some of old Montreal and the outside of Notre Dame Basillica.  It closes at 4:30 in the summer for some sound & light show.  Drat, was hoping to get in there. Oh well.  A great trip all around.  Thanks Sis!
