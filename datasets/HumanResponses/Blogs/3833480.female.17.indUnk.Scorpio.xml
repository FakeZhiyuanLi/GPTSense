      So my bf and I talked to that girl we were thinking about adding...yeah...  When we first started talking about all this I was really flip floppy. Yes we should ask her, no wait I'm not sure, ok let's go for it, no no I'm scared. Then she figured out that we were thinking about asking her out (which is kinda creepy), and it was her turn to decide.  I thought her answer was prolly gonna be no. Mainly cuz she's with another guy but I thought we still had a chance. I was right at first and kind of right currently...I think.  So yeah, at first she said no cuz she's with her man. Understandable. We told her it's not a now or never thing. But then the next day she changed her mind. She came over to my house so a youth group meeting and afterwards we went to the mall. Sometime during the meeting she decided she wanted to be with us. We talked about it some while we were shopping and she said she was gonna dump her bf that night. Cameron was more flirty with her than normal the rest of the night and that was fine. So then we were all at home and we thought we should call her and make sure she knew some of the rules that would be in place before she actually broke up with her boy. A little while after we got off the phone she called me back to tell me she had changed her mind again. "I just can't see myself having sex with you," was her reason.  All day at work today I kept thinking about all this. I thought maybe she's just scared or maybe she just wanted Cameron and didn't realize it. I don't know. I got yelled at by my boss though. I was so out of it. For the first half of my shift I couldn't stay out of my head.  Then I started thinking about what I want. I don't know what the fuck I want. I want to try polyamory and I want to try it with the girl we asked. I also kinda want my Cameron all to myself forever and ever. I think I want to try the first one more though. I want the three of us to be happy, together or apart.  It's weird, before all this I'd never thought of her in a sexual way. I never thought of dating her. I wasn't and I'm still not in love with her. I don't know though...maybe someday I could be. I think there's a good chance I could be. Wow, that's scary. I've never dated someone I didn't already love, or at least I thought I loved them. I always want to be sure about things. I know I can't be sure all the time and that I have to take chances. Like I said I've never thought about her in a sexual way before. I don't think I'd be comfortable going over and having sex with her right now but I think it could happen later. How much later I don't know. This is all so weird...by that I just mean different and that makes me unsure and scared.  She says she looks up to us too much to be able to think about having sex with us. I don't know if I really understand that. I admire her too. I'm pretty sure Cammy does also. I care about her a lot and I want to try and make it work. I'm fuckin scared but I'll try. *deep breath* Maybe she'll change her mind again. Maybe she won't. Maybe she's not ready now and she never will be or maybe it's not meant to be at all. Jeez I don't know but if she doesn change her mind we're ready.

      Know what I hate??? When I have  no  control over a certain aspect of my life.   I HATE IT!!!     Ok, I realize that there are going to be things that happen in my life that are completely out of my control. I'm ok with that, I accept that. I guess what I should be saying is I hate it when someone else completely controls an aspect of my life. Especially when they don't even really know me. There are almost always choices I can make. Even when things I can't control happen I can take responsibility for the choices I make before and after the situation. Not with this.    My grandpa in Kentucky has complete control of my college money because I'm only 17. For one thing he lives in freakin' Kentucky and has no clue what my life is like or what kind of person that I am. All he knows is that I'm 17, tested out of high school, have maintained a 3.5 gpa in college and I've held a job for over a year. I'm responsible and trustworthy and those things should be obvious to him. I can't be going drugs or anything like that along with full time school and work. For some reason though, he's a jerk every time I ask him for MY money. Right now I'm at a community college and the past two semesters I've taken between 12 and 9 units. This semester I'm taking 14. When i talked to him in July about how much I'd need for school I guessed based on what I needed before. It turned out I was off by about $200. I tried to explain to him that when I first added everything up I didn't have my booklist so I couldn't have known. He replied with "Bull, you're in college. You can add." Then he told me I had to send him a list of all the expenses I added up and he would check my math and then decide. It wouldn't have bugged me so much if he wasn't so mean about it. He actually acused me of asking for more money so I could give it to my dad! How dare he judge me like that! My education is very, very important to me, I wouldn't give my school money away! If he had just asked to see my list of expenses and hadn't made so many acusations and judgements it would've been fine.    Gawd!! he makes me so angry!     On the bright side, I got the job I wanted. I work on campus now and have set hours. I get 20 hours a week. I'm leaving Jamba on August 9th and I start my new job on Tuesday. I'm so happy. That's gonna take a lot of stress away. My boss seems really cool too. And all my friends can come in and bug me. it's gonna be great.     *Deep breath* Ok, I feel a lot better now.

      Lately my boyfriend and I have been talking about one person in our lives a lot...It's causing some strange feelings.   My man and I are polyamorous. At least we're experimenting with it. I've been having a really hard time getting used to the thought of him loving someone else and still loving me just as much as ever. I'm so jealous and possessive by nature just the thought of him with another person freaks me out. Lately though, we've been talking about maybe asking someone we know to join us. The crazy thing is, I think it's a good idea.   I really hadn't thought of this person in a romantic way before. It was Cameron who brought it up, I think. Maybe it wasn't really brought up so much as it came up. We've noticed that when hanging out with this person there aren't any feelings of jealousy. Things that would usually really piss me off, I don't even think twice about. It's really strange to me because I've never had this happen before.   We really started talking about all this and it makes sense. This girl and I are a lot alike and we've been friends for quite a while. I think we could give each other a lot of moral support and all that. It's just so weird how it snuck up on us.   I'm really glad all this is happening. I think I was scared before because I thought that my boyfriend would want to add someone hot, someone fun to have sex with. Now I know that's not it at all. This is the perfect way for us to start our poly relationships. We both think it's a good idea and it just feels so natural. Even if we never pursue this relationship I'm really glad we talked about or feelings because now I know how this is all supposed to feel.

      Man, work sucks so hard. It stresses me out so much. My manager is realllllly stupid and a big bitch. I'm supposed to be in training for managment but all I've done in the past 3 weeks or so is learn how to do things I already know how to do. My manager keeps saying we'll do more but we never do. School starts up again in August and I've got a 14 unit load. I think I really screwed myself there. I'm thinking about quitting my job when school starts but the thought of not having an income scares the crap out of me. I'm still living at home so rent isn't an issue for now but I have to buy all my own clothes, school stuff, deodorant and all that with my own money. Both of my parents are so broke. I need to go to the financial aid office and fill out all the paperwork. I should do that Tuesday cuz I have the day off. If I can get financial aid I won't be so stressed. I hate being stressed, especially now cuz I'm sick. I know things will get better though, they always do.

      I just got some wonderful news. Well, it's wonderful for me but really crappy for someone else. I really, really, REALLY don't like my step mom. She's so freakin' mean to my sister and I. A couple months ago my dad had to file bankruptcy and now he has to sell his house. His plan was to sell it to my step mom because they are legally divorced due to previous drama. I was so worried that she was gonna kick my dad out and try to take the house for herself since it would be in her name. I'd been praying and do energy work for it to fall through. I was also hoping that if they couldn't keep the house they'd split up, forever this time. It happened! My dad had to sell his house to a stranger and he and my step mom are renting separate houses in different towns. I'm sooooo happy, I can't wait for him to move out. I feel kind of bad because I know it's hurting my dad to break up with her. Everyone knows it's for the best though. I'm so excited, my daddy is gonna be happy again!

      Ok....*deep breath* assuming nothing else crazy happens with her I think I'm ready to try. I wanna wait until school starts and make sure I'm not gonna be all stressed or anything. I basically wanna get settled in my new schedule before I make any more changes in my life. I really think I'm ready to try, finally. I don't think I'll be jealous or afraid or anything. I know it's gonna take work but I'm ok with that. I'm ready for that. Man, if she does anything else stupid and hurts us again I'm gonna fucking kill her. Not really :). I expect some frustration and pain, that's part of being in a relationship but anything outside the normal relationship issues won't be tolerated.

      This sucks, now the choice is mine. I hate choices that affect more than one other person but less than like 10 people. It's crap.  I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do. I've been saying fuck a lot more than usual lately. I can't tell if I put up a wall or if I made my feelings go away. I want it to work but I don't know if it can. Why couldn't she have been sure when I was???? Damn people making up their minds on their own time. Damn fear and pain and trust issues. I'm not scared, finally, but I am/was hurt and I have trust issues.  Fear is a crazy thing. I know it's pretty much essential to survival of a species but it also clouds rational thought and impares the ability to love and sometimes live. Damn the universe for creating such a complicated emotion. Why couldn't people just have instinct like other animals? Then we would know what to avoid but also what to love and there wouldn't be all the insecurities. I guess it comes with intelligence. We analyze everything too much and confuse ourselves. I dunno, I think animals are better off sometimes. Screw using tools and haveing stuff. All they do is eat and be lazy and have sex. Plus, they don't have to give a fuck about all the emotions and shit we have. Well, they have emotions but they seem to deal with it better. If they don't like something they kill it. Easy enough :).  Wow, I'm just letting my mind run away right now I guess.  I love my Cameron so much. He keeps me sane. I miss him already. I left his house about 20 mins. ago. I really don't know what I'd do without him...I imagine I'd move on but I'm pretty sure I'd always have a gaping hole in my heart. I really , really  want to be with him forever.     My new job is going well. It's kinda boring when there's no one to ring up but the people I work with are nice and fun to talk to. There are lots of interesting people I meet too. I like meeting random people. I'm normally shy but at work I have an excuse to talk to them so I take advantage of that.  I wonder if this whole thing will work out like I want it to. I hope so. I wonder if I'm still partially broken. I can be happy so I'm not really broken but I haven't cared as much about things. Maybe I'm just growing up and not being as easily annoyed or frustrated? Shit I don't know. Whatever, it's gotta get better sooner or later. Watch though, I'm gonna make up my fucking mind and say that it's not gonna happen and she's gonna go back to Bryan or get in some other relationship and my hearts gonna be all...oh wait, you do love her, my bad. That would suck. Maybe I should just try and see what happens? No that's stupid. I'll just have to wait.  I finally got my check from my asshole grandpa. The bank wouldn't cash it though. Damn bank. I don't like very many things today. I don't know what to do about that. There's nothing I can do really. Margee is gonna try to help me. Hopefully she can. I want my books and I don't want to have to wait  forever  to get them. Oh well, I should let that go since there's really nothing I can do.  I'm excited about school starting. Yay school! Archeology and corsets and psyc and English with Christian! Hooray! In a week i'm gonna be like, "I fucking HATE SCHOOL. AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!" Maybe more than a week, hopefully never but prolly eventually. I'm taking 14 units cuz I'm crazy.  This feels like a long post. I wonder if anyone will read it all. Prolly Margee cuz I think she's the only one that reads this thing anyway. Hi Margee. Maybe I should just start writing to her. Haha, that'd be weird. I think I'll stick to writing about her :).

      On a good day I'm patient, level headed and try my hardest to be fair. On a bad day I'm jealous, possesive, irrational and vengeful. Today I'm leaning towards the bad.  I got a response from my grandpa last nice, fucking asshole. He's sending me less money than I need for one thing. The other part of the email was crazy. He basically told me that if I don't stop practicing Paganism he won't send me any more of MY school money. I was so pissed off. He said I was waving my beliefs in his face and that's just ridiculous. He's such an ass. So now I might have to take him to court and get soemone else to be in charge of my money.  Another thing that's bothering me is the whole situation with the girl we wanted to date. I don't think she has feelings for us. Romantic feelings I mean. Or if she does she hasn't shown us that. Cameron is pretty emotionally invested in this whole thing and I don't want him to get hurt. She's apperently interested in someone else now and that's kind of annoying. I wanna know how long he's been in the picture and if it's been a while why the hell didn't we know about him. I was under the impression it was either us or Bryan but now there's this guy. It's also crappy if he's new cuz he's making her rethink being with us. if some yummy guy can come in a make her change her mind we must not be that special. So right now I'm ready to say fuck it and just be friends. I was emotionally invested in this working out but then I thought she was really gonna stay with Bryan so I think I put up a wall. I can't really care anymore. I want to but I don't. I still wanted to try cuz I'm sure I could break down the wall if I knew she really wanted to be with us. I think all this just might add drama though. Cameron and I have been doing so well lately, I've been so happy and we've been working through things so well. I feel protective and selfish right now. This new guy changes things and I don't think I wanna deal with it. I think she should just go for the new guy if she wants him.  I don't know though. I'm really pissed off right now and I'm prolly being irrational. All I really care about right now is my baby. I'm going camping for the weekend and I love being in the forest. I'll be able to think clearly there and there won't be people who will influence my decision. When I come back we'll all have to talk and really resolve this. I'm deffinately not ready to do anything right now.

      I took a test to find out if I'm a sex goddess and it said I was a tantilizing temptress and that I never go after what i want but I should cuz I rock. Or something along those lines :). I think this is funny cuz I normally don't go after anyone I want unless I'm pretty sure they want me. Today thought, I actually flirted with this beautiful guy that came into my work. Gawd he was hot, and I actually talked to him! Everyone be proud, I am and I know Cameron will be too. He's going to my school this semester so hopefully I'll see him on campus and talk to him agian :).  Today was really good after about 10:30 in the morning. Cammy and I stayed the night at Margee's and getting home by bus this morning was frustrating. Once we got home though...mmm...it was nice. I took a shower and that made me feet better. then Cameron and I played with our new handcuffs and it was amazing. I don't know if I just forget how good he is all the time or it keeps getting better. It doesn't really matter cuz it's always great. So yeah, that made me really happy for the rest of the day.  I had my second day at my new job today and that went well too. Yesterday was crazy and stressful and my trainer was bitchy and crappy at training. Today though, I figured everything out and did really well. The people I worked with today were really nice too so that helped. I'm looking forward to working there tomorrow.  My life is going pretty well. I'm so in love with Cameron and he makes me so happy. School starts soon and I'm really excited. As soon as I get my money for school my stress will pretty much be gone. All except for the normal stress that no one can make go away, that I can deal with. I'm so happy. I can just relax for a while and learn and love my baby :). Yay.

      A friend of mine told me that I'm the only one who makes true love real because I believe so fully in it. That along with a few other events and decisions sparked this.  I believe that love is the most important thing in my life. I believe in true, beautiful, unconditional love. I am in love, really truly in love with my Cameron and I really feel we can share our love with other people as well. I think if you're in relationship with someone and you realize you don't love them anymore or that you never really did you should leave that relationship because there's something better out there for both of you. If there is no potential for love in a relationship why commit yourself to that person?  Because of my current situation I've been thinking a lot about love. I realize I need it, even live for it but it scares the crap out of me. I have a hard time trusting people and I'm so afraid I'll get hurt. But lately I've been noticing how much fear causes clouded emotions and it made me wonder if I'll recognize the right situations if I'm always so scared. I've decided I don't have to be sure about everything, I don't have to know everything all the time. If I do get hurt I learned something and I can move on and know something else will come. I know love scares everyone and that's ok but I feel I might unitentionally avoid good siuations out of fear. I don't want that at all. So now I'm gonna do my best to just trust my heart and not worry so damn much. Everything will be ok in the end.

      This whole thing with the other girl is affecting me way more that I thought it would. I don't know how to handle it. For the most part I've just been doing nothing and trying to go about my life like always. It keeps getting harder though. A decision was made but not really. There's still so much emotion and confusion surrounding it that it's hard to just accept it and move on. I want to talk to her about it but I don't want to push it. I have questions I would love to have answered but I'm not sure there'd be answers even if I asked. I feel like maybe if we discuss it we might all be able to help in reaching a conclusion, or at least an understanding of what's going on. At the same time though, I feel like it's kinda her decision to make and I don't want to further confuse her. I don't know what the fuck to do. I honestly had no idea it'd be this hard on me.  After she decided she wanted to be with us then didn't because she couldn't feel the sex I've felt broken. By broken I mean my emotions are broken. I can hardly feel anything. This hardly ever happens to me but when it does it's suffocating. It's very hard for me to be happy or enjoy tiny things I notice daily but it's also hard to be sad or hurt or anything like that. All I can really be is angry or irritable. I would say I hate feeling like this but I don't have the emotion to hate right now. It makes it so hard for me to think about what I want because I don't know what makes me happy. I kind of know and it gets better and worse at times but for the most part I'm pretty apathetic. I ache though. It's so hard to explain...that's why I just say I'm broken. I'm not entirely sure what it's from, I never imagined I had invested enough emotional energy into wanting this girl for her choice to cause this. I don't do things like that. How could I have put so much into something so unpredictable? When I get like this it's usually better in a few days, I hope that's the case this time.  Another thing I didn't expect from all this is how I feel when I'm around her and her bf. I feel sad and I guess jealous is the best word. Not an angry jealous but an unfairness I guess. I hate it. She and I have a had a great friendship and if it gets ruined...no, I won't let it...at least I'll try my hardest. It won't get ruined, no matter what she decides when she sorts out all her feelings she'll still be my friend. Maybe my best friend.  I don't understand what's going on with me. How could I not have known how all this would affect me? I knew the idea of her joining us felt so right, so natural but I didn't know how invested I was in it working. It's crazy to me that all this snuck up on me, I thought I knew myself better. I thought I was more in control of my feeling but apparently I'm not. I guess it's ok, scary because I'd like to be prepared for things like this but ok because I can't be prepared for everything. That would be boring. Jeez, this girl sure has brought about a lot of firsts, there are probably still more to come (I really hope there are). I wish she knew what a wonderful person she is. I think she has some idea but she doesn't give herself enough credit. Yeah, I can definitely see myself falling for her....
