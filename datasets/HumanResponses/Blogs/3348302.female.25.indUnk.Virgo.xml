      When I was 17 one of my closest girlfriends, Laura, started escorting. She got her start through an agency a mutual friend of ours worked the phones for. What one does when they have an expensive habit... She slept with strange men to support hers, I just dated the dealers and worked odd jobs for mine.  Laura was pretty miserable in what she was doing, which in my opinion is still pretty understandable - especially for someone of our age. I still think it's strange how she felt bad about herself and her life, so she became a huge coke-head, which in order to continue with this escapasim she had to start prostituting herself which in turn made her feel worse and made her even more dependant on her habit. Cycles, cycles, cycles... But at least she got hooked up through an agency. During this period so many people we knew, both girls and guys alike, who were fresh in the land of the addict but were younger simply took to the streets to earn their keep. This was also when crystal meth was first coming on strong in the scene - it was new and people took to it like nothing else, pills seemed for a brief while to be a thing of the past now that crystal had come along and was such a huge focus. Crystal was my poison of choice. But Laura had other tastes of preference.  Most of her calls were horror stories that she would tell me while trying to numb it away. But after awhile she got a few regulars who were actually alright and treated her fairly well. One of these regulars was a wealthy man named Paul. Now Paul didn't want to fuck Laura, which made him instantly one of her favourites, Paul wanted Laura to come over to do his make-up and dress him up in fancy women's clothes. Paul also had very expensive habits.  So one day Paul called for Laura's services and she asked if he minded if she brought a friend along to chill out. Upon determining that essentially he would have the fun of two girls dressing him up and having girl talk for the price of one, he got super excited and said that she had to bring me. His apartment in Yorkville was gorgeous, especially to a poor, drug addicted girl like me. He looked completely normal, a well-polished clean cut business man. Apparently Paul's power position in his company made him want to be as femme as possible when he came home.  After welcoming us, he brought us into the living room where he fixed us each a vodka-cran and opened a wooden box beside the coffee table. He pulled out a  huge  bag of coke and dropped it on the table and we all went to town. He paid for an hour that night but we stayed for about eight hours getting high and drunk and playing dress-up. When he was all done up his favourite thing would be to prance around the apartment talking in a feminine voice about silly girly things while we called him 'Miss Elizabeth'.  "Oh Miss Elizabeth - wherever do you get your hair done?","Miss Elizabeth that dress looks absolutely divine on you. Just look at the way it hugs your ass", "Miss Elizabeth....", "Oh Miss Elizabeth you look so pretty".  One of our favourite rituals with him was filling the condoms or balloons with water which he then used as his temporary breasts. The water gave them the perfect jiggle so he said. Too much fun, good ol' Paul was.  This became a regular event for Laura and I over a period of several months. Paul stopped booking sessions and would just have us over together several times a week. He gave us money for whatever and gave us lots of free drugs. And all we had to do was hang out, do his make-up and indulge in his fantasies of being a woman.  Then came the time when everything started unravelling and all was just a good memory. Laura had a really bad call and took a moment to re-evaluate things, which led to her going and taking a nice time-out in the land of rehab. 'Miss Elizabeth' met her 'Mr. Right' who accepted her in all her femme glory and so Paul became a permanent 'she' and moved to the states. Me? I went back to dating dealers and scrounging money where I could to support my addictions which I would not be ready to deal with for many moons to come.

      1993: It was early in the first semester of Grade 9, how old are you then – 13 maybe? Anyways, I had just started high school right outside of Barrie. Compared to the public school which was small and in a community where everyone knew everyone else – going to this high school which housed over 3000 students from all the surrounding areas. I was meeting new people left, right and center… and loving every minute of it.  One day this girl I had only just met,Genevieve, and I found ourselves outside smoking right after the last class before lunch. We had had mutual friends but hadn’t really talked. She asked me if I wanted to go smoke some hash under the bridge. I had never done anything besides drink before and I’ve always been a very curious person who has trouble turning down new things that could be potentially exciting. I said sure.  We walked down to the little bridge and decsended along the worn dirt path to climb up underneath it. I had never been there before but everyone always talked about going there, this was “the” place kids smoked drugs at during school hours. There were stones placed perfectly in little circles to seat yourself on. Lighters, empty beer bottles, cigarette butts… the place was strewn with garbage. For somewhere which was spoken of so sacredly it was not taken care of very well.  She pulled out a plastic pop bottle she had been carrying and began the ritual. I had never even witnessed the act of preparing bottle tokes “bt’s”. I was silent as she broke out eight little pieces of the smelly brown/black chunk. I was told that four “bots” was sufficient enough to get us nicely cooked. So we did then, and I didn’t really feel anything other than a little light-headed. She got quiet, staring at that chunk of hash finally saying, “Fuck it. I stole this from my brother, he’s going to notice some is gone and bitch me out for it so I might as well not put any of it back. We should just smoke it all right now.” Once again, all I could say was “sure”.  We spent the entire lunch break smoking hash under that bridge and ended up doing close to 20 bots each by the time we were done. Even now, after so much experimentation and tolerances that have been built up, I couldn’t smoke that much and hope to be coherent in even the smallest of ways. So not knowing what the hell was going on, we left and went back to school to start our afternoon classes.  I didn’t know what I was feeling, what I was thinking, what was going on… I knew absolutely nothing except that I had never felt that way before, I had never felt so out of my mind, out of my body, disoriented and confused. Sitting at my desk a boy I had the biggest crush on asked in a condescending tone if I had ‘smoke dope’ which he was violently against. I lied, not an oscar worthy performance, and told him no. Then I got up declared loudly that I was extremely ill and walked out. Everything else is a haze – running  into people in the hallways, stumbling and trying to hold myself up, calling my parents to come pick me up because I was sick. Which they did. Which I don’t remember. My mom thought it was the flu, I had apparently passed out in the back of the car and had to be escorted to bed.  This was my first time ever experimenting with drugs of any kind. It was certainly not the last. This one is for Genevieve who was my initial benefactor.  2004: I had been at club with banging techno all night. Several friends and I went to this after party at some loft space and kept on going. We were in real troublmaking moods that night and the amount of shit that we ingested was disgusting. Around 7am I was sitting on a couch bent over one of the coffee tables in the main living area breaking out lines of coke. Someone sits on the floor in front of the table across from me and begins doing the same. I looked at her and some something familiar, but didn’t really think about it and just attributed any feelings of strangeness I was having to the severe abuse. We started small talk and then her eyes got all big and she started having quite the shit fit asking if my name was &^*#@. This girl was Genevieve. Just over 10 years earlier she had gotten me high for the very first time,  and now we, as strangers sitting across from another met while sharing lines of coke. I think some cosmic force was seriously fucking with me that night. And if it wasn’t strange enough that we met again there, it turned out for a year she had been living a five minute walk from me with a friend (who was my best friends roomates best friend) who’s house I had been to partying several times.   (Strange things happen if we only take a moment to notice)

      It was in August of 1997 if I remember correctly, but I could be off a year. I had sprained both of my ankles pretty badly a few weekends before and was limping around everywhere, but still adamant about going out and partying.  &nbsp;  A few of us had gone to this jungle party at the Opera House, it was smaller but actually turned out to be a really good time. It was Caribana weekend, and this Caribana had brought with it much conflict – it seemed more than past years from what I could recall. There were rumors that a girl we knew had been grabbed, beaten and raped in a dark corner of Nathan Phillips Square by several tourists visiting for the occasion. This was also the year in which the shootings had taken place outside of Sam the Record Man and a couple of blocks north at The Big Slice, both on Yonge Street. I remember walking by and seeing the blood on the sidewalk and little chalk circles drawn by the police to show where bullets or casings had landed. This weekend makes me nervous every year – too many people who seemingly are trying to prove who is tougher. Is it the people from the States? Or Toronto residents getting defensive? Who knows. I would just normally try to avoid the downtown core when I could during this time.  &nbsp;  My friends Laura, Ros, Maur, Shaun and I left the Opera House and were still too messed up and impatient waiting for a streetcar to take us back down Queen so we began to walk. They were teasing me about my limping from my sprained ankles and how I was going to come across all thugged out to any passers by which would cause alarm due to the fact that it was Caribana. The sun had come up hours before and no transit was in sight. We were tired, high, blinded by the brightness and just wanting to get to the next party.  &nbsp;  Slowly we were making our way up Yonge Street, it was about 11am at this point and we were almost past the Eaton Centre. This guy suddenly comes out of a doorway, he was all thugged out and I’d say probably no more than 19 or 20. He said, “Psst. Yo man, come here for a minute” to my friend Shaun. Shaun paused, when he shouldn’t have and the guy cornered him in the doorway. He had pulled out a knife and was waving it around telling Shaun to hand over his wallet, jewelry, and any drugs we may have. I was frozen. I couldn’t believe this was happening at 11am with the sun beating down and in front of the Eaton Centre where people were going in and out about to start their shopping days.  &nbsp;  No words were spoken by any of us. The silence that hung in the air was so thick I felt like it was burrowing down my throat and choking me. Shaun looked at me with no expression on his face and I remember thinking how strange that was. I couldn’t read fear, anger… nothing. He looked at this little thug waving the knife around, sighed and shaking his head said, “Man, not today. Any other day but just not today” almost like it was an inconvenience that he just didn’t have the mental capabilities to deal with at this moment in time. He calmly moved past the guy, still holding the knife and looking so fucking confused, and continued walking up Yonge.  &nbsp;  I couldn’t believe what had just happened. Shaun was not even phased at all. The rest of us were caught somewhere between complete relief and shock. It could have been a bad situation. It could have been the third spot within a five-block radius where blood was shed that weekend. But apparently it just wasn’t a good time for Shaun to be robbed or stabbed. Some things you just can’t make sense out of, and sometimes you should just stop trying and accept it as it was not as it could have been.

      I used to frequent this little club quite often when I was around 20, and was pretty well acquainted with the owner. On certain nights they would have guest dj’s in to spin house or jungle, on others the focus would be more on the mod scene playing a lot of retro and 80’s music.  &nbsp;  On one particular night my friend Laura and I were banging back shots of tequila with one of our favourite bartenders, Mike. Across the dancefloor I noticed this guy staring at me and smiling. He had drinks ordered and brought over by one of the servers to Laura and I. He had really short neatly cut light hair, a more pale complexion, piercing blue eyes and very defined facial features – almost Roman. I recognized him as a regular there and knew that we had some mutual friends.&nbsp; I asked Mike about him and he said that he didn’t know the guy that well but he seemed cool, albeit kind of arrogant, and tipped really well.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  He eventually walked over and offered to buy our next round of shots if he could join in. Never one to turn down free alcohol we accepted with no hesitation. He introduced himself as ‘Will’ and asked our names. When I told him mine he took my hand in his and doing a mock bow kissed it. It wasn’t done in an awful cheezy way, and kind of made me blush especially since he wouldn’t stop staring really intensely into my eyes. We had a few more drinks with him and then left stumbling home.  &nbsp;  A couple of nights later we were back at the club with our bartender when Will showed up. More drinks on him that we didn’t refuse. This time we were able to talk a bit more and although he had this intensity and seriousness about him, I came to find that he had the most sarcastic and great sense of humor. I admit that after this second meeting I was pretty taken with him. When leaving we exchanged numbers with his promise to call the next day to make a plan to hook up sometime within the week.  &nbsp;  He called on queue and we met up for drinks at a pub. His voice was so smooth and I found myself thinking more and more how this is someone I could possibly pursue a relationship with. While talking I could see hints of tattoos under the sleeve of his shirt and asked him to show them to me, but he declined and said he would in time. I didn’t think much of it at that point except that maybe he was a bit bashful.  &nbsp;  So we began to chill together almost every day, it was a romantic and sweet courtship. He showered me with kindness, compliments and gifts like no one else had in quite some time. One night while we were at the club again a mutual friend came up and pulled me aside asking me what was going on with us. I advised them that we had just been hanging out, kind of seeing each other. He asked how far it had gone; I started to get defensive and told him that it was none of his business and that he didn’t know me well enough to ask me these kinds of questions. He chuckled and said fine, but before walking away told me to simply be careful and watch myself, that he wasn’t what he seemed. I attributed this behavior to nothing more than jealousy.  &nbsp;  A few weeks went by and he finally took me back to his place to hang out after our night of drinking. On his couch kissing he pulled back and spoke the most flattering words that have ever been spoken to me, poetry from his sweet lips. He said that he felt himself falling for me and saw me as someone he could potentially be with for a really long time. Then he said that there was one thing he needed to discuss with me. He told me one of the things that initially attracted him to me was that I was ‘purebred’. He said that he had been watching me for some time before finally approaching me and could tell that even beyond my looks that I was ‘pure’. I started to inch away from him on the couch concerned and not understanding where this was going exactly. He said that we could have beautiful and perfect children together down the road. All these random things he kept telling me, but never getting to a point and I was started to get scared and uncomfortable. He went on running his fingers through my hair saying that it was the perfect gold, how my skin was pale and the perfect peach/white, how my eyes the purest blue… He said I had good breeding and he would love to someday meet my parents. I was starting to collect myself to get the fuck out because at this point I frankly didn’t give a fuck where he was going with any of this, I just wanted out. He then told me that he wanted to show me something and pulled off his shirt. I couldn’t even pretend to partially conceal the disbelief at what I saw – his entire chest and arms completely covered with tattoos, all of them racist and depicting symbols of white supremacy. This fucked up guy who I had been chilling with for just over a month turns out to be the biggest white supremist I have ever personally known and wanted me because of how racially pure my features seemed to be. I was a ‘purebred’. This guy was fucked. I told him I really couldn’t handle this, that it was something that I was in no way interested in being a part of or even associated with. He was not pleased. He told me that I would change my mind, that he could make me see – I asked how, brainwashing? He said that someday I would bear him a child and he knew this. I asked what kind of fucking system he was trying to re-create and told him I would have no part of it whatsoever. He was mad, I grabbed my shit and literally went running from his apartment hearing his swearing and yelling of what a mistake I was making behind me.  &nbsp;  Speaking with a mutual friend much later he told me stories about ‘Will’ and how this guy was apparently connected pretty high up within a couple major&nbsp;supremacy groups. For him to consider that I was of good breed was a considerable compliment coming from this person. Knowing what I do now I would have been more content just to have been considered a brood mare.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I was panhandling on the corner of Yonge and Maitland. This was our spot, myself and another girl who used to rotate during peak hours. Just down on College Street was where we would get our sleeping bags during the winter time from the Police Headquarters.&nbsp; In the evenings when we weren’t ‘panning’ together we had this big guy we knew, Sam, who would sit across the street and watch out for us for a small fee.  &nbsp;  He was there with his coffee on one particular night when I sitting alone on the steps begging the tourists for their spare change. I always did better when I was alone because I appeared to be just some little, young, innocent girl that even the most hardened passers by would take pity on.  &nbsp;  About an hour or two into this session a strange man approached me. He didn’t appear to be homeless and was dressed quite well. He was clean-shaven and his hair neatly cut and styled. If I were to guess I’d have to say he was probably in his early 40’s. At first I thought maybe he was trying to get past me on the steps to go into the clear unmarked doorway that was the entrance to one of the bathhouses. I was mistaken.  &nbsp;  He said hello and told me his name was Stephen. He asked me a couple of questions, typical questions that a lot of people ask before they give up their money: how old was I, how long had I been on the streets, what happened to put me there, didn’t my parents care… I had all the answers down pat and could answer them perfectly with no thought given whatsoever. But he kept talking, telling me useless shit. I was confused and getting impatient. Across the street I could tell Sam was becoming a bit concerned about the length of time this man kept speaking to me. After a few more minutes he began to make his way over.  &nbsp;  But then, good ol’ Stephen decided to make me quite a proposition. He asked if we could go around the corner to one of the darker parking lots and he would pay me a $100 dollars to spank him for five minutes. My first response was ‘absolutely no’. But then he continued to barter with me, to negotiate. He raised the payment to $150. I laughed and said that the only way this was ever going to happen for that amount was if 1) Sam was standing there with us, 2) I used one of his leather gloves to do it because there was no way in hell I was allowing my skin to come into contact with any part of his flesh, let alone his ass, and 3) I would only given him 10 whacks – nothing more and not for five minutes. He didn’t even think about it and gave no hesitation before agreeing. I had to repeat my offer more than once to make sure he understood – he did. Sam did his little intimidation thing to make sure the guy understood that we were not to be fucked around with, Stephen nodded and handed over the $150. We went around the corner and I did what I said I would, then I took off.  &nbsp; As I was walking away with Sam extremely pleased over the amount that about 60 seconds of work got us, I turned and looked back. Stephen was still there pants down facing a wall – I didn’t even want to imagine what he was doing or pleasure he was deriving at the thought of some young girl just giving him ten whacks with one of his own leather gloves.

      It was the month before my 17th birthday. I had been on a five day pcp binge complimenting it with bouts of hash oil. The girl who I was staying with, Eryn, and I had not moved our asses from the couch in about two days, people just kept bringing us more pcp and more oil. We just kept sitting there doing it all and waiting for the next drop off. Earlier in the binge we had been much more energetic, much more optimistic.  &nbsp;  On that fifth day a guy we knew, Joel, came over with a big glad freezer bag filled with smaller bags of pcp. He offered, we accepted. Sitting there going on our next ‘up’ he told us he was going to be driving to Toronto in an hour for a week and asked us to join him. A ‘little’ vacation he called it. We were so high and growing weary of not being able to move that we accepted. He gave us a few pills, speed, and sent us packing. I can’t even remember what it was I packed exactly but I know that in my frame of mind I brought nothing that was of any use, except maybe one of my Pixies albums. I remember how good that shower felt; I had forgotten what it was like to shower in those few days, I was in no way focused on being clean, only on being high.  &nbsp;  The three and a half hour drive to Toronto was spent doing rails off the dashboard at rest stops and on the side of the road. Doing rails while Joel was driving was from empty cigarette packs. By the time we pulled up to the penthouse at 33 Davisville we were so toasted I didn’t know what was up or down, or left or right or even where the fuck I was anymore. I do remember seeing a Golden Griddle and thinking to myself that if I ever came down I should go there and eat some pancakes while drinking coffee in the morning, trying my hand at being a normal citizen. That time wouldn’t come for many months, and even then I wasn’t very good at faking it.  &nbsp;  Up at the penthouse apartment we met a whole bunch of Joel’s friends and there was much celebration at his returning for a visit, a celebration I heavily reaped the benefits of. We didn’t leave this apartment for another three days. It got to the point where you couldn’t tell what pile of powder was what, not that you really cared as long as it went up the nose without too much pain and got you high. I was fed pills as though grapes in harems of ancient times, keys holding bumps of whatever powder were brought up to my nose as I laid there on the futon out on the balcony where you got the best breeze and could stare at the all city lights. I loved those lights back then, they held so much promise and seemingly endless possibilities… We would lie there and create great stories of different scenarios that were taking place to strangers on the streets down below - if only I could ever get up off that futon and leave the apartment. Which by the fourth or fifth day I finally managed to do.  &nbsp;  This guy, Rob (who I had somehow started sleeping with when we first got there) and I went down to Queen street to this little club night they used to call Freak Show. I don’t even think we went inside, just sat around on the curb with the little punks and ravers getting more and more high. One guy I had never met hugged me and pinched my cheek telling me I was beautiful and so incredibly adorable he could barely stand it. He told me to wait one minute and he’d be right back. When he returned he dropped a little bag that had a gram of coke in it onto my lap. Then he knelt in front of me and took my face in his hands and holding it up so that he could stare straight in my eyes. He told me it was mine, now could we go to Grange Park so I could suck his dick? I was confused. I declined, but most politely. He got up, shrugged his shoulders and told me to keep the coke anyways.   Rob and I decided that we missed the penthouse and the feeling of security it provided, that in a way we preferred to watch the city from a distance because what we could imagine was going on was so much better than what we were experiencing and seeing. Although we both felt happy and satisfied at finally having left on an outing for a least a little while. High and antsy we started walking to catch the late night bus because the subways were closed. But when we got to the bus stop on Yonge Street, we didn’t say a word and just kept on walking. We walked all the way back up to Davisville but didn’t notice the distance at all and kept stopping to have cigarettes or make out a bit or do some of the coke I had been given or pcp he had acquired. There was a bench right by Mount Pleasant cemetery that we had sex on in those hours of our walk home. It wasn’t romantic at all but it was a moment that had some kind of magic to it.  &nbsp;  At the end of the week I didn’t go back with Joel or Eryn. I stayed in Toronto at the penthouse for another couple of weeks and then grew weary of some of the guys that hung out there and their advances towards me. So I left. I had no money, a small backpack of belongings that included a toothbrush, a few random clothes, my Pixies cd, a loaf of bread and a half empty jar of Nutella. This is how I came to live on the streets for period of my teenage years.

      Summer nights in this town were gorgeous. We used to get high; it didn’t matter on what, and go down to the beach. It was dark and when the winds were strong the waves would crash and make the most beautiful sounds. The sky filled with stars seemed endless. There was an inexplicable heat in the air, also on such nights an eerie kind of silence.  A couple of friends of mine, Jim and Ian, used to live in this house on the beach. They had an enclosed small front porch that we used to sit in. All the porch contained, besides us, was a few old ratty chairs, a small round card table and a record player. As was the ritual, while we were smoking weed or oil Jim would play James Brown. It would always start with “Sex Machine”… and we would be silent for a few moments in respect, just nodding our heads. We used to joke that this old house was haunted, the noises it would sometimes make late in the night made you shift uncomfortably in your seat. But the ‘ghosts’ always seemed to accept our offering of James Brown to them because even they remained still in those moments.  Ian had a big orange van. Not a dull or worn orange, bright and aggressive and pumpkin coloured. James Brown was not played in this van. Ian preferred The Grateful Dead, or Jane’s Addiction, The Pixies, or Phish – these were acceptable. The van’s name was Linus and no van would be loved like this one in that town for many years until Linus laid at rest and another came to be, but that is a story for a different time.  My friend Shauna and I were hanging out and had started doing pcp a few hours earlier when we received a phone call from Ian. It was jokingly frantic, begging us to come to the house immediately that it was time and Linus was ready. He told us to bring all substances we could. I heard the urgency in his voice, but we still took our time dawdling and distracted on the walk.   We stopped by the main beach to smoke a joint and ran into two guys who were around our age. They were sitting in the sand on a blanket I can’t remember their names now. The one with dreads was playing an acoustic guitar, the other was playing a small hand-made drum. They invited us over to sit with them and we shared our joint while they shared their music. They were hitchhiking from Vancouver, on their way to visit friends in Toronto and then eventually end up in Halifax for the busker’s festival.  During the summer months in this town you could always count on running into hitchhikers, this town was a main stopover or hub for anyone heading out west or coming from there. We shared some of our alcohol and pcp while we sat with them and they told us stories of their travels so far.   Suddenly, maybe an hour or so later I remember Ian and Linus. I invited the hippies but they declined, said they wanted to spend the night on the beach and sleep under the stars to the sounds of the waves. For our company and kindness they gave us a bag of shrooms and told us that whatever Linus may be ready for, this would make us ready for Linus.  So we continued on our way and finally came to the house. Ian was sitting on the front lawn with legs crossed and appeared to be meditating. He was relieved and happy that we had finally come fearing that something had happened because it had been so long since we spoke and his consistent phone calls only came to our voicemail. We followed him to Linus, parked in the driveway and he slid open the side doors. Candles were lit all over the inside, blankets and pillows had been laid all over the floor of the van. In one place there was a huge container of something I didn’t recognize with some brushes carefully laid out beside it. In another place there was a huge, HUGE pile of rags and cloths.  We climbed into Linus and Ian slid the door closed. He said the time had come – we were going to podgy Linus. For anyone who doesn’t know, Podge is this glue type stuff that you can do decoupage with. The three of us began with huge rails of pcp, followed by eating the bag of shrooms that had been a gift from the hippies, and lit a joint. What happened next is a complete blur. I remember music, I remember bits of material everywhere and podge all over our clothes and skin. We remained in Linus through the night and most of the next day working ever so diligently. Then we must have fallen asleep.   When I woke up it was dark again, another day passed. Ian and Shauna were asleep on the floor near me. I couldn’t believe my eyes. There was not one square inch of the inside of Linus that had not been covered (except the floor) with cut out pieces of material or paper and podge.  Images that could be recognized and collages that couldn’t. Bright coloured words spilled from the ceiling. The alphabet carefully wound around the top part of the van. “L-I-N-U-S” was posted in huge letters on the dashboard. Even the steering wheel had been covered.  I’ve never been an artist, but being a part of that night and what happened on Linus’ inner transformation was probably some of the best work I have ever done.

      It’s a damp night out, all foggy and mild and quiet. Like out of a Dostoevsky novel. It’s a strange night. I feel like I’m on the edge of something profound, whether realization or event I’m not sure.  And what I’m left with is this anxiety of expectation, of what once again I’m not sure.  This is a really unsettling feeling.  I’ve been pacing, trying to keep myself busy, drinking, watching the clock… and all for a reason I can’t pinpoint.  A million and one thoughts and possible scenarios are running through my mind, but none of them are clicking to the point where I let out the breath I feel like I’m holding in and say: “Ah, yes! So that’s it!” I keep thinking that maybe all of this is just because tonight is the first real night that I’ve taken it easy in a long time, and the first while in months that I’ve gone more than a day without ingesting something.  This is probably it, but it just feels like more right now.  I don’t fucking know…  I have a friend who is in a bit of tough place right now. I don’t think it ever gets easier to watch someone you’re close to go through a difficult time. Especially when you know it is required and there is no way around it.  But seeing things happen, well it takes a lot to sit back and let them run their course when all you want to do is step in and take complete control in order to rectify whatever situation may be causing them pain.  But you don’t, you can’t.  The same way we all have to deal with our issues in order to allow us room to learn and grow.  Seeing my friend go through this, hearing about it – well it brings back all of these emotions and fears erupting inside me.  Fears for myself, fears for my friend.  Fuck, how much do we hold back from each other and the people we care about for reasons we can’t even figure out?  No wonder we’re all wandering around lost and confused and feeling completely fucked up.  Honestly? All I want to do is to be able to turn to my friend and tell them all that I know, tell them what they need to do to make everything better and alright, I want to tell them how proud I am of them, how much faith I have in them and what they can do, how much respect I have for them… and more importantly, have them  really listen .  Have them  believe  me.  I want to soothe away all their fears and insecurities. And through this have them soothe away mine.  But it’s always those close to us, and I speak this of my own experiences only, that we listen to the least. We find more profound advice and comfort in people and places that have distance from what is near to our hearts and whatever situation we may be in.  We find comfort in falsities.  And those of us close, well we feel left behind and useless waiting for the ones we care about to come around, if they ever actually do is a completely different story.  We feel rejected because the help we want to offer is not accepted as readily as it is from others, we feel it goes by unnoticed.  But then we come full circle and ask ourselves if we really did ever offer it in the way we could have, in a way that would have made a difference.  There are so few people in this world I actually give half a shit about that it crushes me beyond belief when one of them is hurting and there is nothing I feel I can do to help ease it away.  But here I will continue to sit, being as I’ve always been in the past and simply wait, just in case the day comes when they turn to me and ask me for help, ready to listen and ready to believe me.

      This weekend was actually a lot more relaxed than I originally anticipated it being. It was good to catch up on some much needed sleep.  Saturday night I went by a big loft party that was going on downtown at someone’s studio space that I had never been to before. Somehow one of the guy’s who used to be a part of Platinum Blonde (and now owns a club here) was affiliated – he is not blonde now, if he ever was even. It was a gorgeous space and lots of seemingly interesting and cool people were there – but I just sat around being only midly social and not really feeling it.  Had a few cocktails and got pretty tipsy, but otherwise declined all further offers to indulge.  Came home fairly early at around 3:30a.m. and just crashed trying to catch up on some sleep.  Could have been a crazy night, I’m glad I didn’t feel the need to participate. When a friend asked me much later how it was, the only word that came to mind to describe it was “Typical”.  A better word I still can’t think of now.  Yesterday was a beautiful day, so I decided to hit the liquor store and pick up some good cocktail makin’ booze and throw a somewhat impromptu gathering out in my backyard.  I cannot even begin to say how much I am enjoying the yard.  We had the blender going strong and drank well into the night.  We even lit the tiki torches, which pleased me and made my journey into the shed last week seem to have some kind of purpose.  Our “Bundy” neighbours kept venturing out to their yard and you could tell they were curious and eavesdropping – so we didn’t hold back in making a spectacle and putting on one hell of a show.  I’m sure they believe at this point that we are quite unstable crackheads with hedonist tendancies.  It’s great.    This morning I woke up earlier than I would have liked and stumbled downstairs feeling the full force of one hell of a hangover.  As I poured the coffee and went outside I found the remnants of a project we had started last night in our druken stupor.  We have occasional racoons which venture into our yard and had tried to concoct some kind of noise-making device to scare them off which would hang from the fence to the tree and do this dangle here with an extra doo-dad over there… I have no fucking clue.  My memory is fuzzy and what may have made sense last night makes absolutely none now.  So as I was trying to put the pieces together the patio door slides open and my room-mate appears more chipper than he ever should be at that hour. His hair was completely disheveled and puffed out to the max. He hadn’t shaven in about 2 days so a beard was coming on strong. He was wearing a white fitting tank top, bright purple satin pajama bottoms with stars on them, and a black pair of clogs.  He had a coffee in one hand and cigarette in the other. He gave me a wicked smile and suddenly broke into a merry dance singing, “I feel pretty! I feel pretty! Oh so pretty and witty and gay!” (Or however the song goes) He is definitely gay and has never seemed more flaming to me than in that instant.  I nearly killed myself falling off of our deck because I was laughing so damned hard. Wow. I’m still trying to recover from that one.

      Went and had a nice dinner at a jazz club with a new friend yesterday evening.  A couple of cocktails and of course me on my best behavior. It was very prim and proper, small talk about all the "normal" things in life, essentially putting the pretty pink frosting on our respective cakes.  It was alright although I was fairly distracted and in my mind was making a game of the whole affair, trying to keep all lewd and sarcastic comments to myself and actually think before speaking - it was a challenge and made the two hours pass by with much amusement. I think for our next meeting I will let it all out and see what kind of a reaction I receive, I'm sure my friend thinks he has me pegged as a nice and centered person. Then again, wouldn't I laugh hysterically if he was a demented soul too, also on his best behavior. When we parted he was going home to watch a movie and sleep. I did not.  One of my oldest and closest friends is in the profession of domination and submission - specifically domination. Recently she has just started her own dungeon with another girl she has worked with in this industry over the past couple of years. They had an opening/industry party there last night to celebrate, which of course I could not resist going to after I parted ways from my dinner. It was pretty fun, lots of cocktails and champagne.  Lots of party favors to match the indulgence I felt I deserved after being such a "good girl" for the majority of the night thus far.  Perhaps a little too much pleather for my liking, but hey, each to their own.  What I was most pleased with however was the fact that they have already acquired a few house boys or house slaves. They are gay men who don't pay for sessions but rather are pretty much at the dungeon's beck and call to run errands, use as practice slaves, give pamperings , just whatever.  In exchange for them being the house bitches, they receive their beatings and sessions for free.  They are lifestylers, unlike many of the upscale business clientele my friend caters to. They live and breathe their entire lives within the S&M world.  I took absolute delight in their presence at the dungeon last night. And I found even more pleasure in their requests for me to boss them around.  I was someone new whom they could address and take care of on the only condition that I treated them like shit, administered mild beatings and humiliations.  Fun, fun stuff.  Couldn't do it for a living, but they were pretty sweet on me so the next time I'm feeling like I need to burn off some extra hostility, I know where to go.    I should also note that unfortunately the theory my room-mate and I had regarding my neighbour being a skimpy bikini wearer were proven right today.  It was a most disturbing sight, just as we predicted. One of her dogs is also currently wearing one of the neck cones (not sure why) which is incredibly funny... however does not provide much compensation for the visuals we were forced to endure.

      All around us we deal with opinions. Opinions we may agree with and those we may not. There are lines when crossed where opinions just become insults.  When the vain and naïve begin with their sarcasm to call others pretentious.  When very narrow minds lead to very cramped views.  Why would one keep, or even start, a blog?  Possibly for communication with others, possibly for group ideas and theories to be put out there in some kind of organized format, possibly as an output for their teen angst, possibly out of boredom, and  just possibly  (although maybe I’m going out on a limb with this crazy idea) for  self-expression . Peoples ideals of how they express themselves are going to be different. We are not carbon copies of one another, which I know is once again a  completely  bizarre idea – what are we doing not thinking and acting all alike???  Some may feel good about writing long exaggerated posts of “Why I Am So Clever” and “Why I Am So Wise” (misunderstood of course). Some may just enjoy writing nonsense. Some may use it as a forum to talk about things they enjoy or love. Others may look towards a blog as a place where they can put their thoughts, their ideas, their ponderings out into the world as a tool to help them gain perspective for themselves.  Some people will never be complacent with how the world is presented to them and will search to understand it better, they will search to understand themselves and their place in this world better.  I’ve found a blog has proved to be a great tool to aid in this, with which I’m sure an army of people would agree.  People are often quick to point out the negativity of something and simply choose to put it down because in their petty minds they know of no other alternative.  It's too bad because those people are limiting their own growth as individuals in their narrow-mindedness.  It’s certainly unfortunate that all blogs aren’t the same, with the same kind of people spitting out the same kind of arrogant nonsense.  Maybe I should take this time to start up a new blog in which I would fit into the mould of what would make those people happy. Hmmm….

      I woke up today feeling incredibly antsy.  I paced from the kitchen, through the dining room, into the living room and back around, out to the deck, watered the garden, had some coffee (probably not the solution to dimming excess energy), changed cat litter... it's just gone on and on for awhile now.  I just have no clue what to do with myself.  I wish I was more of a sporty person so I could go and do sporty things.  I have found a great bar/restaurant by my house.  It is Russian/Ukrainian - the food is fabulous.  It looks kind of dingy from the outside, but inside is actually pretty nice and it's won all these awards.  After grabbing a bite to eat and having a couple of drinks one the waitresses brought over these HUGE shots of vodka and these fancy glasses and said that they were from this guy at the bar - looking at him he was clearly trashed and raised his glass to us "the pretty ladies". Wow, that vodka burned something viscous. But we discovered that by the time you were done the second one, it was really only more of a pleasant warmth.  The man came over and kept buying us shots and we kept eating more food and getting wasted.  He gave us what would have to have been a small book if printed, of reasons why Russian men are the best to marry and that should we ever get married to a Russian to come back to that restaurant and he would pay for all the drinks of our engagement party - as long as they were vodka.  I just can't believe how huge these shots were. I felt like I stepped into some kind of weird movie hanging out with all the Russians getting wasted, speaking in their thick accents and getting pretty wild.  My high point in the night: One of the men taught me how to say "You have very nice breasts" and "You are a monkey" in Russian.  Let me explain: Years ago I had a friend who was taking Russian in university.  He walked around all the time saying the same phrase over and over.  He taught this phrase to me and it so happened to be "You have very nice breasts", but just the sound of the words together was so pleasing to the ears...  That was my one Russian phrase, but over time I forgot.  Now I know it again and I am pleased.  The monkey bit?  Well, eons ago a friend of mine taught me how to say "You are a monkey" in Portuguese.  Since then whenever I meet someone who speaks a different language, I always ask them to teach me how to call someone a monkey.  I think it's extremely important to know how to say this to someone no matter what country you're in (hehe).  To date I can officially call someone a monkey in English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese, one of the dialects from the Philippines (not sure which one), Italian, and now Russian. I think I'm pretty set, no?  Anyhoo, it was lots of fun and I can imagine myself going back there in the future.  One thing that was pleasing, although there were lots of old Russian men, none of them were creepy or trying to hit on us - so it was just good ol' drunken fun. Oh, and as the night went on they became more and more aggressive about arm wrestling and kept having little matches over the tables. They were very kind to include me and my friend, but we were no match for them and they were good enough not to pretend to let us win... at all.  I like the Russians by my house.  Another mildly amusing tidbit: I have this tracking thing to count the hits to my blog. It also tells you the links or paths that were taken by people to get to my blog. I found two hits yesterday that came from people who were doing searches on Google for "dirty crosswords". HAHAHAHAHHA It makes me giggle and I admit provides me with much amusement to think that when someone Googles "dirty crosswords" my blog is one of the results that come up. It makes me want to randomly type strange phrases in my posts in order to throw people off when they're searching for things. Midget anal sex.

      walking i pace the quiet streets no stars out tonight although i think i see a satellite shining from above i wonder what the woman  in the window is doing that she wears no clothes and sits in quiet contemplation perhaps she is sitting for a portrait to be painted  by any passer by perhaps she is sitting just for me to write her this poem and although she has  rippling wave after wave of flesh pouring over her stomach her stillness is beauty in its imperfection and a fine substitution for the lack of stars

      I got a phone call from my mother tonight - apparently it has been determined that my great aunt has a brain tumor, a cancerous one.  It is because of this that she has lost sight in one eye and the doctors say it is only a matter of weeks before she loses the sight in her second eye. She is already feeling the psychological and behavioral effects of this tumor. They don't know how long she will last period. She told my mother that she doesn't care, she says she's done "here" and just wants it to be over now so that she can go and be with her sister, my grandmother.  When my grandmother was alive she said that she was done "here" and was just waiting for it all to be over so that she could go and be with her husband, my grandfather.  My mother says that she is fed-up with  "here" and has too many regrets.  There is too much sadness all around us.  I often find it too overwhelming and am unsure how to handle it.  I look at the people I love and I'm not sure if it comforts me that they seem lost too, or if it discourages me because although generations older than me they still haven't found themselves.  Probably more than anything else I fear being 80 and 1) having nothing but regrets (coulda, shoulda, woulda), and 2) feeling nothing but emptiness, simply sitting there waiting for the day when it will all be over.  Can it get any more fucking depressing?  I fear it especially because I have witnessed all too closely these things in people who are close to me.  I mean, we can say "I will live my life to fullest  and live every day like it's my last with no regrets", but are we? Or do we just keep telling ourselves this hoping that in its repetition we will one day start to believe it and act upon it?  I tell myself this: "I have no regrets for anything I have done regardless of the pain it may have caused me because without every wound, every stab, every tear, every ache I would not be the person I am today."  For the past I feel nostalgia.  For the future I feel terrified of the possibility of what I fear most happening.  What if I hit old age and right before my time comes with a smash to my heart I suddenly realize how wrong I've been?  I know it's fruitless to worry about these things, these things that haven't happened, that might not happen.  I know that it's ridiculous and that instead I should take the energy I use worrying and direct it towards goals and purpose in order to ensure that my fears don't manifest.  But, and I've written this before, my head and my heart (all emotions) have not been in synch for some long while. How does one make themselves believe, I mean truly believe, something that is common sense and ultimately the truth?  So often I look at my life, going over all the details, analyzing all points and I feel similar to when I repeatedly type or say the same word over and over again -  after a certain point it loses it's meaning, maybe you even forget what it means for a few minutes and then you start doubting that you are even spelling it correctly...  Here I make a confession to you:  I have no fucking clue what I'm doing.  And I don't have any idea how to do any of this.  But then again, despite all façades and masks, do any of us really know? Or are we just trying to fool one another in hopes of providing some kind of false comfort that someone, somewhere knows something????

      Today in my mailbox  I found a beautiful cream envelope with italic silver lettering spelling out my name and address.  I knew what it was in an instant and my first instinct was to throw it in the garbage can on my front porch and walk away, never to think of it again.  It’s strange how when we come face to face with something in our lives (in its many different aspects) that we don’t want to know or acknowledge we simply do that; throw it away and pretend like we never saw it, like it never existed and that is what enables us to cope.  Well, at least I do that.  All the time actually.  This envelope contained yet another wedding invitation.  F-U-C-K.  Another person I know has left my safe world and is about to begin on a journey that is more foreign and frightening to me than any other.  It’s not that I get all upset and weepy when I get these things, fearful that my day won’t come.  Frankly, I don’t really care if that day comes for me or not, I’m not even sure I would want it to come for me.  It’s just what it represents.  The so-called “adult” world, a world whose existence I have been in firm denial of for only God knows how long.  Planting roots and making commitments? Eek!  Blasphemy, I say!  Call me some awful name, but when I see these people getting married, I feel the same way as when I hear that someone I know is pregnant: their life is over.  Period. I guess a lot of people would view it as their life just beginning, but I don’t know… it appears to me that too many doors and choices are closing in their faces once they utter the words “I do”.  I can’t imagine being 80 and having regrets or being haunted by “what if’s” all because I made a decision based on my feeling of  “love” for another person.  But I know it's not like that for everyone...  Maybe I’ve become a skeptic in the land of “love”.  Maybe when I heard two days ago that another one of my married friend couples had decided to divorce that this just further proves my point.  I mean, people are growing up around me and I watch them making these HUGE decisions and then I watch all that they believed in and built themselves around fall to pieces… and what are they left with then???  I’m not saying I’m anti-marriage period, I know a few great examples of people who are truly in love and will probably be married forever, actually meaning those vows that they took on “their” day.  But realistically the ratio of those people to just normal people who marry and then divorce when their illusions come crashing down is pretty steep.  But I still do wish the best for the people I love and do hope that it does work out for them.  My resentment at friends getting married also has to do with this: I hate that people are moving in different directions and apparently settling down and becoming honest citizens of our society, going through the motions and just “growing up” into the stereotypes that have been laid before us.  I feel like this is adding pressure on me to do the same.  Oh, the worst is running into someone from your past and they are all settled with 2.2 kids and the white picket fence and so “mature and aged” and there you are, basically exactly the same as 6 years ago.  That “look” that they give you… I can barely handle even the thought of it.  But I know this is my own issue – an issue I have with myself and the fuckup that I fear I am so often.  I swear half the time I only keep my awful corporate yuppie job just so that when I do talk to people I can come across as having somewhat gotten my shit together, which is a complete façade of course because I feel anything but that way.  You know what my scary age is? (And everyone has one) 28 years old.  Not very old for a scary age, I realize this, but it was embedded in me when I was super young and 28 seemed sooooo old then.  I set out as a child that by the time I reached 28 I would have the following accomplished: I would have my career which of course would be doing something I loved and made me happy and which I made great money doing. I would be married to the love of my life with a child on the way to be born when I was 29 (so that there wasn’t too much of age difference between us out of fear that I wouldn’t be able to relate to them). I would own a house…  Essentially: I would have the picture perfect life. Sticking with my "plan" I have two years left to accomplish this.  HAHAHAHHAHA. (Anyone who knows me will know exactly how funny this thought is) I can’t even comment on how unrealistic those are and I can’t even confirm if I would ever want half of what I should have according to my life plan.  It’s incredible how one’s ideals change and yet the original image still remains and you feel as though you have somehow let yourself down when you don’t reach those original goals – even if you don’t want any of them anymore!!!  All of this has my head spinning, the vodka I drank too much of tonight also might have a hand in this (hehehe)  I should just go to sleep and deal with the invitation tomorrow and my smile (in which I try to cover the pity and fear) which I will give my old friend with the appropriate congratulations and “you were meant for each other, I’m sure you’ll have a wonderful life”…

      "The nostrils of her face over-widened just far enough to destroy the first impression of exquisite harmony and allow for lust"  "I’m not a good lover or I’d be with you now. I’d be beside you, not using this longing for a proof of feeling. That’s why I’m writing you and sending you this summer’s journal. I want you to know something about me. Here it is day by day. Dearest Shell, if you let me I’d always keep you four hundred miles away and write you pretty poems and letters. That’s true. I’m afraid to live any place but in expectation. I’m no life-risk. At the beginning of the summer we said: let’s be surgical. I don’t want to see or hear from you. I’d like to counterpoint this with tenderness but I’m not going to. I want no attachments. I want to begin again. I think I love you, but I love the idea of a clean slate more. I can say these things to you because we’ve come that close. The temptation of discipline makes me ruthless."  "No, he wouldn’t go to New York.  He knew that.  But he must always be connected to her. That must never be severed. Everything was simple as long as he was connected to her, as long as they remembered. One day what he did to her, to the child, would enter his understanding with such a smash of guilt that he would sit motionless for days, until others carried him and medical machines brought him back to speech. But that was not today."   *** Excerpts from The Favourite Game by Leonard Cohen    "But where we have given of our love and respect not from habit but of our own free will, where we have been disciples and friends out of our inmost hearts, it is a bitter and horrible moment when we suddenly recognize that the current within us wants to pull away from what is dearest to us. Then every thought that rejects the friend and mentor turns in our own hearts like a poinsoned barb, then each blow struck in defense flies back into one's own face..."   *** Excerpt from Demian by Hermann Hesse

      you believe yourself to be a martyr among those who know you deviating from the respected paths of our predecessors dwelling in dark places where sex and drugs  deem who is chosen king  you've always been a fool  those around you do not have awe in their eyes at your experiences and tall tales of adventure in the underworld it is easy to confuse pity with admiration but your place here is trivial and you will not find reassurances

      Inspiration.  This morning my thoughts are on what inspires me.  What is it that gives me goosebumps? That makes some kind of pulse through my being, a pulse that makes me feel like I have drank too much coffee and must get up, get out and do something? That leaves me in awe? That makes me feel like I do have it in me to follow dreams? That makes me want to be a better person?  That brings joyful tears to my eyes because it is the most obvious thing that I never noticed before until put into perspective?  I like things that liven my senses, that make me think and view things in a different way.  More specifically things, events, or people that appear on the surface to be extremely normal and mundane and yet somehow aren’t.  I am inspired when someone can look at something so commonplace and find its beauty, its complexity and describe it in such a way that it appears anything but ordinary.  I am inspired when I find perfection in imperfection, when those blemishes are suddenly taken and turned into something radiant. I am insprired by those seemingly “perfect” moments, when all external and internal factors seem to be in sync with one another even if only for one brief instant.  I am inspired by the beauty of words.  I am inspired by random acts of kindness. I am inspired when someone has the strength to take their dreams and follow them.  I am inspired when I see walls break down and someone’s true self is revealed. I am inspired when people allow themselves to feel things and experiences in all their rawness. I am inspired by music and when all sounds come together to form a beautiful and exquisite piece that makes my heart and mind want to scream out in gratitude and disbelief.  I am inspired when someone whom I know well and for a long time suddenly does something that surprises me and shows me a part of them I never knew.  I am inspired by the unexpected.  I am inspired by anything that can just make me "feel" something.  Reading back over this, you'd think I'd be walking around inspired all the time by everything, but it feels like it happens rarely.  Although, I'm willing to bet big money these things are occuring around me constantly and I'm just not taking notice.  Hard to find beauty and stillness in an environment that is fast and often overwhelming.  We always notice the bullshit before we notice the beauty - maybe because we're quick to react when we're drowing and lacking in air to breathe, if only we could open our eyes as to what it is that would serve as a lifeboat.  That and I think we use our ailments and woes in life as bonding tools. It's too often our hardships that will bring us together rather than our shared amusements and joys. But then again, would be as thankful of these seemingly rare inspired and "perfect" moments if we viewed them as typical and ordinary?  Probably not.

      We have a shed in the backyard of the house that we just moved into.  Looked in it briefly just after we got here and there was some stuff but nothing that really caught my eye.  Anyways, so tonight after a brief temper tantrum at the Simpsons not being on because in my extremely delayed state I thought it was Sunday, I decided it was high time for me to head out there and dig around to see if anything interesting had been left by the previous residents.  Some soil, plastic milkcrates, paint stuff and the only thing that really pleased me: tiki torches (sp?).  I can’t wait to put them up in our yard for summer blender drink parties.    But... this got me thinking about a discovery I once made in a house I used to live in years ago.  Digging out in that shed I found about four of the BIG blue recycle boxes, and digging in a bit deeper discovered that they were filled with porn magazines, mostly Hustler. I guess the jocks that lived there previously didn’t hold them too highly.  So those magazines were left untouched in that shed and became a running joke in our house.  One day doing some cleaning around the bedroom I happened upon one of those Hustlers hidden away on my boy-friend at the time side of the closet.  I pulled it out and started skimming to see exactly what it was that he was pulling it to when I wasn’t around, and THAT’S when I came across the real treasure: dirty crossword puzzles.  I was so entranced by the damn thing I just sat down right there on the floor and started filling it out.  My boy-friend found me, and although he may have been confused, he asked no questions – I suppose just grateful because he thought I would freak out over finding it.  I’ve never been one of those girls who gives a shit about porn, fuck.  Anyways… awhile later I was at the house during an afternoon by myself (much like this evening) and was bored so I ran out to the shed and started dragging in those blue boxes and spreading the magazines across the living room floor, doing each and every dirty crossword I could find.  It was in the midst of my porn crossword frenzy that my boy-friend, my 2 room-mates and all their friends came home and found me there… hehehehehe The looks on their faces still make me giggle now.    My point is: I wish I had found something interesting like that in our shed today, something that would have entertained me and help pass the time.  The tiki torches were just not amusing enough, stake them in the ground and you’re done.   And the only porn I found here (surprisingly for what huge jock/frat boys the guys who lived here before were – I guess they valued their porn more) was some stupid poster of a naked woman which I stuck on the wall of my one gay room-mate’s bedroom while he was out because I was angry at him and breasts make him uncomfortable.  I’m feeling a little bitter towards him now, I wish I had found some really nasty porn to decorate his room with tonight...  And yes, I am still sleepless.

      Still no sleep.  After tossing and turning for way too long I ventured downstairs to find something useless on television that would hopefully aid in sedating me.  This is what I found:  1)OxyContin is heroin for hillbillies.  I'd heard something of this before, but not the exact term "hillbilly heroin" which made me giggle something awful.  Just an image of the Beverly Hillbillies all sitting around getting whack shooting up prescription painkillers was too much for this tired mind to handle, as I started to create hypothetical episodes revolving around this behavior.  2)They have come up with "Perc-A-Pops", which is essentially percoset made into a lolli-pop for easier ingestion by cancer patients. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  Maybe it is easier for people who are ill, but I'm sorry, those pharmaceutical companies know exactly what they are doing and I'm sure not only do they cater to the terminally ill or those simply in "pain". I'm sure they have a secret marketing department hidden somewhere that thinks up schemes which will aid in the "junkies" cause.  3)Brad Pitt is apparently the stinkiest celebrity.  This wasn't from television but a website.  Come on... how do they know?  Do they run around Hollywood conducting surveys among the stars?  Or do they say it's in the name of science and gather a whole bunch of stars together, sit them each in separate rooms for a period of time with little electronic gadgets which monitor the increases in bodily odor then allowing them to come out with a formal and most educated report?  Ah well, maybe through this article Brad will gain some kind of promotion with a deodorant company or some crazed fan will send him a lifetime supply.

      I re-discovered an older album this weekend that used to be one of my favorites years ago: Tom Waits – Rain Dogs.  What a fucking great album, I can’t believe I forgot about it and how good it is.  Someone described Tom Waits as a “barroom balladeer”, which I think is probably the best description of him I have ever heard – fits perfectly.  I remember the first time I ever heard him, I was like “Yeah! Who is this old huge black man from the south with the deep scratchy raw bluesy voice?”  Then I saw his picture – little white tired and drunk looking young man.  I love when things just don’t fit together sometimes, it provides a most pleasant surprise.  I really like that kind of surprise. However with this I am also reminded how much irritation I feel towards Rod Stewart’s horrible version of Downtown Train. He turned it into some pretty easy listening song, taking away it’s creepy stalkerish quality – which in my opinion is what the song is supposed to portray anyways… damn Rod Stewart for that.  Now: Sometimes I hate this city too much, not its actual existence but more the existence that I have led here.  This city is haunted by my ghosts.  It’s like every experience, every feeling, every moment is somehow scarred into the concrete and buildings and becomes a part of what Toronto is made of.  These wounds open too easily leaving the possibilty for me to feel at almost any instant crippling sadness, madness, anger, joy, nostalgia…  I know its like this for anyone who has lived in one place for a long time and during a period of rapid and violent growth and self-discovery, it’s unavoidable but this fact doesn’t make it any easier. Maybe this is just one of the reasons why in the past I have run from place to place, city to city always trying to escape those scars.  Maybe it’s no accident or coincidence you come across these things and reminders, maybe it’s someone somewhere trying to drop a big fucking hint that the issues you thought you had dealt with years ago, well… apparently you haven’t.  The other night I discovered a fairly new acquaintance lives about a 10 minute walk from me.  As we’re coming up to his walkway another friend we’re with stops and turns looking at this huge building across the street that I hadn’t paid any notice to and made a comment that it has always given her the horrible creeps with it’s strange entrance and cold exterior – it was not like your average office building.  As I turned to look, the first thing I saw was the address sitting as a medal upon its wall facing the street, big and gold and almost taunting me.  I began to feel my entire body tense and seize in recognition as my eyes scaled the building, cold and hard and tall and beige.  I felt so small in that moment.  I swear I stopped breathing.  I can get out my trusty thesaurus and write down a million and one synonyms to describe how I felt in that exact moment, but still I will never be able to get across how intense it really was. I know that building.  I will never forget that building, it’s image, that big gold address will forever be burned into my memory.  One of the worst days of my entire life took place in that building two years ago.  I have not seen it since and had put it completely out of my mind. It’s hard to recover quickly from a punch in the gut like I received in that moment, but a requirement especially when you’re in the company of people who are essentially strangers, people you party with and whom you wouldn’t even bother sharing your favourtie colour let alone something so personal.  It’s been haunting my thoughts ever since. I vowed never to go back to that street again.  I am afraid of other ghosts I have put out of mind over the years but will one day, when I am least expecting it and least prepared, come slamming back.  I am afraid of the scars I have left upon this city.

      So has come the point on a Sunday afternoon when, after no sleep, my hate lists and vile rants begin.  I have a short while to kill before the weekend picks back up and sleep isn’t an option right now, so this is my vent.  I fucking hate clubs way more often than not.  This makes me kinda sad considering that I love the music and often just want to go and hear it live and dance a bit.  It seems more and more nowadays that this is next to impossible to do, I end up getting completely agitated, aggressive, irrate and end up just bailing flustered beyond belief.  Now, I may be a smaller person but I can certainly hold my own and am quite capable of bluntly dealing with men’s advances whom I am not interested in, but why should I have to spend the majority of my time out defending myself against their pathetic attempts to “pick me up”?  It’s really fucking irritating.  I have never noticed it being as bad as it has been over the past months and several of my other girlfriends agree. It makes me question that no matter how much I may love the music, is it worth the agitation?  This weekend I was given great, great examples of men who will never get past hello with me and men who may actually have some kind of chance of continuing on with a conversation.  And I cannot even believe that men automatically assume all women are naïve and stupid and will fall for this shit.  They act surprised when I don’t jump at the chance to eat up all the bullshit they are trying to feed me.  This makes me wonder if the majority of women out there do fall for it, because if men had no kind of success rate would they actually keep on doing it? Pure jokes.  I cannot handle men sliding up behind me trying to grind against my ass while I’m dancing.  I cannot handle the old coming up and saying “Hey Rhonda” and when I reply that that I am not who they think I am the sad move in closer and “oh my mistake, well what is your name?”  I can’t deal with the “you want me, you’re interested you’re just playing hard to get to make sure that you’ll snag me”.  Above and beyond anything else I HATE men who do not respect personal space in any way.  Coming up and rubbing my shoulders, grabbing me by hips, touching my stomach…  Come on, fuck off!  When I go out, I just want to dance, hear good tunes and have a good time, not be molested and hit on every five mintues.  Bullshit.  Then:  after a friend’s art show at some gallery we go to this gathering at a loft we party at often.  Having a great time, good music, good conversation, good party favors for all…  This guy is talking to me all night in a completely normal way, not creepy, not drooling, NOT touching me, not incinuating anything – just chill.  I decide to bail to some other party with a couple of people and as I’m getting ready to go, the music kinda stops and the guy I was speaking with is at the system and announces rather loundly that everyone needs exit music and this is mine –then proceeded to put on Sweet Pea by Tommy Roe.  So fucking funny.  Now, there’s a way to get my attention, even if I might not be interested.  Creativity by men has been lost, too bad.  I think women need to stand up, get half-brains and stop falling for their bullshit, if we all did that I think we would be reasonably surprised by the results.  As for me?  I think it’s time to call it quits for clubs.  At least for any time other than extremely rare and special events.  Just not fucking worth it.  And so it's time now for the weekend to continue on. And on a slightly more positive note: way too many wicked parties and gatherings going on this weekend - way too much opportunity for me to get into trouble, which of course, I have been taking full advantage of. hehehe

      There is a middle school across the street from my house which I believe teaches students from mabye Grade 6 or 7 up to Grade 8.  They are having some kind of school concert/assembly right now where a school band was playing. Not like a marching band or anything, some kids in a band.  I was walking back from the store when I first heard it and they broke into a cover of The Clash’s London Calling.  How old are kids in Grade 8?  Maybe 13 or so?  I am extremely pleased.  The doors were open of the gym they were playing in and so I walked over and stuck my head inside.  They aren’t the best but they aren’t half bad, these young kids who are doing their part in keeping good music alive in a time where pop has agressively swooped in and taken over.  I admittedly had lost complete faith in kids of these days who are raised with the music of Brittney Spears, Christina Aguilera and the Backstreet Boys.   So I watched them and ended up staying for about an hour even after they had left the stage discussing how great their choice in music was with one of the younger teachers who was 29.  Their playlist not only included The Clash but also the Pixies, Led Zeppelin, T-Rex, Joy Division, the Ramones, the White Stripes, Ween, even The Rapture… WOW WOW WOW.  The other kids in the crowd were cheering, but their blank expressions led me to believe that they had no real idea what they were cheering for exactly – they were probably just happy at not being in class.  The teachers name I spoke to was Ryan, also great taste in music, he shares my extreme enthusiasm for Matthew Herbert – how great is it to find a kindred music spirit in the most unlikely of places when you least expect it.  He told me they had been practicing religiously for months working up to this one day in order to play the music that they love so much.  They are not the “cool kids”. I am not surprised, this makes me like them even more. I was like them growing up, with other kids making fun of me because of my lack of enthusiasm for New Kids on The Block, Tiffany, Milli Vanilli (sp?) and how Dylan, Zeppelin, or that “disco crap” was always playing in my walkman.  Maybe there is hope in music for the generation of kids who are starting to come into their own.  Maybe I don’t have to be so worried that the death of good music is just around the corner with everyone selling out to corporate sponsors and what is mainstream in order to make an extra dollar which seems to be the path most musicians are choosing nowadays.  If there are children this young pouring their hearts out into the great rock music of old, maybe there are also children who will be devoted to continuing on with the progression of electronic compostion, not just making noise that has something of a semi-consistant beat – but really being innovative as composers and trying to push the limits.  I like the way this day is starting.

      While perusing a fellow blogger’s page (thanks for the giggle, that’s awesome) , I found he had listed a site which offerred men the services of imaginary girlfriends.  Too funny!!  Essentially these girls will be their fake long-distance girlfriends, writing letters and creating a complete make-believe relationship at some guy’s expense.  I am still cracking up over this one, and even more so at the fact that men are actually buying this service… not that I should be surprised.  But… now I want to be an imaginary girlfriend (god, could you imagine???) hahahahahaha  A fake kind is probably the only relationship I'd actually be any good at keeping.  Drank too much tonight with my friend who’s in town.  I only realized after seeing her again exactly how much I missed that girl, I don’t have nearly enough girl friends – tend to stick with the boys more.  Sometimes it’s just fun to chill with girls and do silly girly things – we always have an awful way of getting into trouble and causing shit when we’re together, tonight was no exception but I should wait until I’m sober before deciding if I should share details. (This is me practicing self-restraint while intoxicated which is an extremely rare thing, yay me!) There is something going on outside on my street right now, not sure what but it's causing the most awful hideous horrible screeching sound.  Kind of like nails on a chalkboard but magnified by about 1000 times… It’s making me pretty uncomfortable.  A few things about today:  1)Spent the day making fun of my neighbor with my room-mate.  We realized that she is undeniably going to be one of those nasty skimpy bikini wearing older women and are trying to brace ourselves for it.    2)Saw the first sprouts of my morning glories that my room-mate planted as a present for me when I was having a sad day awhile ago (very pleased).  3)Started trying to come to terms with the fact that I have an obsession with cheese and dairy products.  The room-mates are very close to staging an intervention.  4)Made and had curry tofu and rice for the first time in ages – so yummy.  5)Found a new body lotion that is honey and brazil nut – it makes me want to gnaw my arm off it smells so damn good – I am very happy about this.  6)My cell phone decided to die a couple of hours ago, not sure what is going on with the network but my friends is down too.  I am bitter and feel crippled from this, booo. It is still not back up.  Ending this now.  It's 4am, I'm already rambling and I can feel my self-restraint waning.

      I have a friend who used to be an escort.  Now she is a nanny for the small children of two different families in an extremely posh and upscale part of the city.  She showed some concern at one of her families wanting to pay her under the table, and she wasn’t too thrilled about not paying taxes thinking it was going to add a mess to the income she has to declare next year.  I thought this was absolutely hilarious.. I mean considering she worked in an industry for years where you don’t exactly claim your income.  But she said that she had “reformed” now – which is a load of bullshit, but I let her have it.  This started a thought process which led to my concluding that Mary Poppins was probably an escort, or at the least a dominatrix, before she went to work as a nannie.  She probably would have done role playing as a school mistress or in some form of disciplinary position.  I mean, it wasn’t raining so much and she certainly wasn’t flying around enough to warrant her always carrying that umbrella – which if you look at it closely would have made an excellent tool for administering beatings.  Also, this would explain her relations with all those different chimney sweeps, no?  And maybe it wasn't by accident but a ingenius plot of the father that she suddenly "blew" into their home because he used to be a client of hers. But then again, with her spoon full of sugar she appeared to be reformed too…    Maybe nannies are what escorts become when they are trying to get out of the business and change their ways – which is a thought that amuses me greatly… one group of people we as a society try to keep away from our children are the ones who end up coming in and helping to raise them.  That’s just great.  I should start a business for “reformed” sex industry workers to come and be placed in upscale homes as care-takers… I would be like the “nannie” pimp.

      I have come to the conclusion that my neighbor is Peg Bundy with bleached blond hair.  She struts around with her little yappy dogs  in hot pink spandex capris, very high heels and little bright coloured tight shirts and tank tops and has no comprehension of what a normal volume for speaking should be.  She also has no concept of manners or being polite.  Her hair is very big and has been bleached way too many times.  She looks like she would be someone on a waiting list for plastic surgery but until she gets there she is going to douse her entire face with the heaviest, darkest make-up available on the market because “that’s what will make her look younger”.  I’ve also learnt that she has quite a fear and distate for rodents of all kinds, which amuses me greatly because I think that her itty bitty yapper dogs are actually a part of the rodent family themselves.  She likes to use the word “wild” after everything she says.  Her daughter who is about my age has taken all her fasion tips from her mother and is the biggest ditz I have come across in awhile, sitting with her friends in the backyard having conversations that complain how her past 6 sessions this week at the tanning bed have not made her dark enough yet and that consist of: “and then he like looked at me and I went psshhaww because as if I like would ever be caught dead going out with him and like totally embarrass myself and my reputation in that way”. As if her mother wasn’t doing a good enough job of that already.  And rumour in our neighborhood has it that the father is a drunk – I have not witnessed him intoxicated as far as I can tell, he just seems  very serious and is always trying to coerce my room-mate and I to take the yappers – even though we advised that if we did they would only end up as food for our two large dogs.  But… apparently he stole over the course of a short period of time his daughter’s university tuition one year and drank the whole thing away.  They also have little painted wooden house mailboxes that sit on poles on their front lawn that they just put up.  I have no preference but I am definitely not partial to the farmhouse one.  All I have to say is that if garden gnomes or pink flamingos start to appear on their lawn, I am going to have to put my foot down and intervene…

      Spent a quiet night with a few friends drinking wine in their backyard and re-confirmed that red wine and I are absolutely not compatible.  For some reason though, I keep on trying it hoping that maybe it was all in my head over the years and I’ll suddenly grow to appreciate it and it won't actually make me ill – kinda like my thing with tomatos.  Never works.  I suppose that I will always have to settle for good old white or blush.  A friend who I used to be close with a few years back gave me a call this evening.  We’ve kept in touch a bit via email, but usually will only do the routine check-in with each other once a month/once every two months. Anyways, so he called out of the blue and after some small talk told me that he was going to be leaving for California in three months for his work.  He’ll be setting up a permanent residence there, but doing quite a bit of travelling for his job all over the world.  It sounds like he’s finally landed the opportunity he always said he wanted as we used to lay on the beach smoking weed and drinking under the stars.  He sounds really happy and like he’s actually doing well in life, which makes me really happy for him, cause he’s definitely one of the good ones.    He knows that I’ve been at kind of an impass and stale point in my life over the past while, just going through motions and routines, kinda suspended and floating all lost and unsure.  Then he admitted that the real reason he was calling was to proposition me.  He has asked me to go with him, to pick up and move to California with my dog.  He says I deserve more than this and he wants the opportunity to be able to give it to me and take care of me.  I’m pretty floored over the whole thing.  I mean, who calls an old friend up after so long and asks them to leave their life to go and start a new one with them?  What floors me even further is the fact that I may actually be considering it.  It’s definitely an opportunity that I will probably never receive again, a great friend wanting to take me away and give me a chance at a completely clean slate with no attachments, no worries - he doesn’t even want me to pay for shit or get a job unless I want one in my spare time, hence providing me with complete financial support .  WOW.  He told me to think about it and not refuse right now, I agreed I would.  I’m confused and in extreme awe, with a million and one “what if’s” running through my mind at the speed of light.    I’m not sure of anything right now.  I’m fearful, suspicious, excited, blown away…  What makes people think so highly of others that they would want to help them and share their good fortune with them in this way?  What have I ever done to him to make him want to help me and have faith in me and what I can do in life?  Did the karma gods make a slip-up and just haven’t noticed yet?  Is this an opportunity or a distraction?  If I can't find myself here, can I actually find myself somewhere else, cause I've been down that road so many times.  How can you distinguish deep down if you're just wanting a new slate or running away from the one you curently have? I’m just not sure what to do with this kind of offer right now… sleep on it for a couple of months, and make no rash decisions as seems to be my forte in life.

      Had quite an interesting night... First, on the subway there were two men dressed as aliens, characters from Star Trek I think. My friend instigated a fight between them for planet earth by firing his mock phaser (finger guns) at them.  The lost their shit completely and ran to either ends of the train, rolling on the ground and trying to shoot each other with their plastic ray guns. They ran off at Bloor still shooting at one another from down the platform. They were probably doing it just to get a rise out of us and provide us with amusement and entertainment - it worked.  I'm curious who won. The brown wrinkly huge forehead guy, or the blue elephant man look-alike guy.  I've never been in the middle of an intergalactic war for earth before... I was very pleased.  Then, walking down the street to my house we encountered a man with a set of snowshoes who was pacing and mumbling to himself.  already feeling slightly wacky from the space war - as we approached I asked him what the snowshoes were for.  He was most pleasant and advised us that he was on his way to search for the abominable snowman.  Anyhoo, one thing led to another and we accepted the basic snowshoe lessons he offerred to us, which although brief, took place outside the school across the street from my house.  I was educated on the habits and history of the abominable snowman... and never knew that it was supposed to be such a hostile predator - but this guy made out that way, and he's supposedly the expert, so what do I know???  This all happened tonight within about an hour period.  I’m not sure if there is some kind of planetary conjuntion going on which could be the cause for the instability which has seemingly wrapped itself around this city, or if the great unknown decided to play a little trick on me because of the state I was in. Strange but definitely entertaining.  So, this is what uptown is like…

      They said that the moon collided with the sun, that this is what caused the explosion in the sky.  People dropped to their knees on the street praying to their paper-back God, believing it was the end, screaming of angels playing horns that I could not hear.  Children gawked as if fireworks on the first of July.  Others died from the millions of drops of fire falling from above.  Me – I ran… covering my ears, squeezing my eyes shut and then open.  The chaos is maddening.  I know not where I am now.  Further back off this path, the roadside prophets told me I was in hell, yet no devils taunt me here.  I sit alone now beneath this burnt tree.  Silence… Maybe I’m the only one who made it.  Why did no one else run, but instead just stood there mesmerized in trance?    I should have listened more carefully for those musical horns.

      It is that point in the morning when everyone is getting up and beginning their days, scurrying like mice along sidewalks with their extra-large coffees in hand (starbucks double machiatto or latte if you’re trendy).    The only place I have scurried this morning has been straight to my house and into the darkness of my bedroom.  Old friend got in from out of town last night – hadn’t seen her in a few months..  She doesn’t seem to have changed that much… actually not at all.  At the party I went to after dinner at a jazz club, I ingested more than I should have in way too short a period of time. When I stood up all dizzy and needing some fresh air I found a ghost from my past standing in the doorway blocking me from passing.  I wish I had known he was going to be in town,  I wish I could have prepared myself.  People do not forget.  They hold onto to the smallest moments as though the biggest scars, using them solely as a crutch for all they think and feel.  A crutch will never be a foundation, but don’t try telling them that.  It started with sarcasm, with following at my heels and pulling at the arm and hem of my dress.  Then it escalated to me cornered in the dimness and him pushing against me calling me names with a snarl, being cruel about past incidents and slamming people I care about.  What his jealousy drives him to do and say has always me a bit uncomfortable. We were never intimate, only good friends who may have shared a couple of moments while way too fuct up, but nothing serious.  Maybe if we had slept together, he wouldn’t be haunted by something he will never have had and things would not be this way now. I don’t know…  My flight reflexes kicked in full effect and I came home early a mess, angry, sad, lonely… Spoke briefly with a friend who helped as much as he was capable of.  Unfortunately he was not able to take away the noise in my head.  So I went back out, looking to further my numbness with someone I barely know, who I don’t have to reveal things to, she is fun to get messed up with.  That’s where I’ve been until now.  But I am left a sleepless skeptic, thinking that men only want me when I am honest about my not wanting them.  The “challenge” – which is so cliché it makes me want to scream and has been way too familiar a situation in the past months. What I have wanted and what I am capable of have not been in sync with one another for a long, long time.  Sleep is nowhere in sight. I am not going back out into the world today…

      Late at night on some of the movie stations they play porn.  I’m not talking soft-core local station late night Baby Blue shit… porn.  Completely graphic oral sex, fucking, anal, double penetration, extreme close-ups of all parts ramming other parts, incestual relationships – they show it all.  This leaves me completely stumped because the porn on these cable stations (family stations that show Finding Nemo only an hour earlier) are rated “R” with a disclaimer for “explicit sexuality”.  How can that be?  What differentiates these movies from the porn sold on the top shelf of your local convenience store which supposedly have an “X” rating????  It certainly isn’t the acting because that is pretty much the same all across the board.   After being driven absolutely crazy with my not understanding and several nights watching this movie station “R” rated porn, examining and dissecting it as though it were an experiment in 11th grade biology – I have come to only one conclusion as to what makes an “R” suddenly turn into an “X” : the cumshot.  It’s all about the cumshot, so I am now convinced.  That is the ONLY thing they are not showing on these cable tv porn movies.  At least the only thing as far as I can tell, and I’m not really sure how much more of the cable porn I can take trying to find out or understand.  I’ve looked around on the web, checked the different rating boards websites and have found only the following in reference to “R” rated sexuality: Nudity: Full frontal nudity in a sexual situation. Sexual Activity: Simulated sexual activity; limited instances of brief, non-violent explicit sexual activity.  First, there is nothing simulated on the cable porn. Second, there is nothing limited or brief about the sexual activity being shown.  Now for a slight further twist… apparently there is no actual “X” rating as a part of the MPAA, which I didn’t know.  This was apparently a rating created to indicate a film that was going to be made and distributed (or whatever) without the MPAA’s involvment.  As well, supposedly the term “XXX” was created by the adult film industry to simply indicate that the film would show close-ups of the “private parts”. The MPAA has since created the rating of NC-17 for legitimate films which involve adult content, but mention them mostly being foreign or artsy – or something like that so I got.  So where am I left with all of this now?  Uhhh… porn is porn, ratings don’t matter to anyone except over-protective parents who want to shield their children instead of educate them, people are going to fuck whether approved by the MPAA or not, and what it all appears to come down to is… dum da da dum: the cumshot.  Speaking from a woman’s point of view, I’m not at all surprised that this seems to be the focus of where the line is crossed.  It’s ALWAYS about the cumshot, no? hehehehe

      This morning’s thoughts lay in decisions made while intoxicated.  Unclear at this point if alcohol makes me do things I just simply would not do under different circumstances, or if it allows room for already present feelings and thoughts to be brought up to the surface and easily pushed forth.  Possible regret was knocking down my door with the sun at about 8:00 this morning.  In my extrememly inebriated state last night, I made a split second decision to send my friend a letter I had written a few nights ago.  I obsessively write letters to people that will never get sent, I suppose just as a form of venting, to get things or thoughts I’m having off my chest and out there into the universe without actually having to deal with any possibility of confrontation or consequence.  I’m not sure why I caved on this one and sent it to him.  It was not one of those filled with weapons to induce anger and hurt… just extremely personal little ponderings regarding him.  Normally, not a big deal – except that we don’t speak to each other in those ways anymore, that was a part of our past and a place I distinctly recall us deciding months ago that we did not wish to return to.    I’m almost sure that it was in reference to me and my letter when he wrote much later that a friend had shown him a side of herself which although was known, had been forgotten.  I’m not sure how this makes me feel.  Sad that it was ever forgotten, both by him and myself.  Thankful that it has been remembered and not lost completely.  Disappointed in myself that I ever decided it should be locked away inside and no longer shared with him.  The things we do out of fear of discovery…  The things we fear out of the habit of rejection…  I fear the consequences and childish embarrassment which will arise from this today will be more sobering than the hangover I am currently experiencing.

      the man on the subway gently reaches down and brushes a finger across my leg giving me goosebumps i shiver and look up at his chisled face see the smirk playing on his lips as he continues to move and is now touching himself beneath his briefcase the motion of his arm pulsing slowly back and forth the same movement as the train penetrating its tunnels i should get off at the next stop but perhaps i'll stay on just awhile longer

      I feel out of sorts today, and I’m not sure why.  Did not party too much, so that can’t be it.  My sleep was restless and I woke at 6am for no apparent reason.  I grabbed my dog and went out walking – it’s strange living in an actual neighborhood with houses and trees and parks.  Too used to living on major streets, I guess.  Even though I am only five mins out of the downtown core, it’s a completely different world.   So I walked and walked, got to this park and saw a bench beside this little river and under a tree.  I went and sat with my dog there.  Out of nowhere I just started crying.  I held my head in my hands and bawled like a child.  I don’t think there is any specific one reason why.  I’ve been tripping over memories all over the place lately.  It’s like they just leap up from the street and grab me by the ankle making me fall flat on my face.  Reminders are everywhere I turn my eyes.  And there seems to be no consolation – well if there is, I haven’t found it yet.  A old woman came up me to on the bench and called me “dear”.  She put a hand on my shaking shoulder.  I was torn between my urge to turn to her in desperation and my urge to run, afraid of contact with another human being, afraid that I don’t deserve her compassion or empathy.  I saw the kindness in her light blue eyes, her concern.  I felt like she could see right through me.    I got up and walked away.

      I am afraid of my lack of feelings and the consistant loss of what ones remain. I have difficulty distinguishing the difference between intuition and hope, moving on and running away, starting over and erasing, letting go and denial, kindness and ulterior motives…  I try to kill so much away and once success is achieved I mourn its loss like that of a child.  I place myself in seriously fuct up situations in vain attempts to try to make myself feel something, anything – just some proof that there is feeling.    I am not completely dead inside, I just fear I can’t care the way I once did or the way I should – the way everyone else seeme to be capable of.  Is this what happens with age and experience? At what point do fear and defence fall away becoming wisdom?  I look at so much and can’t quite grasp how it really is, only how it should be in my mind’s eye.    I want to see the rawness in everything.

      So another night has come and gone, sleepless yet again.  The routine of tossing and turning while haunted by my mind's queries and misconceptions is becoming a ritual all too familiar these months passed.  I looked around me at this awfully pretentious cocktail party - all the women in their trendy little dresses, the men in mod 50's tapered suits.  Nothing was familiar.  Nothing ever seems familiar anymore.  And it's strange because there is a feeling of safety and security found in this.  I realized so clearly in those moments that most of the people in my life are simply nothing more than fillers, things to take up space and provide amusement in passing the time.  I divulge nothing to them except what I choose - only what seems to satisfy their curiousity in whom they would most prefer me to be and that which serves my purposes for getting what I want.  I have to ask myself honestly: if it came down to it, would I actually give a shit about any of them or be there if they really needed me to?  Honestly? No.  Not sure why, or when I crossed the lines in life where I became so detached.  Or more importantly, when I became so content with things being this way.    Once again, I reiterate: I find safety in my detachments. I smile, I look pretty, I do the drugs that are offerred, and then I go home (maybe alone, maybe not), and wonder what the consequences of my night will be the next morning.  I am suffering some of those consequences right now in my sleeplessness and from indulging perhaps a little bit too much. I think I should probably call someone whom is close to me, someone I do actually care about… that maybe I should talk to them and pour out my thoughts.  But I know I won’t.

      tiny droplets of sweat cling to his brow as i tear my shirt away and he runs a calloused finger under the strap of my red lace bra but pulls away and asks me to leave it on as he lays on the bed while i remain upright there in front of him he just stares drinking in my body making a comment about the way my jeans hug my hips he says the slight curve of my stomach is perfect the contour of my breasts against the lace flawless as though i had been molded by a great sculpter who revered the woman form and then firmly states that i am one of the most divine creatures he's ever laid eyes on i have never felt more naked

      I was up really early this morning because I had an appointment to get to. As I came out from my appointment and was standing on the corner waiting for the light to change I suddenly felt someone firmly pinch my ass. I whipped around with a full fist ready to completely pummel whoever the shitbag was that did this, especially considering it wasn't even noon yet. Another man who was standing at the corner grabbed the ass-pincher hard and looked like he was also going to start in on him too. After a few seconds of looking at the guy I started to recognize something about him. Then his girlfriend stepped up smiling, saying hello, giving me a hug and telling me that she put him up to it.   I had met this couple back in November at this huge porn/fetish party that was going on because of the sex show convention. I had spent that night and next morning chilling with them. Both work in the porn industry, and are cool as fuck. I hadn't seen them since then and now I run into them at Yonge and St.Clair at 11am on a Wednesday morning. They immediately decided that they were taking me to lunch at this really nice cafe. Now this is a couple whose relationship doesn't make me uncomfortable, they are definitely made for each other and seem very much in love - the kind which comes from being completely comfortable with the other person and leaving all fears and insecurities behind. So we sat, ate, drank wine and they told me of their plans which are currently in progress for starting up a new big distribution house based out of Toronto. They told me about all of the funding and support they have and told me (upon hearing of my current miserable corporate working situation) that they would love it if I would come and work for them. Especially with my background in finance and admin. They said I was just "so damned cute" they would love to have me around all the time. It wouldn't be for a few months yet but they gave me an estimated salary amount and I was impressed. Who knows, maybe it won't happen and they were bullshitting. But then again, maybe it will. It would be fun, I would get to receive all the perks of working in the porn industry and never have to put out.  After lunch we headed back to the new house they just bought together in Rosedale. Fucking gorgeous. Huge, beautiful, pool, hottub... If I thought their last place was really nice, this blows it way out of the water. And it's decorated so beautifully. I don't know the details about these guys or what, and all, they specifically do but whatever it is is definitely bringing them some nice cash, even if they have been saving for years which they must have been in order to even put a down payment on a house like this. I wonder if their pretentious stuckup rich family money neighbors know that they're living next to people who fuck for a living on film (although I get the distinct feeling they possibly do more than that whether fetish or something else).  They're having a big party at their place this weekend, another 'industry' shindig. We exchanged numbers and they told me that I had to come. I don't know if I'm up for that, the last one although really fucking cool with good people ,was pretty uhhh well, interesting... yeah, that's it. But who knows, it's tempting and that's for sure. And I have a friend who would definitely come with me. But I've already got a lot of fucked up friends, do I want to start delving into the porn industry looking for acquaintances there? I mean the novelty of it will wear off soon enough and that's a huge part of it regardless how nice the people are - they live on a different fucking planet than I do. That might be a scene that would be wise if I kept distance from, not saying I would start making porn or anything but there's a lot of people, these two friends as a BIG example, who have lots of cash and believe in sharing for free whatever substances may fall into their laps. Hmmm... Fuck it, who knows. I'll deal with it when the day comes. But this afternoon was still fun as all hell and these two are still wicked people.

      Relationships are fucked up. This is what I realized again tonight. I seem to avoid them as though they were the bubonic plague but often under the illusion that I am perfectly and completely fine.   Chilled with a friend of mine and her boyfriend tonight. Haven't hung out with them outside of a loud and busy atmosphere in quite some time - they should not be together. They bicker, not in a cute picking on each other kind of way but in more of a fashion that causes you, as a spectator, to be really uncomfortable. It makes you want to scratch and tear your skin off in a plea for them to just fucking stop already. They search for things to argue about and are constantly, or so it seems, looking for little things to use as weapons against one another which would specifically cause a new argument to begin. But will they walk away? Doesn't look like it's going to happen any time soon. Having said that, it also doesn't look like I'll be chilling with them outside of a party again any time soon either. Why put yourself though that? Why would any of us do that? But we do. I've been there and even I can't give a good reason for why I stayed. Maybe I'm just at the point now where I have no patience left for bullshit.   I recently saw another friend of mine too. She was really upset and I felt bad because things just went  way  too sour with a guy she was seeing awhile ago and drama is on its way back in. And because somewhere along the way I became a fucking hardass, I feel even worse because I doubt I can offer anything to make her feel better (which she was basically specifically asking for), anything out of my mouth would be bashing, pessimistic and cold. All I can do is keep my mouth shut and nod. At times like that I keep hearing the same phrases repeating over and over in my mind: "You've reached the voicemail of 'Divine Irony', I am currently out of the office or away from my desk and therefore cannot offer assistance at this time. Please leave a brief message and I will get back to you as soon as I can. Thank you and have a nice day..." or "This subscriber is currently not available to accept your call, please try again later." I'm serious, these phrases literally go through my mind. How bad is that?   With my friend tonight I tried a couple of comfort words which I'm sure came across with no conviction because she looked at me dead center in the eyes, she had been refusing to make eye contact with me before this point because I'm sure she was afraid of falling apart completely, and with tears hissed, " He fucked me over.  You , of all people,  you  know that he fucked me over so bad ." I haven't seen or heard that much anger, hatred or pain from anyone in a very long time - the last time was probably myself. Damn. I had absolutely nothing to say to that because it was 100% true. It was a pretty fucking intense moment, as ones with the most raw of emotions usually are.  Now this has brought emotions up in myself that I had conveniently tucked away. Fears I refused to acknowledge. Pain brought back to the surface. Confirmations of why relationships are too often bad news and why the prospect of them makes me extremely uncomfortable. I remembered that I never want to feel the way she is feeling again. Never. The skeptic I am now battles constantly with the hopeless romantic that I have grown up being. For every good thought or hope about love I may have, it is quickly counteracted with a thought of doubt and coldness which I conclude is me "just seeing the reality of the situation". I take notice often of my own defenses when they kick in and I admit, I rarely do anything to stop them. The second I may begin to feel, or the minute someone does something that I could possibly twist or turn to interpret as them pulling back or us heading down a road which could ultimately lead to the possibility of my being hurt, I get angry and bitchy and more cold than ever towards that person. I don't trust people and I don't believe them and I always think how unfair it is of me to demand from men that they prove themselves to the point that I will trust them. When I ended things with the last guy I was seeing he said, "I haven't done shit to you. All the other men who have been in your life hurt you and now I'm the one who has to pay the price for that." Those words hit me pretty hard and rang very true, but it didn't make me stay with him. I think I've been this way for years only piggy-backing on other people blaming them for all of my personal dysfunctions so I wouldn't have to take responsibility. Wow. Have I ever been wrong. All I can do right now is sit here shaking my head confused and introspective. And with all these thoughts I find I am asking myself, in addition, if I believe in fate any longer. Or what about karma? I don't know how it all relates to anything anymore. Hmh.

      Ok. I just found a website that has left me completely unsettled. I checked it out and what happened kinda freaked me out a bit. So I backed out of the page. Then I went back again because I was too curious and the damn chicken was still there in the same position. I am feeling pretty disturbed and confused by this. Go check out the  urlLink subservient chicken . Do it now.  Damn. That's just fucked up.

      Tonight Pride weekend is over. Thank god. I didn't even participate in very many of the festivities, but simply having lots of friends and a room-mate who did was exhausting enough. I woke the other morning to a strange pair of men's shoes in our front hall... This morning I woke up to two strange pairs of men's shoes in the front hall. Luckily this morning's shoes were of a mutual friend who had just crashed here, well not so lucky for my room-mate.  This weekend I have concluded that apparently there is a massive shortage of fruit flies in the gay community. I say this because I swear that my phone was ringing off the hook with everyone who is gay who I ever met in my life calling me to go party with them. I'm confident in that I know I can be a fun person, but I got the distinct feeling that they were looking for me to fulfill the specific role of the "token fruit fly".  Let me explain in case someone is unaware. There are  fag hags  in the community, these are women who associate with gay men whom they are attracted to and have the goal/dream/hope somewhere inside that they will one day sleep with their fags. A  fruit fly  at no point has any desire to sleep with her fags and is often disgusted at the thought of this, she is just one who hovers around the fruit. I am obviously the latter. However seeing as there appears to be a shortage, this is simply wearing me the fuck out. I just cannot be everyone's fruit fly. There is only so much fruit I can hover around at any given point in time. And this is especially so at Pride when every gay man is looking to have his "token fruit fly" hanging off his arm.   Otherwise, I once again turned to my trusty television the other night in hopes it would aid in boring me to sleep. Flipping through the digital guide I saw a discussion type program called 'Sex, Toys and Chocolate'. Of course with a title like that I am going to turn to it immediately with curiosity completely peaked. It was just coming off of a commercial break and there were six people, who had never met before the show, paired off into man/woman couples. They were going to have a friendly competition with one another to decide who was the best at giving fake oral sex. The women had to take on bananas (of course) with whipped cream, the men had to do their thing with half a pitted papaya also with whipped cream.  Holy Fuck . They were getting so crude with their respective fruits I couldn't believe it was on cable. It was making me blush - which is saying something because I don't very easily, and I was laughing so hard I had tears in my eyes. I'm not going to give details, I'm sure you can imagine what was occurring all on your own. That was my straight person moment of the past 48 hours. My friend who was watching it with me was traumatized by the events. Hehehehe  I also found out something else that is interesting. According to an article published in a Toronto newspaper for Pride week, all gay men can essentially be fit into six categories. The article makes it seem, in my opinion, that there is no middle ground. If you are gay, you are one of these. How ridiculous is that? I am going to make an equally ridiculous list for straight men, straight women, and lesbians noting the categories and then I will have everyone in this world completely figured out and stuffed neatly away according to their sexual preferences. I mean, the only thing that dictates who you are is in those preferences, right? (Bullshit)It will come later...

      Thanks to  urlLink Sophistikated Nonsense  I just tried a supposed Color Quiz personality test thing. The results were pretty bang on and included statements such as:  ~Seeks independence and freedom from any restriction and therefore avoids obligations or anything which might prove hampering. She is being subjected to considerable pressure and wants to escape from it so that she can obtain what she needs.  ~Relationships rarely measure up to her high emotional expectations and her need to be made the center of things, leading to disappointment . Always has mental reservations and tends to remain emotionally isolated and unattached. Exacting in her emotional demands and very particular in her choice of partner. The desire for emotional independence prevents any depth of involvement.   ~Preoccupied with things of an intensely exciting nature, whether erotically stimulating or otherwise. Wants to be regarded as an exciting and interesting personality with an altogether charming and impressive influence on others.  ~The tensions induced by trying to cope with conditions which are really beyond her capabilities, or her reserves of strength.  ~She attempts to remedy this by intense activity and by insistence on getting her own way. Faulty self-control can lead to ungovernable displays of anger.    I'm wondering what the deal is and how this page actually calculates the results. I'd be interested in knowing if anyone else got similar results, or if different, exactly how accurate/inaccurate they seemed to be...

      I can't believe it's only Saturday, I feel like it should be pushing on Monday right now.   I got a call from a friend at like two in the morning on Thursday night telling me that I had to drag my ass out of bed because they were having a last minute "slumber party" and were coming to pick me up. I was in no mood to do this but went anyways. The "sleepovers" which they have every so often and always on short notice, simply involve a few of us sitting around their loft in our pajamas (which is the strict dress code) having a few drinks and indulging while having what is usually really good conversation and listening to good music. But there is never any slumber or sleep. Their place is like a bloody black hole that just sucks you in. I was there for way too fucking long.  When I finally emerged I came home and had a quick nap before starting the process of getting ready to go back out for drinks and then to this jazz club "Top O' The Senator" since it was day one of the Toronto Jazz Festival. I try to hit these clubs as often as I can (and have been especially itching for it these past few days) but it's difficult because not that many people I know are really into jazz - they want the thumping bass of a club, the loudness of a live band or the bop of 80's retro, all of which I  appreciate greatly but it's not the same. There's just something about jazz... sitting there in some darkened room with the musicians up on stage just jamming and you can tell exactly how much they're into it. Another thing I enjoy about jazz clubs is that most often the only people that are there are those which have a really big appreciation for the music - most won't go to some dank club to listen to some guy go completely off on a saxophone because it's trendy or to pick up women, at least that's what I've found. So... you find yourself among musicians that are getting off to their own music and surrounded by others who are getting off on it too - hence an entire area of people doing nothing but getting off to music, no bullshit politics.   So I get all dressed up for a pretentious night out and go to this martini bar in Yorkville for a few cocktails and then down to the club with a friend. Playing was The Chris Potter Quartet - this guy has skills. Crazy, crazy, crazy on the saxophone. Damn. It was good. Afterwards I was not too drunk and feeling very musically fulfilled so I came home an extremely content girl. In the cab on the way back to my house I get a phone call from my very drunken room-mate who had spent the evening running about Church St. in the gaybourhood for the first real day of the Pride festivities. Slurring something awful he told me he was also on his way home so I had to stay up and wait for him which left me a bit irritated because I really just wanted to go to bed. A little while later he stumbles through the door and throws a little bag at me saying he had a pill that we had to do. I was surprised because my room-mate doesn't usually have these kinds of things but I was extremely pleased. When I'm really tired the only things that I will stay up for, or wake up for if I'm already asleep, that will not make me bitter and angry are sex or drugs. He slammed down smashed on our couch and I picked up the bag. If I thought I had been happy before at the concept of pills, I was absolutely delighted to find that it was no pill at all but a bag of coke. As my teeth began to numb I decided that this was definitely something worth staying up for, and my room-mate was forgiven.  I was somehow able to pull off a couple of hours of shit sleep tossing and turning as is usually the case when doing coke. But those few hours are better than no hours and I feel surprisingly good considering the lack of rest and amount of abuse/drinking I have done in the past few days.   And it's only Saturday. This is going to be a long weekend and I have too much shit to do above and beyond partying. But this week being the jazz festival has definitely helped in making my spirits rise.

      Met a friend whom I had ceased associating with a little while ago for a coffee today. To put it mildly - our friendship had become  complicated . But their reasons for wanting to meet with me seemed very urgent and important. Keyword being "seemed".  After sitting down they wasted no time before informing me that they felt it was getting close to the point in my life where they needed to stage an intervention. What???? An intervention they replied to my obvious question. Of course I had to ask exactly what needed to be intervened. This is as close to the list as I can make of reasons they gave me of why apparently someone should be intervening in my life:  1)You abuse, abuse, abuse. (No shit. Me? Abuse? What a ridiculous thought. I abused when I met them - that's how I met them, I abuse now, I will abuse in the future. No change except for a couple of substances that were experimented with at one point - and guess who made the introductions?)  2)You are an emotional masochist. (Well, they were my friend for a long time so that proves there must be some truth in that.)  3)You are an emotional sadist. (Ok, there was that one time that I was a complete bitch to them and it made me feel pretty good. No, I won't lie, several times - but they were well deserved. And they need to get their shit straight - am I a masochist or a sadist? Which is it? Their response was that I am one because I am the other. Hehehe. I asked if this had anything to do with my unwillingness to explore BDSM tendencies with them - I got a very stern look.)  4)You are withdrawn. (Ok, just because I withdraw from one person does not mean that I am "withdrawn" - well, maybe from their perspective.)  Around this point in the conversation they were not being very appreciative of my sarcasm, my giggling or my responses. So the following points may not have been part of the original list they had but could be based purely on how aggravated I was making them.  5)You have become a fucking C&%T! (I agree completely and had nothing to say about this one.)  6)You manipulate men and then throw them away when you have no use for them anymore. (Ok, this is interesting. Sure they have seen me go through a few, but isn't it great when your relationships suddenly get turned upside down because someone has gotten out a thesaurus and decides to change some words around? This is what that sentence should have been if someone hadn't been so angry and trying to hurt me: You try it with men and seem to have the bad luck of it not working, and so when you realize this you calmly end it and walk away which sometimes unfortunately does hurt the man. Quite possibly this person could have a personal anger issue with me because I never even attempted a relationship with them before I walked away.)  7)You have become a fucking C&%T! (Yep. So apparently their creativity dwindled at this point because they went back to calling me names. I laughed at this and got a red faced stare of pure hatred.)  So.... apparently my life needs intervening for no good reason at all. Except maybe that this person would like to intervene on the decision I made not to associate with them anymore. Which after this conversation I would have to say was probably a wise choice on my part.   Big pats on the back for me. I chuckled all the way home.

      I recently discovered through  urlLink this  website another site which is actually pretty entertaining. I've included it my links "Dumb Laws". Essentially it's got the most ridiculous laws from all over the world. As I said: entertaining. Hehehehe...

      So this weekend is Pride. I'm being completely bombarded, and I mean  bombarded , with emails and phone calls from everyone getting excited, making plans and announcing parties to compliment the festivities.   The only word that can describe how I feel about Pride this year is "meh". It just isn't holding the same excitement for me as it has in previous years. Essentially I feel like if you've been to one, you've been to them all. Same drunkenness in public, same beer tents, same dj's playing the same music at stages set up in the same places they are every year, and I'm the same token "fruit fly" hovering around all my little fruits.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all about supporting Pride and what it stands for and I always have fun... I don't know, I'm just not feelin' it this year. Maybe I'll feel differently after I get a few drinks in me. The leather daddy bears still scare me though in their chaps. The drag queens scare my room-mate, but I like 'em. Most big butch dykes scare me and make me feel like a little girl they want to take advantage of. Some of my friends have a booth this year selling stickers with dirty slogans they  sat around coming up with over a period of a couple months all messed up.  My one friend who is a balloon artist is making a huge penis sculpture thing out of balloons to set up at the booth as well, that will definitely draw some attention.  Ah well. Meh.

      Reading over my last several posts I think I'm coming to terms with the fact that I can be quite a hostile, angry, sad, opinionated, pessimistic person. So... in order to try to offset these posts, I have decided to write down happy thoughts. Kind of like a hate list in reverse.  These are things that are pleasing me very much right now:  -Strawberry cheesecake ice cream (it makes me purrrr like a kitten)  - Portobello mushroom soy burgers (with a bit of chevre on top and some garlic mayo, mmmmmmmmm)  -My favorite body lotion which is made of ground cocoa butter, vanilla, yogurt, and banana (plus other stuff that I can't pronouce but the smell and texture are what is important)  -Chocolate syrup. I rediscovered it with the ice cream the other day and now I want to put it on everything.  -The happy little pills I received as a gift from a friend which make me sleepy and very relaxed. I like these ones...  -The girl who lives in the basement bachelor apartment of my house. She's really nice but even better is that her boyfriend works for some alcohol distributor so she is always getting free bottles of booze and bringing them up to us. She is very much appreciated in our home.  -My hand-rolled sandalwood incense which has proven itself most effective against offensive skunk smells.  -The customer service rep at the cable company who I spoke with today. She was so fucking nice and helpful. I had to speak with her supervisor just to give her a commendation. There should be way more like her.  -T-Rex. I just can't get enough of these guys. As I mentioned to a friend of mine before: heroin addicts who were no doubt unable to have sex so they just made lots of music about it. Makes you feel dirty.  -Matthew Dear. The album "Backstroke", once again has been pretty regular in my rotation the past few weeks. Specifically the track "Good Girl".  -My morning glories. My room-mate planted them for me on a sad day when we moved in, they are growing like mad and climbing up everything. I love vines.  -Puffy the cat, yes his name is Puffy. I have never been a cat person, but this cat has turned me into a big softy. I am putty in his paws. He is the best cat ever and he loves me and my dog.   -Klimt. I just got yet  another  big book of his art from this used and rare book store down the street. Too fucking beautiful.  -Finally: I am  extremely  pleased that my good friend is moving back to Toronto in a few days. I have missed them terribly over the past while and I can't fucking wait to see them again. At which point I will (try to) stop blaming them for everything and just start being happy that they're back home. They deserve to be spoiled.

      I was recently browsing a Douglas Coupland fansite and re-discovered an article that I have the original of somewhere still. I forgot how much it entertained me and how good he is, so I felt the need to share. I tried to find a link everywhere straight to this article but came up empty-handed, so here it is:   Generation X'd   You were born in the 60s. Does that mean you'll have to pay for it the rest of your life?   Details, June 1995    Five years ago, when I was twenty eight, I wrote a book called Generation X. It was about three strangers who decided to pull back from society and move to the fringe of Palm Springs, California, where they worked at dreary jobs at the bottom of the food chain. Together, they spent time trying to relocate their individual identities inside a new psychic landscape where personal memory fights for real estate with commercial memories. As they searched for meaning, all three sensed that their withdrawal was an act of sanity rather than negation; their worldview was simulataneously ironic and sentimental, and it reflected a way of thinking I had never before seen documented.  The book's title came not from Billy Idol's band, as many supposed, but from the final chapter of a funny sociological book on American class structure titled Class, by Paul Fussell. In his final chapter, Fussell named an "X" category of people who wanted to hop off the merry-go-round of status, money, and social climbing that so often frames modern existence. The citizens of X had much in common with my own socially disengaged characters; hence the title. The book's title also allowed Claire, Andy, and Dag to remain enigmatic individuals while at the same time making them feel a part of the larger whole.  Generation X's tiny, March 1991 printing had no publicity, and received almost no reviews. But that summer a Texan my age named Richard Linklater released the movie "Slacker", which was filled with overeducated and underoccupied oddballs who loosely paralleled the characters in my book. And in Seattle, a new form of music was exploding. Its attitude had everything to do with withdrawal, contemplation, and seeking the margins - albeit with the volume knob cranked to eleven. As the media goes, two's nothing, but three's a trend. Thus were born the most abused buzzwords of the early 90s: "generation X", "slacker", and "grunge".  The problems started when trendmeisters everywhere began isolating small elements of my characters' lives - their offhand way of handling problems or their questioning of the status quo - and blew them up to represent an entire generation. Part of this misrepresentation emanated from the baby boomers, who, feeling pummeled by the recession and embarrassed by their own compromised 60s values, began transferring their collective darkness onto the group threatening to take their spotlight. The result? Xers were labeled monsters. Their protestations became "whining"; being mellow became "slacking"; and the struggle to find themselves became "apathy". Once I understood this boomer angst-transference, their criticism took on its own twisted logic and instantly became benign.  Then the marketing began. Urban Outfitters. Those Bud ads where people rehash 60s TV sitcoms. Flavapalooza. Irony, which most young people use in order to make ludicrous situations palatable, was for the first time used as a selling tool. This demographic pornography was probably what young people resented most about the whole X explosion. I mean, sure, other fringe movements of the past - the 20s expats in Paris, the 50s Beats, 60s Hippies, 70s Punks - all got marketed in the end, but X got hypermarketed right from the start, which was harsh.  Around this time my phone started ringing with corporations offering from $10,000 and up to talk on the subject of How to Sell to Generation X. I said no. (The Gap asked me to do an ad. It was tempting, but I politely refused.) In late 1991, after both political parties had called to purchase advice on X, I basically withdrew from the whole tinny discourse.  And now I'm here to say that X is over. I'd like to declare a moratorium on all the noise, because the notion that there now exists a different generation - X, Y, K, whatever - is no longer debatable. Kurt Cobain's in heaven, "Slacker"'s at Blockbuster, and the media refers to anyone aged thirteen to thirty-nine as Xers. Which is only further proof that marketers and journalists never understood that X is a term that defines not a chronological age but a way of looking at the world.  Now that we are relieved of the X burden, what to do? Well, it's still a good policy to continue defying labels: Once people think they've pigeonholed you, they'll also think they can exploit and use you. (I know of what I speak.) Refuse to participate in all generational debates. As for the marketing exploitation, a good thing about the X sensibility is that it's always a few steps ahead of the media game. Marketers have known that to pump money out of baby boomers, all they need do is play a Beach Boys song and show a clip from Vietnam. With X, they naively continue to assume that any generation actively enjoys participating in its own selling out. Wrong. Let X = X.  One would think that boomers, coming of age in the 60s, would be thrilled to see the notion of individualism adapting itself to a changing world. Instead, all they see are monsters. Andy Warhol once said that he liked sci-fi movies where the monster lays an egg at the end because it guarantees a sequel. Well, my three characters didn't lay eggs at the end of Generation X, but maybe other eggs were laid instead. I'm thinking of millions of monster eggs out there sometime in the future, all hatching small, slimy, horned babies crawling toward some form of truth, tirelessly, en masse, waging war against the forces of dumbness.  So please, be a monster.  -Douglas Coupland

      I have been trying to avoid this kind of post, however a recent onslaught of emails has finally driven me out of silence.   Now I don't consider myself a political tycoon or anything, especially when it comes to Canadian politics which I know is ridiculous because I live here. I have taken more time to educate myself on international affairs. However how can I not take notice of what is occurring in my backyard when the federal elections are coming up fast and the Conservative party are in too close of a lead with the Liberals? Especially when they have Stephen Harper as their leader? There are so many things that are wrong with this man and others in his party. There are too many things that he stands for that hit too close to home and he has made his intentions clear in the past even though they may not be included in his current campaign. Maybe I'm just an ignorant fuck but it appears to be worse than previous years even though I know he's always stood for these things, or maybe it's just that more people are listening to him now and I'm noticing more clearly the strong effect this kind of federal leadership would have on myself and the people who are in my life.  First, I want to address his stance on abortions. Now I understand how people can have mixed feelings about this and I'm not here to start an argument on the right and wrongs of this procedure. However, I do believe that it is a choice that people should have the right to make and that no government should be able to take that choice away. I believe that Stephen Harper would push for this, despite his stance at this point that he has no intention of changing any legislation and will not discuss the subject during an election campaign. I mean what kind of retaliation can he make against the Liberals accusations when he knows that they are right?   Secondly, Stephen Harper and his would-be cabinets position on gay and lesbian rights. Once again, strongly opposed.  urlLink Here  is a website that goes into depth on this subject. Here are some scary points which are brought up by this organization regarding these issues:  -Stephen Harper has dismissed sexual orientation as a "behavior" and said he does not even recognize us as groups protected by the Charter. -His candidates have described sexual orientation as "deviant", "unnatural", "repulsive" and as encompassing pedophilia. -Stockwell Day ("God, as a God of love, warns us about things that can be detrimental to us. One of those things is sodomy") is the Conservative Foreign Affairs Critic. In two weeks, Stockwell Day could be Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs. -Myron Thompson ("I want the whole world to know that I do not condone homosexuals. ... I think it is unnatural and I think it is totally immoral")is the Conservative Assistant Justice Critic.  In two weeks, he could be Canada's Minister of Justice.  These kinds of things, the limitation of our rights within our own countries on too many levels begins to occur when religion is allowed into parliament. It's obvious. I believe that as a government it should be those representative's GOALS at all times to remain   objective  . They have to, I mean no one county is going to have all residents believing in the same things. We all need equal voices and representation. This is common sense. Religion should be left to those in the Church. They can fight  what is happening in our world that goes against the word of Christ or whatever. They can assume the responsibility for converting all of the heathens. As has been said by a million different people on a million different occasions: Religion has absolutely no place in politics.  I'm not saying that Paul Martin and his Liberals are shining examples of a great leadership because I have my own opinions on that which I will not go into here. I just cannot fathom living in a society where my rights are infringed upon by those who govern us not with objectivity but with their own religious beliefs. What century are we in again? What year is this?  This is all so ridiculous. This is why I don't talk politics. Or religion for that matter.

      A skunk just blew up outside my house. Possibly quite literally. I heard a really strange noise before it happened as a car was driving by, I'm not sure if maybe one got hit or what. I can't see any roadkill from my bedroom window. Maybe it just felt threatened by one of the bright orange pylons from the construction. Something made one discharge it's most foul odor onto or near our premises so that it was seeping through my window (which is no longer open). The sandalwood is now burning in an attempt to exorcise the smell from the vicinity of my bedroom.  This little episode led me to wondering exactly what the fuck is the purpose of a skunk? I mean, I realize not much in this world has any kind of purpose, but why skunks???? Did someone somewhere make a slip-up in creation and this was what we got? Or was it yet another clever joke by my Lord Of Crack that I have still not discovered the punch-line to? I decided some research into this was necessary.  Some interesting yet useless skunk trivia:  -The striped skunk's scientific name comes from a Latin word meaning "poisonous vapor". -Striped skunks do not use their spray on each other, even in the fiercest fight. -The only predator that appears to be immune to the effects of a skunks spray is the great horned owl, which hunts the striped skunk at night. -Skunks are resistant to snake venom. They can survive ten times the amount of venom needed to kill another animal of similar size. -The striped skunk has been protected under the Environmental Conservation Law since the late 1800s. Perhaps the value of skunk musk to the perfume industry, combined with the commercial use of their pelts, caused early legislators to give skunks special consideration.   Yep. That's about all I found regarding these smelly little fuckers. Apparently they have no purpose except to terrorize innocent neighborhoods with their offensive smells.   DISCLAIMER :    Despite the tone which may be perceived in this post regarding the furry little striped skunk, no harm was caused to any animal as a result of the smell which was secreted so rudely on my premises this evening. And despite the apparent uselessness that this animal seems to possess I will not dispute it's right to be here. We as humans are pretty useless too I guess. Bluntly: if it pisses me off, I can write whatever the hell I want about it and cannot be held responsible for anyone who may take offense. This is a blog, it should be offensive at times.

      I am in a mildly hostile mood with lots of excess energy for no good reason. Who's fault is it anyways? There must be a good scapegoat somewhere...  Blame it on the government, the conservatives especially.  Blame it on the cats howling this morning.  Blame it on the ugly construction workers who were loud and then proceeded to yell stupid comments at me when I walked to the store.   Blame it on the people who fulfill stereotypes and are so cliche that it makes me want to throw the biggest temper tantrum this neighborhood has ever seen.  Blame it on the sun which has been teasing me all day and pays no attention to the sunscreen I put on but burns and browns me anyways.  Blame it on the sunscreen for not being stronger.  Blame it on the horrid woman at the store who bought out the entire make-up counter and has hair so big and sprayed stiff that I can almost guarantee there are a few dead animals hidden somewhere in there.  Blame it on the black star, just cause Radiohead says so.  Blame it on the obscene amount of drinking, coke and pills I did this past weekend.  Blame it on the movie I saw when I was way too young that showed some woman whacked out of her tree on "angel dust" and made me run and tell my parents that I wanted to do lots of "angel dust" when I grew up just because it sounded so pretty. (Enter making of a junkie here)  Blame it on the cigarettes that I am not smoking... again.  Blame it on the gum that I have to chew and feel disgusted by just to keep me from smoking.  Blame it on the coffee that I have been drinking pots of all day just to keep me from napping.  Blame it on my room-mate who put a stupid song in my head this morning that I have not been able to get out of my thoughts all day.  Blame that stupid artist for ever making that stupid song.  Blame it on Bush, just cause it's trendy and I can.  Blame it on my friend (you know who you are) just cause it's easy and in the end they're who I usually blame for everything anyways.  Fuck it.

      I am tired, confused, and cranky.  It started around 5:30am. The most awful fucking noises coming from outside. I don't know if it was cats in heat or cats getting ready to fight. It was loud, it went on forever, and it was like the dead were rising straight from hell. Said noises then made the cat in my house curious and start pacing and getting concerned - on my head. It was bad. And I couldn't stop any of it.  I thought it was all over. Then at 8am I woke to what sounded like the world falling apart outside my house. Street construction. Drilling, banging, yelling, digging, chain saws revving, trucks clanking. I thought for sure that the dead which had risen earlier in the morning were certainly wreaking their havoc on my neighborhood and taking over.  Then it seemed to have stopped. I was mistaken. It is still going. It is loud. I am awake. I am confused. The construction men are old and ugly so there is no consolation I can give myself when I look outside to their mass destruction of my street.  I yawn. Then I "Grrr".

      There was the Depression, the Prohibition, Martin Luther King, the Vietnam War, the hippies, disco, punk, anarchy, the ravers with new ideology of peace, love and oneness... What does our generation mean to us now? At woodstock 1994 a member from House of Pain was quoted as saying, "They say this is Generation X. I say it's Generation Fuck You." Are we now nothing more than a generation of doubt?  Looking around, people are brimming with energy. They have vision, emotion, feeling - but seem to have no idea where to channel this. We are all driven, yearning with a divine hunger for something better than what we've been given. A hunger festering within us because we want to change the world. But where do we exercise this? How can we put it to use?  There is no unity as a whole, there is only unity as individual groups. And we use this to divide ourselves, to fight against one another. We are separate entities fighting to prove who is hurting more and who deserves more. How can we even begin to think about saving anything in this world when it has become painfully apparent that the most important thing is to save ourselves? We are raised in this niche, we are bred to feel sorry for ourselves, to look and dwell on our personal misfortunes. It is not a cause that brings us together, an upheaval of one thing - it is our pain and suffering that we relate to and that attracts us to others who feel just as sorry for themselves, who are just as angry, who are just as hostile.  But then... There are those of us who appear to feel nothing. Which is better: the raw passionate anger or the emptiness? We wander as hollow shells not quite angry, not quite hopeful, just not quite sure. We may have those moments of seeming clarity but they never last. Why should we feel things? Why should we initiate any kind of change which would require us to go beyond the comfortable safety zones which we've worked so hard to build around us? Especially when we can ease our consciences so easily. Donate your "less than the cost of a coffee a day" monies to an orphaned child in South Africa. Turn on the television and watch the war, when it starts to get under our skin we can just change the channel. We have gotten much to comfortable with what ease it takes to  look away .  To say that we have become a generation of fear, that which drives both the anger and aggression as well as the silence and timidity, appears much too easy and broad a categorization. We don't seem quite sure what to feel at any given moment. We have become drones in our uncertainty, depression looming all the larger with our feelings of emptiness and not having a purpose or roll to fulfill. We look around to corporate logos to drown ourselves in, or maybe even ignore them altogether passing everything by without even raising our heads to take the chance that in one moment we just may find that one thing to believe in. That one thing that will for once make us certain and allow us to raise ourselves out of this generation of doubt and follow in so many of our predessors footsteps into a generation with meaning where we are all leaning towards something...

      Dear Lord of Crack,  Although I have never contacted you before, you may know me as one of your most faithful subjects since my early youth. I feel that it is high time we bridge the gap and you receive your due credit.  I am very grateful for your having chosen to come in and become a major ruler in my world, and I give you many thanks every day. I recall fondly early moments in my childhood when I began to notice a "change" in my way of thinking - however at the time I didn't recognize it as being from your influence. I began to receive strange looks from other people and could almost hear them thinking, "That girl is not right".  But before I knew it I was worshipping you all the time whether yelling nonsense at strangers on the street or staying up for two days straight writing a crazy thesis on how we all have doozers in our heads (which by the way was probably one of my more brilliant moments, thank you for the initial brain fart which instigated that thought).  Oh how I adore you, kooky Crack King. I know that there have been times when you have caused me concern, when being different and accepting the title of "crackhead" has been difficult, when I cursed at you thinking I had been abandoned with my many momentary relapses with the horrible God Of Common Sense And Straight Thinking (no thanks to being a corporate yuppie) but I hope that in the end I have done you proud.  And so, in closing, I make this promise to you: I promise to always live by the code you have set to be silly, speak nonsense, consistently challenge Common Sense And Straight Thinking, (the horrible demon), to find the crack in every moment (much like this one) and proudly embrace the very essence of being a crackhead.  -Your loyal and sleep deprived follower of the Way.

      It's my room-mate's birthday today so yesterday we had something of a party to help bring in his 25th year. Originally it was just going to be a small afternoon gathering with only a few friends having some cocktails in the sun. I'm not sure why I even attempt to try to make any kind of a plan on a smaller scale because it never fails to end up completely opposite. I know no such thing as moderation. This should have especially been expected when I got the "gleam" in my eye on Friday and while half in the bag already, decided it was a great idea for me to make an obscene amount of jello shooters for Saturday afternoon. As the past has proven (several, several times over): jello shooters = BIG trouble.  Where initially only a few friends of my room-mate's were coming, I decided that if we were going to be doing this it should at least be done half-right and could be a great excuse for me to invite some of my friends by to check out the new house. Friends who inspire me to get into the most trouble humanly possible. Drinking began early which led to memory fading well before dinner time. Memory came back mildly at some point when I fell face first into a snowbank, don't recall what time or many events though and memory as well as brain went back on vacation quickly for the rest of the night as the drinking and other badness continued. Finally, somehow I came to while chilling in the later part of this morning.   Today I feel like death. Computer has remained off, phone off, no visitors, even the dimmest light and low volume of the television hurt. Mostly I just stayed in the dark of my bedroom with a completely blank slate for a mind, curled up in the fetal position and staring at nothingness unable to sleep. I don't even want to know what happened or anything I may have done last night, and I firmly made this known to my room-mate first thing today. However, lots of pictures were taken which I'm sure will embarrass the fuck out of me and all my room-mate did tell me was that I went at the shooters pretty hard early on and sat being loud and obnoxious eating tray after tray. That's a lot of alcohol consumed and in no way included the other drinks I was having.  Having rambled uselessly about this, I only have the following random crap left to share in my brain-dead state of the current moment: Chill on the drinking. Chill on the drugs. Things need to be less accessible to me. I may be starting to feel a bit of concern about the amount of shit I can consume without immediate damage. Nah. I hate recovery periods. I hate consequences. I need a hug. Cats are good and make you feel better when you're paying the price of fun. Completely losing just under 24 hours to a blackout is confusing. Everyone is getting old. At parties when too many people get too messed up strange things happen such as chairs being placed randomly throughout the backyard in strange positions, socks in my freezer that do not belong to anyone in this household, balloons in the freezer (quite possibly from my girl who is a balloon artist,but this hasn't been confirmed)...  I need sleep.

      Maybe I had a really shitty sleep haunted by bad and disturbing dreams. Maybe it's early in the day for me to have started drinking. Maybe I'm just adding fuel to the already belligerent and vile mood I am in. Maybe, just maybe, I'm fucking pissed off.  As much as I love it when people surprise me with good things about themselves and prove me wrong about ways I had already considered them being - it really fucking irritates me when they prove me right about negative behaviors or qualities they have. Moreso when I have given them a chance.  I hate being lied to. I hate being misled. I hate being treated one way and then the second someone is presented with a chance to turn and resort back to old bad patterns of behavior, they do. I hate being told "Trust me" when the person knows inside that they don't deserve it and really would never hold up to that if it came down it. And the best is when they try to rationalize their dishonesty saying they did it because they care and didn't want to hurt you. And almost give off an air as though you are being ungrateful. Of course, finding out they lied, which is inevitable, is going to feel so much better.  Part of my anger obviously also resorts back to myself, and my stupidity at allowing certain people in my life, of giving them that chance, of going against my better judgment in what I know will eventually happen in the end, of not listening to what people told me about someone as with their more objective views they know before it already started exactly where it was heading and going to end up.  Bullshit.  I haven't felt anger like this in a long, long while. You know the kind where it's pumping through your veins like you did a whole bunch of speed. You get up, pace back and forth, sit down, look around, kick something across the room, let out a loud string of the most harsh and vile words you can muster up, swear repeatedly over and over, clench your fists, get up, pace around some more... just all this energy, your anger taking on actual physical form. And you have no idea where to direct it. Yep, that's about me right now. That's the reason for this post spitting venom in hopes that it chills me the fuck out.  I was right. I was right. I was right. I was right all along. I fucking dare you world, to try to prove me wrong about someone just once.  I fucking dare you .  Too many people have no decency and no respect. I'm not sure what it is about my nature but people I know have the worst time ever being honest with me. I see people being honest with one another all over the place, it seems like a common enough occurrence... but never with me. They will turn, they will run, they will spit lies that they know I will never believe, create mass chaos when I find out and then simply just shrug their shoulders not wanting to deal with consequences. I'm thinking long and really fucking hard right now back over people whom I have been close with in the past and I can't think of one, yes you heard me, ONE who was ever completely straight up with me. Bullshit. Bullshit. Bullshit.   I fucking hate being lied to. I fucking hate being misled.  And all because someone is fucked up and doesn't have the courage to be straight up with me.  Although only instigated by one individual, everyone in my life is currently walking on a  very  thin line with me right now....

      My mother used to love music. When I was really young, before she married my step-father, she used to play on her guitar or play records and I used to dance around. Sometimes she would dance with me, others she would just sing while I danced in pretty little girl dresses with long blond curls. There were three songs in particular that she used to love I think because I distinctly remember her playing them over and over again. These songs became my early childhood:   Landslide - Fleetwood Mac ,  Rhiannon-Fleetwood Mac ,  Sister Goldenhair-America . I think I knew every word to them before I could even formulate thoughts clearly.   My mother no longer loves music, she has blocked it from her life. Once in awhile when I was a teenager I remember I would catch her digging through boxes of old records and staring at their covers lost in memories. But she never played them, just stared at the pictures and ran her hands over the black vinyl.   I wrote down in an old journal something my mother told me once: "I used to know you. I helped form who you are. Now I'm afraid I don't know anything. Where I once felt wise, I now feel like nothing more than an old crone. All I can do is hope for the best and try to trust that you'll be ok. I hope every day that someday the restlessness in you will calm and you will finally find what you're looking for."

        Young in New Orleans         starving there, sitting around the bars, and at night walking the streets for hours, the moonlight always seemed fake to me, maybe it was, and in the French Quarter I watched the horses and buggies going by, everybody sitting high in the open carriages, the black driver, and in back the man and the woman, usually young and always white. and I was always white. and hardly charmed by the  world. New Orleans was a place to hide. I could piss away my life, unmolested. except for the rats. the rats in my dark small room very much resented sharing it with me. they were large and fearless and stared at me with eyes that spoke  an unblinking death.  women were beyond me. they saw something depraved. there was one waitress a little older than I, she rather smiled, lingered when she brought my coffee.  that was plenty for  me, that was enough.  there was something about that city, though it didn't let me feel guilty that I had no feeling for the things so many others needed. it let me alone.  sitting up in my bed the llights out, hearing the outside sounds, lifting my cheap bottle of wine, letting the warmth of the grape enter me as I heard the rats  moving about the room, I preferred them to humans.  being lost, being crazy maybe is not so bad if you can be that way undisturbed.  New Orleans gave me that. nobody ever called my name.  no telephone, no car, no job, no anything.  me and the  rats and my youth, one time, that time I knew even through the nothingness, it was a  celebration of something not to do but only know.    -Charles Bukowski

      I just came across a post on another blog that made me feel really sad. Not sad like I want to cry, but shaking my head "That's too fucking bad" kind of sad. It was posing questions about women having sex and the status of "easy" being placed on them for this.  This is a subject I feel very strongly about, not necessarily for the same reasons as the girl who wrote the post, but for my own personal reasons. Maybe because I was raised in a strict Catholic environment and an equally strict household where sex was taboo and women just didn't do certain things. If you, as a woman, had certain thoughts or feelings you were essentially damned and made to feel awful because those feelings were completely abnormal and wrong for a woman to have. It just wasn't "proper". Or the correct feminine etiquette.  So many stigmas follow women around regarding sex. I am not necessarily speaking of what society would have her labeled as, but rather what she is reared to believe about herself and her sexuality. Too often a woman is made to feel uncomfortable in her own skin.  She limits what she wants by what she feels she should do. De-programming what is embedded in us from birth is a long and trying process that many women fail at.  What I speak of has nothing to do with a certain type of woman who has low self-confidence and sleeps around with whomever presents themselves to her in order to try to make herself feel better and just be close to another person - anyone. I'm not talking about the woman who has little to no self-respect. I'm not talking about the type of woman who consistently confuses sex with love. I speak of a woman who is afraid to enjoy sex. Who is afraid to seek pleasure from casual one night stands with someone whom she is attracted to. Who fears her own sexuality and fears expressing it.  We are all animals. We have instincts. Seeking pleasure in whatever form is not a bad thing and I curse at systems of belief (religious or otherwise) who would have us think so, and would have us say "no" when everything in us wants to say "yes". Who would have us apologize for who we are and what we do. Who would have us fear our own sexuality and fear being labeled as "whores" because we indulge in an act that is completely natural with someone whom we may not be in love with. Who tell us to "suppress" when we should really "express".  I curse at them all...

      I recently read some article about an agressive type of fishing called "Monkeyfishing". Apparently you use some kind of doodad  in the water and it sends out an electrical current which in turn stuns the fish in the river and sends them floating to the top of the water... allowing the "monkeyfisherman" to easily bend down and scoop them out. Yep... apparently it's all in a day's work. So what if it's illigal, it's just one more way in which people can exercise their laziness (yes I know, it's an oxymoron).    I'm not sure what kind of an area this electrical current covers. But lets say I sit in a boat for 12 hours in an area which is fairly populated by fish. On a regular day if I did this, in that period of time I would catch about 8 fish by normal rod and hook methods. Now, if I spent that time doing nothing except sitting there, reading, gettting drunk, whatever... and at the end of my 12 hours put the zapper in the water, sent out my currents and collected 8 fish. Doesn't it all work out in the end? Since it apparenty only stuns them, if more fish were stunned once it wore off could they not go on their merry swimming ways again?  But reading further along in this article, apparently the local authoritites in Florida used to have tons of fun in chasing down the monkeyfishermen and it was "a great thrill". Because there was a boat chase, people used to consider it "sporting". Then it became a felony and now the poor law enforcement in those parts of Florida just don't know what to do with themselves.   And probably the best part of all: how this "agressive" fishing got its name... Supposedly because the first monkeyfishing devices had a handle you had to crank just like that of an organ grinder on the street corner wih this monkey.  My good god. Where do those kinds of associations develop from, really???? I mean, the first thing I think of when I see a crank being turned is one of those organ guys with pet monkeys. But I bet I will now...  This is what I learned today.

      I was having a bit of a tough go of things later on last night. Nothing in particular happened, it was just raining and I was feeling lonely and kind of sad.  When I'm feeling the familiar "pang" I will turn to someone and I will get pep talks, or be thrown a long list of options of what I can do to make things better, or get told everything that I am doing wrong, or a step-by-step plan created for me on what I need to do in order to resolve whatever is ailing me. Those make me angry. But how can you get angry at someone who just cares about you and is trying to help. People automatically assume that when someone is down and approaches them, that this is what they are asking for: help. More often I am not. All I want is comfort, to not feel so damned alone, and to know that my feeling a certain way is ok.   I think because of this I keep so much bottled up inside, I get weary of turning to people and them going into "let's clean up her life" mode. Sometimes I am weak, and in those moments I need to be weak and know that it's ok if I am. I don't want solutions, I want a hug. I am not something to be fixed, I don't need anyone to carry me on their shoulders, just maybe someone to lean on every once and a while.  After a pretty failed attempt of conversation about these things with my room-mate, who I'm not sure if I've mentioned before, is one of my best friends in the world. Well, he tends to get a bit protective over me and wants to charge and bulldoze right over everything and everyone who may be causing me grief. It is in his nature to take that control and want to make it better, by force if necessary. I guess it's in my nature too. And I love him for that, but he just kept missing the point completely.  So, I turned to another friend and wrote him this awful rambling email that probably didn't make a whole lot of sense, but I think got the general point across. Someone who I am close with but who's sarcasm and unwillingness to listen to anything I have said in the past has kept me from revealing too much about myself in these kinds of moments. He's more of a "this is what you have to do, just do it, stop bitching, and feel better" kind of person, like it's all so simple and everything is the easiest in the world and I'm an idiot for not realizing it sooner.  So, I wrote him a letter anyways and his response was so simple it was fucking perfect and made me feel so much better than he probably realizes. There were no lectures, no quick fixes, no condescending attitudes or sarcasm. Just a sweet little blip that let me know he was my friend and a silly memory of something that I had completely forgotten about which made me smile. I really don't think people realize how much those little things that seem totally unrelated mean to someone like me. And the fact that this friend wrote knowing, or at least hoping, that it was what would help, shows me that maybe someone out there really does know a side of me. And that makes me feel not so alone on those kind of days.  Thank you friend.

      And so the beginning of summer continues… I fucking love it. Spent the majority of the afternoon on Sunday tossing and turning in bed wired and trying to will myself asleep – unsuccessfully. Then just before dinner time I got a call from a friend, a few people were taking off to a cottage for a couple of days to soak up the sun and just party. As much as I love the summer, I love spontaneity more, so of course I accepted and barely had time to pack a bag before my dog and I were off on the drive to cottage country.  I haven’t gone up that way since I moved back to Toronto 2 ½ years ago. It is too beautiful.   When my friend and I pulled up to the cottage everyone else was already there, a perfect number of hedonists (6 of us in total) let loose in the wild with no sleep and on the first cottage trip of the year.  Pure debauchery. It was fabulous.  Nibble food was already prepared, the liquor was flowing, and before I could even drop my bag I had two huge lines cut out for me and was handed a pill.  You gotta love it when people do all the thinking for you.    It rained for awhile during the night while we were sitting outside. I think we were all too giddy to be away from the city so we started dancing and screwing around in the downpour. We ran into the lake and went swimming; floating in ice cold water, hot humid air, cool rain – the contrasts in feelings was incredible. I know I’ve spoken before about my being an intensity junkie and always wanting all of my senses heightened to the max – well this was it. I could feel every square inch of my skin alive with cool rain pouring over it in the humid evening. It wasn’t just that I was drunk or a mess (although I’m sure that aided) it was the whole thing, that perfect moment when I could have burst with absolute happiness and feeling like things just couldn’t be any better.    Somehow I managed to pull off about two hours of sleep, for which I am extremely grateful. Before getting back into it all I also managed to eat something a bit more substantial than snacks and while having a coffee experienced something else I haven’t in a long time: a sunrise. At least a minimum of once a week I can guarantee that I am up while the sun rises, but never do I actually sit in the quiet and just watch it. I guess that being in the city and doing that isn’t anywhere near the same as being in middle of nowhere woods unless I were to go to the waterfront, but even then… So I sat down by the dock with one of the others whom I had never met until this weekend and we just drank coffee, started breaking out lines,  watching the sunrise and having wicked and silly conversations about all sorts of shit. They got kind of tripped out at point because of how much my eyes looked like the sky... I miss connecting with people, no matter how long I’ve known them or how close they are they still seem a million years away to me. The difference between people who are wicked to party with and you always have a great time, and those that fulfill the above requirements but are still so much more. It was probably all just within the events surrounding the weekend, and we’ll probably never see each other again, but I kind of prefer it that way. I’d hate for it to be ruined with all the bullshit from the real world.  Today was an amazing day outside again, and although I have been trying adamantly to keep my skin from browning it inevitably happened, reddened even. A couple of the others went swimming again but the lake was still a bit too cold for my liking, so I just ran in and then right back out. The drive back was quiet but really comfortable. I was still pretty out of it, and the others were all in separate cars and going back to a mutual friends place to continue on with the partying, but I declined and just got dropped off at home. I don’t want to push my luck with this weekend and how great it’s been. There’s a  time when you have to start dealing with the inevitable. And I know that this is only the beginning of summer… there are many more weekends left which hole infinite possibilities for perfect moments. Damn though… I definitely need to go up to that cottage again. Too much fun.

      There was a man with a very large hammer. Not quite a sledgehammer, but huge nonetheless. He would strut arrogantly around the work site with it a dangling weight off his toolbelt. Many people were impressed by this and he got several offers for jobs as people assumed he was definitely a professional in this field to own a tool such as that.  However, what slowly became apparent through his work was that no matter how carefully or diligently he went at any task, he could not hit a nail with that hammer for the life of him. There is much that stands as evidence of his mishaps. Walls would get smashed in creating huge holes, many planks of wood splintered and broke, many home projects demolished... all by his hand and that hammer. But of every wall, wood panel and project the one thing which remained untouched was the nail - the sole purpose for which the hammer's existence was based, the goal which he was trying to reach.  Now remaining seemingly unnoticed throughout the rise of this man with his hammer, stood another man. This man also had a hammer although its size was quite small compared to the other. This man would walk throughout the work site exuding a calm confidence that no one could place, with his smaller hammer snuggled neatly away in his belt.   What after much time it became apparent to all the people was that this man could take on any task and perform it completely and expertly. One swift stoke and whatever nail was standing strong, easily and smoothly descended into its destination. Every time. There were no messes, no broken pieces, no projects that would go unfinished, no angry clients - just perfection. Slowly the people began to realize the abilities this man had with his hammer and he became the most sought after work man in the whole community. And never, at no point, did the people have to worry about any nail being missed again.     The moral of this story is:   It's not the size of the hammer that counts, it's how you swing it.

      Yesterday was the most near perfect day I have had in a really long time. It was gorgeous outside, not too hot, with a great breeze. We spent the afternoon drinking in our backyard in the sun. Then we had a great bbq for dinner and kept on with the drinking well into the evening. Following this I went to a retro club which is normally a wicked time but last night was exceptionally fun. Lots of great music, lots of great people.  Then, we hit another club that deals more with house and shit. Once again: good people, half decent music, loads of fun.  Went to a friends place afterwards and was there until later on this morning.  Nothing special happened throughout the course of the day and night, everyone was just in the best of moods and smiling and laughing with no bullshit to be found. Even though we kept on going and going it still felt completely relaxed and chill. Although there was an incident with a guy who was too messed up and thought it would be a great idea to strip and run naked through the party at my friend's... Besides that (actually let's include that because it was a good chuckle) it was just a great fucking day overall. With summer coming on fast and strong I hope there are many more days like that.  Now you’d think that I’d feel satisfied and happy with the course of events, in a way fulfilled even. But being the selfish demanding little bitch that I feel like I am right now, I felt like I still wanted more. Not sure what of, but some things were missing.  I mean, of course it would be too much for me to simply accept all of the wonderful things about yesterday… Instead I nod my head at them with a smile and then turn inwards asking for more and thinking about people and things that could have made it even better.  Do we ever stop wanting more? Wanting it all? Wanting to change great moments into “perfect” moments? I doubt it. Today, with no sleep yet and rain pouring down outside, I think I'll just curl up in my bed and selfishly keep wishing away for all the things and people that are not with me right now.  On a completely different subject: I had a conversation with someone awhile ago and at one point they were describing a moment of intimacy. I love it when people surprise me. When you think you have someone pegged (not even consciously thinking it) and then they say something unexpected that throws you and makes you take a step back saying, “Wow”. My friend did this in our conversation. It goes hand in hand with someone finding beauty in things and places that seem so ordinary (which I’ve spoken about in a previous post). Finding how a woman arches her back during sex, or the curve of an arm, or the shape of her collarbone, the slight movement of a leg… these do not seem to me to be typical things which a man would find erotic. With my friend holding an opportunity to be cliché and lewd (which I expected to be snatched up without a second thought) I was taken back when they didn’t focus on the regular parts of a woman which are given the most attention when sexually speaking such as their breasts or ass or whatever…  And instead of describing the actual “act” of sex in a blunt and shameless way, they described the actions which were a result of the pleasure received from sex. It got me to thinking that maybe there are more men out there than I realize who revere and worship the woman form in its entirety, who are not stereotypical in only wanting "T&A" and that maybe they just aren’t admitting it but keeping it a quiet secret for themselves so as not to concern the rest of the male gender or seem any less to their friends.  As a woman myself, I think that this makes us a lot less like meat. It was such a great surprise when I heard them speak in such a way, such a great surprise indeed. And it even made me respect them a little bit more, which I know may sound strange, but it just did. I walked away from that conversation feeling pretty good about this person being my friend and feeling not so hopeless about men. Hmm…

      There is a girl who works at a Blockbuster by my house. I went in there today to buy a movie and she served me. Now, I know what good customer service is but you can go overboard and just be plain creepy. She was making a huge spectacle out of serving me (as she did everyone before me and I'm sure everyone after). At first I was stunned, then I got angry because I thought she was being a sarcastic little bitch, then I got worried that maybe today was her day to snap and lose her shit because she had been a Blockbuster employee for too long, then I got defensive, and then finally I just got really fucking confused. She was loud, TOO happy, saying catch phrases from different films where she could, waving her arms all over the place... She practically yelled to me, "And this has to be back NEVER" and then proceeded with a crazy fish-hooked smile saying, "You have a nice day!!!". Then as I walked away I noticed her taking a moment of quiet time and humming before turning and beginning again for the next customer. This girl is scary. She makes me want to run out of there and once I hit the sidewalk just keep on running all the way home. She has served my room-mate before too and also scared him, and he is not too easily scared. Maybe I'll start going to the Rogers store where I won't be afraid of an employee going ape-shit because they can't handle their job.  On another note: my Bundy family neighbors are insane and, as I can imagine usually comes along with insanity, extremely inconsiderate. They are tearing up the walkway between our houses that leads to both our yards. Neither our landlord nor us were notified of this. So I was woken up way too early this morning thinking that something awful was going on because my entire house was shaking. They were fucking jack-hammering away all of the cement and going in along the line of the foundation of our house. All day that jack-hammer went, all day my house shook and shook. Now they have all the broken cement pieces and dirt piled along the sidewalk in front of our houses, all their trash cans and recycle bins piled on our lawn, and our walkway completely blocked off. After feeling bitter about all of this I've decided to come up with a couple plans of how piss them off:  -put poo in the miniature farm house mailboxes that we love so much -put all the pieces of broken cement together flat like a jigsaw puzzle covering their front lawn as a present for them in the morning -every night my room-mates and I take turns running and peeing on the same spots on their front lawn so eventually they would have little yellow doodles in the grass of their "perfect" lawn  I know there are a million more but I'm too tired and drunk to think of them right now. Maybe I should just let my landlord  (who absolutely hates my neighbors) take care of it... but how much fun is that for me? Besides, I'm the one suffering psychological trauma from having to see that tacky woman in next to no clothes every day so it only seems fair.

      spoken word at a beatnik bar I found after shots of vodka at my russian restaurant I could never read anything of mine I’m too afraid and not that good at sharing there was a man all bearded and grey and looking like he hadn’t slept in about ten years his voice was gravelly just the way I like it so that when I close my eyes the words pour over me and through me taking stabs at the appropriate wounds and bringing the beauty of so much forgotten back up to surface where it never should have left but at least it’s been found now and I remembered that I have loved which I suppose is better than nothing one of his pieces had the music of a piano behind it I felt like I could have been out of an image gained from a Tom Waits song that crazy barroom balladeer I wish sometimes I were a man because men can get away with being drunks and assholes so much better than women but maybe that’s just an illusion because I don’t think there are many women who I admire I prefer the old drunks and addicts how sad is that I just find them more honest and raw and HONEST about life and feelings than so many others and although through their boozing and whoring they may be trying to hide in their writing and music it all comes out and they strip away at the flesh that is so inconviently put around us but I suppose in the end is really necessary and as I left the bar I flipped the middle finger to them all and they smiled  hmh.

      I recently reread a short story by Dostoevsky entitled: The Dream Of A Ridiculous Man. It is about a man who is about to kill himself because he feels nothing anymore, but on the night he plans to do so he falls asleep with gun in hand and has a dream. In his dream he finds himself in a perfect world where there is nothing but harmony among all people. There is no war, no poverty, no unhappiness at all, and he cannot comprehend any of it. He begins to question it all to the people and describes the world he lives in, describes greed and power and riches. Slowly but surely they begin to fight among themselves and eventually this perfect world becomes exactly as our own. And in the moment that he looks around and realizes what he has created, he makes the comment with much irony: "...and so I corrupted them all."  That story, for some reason, has always given me a good chuckle.  Now I'm wondering how many people have I corrupted through the years? And how many more do I have yet to corrupt? That's a scary thought. Especially considering that I was never the person to be pressured into anything growing up, I was always the one who had to try and do everything first and then get everyone else to try it. Is it wrong that I get some kind of perverse pleasure out of running into someone I used to associate with years ago and knowing that I had some part in shattering a belief or method that they held close?  But at the same time, I console myself and rationalize it by thinking that those beliefs or behaviors couldn't have been too solid for them or it would have been more difficult for me to break through - they wouldn't have fell "victim" quite so easily. Hehehe  I think you can also on some level tell how easily influenced certain people are when you meet them. Someone who is completely stubborn and won't budge takes way more effort than someone who is talking big but has no ground or conviction in what they say. Now don't misinterpret me as being some completely manipulative bitch, because I don't think I am... but when I come across individuals who seem to be sending out some kind of cosmic subconscious signal about wanting to change or be tempted but are seemingly too unsure or afraid to do so, why should I not challenge that? Fuck, I've been challenged enough through the years, that's for sure. And I thank all those who have done so, you who have tempted and corrupted me should certainly be proud.

       Random memory of the day #2:    I was 16. I had just moved out of my parents house and was staying with my friend and his older brother at their place while their parents were gone away to Florida for the winter months. It was a crazy split level house furnished with all top of the line posh things. The TV was probably the biggest I've ever seen and stood taller than me. We used to get really cooked and play Sonic the Hedgehog on it and he was the size of a child. The couches in the family room were white leather and your face stuck to them while you slept. The fireplace was chrome and white tiled with a wide cushioned sitting bench along the bottom of it, also white.  I walked in one cold evening after having gotten into a huge arguement with some guy I was seeing. The room was a haze of smoke. A smell I was unfamiliar with hung in the air mixed with the scent of weed. One of our friends was sitting on the white tiled floor with a dish towel wrapped around his neck humming the Superman theme song quietly. My friend was sitting on a chair rolling another joint. His girlfriend was seated in a corner drawing. His brother was hunched over in front of the blazing fireplace. I went and sat down on one of the couches. The song "Sweet Jane" by Velvet Underground was playing. I watched my friend's brother as he continued dazed in ritual. That was the first time I ever saw anyone prepare and shoot heroin. Just before he put the needle to his vein he looked up at me with the strangest expression on his face and "Fade Into You" by Mazzy Star began to play.  That was my introduction to those two artists, and their music will forever be tainted despite how much I love them. Not necessarily in a bad way, but I can never hear them and not think of the expression on his face, even if only for a split second.  Later that same night in the hot tub is when I first fell in love with Leonard Cohen's work. My friend's brother had just told me the story of how his wife had kicked him out the previous month and taken his children away. My friend came downstairs to the hot tub and said excitedly that he had just found what he had been looking for all night and read the following:  "I heard of a man Who says words so beautifully That if he only speaks their name Women give themselves to him.  If I am dumb beside your body While silence blossoms like tumors on our lips It is because I hear a man climb stairs And clear his throat outside our door." -Leonard Cohen  Those friends are in pretty bad places now so I hear. But I am thankful to them for much which came from that night.

      Late last night I was just chilling going through old CD's with a friend of mine. I asked him to pick something, whatever would make the mood for that moment. What he chose pleased me so much because I hadn't listened to it in so long: Ween - Pure Guava. I go through so much music so quickly, always looking for and craving something new that will assault my senses. But in doing this, I always end up forgetting about older shit that I loved and that would definitely play a major role in the soundtrack of my life. Pure Guava is definitely one of those. I suppose I kind of enjoy the surprise and re-discovery of some music more than if I had remembered it consciously all along. Especially when it happens at the most perfect moment. So my friend and I sat there til the sun was coming up going through older music (lots of Ween) smoking weed in my harem/opium den themed living room with incense and candles burning taking one of the most severe trips down memory lane that I've had in awhile. I still get crazy goosebumps and shivers from The Stallion Pt. 3. And I also remembered how much I love just having crazy listening sessions with someone who's a good friend and enjoys music as much as I do. I need to chill and do this kind of thing more often, it was such a great time.  My most distinct memory of Ween, specifically Pure Guava, is from about 10/11 years ago at my friends house while his parents were gone away. Three of us decided to drop a whole bunch of acid and just trip out. That's the same night I first discovered the Yellow Submarine cartoon. After watching it and feeling all young and happy, I discovered my friend whose house we were at wasn't around. I wandered upstairs in a daze and found that all the lights were out. I could make out a figure laying on the carpeted floor - my friend. I sat in this rocking chair, just moving back and forth, confused and unsure about what was going on. He whispered to me in a hiss, "Listen.." Suddenly the track Mourning Glory blared full blast from the speakers. It fucked with me so bad, and became known by me as the "Devil Song" because it sounded sooo evil. I ran downstairs back to the safety of my Yellow Submarine-land. I still have issues listening to that track now...  But, I've had a lot of really fucking great memories to Ween too. I guess it's that way with everything. I was just so excited and have been stuck down memory lane ever since. I'm sure there will be more rambles about useless memories later - today is just that kind of day.

      Ah this weekend, this weekend...  I think I have come to the conclusion that I am completely exhausted. Exhausted of always being on the go. Exhausted of random connections with people who mean nothing to me. Exhausted of trying to make everything mean more than it actually does. Exhausted of getting hopes up in what I think may be a moment of clarity, only to have them crashing down in what was nothing ever more than a fog. Exhausted of not being comfortable enough to sit quietly with own thoughts. Exhausted of trying to fight against the fact that nothing makes sense. Exhausted of using others and being used by them. Exhausted of being hurt and hurting others equally. Exhausted by my doubts and inability to trust the people I do care about. Exhausted of not caring the way I feel I should.  I seem too easlily caught in these non-stop cycles of intensity.  It's like I am a junkie anxiously awaiting the next time an intense moment comes and hits me in the vein.  I fear that unless all senses are heightened to their maximum that every moment will be exactly as the one before. I use this intensity for proof of feeling.  I fear without it I will be nothing more than a drone going through motions in a world I do not find beautiful on its own.  I long for quiet, but once I taste it I feel bitter and untrusting and skeptical.  I miss the people who are close to me today. Even though they could be in the next room or 600 miles away, their distance feels the same.  Genuiness seems like an old myth: I'm sure I've come across it before, but have not witnessed it in too long to be sure. Today I want to feel it. I want to lay down here on my bed and be cocooned by those whom I care about and feel, really feel and truly believe what they say and do.  I do not know anyone's roles in my life anymore. I'm not even sure of my own.  I am just too fucking exhausted. And this sappy sentimental post has already gone on too long.

      The recovery from my little wine extravaganza the other night was long and trying. Shopping and lunch with my friend was an experience I NEVER want to have a repeat of. Apparently what I am capable of tolerating on a normal day, I am not able to hungover. But the cat seemed to be in rougher shape than I was from his playtime with the catnip, so I didn’t feel so bad.  It is fucking gorgeous out today. I spent the day walking around outside and hitting antique and home décor stores.  After four hours out in the sun  I decided that a trip to the liquor store was definitely in order. And of course, I once again fell victim to the good ole’ chardonnay. We’ll see what happens with that tonight, I have a feeling that my getting into trouble is already unavoidable. It is one of my girlfriend’s birthdays and there is a party going on to celebrate.  The house that the party is at is fucking gorgeous and the host is a complete sweetheart. My over-indulging seems inevitable. I’ve been trying to keep on the straight path for a little while, but it is her birthday and she’s a good friend. Ideally, however, I will stop by, have a few glasses of wine and then exit as promptly as I arrived to come and get a good night’s sleep mostly sober.  The actual odds of this happening are next to none.  On another note: it is day 2 of my quit smoking attempt. I’m not craving the cigarettes as much as I thought I would now that they are forbidden to me, what I am having the most difficulty with is the fidgeting and I realize now exactly how much the simple “act” of smoking is a comfort to me. I need to find something to keep me busy and my mind off of them. I’ve been chewing that damn gum which I have got to say is the most AWFUL tasting shit I have had to endure in awhile. If my will isn’t enough to get me to quit, then the taste of chewing nicotine will certainly do the trick. After a piece I am feeling too nautious and disgusted to even worry about wanting a cigarette for some while afterwards.    Also nervous about tonight for reasons having nothing to do with the party because I really fucking hate having to answer for things that I have done which probably haven’t been the nicest, or at the least were extremely misunderstood… Today is definitely a GRRR of a day.

      While out and about yesterday I grabbed a couple bottles of wine so that when I got home I could have a few glasses to complete my "relaxing" evening. I had adamantly refused several offers to go out because I wanted to "relax" and get good sober sleep. HA! The next thing I knew I had polished of the 1.5 L myself (except for one glass my room-mate had)and was starting in on the second bottle. It was somewhere around this point that things become fuzzy and started to go downhill.  However, what I do faintly recall is just no good.   I got my friend's cat who I am currently taking care of completely whacked off catnip, and he was crazier than I have ever seen him before (might have had something to do with the fact that I just gave him the whole plant in its pot instead of just a little bit). I know there was something regarding me standing on the sidewalk in front of my house yelling my room-mate's name and then when he looked out his window I flashed him and mooned him... several times. According to my phone log there were a few lengthy conversations with friends, I can only imagine what was said. I found evidence this morning in the form of an open dialogue box of a conversation that took place over MSN messenger. Reading over it I can confidently say that I am embarrassed. And within this conversation there is mention of an email which I apparently sent that could have contained nothing but more bad news leading to yet further embarrassment.  I woke up a little while ago and am trying to drink down a coffee. The bottle of advil and package of gravol are very close at hand. And I have to leave here in 1/2 an hour to meet a girlfriend of mine who is always way too chipper and loud so that we can go curtain shopping and do lunch at a Thai restaurant (that should be fun). This is going to be a painful day. And for that I blame the semillon chardonnay.

      Ok, so I was walking down the street a little while ago and had quite a strange experience. Listening to my minidisc, the track "The Long Way" by Superpitcher came on. It's got this beat that I don't have the brain power to even try to explain right now, but it started with that. I looked at the woman walking ahead of me and noticed that she was in perfect synch with the beat of this track. Then looking up and scanning my surroundings I slowly began to notice that everything - every bounce of the cars, every step by people, the playing of the children, the bobbing of the birds - all of it was matching the beat perfectly. Then about halfway through the track or so everything around me went back to normal. It kinda freaked me out and made me wonder if maybe I haven't done too many drugs over the years. But it just seemed that in those few moments the world took on a time of its own and created this syncrhonistic pattern where everything moved together in one easy and continuous motion.   Kinda reminded me of things explained in the books I was reading awhile ago on chaos theory and patterns occurring where there don't seem to be any. Weird, weird stuff.  Anyhoo, spoke with an old friend who I don't see as much as I probably should. I was talking with him and telling him about little relationship dramas I have encountered over the past while. He gave me this look shaking his head, almost pity with a splash of condescension. He told me that I was impossible. He said that it was extremely naive of me to keep turning my back on relationships with great guys that have so much potential. He said I am doing nothing except setting myself up for disaster, dissappointment and hurt. I said that no matter how great they might be, if "it's" not there, it's not there. I want the butterflies, I want the passion, I want to blush, I want anticipation... He laughed at me. He told me I had just described the first five mintues of a relationship but did I really have any clue what happened when the stopwatch beeped and that time was up? I admit that I realize all of the "new" relationship excitement will never last through everything, but shouldn't I continue to be excited about it on some level instead of getting bored and claustrophobic? I mean part of the excitement is getting to know someone and there isn't enough time in our lives to ever truly know everything about a person. I mean, can't you have comfort and familiarity and still be hopelessly taken with someone? He said no. He said what you end up with is friendship, which is what happens when the love is gone.  This friend has been with the same girl for about three years now. He says he doesn't know what "in love" is, but he loves her nonetheless. He says that she is familiar and he knows he won't find this kind of security or comfort with anyone else. I told him this sounded an awful lot like settling to me. He said it's maturing.  If it were his way, he would have me pick one nice boy who treated me well and wasn't afraid to call me on shit and have me stay with him for good. He says that is what makes a relationship. Forget love, he told me. Forget romance. Forget the butterflies.  Now I'm kinda floating somewhere between feeling really sad for him and hoping to high heavens that what he speaks isn't the truth. Because, if it is, I am indeed doomed. I will never be content to "settle", nor will I ever be happy if I feel that someone has "settled" for me just because nothing better came along. "Settling" is one of the most awful things in this world to me. He must be wrong... right?

      A post on another blog recently got me to thinking about childhood crushes.  Crushes on me, crushes that I had and what kinds of things kids do to try and win over other kids of the opposite sex. (Great story about this on the Daily Invention blog)  I have a lot of difficulty in time frames from when I was younger.  But some things I remember clearly...  I remember a boy named Dominic trying to win me over by showing me his secret talent was drinking orange soda through a straw and then blowing it out of his nose. I remember being really young and having a little boy in the park walk over to a stranger, take her lunch off the bench beside her and come try to give it to me. I remember (probably around grade 7) sitting in my room and hearing an awful racket coming from outside - a boy was standing under my window with his little tape player singing along to a Wilson Phillips song (that did not win me over). There is no end to stories I can tell about silly things little boys have done - I think it's in their nature.  The name of my first ever crush was Christopher. Our parents were friends, I guess I must have been around 5 years old. We would play together at the park all the time. He once made his father take him to railroad tracks near where we lived so he could set down a penny that the train would flatten when it passed by and then he could give it me. He also used to always pick blackberries for me.  For Halloween that year I dressed up as a princess and he dressed up as my prince.  Then I moved.  But I still have the penny.  I can't think of anything I did when I was younger to try to win boys over. When boys would like me I would most often be mean and want nothing to do with them - much like now (hahaha) But I did like to show off, especially when I was really young. I remember going to the park and being so proud of these new frilly bloomers my mum had got me. I would swing upside down on the monkeybars giving all the little boys a show of my pretty frills.   Of my early public school time I had a couple of major crushes. One's name was Patrick, but I can't remember for the life of me why I liked him. Another was Cary Elwes as Wesley from the Princess Bride. I used to run through the woods by our home pretending I was Princess Buttercup and calling, "Oh my sweet Wesley". It's pretty self-explanatory why I liked him. Hehehe...  And the final one was my best friend's older brother, Alain. He was a punk skater who was 5 years older than me, and he was a bad boy (the beginning of a saga of bad trends to follow me over the years). If he even looked at me I would blush and go running. I remember he touched my hand one time to help me paint something on the wall of their unfinished basement that they were allowed to do what they wanted with. And he used to play the guitar, I would sit there for hours and listen to him. But one day while playing around with my friend down there she dared me to say "Sex Pistols" 5 times (they had a huge graffittied piece with that written in it on the wall) and the word "sex" just seemed taboo back then. Well I did it, only to turn and find him there leaving me completely mortified and embarrassed and I never looked at him again...  Ah, childhood memories...

      Back in May is when I first realized through this tracking program I am using that web searches with certain keywords will bring up my blog in the results. This was determined when I realized that someone searching for 'dirty crosswords' had come upon an old entry. Pleased with this, I  wrote  urlLink here  that I was going to begin entering random words and phrases into my paragraphs so that my posts would come up during people's bizarre little searches.  Jokingly I wrote: Midget Anal Sex.  Just now, while checking my stats it turns out that it's finally happened and someone looking for midget anal sex came onto my blog. Hehehehe..... This is a wonderful start to my day. I am most pleased.

      Last night I finally had the kind of night that I had been wanting for quite a while. My friend came and picked me up and we drove down to the beach. We walked and went to this one spot where I hadn't been in a long time - sand, rocks, trees... Typical beach/waterfront type stuff but things I also don't see enough living in the city. We sat there staring out onto the water and talked for hours. I felt like I had been clammed up so tightly for so long without even realizing to what degree. Once it started coming I just couldn't stop it. So much that has been playing on my mind and bothering me I was able to release. I even had a good cry which is something that I also have felt just under the surface for some time. I think part of the cry was for all that I had been feeling but unable to express, and part was just simple relief at finally being able to get it out. And he isn't even that good of a friend... but he turned out to be last night. Things I didn't even know I had been feeling were spewing from my mouth like rapidfire. I hold too much inside. I walk around with this 'face' on always worrying about everyone else, being there for them and helping them and listening to them. I have felt so alone, no one has even taken any kind of notice to the fact that maybe I have needed a friend - maybe I have needed someone to just sit and listen to me; my fears, my doubts, my insecurities. It's like when they take two seconds from their problems to look at me and sense that maybe something is off, it is only a moment before that thought is replaced by "Oh she's M&amp;#@, she's ok. She's always ok" and go back to worrying about themselves or problems their other friends are facing. I can only give so much.  Last night someone finally listened to  me . Unconditionally with no judgments, no making fun of or teasing, no sarcasm, no counting the seconds until I stopped so they could go back to talking about themselves, no trying to turn everything around to make it seem as if my feelings were not legitimate, no advice to give - just listening. And it was someone whom I never expected it to be. Where are all of those who think they have the privilege of calling me their  friend  but refuse to substantiate this claim with any kind of action? It's strange to me that someone who is more distanced from me, someone who I haven't always been the nicest to, who could have walked out of my life and I probably wouldn't have even noticed turned out to be a better friend to me and more concerned and caring than the people who I consider closest to me. I was surprised, but in a good way and I'm thankful for that.  We walked back to the car and we drove over to an ice cream place where he bought me a huge banana split as a surprise because he knows how I love them. We sat on the bench out front and ate and in that moment I felt like I could finally laugh. Not the uncomfortable, so much is not being said when it should be, drugged up, or boozed out laughing - honest, genuine, sincere laughter. What a relief. After our ice cream we came back to my place and sat here until about four in the morning watching movies. After he left I felt as though I had just been given the best massage in the world after experiencing awful back knots. That kind of relaxation is something I rarely experience, but apparently I was all knotted up emotionally and mentally. I slept better than I have in many months and for the first time in longer than I can recall I didn't dream.  I have been so tired of clubs, pubs, bars, parties... I just want to do something that feels real. I'm not sure how I would define  real  but this was a taste of it. I'll still party, like a fiend I'm sure, but I want to start doing more that does not involve alcohol, drugs, or any kind of substances. Or if it does involve them, then let it be something different. I hate going out and knowing exactly how a night is going to be. I might not know every little detail of what will happen, but I know that I will probably go to someone's house, drink, do lines, go out to a club or bar, dance and get more drunk and fucked up, probably head to some kind of gathering afterwards or just chill at a friends, drag my ass home in the morning and start dealing with the comedown. It might vary by location or the company present, but it all ends up the same. It feels routine and predictable, and I hate it more and more lately.  I am getting increasingly restless, pacing around feeling stir-crazy. Nothing seems to fulfill me anymore. Part of me wishes I knew what I wanted out of life so I could just say "fuck it" to everything and everyone and go after it. Part of me wants to drop off the earth for awhile and leave all of this behind without a word and without looking back. Just go somewhere new and start over completely with no attachments, no strings, no ghosts coming back to haunt me, no contact with people I know, no promises that don't get kept, no expectations which are never met or acted upon... Nothing and no one has inspired me in too long a time. I feel fairly happy right now in a general way but I could be happier. I could have friends that I could count on. I could feel fulfilled in my life. I could meet someone and really fall in love again, which is something I realize I completely forget - what is it like to be in love, to love and to feel loved back? What is it like to be intimate with someone beyond one night? What is it like to hold hands or cuddle or kiss without the expectation of sex followed by my running out the door with a "Thanks, it's been fun" at 7:30am? What's it like to be looked at and adored? What's it like to receive a compliment and not doubt the genuineness of it? What's it like to start a relationship and a month or two in not be gripped by the nausea and stomach knots that tell me to "Get out now". Maybe now it's time for a change. Maybe I'm just giddy from too much coffee and a really good sleep.

      I was at Bloor station just before lunch hour today. I was standing on the platform impatiently waiting for the subway to come while browsing through a book. I grabbed a daily paper from one of the benches and was looking through to find my horoscopes hoping that today's did not suggest that I need professional help.  I heard a moan coming from a bench down the way facing the opposite platform. A guy who was standing near me with his guitar heard it too. We looked at each other briefly and then looked back towards the bench. I poked my head forward out of curiousity. A young guy and his girlfriend were sitting there, his head was back and eyes closed. One of the daily newspapers was slightly layed over his thighs. Her arm got lost under that paper somewhat but you could tell very distinctively that there was movement and she was giving him a tug. These two were no more than about 14/15 I'd say. I looked back up at Mr. Guitar-guy and he was blushing and kind of motioned his hand towards his crotch in disbelief as if to confirm what was really happening between the kids. I stared down at my paper and tried to hold back the giggles. After all, I wouldn't want to interrupt their moment before his release, that would have been just rude of me ;)  While I am putting on my best attempt at not focusing on what was happening, I heard a man's voice booming from the other side of the platform. Subway security. The two kids were mortified. Security yanked off the paper from the boy's lap while the poor kid was racing to do up his pants. The girl started crying as he told them that they had better come upstairs. The boy's face was all contorted, probably a combination of embarrassment and pain. I looked at  Mr. Guitar-guy again and neither of us could hold back anymore - we mutually lost it, laughing hysterically until the train came. This whole incident happened in about five minutes. Too funny.  I was also at a Human Resources office today. A girl, probably around my age, was sitting near me speaking to some woman talking about the possibility of her going on Unemployment Insurance. She said she just needed it for now, only until her real business took off. When asked what the "real business" was, the girl explained that her goal was to be a professional escort. But she just needs help getting there. Another moment where giggles had to supressed. Good to know that even escorts are seeking government assistance in building up their business, and apparently this girl's dreams.  What a morning.

      I am tired.  Saturday night I went over to my friends who are the porn stars house for a party they were throwing. It wasn't a huge industry party though and I wasn't the token 'non-industry' person there this time - I was pleased. The plan was that I was going to go there for awhile and then around midnight/1 am I was going to head down to the club, meet a whole bunch of people&nbsp;and hear some good techno. Yeah... Never happened. I got completely wasted and really high and was just having too much fun to leave. Then I got a phone call from a friend who came to the party and picked me up around 4:30am. We went back to his place and chilled there doing pills, more coke and drinking wine. I somehow made it back home around 7:30 in the morning more of a mess than I've been in a long, long while - it's impressive that I even made it home at all, let alone in one piece (well that is still disputable).  Back at home I soon found that sleep was way beyond anything I was capable of. Wired, wired, wired. Messy, messy, messy. But at a certain point you just have to brace yourself for the inevitable. I curled up in the fetal position on the couch and tried desperately to will away the pain that was coming on strong. I was supposed to do that session with my girlfriend but the client re-scheduled for later in the week - thank God. Eventually I was able to force down a sandwich which helped some but not enough. I dozed sporadically for about an hour and had awful dreams. Dreams that involved people&nbsp;who are very close to me&nbsp;betraying me and purposely going out of their way to hurt me. That was enough of sleepland for me. Around 4pm I decided that wine was pretty much the only option to help with the de-fuzz, so I started into it pretty hard. And it worked. By 7pm I was layed out on the couch, not in pain so much as ridiculously trashed.   Phone rings. Friend told me that he was coming by in an hour and I got a feeling he wasn't going to be coming empty handed - trouble that one is. And I was right. By 8:30pm I had fallen face first back into the snowbank I had spent the entire day trying to dig myself out of. I should have just stuck with the wine and crashed early- but that would have made too much sense, and I've never been one to turn down&nbsp;the powder. My one friend&nbsp;has suggested that I might be a 'dust bunny' - he may be right.  By 1am I was a lost cause and looked up to find myself at this gay club listening to half-decent house doing rails with a really old friend I hadn't seen in about&nbsp;a year. I also found out another old friend of mine from about 6 years ago had just moved back to Toronto two weeks ago. 3am brought me back to a guy's house busting even more rails. Finally dragged my ass back home around 4am.&nbsp; Tossed and turned and tried to sleep, tried to think&nbsp;and ponder life, tried to wake up my house guest hoping he would entertain me - I failed on all three counts. 6am = familiar pain of a rough comedown again, even rougher now that it is day 2 with no real sleep. 7:30am = finally managing to pass out with a cold face cloth on my forehead. 11:30am = my waking up from an awful sleep with a pounding headache and unclear thoughts.   This is me now. Rambling, tired beyond all belief and agitated. Have to run to the post office to send something to my mother, then it's back to the couch in the fetal position hoping to pull off a couple more hours of sleep if I can.  Talk about masochistic tendancies.

      This is a conversation my friend had with a potential client over speakerphone while I was at the dungeon. It is pretty much bang on as far as what words were used. There was a severe language barrier with this guy.   Her: Hello  Him: Hi is this A?  Her: Yes it is.  Him: How are you?  Her: I’m fine, how can I help you?  Him: I get your number from Carrie, she refer me and said you could help me out.&nbsp;  Her: Carrie? Oh, right I’m taking over some of her clients now that she is moving only to full service. So… what kind of session are you looking to have?  Him: Um… What do mean ‘session’?  Her: You are calling for a session, right? A session: a booking with me. What are you looking to have happen – what kind of service do you want?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Him: Umm… What do you mean ‘session’ and ‘service’?  Her: What are you calling for?  Him: Carrie referred me.  Her: What do you want then?  Him: What do you do?  Her: I provide fetish and bdsm services.  Him: Hunh?  Her: Fetish and bdsm: bondage, beatings, humiliation, worship…  Him: How much?  Her: $300 an hour.  Him: Too much! Too much! You give to me for $100 for one hour?  Her: My rates are non-negotiable. The service is well worth the money hun.  Him: I pay you $100.  Her: NON-NEGOTIABLE.  Him: What you do for that much money?  Her: I told you, fetish and bdsm. What are you looking for?  Him: You will fuck me, yes?  Her: Ohhhhhhhhh no huney. I don’t do that.  Him: Yes? You fuck?  Her: I’ll fuck you up the ass if you want.  Him: Hunh? I fuck you in the ass is ok?  Her: No. I can fuck YOU in the ass.  Him: I don’t understand.  Her: I don’t have sex under any circumstances. You do not get to touch me at any point. I provide a specialty service, I don’t do full service. I think there must have been a misunderstanding with Carrie, you should call her back she can help you out with full service huney.  Him: Oh no. I called you now. You can help me.  Her: I only provide fetish services. What do you want?  Him: I just want love.  Her: You want love? (She is giggling like crazy by this point) I don’t give love to anyone but my husband sweetie.  Him: You can give me love?  Her: I can tie you up, beat you and call you Hilda.  Him: Who's Hilda? You can spank me?  Her: Yes, yes that I can do.  Him: Then you suck my dick?  Her: No, but if you’re a good boy I’ll let you suck my dick.  Him: You have a dick? I will be allowed to suck?  Her: I have a strap-on with which I can fuck you in the ass and then make you suck it afterwards.  Him: I don’t understand.  Her: You never will huney. Call Carrie back I can’t do anything for you, sorry. There was obviously a misunderstanding between you two when you spoke.   End.

      Busy, busy weekend.&nbsp; The weather is fucking phenomenal.   Yesterday afternoon went with my room-mate to Mount Pleasant Cemetary to walk around. It's a huge cemetary that is full of rolling hills, unique trees, fountains and gardens. It is serene and breathtaking and makes you feel for a little while as if you had left the city. It comes across as more of a park area than an actual cemetary - like the plots, mausoleums and gravestones are there only for decoration but not its sole purpose. It's famous among joggers and bicyclists for its great paths.   Anyways, we just walked the paths checking out the different sights. We looked through windows of mausoleums belonging to the extremely wealthy families. One was built as a small castle and was probably comparable in size to the bottom floor of my house. It had the most deatiled and gorgeous big stone angel in it, with stained glass portions on the roof so the light shone through and different colours danced as though on water on the angel's surface. Too beautiful. We saw a hawk come swooping down and land on the top of a&nbsp;monument that was about 15 feet high that&nbsp;we were looking at. It stared&nbsp;at us for a moment, made a sqwak or whatever sound they make and then while perched&nbsp;opened up its wings to full span. Then it flew away. Even one of the groundskeepers who was driving a cart by was impressed and had never seen one there&nbsp;before. Apparently we were special guests and it wanted to say a hello. Things like that - coincidence or some kind of sign? Hmmm. Tried not to read too much into&nbsp;it, but it&nbsp;has still been playing on my mind.   Got home from the walk and received a phone call from my girlfriend who runs the dungeon. So I ran back out and met her to go for my first training session. It was a sickening amount of fun. I learned the proper way to flog someone,&nbsp;how to do it so that marks left are minimal. I guess it seems that I am a natural and have perfect aim with next to practice. One of the girls there who is a submissive apparently&nbsp;can't even get her aim right or&nbsp;have the control in pressure and she's been doing it for a few years. A natural flogger? It made me kind of giggle to think that I&nbsp;had a aptitude for beating. I learned a bit about whipping and caning. Whipping is difficult, as I suspected. But I didn't expect caning to be so hard. That's gonna take some practice.   I got my first lessons in wrist, arm, and&nbsp;leg bondage - once again, supposedly a natural. Hehehe... Found out the correct way to apply nipple clamps of several varieties and how to correctly suspend&nbsp;someone in chains from the ceiling. The girl who plays 'sub' was kind enough, or rather excited enough, to&nbsp;be a guinea pig for my training over a five and a half hour period. So...&nbsp;essentially I spent my&nbsp;Friday night beating and&nbsp;clamping a girl. Is that strange??? I could hear out the&nbsp;windows of the dungeon things beginning and picking up in clubland down below - if only they&nbsp;knew what was going on&nbsp;four flights up.&nbsp;   I have my first job tomorrow. Well, &nbsp;  I won't really be doing anything. Just sitting as a watcher and getting paid for it- but I do get to dress up in the gear, which I am pretty excited for. My girl is also going to extend the session for free in exchange for the client being a guinea pig so she can go over some techniques for cock and ball torture as well as strap-on methods. Hahahahaha! I'm a bit weary about these things. I'm a bit self-conscious about an actual client being involved. Once I've gotten&nbsp;more training she is going to bring me in on a doubles session where I am playing a lower role than her and she will handle most things but will tell me what to do. That will be the true test of whether or not this is a path I want to explore further. If I walk away from that feeling how I did last night when I left, then I think I'm in. Otherwise, I'll just walk away knowing it was never for me.   My mother called while I was there last night. When she asked what I was doing, I told her that I was at my friend's dungeon beating some girl with a flog. She laughed and asked what I was doing really. I told her again. She thought I was screwing around. This has happened before with drugs, when I told her once that I had been up all night doing coke and getting high. She just dismisses it as my joking around. It's funny how parents will so often refuse to see any kind of truth to their children's actions. Let her think what she will of me then,&nbsp;if that's where she finds&nbsp;comfort.&nbsp;

      I am feeling restless.   I was sitting out on my front porch this morning, the humid air thick and heavy. I was trying to read but couldn't concentrate at all so I&nbsp;just sat there, drinking my coffee and staring at the street, the cars driving, the occasional person walking, the trees and lawn of the school across the way.&nbsp;   I&nbsp;watched&nbsp;a couple of&nbsp;ants fighting over a dead fly, yanking it this way and that. They were working against each other - it seemed one wanted to go towards the steps, the other towards the bench. Then it stopped. It's like they realized they should co-ordinate their efforts. They began to move the fly together in the same direction which was neither towards the steps or bench. The postman came and stepped on them while passing me the mail.   My mind was drifting and a feeling of being completely lost came over me. And it's of no consolation to think that so many other people I know are feeling lost right now too. I don't know what to do with myself and am feeling like I'm lacking any kind of purpose.&nbsp;   My corporate career in finance seems like a distant dream since I've left it. I remembered a time there when I was sure of so much.&nbsp; It was all about making the money, and I made good money too. It didn't matter what I was doing or who I was working for or my 9-5 routine, the national accounts I was handling, the promotion, the office politics... Money. I was content with this for a couple of years. Then I woke up one morning and looked in the mirror and had no fucking clue who was looking back at me. I had become a drone going through programmed motions that I felt weren't even mine. I couldn't remember how I had gotten to this point, how I had allowed this to happen.&nbsp; I was living someone else's life. A life that I didn't belong to, a life that all of&nbsp;my 40-something co-workers&nbsp;had strived to get and were happy with.&nbsp; And I had tried desperately to numb myself and be content with it too.   There was a clashing of worlds, I would be this corporate yuppy working through millions of dollars in accounts every day and then I would over-compensate on the weekends with drug abuse, alcohol and partying. There was no medium - I was either an extreme adult or a fucked up kid depending on time of day and day of the week.   Money is necessary. It can give you room to do a lot and take part in things that make you happy. But I had to ask myself what I was sacrificing for this. It was too much. Many people I know think that I am fool, I know. Maybe I am. No, I probably am. I know I could get a job in two mintues flat at some other firm doing the same kinds of things and making equally good money - but I am terrified to go back to that.   So this morning: porch, coffee, ants, mail, lost.&nbsp;I feel like I need to take the opportunity, with my not working right now, to check things out. But I have no fucking clue how. That's part of why I've been considering trying things out at the dungeon and other random places. These are things I wouldn't normally do. Things that I know I won't do forever, that I won't make any kind of a career out of but I feel like now is the time when I should do what I want for once.   What do I want?   That is the big question indeed. I am so fucking confused I can barely stand it. I don't know anything anymore. I don't know what will make me happy, but I feel I deserve to be. I don't know who I am or where I should be going.&nbsp; I don't know who I care about and who I don't. I don't know who my true friends are. The only things that seem tangible to me are those which I induce - getting high, getting drunk, having random sex...   I've been taking it kind of easy lately. I haven't been out every night or partying all the time like I normally am. Mind you, I have been drinking pretty much every day.&nbsp; It's making me restless, this feeling of lost coupled with feeling like I don't want to relax anymore. I want to get out there, I am afraid of missing something.   Fuck it. I am hungover and being more reflective than I care to be right now. (Enter me shaking head and throwing hands up in defeat)

      "Like most of us, all he really wanted was a bit of honest fellowship and an easier time of it. And like most of us, he just couldn't quite get a handle on how. So his life has been one long, sad litany of unrequited loves, misdirected longings, and misplaced loyalties, all of which the poet in him has set to rhyme, amassing a treasure trove of past laments that he keeps in Jersey, locked away in a trunk"   -Lee Stringer

      I just got compared to one of my friend's mothers.&nbsp;I take this as a pretty big insult coming from them. I've been called a lot of things in recent days but none have left a sting like this. The equivalent, in my opinion, would be like comparing someone to my father (well maybe not so extreme, but not far off either) - who was&nbsp;so far beyond a&nbsp;complete ass, but we won't get into that here. Comparing someone to a parent in a negative way is bad. Because it's these parents whom we blame for all of our issues (chances are we're right) and who we, even in old age, most often harbor hostile feelings towards. We do not forget parent-related shit, and the thought that I might remind someone of their mother whether in tone or&nbsp;whatever really doesn't please me.&nbsp;Wow. Not sure what to say about that. Except a lot of things suddenly make sense, and a lot of things are going to be pretty fucking easy from here on in.   Damn.&nbsp;

      I was just writing a letter to a friend of mine who is going through something of a difficult time. After I had written it I was sitting thinking about the things that I said and that's when it hit me. It was advice that I also need.  &nbsp;  I find it slightly strange, but not bad, how when looking a situation objectively such as giving advice to a friend, that the advice which we give is often the advice we most need. Our situations are different, but the message and possible method of coping can be the same, especially when drawn out and geared more specifically to each of us. I went back and reread the letter and now feel so much better about certain things I am trying to deal with.&nbsp; Normally I can't take my advice worth shit, possibly because it hits too close to home - but there is something that can be said about today.&nbsp; Maybe all I needed was a bouncing board. I know what needs to be done now.  &nbsp;  If you happened across my violently aggressive post the other day before I removed it, it is pretty obvious that I have been trying to deal with issues of people taking me for granted, using me, and just not being the nicest.&nbsp; I have been extremely frustrated and have been feeling really alone. A few people I believed I could count on, well they have proven otherwise.&nbsp; I think I know the best course of action at this point in dealing with this dilemma. And although the solution may appear easy, I fear it's not going to be - but in the long run I know it will be the best.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Another thing I find kind of strange is how expendable people seem to be nowadays. I don't know if it maybe has something to do with the fact that I'm not so terrified of being alone anymore or maybe I've just had it and have been walked on and hurt by too many. But I am finding it easier and easier to simply remove people, close friends even, from my life.&nbsp; This could, of course, completely backfire and I'll end up bitter and alone in the end with no one to talk to except for a cat or a dog, but would I not rather that than to allow myself to be put down, treated horribly and not appreciated? I think so.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Things and people that seemed so important to me for so long, just don't quite so anymore. I guess this is natural with change and growth, but I kind of always assumed certain things and people would grow with my changing ideals, not away from them.&nbsp; Simply having a history with someone isn't enough anymore. So much has become about weighing odds against one another in recent times. Kind of like making mental pro's and con's lists. When the con's start to outweigh the pro's... time to go.  &nbsp;  But then, that brings me to wondering if maybe I'm not being to rash in certain situations. When should people be forgiven? How many chances should one receive? What are things which should be overlooked vs. things that just can't be? And at what point and I using my own fears as ammo or camouflage in making these decisions????  &nbsp;  Apparently... I am having a day.&nbsp;

      Had a bit of a rough weekend at times. Hate lists were out in full force, especially last night. I was extremely irritated by a couple of people who officially made those hate lists in the top three spots. Hence the mildly venomous post I had previously written and in retrospect seemed a bit harsh, so I feel that my ‘wee vent’ was better removed. (Adam,&nbsp; it&nbsp;would have&nbsp;indeed been more interesting to think that I was&nbsp;so angry it caused me to urinate... hehehe)  &nbsp;  Sleep has also been very difficult this past weekend. Last I night I spent from 4am until now tossing and turning, getting up to pace and then laying back down, beating the pillows and bed… What little sleep I did get was haunted by dreams whose effects on me were as if someone had been running sandpaper over my deepest concerns, fears and feelings – rubbing them raw, leaving nothing untouched.  &nbsp;  Friday I took care of some minor details and getting more information on my possibly starting at my friend’s dungeon, I’m still undecided. But I met with a photographer that she knows and had told about me. This person wanted to me meet me badly and has offered me a good chunk of money to pose for a few pictures (mostly in bondage positions) for this hardcover artsy book they are putting together. This I could do. I find out more details about the shoot this week.  &nbsp;  Then I started feeling a bit off, and wondered how all my so-called normal friends were doing. Those who, although might be a little eccentric, don’t work in the sex industry at all and seem less tainted. I missed them something awful, I guess some times we get swept up in the excitement and entertainment of others who seem more interesting. So… I made my rounds, went for cocktails, saw someone I totally didn’t expect to which was the best surprise and stayed up all night chilling with them.  &nbsp;  Chilled with ‘the porn stars’ this weekend as well. This was not a huge party as before but just a small group of people hanging out and swimming and stuff. It was good times. Except I was the token ‘natural’ and ‘not in the industry’ girl. Everyone, at some point or another, had to take turns grabbing at my tits just for the novelty of them being implant-free. Pure jokes from all these guys. Pure indulgence.  &nbsp;  Now: I know I’ve mentioned this before, but my neighbors are insane and not in a good way. Besides the whole ‘Bundy” family thing they have going on, the best way to describe them is: attitude is that of a pretentious old money family, but with the class of nothing more than a backwoods trailer park. Friday night they had this pre-party thing to their annual big summer blowout party which was on Saturday. I saw things from those people over those two nights that will no doubt haunt me forever. There was karaoke, Lionel Richie, old people bumping and grinding and performing lewdly, singalongs while dancing erotically on tables to ‘Like A Virgin… all fucking bad. &nbsp;My one friend who was here for a bit has been scarred by these events. She just kept looking at me in disbelief saying, “Are these people for real?” She couldn’t believe any of it. They are so trashy. Every time they start in on these kinds of behaviors, all I can do is go grab a bottle and start hitting… hard. Drinking and viewing them as entertainment is the only way we’re ever going to be able to co-exist in this neighborhood.

      I have come to realize that my house guest has a slightly bizarre new practice. I have know him for about 8 1/2 years, and despite how obvious his more hyper-active and exhibitionist tendencies are, I have never known this particular one to exist; at least not to this extreme.  &nbsp;  Upon waking in the morning he paces around and checks his messages while mumbling incoherent moanish type words similar to: "unnghhhh nnnnn ahhhh bleeeerrrrr".&nbsp;Ordinarily they might mean something, but in this case you can't even bother to figure out what unless he does the point n' grunt to convey the message (ex. points at a glass and motions to his mouth while spewing "ughghhgrhrhhhshhwy" which I assume means that he would like a glass of water).  &nbsp;  I can handle this type of behaviour and realize it is often consistent with heavy sleepers who are not morning people. It's what comes after this that I have some difficulty with. While he paces and starts to make a bit more sense, he has begun to pull down his boxer shorts so that his ass hangs out.&nbsp; He will then strut around the kitchen, well more specifically in front of the big glass doors which open to the backyard, and proceed to rub his exposed&nbsp;derriere all over that glass. When he gets really ambitious, he opens the sliding door just wide enough so he can fit his bare ass out to show the world. I think he likes the feel of the outdoor air on his unconcealed rear. That and maybe he gets a perverse enjoyment&nbsp;out of it because he knows it bugs me.  &nbsp;  Now what is concerning me about this whole behaviour are a couple of things:  &nbsp;  1) The ass sludge aka bum scum that is left on the glass after one of his rub-downs. Granted, it isn't always visible, but you still know it's there...  2) The fact that maybe I should be more concerned about this than I really am. I mean, is this normal? Do a vast majority of people wake up and do this every morning from their homes? I haven't known any others. But coming from him, as shocking as that white ass might be before I've had my coffee, it seems to somehow fit and kind of makes sense.&nbsp; &nbsp;  I think I need to start investing in more windex if this is going to continue.

      I have started a new blog in addition to this one. It can be found  urlLink here . It will simply house silly rambles and stories about things that have happened to me in the past as this is something I have been somewhat revisiting as of late, digging through old journals and writings. I decided that they should be kept separately from this one. We'll just have to see what unravels...

      On Friday night I dragged my roommate out to a jazz club as this saxophone player, Mike Murley, who is so great was playing with another quartet. Sick, sick, sick, sick jazz. I've seen them before and they have never disappointed. The trumpet player was equally incredible - actually, fuck it, all five of them were fabulous. There was this petite girl who looked about my frame and age that was playing the stand-up bass and she blew me away. The bass was easily two or three times her size and she was killing it, wow. My roommate was pretty blown away over the whole thing and I'm glad that I was able to introduce him to something different that he could possibly grow to love. But I can't deny that I have somewhat selfish motives in this - if he can appreciate it and get excited over it, then this will give me one more person who will be more than happy to join me on my journeys to the different jazz clubs. I have a couple of friends who are ok with it once in a blue moon, one girlfriend who loves it but has moved away to New York, and another who loves it but I doubt will ever come with me because I don't think saying they went to a jazz club is a "cool" enough story to tell around. Still had a great time out this night though although I got a bit too wasted...  Went back to the dungeon for a bit and had some interesting conversations. Apparently my thoughts on being too petite and fair to do any dom work was quite a misconception. It seems that with the whole fetish culture becoming so much more mainstream nowadays that a lot of men are looking for someone of my size and look, and an older woman who has been doing this for eons told me that she would be willing to start training me immediately because of how much money she predicted I could make. Interesting stuff indeed. I was also made an offer of doing a short photo shoot dressed up in full gear with the intention of providing two shots, no nudity whatsoever, to this professional to post on his femdom site - for these two shots I was offered $500. I have no clue if I will accept this or not, I was supposed to let him know today but because I am still undecided he gave me awhile longer, if I agree he wants to do the shoot on the 19th. All of this is a little bit overwhelming.  I was also told a story of an extreme session a couple of the girls did a little while ago. It was an abduction. This guy who is a regular that they know requested it, signed all the forms so they would have an idea of what he liked and how far they should go. Then one day when he wasn't expecting it - bam! He was jumped, brought to this location and held captive for 24 hours while they did crazy things to him. I won't go into them here but I was horrified at the details. I guess that he LOVED it and is apparently saving up to do another. For this 24 hours he paid an  obscene  amount of money. Wow. It reminded me of that movie "The Game" with Michael Douglas, just some crazy shit. Interesting, granted, but crazy and often leaving me shaking my head in disbelief.  Now: I've finally come down from my weekend and am slowly gathering the pieces of me back up. Over-indulgence as per usual. I think I'm on a break now though. I've been going too hard too much lately (every fucking day) and it all came crashing down yesterday. In the evening when the pain had subsided a bit and my head wasn't so foggy I was able to take a bit of a step back and look at how I had behaved throughout the day in the throws of one fuck of a hangover/comedown. I know there's always a hint of a bitch in me, but sometimes it gets so extreme that you notice it more. This was the case yesterday. I was a vile cunty bitch, period. Excuse the language but that's the only way to describe it. I was spitting venom at everyone who I came into contact with in the most horrible of ways. Mind you, some of those people probably deserved a touch of it for picking on me because of the state I was in, but not as bad as I dished it out. I was pure evil. Today I figure at some point I am going to have start handing out apologies, I am working up towards that one now.... Fuck.

      Yesterday I went to the dungeon that one of my girl-friends runs downtown. It's so fucking gorgeous and has great atmosphere. I helped her sew some maroon coloured velvet curtains for one of the rooms. Right now they're doing renovations in a different part of the studio in order to make up an interrogation room, hehehe. As a joke her and one of the other girls took a picture of me on the St. Andrew's Cross, it's good for a giggle but not very convincing since I'm in normal street clothes.   Going to this place just provides me with too much entertainment and often leaves me feeling a bit like a kid in a candy store. In a way I see it like a giant adult fetish Toys R Us. There are just lots of cool toys, gadgets and props all over the place and you want to touch them and find out how they work, find out about different fetishes and methods used. It's really fucking cool and I love learning about it all. This is a pretty serious profession, a lifestyle, but when these girls are out of their character it can be so much fun. Fuck, it can be fun even when they're in character. They also advised me that anytime I want to use any part of the dungeon for personal endeavors or escapades that I am more than welcome. Not sure if I'd ever take them up on it, but it's cool to know that should I ever feel like gettin' freaky with someone I may be seeing that I have access to this kind of stuff. (Enter here me desperately trying to polish my halo which is ever so tarnished)  Today I got a call from that same girlfriend. She has offered me work. Not doing pure dom stuff, which I don't think I have the nerve to do professionally. I also don't think I really have the typical build or look and probably wouldn't make the best cash unless I went into a submissive role, which would  never  happen. I guess she has a couple of regulars though who on occasion enjoy where someone is essentially just sitting there and watching as she does the session. And one in particular is requesting a smaller, more innocent looking girl to play that role. I told her I would have to think about it. Part of me is saying, "What the fuck? It's not like I have to do anything except sit there and watch her go at him" and the other part of me is a little more nervous and unsure. Would this be crossing a line? Although I know lots of people in lots of different areas of the sex industry, I have never dappled in becoming a part of it in any way. But it's not like this would require any kind of contact... fuck, I'm undecided. Interesting offer though and definitely something to ponder on.  I'm supposed to go back either tonight or tomorrow to chill and help out with some more of the sewing and renovations. Some of those house boys will be around this time to dote on me at the command of my friend which could be even more fun. Hehehehe

      Last night as I was walking to the store I noticed something a bit strange on a window of the arts school. Someone must have been drunk and vomited profusely while they were walking by at some point over the weekend. This is normal. What is strange is that the vomit was up fairly high on the glass, well above six feet. Mildly confused I looked up and there are no windows that open in this building, so it couldn't have been some kid getting sick out a window on the second or third floor. Yep. Someone had to have completely projected it up and onto the window. I could have drank a full bottle, tons of shots, 15 beer and still my body would not be able to gain that much force to send any of my puke up that high. So... there are either drunken/ill giants now residing in my neighborhood, or all elements must have hit this poor person at once with them looking up at the correct angle with winds helping to gain that extra distance and height. Even if this person was six feet or just over, it would take something fairly big to get it up that high. That's pretty damn impressive in my books. Apparently as humans we are now evolving to being able to vomit upwards. hmmm...

      I am completely scatterbrained today. I am antsy and keep pacing back and forth having no clue what to do with myself.  Everything, all emotions and my actual physical senses are heightened, but not in a good way – pure anxiety. It feels like a million and one different things are being thrown at me at once and I am somehow expected to catch them all at the same time. Damn.  I have no idea what to write here. For the first time in many months I find I am at a loss for words.   I woke up this morning actually in a really good mood. I felt as though some weight had been lifted off of my shoulders at long last, a potentially bad situation resolved. Pressure and assumptions that I had been experiencing seemed to have been alleviated. I was wrong, at least partially. Maybe the previous ones had been lifted, but they have now only been replaced by others which are equally uncomfortable.  I am tired. I am confused. I am frustrated with my work. I am irritated with several acquaintances. I find I am stuttering and beating around the bush on words I should be speaking, except I’m having trouble finding those words because I fear they won’t be taken as being legitimate or true. I feel like someone will just be nodding their head, smiling, saying it’s all good but inside are really thinking “yeah right” and are essentially only humouring me. Silence is madness. Awkward moments which this silence lives within make me want to scream at the top of my lungs. I feel I am numb and have lost any kind of voice.  I think I’ve really fucked up this time.

      I say nothing. Why do I always remain silent, especially at the times when all I really want to do is scream? I want to make confession to all the people who are close to me, to tell them exactly what I think and how I feel. I am tired of this. I am tired of keeping quiet because I am afraid of hurting their feelings. I am tired of keeping quiet because I am afraid they will walk away and no longer be a part of my life. I hold so much back because I'm not sure of the legitimacy of my thoughts or feelings. What if in one insane moment I decide to spill all the truths which are flowing through my mind to those around me. How long will it take for regret to kick in or for me to realize that I've been wrong? In one moment there is too much potential for good and disaster. Sometimes myself, and others I know, have those moments of freedom which feel so good. And they usually occur as a result of intoxication or being under some influence. It probably feels safer to do it that way because of how easy it is to use alcohol and subtances as a scapegoat to avoid responsibility for your actions or words. This is done too often. It fucking pisses me off. It is taking everything in me right now to not reach over to the phone, pick it up and just start dialing numbers spilling all. I don't know. I just want to say the first thing that comes to my mind with the next person I speak to. Not think or edit, just spit it out full force. Fuck. Cracked out rambling girl that I am...

      This weekend has been a blur in many ways. Some abuse here, some bad judgment calls there, realizations on some issues, confirmations of others.  Essentially right now: I am giant fucking crackhead. And now that I actually have a moment to myself I'm not sure what the fuck to write.  I have a friend who just moved back to Toronto. He's been staying with me the past couple of days. It's good to see him. We haven't really hung out in about six or seven months. It's strange and awkward at times.  I'm not sure why, can't quite put my finger on it, and that kind of irritates me. That's all I'm going to say about that pal.  I did pcp for the first time in about ten years on Friday night. My conclusion: it's still exactly the same and does nothing more than cause me great confusion and delay in doing or understanding everything. Had plans to go out, those got canned as I just threw up my arms flustered and giving up because I just couldn't understand what the fuck was going on. So a friend came to chill with me, I should have had better judgment than to hang out with them. Too much drama. And it's like they subconsciously know when I'm going to be in vulnerable state and will say yes to getting together, and choose that exact moment to call me. Never fails. That's all I'm going to say about that friend.  Last night I did not go to the Porn party. My one friend who was more than eager to go with me, because of this reaction from him, made me want to go even less. Some people just don't fucking get exactly what these things are like and the list of whom I'm willing to bring to these is minimal. While contemplating if I would subject him and myself to the land of porn I went to another friends who was having people over to chill for awhile. I did a pill around that time and then as a tray of broken lines came way decided "what the fuck" and did one. Big mistake for me not to ask what it was. I  assumed  coke. I was mistaken. It was K. I was fully retarded and unable to move for several hours. This is why I don't touch that shit. Lesson learned. When coherence finally came back to me I got my shit together and came back home to chill for a bit and try to straighten myself out. It worked but then when my friend came back to pick me up I did another pill and got all messed up again. Hmh. Smack on the wrist for me. Almost got in a fight with some little thug guy who was coming on to me too strong and wasn't being very accepting of my not wanting him anywhere near me. Ok. Guy hits on girl. Girl says 'sorry not interested'. Guy gets all pissed off and begins threatening girl and gets even angrier and acts more surprised that the girl is not being very receptive to his initial anger. People are fucking stupid sometimes.  Somehow wound up back at home and my pal who is visiting showed up from his night out around 6am. We were both pretty retarded so we proceeded to get more so. It was a good morning. Good listening sessions. Stupid drinking game. Finally managed to pass out and woke up at around 6pm.   Now: it is quiet here. It's been raining off and on all evening. I am trying to de-fuzz, wake up and take the edge off. My feelings are awry and I can't make sense out of very much. You gotta love the aftermath which is more often than not, one fuck of a mess that leaves you scratching your head just trying to figure shit out. I want to curl up in my bed and stay there. I want answers to questions that are in my head - but I know they will never be answered. At this point I do not want mixed signals, strange questions or ultimatums, scenarios that have the possibility of turning too quickly in too many directions. I want: something that is sure and solid with no room for misinterpretation.  Today all areas should be black or white, no gray today. No maybe's. Yes or No questions only please.   That's all I'm going to say about these things now. Fuck. Need to go lay down.

      Friday night was interesting. Got all dazzled up in full dress, hair and heels and met up with a couple of friends. We went for cocktails at this lounge/bar that I had never been to before and never even knew existed. It's located at a non-existent address. Lots of beautiful people but damn, pretty fucking pretentious. Gorgeous bar though. Music was half decent and mostly an older crowd. It was an upper-class, high priced meat market.  I'm glad I was with someone who is very wealthy and was paying for the night because by the end of it he had spent more than I could believe. We had no problems getting in because the guy I was with "knows people". As we walked up to the front of the line we were immediately granted entrance. One guy was really desperate to get inside and was not believing the whole "packed" and "members only" lines being told to him. I saw him throw the bouncer what looked like four fifties and he was escorted through with us. There was no cover. What some people won't do. It was a cool place, that's for sure, but I wouldn't have paid $200 to get in. I will rarely even go to something if I have to pay anything to get in (concerts are the exception) - that's what friends and guestlist are for.  Overall, as I mentioned, it was an interesting evening in an environment that I am so not accustomed to. Don't have the cash or the sugar daddy to play in that land. I am pretty thankful for my girl-friend's friend though for taking us both out for the night and not letting us pay for anything. After the lounge where we met up with a couple of friends of his, we all went back to his gorgeous loft and he kept the booze and "other things" flowing. Very nice and generous guy, I was impressed with the evening. Left me feeling special, upper-class and snooty.  Last night was one of the best nights out that I've had in so fucking long. Our "girls" night. We got all perrtied up, but not to the lavish extent of the night before and these girls dragged me down to the "meat packing district", literally - except there women are the meat (and not in a way that has any class at all). I was not pleased. I've been to the bar we were going to several times as I have a friend who is a bartender there, but it's usually been on Thursdays or early on Fridays, I should keep it that way. Saturday nights equal all bad. The line-up was ridiculous. I refuse to wait in lines for very long. And the crowd there was equally ridiculous. All the women looked the same with their ho-gear on, bleached blonde hair and visibly spent a lot of quality time in tanning beds. The men also all looked the same. Too built, stocky, bad hair (if any) and no necks. I put my foot down and told them I would not do this. They agreed and because I was so traumatized by this place and the people in it they gave me the choice of places to re-locate to. I was in no mood for club land at all so I decided that we should head up to Little Italy and check out Mod Club.  I love making good decisions.  As I have said before, I always have a good time there. But last night was hands down the best. The music was amazing... when one of the dj's came on it was a huge show with lights and little lego people playing on the screen behind him. He broke into "Out of The Races and Onto The Tracks" by The Rapture and millions of bubbles began falling from above like rain. It's something different almost every time I go there. Sick music, sick atmosphere. Everyone was especially fucking nice and I don't think it was just because I was being more appreciative to have done a dodge on evil meat-bar.  We danced all night. There were a few particularly hot men I met who I will hopefully be seeing again in the very near future. There were still a few shady men who did the "come-up behind and start grinding against you while you're dancing" maneuver but I dealt with them accordingly. After one particular incident my girls went to the washroom and this mod cutie came up, started talking to me. He said him and his girlfriends had been laughing and getting great entertainment out of me because of how I would dodge shady men or be rude and blunt on declining their advances (one particular reference was to some vile actions I made towards a guy who kept trying to grab me who also asked me if I was a stripper, because if I wasn't I should be - which is ridiculous because I look nothing like a stripper at all and I was not dressed in such a way). I had to giggle.  There were some guys with a camera who kept coming up to me and my girls throughout the night asking to take pictures of us together and also with them. They were non-threatening so we humored them. So now some strange men have pics of me out there somewhere. The bright side of this is that at least they are not naked pics.  One guy who was chatting with me throughout the night proved pretty entertaining. He was short and a real cutie. At one point bits of paper (large rectangle confetti) started falling from above instead of the bubbles. He leaned over and told me that his phone number was written on every single one of those papers. I replied that was pretty impressive and he must have a lot of spare time on his hands. He said that he didn't do the work, he had a troop of keebler elves who wrote it on every piece for him. My first words were, "You mean you aren't a keebler elf?" because of his height. Then I grabbed a piece of the paper and it was blank. His elves were slacking. When he offerred me his number after this I declined saying that I couldn't possibly think of dating a guy who couldn't even keep his elves under control. Hehehe... Entertaining indeed - this guy was full of creativity throughout the course of the whole night.  We stayed right to the end of the night which I have never done before there. Out on the street afterwards we somehow became involved in this mini gathering with all these people and sat around smoking weed for quite some time. It was fun. Good people, great fucking night. Wow. We caused a fair amount of trouble but I won't get into those incidents on here. My girl from NY had a wicked time - we always used to do Mod Club together. The other girl who was with us is now addicted and had a great time as well. I love when I make good decisions.

      Update:  Things have been moving along fairly nicely at the dungeon. I've gotten quite a few outfits that I really like: stiletto boots, leather skirts, boustiers, pvc tops and skirts, latex tops... I kind of weirded my roommate out by prancing around to show him as this is all on the complete opposite end of the spectrum from the pretty girly things that I usually wear. Everytime I put this shit on and look in the mirror I don't recognize myself and feel like a stranger is looking back at me. Fun, fun, fun stuff. It's like playing dress up with mum's clothes all over again - except these clothes would never have been in my mum's closet.  I have been a diligent student to my friend's delight. All of this info and history behind BDSM practices and shit I find truly fascinating. And I have been reading and researching all that I can on the subject. As I have mentioned before one area that particularly interests me is the bondage. Especially when you get into the really intricate and beautiful stuff. Awhile ago I went down to the trusty neighbourhood hardware store and stocked up on tons of variety of ropes, which I have been using just to practice different techiniques while sitting at home. Great stuff. And although it will take a lot more time to become a pro with it, I think I'm getting pretty good so far. I've also got my flogging and caning techniques down. Still working on some aspects of the whipping though. The long ones are much more difficult to aim.  My friend has brought in one of her personal slaves twice so far for me to practice on. Before the first time we sat there talking about lots of shit for about two hours. I had some concerns and fears about certain aspects. She helped a lot and supposedly what I have been feeling is completely normal. I think my biggest issue lies in the whole role-playing portion of it. That coupled with the fact that I can tend to be shy under certain circumstances - and you have to admit that the situations which these things occur in are very intimate. They also relate to my not having so much confidence in what I'm doing yet - but I think this will change the more I practice and learn.  I still hold the stereotype of what a typical mistress should be in my mind, regardless of what I'm seeing or being told. I fear that a man will come into this and take one look at my little self and laugh at me. Which I'm sure will happen on occasion. But I was given a compliment by a man a few weeks ago who overheard me discussing these concerns with my friend. He came up, apologized for over-hearing what was being spoken of and said, "Men will worship you and do whatever you tell them. You're size does not matter. At first men will want to worship you and do your bidding simply because you are beautiful. When you add a firm and domineering attitude with that they will not be able to ask for more. Most men want beauty which you have and that will get you farther in this business than you realize." This made me feel so fucking good.  I'm also afraid of laughing during a session, which my friend assured me was definitely going to happen. She said the trick was simply turning it around and using that laughter as making fun of them to aid in any kind of humiliation. The final concern is if I am beating someone and I see them wince, even if they don't use their safeword and are loving it, seeing that I think my initial reaction will me to apologize and ask if they're alright. My friend said this is also normal and will wear off over time. Maybe I'm too sweet for this business. Hehehe, probably not.  So... anyways, this personal slave of my friends get brought in as a learning tool for me twice so far. He's a completely normal and average business man, working at firm downtown who is even really good-looking. And I mean  very  hot. That is intimidating on its own. I got to practice my beating, suspension, and bondage on him. I also got a taste of what the worship is like. And even more beneficial was that I saw my friend in full action. I was very impressed. I winced when he was begging her to fuck him in the ass with her strap-on with no lubrication. I tried to muster a laugh when he had her foot stuck in his mouth and her asking what he liked to be called... This guy gets off completely by being called "putz". He loves it. Near the end of the first session, while foot in mouth she teased him and finally came through with calling him "putz" he came right then in his shorts. Nothing was even touching him there, just his hand rubbing one foot and the other in his mouth with her calling him his special name. At the end of the second session he had been such a good boy she gave him permission to go in the corner and jerk himself off for release. Apparently that is what good boys get. She will never jerk a man off, only minimal cock and ball torture. If I end up doing CBT it will be a long ways down the road for me to feel comfortable. And I'm not sure I'll ever feel comfortable fucking someone with a strap-on. Ah well...  And so the education continues.

      It's Friday and I can say with much confidence that for the most part it's been a pretty fucking great week.  I got some extra cash, which was very nice. I got too drunk to celebrate this extra cash on Tuesday and spent some quality time face down in a bucket paying the price for the vodka. Waking up at 6am the following morning after thinking I had paid my dues in full, I was proven sorely wrong and had to give an equal amount of quality time to the toilet. Also succeeded in falling up my stairs (always classic) and hurting my arm. I have the bruise as a reminder. It's been a long fucking time since I got sick, I remember that I don't like it much at all.  I also had a chance to meet up with the guy I met at the gallery last weekend. I felt awkward about going to meet him later on Wednesday night after I had been drinking (well, was already fairly intoxicated) and was flushed because of it. Especially when he doesn't really drink - correction, he drinks but knows something that is only a myth to me: moderation. He is one of those rare few (rare in my life anyways with myself as no exception) who can meet up with someone and go for a beer or two and then end the night feeling fulfilled without having to get smashed once you start. We went for a cocktail at a bar down the street from his place then went back and chilled over a joint and a glass of wine talking until later in the night. He is really fucking interesting and we had great conversation. He's definitely got my attention. Now get this: he made me blush. Like a little fucking school girl. That's damn impressive. No boy has made me genuinely blush by just being so nice and sweet in... fuck, I can't even remember how long. I figure I must have peaked his interest as well considering he called me yesterday and we went out for coffee and then walking around the city. Once again, very nice time. I'm not quite sure what to make of this just yet. Am definitely proceeding with caution though.  It's all about perception. Getting drunk with a couple of other people and you are all funny and having a great time. Take me drunk out of that and throw me in with a sober person and I just feel like a fucking ass. Typical, I know. But it probably isn't the best way to go when I'm trying to get to know someone. I don't want to cover up my drinking or drug use. I've been down that road with boys before - but then again, those boys haven't really meant shit to me and the hiding and denying has always turned into more of an amusing game I like to play in those situations. But this one makes me want to stay sober in a way. When I chill with him I don't want to drink, I want to be fully coherent and I care what he thinks of me. But that brings up certain questions and thoughts in me. Choosing to stay sober for someone, this is has been proven to backfire every time, never lasts and always ends up catching up with you in the end because, as cliche as this is, you have to want to be sober first. And then I'm wondering about the initial impressions you want to create with someone during the beginning of starting to get to know them. How sincere and right are those impressions that you are creating? I mean, I'm being myself with this guy and I'm not hiding how much I drink or do drugs but am I letting him see the  real  me? Or am I fluffing things up here and there? Maybe a bit of both. But what happens when the  real  you starts to come out? If you were hiding it in the first place then it's like on some level you expect and know that this person will not be so accepting of you under those circumstances. There must be some middle ground no? Where you are with someone that you click with and aren't afraid to do stupid shit with them, to make a complete ass out of yourself and do things you just wouldn't do around so many others. How comfortable is too comfortable? When does 'fluffing' and putting forth a good impression become misleading and basically dishonest? Where does caring what someone thinks of you cross over into changing yourself for them? Where he doesn't really drink or do drugs I fear a day will come when an ultimatum will be given to me - quit or else... I hate ultimatums with a passion. I will choose the one that will most piss off the person giving it just out of spite - even if I'm losing because of it. Maybe this whole thing with this guy is bad news waiting to happen. But maybe it's not. Fuck. I don't know.  I think I over-analyze and am making excuses to get out of this potentially good thing before it even starts. I think he can just go fuck himself (in a nice way) because I will not apologize for who I am and I will not change for anyone. If he doesn't like it then what-the-fuck-ever. I do not like all this thinking and doubting. This is exactly the kind of shit that I hate dealing with and why I feel that straight forward sex with no commitment is much easier. But I haven't liked those guys in the same way I kind of like this one. Fuck. I refuse to discuss him on this blog anymore.  My girlfriend is getting in from New York and I am so fucking excited. This weekend is going to be a good one and I sense much trouble. Myself, my NY friend and another girl have this big "girl's night" planned for Saturday. T-R-O-U-B-L-E. Girl's nights are a rare occurrence in my little world, but when they happen... well, I'll start in on those stories some other time. We're going full out, getting all dressed up and slutted out (hehehe) for a night on the town. A lot has changed in my life since she moved away, I'm going to bring her down to the dungeon with me on Saturday during the day and let her check shit out. She will definitely be pleased. She is very opinionated about a lot in my life and will always pull her own version of "tell it like it is" moments. But she is the biggest sweetheart and supports me in my endeavors even though she is very protective of me when it comes to men and does not take kindly to them being asses or doing anything that could hurt me. (Love ya G.) Sweetheart indeed.

      This weekend was pretty busy, but turned out to be quite fun. Friday night I went and met a friend I hadn't seen in quite some time at this gallery down in Parkdale. She was co-hosting this spoken word night with another local who was showcasing his most recent photographs. Invite only, open bar, lots of pretentious people mixed with some who were just cool as shit. I didn't get too wasted and turned down the opportunity to land face down in a snowbank. Just browsed and listened and met good people with whom I had great conversations. And... I met a boy. He is a friend of the photographer and is really hot, intelligent, artistic, sarcastic, witty, and fun. He isn't much of a drinker and doesn't really do any drugs besides smoke weed - what a rare and refreshing change that is, well compared to the people I know and usually meet anyways. No cheesy come-ons, just talking and connecting. I haven't connected with someone in too long, it was nice. He was really sweet and flattering and made me feel good (unlike so many in my life). There are just those people you meet that you can look at and know that they are possible relationship material, good quality they are. I call them A-List people. Then there are those who are good for nothing more than a night or act only as fillers, a distraction in between the good ones: B-List people. He appears to be of the A-List variety. I have just recently cut all strings with a B-List person which feels damn good - distraction no longer required. This is potentially the perfect time for an A-List to come into my life. I'll have to get to know him better though before I can come to any conclusions on the matter.  Saturday night was a friend's birthday so we all went out to Mod Club for the brit pop/retro night. Such a good club. I pretty much always have a great time when I go there. Again... I refrained from shoveling anything up my nose - and drinks were in moderation. No sloppy messes to clean up or random pieces to try to put back together. Just fun and dancing and laughing with good people. I was home and in bed by 3am. This gave me quite a bit of satisfaction.  Yesterday we had a few people over at our house for drinks and a bbq. The weather was gorgeous. I got a bit too drunk and woke up in the middle of the night still dressed, half on the couch and half falling off. I don't remember how I got there or events leading up to my passing out. Oh well, one night out of three isn't bad. And I'm not feeling too hungover today. As simple and basic as this might be, I realize I like waking up at a somewhat reasonable hour and not feeling like absolute shit. Wow, what a revelation... I must deserve some kind of reward for that one. ;)  I feel good about myself and my decisions this weekend. I feel good that I met cool new people who may end up playing a prominent role in my life in the future. I feel good about baggage that I no longer am carrying the weight of. I feel good about having taken a deep breath and deciding to let go of many things that have been weighing me down and people that have been hurting me and taking me for granted. I'm grasping desperately now for a way to have a fresh start and a fresh outlook without having to skip the country - this weekend, on several levels, has given me a shred of hope that this may be possible. I'm not speaking of quitting drugs or drinking completely, it's not just about substances, it's about perspective. Now I'm just afraid that I'll slip and fall again like I have too often in the past.  I'm feelin' alright...
