      Well, I spent the night at my friend James' house last night. But during the night a couple of the older young men in our ward came and brought us over to Ben's house and we tried the gallon challenge... If you don't know what that is you probably don't want to try it... It's crud... I'll try it again sometime becauseI know I can do it evenutally. But anyways, you take a gallon of milk and with in 1 hour you have to drink the whole thing... I got so close... It was frustrating. I had like one glass left in the jug and that was it! Then I threw up... I think I won because I was the last to throw up but maybe Ben won because he got about half a glass more in than I did. Well, girls I guess do each others hair and talk about guys and guys sit there and drink milk until we throw up... Sounds like there is a major IQ difference. I feel real dumb but I know I can do it next time.  Anyways, it is getting extremely hot... Yesterday in my hometown in reached close to 107*. It's supposed to reach 103 today and that was the forcast for yesterday. So who knows. Not having air conditioning really sucks in weather like this. At least I have friends that do so I can just crash at their place, or go to like one of the 5 public pools in the area.   So I guess you can sum this all up in a few words... Throwing up isn't really fun and hot weather sucks! I'm such a genious... yeah the same genious that drinks milk until his stomach is about to rupture. Idiot.   I really want to go and see Napoleon Dynomite. My friends have all seen it and rave about it. It looks good. The director and the main character are LDS. I need to go see it.  My friend that I spent the night with last night was telling me this really funny pick up line. You go up to the person and ask them if you wrote down your number, would they hold it in their hand all night. If they say yes, you write down the number on your hand... Hehehe... Fo' shizzle. Anyways, a day in the life of Anders.  Tab, I miss you so much! -Andrew

      Well it's peaking 100 degrees out side right now.   I'm excited for next week. Thursday through Saturday I will be rafting the Dechutes river in Oregon. I'm excited, time for a tan! lol... Yeah, one in Oregon that lasts 3 months and then it starts raining and you get white at ever again. But I'll post some pictures later when I get them developed. So next week I'll only post on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday. In between I'll be dead silent. Tryin not to fall off my raft.  Anyways,  O'doyle Rules!!!

      Well today from 9-4:30 I was helping someone move. It was tough they had a lot of heavy stuff... Two elders on their P-day help us. My friend Scott and I made 10 bucks an hour for it anyways... I thought I was doing it for service at first but then the lady handed me the money telling me it was a paying job, guess I didn't hear that part when I told them I'd help.  Well I did have a picture of Tab posted on the blog, but her dad was uncomfortable with it being on there... Which is totally understandable... I just feel like a complete idiot now. I think I screwed up... Of course I took it of immediatly. I haven't heard from her very much today... That and I've been gone almost all day.   Goin to see a movie tomorrow w/ my bro, mom and Scott... Should be fun.

      Well I think I pretty much sorted out the argument that I had with my bro today. I had him read my previous entry. Things have been better since. &nbsp; Recently I have been listening to an artist named "Kalai". If you haven't heard of him before now you have and you should do something about it, because he is amazing. Songs that I would recommend are "On my mind", "It Passed" and "Divide Me"... The three are slow songs that are just plain awesome. Totally recommended to anyone that enjoys accoustic music. I want to get his name out because he'll make the charts if he is. &nbsp; I've got a friend that I'm really concerned about. I'll leaver her name as Linda. But she recenty moved to the East Coast with no friends to recieve her and is dealing with severe depression right now, she goes on&nbsp; about dying and suicide and it's got me worried sick. By my nature I feel like I'm doctor Phil and can fix everyones problems but I know I can't and I don't know what I can do. I've tried a number of things. I'd feel like I've failed if she took her own life. She is really close... I told her to dial a hotline or something... Anything because people are out there that love her... I feel like it's going to happen anyways... &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Well this morning my brother and I got in an argument. I love him to death but I'm just so concerned for him. He's really struggling. He has so much potential but he just doesn't use it. I've told him that but I don't think he took it to heart. I guess I'm overreacting, because when I was his age I was starting to make a change, I mean I actually made my heart want to change what I was doing, and I have. Now I am a way better person. Coming out of my depression was tough but I did it. With him, he may not be dealing with depression but some of the issues he has exposed to other people greatly effect how they see him. It's hurts so much to see him not wanted sometimes among his friends. I feel like the bad guy a lot because sometimes I'll try to use that against him to try and get him to change. But it doesn't work and we both end up getting hurt. These issues just haven't hit his heart yet and I'm waiting for them to. I had my epiphany before he has and I just feel like I need to help because the sooner the change happens the better his life will be and I can testify of that, because I've seen it... But no matter how much I tell him that it seems to go in one ear and out the other. &nbsp; Sorry Phillip, just let me know if I can help... I really to love you Bud.

      Well I checked my email, and Tab says she read my entry from Sunday. I guess she liked it, but she said it almost made her cry a couple of times. Of course that wasn't my intent. It's only because I think the world of her and express it. &nbsp; I love you Tabitha!

      Well,  &nbsp;  I talked with Tabitha for about half an hour last night. I slept really good, hearing her voice allows me to miss her less so that it easier. I feel closer somehow, which is what I wish could really happen. J and I had talked about making a road trip up there to visit her and do some other stuff, but my parents being who they are were a little reluctant to let J and I drive 5-6 hours to visit her. If they only knew who Tabitha was to me. I've never liked a girl like I've liked her. With other girls it was always a little kid&nbsp;"crush" or something like that, even if the girl and I got into a relationship. Even up until May with my last&nbsp;relationship.&nbsp;But with Tab, there is a huge difference. I feel a sense of maturity in it. I feel like because she isn't as close to me as I'd like I literally feel like a piece of my heart isn't there. I've never felt that before. So at the same time as I like it, I also hate it. I just hope this long-distance thing will keep going until I see her again.  &nbsp;  Tab and I began to talk about visits last night and we decided it would be cool to go to a school dance because then my parents would be more open to letting me go. I think they know Tabitha is a big deal. Everybody does. I can't stop talking about her. My friends are annoyed. But I bet if they met an angel they wouldn't stop either. I just feel so lucky. Everybody who knows me, knows who Tabitha is.  &nbsp;  Yes of course I feel physically distant, but emotionally and spiritually we just automatically clicked. From that point on we've just continued to get a lot closer. And that's awesome.  &nbsp;  Anyways, that's enough for now. I might write more later.

      I've just started this blog, it sounded like an okay idea to do.&nbsp;A way to open up &nbsp; I'm a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, otherwise known as LDS, or Mormon. I'm 16 years old and as part as being a youth in my church had a chance to go to what is called EFY, (Especially for Youth). The reason people go to this is you always come back a better person, wanting to change the world and make difference. But the food and girls are nice too. &nbsp; And on the topic of girls while I was there I was in one of my classes with my friend J. 2 girls walked into the room and he tells me that the 2 girls are in his group. One of them immediatly catches my attention. I tell J that he  has  to introduce me to them. I sit through the class occasionally looking onto the other side of the room. Okay, okay... so it was more than occasionally. The class ends and we head out. I can't stop reminding J that we need to get introduced.  &nbsp; That same day we had try-outs for a Variety Show that was going to be on Thursday (this was Tuesday). I'm planning to play piano for this thing. They had an okay piano in there, it was a Kawai Baby Grand. But, it was horribly out of tune. So I go to sit down. Through the door walks this girl again. She comes and sits down across from me. The auditions continue, and a group of 4 guys from Virginia do their act... The people who select who is in the show had us (being every body else but the 4 Virginians) stand out side the door. I sort of try to slip near her, while her friend is all excited about finding out how to use a calling card so she could call her boy-friend. I started messing around back there, and we began to talk as a group. I was the only guy and there were about 5 girls. Course I was focusing on only one. Tabitha, which I learn is her name, takes out the stuff she needs. Turns out she is going to do Irish Dancing, which I think is awesome. She goes out and stretches and then we are let back in the room and she trys out. She's really good at it, and I think I over did it telling her that as many times as I did before she left.  &nbsp; She left right before my piece on the piano because her friend Arin wanted to go use the phone card she just found out how to use. So I play my piece and I don't mess up at all so I was really excited about it. I then went back to the cafeteria to eat. I then go do what I need to for the rest of the day until I have to get ready for the dance that night. I get ready, and escort a girl from my group over to the building. For a good few hours I'm just messing around with the guys from my dorm and it got really hot in there. I, during a slow song, eventually scan for someone to dance with. I walk by and meet eyes with Tabitha. She points at me and wiggles her finger to have me come over. So I do and we dance, and it rocked. I don't even remember what song it was the whole time I'm just paying attention to her. The dance ends and I tell her that hopefully we could dance a second time. I go back to the guys and start messing around again. The dance continues and each slow song I walk by only to either not be able to find her, or some other guy already did. So eventually the last song comes by, and I find her alone. Ask her if I can have the dance and we dance. She asked what classes and stuff I was going to the next day... I told her I which ones I was thinking of... and while I was talking I just kind of though "Wait a minute!" and asked her if she wanted to go to them together. She said "totally". So it was time to leave. I went back to my dorms and started talking to my friend Garrett that I'm going to classes with Tabitha the next day.  &nbsp; So, on Wednesday Tabitha and I went to classes together and just went everywhere together. During lunch 2 guys my age had saxophones and I sat down at the piano and we began to play together. We ended up getting a decent sized audience.We began to talk later&nbsp;and I asked her if she wanted to go to the Banquet and Dance on Friday. She said yes. Later that night while the 2 girls were in their dorm J and I ran to it. It was dark, so we went outside of their window. I picked up some pebbles and tossed them at the window. Arin and Tab opened it up and Joel and I talked to them for a while. &nbsp; On Thursday the Young Men and Young Women split up to each do their own thing. I sat with her at Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner that day. During Lunch her and I went again to the piano they had in the cafeteria that I had played on the day before. It was already taken, so I asked her if she wanted to go for a walk. Her and I had such an awesome talk. We got to know each other a little more. I explain some problems I was dealing with in my family and she did to. I being the cry baby I am began to cry. After we finished her and I began to walk around again and I told her that she didn't have to say "yes" to me asking her out to Friday nights activities. She said that she knew but she wanted to. I asked why and she said that she thought it would be fun. I asked her if she knew why I asked her. She said no. I told her it was because I liked her. She said "That's good, because I like you too". I couldn't believe it. I just said,   "You're serious?!?"    "Yeah"   "Oh my gosh, you don't even know, that is so awesome."  (She got red in the face and laughed)  "I'm not trying to like soften you up or anything but you seriously the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. I thought I didn't have a chance with you."   "But just to let you know, I don't want to have a whole boyfriend-gir...."   "I totally understand, I was just about to say the same thing. It'd be dumb to start something have it pretty much end Saturday morning."   "Yeah"   So after my excitement died down the day followed through with an amazing night. We had some meetings with our own groups so she was with hers.   &nbsp; On Friday the day went through and we did pictures and stuff. My friend Garrett and I tried to sing a couple of songs for her during free time. I messed up horribly on both of them but she said she liked it a lot. So we went to the banquet later, unfortunetly we had to escort and eat with someone from our group, which I didn't really know before. So when I had finished eating I walked over to where she was sitting and sat down. We then went to the dance later. So we messed around and I immediatly went out to go find her. We danced all but 2 of the songs because plenty of guys were trying to go and ask her. During the middle of the dance I went and dedicated a song to her. Nobody heard it over the noise of the crowd but I told her what the DJ said. "This is to Tabitha, from Andrew Barnes... He just wanted to thank you for the best week of his life." Of course I heard it because I was paying super close attention. So danced and it was really cool. Then at the end of the dance I had Arin take pictures of both of us. The first one I just put my arm around her but the second is of me with her in my arms after I had picked her up. She kind of screamed and I laughed because she wasn't expecting it. I haven't even got my pictures developed though. I need to get that done. &nbsp; So anyways, the girls left the dance first this time after Garrett and I and a few friends sung songs to them as they left. Later, Tyler, David, Kevin, Sam, another guy I didn't know and I went and snuck out to her window and again I threw some rocks at her window (I had been doing it all week so she knew immediately that it was me) so we ran to the window. I told her to open it, and when she did the guys and I sung a Harmonized version of "You are my sunshine". It turned out great. I was so happy. Almost every window on that side of the Dorm hall was opened so they could listen. I told Tab to have a good night and went to my dorm. I went to bed. &nbsp; On Saturday I got up really early and went outside and sat and waited for her. I eventually found her and she was wrapped up into this huge blanket... Her, J, Arin and I went over to a tree and just talked. My mom pulled up, and I put my stuff in the car. I came back and gave her a hug, it was really cold outside but she opened up her blanket and we hugged and then I walked to my car. It was one of the hardest things I've done. Then I drove 3 hours back home. It seemed like a whole day... I missed her so much already. &nbsp; This last week I went to a ward campout and my friends and I messed around and had a good time. I'm just thinkin about Tabitha the whole time and my friends get annoyed. Saturday I come back and find my inbox with 20 emails in it. 3 or 4 of them are from her. I write an email to her telling her how much I miss her and how much I felt about her. I told her that the night before I was listening to a song by an artist named Kalai. It was a song called "It Passed" It was about him leaving when he really didn't want to but had to and I just started to cry. I have always been a cry baby. But Tabitha is like perfect, she is everything I've always dreamed about.   Now I'm at home writing this super long entry detailing my past few weeks. And Tabitha is 5 hours away. In a place I won't be able to visit for quite a long time. I don't know when I'll be able to see her again. I just hope I will and it will be sooner than later.&nbsp;She says is going to call tonight, and my day rests on whether I hear from her or not. My day is so much better when I do. &nbsp; Thanks Tabitha, -Andrew &nbsp;

      Well from Thursday I and some friend a long with some of the youth leaders in my ward went out to the Dechutes River for white water rafting. We started rafting on Friday, rafting from 9am-4pm. During that day there was a cliff that we were able to jump off. People were saying it was anywhere from 50-60 feet. It was the longest fall that I've ever taken. I did that twice and then jumped off a lower rock into the water.  On Saturday we hit a class 4+ rapid. Class 6 is considered impassible and for a matter of fact there is a class 6 rapid further on down the river from where they have you pull off the river. The people there were saying that there is a 30 foot water fall there. I think that's pretty impassible.  Anyways, I had a blast got pretty sundburned and I finally got my EFY pictures... I'm such a slacker.

      ... Lately I've been sorta attracted to one girl... but this is in the midst of all other kinds of things that makes it just a whole load of fun for my mind to retrace over and over. Shes in my ward and I've known her for a lil' while. Turns out though that as far as I know, my friend likes her and she likes him back. Another girl in my ward is obsessed with me and is best friends with the girl that I like. So if anyone found out that I liked this girl a number of people might end up getting hurt. As far as I know, I'm positive she doesn't like me. It'd be cool if she did. Her and I walked on the beach for an hour and a half on wednesday and she said a few things that kind of hinted towards stuff. We had a nice long chat though. I dunno where this is gonna go or anything, but she's really cool... BUT! she's only 14. Yeah I know... 2 years younger than me. Still doesn't change who she really is though, and that's what I'm attracted to. Ta-

      ...So I decided to write. Unfortunetly I don't have much to write about... Other than James Dalton is a girl. And needs to sort out his sexual preferences.  I went the beach on Wednesday and to the temple later that night. Good day over all. Tuesday I'm going to Punch Bowl falls to go cliff jumping. I'm really excited, I've got a lot of people coming... anyways...
