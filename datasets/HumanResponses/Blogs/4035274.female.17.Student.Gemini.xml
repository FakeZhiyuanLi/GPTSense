       Only three days, three very long days. Its never been lost on me how the closer you get to something the farther away it seems. This always vividly strikes me when I'm walking home from the busstop on hot or frigid days when the closer I get to the end of the block the further it seems to travel, as if the houses are multiplying just to spite me. With only three days to go It seems like everyday consists of 48 hours, like every hour is made up of 120 minutes, and each minute is made up of 120 seconds. I'd do the math but I'm going to estimate I just made the day about 16x longer. So now I'm doing stupid things to pass the time like...watching TV. Do you know how much crap is on TV? 600 and some odd channels, and there's only about one&nbsp;I can stomach. Ah the Space channel, home of Farscape, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Star Trek...but since I've seen every episode of Star Trek there is to see it no longer amuses me. Channel surfing is one of those things that makes time tick more slowly, and yet I find myself doing it anyway. I could...read a book, only I've read four +400 page novels in the past month, I'm going to run out soon. I could write...I  should  write, I mean I want to finish my novella but my muse is taking a small vacation. Ah the sweet computer...hold on, nothing to do here either with Chris off in his own little world and Mandeep off being the social butterfly she is, so it seems only logical that I would simply put down my thoughts on..."paper."    Its only 3:30 pm. I've been awake only&nbsp;4 and 1/2&nbsp;hours, God almighty I need a hobby. Suddenly being so bored I'll go take a nap isn't cutting it anymore, but then again, I only have three days, three lousy days before time speeds up on me. With relatives coming up from Bermuda and Simon coming home there won't be hours in the day to appease everyone or get anything done and before I know it school will be back, but I've never been the kind of person to bitch and complain about going to school, its a welcome diversion from my crazy home life, my crazy love life, my crazy friendships. So I say, bring it on, finally taking subjects I  want  to take, this year should prove interesting at least...(although odds are I'll get&nbsp; Ms. I-have-something-up-my-ass "Good"man for world history) Its sort of unnerving knowing, this is it, my last year of highschool, where have the last three years gone? They were a blink. While I have girlfriends already gearing up for prom as if its the defining point of their lives, I'm thinking "I spent the last three years being a vegitable, and I want to go out in style." Its very much like me to save everything for the last second, if I get the nerve to do it at all. Magazine editor? As if I have the perserverance to do it...Amnesty International? As if I have the compassion...Yearbook photo editor? As if I have the credentials...Softball MVP? Don't even go there, I'm still fuming about last year. All these things I've wanted to accomplish and still have time for friends, for Simon, for homework, for art and softball and just having the time to sit and be me for a second, its a little overwhelming, its a little much considering the past three years have been just a blink. Who has the time anymore?     Oh wait, I do. I have all the time in the world (and I'm just&nbsp;waiting for it to pass.)

       Today I was basically accused of being egotistical for wanting to play my normal position for softball. "Maybe its you Alex, maybe you suck and your ego is too big." Is it&nbsp;just me,&nbsp;or did&nbsp;kicking someone while they're down become cool lately? I've been getting a lot of it. I feel like nice guys do finish last, like I'm being kicked in the head by someone I trust. The worst part is, it makes you wonder, am I really an egotistical jerk? Am I like that, do people hate me? Bloody hell, the paranoia it takes control. And I answer myself, "no no Alex, you're not like that." Really?   Meanwhile I just got an email from AJ begging me to talk to him again, in contrast to the previous dilemma it makes me think "Am I a pushover and let people walk on me b/c I'm trying to be nice to them?" Really? Bullshit, I'm not going to forgive him for him, I'm forgiving him for me. I'm using him and I'm disgusted with myself for it. Sometimes I worry he loves me as much as Simon does, but at the same time its so good (in an evil way) to know someone out there who loves&nbsp; me that I don't love back. Knowing that there's someone out there who will literally beg me just to talk to him as if I'm someone worth begging for. Yeah bloody right. Nobody's stuck by him, its my own damn fault for being that somebody who did, now I have this power and I'm a slave to it. Maybe I'm the succubus in my story.   Speaking of Simon, he's finally coming back in five days! I'm so happy, yes at least something&nbsp;still makes me happy. Plenty of things do...Mandeep, Chris, music...my camera...Right. Hopefully he'll call tonight so&nbsp;I can tell him about this whole bloody mess (I really like that word "bloody"), I could use his support. I need someone to ease my fears and forgive me for being the awful whore I am.
