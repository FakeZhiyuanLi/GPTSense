      This is my first Blog, and it will be dedicated to the first book in my Necrophobia series, "The Silver Light." This novel is already completed, so I will not be adding any new posts to it, but simply record the whole book in one sitting. Enjoy.

           XVI   Longing    The flight was as a dream, filled with love and laughter. Helsing bore the small troupe over hills and plains all day with little disturbance. They did skirmish with the two harpies who had escaped, but Tali deftly shot them from the sky, skewering them on the same arrow. At dusk, they landed in a forest for the night.   The tent was set; the canteens were filled; Helsing’s scales were shined. All that remained was to build a fire. As Tali’s golden cat eyes were specialized to see in the deepest shadows, she went alone to get the wood. Helsing flew to rest on a high cloud so as to keep a better vigil for harpies and their slaves. Kazoran entered the tent and lay down on his pallet.   He was madly in love with that nymph. She was everything he had wanted and needed during those lonely years in his father’s citadel in the Glade. There was nothing he desired more than to spend the rest of his life with her. How much longer must he wait to marry her and truly be one?     ¤¤¤   The witch had seen them coming, the nymph, the wyvern. All that interested her was the man. The beautiful man. The witch was an elf with eternal youth: youth that was bitterly spent alone in these woods. Few people had ever come into the forest. The witch longed for someone to love. She gathered her potions and summoned the nightshade.   ¤¤¤   Tali was mewing to herself contentedly. Chopping wood with her sharp claws, the nymph listened to the sounds of the forest. Suddenly, her ears erected. Something was moving. Something big. Kazoran was all alone at the camp. Talli dropped the kindling and ran. Hold on Kazi!   ¤¤¤  The nightshade was enormous. It was black as the deepest shadow in the ocean’s depths. Its eyes alone glowed red. It continued to lunge at Kazoran with lethal claws. Kazoran parried, lunged, and dodged with the Vorpal Sword. Yet the beast’s thick, armor-like skin deflected every blow. The creature’s size prevented it from matching the bard’s speed, but Kazoran was using much more energy than the nightshade was and would also tire before the monster. It occurred to him that the nightshade did not want him dead. It attacked with purpose, but did not use its full strength. Well, it wouldn’t have him. Eventually, the nightshade tired of the game and flicked the blade from Kazoran’s hand. It pressed him down under its giant claw and began to draw him deeper into the forest…   "Stop!" cried Tali bounding in front of the nightshade. "Sit. Release. Heel." The beast obeyed without a word, letting go of Kazoran and sitting as a docile dog might do for an owner it had known since puppyhood. Kazoran stood and pulled Tali close.   "Stop!" The cry rang through the forest a second time. The elf-witch materialized from behind a tree in the shadows. "I have lived alone in these woods for a millennia! My eternal youth has been lonely and ill spent. The bard comes with me, to love and cherish me."   To this, the nymph beast master had but one thing to say, and it was not to the witch. "Fetch."

      Hey! This is a blog for all of my poetry. At first, I thought I might  include a lot my poetry from years past but decided at last that they were just a little too ammature for my taste. This section will be updated with only new poems, written from Friday, August 13, 2004 and beyond. As in all of my sections, feel free to leave comments if a poem really speaks to you.

       Today I was asked to give a devotional at FCA tomorrow morning. It's hard to think of exactly what I want to say, but I think I've found the subject I want. Remember the verse in the bible where Jesus talks about when someone strikes you on one cheek, you should turn to let him strike the other? I have a lot of experience with this subject (literally and figuratively... ouch). This passage doesn't neccessarily mean that you should go around letting people slap you. I do have a friend who does that to me on occasion physically, though. What it does mean is we should not seek revenge. We should give people what they ask of us (unless, in my opinion, it is harmful to them). As Christians, whe will constantly be expected to be different by both other Christians and non-Christians alike. Not flying off the handle every time someone is mean to us is one way we can portray that God can make a change in your life.      I've been persecuted a lot in my life, whether or not it was for being a Christian. I've found that whenever I get mad and get even, the problem gets worse, and more people become involved in the squabble. But when I "turn the other cheek," someone always seems to notice, and wants to know what I have that can let me take teasing, tormenting, and physical violence.       When we do what God tells us is right, and we do it for the right reasons, it will make amazing changes in our lives and in the lives of people around us. Try it some time and you'll see what I mean.       Godspeed,

        Ever had a secret? Like, one you never told anyone? Secrets range from never telling anyone you wet the bed until you were nine (Eww...), to not talking to your crush, to keeping the fact that your uncle hits you everyday locked up inside. Secrets can make you feel either really independent or really alone in the world.      The first type of secret i named is the trivial kind. It doesn't matter if anyone knows, the secret is just embarrassing or maybe just better kept to yourself. It doesn't hurt anyone to keep that kind of secret, and there wouldn't really be any point in telling. Just go ahead and keep those to yourself.      The second is a bit trickier. This kind of secret can go both ways as to how dangerous it is. If your crush already has a boyfriend or girlfriend, it would rude to tell them you like them. It won't kill you; you won't care about them in a week anyway. If there is no reason not to tell them, though, and you have liked that person for a long time and for a good reason, I think you ought to tell them. Who knows, you might even get a date out of it.       The last is the most painful and most concrete secret. If you are being hurt, especially if you are being threatened, it probably causes you pain to talk about. Despite threats and hurts though, someone should know if something that serious is wrong. You owe it to yourself and everyone else to take care of the problem.      It can be fun to see how long you can keep secrets. Just make sure that keeping them is worth the pain it might cause.        -Hunter M.

       What is the thing you fear the most? I know that I for one am never satisfied with my physical appearance and am always afraid of being embarrassed, and even though I am generally pretty outgoing and love attention, I'm afraid that someone will reject me or what I have to say because of how I look. These kinds of fears are even worse than regular types, like fears of spiders, snakes, and heights. The reason is that they are the types of doubts that encourage dangerous behaviors, eating disorders, depression, and even keeping you from making a stand or saying what you believe, which is in my opinion the most dangerous consequence.      Even more common fears, like being afraid of the dark, can be just as dangerous. They still keep us from doing things and living life. A person who lets a fear of the water control them would never enjoy a day at the beach and could never save a friend who was drowning. A chlaustrophobic person may be too afraid to take a subway or drive on a crowded road (which, while not dangerous, is an inhibiting inconvienience). You get my drift.      The important thing to remember about fear and courage is that fears are natural but shouldn't ever be allowed to dominate us. And don't forget that courage ISN'T the absence of fear, just a state of overcoming fear to do what is best for others.       -Hunter M.

       I've been thinking a lot lately about trying to be something you aren't. You know, "Ugly Duckling Syndrome." These days, everyone seems to be masquerading a little too much lately. And, even worse, they seem to be stepping out from behind the mask as something I never imagined them to be. Not that it's a bad thing (well, not all the time), but so often things are different once we realize that our brethren were never really one of us. Or, rather, we were never one of them. When they turn out to be so much more complex and beautiful than we ever knew, we are humbled that we ever doubted them. Yet all too often I've found that people were much uglier inside than I had deemed them.  Some of us have an awful tendency to conceal so much of what we are to find another part of us that we know isn't there. What we are REALLY doing is just trying to impress someone, or fit in when we know that if someone cared about us, they would accept us for what we are. All these little games we play only complicate things, especially when we didn't know we were playing a game, or, worse, when we knew but didn't care.  Not feeling accepted or loved is one of the worst feelings in the world. Believe me, I know. Still, it's worse to feel like the only reason anybody cares about you is because you are being what they tell you too.     Keeping it real, Hunter M.

       Let's face it: very few people on the face of the planet understand what love really is. That doesn't stop millions of people of all ages from saying "I love you" every day. I'm just as guilty as everyone else for telling people that I loved them after only going out for a week, but do you honestly believe you could know that in such short a time. Seriously, most middle school dating is just farce: a way to feel mature about something or feel like maybe someone cares about you. Maybe you do love that person as much as you say, but chances are that at this stage in your life, you don't. Especially if your relationship is based on making out in someone's attic.      The reason I'm harping about this today is because this hits close to home for one of my good friends. She has been dating a boy for months, maybe close to a year now, and those three small words are becoming a bigger and bigger problem. There relationship had a heavy foundation in-- you guessed it-- the physical, and not near enough attention was paid to the spiritual and emotional concepts of it. Now my friend wants to feel more in love, but her boyfriend just seems to be getting tired of the relationship, and she feels less loved now than before they started going out. The really sad part is that this kind of thing goes on every day because people who don't understand love still abuse it.       I guess its hard to tell, when you really do care about someone, whether you really love them or not. It's all too obvious that you do not love someone when the relationship wears thin. I know that, in my relationships, a lot of hearts have been broken over the things that we said and the things that we did because, in the end, it was nothing, and it was nearly impossible to mend a friendship after a break-up. Sometimes it really was impossible.      I guess I'm just trying to say if you really think you love someone, at least love them enough to make sure you don't ever hurt them on purpose.       With "love,"

       Well, today was strangely lucky, considering both that I am the most unlucky person I know and the date. I finally got this page set up, and i went to Lauren's sleep-over party. (It was about ten girls and me, I did not actually sleep over; I left around 10:30, you perv.) Some of my friends were ferociously angry with me before tonight, but for no apparant reason they have taken it into their heads to forgive me. Not that I'm complaining. Things are looking up, but, knowing me, I'll screw it up soon enough. Better enjoy it while it lasts.      This is my first web page I have ever designed (for myself) and today is its maiden voyage. Maybe the date is an omen to how this site will work, but as long as at least a few of my friends read along, it will be worth it. This section, if you didn't notice yet is my online journal, where I talk about me and what I think is important. Live with it. Everyone else does.      Sorry there wasn't much to say today... maybe tomorrow something either so horrible or so great will happen that you will care about this section at all. Haha, leave a note under "comments" if there is anything worth talking about in this first entry.       -Hunter M.
