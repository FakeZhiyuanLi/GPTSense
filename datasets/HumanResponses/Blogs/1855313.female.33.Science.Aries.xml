      That's what's wrong with me.  I expect too much from people.   I realize how "oh so stupid" the following comment is~  I expect people to be nice when I am nice to them.  I expect people to be respectful if they are treated in kind.  *hangs head*  I have been doing it wrong all these years. I had my self talked into being a good person, and doing good things so that the universe would bring good people and good things to me.  I don't think it works that way~ I should never expect the good things in return.   I should give myself the good things. It's not up to some unseen force to treat me well~  It's like being Santa. Who gives Santa presents? I know, you are thinking "Mrs. Claus & the Elves... DUH!" Sure, they can give Santa nice things... But only Santa knows what Santa REALLY wants. And even if Santa tells Mrs. Claus what he REALLY wants~  Her own agenda may stop her from actually delivering. So~ If Santa really wants what he REALLY wants, then the only way he's sure to get it... Is to give it to himself!  Think about it!  I see nothing wrong with presenting myself with... presents. *blinks*  Oh, it can't be that simple... It just can't...

      Today I sat and listened to yet another person tell me how everything that goes wrong in my life is just simply "my fault" I wonder how it is that I personally am responsible for everyone's actions.    *shaking head*  I must be the most powerful  bitch on this fucking rock!   I guess my realization is that my job is to be the "big bad nasty"  in everyone's world.  *laughs*   If you met me on the street I am sure you would breathe a little sigh and say "wow" as I walked by~  Never guessing that my true nature is pain and destruction.  *You know the type. Pretty, Smart, Friendly, generous and really treats people the way she would want to be treated.. the kind of girl you secretly hate?*   And chances are, you will want to tear me down to your level. Just to feel better about your hateful little existence.  Oh who cares if you are offended~ you are sitting there thinking "no wonder people don't like you"  See, that's where you are wrong. People like me. They LOVE me.. Desire me.. want to make me their own little adoring love bunny...  Trouble is, I have a brain~  I can't sit by while people treat me like shit and not speak up. I was taught to say "hey! I deserve more respect than that!"  and you know what? People hate me for it.  I have this incurable sense of thinking that I should be treated nicely if someone claims to love me! (go figure)  I am not the wilting flower that just sits and says "oh gee honey, you had a bad day.. come treat me like shit so you can feel better"  No... I speak right up and call the injustice~!  and of course, I am immediately tagged for being a loudmouthed, self centered bitch. *yay on me*   People don't want honesty~ they don't want a friend that will listen to your heartbreak, be empathetic, supportive... Seriously.  You know what people want from me? They want me to sit prettily and agree with whatever they say~ I am to automatically spew what THEY want to hear out of my lucious lips~ Damn me all the way to the seventh level of hell for actually disagreeing or offering my opinion when asked.   See, it's a trick... when people ask you~ they don't really want you to answer, they want you to mirror what they have said. It's not enough to validate their thoughts~ you have to AGREE at all costs! OR DIE! *laughs*  Because I am a lovely woman I am here to make everyone feel better~   I am to hug you when you want a big fluffy hug!  *doesn't matter that you've been raking me over the emotional coals for hours, torturing me to make up for every woman that ever hurt you, HUG! NOW!!!!*  (oh, I'm sorry...what was I thinking... let me just flip this switch off in my brain~ you know the one that makes me visualize the psycho screaming and physical threatening as a BAD thing)  I am to agree with you trying to control your ex-husband!  *He was a bastard! How unfair~!  (uhm, you divorced him~ give it up already... if he didn't listen to you while he was legally bound to, why should he listen now? why would you let someone have that much power over your freedom? If you hated being married to him, why not just let the bastard wallow in his own horrible life and let go? You are just continuing to let him hurt you~ whatever~ knock yerself out!)  I am to sit quietly and smile~ while you make judgements about me having a girlfriend, while you are fucking a married man~   I should file my pretty nails while waiting for you to decide that our marriage is an actual top three priority!  (you know the top three, keep a job, be a good parent, be a good husband.... oh wait, you didn't get any of those other ones either)  You hate me because my kids don't try to burn the house down. They have manners and don't scream at their elders. It's called respect! Funny, but an awful person such as myself could NEVER have instilled such values by raising the child....    You hate me because I am polite to you, Because I respect you~ and try to help when you ask. You hate me because I try to be good to people.. but you can't get past feeling inferior so you must punish ME for it. You hate me because I work hard, and make more money than you do~  You hate me because I like to smile, and flirt... and have fun~ you know be light hearted and happy~   But I don't hate you~ I feel sorry for the ignorance and hate that guides your life. I'm not even angry with you... I am angry with me~ for allowing such a person to worm their way inside of my heart... I am angry with me for questioning my choice of walking the path of honesty, I am angry that I let my faith in myself falter because of what someone thinks I don't measure up. I do measure up~ and I won't lie to you. I will no longer bite back hurt, or happiness because it doesn't suit YOUR needs.

      She's somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. Of this I am fairly certain. Not like it's any of my business, mind you. She's her own woman, and proves that she can come and go as she pleases. I guess that's no different from my own behavior. Just that somehow.... I don't know... It's always been the two of us together.  I am taking the taste of my own medicine. It's a bitter batch, and I don't mind saying so. I went to Arizona for Thanksgiving. (Granted, this was after we broke up) and she was very upset about not wanting to be alone for the holidays (trying to guilt me? I wonder..) So I told her to go home. I guess she decided she had the funds after all.   Parting is such sweet sorrow.  Let's not forget J is gone too.  He administered his own toxic dose as well. I can't complain. Usually he is the one left behind to deal with the dynamic duo's traveling conquests. So he's been due to skip town.   I just can't get over the silence.  It's so still~  I slept like the dead last night.

      Ms. G,  I would like to take this moment to point out that what we are doing right now is dangerous and irresponsible.  Specifically, I refer to you reading this blog, and me reading yours. This behavior is totally unacceptable.   Please consider the facts, our involvement has proven to be completely out of the realm of sanity. Maintaining ANY sort of active bond is an act of emotional suicide. One example would be comparative to driving drunk with your eyes closed, guided only by your heart.    This is bound to self-destruct and bite us squarely in the arse.   Please note for future reference: I solemnly swear NEVER to read your blog again.   I mean it. I really do. Really-really.   Sincerely, Chieran

      Do yourself a favor... don't read this.  Well, it sounds as though your life is coming together nicely~ albeit the weather is really putting a cramp on your riding.   Spring is around the corner, and I'm sure Spike will have a new rider shortly. So don't miss my presence too much~    Yes,  I was weak and read your blog. No, this is the only blog that I have. No secret pages out there spilling my heart and soul.  Which leads me to say this.  The whole "I wonder if you even miss me" and "I guess you really have moved on"  Well, I hate to burst your private little bubble. But I do miss you.  *gasp* yes, I know, it's  a shock from the heartless bitch that you have come to embrace as my avatar.     Tur, do you want to know what I miss? Do you really?     I miss that first moment in the morning, where I would open my eyes and see you there beside me.  I miss feeling your little furry socks in bed at night.  I miss tickling you.... and hearing you laugh~ That dorky, horrible "ahyuk" sound you make.  I miss seeing sunshine in your hair.  I miss your emails in the morning... telling me about your night, and letting me know I am loved.  I miss your goofy little half-smile.  I miss your freckles.  I miss the way you would babble on the phone, about technical things that make no sense to me.  I miss listening to your heartbeat when you would hold me in your arms.  I miss tracing my fingers around your tattoo.  I miss the way you would smell after riding... sunshine and fresh air.  I miss feeling safe.  I miss watching you park your truck...badly.  I miss feeling you drive Spike... expertly.  I miss making breakfast for you.  I miss laughing uncontrollably about stupid shit.  I miss holding you when you cry.  I miss dreaming about our future, what our home would look like, daydreaming about you~ thirty years from now.  I miss so many things... too many to list.... all the little things that kept me coming back every time.       You already know the things I don't miss.       As for moving on... Well, I am trying.   But not like you suspect, I'm sure. I have personal Ads up, because I am trying to get my group back together~  so that I can have purpose to look at my computer and not instantly think about you.   I even went on a date~ thinking that would fix this constant facination my heart seems to have with you. I spent the whole evening thinking about how you would have loved the movie... and I missed you.  I've thrown myself into diet and exercise~ so that I have another focus.  I read. I clean. I talk to my old friends.      I keep re-living the happy moments~    The first time I told you I loved you, I can still feel the tears of joy....   The first ride on Spike.. how beautiful the moon was, drifting through the clouds. Our flights out to Virginia~ how you comforted my fears, just by being near... hearing your voice. Standing on the ferry in the morning sun, dreaming of how we would someday live in Washington. You, me and the boys. Watching the flying saucer while laying in the sunshine at the pool. Seeing where you grew up. You meeting my mom. The park in Denver. Your dad bringing me to the front of the church.   There is just so much... so many things... things that are embedded in my heart~ It kills me to know that I couldn't love you enough... couldn't show it enough to ease your fears... to take away your pain.   Trust is a bitch.  We don't have it... but I don't want to talk about why... we know why.  Right now I want to find a way to dig my heart out... to claw your very existence from my memory. But I can't. I exist day in, and day out... feeling the love I have always held for you... right along with the pain of losing you. I lost you a long time ago... I lost you before I even met you.

      Every once in a while something happens in life to remind us of why we make all the choices that bring us to our current moment in time.  A searing heat of longing, the painful grip of fear... any intense emotion that wounds our soul leaves a delicate scar.

       ~*~*From my Beautiful Friend K, sent to cheer me up :) *~*~   So I was pondering after last night and I was reading my 365 Tao Book and this reminded me of  you....   ~Sheaths~   Outside is form  Inside is thought  Deepest is the Soul....   Traditional sages describe a human being as having three sheaths. The outer one is the physical body and incorporates primitive drives and instincts. The inner one is the mind and includes discrimination, reasoning, and sense of individuality.     Both the body and the mind are enslaved to the outer world because they gain their knowledge from sensory input. They cannot know anything "tangible", anything without a form or a name.   At the core of every person is the soul. This is a pure , virgin self .It does not think in the ordinary sense of the word, has no egotism, and is not concerned with maintaining itself in the world. Although the body has a shape and the mind is multifaceted, the soul is completely without form or features. No markings, profiles, names, formulas, numbers, ideas or conceptions can be projected upon it. It is pure, shapeless, and empty.   Any person with training can reach the soul. Only then can you be convinced of its presence. When you reach it, your body and mind will become irrelevant, for you are now in a sate beyond the senses and beyond thought. The soul is called absolute because it is beyond all relativity.   When I saw this it made me think of you... because the  beauty that I see in you in within and I send you this in hopes  that  you see  how beautiful you are starting from that inner layer on out!  Have a wonderful day gorgeous!   ~*~*~My friends renew my heart when it's broken~*~*~

      So, I'm sitting here thinking about my weekend. I'm feeling pretty good about it, on the average. I got to spend some great time with my mom on Sunday... not to mention the ceremony I performed for my long time friend and teacher. And it's always grand spending time with Becky. *smiles*   On a non-related note, I feel like something terrible is coming.... But I think that just my anxiety about the party this weekend. Let's face it, last year's Mix Mash Bash ended miserably. *sigh* So, now I'm a tiny bit subdued about my expectations this year.  By subdued, I mean I'm trying hard not to expect tantrums. *winces* I guess we won't know until it's all said and done, hmmmm?   I'm also considering changing this blog location. By that, I mean... I'd rather my girlfriend not be available to read this blog. Too much pressure to tone down what I'm thinking. No solid decision there yet.   Work is ok, but I'm having a difficult time staying focused.   I am SO wiped out!!!! Damn I need some decent sleep... alone sleep... and quiet time... but there is so much to do....

      People think of it as such a horrible place to be.   Want to know what's worse? Not being able to allow yourself to be vulnerable.  Not having enough people you trust, really trust... with your feelings.  I was raised by the stern hand of a very demanding, emotionally withdrawn and independent woman. My mother was raised by horrible, HORRIBLE people... and therefore never trusted anyone, after a life of failed love attempts, she chose to be alone. She tried like hell to raise me in her own image, and for the most part she succeeded.    I have learned through the years that there are people who make a lifetime out of being victims and living in a constant state of vulnerability. I generally refer to them as being "needy". I don't feel comfortable with being subjected to this level of their personal pain. I've been programmed into being in control of my feelings 24/7... I don't get comfort, why should I give my security blankie to someone else? I need it dammit! Grow up and get your own!  This becomes a recurring problem because I'm a horrible judge of character. I try to scope out people that display fairly secure personality traits.  What I end up with is a collection of borderline personalities that should be headlining on Broadway, what will all the drama and acting skills. Ever wonder how people can cry on cue? I've seen it~ and..... I still don't know how it works.    I keep valiantly trying to find a person that's strong enough to handle life when I temporarily fall apart. (I can't carry everything all the time, hell... I don't want to! Help me for once, dammit!)  I always hear how I'm the strongest person anyone has ever met... I believe it's true.  I'm tired. Totally worn out.

I re-read my post and I'm wondering if I should tone it down a bit. *sigh* I just hate doing that.   The whole thing that started the shit-storm was that (less than a DAY of the kids being here) she had a tantrum and said she was "left out" now.. how I managed to leave her out of anything I just don't know. She and I took the boys to Wal-Mart the night we all got back, she was at the house until bedtime, and when she woke up the next day she came over before work.

Good points indeed... but it's not like I'm totally non-affectionate with her. I walked right up and kissed her, held her hand... kept my arm around her. I just keep it to a minimum. I don't feel comfortable forcing the kids to deal with it immediately. I want them to settle in before they have to deal with the thought that their mother is in the other room sleeping with another woman. But I kiss her and hug her. No, I don't make out with her, but I don't make out with J either. I'm just in mommy mode, that's all. I don't feel like a passionate creature unless the time and place is right. Especially not in front of  my kids.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----Original Message----- From: R Sent: Monday, June 21, 2004 11:25 AM To: C  Subject: RE: ya know what,..  Maybe she's looking for that affirmation of some grand gesture in front of the kids to cement her "importance" to you, as J's is, because you had agreed to raise the kids together, of course, not being a parent yet herself, may not recognize the effect on the kids...or be able to think in those terms.

Well, I'm tired of constantly having to come up with said "grand gesture" so as to affirm her position in my life.    In fact, she's supposed to be figuring out how to give herself comfort and stop placing that all on me. *according to her therapist* But she refuses to do so.    As for having hetero folks, it's true. She does. As well as the fact that her mother left when she was coming into her adolescent stages. She feels abandoned. This is where she starts re-playing the twisted little "mommy" tune into our relationship.    Do I have your permission to quote these emails in my blogger? Your points are extremely valid.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----Original Message----- From: R  Sent: Monday, June 21, 2004 11:36 AM To: C  Subject: RE: ya know what,..

She told me that buying the day bed was her contribution to the family so that she didn't feel left out. It wasn't about caring for the kids, She bought them to make herself feel better.    Personally, I feel like an ass for how grateful I was towards her efforts in getting J  and I to Colorado. I honestly felt that maybe this year would be different than last, and that she was showing that the kids were more important than the adult's needs.    How is it that I can see hope in an effort made by everyone, and she turns it into something ugly?   I'm so tired of ugliness and fear.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----Original Message----- From: R  Sent: Monday, June 21, 2004 12:07 PM To: C  Subject: RE: ya know what,..  This goes back to that "surface" person we talked about a while back...the attributes of yours she would take on, and how in theory, the L you know is a meld of her former relationships...etc.    it's a fundamental lack of understanding, not out of malice, I don't think. Just inability to grasp that concept. The gestures are big, the beds, the truck, yadda,...but it doesn't come from a place that would allow her to feel included, even if she spent every day and night with you guys  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------Original Message----- From: C   Sent: Monday, June 21, 2004 12:13 PM To: R Subject: RE: ya know what,..  Well, she sure serves it up with a side order of malice.  I honestly feel like there is nothing I can do to satisfy her. She's being totally unreasonable.  I refuse to be responsible for making her feel comfortable in my life. Maybe she should just own up to the fact that this situation isn't what she wants, and that's why she is so miserable. That being said, maybe I should ponder that thought as well.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Stalemate

      It's Monday morning. *sigh*   Time to hop on the choo-choo train into the land of make believe.  Work is a joke these days.  I feel like I'm stuck in tarpaper.  One big fly stuck to a desk.  Then I come home and I have the kids. That's the only reality I have in my life. But I've been accused of pretending L doesn't exist with them.  (It's all about parenting, and being responsible about how and what I teach my kids. I've already fucked things up enough, I don't want to screw this up as well... so I'm taking it slow and learning along with them. I hate her for refusing to understand that. I'm supposed to be infiniately patient, but she refuses to give even the barest of understanding to what she doesn't like, and I hate ignorance.)  Friends? oh please. I have to pretend they aren't meaningful. Gods Forbid I should have OTHER signifigant people in my life.  My relationships are a constant game of "let's pretend" because the reality of my situation is just too fucking bleak. I really try to ignore the track record, that's why I'm still involved.   But that's how it goes. I get to this point, call it all off and they just wait me out...   However, L even said that SHE should be the one to end things with me. I guess that's just what it would take, since my leaving all those times didn't amount to shit.  It will be permanent the day she says so. Maybe that's what she needs. Maybe she needs to leave. I say need because she obsesses on the thought that everyone she loves leaves her. Maybe she'll feel more balanced if she is the one that walks away from me. Maybe that's why it feels so horrible and wrong for me to leave HER. *shrugs* I'm just speculating. She repeats the vicious cycle of punishing me for her mother's wrongs, and puninshing every man for her step-father's sins... so maybe she's using our relationship for this as well. If she leaves me behind, she'll leave it all behind once and for all. It seems right... because she doesn't truly see our relationship as it is. It's just more make-believe.  I'm a married woman, with three kids. I still love J very much, and always have. But she doesn't see it that way. Whenever I exhibit signs of who I really am, she loses it. "You get so much closer to J when the kids are here"  Oh yes, I very much do draw him closer. Kids bind us together because we chose to raise those kids as a family. Go figure. She's waiting him out.    He's not leaving. In fact, J... well, he's steadily showing signs of improvement. I don't get "I can't" from him.. I hear "I will" and "I am" I am constantly hit with a barrage of hearing about his grades, his tests, his acomplishments... so that I am well aware of his efforts toward a goal. He says it's to show me that the family is important, that he's doing these things for us. He accepts how badly he fucked up, and now I guess we shall see. He even accepts L for the most part... as long as she's not trying to tear us apart with demanding tantrums. As men go, You know, I could have done much worse with a blood-bond. But he's still a mean bastard and I'm still terrified it will end up the same way as before. But that's my hang up, and that's why I don't live with him. He's charming, but he'd lie. Maybe I'm just here as a crutch. Only time will tell.

      Today is Father's day.   So it will be nice to have a reason to be "all about J & the kids".   I can't possibly get in trouble for spending time with them all EXCLUSIVELY on FATHER'S DAY.  But who knows, and really... who cares?  *ponders*

      Have you ever laughed so hard that you ended up pee'in in your britches, just a little?  mmmmmyeah... Well, if you HAVE then you are sitting there enjoying a private chuckle over that which inspired your spontaneous urination. If not, then you OBVIOUSLY have never spent any amount of time with a drunken Virgo female.   (It's ok... I got paybacks)  Wait.. I'm getting ahead of myself.  This weekend Albuquerque held it's Annual Gay Pride Celebration.  (settle in, this could take a while)  Let me start by saying, I adore our quaint little dirt town~ and we hold the absolutely cutest parade. *smiles* I went to the first "official" parade and festival three years ago, with my buddy Holly. (ha! buddy... Holly.. BUDDY HOLLY!!! heeee.. haa. ha? *ahem*) So It's been kind a tradition. Every year, no matter what.. We go to PRIDE together. Last year kind of sucked, for lots of different reasons~ but we still attended the Parade and then met up at the local chickie bar and spent some time feelin proud.   Well, THIS year, H has to outdo herself (because she's all about the goals you know) and actually ENTERS a car into the parade. This boils down to H babysitting two of the most obnoxious and outrageous family members I have ever met. (and THAT'S somethin, let me tell you) A ended up drunk and falling out of the car, while M has mental flashback and almost beats the tar out of A. *sigh*  Poor lil'trooper H is walking along behind the car throughout the parade, picking up after Tweeldle Queen and Tweedle Dyke, and trying desperately to keep the peace. By the time she reaches the fairgrounds for the festival, she's covered in dust and absolutely exasperated.   Let me say right now that Hbis high maintenance on a mild day... So when she walked up to us on Saturday, I had serious concerns about spontaneous combustion.   H is an amazing young person. She's the only Virgo I have left and I adore her because she is very much me, 10 years ago. I'm Yoda to her Obi Wan. She's Garth to my Wayne. We are peas and carrots like Jenny and Forrest could only dream of being. She's *almost* as girly as I am.  Back to the story...   So L and I take her under our wing, after giving each other that silent "oh my" nod that couples come to know. (L has a real knack for being steady handed when it comes to dealing with exasperated women... when she feels so inclined, that is) Luckily H was in L's good graces, and the evening progressed under the watchful eye of my Cancerian girlfriend.    So we are going to fastforward through the time we spent ditching the strange woman that wanted to make H her love bunny, past the awkward encounter with a gentleman I work with (he was wearing extremely revealing hotpants. ew.), past running into everyone's ex's, past the cookout, naptime and the numerous phone calls from Fawncy Awna *why WAS she calling ME anyway??* let's keep moving... being stuck outside of the trendy lesbian bar waiting in line to get in, meeting up with A and M, past the first round of Hot Flash shooters and beers, past getting H to dance on a table *I dare ya!*, (I think there was another set of shots & beer in there somewhere) last dance, last call and lights up.... and move right on into crossing the street.  (not AT ALL where you thought it was going, I know.)  It was quite a sight. L (our designated driver for the evening) was attempting to lead our tipsy little femme caravan across the street to our car. There was oncoming traffic a good MILE down the road and I decided it was time to yell "RUN!!" and took off while I had an extremely firm hold on H's hand. *snicker* Of course, this startled her into a moment of sobriety, and upon arrival she immediately (quite seriously) states that she was so scared she almost peed her pants. Of course, this instilled fits of laughter from everyone within earshot. By the time we finally got to the car we were out of breath and damn near in tears.  That's when it happened. I got into the car, she handed me greenery and she made me laugh and then the coughing, and more laughing, and tears... And then... The dribble.   I got her back though. It was her car I piddled in.  I love pride.  I really do. I wonder what it's going to be like next year.

      OWMIGAWD I am starving!!!!  I swear, this damn diet is going to kill me today.  I've been doing the Atkins thing since the beginning of February, and my scale informed me this morning that in 2 more lbs, I'll have lost a grand total of 20!  Yay me!   But I'm doing it a little differently this week. I've been drinking the shakes for breakfast and having the meal bars for lunch. I've lost 3 lbs in 2 days. Well, that plus I've been tanning... and that makes you sweat like a hog. *a TAN hog* I go back for another "sweathog" session this afternoon... Need to be tan for  urlLink PRIDE , you know.   I keep trying to remind my groaning stomach that all this pain is WORTH it. *laughs* but I don't think it believes me.... I forgot my diet bar *d'oh!* and even though it's a horrible, tasteless mishmash of god-knows-what... I know it won't go directly to my ass. And since I ran out of the house in such a rush, I must suffer.  ... I wonder how many carbs there are in envelope glue...

      *sigh* I'm gonna pout for a min, okee??  .......................................  *sigh*  .......................................  I keep looping back to California~ The evening when we stopped and watched the sun set.... The waves were dotted with surfers, enjoying the last wild ride of the day. We climbed walked down to the beach, and then it happened... it came after me.  I feel that was a true defining moment in my life.  The moon controls the tides~ that's the problem I'm having.  It's like all of nature and the heavens are set against me!!  I should pack up my happy, warm little bonfire and move to safer ground. But I WANT beachfront property dammit!!  I love the strength of the sea~ and all of the mysteries and beautiful depth. The passion of the sea, it calls to my heart. I feel like I belong there.    *sigh*   I just want to find a little piece of beach that won't be drowned whenever the moon and sea feel inclined to destroy my little world!!    The trick is finding safe distance. But the sea doesn't allow distance when it wants you. It just comes right up to your camp and kicks your ass. Pounds you into the sand and then leaves you there, a dry husk of what you once were. Or it carries you away, never to be seen or heard from again.  *stockpiles more driftwood for the long haul*   If Tom Hanks can find an Island. I can too dammit!   ***Note: B has suggested "Stilts" as a solution....

      So over the last two weeks... due to a particularly rash and incredibly stupid breakup, I've had some extra time on my hands in the evening. Rather than applying my energies to one of my many artsy-crafty projects, I've been cruising through the vast literary expanse&nbsp;that is&nbsp;blogdonia. Ok, I've been re-arranging my house during the breaks (my neck starts to crick if I sit here too long). And I did manage to make some particularly tasty guacamole for last night's burrito-fest (it's always better the second day). But for the most part, I've been here at my desk... trying to immerse myself in something other than my own reality.   I have to say, "wow". There are some incredibly bright and witty people out in cyberspace.   I hate them.   I'm kidding. It's not like I'm going to break out the spice rack and curse anyone.   However,&nbsp;they do bring my recent laziness into focus.&nbsp; Which completely sucks because&nbsp;thoroughly I enjoy my delusions.   Sometimes, I even give my false pretenses cutsie little names. Everyone, &nbsp;meet Tippy. Tippy is&nbsp;currently enjoying&nbsp;her position at the helm of my&nbsp;skewed vision of love and commitment.&nbsp;  Hi Tippy!   *crunch* *crunch* The green chile really spiced up in the fridge overnight.

      First a Praying Mantis pays a midnight&nbsp;visit to my home computer room window... Bright green and over 3" long he was a site to see! Swaying and dancing on the glass, the storm outside not even phasing his moment of zen.&nbsp; I admired his ability to stay focused and sure footed, amidst the turmoil of the world.   And then this morning a big, fat Cricket comes to live underneath my desk here in the office. He's singing right now "cheerup... cheerup... cheerup" He's all by himself under there and he still managed to find a silver lining to sing about.   *sigh*&nbsp;

      by Lauren Hill  Nothing can be done against the truth No matter how we remain in denial (yeah) Wasting time Replacing time With each empty excuse But that'll only work a little while Coping with despair Knowin' you're not there Ashamed to just admit I've been a fool So I blame it on the sun Run away from everyone Hoping to escape this ridicule Trapped in misery Wrapped so miserably In this deception that I'm wearin' it like a skin Dying to maintain Oh I keep trying to explain A heart that never loved me to begin Oh I'm such a mess I have no choice but to confess That I've been desperately trying to belong Lying to myself  And everybody else Refusing to admit my right was wrong  How beautiful is fruit still in denial of its roots? My guilty heart behaves so foolishly This treason from within That reasons with my sin Won't be happy til' it sees the death of me Selfishly addicted To a life that I depicted Conflicted cuz it's not reality Oh what's left of me I beg you desperately Cause me to agree to what I know is best for me Please save me from myself  I need you to save me from myself Please save me from myself so I can heal The choices that I make Oh have been nothing but mistakes What a wasted use of space Should I die before I wake? In all of my religion I've fortified this prison Obligated to obey  The demands of bad decision Please save me from myself  I need you to save me from myself Please save me from myself so I can heal

      I can't say that I'm not learning. Granted, the topics I've signed on for never seem to contain what they syllabus claims.  I'm learning a lot about Hate from my Love course. There is a fine line between love and hate. Ah, and oldie but a goody. I never let myself realize how true that statement is. Doesn't that suck? The statement, I mean. I don't regret all those years of allowing myself to believe that wrongs can be fixed. For being pretty logical, I'm naive about people. To realize the truth would be to say I'm logical about myself, but ignorant about the people I love.   I'm also learning a lot about Human Nature from my Job Training. Usually I'm a take-charge kind of gal. So I gravitate towards positions that have a lot of freedom and tons of responsibility. But for some reason, in this office... I've resigned myself to being low man on the totem pole, and really kind of liking it. Then there is the whole "PhD's: How smart people interact with one another" I feel like a placebo. Not really effecting the study, but somehow.. They THINK I do. Results will be posted as soon as I get a clean data pool.   I'm learning a lot about Respect in my Motorcycle Training. If you don't respect the machine, you end up dead.  I'm learning a lot about Adults in my Parenting Class. I can see where my mother was, when I was 13.  I'm learning a lot about Spirituality in my Gardening course. Love helps everything grow.  I'm learning a lot about Relationships in Home Economics. No matter what you put in the washer, if they don't match... Bad things happen.  I'm learning a lot about Communication from my Feline Instructors. Yawn when you are tired, it lets people know what's on your plate at the moment.   Two things to remember about the School of Life: 1. You can't bribe the professors, because you never know who they are. 2. Test Schedule: 24/7/365.

      I became a mom at a pretty young age. When I had my first son, I was the tender age of 20. His father was barely more than an a flirtatious acquaintance when I turned up pregnant. *oopsie!* Being my mother's daughter, I decided that I should give parenthood a whirl. Being completely broke, I decided I should get my ass on welfare.   It was tough. I'm not particularly maternal by nature. My first son bonded with my mother because I didn't know how to handle the tremendous importance of the first few months of a baby's life. Honestly... I would have died if my mom weren't there to help me. But I'd be lying if I didn't say now that I was really jealous of the bond they had formed. I felt like an outsider and it killed me for years.    As for my boyfriend, due to pressure from his parents... We decided to give it a go, and in the process managed to create another son. So, I found myself with two boys... Eighteen months apart, and a live-in boyfriend.  Happily, I learned my lesson with my oldest, and cherished my new baby as much as possible. I loved him so much. My heart burst with joy every time I held him, and it also tinged with pain for the loss of that feeling with my oldest. I tried as hard as I could to make up for missing out, by investing as many kisses and hugs I could manage.   My oldest still stayed distant... We love each other, but things remained very confrontational. My mom favored him, and it made things even more tense... But I couldn't blame her. She got a second chance at being a mommy... And she doted on his needs. Now, I'm grateful that he had his grandma to take good care of him. I was young, selfish and terrified, and she taught us all how to make it day by day.   So the years have passed, relationships came and went.... And the dynamic between me and my kids hasn't changed much... I know I've become more comfortable as a mother, and I think that really helps me to understand my faults, and accept the consequences for the bad choices I made along the way. I'm only human, and I did the best that I could at the time.   Thirteen years have passed since I was that terrified and miserable little girl.. Holding a baby and not knowing what to do next. Now I look at my son and I am incredibly proud. He's smart... Wickedly smart. He's also really funny. I can't express how even the smallest kind gestures relate how much he loves me. We sat on the couch and he told me jokes. Just sitting there, listening to him laugh was so awesome.  He's going to be a handsome man. I see a lot of his father there, but finally I see a reflection of myself. This year he's decided that he likes me, and for the first time of my adult life I feel forgiven.  My youngest is now Eleven, and I still marvel at how he is so very in touch with the feelings of people in his life. A true sensitive soul. He's hit worst by the fate of his parents. He doesn't remember a time where he ever had his mom and dad there, together. I've always been his confidant, ever since he could first speak. My oldest calls him a tattle-tale, but I know that it's about trust. He trusts me with his feelings... Always has. Little boy blue, that one. He's not had his secret-keeper for a couple of years, and he's showing the strain.  Their dad turned out to be a pretty ok guy after a few years. He grew up, got his heart broken a few times and now realizes just how important life with the boys truly is. They have lived with him for two school years now... I don't blame them, he's a pretty likeable guy. *smiles* We are friends now, because things are hard enough on the kids without feeling like they are in the middle of a war. We decided that long ago and have been pretty diligent with following that pledge. I'd say our biggest challenge as parents is the religion extreme. I'm pagan, he's RLDS. *Reorganized Church of Latter Day Saints* Couldn't be farther apart on the spectrum. So the boys live a pretty restrained life with their dad... And when they come live with me, they sort of blossom into who they really want to be.   K is writing stories about Harry Potter. (Expressly forbidden by Dad!) C is releasing pent up emotions. (also Expressly forbidden by Dad!) They also have their own rooms... Personal space is helping them dig the atmosphere. Well, space and cake for breakfast.   I'm happier than I've been for years. I love having them home with me, and I don't know how I'm going to let them go back. I know I have to let go of my oldest, he's promised another year to his father. But my youngest wants to stay. I'm hoping next year I will have both of them back.  I'm being called away to teach them how to play cribbage, I've more on the subject but will do it justice by writing at the opportune time.

      *sigh*  I had a teensy-weensy nervous breakdown on Friday.  Nothing extraordinary.  Just the usual crying, screaming and praying for death. *nods*  Not suicidal (gods no!) I just wanted to go poof.  You know, be instantly zapped to an alternate form of energy placement.   ...Kind of like praying for Scotty to beam you out of trouble.   I'm one of those people that really keeps an ultra death-grip hold on their emotions.  I use them to propel me through life. It's very efficient and clean burning fuel. I'm quite convinced that since I've learned to harness this power I've become near invincible. Just ask my cats. They will tell you ALL about the Lean, mean logical machine.  Alas, even the most sophisticated power house needs to release pressure in some way or it will implode and create a vacuum. (Nature abhors a vacuum) My daily release comes in the form of artistic expression... usually in written word. I also sing. Great fun. Keeps the chakras free running and low maintenance.  The big bad-ass multi-user build up is what gets me every now and again.   Can you imagine what my aura looks like?  (What with being subjected to an almost constant influx of emotional toxic waste!)   Let's see...how shall I describe it... well, It's very much like walking through wet strips of cling-wrap.  It doesn't stick to me, it sticks to itself.   Eventually, I end up frantically wading through a pool of clingy goo.  A pit of yuck that isn't even MINE. (See above, usage: "energy to propel")  Oh-no...This glop is made up of used cling wrap.  You know, from the random people who have joined the picnic.  These are people that bring really disgusting food to the table.  Like Marshmallow & Pimento salad. [insert involuntary shudder]  Are you picturing this clearly? It's about the color of lemon pudding... with lumps.   Basically... all I did on Friday...  was displace an emotional Lugie.   Now everything will run a little more lean here in la-la land...   ...Maybe I should look into replacement parts BEFORE everything falls apart again

      I feel like I exist beyond the scope of this reality.  I'm stuck here. Brought against my wishes. Bound by blood.  What is this devotion? Why am I so determined to uphold my oath, when it's always been one sided? I was so blinded by need that I believed in this. Now, I'm enveloped by the sticky oppression of reality.  When I was a little girl, I started having a recurring dream.  I would drift off to sleep and feel myself floating in a black sea of nothing Suspended by an unseen force, I could feel it's energy all around me The quiet humming... I knew it was there with me louder and louder until the inky film around me would buzz like a swarm of angry wasps I was tossed in the swells, held firm by the grasp of an unknown spirit My heart pounding in my chest, thrumming and struggling, deafening Pressure building all around Every inch of my body was being strangled Down into my throat, capturing my screams Invading my mind No escape Only fear
