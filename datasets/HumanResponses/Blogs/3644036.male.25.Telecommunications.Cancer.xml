      Things are getting underway now. I bought a van for my job and have moved just about everything I own out to my new place in Lloydminster. I worked there from June 21 - 25 and it seems like a decent place, even though there's a major abundance of hicks living there. For anyone who doesn't know, Lloydminster is a city of about 18,000 people that is divided into halves -- one half being in Alberta (the bigger booming half) and the other being in Saskatchewan (the smaller, slower growing half). The settlement actually existed before 1905 when AB and SK were formed. They were separated by coincidence (I've done my reading). The border runs down 50 Avenue, and in the older part of town the border is actually painted onto the sidewalk. I guess if you were an 18-year old drinking a beer and walking north down that sidewalk, you'd have to make sure the beer is in your left hand and not your right; otherwise you'd get busted for underage drinking (if you didn't get busted for drinking in public first). Other differences other than the drinking age: alcohol, the phone company and registries are still all gov't owned and operated on the SK side of town. And for the people who keep asking, no there is no PST in Lloydminster. It would obviously be unfair if there was.  That's about all I have for now, tomorrow is the big day where I actually relocate 'myself' out of E-town. :)  Later.

      I've been thinking about setting a blog up for quite some time now, but I never got around to it. So today I forced myself to! I'm going to be moving to Lloydminster, Alberta in the next couple of weeks to work at my new job with Shaw. It's probably the best time to start a blog -- then I can tell you about all my crazy adventures. And if I buy a digital camera like I'm planning to, you can even see this crazy town and all its crazy inhabitants!   I'm currently VERY busy trying to get all my moving stuff done. My apartment is a complete disaster right now, for two main reasons:  1) I'm pulling stuff out and getting it ready to move. 2) I've been a lazy ass all week and I haven't cleaned anything up!  That's my pathetic little introduction. If you'd like to keep up to date with my life, keep coming back and keep in touch!

      A month ago I didn't think I'd be trying to move again. I had a talk with the landlord across the street yesterday where the 'nice' apartments are. I told her I wanted to apply for a suite (vacancy is 0% here) and because she's seen me around a few times, I think I got hookups. At least that's the way it sounded. I dropped off the application and now I'm just waiting for a call. Why do I want to move? This place is really run down. It has tons of room, a fireplace and air conditioner but the rest of it honestly looks like shit. They didn't paint the walls before I moved in and the ceiling needs some serious repairs. And I've talked to the landlord TWICE now about the water leaking through the ceiling in&nbsp;my bathroom; I think it's the hot water from upstairs. It obviously was leaking in the past because there's a panel on the roof over the tub where it comes through. I don't have to put up with this and I'm not going to.  Another big reason I want to move: I heard on the radio this morning that a man was arrested at my apartment complex on Monday night. He was running around and peeking through people's windows. But that's not the&nbsp;creepy part --&nbsp;THE GUY WAS NAKED. Yes you read that&nbsp;correctly. And guess what. I live on the bottom floor. So umm yeah I'm moving and I'm taking the baseball bat under my bed with me.   In other news, I bought myself a cool new digital camera like I wanted to. It's a HP Photosmart R707 with 5.1MP and this thing kicks some major ass. It has 32MB of internal memory plus the 256MB I added to it. Not only can it take and hold a ton of pictures, it can take very good quality videos with sound. Nice eh? In the near future I'll start putting pictures and short video clips up for all of you to see. Something to ponder until then...my temporary tattoo at Klondike Days. The artist actually begged me to let her do it, and for free. Later.

      Yes that's right, today is my birthday and what did I do? I worked. Oh what fun. Actually&nbsp;I worked but I was done early. Normally I pick up some extra work to make extra&nbsp;money but today is my day so I'm taking it easy. It's been a rough week anyways, lots of work to do and I've put in some long hours, which will be worth it when I get by paycheque. I'm just a little tired.  I had a really bad day a couple of days ago. I was bringing a line up to a room so I could install internet for a customer and instead of drilling into the wall and down to the basement, my stupid flexible drill bit (I blame the drill bit!) decided to go in the wall and&nbsp;through the outside wall - right through the stucco. OOPS! I'm going to have a pay for that. Shit happens I guess but I didn't want it happening this soon! &nbsp; You know that trailer&nbsp;trash stereotype you see on tv and in the movies? I always thought it was nothing but an overexaggeration...UNTIL TODAY. I saw long-necked grandpa revving up his truck in front of the trailer while laughing like a chipmunk, grandma with a brushcut and no teeth and their daughter (I think) with her greasy long 'man style' mullet and dirty clothes that were way too small for her. They even had the&nbsp;typical&nbsp;'trailer trash accent.' I couldn't understand a thing they were saying. It was so weird. &nbsp; Thanks to everyone who phoned me and wished me a happy birthday.

      Wow I come home for my long weekend (I get a long weekend every 2 weeks) and there's mass chaos with the weather yet again. I was hoping to escape all the rain we've been having in Lloydminster for a couple of days but it looks like Mother Nature is mad at me for some reason. I'm not sure what I did but I'm really sorry!   Everything is moving along smoothly so far with my new job. My pay has increased quite considerably, jumping way up from my measly training wage (which was more than I've ever made before) to where it is now. I'm really happy about that, now I can start figuring out what I want to do with my life.  urlLink These  have crossed my mind lately, I think they look really cool. Throwing a nice system and a few extras like a sunroof and tinted windows would turn that into one sweet looking car (no tint on the front windows, I've already had my $115 ticket). Just something for me to think about.  My birthday is coming up very soon, in 5 days to be exact. This is one of those milestone birthdays that you wish would never come -- the BIG 25! Right now I'm looking back at 20 and thinking "Hey, that wasn't that long ago. And that's how long I have until I hit 30." It's also making me look at where I am in my life and where I want to go. I've got some work to do but I'll get there. Thanks to anyone who stopped by the Druid on Friday for the brief amount of time I was there.  [Dad's voice as I'm typing: "We got any Bean-o?"] Yeah I think that was a sign that it's time for me to go out for a little while. Later.

      I'm moving across the street at the end of the month (well, I can start moving my stuff in on the 20th of August). I had a look at the apartment a couple of weeks ago and I'm really impressed. I put a deposit down right away. The carpet and lino are somewhat new and it has a really cool section in the dining room with a bay window where my computer desk will fit nicely. It's a lot nicer than the place I'm in now. My landlord was really disappointed to see me go. She offered to move me to another suite but I had to decline. I like the other apartments better! My new landlord said that she called her up and whined about how she stole one of her best tenants. I found that kind of funny. I will be getting my full damage deposit back - for anyone that doesn't know, the roof in my bathroom leaks water and that's one of the reasons I'm moving.  Work is good, the money is great and the job can be fun but I do literally have to work my ass off. But I can handle it and it WILL be worth it. I have some plans currently circulating through my head that I hope to see through. :)  One thing you do realize when you move away for a while, you realize who your true friends are. Thanks to the people who have taken the time to phone me to say hi and see how things are going. I honestly really appreciate it. It makes me feel like I'm still at home (well I'm not THAT far away but still). And thanks to the people who took the time to stop by and visit. I have lots of pictures, some being of this unidentified drunk (DRUNK?!) person. Hahaha!
