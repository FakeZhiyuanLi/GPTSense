      haha, well today was FUN!!! Ok, I'm working on about 7 hours of sleep total these past 2 days, so just bare with me. I woke up this morning at 6:30 am!!! yeah buddy...I got to volunteer for McKinney's Make a Difference Day, we made crafts for the meals on wheels program, I sware if I have to color any more bunnies or make any more turkeys...lol. So I worked from about 8am-12 pm, yay I got 4 hours for National Honor Society :). After that me and Kiera went to Starbucks of course because I was like dead, mmmm caffine...Then we went to Plano and went to Collin Creek Mall and met up with my fave whores Embry and Emily!!! We tried on Winter Ball dresses. So many cute ones...too bad the person I wanna go with can't probably go with me, let alone see me in my dress :(. I don't know if I want a black and white one or a red one. I might wait until Prom for the red one. Since Collin Creek didn't have alot of good dress stores, we drove to Frisco to go to Stonebriar Mall. There I found my dress. Omg, it is so pretty, black in the middle with white sides. I looked so great in it, my figure looked so good, ahh I love my curves ^_^! David I wish you could of seen me in it... Too bad the dress was $337, though money's not really an issue, but that's what you'd probably want to spend on prom, not the winter ball. There was a red one with the sides cut out that I liked, I'll probably get that one. All I bought today was 2 thongs, lol. One had cherries on it, come on y'all know I love cherries! And I got this really cute black and pink one that laced and tied at the hips, it is sooooo CUTE, haha there's only one person that's ever going to see me in it ;), those are my "special thongs". Too bad I ran out of money, because I saw these lacy boy shorts that were black with a cursive pink "D" on them, Embry was like omg you need to get these to wear for David, lol. Might have to go back and get those...;)  I haven't been home since about 7 am and it's now like almost 11 pm, lol. If I wasn't so dead tired I would stay up and watch SNL, but I'm about to fall over and why is it so FREAKING COLD HERE!!! BRRRR!!! Stupid Texas...   All of your friends think I'm just too young for you So tell them, that I can do things girls their age can do Let me love you down, even If It takes all night

      omg I'm so scared right now. Though, I have calmed down since 3rd period, lol, I'm not shaking anymore. Right after I sent the email, I literally thought I was going to throw up, so I just left class and went to Kiera's class and got her out of there, she saw me and was like why are you shaking so much, so I just sat in the middle of the hallway and told her what I did. I was gone for about 15 minutes, I didn't care what the sub thought why I was gone for so long, like it was any of his business. Omg, did I do the right thing?   So I should keep this to myself And never let you know

      I guess for the first time I really have nothing to say. I guess it's because the last couple of days I've really haven't felt anything. I've been trying to get my mind off everything, so I've been doing as much as possible to do that. I finally saw LOTR: The Two Towers. It was awesome, Orlando Bloom and Elijah Wood are so freaking hot, I love their eyes and omg Elijah's hair, ahhhh so sexy. It reminds me alot of David's hair, god his hair is so freakin hot, he better know that when I see him I'm going to mess with his hair, so sweetie you better not have a phobia about that. Ok, don't think I'm a freak or anything but in a weird, sick twisted way, Gollm from LOTR is kinda cute, lol, I know I'm probably on something, like he's so repulsive looking its cute...I don't know. I'm going to shut up now...  What do you do when you need to tell someone something but you're afraid of their reaction? I guess if they love you enough they'll understand and forgive you for the things that you do to yourself...and I'm making a promise that'll I'll never do it again, no matter how upset I am, all my friends know, there is just one person out there who I care really deeply for, that I don't want to know, but he'd probably find out sooner or later, you can only hide things for so long...Just understand that some things are way too stressful and people deal with certain things different ways. That was just my way of letting things out, and I promise everyone that I'm never going to do it again, I swear to y'all. So David I hope when I tell you, you won't be upset with me or wanna break up, I'm so sorry I haven't told you sooner...I hope you can forgive me...   It's undeniable that we should be together It's unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never The basis is need to know, if you don't know just how I feel Then let me show you now that I'm for real

      Well what can we say about yesterday! Hahhahaha it was OSOME!!! Here's a tip when painting someone's room...make sure that the windows are open and DON'T SHUT THE DOOR! lol, me and Em did that, and omg, we were so freaking messed up. We didn't realize anything until we all just started randomly laughing. I was like Kiera, when you paint you need to open windows...plus it didn't help that we just began sniffing the paint cans, lol, then we went and jumped on the trampoline haha, that's so safe, especially when you are like particially high...look at my flip!!! BAM!! You're supposed to stay on the trampoline, lol. Then a few more sniffs later, me and Kiera went to starbucks and hung out. All in all, the day was pretty eventful. I found out something that Kiera did last weekend. I know she did it for me, but I'm still embarrassed about it. Though it really shows how much she cares about me, so Kiera, I LOVE YOU!! Though I really wished David would of told me that Kiera imed him. I didn't find out until yesterday when I was at her house and we opened her log manager and I found the convo and read it. You know I'm really glad when it takes my best friend yelling at my boyfriend to actually get him to IM me. It made me realize that when he imed me last saturday, when I was so upset, that Kiera made him do it, he didn't do it himself...and I saw something he said to Kiera that I seriously thought we were passed. It was about the whole caring part in our relationship, and yea he's told me this before, but I thought we talked it out and everything was ok...But I'm not going to dwell on what happened last week, what's the point? It doesn't change anything...things were said and done and nothing can be taken back, so whatever.   I tried to kill the pain, but only brought more I lay dying and I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal I'm dying praying bleeding and screaming Am I too lost to be saved?

      Can't sleep. How is it when you are so tired, but yet you can't fall to sleep? I know I need to sleep, I've had like 8 hrs total in the past 3 days, and I just realize I have dark circles under my eyes. ahhhh....I seriously have way too much on my mind. My aunt, my grades, and David. Which thinking about him really helps me, I just wish I could talk to him :(. So I guess I just need to stop stressing, deal with it, and go to sleep. I hate it when I get in these moods. Like right now, I seriously have an erge to do something, that I have promised I'd never do again, but I can't help it. It's nawing at me, it's what I do to relieve stress and other emotional crap. And no it has nothing to do with drugs/alcohol/sex, it's more...ahhh I can't explain it. Only Rhonda knows what I'm talking about, she can relate. Sometimes I feel like getting into bed and just never waking up, but then I'd miss out on life and in life to get to the happy stuff you must get through all the bad...so I'm not just going to give up. All I want is David, but he's not here...I know that if I was in his arms, nothing could hurt me, his strength and love would be enough...:::sigh:::   hold on to me love you know I can't stay long all I wanted to say was i love you and I'm not afraid

      wow, what to say about today. Well first off I had my ROR English test, 19 freaking short answer essay questions, I had to miss the first 45 minutes of my 2nd period class just to finish it. It took me abour 2 hours, 4 pages front and back, ahhh it was easy, but tedious. And now I have a 82 in english which I'm not happy about, nor am I happy about the 75 I made on my chem district assessment and the 61 on my Algebra 2 one, so yeah now I have 3 Bs and 5 As, ahhhh hopefully they'll go up some before the cut off tomorrow. I know I'm really hard on myself about grades, I seriously have to have like a 96 or above in each class. Oh well...The German test was pretty easy, though we all talked during it. And then I didn't know a word and I was like what the hell Mr. Smith, lol, that got some laughs. Will goes, "the language in this class has hit an all time low" or something like that, hey we all get away with it, so yeah I could care less. Rehearsal was boring as usual, Ms. Welch was on a rampage, so I couldn't listen to my cd player. The good thing is that for the first time in about 8 weeks I have no homework. I'm upset though, I just found out that my aunt, the one that I'm closest to has cancer, I hope she can get through it, all my family on my dad's side dies from cancer, so I'm scared for her, I don't want anything to happen to her :(. Well, I've got a headache and not really in a good mood, so I'm just going to go to bed. night   If there's nothing missing in my life, then why do these tears come at night?

      Well, Preston was wrong and we don't have rehearsals today so woo! ok, we didn't have our memorization test in theatre, which is fine by me, since I already had 3 tests today, but knowing Ms. Welch, it'll probably be on Friday, who knows?! Algebra district assessment I think went well, I'll find out friday. Ummm History, well I got 29 out of the 60 multiple choice questions right, so I made a 35% out of like 70% on the MC part of the test, hey I didn't get the lowest and hopefully I did good on the essays, plus he's going to curve it, so yeah I hope I passed. I just wish I did better on the MC, ahhhh oh well that test was fark hard, lol. Chemistry was ok, I'll know on Friday, I think I did well. So all I have tomorrow is English I have about 50 pgs left to read in 1984, then I need to study for my German test. But at least this day is over and hopefully with these freaking assesments I didn't totally screw up my GPA :(. Well I'm really tired, so I'm going to take a nap.   Well I want to take you as I find you  Imagine our clothes are on the floor  Feel my caress so soft and gentle  So delicate you cry for more  You know baby does it right

      Well, I just got home from rehearsals, wahooness! Ah, I thought I didn't have to go to rehearsal tomorrow, but apparently I do, so the only day I have off is Friday, yee! Starbucks here I come! mmmmm caramel ;) Anyways, I so do not want to go to class tomorrow. I HAVE FOUR FREAKING TESTS ALL IN A ROW!!! AHHH :::slashes wristes::: haha jk! Theater should be pretty easy, Algebra I guess should be ok, AP US History and Chemistry are the ones I'm really worried about, oh well, I'll be so happy when tomorrow is over. Even though I have 2 more tests on Thursday, English and German, I sware to God too many tests! I know this is the last week of our 9 weeks, but it's all crammed in to like 2 days! But enough of my ranting, on to the good things. Last night I was on the phone with my David for like 2 hours, it was the greatest thing, I just hope he knows how much I care about him and that I don't know what I'd do without him. Which reminds me, I had the BEST DREAM last night. And yes it is about David, and if you don't want to hear about him, then don't read my blog, hehe :P. Ok, this is the dream, me and him were just sitting around with a bunch of people and I was in his lap with my arms around him. Well we cuddled for awhile, then we got up and went into my room, got into my bed...and....then the freaking alarm clock goes off. DAMMIT!! lol. Oh well, I'll finish the dream, hopefully. So yeah I'm in a really good mood today, I feel like I am on top of the world. Talking to him last night and then that dream, awwww just makes me melt...German today was so awesome. I did nothing, which is not like me, but I was just too happy to work. So I got on the floor and did some gymastics stuff. Like the bridge, where you put your whole body in the air with you arms and legs, I love doing that. Then I got on one of the back tables and just laid down. Mr. Smith didn't say anything, so oh well. I mean you have Embry and Will trying to rape each other, me always doing some weird stuff, Ryan trying to kill Will and yeah that's my German class. 0_o! Well, I have gone on long enough. Peace out peeps!   I need you like water like breath, like rain I need you like mercy from Heaven's gate There's a freedom in your arms that carries me through I need you

      This is cool, an online journal. Truthfully I think this totally defeats the purpose of a journal, since most journals are private, but oh well. I want everyone to know my deep dark secrets and feelings, muwhahhaa! I guess I can start off by saying, I love you David! After a horrible week, talking to him really cheered me up, I don't know what I'd do without him. I really need to be doing my history homework, but I'm being lazy, so yeah, it'll get done before midnight, maybe. Ah, for the next 5-6 weeks I have after school rehearsals for A Midsummer Night's Dream until 6. I'm really glad I'm a fairy and all, but staying after school does get boring, even though, I'm sure me, Dylan, and Rhonda will get into some sort of trouble together, haha. Well I've gone on long enough, not a whole lot of stuff to say.   I'm here without you baby, but you're still on my lonely mind, I think about you baby and dream about you all the time...

      For some odd reason, tonight I just started writing poems...why? Seriously, I've got no clue. But, I'll post them, they're ok, one's really depressive and sad, the other is happy is a sense. And they're both personal, so yeah.  "scars" I cut to take away the pain The ebbing emotional pain that would never cease Now, instead of pain, I have the scars Each day, I look at them, Remembering the nights I would play with my razor blade... To feel the release the crimson blood brought And now as I sit on my bed, I can remember each scar and what they represent I live the pain over again My scars, Will they ever go away?  "waiting" Anticipation is building I wish it was that day already, The day I can be with you Until then I wait Hoping as each day passes, It brings me closer to you Somedays are harder than others But, I know in my heart,  That day will come, Where I can hold you in my arms, look in your eyes, And say, I love you  I guess, for some reason I'm depressed tonight, which is weird considering I don't think anything is wrong...the only reason I say this is because that urge to cut came back, thus why I wrote "scars", BUT WHY :(... like I don't have enough cuts on my wrists as it is...   My soul cries for deliverance

      THE PLAY IS OFFICIALLY OVER!!!!!! THANK GOD!! Yea, I've decided not to try out for the musical. Why? Because it's RIGHT AFTER the Fall Play, I seriously need a break, plus only the top theatre, choir and dance people will make it, so I probably wouldn't even get a part, like last year. I love being pessimistic! Anyways, cast party at Hooter's tonight, fun fun, first time I've been to that place, pretty cool.   Now, instead of reading the last 40 pgs in Huck Finn, I'm just going to look at the spark notes online! woo! thanks Ritika :0) Oh finally did I mention how much I love David?! I love David!!! Oh man I hope we can work everything out for Christmas, even though I do have to go to Tennessee, unless I can get out of it, if not, I'll just fake the flu! lol...I'm bad, but I can't help it, I don't wanna wait till Spring Break :(.

      Home from rehearsals...finally! Tonight was the dress rehearsal, I didn't think it went too bad, I'm sure everything will be fine for Friday, and if not, Ms. Welch will kill us all. OMG, I have so many freaking tests this week and next. ok, why did the teachers assign all this during late night rehearsals week? Are they that freaking EVIL? Yes, they are. Literary Terms test in English on Thursday, as well as a quiz in SAT Prep over verbal words, prefixes, and suffixes, plus a German test, yay! Then on Friday, I have an Algebra 2 test and the Unit 3 test for US History, which I know I'm going to fail, so no use studying. Then next week, I have 2 tests in English, one over Huck Finn (which I'm half through) and out Required Outside Reading (ROR) which I haven't even started! haha...Then a Chemistry test, and that could be it...well at least I won't have probably any homework over the break. :::yawn::: I need to go to bed, but I have uber amounts of homework, I need to finish reading Chapter 17 for History, and then do those German worksheets that will "supposedly help me on the test" and I still have like 5 chapters left to read in Huck Finn by Thursday. And I seriously need to start the Joy Luck Club (my ROR)...I'll give it like till 1, that's how long I was up last night =p!  :::backstage with the "mini fairies" (kids)::: me: "Jimmy this is why we can never get drunk together" :::points at little kids::: jimmy: "We'd just be producing like bunnies...pop pop...." Seriously, me and Jimmy can never get drunk together, lol. ANYWAYS I LOVE MY DAVID TOO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-*   "Hey, wait a minute, don't go 'Cause I'm still in love with you"

      Bored to the max. You know that feeling whenever you really don't want to do anything...oh yeah...laziness...lol. You know a blog/journal/diary is a thing to let out all your inner feelings right? But see this is an online journal, which means all my friends read it and others as well... so do I wanna let out all these emotions? I want to, I especially want the person who means the most to me in my life read it and be like wow, so the question now is, how to say it. I could express it, but he's not here, and I know what I feel, I just don't exactly know how to say it. But here goes. I imagine the first day/night. The tingly feeling in the bottom of my stomach, the nervousness/shyness. The sensation of "is this really happening? or is this another one of my dreams?" Then I look deep in his eyes and realize this is the moment I've been waiting for all my life...He then puts his hands on my sides as we edge closer together...the excitement, the anticipation, finally the moment is here...He leans in for a kiss, I can feel his warmth, the velvety texture of his lips as we embrace. Time feels like it stands still...everything's perfect...I  can see fireworks and now I know the true feeling of love. Everytime I think of David or see his picture, that's what comes to mind. Waiting for him is all worth it, nothing can ever change my feelings for him, they run so deep, to hard to explain, all I know is that he's the only one that can make me truly happy. When we're together "talking" is when I'm the happiest, I don't know if he notices. I'm so lucky to have him in my life. David, I love you, forever and always!   "I know it's nights like these, like the nights that we meet Put my hands on her hips and we swing to the beat Nights like these, when the stars disappear And I give her my word that I will always be there"

      wow, what can we say about this weekend! It was OSOME!! I think this has been the happiest I have felt in along time. I owe it all to my sweetie, David! Talking to him these past few days has felt really good. I don't know how to explain it, but all I know is that love feels really good...   I need you tonight I need you right now I know deep within my heart, it doesn't matter if it's wrong or right

      Ah the day after Christmas...Sad, you anticipated this one day all year and now it's gone...oh well! lol I just want Tuesday to come...Even though I'm nervous, there's a few fears I have. One, is getting caught naturally, but I am good at BSing and I do have alot of my friends to cover for me, so hopefully that won't be a problem.  Two, I just have that fear of you know him seeing me and not being good enough, like maybe I don't look good enough for him, we all know I get self conscious, lol Kiera and Ritika so hate me for that. I can't help it, I guess we all have this perfect image of ourselves :::sigh::: But then I think again, he's probably feeling the same way, then I think no matter what he looks like or whatever I love him and that's all that matters, so then I shouldn' t worry. But yeah, those are a couple of my fears, nothing too big I can't handle, everything is going to be fine. We're going to meet, and then be together for 3 whole days...all I want to do is cuddle, hold hands, kiss, lay on him. I really can't wait for New Years, we can kiss at midnight on New Years Eve, how romantic is that? :D Ahhh, I just wish it was that day already, I hate waiting...   I knew I loved you before I met you I think I dreamed you into life

      I still have yet to study for chem, lol I don't care it should be easy. Well I'm in a better mood than I was earlier. It's good to know now for sure, or at least pretty sure. I just can't wait! Only like 2 more weeks! Hehe, I got David's present...I hope he likes it, it took long enough to come up with, I thank Embry for the help! It's so cute! ;) Only 2 more days of school, then break. I'm sorta excited for xmas, but more so for after xmas, because that's all I wanted anyways, nothing can ever compare to seeing and being with my David. LOTR starts at midnight! I wanna see it! Gollum so rocks my socks, and the Ents, but I heard the ents weren't going to be in it, how sad is that? :( I love the Ents, they're my favorite, besides Gollum that is. Yea, I'm weird, I take huge talking trees and a schizo creature over Orlando Bloom and Elijah Wood, what is wrong with me?! Not that they're hot, because they are, but I'd take Johnny Depp over them anyday...ahhhh he's so f-ing hot! Pirates of the Caribbean baby!   Was it something I didn't say When I didn't say I love you Was it words that you never heard All those words I should have told you All those times, all these nights when I had the chance to...

I don't know what to do...:::cries::: I need to go study for chem though, I don't wanna!

Well, I took my first final today, alg 2, got a 85! wut wut. Tomorrow I have no finals, wednesday I know I have chem but I don't know about history, because some teachers are gay and haven't finished grading our shit. Oh and I have to take German now, because of that one absence, see if I didn't have it, then I would just need an 80 to be exempt instead of an 85, and I have an 83...MOTHERFUCKER!!!! I don't wanna take german, :::Cries:::. As long as I don't have to take history, I good. Anyways, I don't care, I'm just updating this for Ritika. So enjoy it.

See I got a cold, and I let it go into my asthma, which caused acute bronchitis. After performing on Friday night, I went home to bed and I woke up unable to breathe and my meds didn't work. So I got to go to the emergency room at 3 am! Oh fun, but I had to miss 4 hrs of my volunteer work, plus I missed the winter ball :(. Oh well I guess I'll save my dress for prom...Anyways I heard it was uber crowded and you could hardly breathe and alot of people left early, so I didn't miss much. But now everyone is caught up to speed. Oh and one last thing, I GET MY SWEETIE FOR CHRISTMAS!!!!!!!! :) :) :)   It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do To turn around and walk away Pretending I don't love you

      It really bothers me when people try to relate and understand how you feel, when in fact they have NO CLUE. They can say so much, but in reality everyone has different situations. I sometimes feel as though there is no one out there to talk to, to tell them how I really feel, what's the point? They're not going to understand. And everyday it gets worse, I just want them to go away, I hate feeling this way, it's not me. Yeah, I can hide if from people, still be the same hyper, freaking bouncing off the walls me, with all my dumb jokes. But deep down I don't feel that way, I feel alone, empty, quiet, yes I must say that I do get depressed, and there's nothing I can do about it. I hate feeling like there is nothing there, or that time is going way too slow, I know it's just for now, these feelings will fade, but I guess sometimes I get scared that things might not work out the same way as planned. I'm afraid to lose something really great because I can't be there...   Everyone is just the same

      After getting in a fight with John Rae, Arlo and John Rajala in English and almost in a fight with Ryan in German, it has came to my attention that I need Anger Mangement. Fuck yeah I do, I'm not going sit there in fucking english and get ridiculed just because I met someone over the internet. It's seriously none of their fucking business and I really like their opinion since they've probably been through something similar, yeah fucking right, give me a break, they don't know shit. Good thing Em and Danielle are in my class or else John would of gotten hit with the 5 lb. american lit book, I was so angry I was shaking and see I don't get mad very easily or very often for that matter, so when I do it's BAD. And so I've been pretty much pissed off all day, and I nearly got to beat up Ryan in german! yay he said I could break his nose, I was like wtf, no that's too mean, so I decided to hit the wall instead. OMG I HATE JOHN SO FUCKING MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! At least Ms. Williams is cool with it, she helped me calm down a lil bit...   Ready for action, nip it in the butt. We never relaxin’, OutKast is everlastin’

      oh yay oh yay!! Ok, this whole spring break thing with my parents has seriously been like pulling teeth. But finally tonight, I made some progress. See, my mom really doesn't want to take us, she wants us to go in the summer, which we can too =P. But, since she won't go, my dad mentioned my sister taking us, which would be so much better. So I called Candace, and omg she's so for it! She's already planning on when we can leave, if we're flying or driving, car rental, hotel, all that. Which shes good at looking for plane tickets, so if she can't find any cheaper than $249, we'll just drive the 10 hrs. So if we fly, she's planning on us leaving in the evening on March 4th and coming back late Monday night on the 8th. If we drive, we'd leave early March 5th and probably come back on Tuesday the 9th. So just gotta wait and see on that. Now, all that we really need to do is talk it out with my parents, which since Candace is willing to take us, and it was they're idea for her in the first place, all things should be go. I was like is it a good possibly we can go, and Candace was like yea, it is. So yay!!!! But, me and Kiera have to watch Kayla and Christain anytime for Candace, with no pay, that was my bargin to get her to go and it worked! Hey, I'll watch them, I don't care what I'd have to do see David, as long as I get to go, wahooness!!!!!!   In your eyes I see the missing pieces I'm searching for I think I found my way home

      wow, today didn't suck! In theatre, we watched "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, then we got to go to the computer lab during Algebra 2, and history we colored of course, lol and in chem we made ice cream!!! Yeah, the passing period before chem, I met up with Kiera, and I was like I don't want to be here, so I was bitching about that, she was like yeah I know where you want to be...Oh man, making ice cream really hurts your hands, I was flipping that bag with ice and rock salt until my hands were freaking burning and red, they seriously didn't get warm until like 4. But it was good. Oh man, I have a german test tomorrow, and I need to go in for Algebra again, because I have to finish my test from last week and now the practice taks. Which really sucks because that is our graduation test and you have to get 35/60 to pass, and well I got 23/60, but I still have like 9-10 problems left, which still wouldn't help, because I'd have to get all those right and it still wouldn't even add up, oh well, hopefully I'll do better on the real one.  At this point, nothing anymore really matters...I just want to be 18...    Do you ever wake up reaching out for me? Do I ever cross your mind anytime? I miss you

      wow, what a weekend! Last night, Chris, Em's ex had a wreck near my house. See, Em wanted to go get some ice cream because we were going to have a movie and night, so we drive to the store and Chris meets us there. Well, we hang for a bit, get the ice cream then leave. Chris thinks it's a cool idea to follow Em out to my house and while he's driving he's going into the other lane you know the one with head on traffic, and really it was a bad night to be driving period, foggy, rainy, slick, you know. Well I was playing around and I locked Chris out of my gate, because I was already in enough trouble with my parents about leaving, I didn't need a guy following us home.   So he jumped the fence and came and gave Em a kiss. It was cute and all. They really do love each other alot, and I know she wants to be with him again, she just doesn't like all the drama with him, plus he parents would kill her too. But anyways we get back to my house, getting ready to watch movies and Em gets a call from Chris, he's had a wreck and he doesn't know where he is, so he wanted us to come get him. Well, then I had to explain everything to my dad about what happened and he wanted to come too, but he waited a bit. Well, since I know all the back roads and stuff back here, we found him fairly quickly, his car 200 feet out in the field, stuck between 2 trees, and he crawled on the way out to the road. I felt so bad for him just laying there, shaking. Some people stopped and called 911 and my parents came, and I sat next to him and talked to him trying to get him not to go to sleep, because we figured he had a concussion and that's the last thing he needed to be doing, while Em was talking to the people and police. Finally the ambulance showed up and we left. Then I got a huge lecture from my parents in the car. They were blaming the whole thing on me and Em, since if we didn't go out and get ice cream, we wouldn't of met him, he wouldn't of followed us out there, thus not getting into a wreck. Ok, yeah well number 1, he didn't have to follow us period and second he could of just went back down the main road back to the highway besides going down a dark, gravel, twisty road at night, in the fog and rain, I mean seriously people use some freaking common sense. Plus, I made another point that if I didn't go with Em she could of just gone with Chris and it would then both of them could of had a wreck. But of course I have a "bad attitude" and "no respect" so I get grounded and only get to drive my car to and from school, hey I was going to get everything taken away, car, phone, net. But I calmed down and apologized and realized where my parents were coming from, so I only got that. But my mom told me that if I do that one more time, the car goes period. So I'm going to be good, plus if I'm really, really good I'll get to go at spring break, so it's all good. The only reason I was really yelling at them last night, was because I was defending Em and myself and I didn't need all that, especially after what happened.   So I was really upset, like to the point of crying and I usually don't cry easily. I just wanted to hide under my covers and just make everything go away, I just wanted everything to end. But then things calmed down and I talked to David and he made me feel alot better, so everythings all good now :) If I didn't have him to talk to I probably would of resorted to my old ways and of done some stuff, but I don't do that anymore, yay! I've been really, really good. Whoa, its been exactly 2 months!!! And we've also been going out for 7 months exactly today, lol and also it's a year since I first registered at the millnet, whoa weird!!! That is whack! lol...    When you say that I'm one of a kind Baby, I don't see it but you believe

      I didn't go to school today, go me! Yea I woke up everything congested, sore throat, so I went back to bed, woke up around 10:30, then went back to sleep until about 2:30. Let's see, I missed turning in my theatre project and an Algebra test. Oh well, no worries. At least we had a sub in chem I heard, and I was only counted absent for 2 class periods, lol that looks real good. I feel better though, so I'll probably go to school tomorrow.   I'm just so sick of school and everything. You would think that being back in school would take my mind off things and be able to concentrate better, but no, it's actually harder. I want to be 18, I want to just be out on my own, away from my parents, and I know that as each day passes, it gets closer to that one day. It's just time doesn't seem to be going fast enough...No one really understands, Ritika ridicules me, calls me stupid blah blah, Kiera just sympathizes she really can't relate, Embry helps some, but she has her own problems right now, Rhonda doesn't understand at all, Dylan is like Kiera, etc.   Anyways I've always had an issue expressing my emotions/feelings to the people I love, I don't know why. I can't open up the true way I feel, which is why I always seem hyper and try to be funny. I don't let people know if I'm upset or mad, like on Sat night, I could of easily said something, but I didn't. Also, I can talk to Kiera all day about how much I love David and stuff, but when I get on the phone with him, I can't say any of it, I just freeze. Like during our akward silences, I'm thinking about what I want to say, you know, how much I love you and want to be together and my fears and stuff, BUT I CAN'T ON THE PHONE. That has been my worst thing, confrontation, I can say stuff over the net or text, but it's really hard for me to face to face or on the phone.  Maybe it's because I'm afraid of the reaction or sounding like an idiot. Typing things, you can't see or hear the other person, so it doesn't matter, but on the phone and stuff it's all out in the open. I guess I just need to work on this stuff, be more open with my feelings, try not to hide them, be able to express myself without worrying about what the other person might think.  I'm going to go talk to my GIR now, yeah that's right I talk to a stuffed robot in a dog costume, what now?! I love my GIR :)   Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together And I just wanna stay with you In this moment forever, forever and ever

      I'm so going to kill John and Arlo. They wanted me in their group so that we could read our essays and I didn't want to read mine, so Arlo fkn reads it, which is ok I guess, besides the fact they were acting like dicks and being guys, but still...It's ok they said they liked it, so no worries. But I didn't need to John to freaking yell out in class "you're dating a guy in Nebraska, that's 20 that you met on the net", :::class goes quite::: My face was bright red, then I had John Rajala ask me all the questions across the room and Jordan and Justin and Ms. Williams, I'm like people hello?! We've met no worries! Then since John (Rae) isn't done with his paper I was going to be like "hey John you need to finish your paper!" That blackmailed him and he was like naw naw, I made it up! Haha that's right baby! Actually I don't have a problem with people knowing, it's just the age difference, I think it's only illegal to have sex, but I'm not sure, anyways he's going to be 18 for now, lol. The only reason John knew about him in the first place it because him and Arlo are in my theatre class and me, Rhonda, and Dylan talk sometimes, and he sits by Dylan, so yeah, plus I'm loud and yeah...It was actually funny in a way, but all is forgotten now, llol oh wells... :)   I hate everything about you, why do I, love you?

I seriously don't know what's wrong with my parents, omg they've been getting on my nerves so much lately. If I say hello the freaking wrong way I get yelled at, seriously WTF? They need prozac or something, I've actually been good. Oh well, I need to act better I guess, hey I'm an actress I can pull it off, anyways I have no choice, especially when I want to go to Nebraska spring break. I can't wait!!! Being apart from the person you love the most in the world really sucks ALOT :(   Like in your eyes I see my future in an instant

      Well this day just went from bad to worse. I was already feeling depressed today, or yesterday I should say, and the only thing that would cheer me up is talking to David. So he said he would call, then he lost track of time and decided to go to bed, even though I stayed up just to talk to him, I was looking forward to it, hoping it'd cheer me up. Serisously, this made me feel even worse, it's like he doesn't want to talk to me, we didn't even talk Friday either. I don't think I've done anything wrong...I really needed to talk too, but it doesn't matter anymore, whatever...   Don't leave me in all this pain Come back and bring back my smile Come and take these tears away

      This morning I woke up sad, why? Because I woke up from one of the best dreams, even though I can vaguely recall everything, I remember the general idea and of course who was in the dream...Too bad I have this weird cold, stuffed up nose thing so I couldn't go back to sleep. But now all that is going to be on my mind today, trying to remember how I felt as compared to now and just wanting to go back to sleep to recapture it. Everything was so wonderful, so perfect...Then my phone got a text message and woke me up, argh. I had to get up sooner or later though, it was after 10:30. That's it my phone's going to be on quiet :/   I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like Do you know what it feels like? Cause with you I can let my hair down  I can say anything crazy I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground With nothing but a T-shirt on I never felt so beautiful Baby as I do now Now that I'm with you

      :::sigh::: so much to do, so little time, and yet I procasternate even more. Oh wells. Like I seriously need to clean my room, I CAN BARELY WALK THROUGH IT. I've tripped the past 2 nights on my shoes laying in the middle of the room, argh. Plus I have chem hw, 2 projects due next week for dance and theatre, german hw, and finally an expository essay for english, in which I have no clue in what to write about. Ms. Williams said it could be reflective but has to have sequencing, compare and contrast, anything basically that relates to expository writing. And I was thinking about writing an essay called, Saying Goodbye: How hard it really is. But I don't know, it might be too personal to write about, just because I really don't want to share my feelings with the whole class, certain people I don't mind, but not everyone. I'll write a rough draft and take it from there, I can always change it, it's not due until next Tuesday, I have like 4 days. PARTY TIME THIS WEEKEND!!!! :(   Maybe someday you'll really get to know me not just from letters read to you I pray I get the change to make it up to you We've got a lot of catching up to do

      This morning I was sitting in my car in the parking lot listening to this song, I don't exactly know why, but it has always been a special song to me, and now it has more meaning... Truly, Madly, Deeply~Savage Garden  I'll be your dream  I'll be your wish I'll be your fantasy  I'll be your hope I'll be your love  Be everything that you need  I'll love you more with every breath  Truly, madly, deeply do  I will be strong I will be faithful  'cause I'm counting on  A new beginning  A reason for living  A deeper meaning, yeah   I want to stand with you on  a mountain  I want to bathe with you in the sea  I want to lay like this forever  Until the sky falls down on me   And when the stars are shining  brightly in the velvet sky,  I'll make a wish send it to heaven  Then make you want to cry  The tears of joy for all the  pleasure in the certainty  That we're surrounded by the  comfort and protection of   The highest powers  In lonely hours  The tears devour you   Oh can you see it baby?  You don't have to close your eyes  'Cause it's standing right here  before you  All that you need will surely come   I'll be your dream I'll be your wish  I'll be your fantasy  I'll be your hope I'll be your love  Be everything that you need  I'll love you more with every breath  Truly, madly, deeply do   I want to stand with you on a  mountain  I want to bathe with you in the sea  I want to live like this forever  Until the sky falls down on me

      Yay another day goes by! I have no clue where that came from...For it being a B-day it was pretty easy and not as stressful as usual. I decided not to try out for the UIL competition of Macbeth. It's just that all the freaking varsity, senior people are going to get all the good parts and if I did make it, I'd get one of  those freaking no line parts where I am just sorta onstage randomly, I mean come on! I've had like one freaking lead role, I can handle it, but no I guess the turtle bitch Ms. Welch doesn't think so. Oh well, one day I'll prove it to them how good of an actress I am, especially when I have my oscar in one arm, haha beat that! Plus, I hate do Shakespeare =p!   Dude last night I got like so freaked out. I was literally burning up, I had to turn on the fan and kick off all the covers and stuff. I guess it was because of getting that pierced. Plus, I was kinda worried since I've heard it can cause hearing loss or paralysis, so yeah, it's all good now, I'm sure everything is fine. I know if I had one thing last night, it wouldn't have been so bad, everything would of been good and I wouldn't have freaked, because when I'm in David's arms I feel so safe that nothing can happen...   When you smile I can feel All my passion unfolding Your hand brushes mine And a thousand sensations

      Well Stefan dumped Embry today for freaking Heather fucking Morris. I sware to God that kid is fucked up. I mean they were fine the night before, then he comes up to her before 3rd period and says he doesn't feel the same anymore and broke up. Yeah because he likes a freakin slut. If he seriously knew how he made Embry feel he wouldn't of been such a jackass. Was he there when Embry found out the real reason and started crying? Did he comfort her? No, me, Kiera, and Danielle did. So techinally fuck him, he's not worth it. I hate it when guys do that, even though I can't relate, never being dumped for someone else. I've really only been dumped one time, and that was more on a mutual aspect and the other times I just broke up with them. Or I just I said no when I got asked out, lol yeah it's not that I didn't want a relationship, it was the guys.   But I've found a really great one now and I wouldn't give him up for anything in the world! I'm really happy I have him because he's better than most of the guys and I know that probably every girlfriend says this about their boyfriend, but with mine it's true, I never have to worry about any of this, and that's a great feeling :)  So in highlight of the night, we had a girls nite out! Went to CiCi's pizza, then we got some Ben and Jerry's Karamel Sutra and Haagen Daas Coffee ice cream, and a bag of big jet-puffed marshmellows, chips, salsa, and cokes, and drowned Embry's sorrow's in food and watched Office Space. Lol we had a camp fire with a freaking huge candle in the middle of the game room and roasted marshmellows, mmmm they were good. With my caramel ice cream that had a pure caramel core! woo! Yeah I'm so not eating for a week (sarcasm) lol maybe just for the weekend or something, because seriously I feel like throwing up, ahhh it's cool, IT WAS ALL WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!! BECAUSE IT WAS GOOD!! MMM Caramel and MARSHMELLOWS!!! And that was my night! Yay! "Dude I'm going show her my O face, O O O O" haha good stuff!    There has been no one brighter than you I can't deny these things that I do Feels like the world's at stake 'cause I have been waiting I have been waiting for you

      Yay, I talked to my parents and I'm pretty sure that all plans for spring break are all go! See, my mom will more than likely come with me and Kiera, and if my mom brings her cousin Janie then we'll drive, but if not we'll fly. I hope that she brings Janie, because that way me and Kiera will have the freedom to do more stuff, hehe. And I know that it's going to be kinda hard to explain David, so either he's going to be Bryan or I'll just tell my mom the truth, that he's my boyfriend. So yeah, I don't know yet, but I have 2 months to think about it.  Early today I kept thinking about us being together last week. I don't know whether it was the first night he was here or the second, but I remember him kissing my forehead before we went to bed, awww butterfly kisses, they're so sweet. I miss all that so much. Lol I get all teary eyed just thinking about that moment...I think this song will explain it all:  Touch~Seal  Without your touch I've been lost without the things I love Without your kiss I've been dreaming of the things I miss Your eyes, your mouth, your lips, your touch Your eyes, your mouth, your face, your touch Who am I (Who am I) I'm not to tell (I'm not to tell) Of what would be (of what would be) No one knows (Still) Who am I (I need to know) I'm not to tell (What time excel) What would be well (will really show) Let it be  Each day we miss I remember times I used to kiss Your mouth, your eyes, your face, your touch But who am I (Who am I) I'm not to tell (I'm not to tell) Of what would be (of what would be) No one knows (Still) Who am I (I need to know) I'm not to tell (What time excel) What would be well (will really show) Let it be  (Still, I need to know What time excel will really show Still, I need to know What time excel will really show)  And I say Who am I (Who am I) I'm not to tell (I'm not to tell) Of what would be well (of what would be) No one knows (Still) Who am I (I need to know) I'm not to tell (What time excel) What would be well (will really show) Let it be  Who am I (Who am I) I'm not to tell (I'm not to tell) Of what would be well (of what would be) No one knows (Still) Who am I (I need to know) I'm not to tell (What time excel) What would be well (will really show) Let it be  Your mouth, your eyes, your face, your touch Your touch Your touch Your touch Your touch

      Ahh I came home and slept again! Yea but it wasn't as long. I guess my allergies just make me sleepy or something, I don't know.   You know somethings in life surprise me. I was never expecting any of this, I mean seriously about this time last year I was about to give up on guys and the pricks that they turn out to be. But now, I realize that there are some guys out there that are different from the others. They're sensitive, caring, they're perfectly fine just laying with you, looking in your eyes, than trying to get in your pants. They make you feel special, that you're the only girl for them, and how you get all tingly just thinking about them or them touching you. I wish I could have that all back, even if it was just for a moment...Sometimes during class I'll zone out and think about last week, and what all happened, then I get the butterflies in my tummy and this tingly sensation, then as quick as it comes, it's gone...  I know that a year and a half isn't that far off, and I don't mind waiting, because in the end all of it will be worth it. I have never been in this serious of a relationship before, most were short lived, lol my longest being like 4 months, then a few crushes, which that turned out to be disasterous (shut up Ritika). So really all this is new to me too.  I've never felt this way before, it's all new, yet so exciting, like I don't know what's going to happen. It's almost like the rush I get from being on stage.  What hurts the most though, since we can't be together right now, is seeing other people together. I know how that feels now with him, holding hands, kissing, laying on one another, staring in each other's eyes, the scent of his cologne, even today I was remembering rubbing my nose against his...it was so soft...so was his hands. i wish I could have all that back, and I will eventually...hopefully asap, there's always spring break, possibly the summer, I mean if I get a job instead of buying clothes, I'll just save it for plane tickets, lol. I just wish I could tell my parents, I mean it's not that big of a deal anymore, since we've met, but I don't know coming up with how, is another issue.  I know I shouldn't be saying this, I know I'm only 16 (almost 17 bitches!) but I love David so much, I want to be with him forever...he makes me so happy, he's helped me in so many ways he could hardly imagine. Just knowing I have someone there who cares for me and will be there whenever, I couldn't ask for anything else...   Without your touch I've been lost without the things I love Without your kiss I've been dreaming of the things I miss Your eyes, your mouth, your lips, your touch

      Yay!!! Btw, lol I've had some alcohol, lol Bud Light, this is what I get for going to my sis's. She told me I could come over one night and get wasted lol, hmmm I don't know...If I do Kiera and Embry will be right along with me! Yeah today was alot better than the past 2 days, dance is actually fun! And I have a 100 in german and dance, woo go me! That'll probably go down though, hehe.   Well today I've made an important decision, and I think I'm going to audition for Juilliard, yeah I know it's probably a total long shot, but I won't know unless I try. And I know that I really want to go into flim and television and this is mostly for performance arts, like broadway and stuff, I don't care anymore, it's acting and no matter if it's live or taped, it's the experience that counts. So this means that I've got to find 2 monolouges, one classical, one contemporary, memorize them, perfect them, and then either fly to Chicago or New York for the audition. I told my parents, I think they think I'm messing with them or something, but really I want to do this, and if I don't get in I'll just go to either UT or UNL, since going to UCLA would be too far, and it would complicate things alot more. I have like a year though, so it gives me  time to practice and stuff. Wooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   The smile on your face lets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me A touch of your hand says you'll catch me where ever I fall Now you say it best ... when you say nothing at all

      WOOOOO I LOVE FREAKING HIGH SCHOOL DRAMA!!!!!! AHHHH RELATIONSHIPS, GUYS, GIRLS, SEX, ETC. I so cannot wait till college, not only can we have all this, but we can get drunk and high and do it with other people! Anyways, Ms. Welch is a fucking bitch, this morning she was getting all over me, then I wanted to go to the library to work on our playwright project, and earlier she was talking about people majoring in theatre so I go up to her and I'm like yeah I'm going to major in theatre and she was like yeah you told me that once, but you know Ashley it's really hard and I think that if you don't get into alot of plays at school you can always do after school stuff. JESUS LIKE I SUCK THAT BAD, THANKS FOR RUINING MY DREAMS BITCH. Ahhh today is a day where I'm just like pissed at the world. Don't even get me started on Rhonda, you know not everyone can be perfect and really enough is enough. IT'S NOT THAT BAD. I got a cold too :(, yes I feel like bitching, and yes this is my blog, so I get to, and if you don't like it, press the freaking X button. One good thing about today, I'm getting my schedule changed to back to my old english class so that's good. Plus I mailed David our pics and a Bday card! Yay, I hope he like 'em. Ok, well I gotta a buttload of homework that I guess I'll do though I'm not in the mood, but whatever it's just german =p!   The first time ever I kissed your mouth I felt the earth move thru my hand

      lol Oh man, I've been so out of it today! First off, this morning I ran into my dad's truck and knocked my bumper in a bit, it didn't dent it, and it's hardly noticable, lol but I still can't believe I did that. Then in history this morning, me and Em were texting each other since we're not in english together anymore :( and Coach Welock saw it and changed the freaking language to Japanese, at least there was a girl in there that knew it, so I got it fixed, lol but still that was gay. Then I had dance, dude my teacher counted me absent! Lol I think it was because I introduced myself as Ashley Wilson instead of Carroll, but still I'm the only Wilson in the class, it's not that hard to put 2 and 2 together, but whatever, teachers at North are dumbasses. Then I was driving up my drive way today and I took the corner too fast and did a complete circle in the driveway! lol whoops my bad, today has just not been my day. Then just now I was talking to Lauren and I thought it was Lauren Brandon, lol but it was Lauren Wilson, I seriously need to go back to bed or something, I don't know what is wrong with me! I think I need David back, lol that might help ALOT...Brr it's cold here! Stupid Texas weather!    I hear your name whispered on the wind  It's a sound that makes me cry  I hear a song blow again and again through my mind

      I wish this last week could of just lasted forever...And now that we've been together, we're so much closer, it's like we can share anything now. I mean we have a true relationship now, and that has got to be one of the greatest things. I was reading someone else's blog yesterday and I found this:   "The romantics like to say that you know you're in love when the hardest thing to say is 'goodbye'. It's interesting to think that perhaps there is just one person out there completely meant for you and nothing, not hell or high water, will come between you and them and your fate to be in each others' arms for the rest of eternity."   And I know that in reality this usually doesn't occur. But after spending time with David and just being with him, I believe it. I really think that you shouldn't have an opinon unless you've been through it. How do you know there isnt just that one person out there for you. They could be right in front of you and you'd never know...I know I'm only 16 and that I'm probably too young to be in love or to say that I've found "The One", but you know what, it doesn't matter what age you are and others might put you down for being naive, but they don't know how this feels, the exhilaration I feel, the butterflies, the bond. As long as you find your love and they make you happy, then nothing else matters...  It barely has been 2 days and I miss his touch, his kiss, his lips, I love the way he made me feel while he was around...And for now, that's all gone. But I know deep in my heart, that we will be together again and soon and eventually, hopefully one day we can be together forever...I never want to have to leave the person that I love again....  "The romantics like to say that you know you're in love when the hardest thing to say is 'goodbye'."   I could stay awake just to hear you breathing Watch you smile while you are sleeping While you're far away and dreaming I could spend my life in this sweet surrender I could stay lost in this moment forever Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

      Well the week is over, :::sigh::: I wish it could of lasted longer... David came on Tuesday and just left this afternoon. We had an OSOME time, hehe. But the worst thing was him leaving today. If only I could stay in his arms a little longer, the whole time we were waiting for the bus I was trying so hard not to cry, then once he got on I went into my car and just cried, I couldn't help it, then I basically cried all the way home, lol I know I got some looks but I didn't care. Now that I'm back home it's really hard because I can still smell his colonge on my bed and pillows, on my clothes, and in my car. I think this has got to be one of the hardest things I've ever had to do...I miss him so much, I wish we could just lay in each other's arms forever, :::sigh::: maybe one day...but until then I guess the next time we can see each other would be at Spring Break and maybe even during the summer, so those are some positive outlooks. These past 3 days have been the best ever...David, sweetie, I love you so much and I hope that one day we can just be together and we'll never have to leave one another again...  How do I get through a night without you? How do I live without you? What kind of life would this be?

      Well this week was FUN, let me tell you! I've had this weird stomach virus thing since sunday night and, I've gotten blood drawn and got to pee in a cup and they still don't know what's wrong. And for those of you that have never pissed in a cup, let me tell you how fun that is! Ohh man goodtimes. Most akward moment of the week. Now I think I'm getting better, hey as long as I don't eat solid foods I'm good.   Woo! only like 4 more days till I go see David, yay! I need to go to sleep, lol. YAY kiera's over. Say hi Kiera, hey y'all. YAY!!!!  ok bye bye   I wish like hell I could go back in time Maybe then I could see how Forgiveness says that I should give you one more try But it's too late, it's over now

      Well today started really good. I got a fucking speeding ticket on a fucking Farm Rd. going to school. Yea, I was doing 67 mph in a 55. But, it was the way the state trooper treated me that really pisses me off. I was nice, I gave him my license and insurance, and I smiled and I nicely asked him if he could let me off with a warning, I told him I had this huge grauation test to take and that I didn't need this on my shoulders. What does he do? Ignore every fucking thinG I say, and gives me the ticket. At least I don't have to pay the ticket, I just have to pay $25 for the defensive driving course, but I still have to go in front of a judge none the less. But, once I read the ticket I had realized that he put down a "M" under the gender part. Yeah, last time I checked I didn't have a dick and that I was a female. I'm sure he just made a mistake, but the fact of the matter is, it offends me and yet the ticket is still VALID. Stupid fucking mexican can't fucking read and tell apart genders needs to go back to fucking mexico. Ok, yeah, I'm being racist, at this point, I don't fucking care. It's the principle. I've always hated cops, especially state troopers (childhood incident) even though a lot of my family are state troopers, they still can go fuck themselves. I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, EMPHATICALLY HATE STATE TROOPERS. And all I have to say is that when I go to court, the judge is going to get a few words. Yes, I have a big mouth, but I don't care. I have a good arguement. If the cop can't comprehend the difference in gender and in letters, then how can he tell if I was speeding? It's his word against mine and he seems to be a dumbass. I nearly said to him, "so how much commisson do you get for this?" I'm sure that wouldn't of started anything. So in closing I hate asshole state troopers, DIE.     Today I woke up and you were gone  The whole day wondering what I did wrong

      SnOW is FuN...except when you have a snowball fight in the house and you slip and fall on the tile while on the phone with your boyfriend and now you have this huge knotty looking blue bruise on your leg. Fun stuff yo. It happens!   Wow, I'm so bored and even though I have aLOt of homework, I'm not going to do it. At this point, I really don't care anymore.  So I read  Girl with the Pearl Earring , it is really good. I can't wait to see the movie. I love the sex parts, lol, they're so suttle yet detailed. It's CrAZy. At least I have my ROR book read. Now, I just have to finish reading  The Great Gatsby . Learn my lines for theatre, do this Alg 2 worksheet that I don't know how to do, and couldn't even do it because I don't have a graphing calculator, and write my pre-lab for chemistry. All I gotta say is, "I don't wanna!"   Turning and returning to some secret place to hide  Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say  Take my breath away

      I sware if I see another person with a carnation or a rose, or hugging or kissing, or holding hands, Ima gonna beat something. Not that I'm bitter about it, lol. I have that special someone, I just can't be with them at the moment :( Only 20 more days...  So I'm trying to choreograph a lyrical dance to Justin Timberlake's "Never Again" it's actually a really good song, and I just really like lyrical dances and hip hop, but lryical are more emotional and they interpret alot better. I have come to really like dancing, I'm even thinking about taking some outside dance classes like ballet and modern, that should be fun. I miss swimming though, but it's just not going to fit into my schedule. Plus, dancing helps out alot in theatre. You usually have to act well, sing well, and dance well, I can act and sing, but I always was afraid to dance, now I'm not and it's really fun, so woo woo!  Valentines plan tomorrow, me and Kiera, eating chocolate and watching movies, prefreably Office Space? :)   Funny how a few words turn into sex

      Ok, things are better for the most. Earlier today after I came home from doing my all night babysitting at Candace's I was just not in the mood for any of my mom's crap. After spending 24 freaking hours with Kayla and Christian, I wanted to rest, sleep, have peace and quiet, I was already upset for the most and then they came home with me. So I got yelled at because of my "attitude" and how I was going to get my car taken away, blah blah. That was it, I don't know why, but I just started crying right there, I think after holding everything in for the past month or so I just let it all out. Then of course my mom wants to know what's wrong, like I could really tell her. I mean I told her alot of things that were bothering me, but not all of it. I just told her about how everyone dumps alot of their problems on me, which I don't mind at all, I love to help, but sometimes all of it is too much, plus I'm hardly ever allowed to be/talk with Kiera right now, and that hurts alot, because whenever I need someone she's there and for now she's not. Then alot of it has to do with theatre. I keep getting shut out, I got casted in Arlo's play with the majority of the sophomores instead of being with Rhonda, John, Jimmy, Allison, and Dylan in the other play. And the fact that I don't ever get to show my potential really pisses me off, I don't want to bash anyone or anything, but why why why does Rhonda get all the freaking lead parts?! Seriously, when I get these little sucky parts it really puts me down, like I'm not good enough. Sometimes I just think of dropping out of theatre all together and doing something more practical with my life. But I really want to be famous and do movies and SNL and maybe when an oscar. So I'm going to put on a freaking happy face and go out there and give it all I got, at least that has to be worth something.    I just wanna stay and hold you tight Feels so right no matter what we do I'm just gonna keep on loving you

      omg I hate myself so freaking much. I seriously must have a phone phobia or something. Because yesterday I had been upset all day about what Arlo had said and then I had a little fight with my parents, so I was pretty down and yet, when I got on the phone instead of talking about how I really felt, I was freaking hyper, happy go-lucky, bouncing off the walls, cracking jokes, etc. Why do I hide how I feel? I mean I can easily type it out, or even tell in person, but on the phone it's different, it's like I really can't be myself. I can't show if I'm upset about something and that really bothers me. I should be able to open up, but it is hard to me too. Then when I can't and I sit there in silence, waiting for the courage just to say it, they have to go, and it annoys me because I need to talk, yet I can't get it out. I guess I shouldn't expect them to actually read my mind, and they'd never know, since I never show any other emotions except being hyper. And sometimes it's not even a matter of being upset, sometimes I want to express how I really feel like I do in texts and I can't. It's hard for me to seriously be emotional.  And I can't blame anyone except me. I don't know what to do...  On a happier note, I had a really good dream last night, a dream I've been waiting to have for like a month and I had it. All the feelings, making out, etc. But it still didn't make me feel any better, like it does a little, but not as much as it should.   When I was fallin' down You would pick me up

      I hate it when you have something on your mind that you really need to tell this person, but you don't want to. It's not that it's anything bad, but it upsets you alot.   It's all about John and Arlo, more so Arlo, because I know that John is joking and he's actutally a pretty caring person, Arlo on the other hand is an ASSHOLE. But today during lunch, since I sit with the theatre people, Arlo sits there and of course ever since he had to read my essay in english he's been giving me a hard time about my relationship. I understand that meeting on person on the net might not of been the smartest thing, but it wasn't like I was looking and going into chat rooms, it was an accident, not that I regret it, I'm just saying is all. But, when you go so low as to Arlo calling me stupid and pathetic. I know I shouldn't let this get to me, it didn't, but after things are said over and over, it just pisses me off. And the fact that he brings he other people in it, people I don't know really well who don't know anything about me. So it's really hard to defend myself. I mean Arlo sitting there talking to me about how pathetic I am and how sad he if for me, and also that I shouldn't trust anything because he's in college and you know we're like miles apart so yeah. And plus that it isn't even a real relationship since we've been going out for 7 months and we've been together 4 days. Ok, he barely knows me and my life, and he doesn't know my boyfriend so he shouldn't even have an opinon. And it just upsets me because he thinks he's so right and he's not. I trust David so much and he's the best guy in the world and I love him so much, there's not a doubt in my mind that he would ever do anything that Arlo is insintuating. I just want Arlo to shut up!! And stop freaking putting me down, it's my LIFE, I live it how I want to, so why should anything matter to him? He's probably just jealous because no one likes him because he's a stupid bastard, asshole, jerk, etc.  BTW, after going thorugh my past blog entries and realizing how gay they are, I'm going to make Ritika's dream come true and just silt my wrists and die.    my God my tourniquet return to me salvation

      And I'd give up forever to touch you 'Cause I know that you feel me somehow You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be And I don't want to go home right now  And all I can taste is this moment And all I can breathe is your life 'Cause sooner or later it's over I just don't want to miss you tonight  And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming Or the moment of truth in your lies When everything feels like the movies Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive  And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  I just want you to know who I am

      ~You'll Think Of Me  keith urban  I woke up early this morning around 4am With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms I've been tryin' my best to get along But that's OK There's nothing left to say, but  Take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need'em Take your space and take your reasons But you'll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me, you'll think of me  I went out driving trying to clear my head I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this And all the baggage that seems to still exist It seems the only blessing I have left to my name Is not knowing what we could have been What we should have been  Someday I'm gonna run across your mind Don't worry, I'll be fine I'm gonna be alright While you're sleeping with your pride Wishing I could hold you tight I'll be over you  And on with my life  And you're gonna think of me Oh someday baby, someday

      I really think I'm coming down with something. I feel so bad and I'm really dizzy for some strange reason, like during the NHS meeting I nearly feel over because suddenly the room began to spin, oh well. Maybe it's all the Robitussin I've been taking, but it really hasn't helped my cough anyways. I guess it's just the weather that is making me all congested and stuff, I just want it to be summer already! :(   Lately I've been jaded life got so complicated

It's ok though, it's what is in NE that I can't wait to go ;) I just hope Kiera can go with me, since all that happened, I don't know if her parents will say yes, they better, because without her, then I don't know if I can go, but no worries.

But it'll get better eventually, I was just sick of wearing that fake diamond ring, so I put my barbell through it, lol it looks so like me! Not really, I just need to get some different colored balls for it.  YAy SuPERboWl TiME!!! Let's all confrom to society and watch this American football tradition!   But when you touch me like this And if you kiss me like that And you hold me like that I just have to admit That it's all coming back to me When I touch you like this And I hold you like that it was so long ago but its all coming back to me now

      Wee, it's my blog! Wee, I just got 3 hours of sleep! Now, I can work on my paper for english that is due on Friday. Ah, man tomorrow night and Thursday is going to suck. 3 district assessments all in a row, 3 I HAVE to study for, because since those things are freaking tricky and they're a test grade, so I wanna do good.  I had a good dream last night :) It was perfect, too bad it was only a dream...  Actually, I just had a weird dream about Austin. It was like he was still alive, just hanging out, talking and laughing. But he was with us, though we knew he was dead...Then we all got up and left to go meet somewhere and I realized that even though physically he was there and stuff, he really wasn't, so in my dream I started crying. That's when I woke up. So now I'm sad :(   I don't think I'll ever understand Why you love me Why you love me just like I am

      I wish it was Friday, I don't wanna go to school tomorrow, I just wanna sleep :( And I want it to be May, but it's only March so that sucks. And I really don't think I'm going to go to prom now. Kiera has a date, Em has a date and plus after the dance no ones going home so everyone is going to hang out all night and I don't feel like being a 5th wheel. So from what my mom thinks, I'm not going. I'll just sit at home, eat some ben and jerrys and watch office space and maybe super troopers.

      Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show I laced the track, you locked the flow So far from hangin on the block for dough Notorious, they got to know that Life ain't always what it seem to be  Words can't express what you mean to me Even though you're gone, we still a team Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream  In the future, can't wait to see If you'll open up the gates for me Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend Try to black it out, but it plays again When it's real, feelings hard to conceal Can't imagine all the pain I feel Give anything to hear half your breath  I know you still living your life, after death   Every step I take, every move I make Every single day, every time I pray I'll be missing you Thinkin of the day, when you went away What a life to take, what a bond to break I'll be missing you  It's kinda hard with you not around  Know you in heaven smilin down  Watchin us while we pray for you Every day we pray for you Til the day we meet again In my heart is where I'll keep you friend Memories give me the strength I need to proceed Strength I need to believe My thoughts Big I just can't define  Wish I coul turn back the hands of time Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks You and me taking flicks Makin hits, stages they receive you on Still can't believe you're gone  Give anything to hear half your breath  I know you still living you're life, after death   One glad morning When this life is over I know I'll see your face  Austin, you could always make me laugh...I'll miss you...

      ~Smile  Smile though your heart is aching; Smile even though it's breaking. When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by. If you smile through your fear and sorrow, Smile and maybe tomorrow, You'll see the sun come shining through for you.  Light up your face with gladness, Hide every trace of sadness. Although a tear may be ever so near, That's the time you must keep on trying, Smile, what's the use of crying? You'll find that life is still worthwhile, If you just smile.  That's the time you must keep on trying, Smile, what's the use of crying? You'll find that life is still worthwhile If you just smile

      Well...Ritika, you won the bet...DAMMIT! I was wrong this once!  I just wanna feel whole again, I wanna feel you next to me...holding me, looking in my eyes, telling me everything is perfect and as long as I am with you nothing bad can ever happen...I feel lost, like I don't belong here anymore. Everything is different, it seems to have change. No matter what I do, I keep thinking about last weekend and how I loved every moment. Now that's all gone and I don't know what to do...I just want us to be together again and never have to say goodbye...   However far away I will always love you

      yay I get to go to the doctor again tomorrow, fun! Yea, see I came home yesterday with a seriously bad tummy ache, which is my new nickname, lol. So my mom was like I can't believe we let you go up there like that, because it was bothering me up there a lil bit. Now, my mom like it's been over 2 weeks, it could be something serious and is getting worse. My philosophy was, hey if it bothers me in Texas then it'll bother me in Nebraska and I'd rather spend my time there. So, I get to go tomorrow and get all these tests done and yeah, I'm gonna have fun...   Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain  But I'd of had to miss the dance

      Last night was so hard, it was the first night in four nights that I had been away from David. I missed him so much. I missed having his arms around me while I fell asleep and then waking up next to him. So this morning when I woke up, I was saddened, because he wasn't there, I am back home and it sucks. I wanted to start crying, but I knew if I did, I don't think I'd be able to stop. It's just that I don't feel like I belong here, I just want to be with him again and it's hard to get used to him not being around...   I just wanna hold you close  But so far all I have a dreams of you

      Wow, what to say about this weekend. The best time of my life. Words cannot begin to describe everything that happened and all the feelings. Everything was so perfect. The first night we met as we kissed in the rain to the last time we were together, standing outside his dorm, holding on to one another, neither of us not wanting to let go. I just wanted to stay in this moment forever. On Sunday night, it was I think one of the best times. It was so cute, just messing with each other and joking around. All that was going through my head was not wanting tomorrow to come. Which then reminded of the Garth Brooks song, "If Tomorrow Never Comes", because then I wouldn't have to leave...Walking away this morning was so hard. But I knew that if I had looked back I wouldn't of been able to leave.    If tomorrow never comes...

      I seriously need to pack, I'm so bad at that. I just wait to the last possible moment lol. Well, my stomach's still bothering me a bit, but I'm not going to let in ruin anything, it's not as bad as it was, so maybe it'll go away. So a little over 24 hours to go, woo! I hope we get there early enough so I can still see David, but I don't know, my sis was like, it'll probably be around midnight. So I dunno. Yay, time to pack! Great, now if I had any actual decent clothes...Well they're nice looking, just not on me! =p    Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game  On this endless ocean finally lovers know no shame  Turning and returning to some secret place inside  Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say   Take my breath away

      YAY, only 2 more days until I get to see my David! Wow, I thought this week was going to be really tough. I had a german test, a chem test, an alg 2 test, a rough draft of my argumentation paper for english due, and The Great Gatsby read, plus a line test for theatre. Well ALL my english stuff got pushed back until after spring break as well did my chem test and line test. So, all I have to worry about now is my alg 2 test, which should be fairly easy and I already took my german test on Monday. Lol, I didn't even know we had one until yesterday morning since I was absent and I still took it and made an 87, what what! Too bad this means alot of work over spring break, well not a whole lot, but some.   Dude, seriously whatever stomach thing I have needs to go away. I think it's getting better, maybe? Sometimes it hurts when I eat, not as severe, but I think I'm getting used to it. I wonder if I'm like lactose intolerance or something, since it seems to hurt only when some sort of dairy is involved, I don't know. I suppose I won't eat any dairy for a few days and see what happens.   Time to finish my english quiz I got to take home, woo woo!    Don't waste your time on me you're already  A voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)

      YAY TAKS is over!!! Weee! Ahhh I still have the AP test on Monday...ugh, is it too late to commit suicide?  So I found out from Lanni that Tyler didn't die instantly...You know, I think from what all I heard today from Lanni, it has finally hit me. I just wanted to start crying during class. It's so hard to just go outside and see what a pretty day it is and realize that Tyler, Austin, and Matt will never see any of this again...It just seems to be on my mind alot, like I'll think about everything that has happened and just forget my surroundings. Like today, I was sitting at a red light, just thinking and the other light from under the bridge was green and I was not paying attention and I nearly just went out in oncoming traffic. And yesterday, I pulled out in front of this car that was 6 feet away going about 50 mph, it freaked me out so much, I started shaking so bad that I was swerving a bit in the other lane. I don't know what's wrong with me. I wish I could forget about all of this, or at least turn back time and prevent it. But, I can't and it sucks.   Assumed you'd always be there I took your presence for granted

      I hate TAKS...You know, I feel that I should go to the funeral tomorrow, but I don't know, it just doesn't feel right. Yeah, he was in my english class but other than that I never really talked to him and stuff. It's sad though, to lose another life, he was a good kid. Quiet kid, lol "goofy". "SWEDISH PRIDE"  ONLY 15 MORE DAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   So I should keep this to myself And never let you know I could fall in love with you

      Another tradegy...I know it doesn't get any easier, it's just so shocking and so close to Matt and Austin's murders. All in the junior class...it's just unexplainable. I know that alot people are probably asking themselves why God would let 2 horribles tradegies happen so close together. I wish I knew tha answer too. But this one verse always comforts me whenever I'm in doubt or sad over a loss:   There is a time for everything,  and a season for every activity under heaven:  a time to be born and a time to die,  a time to plant and a time to uproot,  a time to kill and a time to heal,  a time to tear down and a time to build,  a time to weep and a time to laugh,  a time to mourn and a time to dance,  a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,  a time to embrace and a time to refrain,  a time to search and a time to give up,  a time to keep and a time to throw away,  a time to tear and a time to mend,  a time to be silent and a time to speak,  a time to love and a time to hate,  a time for war and a time for peace.

      I said I wanna touch the earth  I wanna break it in my hands  I wanna grow something wild and unruly  I wanna sleep on the hard ground  In the comfort of your arms  On a pillow of blue bonnets  In a blanket made of stars  Oh it sounds good to me I said   Cowboy take me away  Fly this girl as high as you can  Into the wild blue  Set me free oh I pray  Closer to heaven above and  Closer to you closer to you   I wanna walk and not run  I wanna skip and not fall  I wanna look at the horizon  And not see a building standing tall  I wanna be the only one  For miles and miles  Except for maybe you  And your simple smile  Oh it sounds good to me I said  It sounds so good to me

      You know, I was expecting to wake up forgetting all that was said last night. But no, it's all still there, still making wonder why. I mean, it's good that he can be open, but I still don't fully understand why he would think that. I was completely fine until last night. We have done alot of things out of *bed*, but knowing a guy they wouldn't remember. We only get to see one another a few days every couple of months, that's not enough time to do everything, both hanging out and other stuff, it was pretty balanced to me. So now, I'm really not wanting to do anything in May, like that, even though I was looking forward to all those things that we do in *bed*, but now it just seems it would be different...

        urlLink     urlLink How evil are  you ?    yay...I think? But I like to be a bitch sometimes! lol, to people I don't like or when somethings not fair...  Like today, I finally stood up to Welch and I stood up for myself and this other girl. I'm so sick of seeing people getting put down then having to feel like crap. It's ridiculous, people shouldn't be treated this way. And from now on I am going to stand up for myself and others. I don't care what other people think or anything, call me a bitch I don't care, I'm just doing what is right. And it feels good. You know, I might stay in theatre, it depends, if I make north stars or not, if I do, then I might be able to stay in the class but not do so much extra curricular plays, but if I don't then back to theatre. I'm not going to let this run me out of theatre, I can prove to them I'm just as good being in JV as being in Varsity, and you know, some people are moving, so there's a chance I can get moved up. I think, that this will show Welch, I'm not going to stand in the shadows anymore, but I'm going to be heard. I believe everything happens for a reason and maybe this whole thing was to teach me not to hold back, but stand up and be heard. And dammit, I will! :)   Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms When the world outside's too Much to take That all ends when I'm with you

      so yeah, alot has happened in a week. Didn't make freaking varsity theatre, I basically gave up 2 years for nothing...oh well, something good will come from all of this.  so  there's alot of people I can't stand, those who overshadow others and always have to be the center of ATTENTION. I just don't care anymore...But anyways, things are looking good for being on the North Stars. They need about 40 girls for the team, so hopefully I'll make it and Ms. Gibson is so totally awesome.   Wow, I just got done laughing for about 30 min, I got called EMO!!!!!!!!!!! ahahahaha my life is now complete, I can die happy!   so we danced on the floor and around

      Can't fall asleep tonight I don't know what to do I hold my pillow but I want to be holding you And when I close my eyes  I always see you face I know my happiness is only a kiss away And every hour here in the dark  Every beat of my lonely heart  Tells me that I need to be with you  Heaven oh Heaven what can I do?   Heaven, oh heaven can't you help me? I'm down on my knees, please help me

      OMG, I'm going to go out of my mind! All I wanted was ONE day, one day to just sleep late and chill. Since I have to be at school tomorrow from like 10-4, then work on day Sunday, then have rehearsals, NHS service hours, my varsity audition, dress rehearsals, and the actual show. So, I'm going to be pretty much busy ALL week. So, in saying that, my mom has to call this morning and freaking bitch me out just because I didn't want to keep the kids for one time in my life. But she's all like, oh well it's the way you said it. WTF? What way do you want me to say it? I sware I'm going to go insane. And then Candace has to yell at me too, saying I never do anything, I'm always watching her freaking kids. She's the one who needs to spend more time with them, not me! Then my mom is threatning to take away my cell and net just because. I'm so sick of all of this. I just got under my covers and pillow this morning and just cried.

      I was lying in bed and I was thinking about today and the things that happened and I just had to get this out, if not I'm going to go insane.  First off, a fight with Kiera. I did not need this, nothing would of happened if it wasn't for Embry, I mean I don't need to be yelled at for something I can't control. Now, Kiera and Embry are fighting which puts me in the middle, great. Just what I wanted, now I get to hear them back and forth talking about each other.  And to top that off, my parents are fighting and I'm put in the middle again. I don't care about their freaking issues, if they have problems with each other freaking talk with the other person and stop making me play monkey in the middle. Like tonight, my mom is upset with my dad because he didn't ask her to come with him. I finally just told her to get freaking over it and get on with life. It's not that big of a deal. Plus, I don't care about their problems, I have enough of my own. And that shut her up.   Speaking of my mom, I HATE her so much. She is always critizing me, I will never be good enough for this woman. I'm sorry if I'll never be a freaking size 2, let me just kill myself now...It's always you shouldn't wear that or you shouldn't eat that. Well since I already have eating issues anyways, Ritika and Kiera know, they've talked to me about it, lol Ritika said if I didn't eat she'd beat me up. But I've been better about it lately... Kiera's actually seen firsthand how much of a nazi my mom can be. Kiera was spending the night last week and she had some candy, that was hers and not mine, and my mom comes upstairs and takes it away and is like you're not eating this blah blah. It wasn't even mine! And then last week I go in to give her a hug before I go to school and I know, I really don't hug all that well. So my mom asks, how does David hug? And I was like really good, he'll sometimes lift me off the floor. And she goes, well then you need to lose some weight then. I was like wtf, then she was like, well you have to be skinny for someone to pick you up, you'd have to weigh like 100 lbs. Then she tries to be like ohh I didn't mean it like that, anyways you're to sensitive. I beginning to realize why I'm so self conscious is because of her...  I just wish I could disappear for a while...  The only thing that truly makes me happy in my life, is David, he has got to be the most perfect guy. Sometimes I think he deserves better, I shouldn't have such a wonderful guy.  Wow, it feels pretty good to get this all out, it's just been inside, hidden by the happy mask I always put on. Which 99.9% I am happy go lucky, but sometimes all this gets to me. I think it's just this time in the month, I get kinda depressed and just wanna let things out...

      ahhhh I want May to be here...I want to get out all these freaking things I wanna do ;) May is going to be so awesome! Swimming...movies...etc. I just wish I didn't always have to wait. At least in the long run it's all going to be worth it. And waiting every few months is worth it too. I'd take any length of time to be with David, no matter how short it might be, as long as I can look in those beautiful dark brown eyes and run my fingers through his soft hair...and kiss his lips...everything is worth it...   I never felt so beautiful Baby as I do now Now that I'm with you

      (Maybe he's right. Maybe there is something the matter with me. I just don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad.)  Look at this stuff Isn't it neat? Wouldn't you think my collection's complete? Wouldn't you think I'm the girl The girl who has everything? Look at this trove Treasures untold How many wonders can one cavern hold? Looking around here you think Sure, she's got everything I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty I've got whozits and whatzits galore You want thingamabobs? I've got twenty! But who cares? No big deal I want more  I wanna be where the people are I wanna see, wanna see them dancin' Walking around on those - what do you call 'em? Oh - feet!  Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far Legs are required for jumping, dancing Strolling along down a - what's that word again? Street  Up where they walk, up where they run Up where they stay all day in the sun Wanderin' free - wish I could be Part of that world  What would I give if I could live out of these waters? What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand? Bet'cha on land they understand That they don't reprimand their daughters Bright young women sick of swimmin' Ready to stand  I'm ready to know what the people know Ask 'em my questions and get some answers What's a fire and why does it - what's the word? Burn?  When's it my turn? Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above? Out of the sea Wish I could be Part of that world   What would I give to live where you are What would I pay to stay here beside you What would I do to see you smiling at me   Where would we walk? Where would we run? If we could stay all day in the sun  Just you and me  And I could be Part of your world  I don't know when I don't know how But I know something's starting right now  Wait and you'll see Someday I'll be part of your world   I love the Little Mermaid! :)

      wow, today was well horrific...It's completely unimaginable. I, sitting a red light waiting to turn, got slammed into by a huge delivery type truck. I remember hearing it hit the curb and seeing it bounce, and slammed into my side. Then my car hit a concrete edge and flipped over into a 10-12ft ditch. I was screaming the whole time, it is the most scariest thing to live through. And the fact that I couldn't control it, that it was unavoidable freaks me out to no end. I'm just so thankful that I'm ok. When I got hit so many things ran through my mind, not that I was going to die, I knew I'd be fine, but just how to tell my parents and David, and how my car was ruined! While in the ambulance I had sort of a revelation, I laid there and I knew that God was watching over me ALOT and that I had to of had an angel with me. I know I'm lucky and this has just been a life changing experience for me. The only thing now, is I keep picturing the whole thing over and over again. I'm afraid that if I go to sleep I'll have to re-live it again, and that scares me the most.    I don't wanna close my eyes I don't wanna fall asleep Cause I'd miss you, baby

      Only 3 more days of school left!! Woo! Yeah, so I'm psyched.   Also, I'm just in a really good mood :) Probably because I got a really sweet card today :) It's like what the person writes or says is absolutely perfect...and it leaves you speechless. I mean I try to explain the feelings, but sometimes I just can't. They're all in my head, but I get so excited it all comes out weird, lol. This next year is going to be so hard, because I want to go ahead and be with him. In reality, it's not that long, it seems long because you want to spend as much time as you can with the person you love. At least we'll have alot more opportunities for that. I can't wait to go to college and be on my own...Especially being able to see my Davey anytime I want and being together. :) I love you Davey! ::kisses::   The tears of joy for all the pleasure in the certainty  That we're surrounded by the comfort and protection of  The highest powers  In lonely hours

      Woo! Only have to be at school for 2 and half hours tomorrow, rock on. So yeah, summer, 4 days away I can't wait. Get to sleep in...Watch all the tv I want and have some real ME time...I like being by myself, every once in awhile you need to just be alone. Especially when someone (cough cough) Kiera is always breathing down your back about if you eaten lunch, or dinner or breakfast. If you really wanna piss me off, then that's the question to ask. Like last Friday, I had to be at her church by 8pm to leave for the lock-in. Well, my parents came home as usual late and I didn't have anything to fix for dinnner, so I grabbed a protein bar and left. Well, she offered me some fries, ok everyone knows that I always try to eat low carb. And just because I didn't want that she's all like, "Ashley you anger me." Seriously, what does it matter if I eat or not and then she argued with Katrina at the Lock-in for like an hour because Katrina didn't want to eat. I understand that, sometimes it's best to leave people alone. Then on Saturday, she asked me if I'd eaten all day, does it matter, that just makes me so mad. I know I've done somethings in the past, but after a year or so you'd think she'd leave me alone, it's not like I'm freaking anorexic, I mean I wish, lol jk. But she always does that, so thank god it's almost summer and I can have some peace, at least Ritika understands and knows that everything is ok, I just wish some people would shut up and stop breathing down my back about things, it's not a big effing deal!

But I can't  because I have that issue once someone calls and wakes me up at 9:45am I can't go back to sleep...that and my back is killing me. Now I get to spend the day with the family, yay! :::gag me:::  At least I'm exempt from all my finals, except chemistry, which I don't have to take until 2pm on Thursday...   At night I pray  That soon your face  Will fade away

I sware I can never be perfect for this woman, god nothing is ever good enough for her...I do so much and I try so hard, but it's never any good. Now, after ALL that shit I went through last summer, she wants to start it all over again...I'm sorry I don't look perfect, I'm sorry for not looking like a fucking size 2 barbie doll. I'm just so sick of all of this, I want to go away...

      Ahhh I need to go to bed...I've been looking for plane tickets for the past hour and a half. United seems to be the cheapest, $330-$292 (which after taxes and fees it comes out to $326.38) so whats like $4 dollars? Or I could fly to Omaha which is a little cheaper, but I don't know, have to ask the rents. They seem ok with me going by myself I think, I just don't know about the whole where I would stay part. But I'm definetly coming June 30th and staying until July 7th or 8th.   I talk to you but its not the same as touchin' you And every time you whisper my name, I wanna run to you We'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long But it feels like forever, and its hard to be strong  Baby 'cause I'm missing you now And its drivin' me crazy How I'm needin' you baby I'm missing you now Can't wait till I'm alone with you To show you how I'm missing you now  Wishin' you were here by my side is all that I can do Got my arms around my pillow at night, they should be holdin' you Thought I was stronger, how could I know, how could I know I can't take this much longer, its so hard on my soul  Baby I just can't wait, till I see your face Chase away this loneliness inside When you're close to my heart, right here in my arms Then and only then, will I be satisfied I'm missing you now We'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long But it feels like forever, and its hard to be strong

      This week was so perfect and it went by far too fast...I loved every moment. From going to the mall and the movies. To staying up late at night...taking a shower...;)Though it seems to get harder each time to say goodbye. I seriously have not stopped crying since he left. I stopped for a bit, until I came home and smelled my Gir doll :( But at least my parents are going to let me go up there for a week or so by any means possible. So that's always nice to think about. And they said he could stay with us anytime, at Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc. I'm glad they like him so much, I knew they would, what's not to like? :) Right before he left I gave him my class ring to show him how much he means to me. The sentimental value it worth so much more...Well I wish I could just type out everything detail, but right now I'm just sad and tired. I'll post more later. I love my Davey :)   And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby

      Yeah...so I finally fixed my computer...  So, prom was last night...eh I should of gone, I mean it'd beat sitting at home watching  Girl with a Pearl Earring . Not to mention the 20 people that asked me why I wasn't at prom. I had my reasons for not going, too much hassle, come on, $45-50 for a ticket, have to get your nails done, toenails, eyeborws waxed, hair done, makeup, etc. And it wouldn't of been worth it to me. Plus, I think it's best just to go to your senior prom, that is the one that really matters anyways. I still should of went...  So I'm a manager for the North Stars, yeah I had tryouts, didn't make the team, but my hard work did not go unnoticed for once.

      I give up on everything, I study my butt off for 2 freaking weeks for that stupid ACT test and it didn't even make a difference. I didn't even make a high enough score to be considered for my scholarship. And now I'm going to have to take it again on September 25th, like it's going to make a difference. I'm still stupid and suck at the thing. I'm sure Kiera could make a better score. I was counting on a high score, so I could get at least 66-100% of that scholarship and now I didn't even qualify it. How am I going to go to college now? They should seriously get rid of standardized testing, it's complete bullshit.

      I got all my information for this actor conservatory in the mail today. You know, I'm actually really considering it. Though, it's not an actual college degree, since it's a 2 year program. But it'd be great for maybe after college. And it's located right in Dallas! Basically, you live and breathe acting. Not so much theatre, because it's "Career Acting" but you take a bunch of technique classes involving voice and movement. And then a bunch of history on acting. So that's definitely a possibility for me.   I also got my information stuff for camp...I'm not allowed to bring my cell :( What am I going to do for 3 days without it?   Looks like I have a pretty busy summer. Going to Nebraska next week, then the week I get back I'm going on that tour of KD Studios. Then it's off to Tennessee the following Monday and stay a week there. Then after that I have to go to North Star Camp from July 25-28. And then I have to get senior pictures. After that, summer drill starts August 2-6. Then a bunch of back to school stuff for the North Stars. And finally school starts August 17th. Hopefully my David will be able to visit one week in August :)   Don't stop the love for anything I'll do everything I am into you

      Boring day, only 7...6 more days to go! I seriously gotta do some more tanning. Though, my mom did say that this is the darkest she's ever seen me, so I'm not ALL white, yay!   Waiting sucks ass. I'm so sick of waiting, I want to go now, I want to see my Davey so much. At least by this time next week I'll be there. And then I can just lay in his arms, while he innocently kisses me... :) I love him so much, I can't wait until we're in college together and we can spend all our time with each other...And then after college, we can get a basset hound puppy together! :)   And when the stars are shining brightly in the velvet sky,  I'll make a wish to send it to heaven

      I really should be at practice right now, but to tell you the truth I'm still shaky about driving. But see I was going to go, I decided to tan like around 11:30~12:15 so I could actually have enough time and be ready by 1:15 so I'd get there at 1:30. Sometime around 12:30, while watching 2 Fast 2 Furious (wut wut) Katie, a girl from dance texts me and asks if I can pick her up for practice. Well that's when I decided yeah I don't want to go. So I lied and I said I had to go to physical therapy. And now I feel bad for that. In a way I really didn't want to pick her up, even though she lives right by the high school. I forgot where she lived and that whole subdivison is one big maze. Which is why I feel bad now. I'm sure if she hadn't wanted me to pick her up, I'd be at practice right now. I was just scared about going out of my way. But the good thing is, since it's fixing to storm, I would of have to left Jenny outside in the storm, so at least that's a good positive for staying her. And my back has been bothering me since last night, so I rather just lounge in bed or take a hot bath then going to practice. And there is always next Monday, so missing one won't be so bad. And I did go last Monday, but no one told me there wasn't practice, so there =P  Only 8 more days and I get to be with my Davey! :) I'm so excited! It's going to be so great, being together...We'll make it!   Go to bed Dream of you That’s what I’m doing these days

      It just makes me upset, when my best friend has no self esteem for herself and just does anything with any guy. I mean does she have no morals? Does she not care about herself? I could understand maybe once or twice. But, after like what 10 times? Making the same mistake over and over again...it's insane. And I have to sit back and watch it all. I can't say anything, because I don't want to lose my best friend and also, would it really do any good? She's almost 18, if she hasn't learned it all by now, she never will. It makes me mad, she keeps making the same mistake over again and then she gets caughts and has to face punishment from her parents. She lied to be about what she did in April, and then tonight she did it on 3 different occasions. And it was REALLY REALLY sick, like never in my wildest dreams would I ever EVER try anything like that...And then that brings me to discuss Christianity. People wanna know why I'm not like so into it. Maybe because the majority I know are ALL hypocrites. Don't get me wrong, I'm a Christian and I know really sweet ones. But people like Kiera piss me off. "Oh I'm so good, I go to church everyday and I read the bible. And on my spare time I give cock to random guys! But Jesus still loves me" Seriously, WTF is wrong with these people? Do they feel the need to rebel because there parents have sheltered them with religion? My parents never forced me to go to church and they also gave me a more spiritual upbringing then religious and I turned out ok...Ahhh sometimes people just amaze me...   When you came my way You brightened every day With your sweet smile

      I just woke up at 1pm, ugh...Well if I could of actually gone to sleep last night. But no...I had to toss and turn ALL night because my back is gay and wouldn't stop hurting. So I got a total of about 1-2 hours of sleep. In which at 7am I just took some vicodin and the pain ceased somewhat leaving me knocked out til' 1. At least I go to the orthopedic surgeon tomorrow, maybe he can hit me up with something better that actually takes away ALL the pain and doesn't knock me out :/   She lives a life she didn't choose And it hurts like brand-new shoes

I think when I turn 18 I'm going to do something cool, like either get my belly button pierced or my tongue...hmmm  Today was fun, after tanning and taking the ACT test, I hung out with my girls, Em and Danielle. It actually felt normal, for once I could just take my mind off everything and have fun. I bought a really cute outfit and then after the mall we went to Em's to watch movies. Thirteen was ok, but we should of watched Eurotrip first, funnier and more naked guys! yeah! =p Wow, I'm hyped up...and there's no one here to talk to :( Oh wells.

      Woo! I just saw Jimmy Fallon on the Tony Awards...ahhh he's hot.   Anyways, today was fun. Went to Kayla's party at the Allen Natatorium. I think once the kids go to Italy I'm going to start lap swimming there. It's only $3 and it's open every day from 1-6pm and on Mondays and Wednesdays I can go from 8-9pm. So that should be fun. I love SWIMMING! :)  Well I have my ACTs bright and early next Saturday, going to need to study for that. I just want it to be over with. I'm nervous of course, but at least if I don't get the 28-30 I want, then I can just re-take it in September. But I'm crossing my fingers I only have to take it this once.    Maybe it's intuition  But some things you just don't question Like in your eyes I see my future in an instant

      Ok, so this wasn't the best week ever. But after today, things seem to be looking brighter. I know my back still hurts and I have an MRI and therapy to go to, but I'm going to be optimistic and hope for the best.   The fact I have the most wonderful guy in the world who cares for me and is always there for me when I need him makes me want to fight and be myself again. I can't stay depressed about what happened. What happened is over and now it is time to go on with life and be surrounded by those who love me and want to help me in any way they can. It feels so good to feel this way again. And I owe it all to seeing my Davey's picture and hearing his voice :) I love you sweetie! I am the happiest girl in the world because I have you!    You're the center of adrenaline And I'm beginning to understand You could be the best thing about me

      I got asked what's wrong and I had to reply nothing because everything is wrong and for some reason everything is hard to talk about. But, I guess the only way to get it out is to say everythinh here.  First, my life was changed a week ago and I can't go back to what was "normal". I can't go throughout a day without thinking about the whole accident, reliving every detail. I hate people talking about it, I hate all the pictures. I just wish it'd all go away and I could forget it ever happened. Now, I live in this fear of something bad happening again. I'm afraid to drive, I'm afraid to sleep, I'm afraid to die. And I know that was a freak accident, and the chances of that ever happening again is very slim. I miss my life before the accident, I miss my car, I miss my life free of pain and worry. I try to be strong, for everyone, I want to be stong, but it's hard.  Now, I'm worried about my back, I have this never-ending pain, that I'm scared will never go away. Every time I move, I can feel this pressure and it scares me. I want everything to be alright, I want all this to go away. I WANT MY LIFE BACK! No amount of money or whatever I get from the accident, will make this go away. I can't even sleep anymore and if I do get to sleep its light and I end up waking up about 3 times during the night anyways.   I want to feel stress free, pain free. I want to forget all that has happened and gone on with life. I feel the only way I'd feel safe, is if I was laying in David's arms and then I could forget everything else and just be happy. But, for now, that's not going to happen. I'm just going to have to deal with this by myself as best as I can. I'm scared and alone...

       Woo got back from camp yesterday. Actually though I was dreading camp, it turned out to be pretty fun. It probably would of been better if I wasn't sick. But hey, I made it 3 nights away from home! I realized something at camp, I realized how much I wanted to dance. And though I really do like being manager I just want to be out there with the girls dancing. And since this is my senior year I won't get a chance.&nbsp; I have way too many extra-cirricular stuff going on, so I can't take classes outside of school. And the way my schedule SHOULD BE (MNHS will mess it up) I won't be able to take a dance class. If we had 8 classes, I could. I might get out of anatomy and physicology and take one, but if not, I'm out of luck. But I really want to dance on a team, it looks challenging and I want that. I want to be out on the field, or on a stage, or gym floor, dancing. I want people to go wow that looks so great, etc. I know I'm in theatre, but I've sort of lost the flare for that. Because I know that this year no matter what, I'm going to get all the crappy parts so what's the use in trying? So I feel lost right now :(    &nbsp;  Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming   Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights   Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming

       Woo! I'm back from Tennessee. Not that it wasn't fun, well some parts were boring, but overall it was a decent trip. Now I get to get all ready for dance camp tomorrow...Yay...Part of me wants to go and the other is like I'd rather just stay at home. I know it'd be more fun if I was an actual dancer so I know what to expect. Being a manager, I assume I'll just be hanging out with Mrs. Gibson, but I don't know. Plus, what really sucks is we're not allowed to bring our cell phones. But I'm going to bring mine, I won't be able to talk, but maybe I can text once we get back to the room.     &nbsp;  Ugh, I feel like I have a cold. My throat is all sore and itchy and my nose is all stuffy. Hopefully it's just from the change of climates and it'll be all better tomorrow.     I lie awake   Drive myself crazy   Thinking of you

       So yeah, today was fun. We to see a play at 9am, which was really good. And then me, Em, Danielle, and Danielle's friend, Nikki went to the mall. Oh and Embry does&nbsp;agree with me about the whole guys looking at porn thing. At least someone does, Kiera and Ritika don't understand and finally someone does, because she feels the exact same way.     &nbsp;   While at the mall, Embry and me tried on prom dresses, this is the one I want:  urlLink click it ,  &nbsp;Even tho it's totally dominatrix like, it's so awesome looking on me!   &nbsp;   It’s been one week since you looked at me    Dropped your arms to your sides and said I’m sorry    Five days since I laughed at you and said    You just did just what I thought you were gonna do

Reading it again made me smile so much...so I just have to post it :) (I had to cut some stuff because it was really really long.)  D Phrygian: me too... you know, back in June, I honestly didn't think it would ever work ashsnl2005: thats not cool D Phrygian: but I wanted to give it a try, and besides, I didn't want to hurt you by saying so ashsnl2005: i never doubted it D Phrygian: I don't mean us, but the logistics of it D Phrygian: I didn't know if we'd ever meet, you know ashsnl2005: yeah... ashsnl2005: i know ashsnl2005: i thought about that too ashsnl2005: but we were determined D Phrygian: but I really wanted it to work, yeah D Phrygian: and then I was so worried about you calling me, lol ashsnl2005: i remember being so nervous asking you in june if you liked me D Phrygian: because Kyle didn't know about us for the longest time, cuz I thought he'd make fun of us ashsnl2005: awww D Phrygian: awwww ashsnl2005: lol D Phrygian: I'm so glad you asked ashsnl2005: yeah, well i didnt know, and you didnt seem like the type that would just blurt out and say something D Phrygian: I guess I knew you had a bit of a crush on me, but I don't know if I'd have ever said anything D Phrygian: yeah ashsnl2005: lol i can go look D Phrygian: lol, all right ashsnl2005: jk thats way too many convos D Phrygian: lol ashsnl2005: like idk how many D Phrygian: I remember our first few phone calls, too, those were cute...

D Phrygian: because I'd never really talked openly about sex to anyone, especially not to a girl I liked ashsnl2005: i thought they were great ashsnl2005: yeah well id never done that either D Phrygian: I think I was always afraid I'd be too graphic or something and turn you off, lol ashsnl2005: i might seem like i know alot, but im not that experienced, well i am now ;-) D Phrygian: hehe, we discover everything together ashsnl2005: hehe yay! D Phrygian: and then I remember for a while after I came back to college, I didn't talk to you much because Kyle was always around ashsnl2005: yeah... D Phrygian: and then I finally got over my phonophobia and called you more D Phrygian: I think it was over Thanksgiving break that I first talked to you like every night for a week D Phrygian: that was fun =) ashsnl2005: yeah it was great D Phrygian: I remember freaking out when I had to actually make our Christmas plans a reality because it meant telling my parents ashsnl2005: yeah i remember that D Phrygian: I was so scared about that, which is kinda silly in retrospect, since they were totally cool about you ashsnl2005: aww yay! D Phrygian: I remember arriving at Christmas...I was getting so nervous on the bus that I was starting to shake... ashsnl2005: really? ashsnl2005: awww D Phrygian: and then I stepped out and saw your car D Phrygian: and I went inside D Phrygian: you had your head down and didn't see me at first I guess ashsnl2005: yeah i was like nervous ashsnl2005: and i have issues when i get nervos ashsnl2005: lol D Phrygian: and then you stood up and you looked so much more beautiful than I'd guessed from your pictures, and I got all nervous again and just hugged you when I really wanted to give you a big kiss D Phrygian: it took me a while to open up, lol ashsnl2005: awwww, i was so nervous bc i didnt know if i was good enough and stuff, that freaked me out the most, and all i wanted to do that first day was just lay on you...but i was too nervous to make any move D Phrygian: I wanted to touch you so much those first days, you were so beautiful and curvy and nice, but I was just so nervous that I'd go too far or something D Phrygian: remember Kiera putting my arm around you? lol... ashsnl2005: haha yeah ashsnl2005: gotta love kiera D Phrygian: I was so afraid to touch you, it seems silly now D Phrygian: but I wanted to kiss you so bad that whole time ashsnl2005: i was too, i didnt know if you wanted me to or what and i didnt wont to make the first move, i figured that was your job D Phrygian: and then finally after two days we just went at it, hehe ashsnl2005: hehe ashsnl2005: news years at midnight D Phrygian: oh yeah... =) ashsnl2005: and we didnt stop till you left D Phrygian: that was my first kiss D Phrygian: it might've been obvious, lol ashsnl2005: well it was nice ashsnl2005: that was pretty much mine too ashsnl2005: like a real kiss D Phrygian: I'll always remember that night...in bed, making out, with Titanic on ashsnl2005: hehe yeha D Phrygian: it was magical ashsnl2005: that was so great ashsnl2005: i just wanted to take off my cherry pjs and shirt and get on you with my bra and "D" panties on D Phrygian: aww, I know, and I was still nervous about being too forward so I wouldn't take them off for you D Phrygian: you'll have to wear your D panties in May, hehe D Phrygian: only this time I'll get to see them more D Phrygian: and take them off ;-) ashsnl2005: hehe ok!

Saw Weston, a guy I used to swim with at MHS, but no he's doing theatre...WEIRD...lol like anyone actually tried on the swim team. Lol, I saw my old coach, Coach Files on Saturday with Embry, it was weird we were actually talking. I guess she just misses me on the team since I was one of the best swimmers...COUGH COUGH. JK! After starbucks, Kiera wanted to go to Sonic to meet up with Bryan, who I haven't seen since November of my sophomore year. But he was with his BITCHY gf, ahh I cannot stand Rachel Crowley, lol when they left Kiera and me, along with his friends were talking about her, it's mean but come on she does that bitch thing on purpose. And I had to have class with her for like 3 years in a row! It was HORRIBLE! But yeah, saw alot of old friends tonight, pretty cool I guess. Rented Along Came Polly and Calender Girls, so I'll watch that tomorrow.   And with a tear in my eye Give me the sweetest goodbye

      Woo look what I found! My Tribute to a World Leader paper from my freshman year in AP World Geography. Ahh this was such a good paper :)                        President Bill Clinton             What comes to mind when you hear the name Bill Clinton? Usually the 1998 scandal involving Monica Lewinsky. But out of that one downfall, he has had many achievements during the 8 years of his presidency.                  William Jefferson Clinton was born on August 19,1946, in Hope, Arkansas. He was an excellent student as well as an excellent saxophone player, and once considered being a professional musician. But that all changed once he met President John F. Kennedy and decided to enter a life of public service. Clinton graduated from Georgetown University, and in 1968 won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University. He then received his law degree in 1973 from Yale University, and entered politics in Arkansas. In 1976, Clinton was elected Arkansas Attorney General, and then won the governor’s race in 1978. After losing the election for a second term, he then regained the office 4 years later, and served until he defeated George Bush and Ross Perot in the 1992 presidential election.                      During Clinton’s first year in office, he focused on passing legislation that improves health care and family life. Another legislation is passed that reduces the deficit and increases handgun safety. Plus, in 1993, the NAFTA trade agreement is passed which allows freer trade between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. Clinton did all these remarkable things in just his first year of office.                       In 1994, the Clinton administration passes a Crime Bill that adds100,000 new community police officers to the streets, bans assault weapons, and the administration created a Violence Against Women Act, which is the first federal effort to address domestic violence issues.                        Then in 1995, a major Bosnian peace settlement was worked out in Dayton, Ohio, which brought to end the largest campaign of force in the history of NATO’s existence. After re-election in 1996, President Clinton focused on raising the minimum wage and setting up welfare reform. The administration also passed a Telecommunications Reform bill to improve competition in the industry and enable parents to monitor programs with violent content. Plus, the Safe Drinking Water Act is created to ensure that communities can purify their drinking water.                   In 1997, the Clinton administration signed the Balanced Act, which eliminates the $290 billion budget deficit by 2002. Also in 1997, legislation is passed to provide additional children’s education and health care funds, and for the first time in 35 years, a president sighs a bill that modernizes the Food and Drug Administration process.                 Then in 1998, for the first time since 1969, the federal government has a budget surplus. President Clinton supported using the surplus to “Save Social Security first.” Also, President Clinton played the major role in the Good Friday Peace Accords between Catholic and Protestant leaders in Northern Ireland and he also played another important role in the Wye River Memorandum between Benjamin Netaryahu and Yassir Arafat.              In 1999, President Clinton hosted a Middle East summit for the continued work on the Middle East peace process. Another legislative is also passed that increases modernization in the banking industry, which replaced the law that, had been in effect   since the Great Depression. Also, the Work Incentives bill was passed, which was one of the most important legislative advances for people with disabilities.                 In 2000, the final year of President Clinton’s presidency, he worked to pass the Senior Citizen’s Freedom to Work Act, which ensured that senior’s can continue to earn revenue passed the normal retirement age. Plus, the administration realized a major trade goal by working to have China accepted into the World Trade Organization, which enabled American goods to be sold on the Chinese markets.                   These just included summaries of each of the years that Clinton was in office. Look how much he and his administration accomplished; a lot. I believe he was one of the best presidents the United States has ever had. The only reason the scandals such as: Paula Jones, White Water, and Monica Lewinsky ever got out on Clinton was due to other people’s political agenda. Also during Clinton’s presidency, Rush Limbaugh made his radio talk show popular by putting Clinton down, which later, other copy cats followed. But it didn’t work up to their advantage. Since he didn’t get impeached and served out his term. But when you have a president that has not only accomplished many things in his own country, as well as internationally. People are going to get upset because President Clinton is doing so well; he is doing better than others. That is why when he left office in 2000, he had an approval rating of 65%.  Next time when you might judge Former President Bill Clinton, remember all the good he accomplished in his presidency, and what he did for our country. Now, look who’s president and see how we are in a recession and at war. At this time ask yourself who was the better president?                  In conclusion, during the administration of William Jefferson Clinton, the U.S. enjoyed more peace and economic well being that at any other time in history. He was the first democratic president to serve a second term since Franklin D. Roosevelt. During his terms in office, the U.S. had the lowest unemployment rate in modern times, the highest home ownership in the country’s history, dropping crime rates in many places, and reduced welfare. He proposed the first balanced budget in decades and also achieved a budget surplus. Finally, as a plan to celebrate the millennium in 2000, Clinton called for a great national motivation to end racial discrimination. This is why I believe Bill Clinton is a true world leader.

      One highlight of my day:  ::at Wendy's:: Ritika: "Kiera, if you keep talking to Joe I'm going to slash your tires." Me: "Well, I'm going to slash my wrists." ::Dirty look from Kiera:: I love pissing her off like that! She gets so mad when I say that =p  Second highlight of my day:  ::calling BJ:: BJ: "Hello?" Me: "Yeah, um BJ did you happen to tell Kiera to read my blog?" BJ: "Ummm what are you talking about?" Me: "Don't fucking bullshit me, you told her to read it!" BJ: "Ahh, now I remember." Me: "That is private and you had no right to tell her. I was going to handle that today, and you fucked it all up. NEVER FUCKING TALK TO ME AGAIN!" ::click::  Ritika: "Damn that was mean, you shouldn't of called him when you were so pissed off."  Me: "Ahhh...well I feel better now!"  I know, I can be a bitch...ehhh only when people piss me off or are just stupid.

      That's it, I'm going to rant on my blog. Let's see, I've been lied to and betrayed. That's just freaking peachy. You know, I have all the evidence that proves Joe is just using Kiera. Too bad my log mananger didn't save the convo, but I'm sure Kiera would believe her best friend. First off, this asshole IMs me and demands that I call Kiera and tell her to get online. I'm like WTF? Dude you don't even know me. So I'm like umm no, if you want to talk to Kiera you can call her. "oh I don't have any minutes." Well sucks for you then buddy. I then ask the obvious question, "do you like Kiera?". "yea". "So then why don't you go out with her?" "oh I don't do long distance relationships." He fucking goes to UT in ARLINGTON! What, isn't that like a 45 minute drive at most and his family does live in McKinney, so it's not like he won't be back. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't want Kiera to go out with him under any circumstances, but his justification for not wanting to go out with her, SUCKS. If you want to try a long distance relationship, try 600 miles, mmmk?   Anyways, I finally just go off, saying he's using Kiera and he's all like that's your opinion. Yes mine and everyone else's. He knows Kiera is weak, that she has bad self esteem. But she's too blind to realize this and he knows it. He drops her after Winter Ball and then all of a sudden they're at it again? I told him that she really likes him and that all he wants his to get some and that he probably has like 10 other girls. He goes "yea and she can go with any guy too." HELLO? She likes you, she doesn't want anyone else. He basically just told on himself there, yeah he's TOTALLY not using her...It's really sad when you have 3 people simutaneously yelling at him and he blocks all of us, yeah really mature. So that's all the proof you need there for that.   Now, let's get to tonight. Kiera asks if I've talked to Joe. I told her he IMed me yesterday wanting to talk to her. But I didn't say I went off on him. And I asked her if she had talked to him today. "No" she said, "he hasn't been online, he has on his cell, but I don't want to bother him during class." I'm sure this fool doesn't have class at 8pm especially during a summer session. But, here's the cherry topper! She told Allison during this same time period, that she did talk to Joe and in fact that they are "going out". See, what exactly did I miss here? She had just told me that she knows no one likes Joe, esp me and that I was looking out for her. I was thinking that I was finally getting through. But nooooo. She goes behind my back.   Kiera has a bad rep, since she did all that stuff with Brian (BJ) and Josh last summer, it's gotten around school. And Em's ex, Chris is good friends with Joe, who informed Joe of Kiera by Embry in which he knew to call her for a good time. I'd rather be a nobody then be known as a slut. She asked me the other day why guys always ask her to do things...umm DUH...yeah. Why can't she just find a nice guy? It's not that hard. All the guys she lkes are the ones that are total players and just want to use her. If she just acted normal she would find the right guy.   Tomorrow, I'm going to give her an ultimatum, either drop Joe and change or I'm not going to be there for you when you need me. I know what's going to happen, she's going to get her heart-broken or end up in some serious shit and I'm won't be there. I told her so and if she won't listen to what I have to say then she's on her own. Hopefully mine and Ritika's talk tomorrow will change all this. I want the old Kiera back, the one who is fun to hang out with and is not on the phone or net with guys all night. I can only hope and pray we get through to her tomorrow, for her own good. I don't want to see her hurt.    you've come so far since that time when you let your first boy in and you do it so carelessly as if you had no self esteem a victim of apathy but you don't care what people say about you i will let you in before you break yourself

      So I've just spent about 30 minutes educating myself on ALL the special trigger spots for guys...Hehe, August will definitely be fun now. Too bad I have to wait to try out the 10 Kuma Sutra moves I learned. Ah oh well =p  Yay, I probably get to have surgery on my back. Mainly, to prevent my disc from actually becoming "Ruptured". Right now, it's a "contained herination". And he thinks that relieving the pressure from my disc will reduce the risk of me making my back worse in the years to come. So yeah, I go back in about 7 weeks and we'll decide from there. It's only a 45 minute out patient procedure, I'll do it. Though, there are minor complications that can be associated with the surgery, but they're slim. And I'd rather do this now, then wait like 10 years and really injure my back. Thoughj, I'll always have back problems the rest of my life. Sucks don't it?    And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be Than here in my room dreaming about you and me

      Ugh...I need to go to bed. But I don't want to, because once I lay down in the dark I'll realize my Davey isn't here. And I'm really not ready to face that. Seriously, so far I've unpacked and cleaned out like half of my closet, going through clothes and getting rid of just some old things. But now, I'm kind of tired and I know I can't win this fight. So I'm going to face the fact that we're not together. But, I do have Kiera tonight so that's worth something :)   And another night begins But I know how this one ends

      :::eyebrows down, lip sticking out::: "Meh meh meh meh" :( I miss that face so much...This past week just went by extremely fast. Everything was so perfect. I could of just laid in his arms and never of left. I seriously could not stop crying, I hate saying goodbye. I know we only have to wait 5 weeks to see each other again, but still...it's 35 days without seeing his sweet smile everyday or having his arms around me. I'm going to miss laying beside him at night, waking up in the middle of the night, seeing his cute face, knowing how much he cares for me. I know I can spend the rest of my life like this. People can say I'm too young to know what love is, or too naive. But, I've never been so sure about anything before in my entire life. I know my love is true and I know it's going to last a lifetime. So even though it might be goodbye for now, I can see in the distance future a time when we'll always be together.   What's meant to be will always find away She's going to marry that boy someday

       Finally, I got my new schedule. It's all good. Though I wanted to stay in Infinity with Mr. Cole, because he was so excited about having me, Embry and Kiera in his math class again. So I feel bad for that, but I'll make sure to stop by and chill with him. If only it satisfied my math credits for college, but no, so I'm stuck in Algebra 3, because I'm too much of a pussy to take Pre-Ap Pre-Cal. And from what I heard from Ritika, my Algebra 3 teacher sucks. At least I only have it every other day and plus I'm a teachers pet, so maybe it won't be so bad =p  Schedule 04-05 1- NorthStars 2- Economics CP (1st semester)/ U.S. Government (2nd semester) 3- English 4 AP 4- Algebra 3 5- Physics 1 6- NorthStars 7- Economics CP (1st semester)/ U.S. Government (2nd semester) 8- Varsity Theatre 9- Anatomy/Physicology 10- Physics 1

       OMG I had the most freakest dream, this  beats them all. It's one of those dreams you think about for awhile, because you just wonder why? Anyways, whenever my parents came home, sometime after 7, I went to sleep. Well, I dreamed, for I don't know what reason that I was pregnant, I don't exactly know where I was ( it seemed like a really weird plant store, that had a weird old guy). And all of a sudden my water broke and I call for my mom and out of no where she pops up. Then she tells me to get in the bath, I was like WTF? But I did, and once I stood up my ear stopped up (really weird) and just as I was about to get into the water, my mom comes up and says heres your baby its a girl! At this point I've just lost what all happened. Anyways, I was like mom I need to go to the hospital, and she wouldn't let me, I just wondered around in my dream for awhile and I started feeling really weird and kind of hurting too. Lol then I woke up around 9 and had to pee really bad.  Haha that was soooo messed up.      So this week has turned out alot better, only 2 more days of practice! Yay! And then the kids are coming back on Saturday. Which on Saturday I'm hanging out with Em and Danielle and we're going to go see her bf's play and then make our shirts for 6 flags! And almost 9 days til I see my Davey! :)    You only can rescue me   This is my prayer

       Last night I got out alot of my anxieties, which made me feel a whole lot better. It's just that somethings were said, that I know weren't meant, they just came out the wrong way. I just want to forget about it. I finally got rid of the whole convo entirely, so I wouldn't be tempted to keep looking at it over and over again. Regardless, it was said, and it felt as though the words went right through me. I probably shouldn't dwell on it and get over it, but right now I can't. But I want to so much. It'd be easier to get over it if I didn't have to see the words, "I'm sorry", but rather feel it. Feel that warmth and love that surrounds me in his arms and then all this would melt away...      But I promise that this won't last for long, all this will soon be over and we can just check it as another bump in the road and August 14th will be here and nothing else will seem to matter :)
