      so a rollercoaster of a ride for you, as i look back on the past few years of my life in a nutshell. so i went to art school, ECIAD to be exact, for four years in vancouver, took a year of web designing and then drove across the country in this old 1980 lincoln towncar with my dog and my boyfriend. stopped over in winnipeg to hang out with some family then made it to my hometown and stayed for a month to chill out then off to new york we went. lived in the bronx and worked at the aich in manhattan for about 8 months and accidentaly got pregnant. then moved back home to have the baby, we are renting a house, living, working, and hustling day to day. taking care of my family, we have a beautiful baby boy and we are surrounded by my friends and family. i can't complain too much besides being too god damn busy to do any of my creative shit that i am (or use to be all about). it only comes out in my job. which is a graphic designer for the curriculum center of a mohawk emersion elemenatary school on my reserve, which i am very proud of because we are constantly creating new material in our language to teach our children. i am waiting for my contract to be over so that my family and i can maybe continue traveling.

      so if anyone has heard of gmail before, i have the privelage of owning an account  urlLink sondrac@gmail.com  email me if you want an invite, but anyway you can only be invited to gmail before it becomes public. they have this thing called gmail swap where people swap things for an invite like their services or free webhosting or a large array of silly things. so this guy was offering his graphic design abbilities to create a logo of whatever we wanted, i thought "ahh, i'll give a try just for the fun of it." plus i wanted to see what they came up with, thinking it was going to be half decent this is what i wasted one of my invites for.

      Rubi Day Uno, my red Doberman gave birth to 7 mutt puppies on May 13th starting at 10 pm. We suspected that she was only due for another week or so but sure enough she was ready. I was home alone at the time, terrified to witness it solo. This was my first time ever having puppies i had no idea what to do and what to expect.  We were both asleep on the couch when she got up all of a sudden and jumped on me in complete terror, i sat right up as she paced in circles then stopped in the middle of the living room with half a puppy sticking out of her XXXX. So i immediately put her in her cage, where she was to have them. The 1stt puppy came and it took a while for the 2nd one to come but in the meantime she was in complete discomfort moving around in her cage, stepping on the first puppy, growling at it when it tried to feed and she even bit it in the eye. I let her out to give her a break and she had the second one right on our/her futon. It was a nasty mess to clean up, i immediately put her and her puppy back in her cage. Soon the 3rd 4th and 5th came out up to 4 o'clock in the morning, as she just lied there in true exhaustion. It seemed as though things calmed down and we could both get some shut eye from all the excitement and exertion.  Trying to fall asleep to her growling all night wasn't easy but well appreciated once i was completely zonked out. When i woke up several hours later i counted the puppies and there was a 6th puppy.               The next day Rubi and her "bebee's",(as my son would say), were getting along just fine. She was slowly getting use to them and vice a versa. She was becoming a very grown up mommy. She did not even want to get up or get out of the cage all day, she was very protective of them. That afternoon i went outside to cut the grass and when i came back into the house it smelt like blood, i looked in the cage and there laid a 7th puppy. Rubi was licking it to death, trying to revive it over and over again. It was for sure born dead 24 hours after her water broke. Anyway i didn't know what to do, she would bark at me and would not let me near her or the puppy. Unlike the other ones, i was able to help her out a bit but this one was off limits. There was no way i was going to risk my hand at Rubi. So we left the house, i talked to my aunty and she suggested i get that puppy out of there a.s.a.p. and burry it far far away where Rubi would never be able to smell it, and possibly dig it up. So when i got back to the house she was still licking it and growling at me. I waited to get my courage together to try to grab the puppy just when she started to chew the stomach open where the embilico cord was connected. It was totally disgusting i didn't want to watch but i couldn't help it. She started to eat the whole thing, soon there was just the head hanging by the neck sticking out of her mouth, a arm and paw to the side and a little ball of fur. I was in complete shock my dog just ate her own baby, but it was probably better off that way to let nature take its course.           A few weeks later we had to move the puppies into the shed because they started to smell too much and they were getting very loud, crying all the time and demanding from Rubi constantly. A couple of weeks after that when they were big enough not to fit through a gated dog penn, we moved them outside into Rubi's penn. We had boards up just in case but a few of them still managed to make their way through the gate or they dug a hole under the cage to try to escape. Soon enough they were ready to go to their own new homes and we started to give them away one by one. We were worried we would have a hard time getting rid of them but once the first one was gone they were all taken within a week after that. I was sad to see them all gone because i was hoping we would get stuck with one. But it's better off that they get put into good homes, i hope. One dog is more than enough for us to handle.

      O.K. so i'm training for a half marathon and yesterday i was doing a 10k along the seaway where i spotted two deer, 1 male and 1 female. i was less then half a km away as they were crossing the street to get to the water so i stopped running, they didn't see me right away. honestly i was scared that the male would ram me if i kept running towards them so i waited till they spotted me and when they did they froze then i froze. it was a showdown. my dog didn't notice them right away she was just goofing around and tekaroniake was sleeping. after about five minutes they ran away  as ruby noticed them and charged after them (she didn't catch then of course) then i was able to run again.
