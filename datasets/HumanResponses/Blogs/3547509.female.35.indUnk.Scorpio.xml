      My misery is your reward.  I stopped smoking four days ago. I used to have 1-2 a day. Lately it's been about half a pack. So - time to stop.  And. Of course. I have quit a few times, and then started up again. But hopefully this time it will stick. This time I will make it stick.  It's been fucking hell.  I feel as if my mouth is filled with glass, and that my skin has been rubbed raw. I am fuzzy and unfocused. Nicotine withdrawal is a bitch.  And. Of course. I can't stop dreaming of ashtray slaves.  Kneeling little ashtray slaves, holding ashtrays in both hands, heads bowed, fetching my pack, lighting one without words. Blowing smoke into someone's face. Flicking ashes into the open mouth of a bootlicking slave.  And. Of course. I will miss having to leave the bar to have a smoke. Thank you for nothing, Mr. Bloomberg. But at least it was fun watching which guys volunteer to be my sidewalk ashtray (after making a stink about the law, and my disgust at flicking ashes onto the ground, and bitching about holding an ashtray and smoking at the same time...well... you would be surprised how many wimpy men jump at the chance to be of service).  They just love to help. Don't they?

      sub55 writes:   "I, of course, offer myself in all sorts of stunning ways whenever I am standing on line. Oh, you got it. Mr big and powerful tough guy all but gets on his knees for a woman in heels. May I hold the door, buy your coffee, retrieve whatever you are waiting for. I am helpless. Of course, what I really want is for the heeled beauty to command me to my knees and kiss the toe of her shoe. Why? If I knew that I'd be rich."   It seems like both sides of the whip enjoy these little moments, these little public displays of service...  One of my favorite moments. Years ago. Me working as a receptionist, on a night out with co-workers.  Food was served, but it was a bar, so table space was small and inconvenient. One of the senior guys in the office saw I kept on reaching awkwardly for my plate. He finally offered to hold it for me, in both hands. It was an extremely submissive posture. But I don't think others caught it.  Without saying a word, I casually made a show of slowly eating the food, waving the fork gently, while he was quiet and held the plate. For a few moments we locked eyes - and I knew hew was dying inside. Dying to let me know - something. Finally he looked down, like a defeated animal, in response to my stare. And I just lazily fed myself, as he bowed his head...  Did I ever do anthing about it? No. He was married, and, no matter what, it would turn out bad - work things generally do.

      My profile has only been on bondage.com for a little over an hour. And already my inbox is full.  The smart ones will visit this site, and recieve my full instructions.  First of all: be a good person. Impress in me that you are a decent human being first. Hard to care if you are a hot, willing submissive if you are a lying two-faced cheating fucking bastard.  Second: do not send a form letter. Or an e-mail that you sent to someone else already, with a one or two changes. Such bullshit.  Third: be brief, but thorough.  For those who have read this far, and desire more, write to me a long well-written introduction letter ending with the phrase:  Goddess Lacuna, i am Yours to command .

      Someone just e-mail me and asked me about my opinion of white vs. African-American male slaves. The basic question: do I get a special satisfaction from seeing a white boy cringing at my feet?  Yes.  I do not consider myself to be a racist, and despite our awful legacy I look to the future, and not to the past. I do not discriminate.  But do I like watching a white boy leashed and collared? Damn straight. Do I like putting them under the lash? Uh-huh.  Nothing more than dynamics. But watching a bootlicking white male collared slave being ground beneath my heel - does make me smile.

      I was in the gym today. There is a machine I have always wanted to try - it's a little on the weird side. It is aerobic, but also involves weights. Essentially you push footpads with weights adding resisitance, as fast or as slow as you want.  At first - I HATED it. These metal plates kept smacking together. It felt wrong. Awful.  A guy a little older than me saw my trouble, and came over to help.  Sometimes you just know.  I was pissed at being embarrassed, and had to decide quickly if I was to be nice - or be a bitch. And I felt like a bitch.  Plus. Something in his eyes told me to push it.  I felt cold and cruel as I allowed him to teach me the finer points of this machine. I was fucking frosty.  When I saw make a show of wiping his sweat from the machine I just got a tingle. When I got the hang of it, I just gave him a cold nod, and turned away.  I expected him to just slink away. But, instead, "Well, if I can be of service again...".  Little bootlicker.
