       I am sure eveyrone has noticed the lack of fondness I have for Mondays!! I hate them! They are always the start of something that I would rather be finished with! I am sure that everyone has those moments with mondays, but do you have them with every Monday?&nbsp; I do!! I can't stand it!!! I would rather it be over than just beggining!!!!!!!!   I had so much fun on saturday! I got to see Jordan! HEHEHE, I am such a big nerd when it comes to him!!! He makes me smile like a little school girl whenever I see him, and not because he is exceptionally hot, but because he is so nice and genuine in his reactions!! It is very rare to find people like that these days, ecspecially in the local music scene! But he has always been like that! Its great!!&nbsp; He was singing to me from stage and he even inserted my name into one of the songs!!! LOL! I am so not making that up! He told me himself! Said he saw me jammin at the Bar! LOL! What a nerd! Anyways, enough of the giddy excitedness! That was probably the high point of my weekend though, nothing could beat that!&nbsp; I am sorry! It just can't, for those of you who know me, you know why!!!!    Anyways, that is all I got right know! I am ready for the next Horses show! LOL!   Later!

      I found the following article on a sight, and I thought everyone should read it! It is very well done!!&nbsp; It is a great view point, I wish I could remember where I found it so I post who wrote it! Anyways, enjoy!  A Christian Speaks Of The Faith And Path Of Wicca  I  am a Christian and not a Wiccan. A Christian is one who has been baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and who has made a personal, free-will decision to commit himself and all his or her life to our Lord and God and Savior, Jesus Christ. Both of these things are true of me. I am a member of St. Mary's Eastern Orthodox Church, Calhan, Colorado. In this paper, I am not speaking as agent for any church, but I am, entirely on my own responsibility, speaking the truth in love, as we Christians are supposed to do. A Situation of Strife and Shame:There are many Christians today who believe that anyone who is not a Christian is doomed to an eternity of suffering in hell. Any decent person, believing this, would be compelled to try to save as many people from this fate as possible. But is this belief correct? Jesus Christ, having noted the faith and righteousness of a Roman centurion, a Pagan, proclaimed:"Assuredly I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel! And I say to you that many will come from east and west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the sons of the king- dom will be cast out into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." (Matthew 8:10-12)If we accept these words as true, and surely we should, then it is clear that heaven will contain many who are not Christians, and hell will contain many who are! Clearly, throughout the Gospels, Jesus Christ sets forth the criteria for entrance into the kingdom of heaven, and those criteria include love, kindness, forgiveness, and a refusal to judge others:"For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses." (Matthew 6:14-15)"For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the same measure you use, it will be measured back to you." (Matthew 7:2)"But go and learn what this means: `I desire mercy and not sacrifice.'" (Matthew 9:13)"Therefore be merciful, just as your Father also is merciful. Judge not, and you shall not be judged. Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be for- given." (Luke 6:36-38)Is it not clear? Anyone who fails in these things, will calling himself Christian save him? Anyone who obeys God in these things, will being unbaptized condemn him? Jesus said, "Not everyone who says to Me, `Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven." (Matthew 7:21)Yet it is not by good works that we earn our way into heaven, because there is no way we can earn the free gift of God's mercy and grace, which alone can save us. But it is clear that it is not by faith, in the sense of sharing the Christian faith, that we are saved, either. The faith which saves us is not faith in the goodness of our works, nor faith that we have the right theology and/or belong to the right church. Rather, it is faith in God, and in His mercy:"So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy." (Romans 9:16)But the Wiccans, you will say, do not have faith in God. Yet by their own theology, they certainly do. Those who call them Satan-worshippers are entirely wrong. They do not worship Satan, or even believe that Satan exists. Instead, they worship a Goddess and a God whom they understand as manifestations of a higher and unknown Deity.Now if you are a Christian, this will sound familiar to you, and it should. In the Bible we find the following:"Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, `Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious; for as I was passing through and con- sidering the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Therefore, the One whom you worship without knowing, Him I proclaim to you" (Acts 17:22-23)The Wiccans worship the Unknown God, as manifested to them in the form of a Goddess and a God. Therefore, our Bible tells us they worship the same God we do; and if they do not know this, we should know it!For those of us who are unable to simply stand on God's Word, and must prove to themselves the truth of what it proclaims the holy Apostle John has given us the method for doing this. You have only to attend any public Wiccan ceremony, and test the spirits which are there, to see "whether they are of God" (1 John 4:1). You will find that, while the power manifested there may be less than what you have experienced as a Christian, that power is clearly the power of God.Dear brothers and sisters in Christ, these people of Wicca have been terribly slandered by us. They have lost jobs, and homes, and places of business because we have assured others that they worship Satan, which they do not. We have persecuted them, and God will hold us accountable for this, you may be sure, for He has said, "Assuredly I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me." (Matthew 25:40)Let us, from this point onward, repent of our misdeeds and declare that henceforth we shall obey Christ our God, and not judge others or condemn them, so that He will not have to judge and condemn us for our sins.

        Gemini Sun Sign ProfileMay 21 - June 21 Gemini is the third Sign of the Zodiac, and those born under this Sign will be quick to tell you so. That's because they love to talk! It's not just idle chatter with these folks, either. The driving force behind a Gemini's conversation is their mind. The Gemini-born are intellectually inclined, forever probing people and places in search of information. The more information a Gemini collects, the better. Sharing that information later on with those they love is also a lot of fun, for Geminis are supremely interested in developing their relationships. Dalliances with these folks are always enjoyable, since Geminis are bright, quick-witted and the proverbial life of the party. Even though their intellectual minds can rationalize forever and a day, Geminis also have a surplus of imagination waiting to be tapped. Can a Gemini be boring? Never!Since Geminis are a mix of the yin and the yang, they are well represented by the Twins. The Gemini-born can easily see both sides of an issue, a wonderfully practical quality. Less practical is the fact that you're not sure which Twin will show up half the time. Geminis may not know who's showing up either, which can prompt others to consider them fickle and restless. They can be wishy-washy, too, changing their mood on a simple whim. It's this characteristic which readily suggests the Mutable Quality assigned to this Sign. Mutable folks are flexible and go with the flow. Further, the Twins are adaptable and dexterous and can tackle many things at once. It's a good thing, too, when you consider their myriad interests. The downside of such a curious mind, however, can be a lack of follow-through. How much can any one person do, anyway? Ruled as they are by the Planet Mercury, Geminis exhibit a delicious brand of mercurial energy. They are quick-thinking, quick-witted and fast on their feet, much like the messenger god of Roman mythology that rules their Sign. Geminis are both curious and clever, which is why they are such a hit at cocktail parties. Although they talk a great game, they also love to listen and learn. With any kind of luck, the Twins will find themselves in interesting company, because if they don't, they are likely to get bored and start fidgeting. Any social setting is a good one for a Gemini, however, since these folks are charming, congenial and love to share themselves with their friends. While their effusiveness may be misconstrued as scheming by some, Geminis generally have their hearts in the right place. It's that ample energy which can also paint them as scatterbrained and unfocused, but behind all that zipping around, the Twins are busily filing all that good data away.The Element associated with Gemini is Air. Air Signs are the thinking person's Sign, and the Twins don't disappoint. Those born under this Sign prize intellect and consider it the key to all things. At work, they are the clearest of thinkers, looking at a project from all (well, at least two) sides and putting forth some logical and well-thought-out ideas. This quality makes Geminis an asset to any team, and while these folks are not inclined to take the lead, they are a most valuable component. It's also the Gemini's literary bent which allows them to offer a useful perspective on most any situation. The Twins also enjoy bringing their objective reasoning and big-picture ability into their personal relationships. While some may perceive all this logical thought as cold and unemotional, it's simply how these folks tick. They want to connect, they just do it their own way. Luckily for Geminis (and their pals), their lightness of spirit and youthful exuberance help them to appear forever young. In keeping with that skip in their step, Geminis enjoy short road trips -- and their agile minds and nimble hands ensure that they could change a tire (if needed) in no time flat. Is all of this Twin-energy more than any one person can handle? Ah, maybe that's why they are twoWhen it comes to sports, Geminis would seem a natural for doubles tennis -- and they are. They love the camaraderie of games and play, which is why they excel at team events. Whether it's volleyball or a game of Charades, Geminis are always ready to play. A book club would certainly stimulate their literary minds. In the game of love, Geminis are playful, flirtatious and endless fun. Physically speaking, Gemini rules the nervous system, which is why Twins should practice yoga or deep breathing techniques. Layering themselves in soft yellows and blues will also calm their mood.The great strength of the Gemini-born is in their ability to communicate effectively and to think clearly. Adventures of the mind are what the Twins are all about. They also love to share themselves with their friends, and they make for charming companions. INTERESTING VERY INTERESTING........

      I wrote this poem a couple of weeks ago just in the spur of the moment! I wasn't thinking about writting a poem or anything, I was at work and it popped into my head, so I wrote it down and posted it in my Journal.&nbsp; It is not complete, something is missing.&nbsp; But For know it is what I have. Let me know what you think!!! I need feedback! Its called "A work in Progress" &nbsp;  He'll call to say I love you   He'll call to say he cares   He'll call to say I miss you and its more than I can bare...    &nbsp;  He doesn't really love you, or even really care   He doesn't really miss you and its more than you can bare....    &nbsp;  You say that you've forgotten, say that you don't care...   Your insides are all twisted from the pain that isn't there    &nbsp;  You aren't really crying, you wouldn't shed a tear....   Your heart it isn't aching from the pain that isn't there....    &nbsp;  You tell the world your fine, you never really cared    &nbsp;  But inside your still reeling from the pain that isn't there.......

       Here is my rant! Not directed at any one, just want to get it off my chest, and this seems to be a good fourm!!!   Someone has been stealing my DVD's!!  I think I am up to 8 missing!! And 2 of my faves in the world are gone!!!  Practical Magic and Everafter!!! DAMN PEOPLE!!!!  I don't know who would want to steal anything from any of us, that is just a really sorry thing to do to someone! And the thing is, those movies where there, and know they are not! I mean they were there after the last party, and know they are gone! So they went missing in the last month! That is just sucky!!  It hurts my feelings alot that someone would steal when they are invited into our home! Hurts even more that I am going to have to reinvest in movies, ecspecially since I really can't afford it! And I am going to have to move all of them out of the living room where they belong, into my bedroom, this also sucks for leeann, as she likes to watch them when she was home, and know they will not be easily accesible for her!     Ok, I will quit ranting know! I just wanted to say that this sucks! And hurts!   Love ya'll, thanks for reading my rant!   Angel
