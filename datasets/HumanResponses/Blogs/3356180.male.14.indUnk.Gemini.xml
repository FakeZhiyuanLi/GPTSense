      I thought 27 is a lousy result, since it did not reflect the amt of work I put in with KM. Thus, I thought I would be getting the lower range. However, this is not the case.   Many ppl got marks in the range of 24-26, and they are mostly under Mrs Choi. According to SYC, she is even stricter than the "famous" Teocm, my mentor. Imagine my surprise! SYC keeps insisting b4 that he will get higher marks than me, as Choi will be more lenient. Too bad.  Well, it's probably a excuse.  I'm sorry that some ppl had failed miserably for MRP. I wonder how are they going to survive the storm of CPK, which I think is the greatest tests. Well, they better work hard, otherwise they will continue to fail. There's no shortcut.  If u dun work hard, u definitely failed. If u work hard, there's a chance.....

      The sun shone with a roaring brilliance, illuminating the sky to gentle blue, pushing mother earth to greater life.   Ignorant of the clouds’ gathering conspiracy as they secretly plots against him as the sun linger on the throne.  Soon the rain began to beat as the sun’s unbeatable glow fades, and advances through her face. As the sun was losing ground.  Just as it seems they were fighting a losing battle and the end is near, nobody realise whose is it.  The sun shone once more with a glowing brilliance as the triumph was celebrated in the magnificent rainbow  As the sun condemn the gloomy darkness to eternal slumber

      I'm really looking forwards to the geography trip which promises so much, which is organized by Miss Cheong. Obviously I'm not going for IH ACE overflow as I'm going for the refreshing learning experiences.   We can have first-hand experience of agriculture and sleep with others. We will also be able to interact more closely, in a healthy manner. We will be knowing each other-close up and will have a great time together.  I just wish time would soar and slip through my hand like air over plane.   Countdown!   Note: I wonder how Wei Seng and co. Organize the trip. Notice they are all Ortus HClub members? Well, they also helped in the admin stuff.   Not only that, they are also in charge of the ws and other stuffs like that. I found out there's a leak, and somehow I know something. However, is there a leak when I don't even know what's the qns? It's pretty weird and then I cannot get anymore info from Yee Jiunn regarding these. Otherwise, there might be a real leak.  Then there's the rooming and grouping list. I'm sure Miss Cheong would leave these tasks to Wei Seng and co. Since she's so busy. Anything, I think Ortus Club member fixed these. Ok, this sound too extreme. Let's say, they decide. That's it's no wonder ppl are sleeping with their pal/companion. They are also more familiar with their classmate.  Anyway, I'm bunking with Yee Jiunn, whom I'm comfortable with. Just imagine, sleeping with TK. He probably (definitely) give reminders non-stop. Nah, better not. AS such, I feel sorry for sam and kelvin, his roomate. I imagined he would wake up and cried out suddenly the "Blackburn" chant and spreading "TK Theory". This would be disastrous. Better not.  as for grouping, I wonder how they decide on these. I can't find any pattern. Anyway, if we are really grouped in horoscope, I should be in gemini, and not leo. On the whole, I'm still quite happy. I can discuss MRP on my trip with Kai MIng.

      I can't believe I only got pathetic 13.3 for Lit review. It's simply horrendous. I only got 7 for intro. chapter. As a results, I only got 27.3 over 40 overall.  Well, most of the faults is due to me as I am in charge of the editing and directing the whole paper. The same cannot happen to my CPK. This results does not reflect the amount of effort I put in, and unfair to me. sorry, Kai Ming.  The Prelim 2 results is out. I'm not sure whether I should be glad or saddened, as quite many grps failed. I am 1 of them. I wonder what is really problem. I guess that's because we did not get enough experience in sec 1. I still feel Mr Gu helped us and interfered with the results. otherwise we definitley wouldn't pass even if there's prelim 4 or 5.  But at least I did not make the grave mistake of choosing RJ as my MRP parther. He seems to be very happy getting a slacking 18 (passing mark is 20), and could still laugh, rather than going through his mistake. Is he crazy? His notorious is even well-known among sec 3.   He's doomed. I wish doomslayer can just finish him off.  In comparison, Kai Ming at least did what I told him and receptive enough to my comments. I hope he would only be better for CPK, and shows more enthusiasms.  At least I got 1 out of 2, rather than losing all
