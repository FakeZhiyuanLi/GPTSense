"ur so foolish"... yaeh, guess it's ryt.. coz i know she told me already.... but still, my mind was playing me..and it sucks.. but, eventually, i fell asleep, woke up at 230 am.. and made our paper.. i slept again for about 1 and a half hour.. thn went 2 school... un... came friday.. we had a role play.. hehehe.. matrix!!... nah.. kinda lyk one.. civ class.. i really had a deep voice back thn.. ouch.. stretched out my vocals.. hehe.. thn, it our practice 4 choir again!!..&nbsp; yeah.. my 2nd 2 topmost leisure activity.. thn of course.. somehow, it made me happy.. somehow coz my mind and heart&nbsp;was occupied by a deplonging.. it's been 200 years.. w/ no communication..&nbsp;it was really killing me.. at last!! her fone rang.. ringing... ringing... ringing... tht was about ten minutes straight.. still, no answer.. startled, i sent a foolish msg..(im so sorry sf ko)... midnight came.. still nothing.. until a msg came... it was from my baby!.... yeah!!!!!!!!.. as usual, we exchanged apologies for our faults.. thn, i demanded tht she answers d fone.. hehe.. convinced her.. and&nbsp;sweet talks went for about 15 mins..&nbsp;cool.. but it was far from over it will turn out 2 be a long day after all.. a long but gratifying day.. hehe.. she called me via landlynat around 1:24 am.. and one of my greatest and happiest moment on d phone will be written in my life story... yeah.. 3 and a half hours was spent.. it was divided into four actually.. first part was d apology part, admitting our faults and misunderstandings.. 2nd part was the usual.. sweet talks, kalokohan, kulitan, and more sweet talks.. 3rd part the japan horror.. foreseeing d future.. and i almost cried.. and finally, d fourth part, the unexpected.. hehe.. i rather keep that confidential coz a lot of u people wud probably call us "weirdos".. hehehe.. it,s entitled "sweet 17"..hehehe.. (baby ko).. this day was really highlighted with the unexpected.. it started at around 11:15.. en cy and i was there at ministop.. unexpectedly, i forgot the time coz he and i fell in a conversation so damn great.. solidified my view for him.. and it feels great.. afterwards, at around 2 pm.. i met up w/ my brothers.. macky and drew.. w/c made me happier!!.. hehehe.. thn, foodcourt.. i became more and more happier!!.. not only did i spoke bicolano again.. but, my sweetheart txtd me.. unexpectedly!!... coz i knw she had a class.. then, the msg. was evn more unexpected.. she had came here in mega.. and at tht moment, she is in galle!!.. yeah!!.. w/o any hesitation, i rushed there in galle.. hoping tht i can see the person whom i longed for so much.. for 200 years...
