      I had my daughter when I was 19, and my social life died shortly thereafter. There I was, working three jobs, going to school and supporting my child %100 of the time and %100 by myself. By the time she was a year old the thought that it would be nice to have someone come along to love and care for both of us was set firmly in my mind...it just didn't happen. Some guys got scared and ran, other ignored her, and others were too selfish to care for anyone other than themselves. Behind the scenes I fought for five years just to get child support from her father through the incompetent machinations of DHR.They finally got him in court before my daughter's second birthday where the judge said, "I don't want to make the father pay anything, he needs his education." Oh! Of course, his education was much more important than mine because he's a guy, and in this state that's one step below being Christ. Here I was doing all the work myself and going to school, but still somehow Sargent Panty Waste's education was more important than mine? He was ordered to pay $100 a month. Not even enough to cover the amount of pampers she was using in that time.So, six months later he hadn't paid a cent which means that he was in contempt. No one acted to stop this. Just one year ago the amount was upped to $400. He pays on time now. We still don't see him. His choice, not mine. I am happy to say that I have graduated school and been working as a journalist for about 1 year. It feels good, but it is lonely. There is still no one in my life to fill the role of love interest for me and potential father for my daughter. I doubt there ever will be, and I have learned not hold my breath. Last night my boyfriend broke up with me by shouting "I hate you" five times at me over the phone and telling me it was going to take him a whopping two months to get over the hurt I had caused him. As the shouts of I hate you echo through my mind over and over again today, I am pretty damn sure it will hurt me much longer than that. To him, my child was something I dealt with, she was my responsibility and he never had to change his plans or modify something he might want to do with his friends for her sake.He said he wanted children and a family but never once did the fact that I couldn't find a sitter for her stop him from having plans or never did the thought that always having to drive to his place and pack up stuff for two people and get up early to take her to daycare the next day might be hard for me. People who say casually that they want children have no idea what it's really like to have to put another human being before yourself, to have to sacrifice everything you want to make that child's life a better one, and especially to do it alone. When you date someone with a child you should always consider the fact that if things get serious you may someday have to share the role of caregiver for that child. If you are uncomfortable with that, don't date someone with a child. Things with my boyfriend were serious, \or at least they seemed to be. We each had our separate appartments and I wondered why when he either stayed with me every night or I with him. He would mention marriage, buying a house, or sharing an apartment, from time to time, like he was noticing that the weather was nice out. There was never any serious intent, it seems, or a follow-up. I began to feel used and upset that I was making so much of an effort to be available to him and seeing nothing in return. Now he is gone, and I think it's for the best. I will have to explain things to my daughter and she won't understand. Really, neither do I.

      Today I had lunch with a lady from Kazakhstan and her Russian interpretor. Her name is Amangul and she is here as part of a journalism enrichment program. I have learned a lot about Kazakhstan and the people there.Amangul looks very Asian and since the people of Kazakhstan are descended from nomadic tribes, including tribes from Mongolia, this is not surprising. She has a daughter named Ursula who is my daughter's age. My daughter likes ballet and hers can dance the Samba. Her interpretor is George Krasnow and he serves as a Russian interpretor for the U.S. Department of State.Last week he was in Baton Rouge at a anti-terroist training camp for Kazakhstani soldiers. He lives in Wahington D.C. where he spends his free time watching foriegn films and going to art galleries.He defected from Russia and was once known as a persona non grata. That status has since changed and he is once again welcome to visit his family. He told me about a linguistic school in Monterey, Calif. and I am very interested in learning more about it. I always wanted to be an ambassador or to be involved in foreign relations. I would like to take some of the arrogance and ego out of the way Americans conduct themselves overseas. Listening to Amangul and George speak in Russian is a pleasant experience. Of course, I have already said the same thing about Korean, Japanese, Chinese, French, Italian, Hindi, Gaelic, and Dutch. Even Yiddish. I just like the puzzle of trying to find meaning in a vast sea of new words whose object assignment is unknown. Being able to listen to a language where the meaning isn't understood allows the listener to hear the pure sound involved in the dialect. Once words are recognized, listening is often paired with mental translation which can sometimes detract from the pure joy of just hearing foreign sound. There again, learning to communicate through means other than "universal body language" is also important. Trying to express deep convictions without a working knowledge of a language can be very difficult. Thank goodness for George.

      My editor-in-chief thought it would be a great idea for me to visit the Motorsports Hall of Fame and do a travel feature. The Hall of Fame is located at the Talladega Superspeedway. You can see it from I20 if you are headed to Atlanta, but the faraway view doesn't do justice to its gigantic glory. I've never considered myself a fan of NASCAR, in fact, it is because of the fans that I have a hard time getting involved. Examples: Mullets, overweight women in confederate bikinis, redneck drunken tomfoolery, (not my scene.) I started my tour at the hall of fame, but my guide signed me up for a tour of the raceway. I was carried by bus out to the track where we entered the infield by a narrow tunnel. Today, the Richard Petty driving school was hosting a driving session so we had a chance to watch the cars go roaring by. I got an adrenalin rush just hearing them snarl past on their way to turn 3. We took a drive along rim road where we could look down the 33 degree turns and marvel at the feats involved in racing. We watched three cars speed by and our tour guide got all misty. As soon as we got back to the hall of fame I asked to be taken out to the track for an interview. I was taken back out in a Monte Carlo pace car where I caught up with the man in charge of Fire and Safety at the races. He loaded me and my daughter into his Ford Explorer and we headed out onto the track. "I want you to watch how much I have to turn the steering wheel when I take this turn," he said, stepping on the gas and accelerating the car to 90mph. We glided effortlessly into the turn. His hand moved barely and inch up on the steering wheel and the feeling of a 33 degree turn was pure thrill. At the next big turn he slowed down the car to show me how it felt to sit sideways on the track. I felt like I was going to tumble out of my seat or that the car was going to roll downhill end over end. After that, we toured the bays where the mechanics get the cars ready before they go out to qualify. Everything about the place oozed of speed and glory. When I lay down to sleep tonight, I will dream of that first turn where gravity is defied and the whole world is momentarily altered in the name of speed. Dare I say it? Woo Hoo!

      My friend Abby and I discovered a going-out-of-business sale at a local music store so I bought a banjo, flute and tiny violin for my daughter and Abby bought a violin. We were inspired and decided to form a band where we re-did all the Nirvana songs set to banjo and violin. We were going to call it "folk you" or something the like. Anyway, the banjo just sat in my closet forever.The only thing I ever learned to play was the first few notes from "dueling banjos" but since I had no one to "duel" with...what was the point? I decided to sell the banjo and a Vera Wang dress I've had for a while. I put two ads in our paper hoping that a female, size 7 ,concert banjoist would call for both the instrument and the dress. I got a call about the banjo from this guy named Ed or Bob or Dirk (I forget) and we decided to meet so he could view the goods. As he got out of his huge black truck, my first impression is that he may be one of the same guys who played in "This is Spinal Tap." At the very least he could have been an extra. I kept expecting him to show me an amp and say "But this one goes to 11." Anyway, he bought the banjo so now its just me, a flute, and a tiny violin. The legend of "folk you" is extinguished before it ever began.

      Today I thought I would drown the sorrows of being alone by going to church in Huntsville. What a foolish damn thing to do. First, I went to the natural choice, the Episcopalians, or "partycapalians" as one studious observer noted. Due to technical difficulties (the priest was out, the replacement was ill, and my daughter had launched into a ballet extravaganza infront of perfect strangers) and some odd looks, I decided to try the Presbyterians instead. I sat at the back of the service next to a girl who, I would discover, was also there for the first time. I wondered vaugly if she was there for the same reason that I was and it made me mildly uncomfortable. We were civil to one another, all the while though, our looks said "I know why you are here." After the service, I decided to stick around for the Sunday school portion, thinking this would be the perfect opportunity to meet people my age and let them help me forget how badly I hurt inside when no one is around to distract me. I was introduced to a man and his wife who told me about a group called "The Young and the Restless,"- "Although we're really not like the soap opera," the man added before breaking out into boisterous laughter with his wife over the apparent "funny" he had just made. I was led to a classroom filled with people that were neither "young" nor "restless". The women each had a band of gold and a diamond on their fingers and the men were balding and going paunchy about their mid-sections. The women all lacked anything that could clearly be defined as a "chin" and their breasts had all begun a rather tragic journey southward. I was mortified. Why in the hell wasn't I in with the college kids? I had a chin, I had perky breasts, dammit! It was the fact that I had a daughter. The natural assumption was that I BELONGED with these people. One woman bragged about her guitar performance in front of 3,000 people while another worried about getting settled in her new home. The guitar soloist nodded sympathetically and admitted that she and her husband had yet to decide where to hang all their photos. My heart sank to the ground. I wanted a ring and a home and all this idle chit chat and I had just lost the one person in the world who I loved more than anything. My eyes stung with tears and so I fled the church with my daughter and had a good cry about everything on our way up to Monte Sano and Burrit on the Mountain. We arrived before they had actually opened, but we crawled over the small fence and I sat in solitude on the bench. As I gazed out across the city of Huntsville toward the giant mock-up rocket of the Space and Rocket Center, I wondered what HE was doing and if maybe he had called me while I was away. I had this foolish hope that it would be okay, but as time goes on and he doesn't call or come by, I lose the hope and I break down into tears. I can't sleep, I don't want to eat, and the passage of time drags the sinking feeling in my chest down further. I remember the last conversation we had, how cold he was. I had never heard him use the tone of voice he had used, and then, he hung up on me. I started shaking when the line went dead and my arms felt like they weighed a ton. He didn't care anymore. This is the reality I wake to at 2:30, 4:30 and 6a.m. in the morning. I would give anything to change what I said and to make it all better, anything. But there is nothing to do when the other person has given up on you. When they despise you, there is nothing left to do but let time drag by and just hope to God it gets better soon.
