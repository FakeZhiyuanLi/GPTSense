       What the ****?!  The Indians are officially the team that causes emotion in extremes.  One week, you're excited because they're doing so well, and the next week, you're angry because they're not doing anything.  Case in point: last weekend they took the Twins twice, outscoring them by a lot.  Tonight they lost by four, scoring only one run.  What is with that?  I know that teams will have off nights, but they are quite capable of beating the Twins, plus this is the 5th loss in a row.  That is not the kind of streak a team who is "in" a pennant race should be going on.  However, I don't believe it is completely their fault because the umpires were pretty crappy...they lost a few chances due to those jerks.  All I know is that I'm not happy right now, and it's all because of a silly game.  I guess it's just that I know they can play better than they're playing, so the losses are their faults and so I'm mad at them for losing.      Is there anything else I can talk about at this point?  If God takes the time to read blogs, I am personally asking that the Tribe get their aggressiveness back.  I'm not asking for me, even though I enjoy watching them win more than watching them lose, but for them.  The whole lot of them seem like a really great group of guys who get along well together and play well together.  It's not fair for them all to lose their swing at the same time, not to mentiong losing games as a group effort.  They deserve to feel like winners.      Hmm...I dont' feel like I've said everything I need to say, but I can think of nothing else.  Until next time, I guess...

       Ugh!  I don't know exactly what it is about the Texas Rangers, but they have paralized the Indians again.  They had trouble fielding and hitting throughout the entire series.  I realize that a team can't win every day, but I also know that (especially as a teacher) I expect the best out of everyone every time they do something.  Now, down thar in Texas, the Indians did not play their best, which is the main reason that I'm disappointed in them.  The brightest spot about the whole three game series was that Jody Gerut was actually starting to hit again.  And as glad as I am for him, I just have to say: Why can't you be hitting when everyone else is hitting?  Oh the damage that could be done!  *Sigh*  Whatever.      As an aside, the stupid Yankees aren't doing their jobs to help us out either.  They're supposed to be beating the crap out of the Twins (who are the current arch rivals) so that we don't go down in the standings.  No, they have to lose to them.  All I have to say is that they better be as kind to us next week when they come to Cleveland (especially Monday since I'll be there).  And I do hope that the Rangers are as tough on the dumb Twins as they were on us.      How can anyone think that baseball becoming my hobby is not a good thing?  The emotional rollercoaster I've been on all summer with this team is better than any rollercoaster any stupid guy could put me on.  Please note, when I talk about the team, I talk as I am a part of it.  I am.  Anyone who devotes that much time and caring to any team is definately a part of the team.      I suppose my rant is over.  The Tribe has a day off tomorrow, and I hope they use it resting.  Travis seems to be slightly injured and we really need him back.  They need to be ready to take on the Twins this weekend and get back that close gain on them.  Oh, one more thing.  Recently Josh  Phelps has been aquired from the Blue Jays.  He's played in several games so far, both as a 1st baseman and a DH.  I still don't see the advantage of having him.  Perhaps he's in a slump, but I'm not too appreciative of him right now.      I had something non-baseball related to say earlier, but I've now forgotten.   Oh well.

       I've never done one of these before, but I wanted to give it a try.  No offense to anyone who may read this, but I'm not too keen on giving too much personal info, so I prefer that you don't ask.  Whatever I write is what you get. WARNING: This is about me.  I find that I don't often get to talk about myself, so I don't want this to come off that I only think/talk about myself, I don't.  Just here.  If you're bored, leave.  I thank you.      Since mid-April I have had a great deal of interest in the Cleveland Indians baseball team.  I'm not sure why exactly, but I have a few ideas.  I was on spring break from school, and went to spend some time with my grandma, who has been an avid Indians fan for as long as I can remember.  I've seen games at her house, but never had interest in it before.  While I was there, we watched the game, of course.  However, while watching, I started getting different feelings about it.  There was something about this team...this group of guys, who made it so enjoyable to watch.  They weren't winning too many games at that point in the season, so I know that it wasn't because I just wanted to be going for a winning team, and as far as I knew, they hadn't done much in they way of winning in a long time.  The next day, I went home and found myself watching the game again that night...and the next night and the next night and so on.      Soon enough, I was checking their stats online, looking for people to go to games with, and running all over Ohio looking to meet them at signings.  Yeah, my family and friends were starting to think I'd gone crazy...and I wasn't too sure I wasn't.      I can honestly say I've seen almost every game that's been televised this year.  I've missed just a few.  I've made it to three.  Two I saw in Detroit, but the best experience was my first time at  Jacob's Field.  It was so wonderful to be part of a crowd that was cheering for the same team I was (I didn't get that in Detroit).  Not that I minded getting booed in Detroit, it was just more fun to be part of such a massive crowd of energy, directing it in the same direction.      Earlier I mentioned that I have an idea why this "obsession" has come about.  Ever since adolesence you could say I've been a bit boy crazy.  Not that I was always liking different guys, but I cannot remember a time that I didn't like at least one.  Well, around the time that I found the Indians, I realized that I had to let go of my recent crush.  He was leaving the country for awhile only to return and move across the country.  It was a difficult thing to do, as I have never not had sights set on someone.  I know it sounds a little lame/crazy to replace a guy with a team of them, but they've kept my attention all summer and have also kept me out of trouble.      I guess that's enough of an introduction.  Most of the postings here will probably be about the Indians or baseball.  Since I don't quite feel confident leaving messages on the Indians message board forum, I thought I would have my own where no one could tell me I'm wrong.
