      What an incredible day!  I'm participating in an asthma study for the hospital and one of the things they do is a couple of extra ultra sounds. So Mum and I went to the hospital and we got to see you on the screen. I told the girl that i would like to know the sex if possible and she said she would try. Half way through the ultra sound, she said 'well i'm definately looking at a scrotum'. I just laid there with a smile on my face and didn't say anthing. She said 'that means its a boy'. I kinda laughed and said i know.  So YOU'RE A BOY!!!!! It was really exciting to find that out. Then they used some of the latest technology and showed us your face in 3D. It was almost like a camera had been put in my tummy and i got to see how you look. You are so beautiful!!  Your ultra sound 28/06/04&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     After that i had another anti-D injection and a blood test and came home. I felt completely poked and prodded, but it was definately worth it! As soon as i got out of the hospital, i messaged about 30 people from my phone to tell them your sex. Everyone is so excited, especially me.  Your aunty Jo has decided to stay in Newcastle for an extra day when she comes up so that she can see your next ultrasound at 37 weeks.

      Well it was another fun filled day in pregnancy land...  After a bit of study on philosophy at the library, i headed home for a nap, then onto the Brewery for a light meal with a women's group. Then Erin and Lisa came back home and after gushing at all your baby clothes, we watched the shining.  Erin and Lisa gushing over baby stuff&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      A drawing by Erin for my computer desktop because she said it was boring.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     It was a fun day but I just wish I would stop getting 'baby pains' cause they make trying to have a social life hard. But just 6 more weeks and you'll be here and together we'll have a completely different set of pains and problems to deal with.  I'm off to the hospital tomorrow (well actually today, its almost 1:30am!!) and we might find out your sex. Fingers crossed hey!!  Mum

      Last night was a VERY long night. I didn't manage to fall asleep until about 2am or so, and then i had reflux all night. Every 30 minutes i was waking up with a burning throat and there wasn't much i could do about it. I had 2 doses of mylanta in 2 hours (naughty naughty) but that really didn't seem to do anything.  Then today i had to go to the bank early, so after about 3 hours sleep i was walking around Cardiff when i had some really bad pains. Then driving back home, the pains got worse. I swear i thought i was going into labour. But after a really bland muffin, i went back to sleep for a couple of hours and then felt better.  So today when i should have been studying for my psychology exam that's on Tuesday, i've been resting and relaxing all day. I'm a bit worried that i wont have a chance to study, but i figure if i fail, its only philosophy.  Well i finally took a photo of my belly today. It's about time considering that you're going to be here in 6 weeks (or less!!). Erin got one of me a couple of months ago, but i still haven't copied it yet. What can i say, i'm hopeless!!!   My belly at 6 weeks and 1 day&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     I brought a digital camera yesterday. I got it for $239 insted of up to $320 that i've seen it for. I also got extra memory so i can take up to 117 photo's at a time. I figure that i'll need it considering how camera happy i am.   I also got your layby off last night. Gran gave me $200 to cover the car seat and i also got you some bottles and a steriliser, some blankets for your bed, sheets for your cradle and a couple of little body suits. All things considered, i think i have everything i need for you now. All i have to organise is a house and car.....but they're the easy part (not).  Tonight i plan on just taking it easy and finding something to eat that doesn't burn my throat. Wish me luck!!!  Mum

      Well you're due in 6 weeks and 3 days and i'm definately counting. While a lot of people look at me and ask where you could possibly be hiding, i'm definately feeling the extra weight of carying you around.  It has been an interesting pregnancy. I wouldn't say that i've completely enjoyed it, but i haven't hated it either.  I had morning sickness for about a month. It started at about 11:30pm and finished about 3:30pm. Thank goodness that didn't last! I've had some funny stuff going on with my blood pressure but the doctor assures me that i'm fine, but i don't agree. Sometimes my pulse is racing so much that i think my heart is going to leap out of my chest.  The only thing i've really missed while being pregnant is falling asleep on my stomach. I never realised how much i enjoyed it until i couldn't do it.  The ups of the pregnancy would have to be the first couple of kicks. I felt like there was an alien inside of me. Sometimes you kick so strongly that i'm surprised i don't get bruised. Other times you roll over and my whole stomach wobbles. It looks really weird.  I've been making the most of the last few months that i'll have as a single person. I've been clubbing quite a bit and socialising as much as possible because i know that once you're born, its going to be pretty hard to do those types of things.   urlLink    Your big brother, Cai Anthony Haslberger&nbsp; urlLink     Your father messaged me today, asking how we both are. He's certain that you're a girl, but that's only because he has a boy already. We keep in contact about once every 2 weeks, but sometimes i feel it isn't enough. I wish that he could be here and play a major role in your life, but i'm sure that he will do the best that he can. And so will we.   urlLink    Your father and I&nbsp; urlLink      We have gotten heaps of presents off people already and i plan on taking photos of everything and putting it on here. One person we wouldn't be able to do without is your aunty Jo. She has given us everything from books, clothing, high chairs, toys, your cradle and even your pram.   Your grandparents have been wonderful. They let me move back in here as soon as i found out that i was pregnant and we're staying until you're about 6 weeks old. Then we'll move out into our own house. Without them we wouldn't have been able to save the money we need to live happily.  All things considered, we are pretty lucky. You will have everything you need before you're born and with the government giving out $3000 bonuses for giving birth, i'll be able to buy a car so we'll be able to get around easily.   I will get around to posting pictures of everything we have been given soon. I'm still in the middle of my exams, but once they are over i'll be concentrating on preparing everything for your arrival.  Mum

      I had an ultrasound for the asthma study and they were able to tell me that you weighed about 6 pounds and they gave me some pictures of your face. It took forever to get them because you were sleeping on your arm. The woman doing the ultrasound kept poking you really hard through my side trying to get you to move your arm. It took awhile, but it was definately worth it. 3D ultrasound&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      Sunday night was Dad's birthday. It was not the best night for me. I had contractions start at about 4ish and they continued late into the night. I was able to go out for dinner because they were infrequent and not overly painful. About 8pm my back started aching and i wanted to go home. When we got home, Andrew was in the shower so as soon as he got out i ran a bath, but there was no hot water!!! I had mum boiling the kettle and saucepans on the stove while i was hunched over my bed with Joanne massaging my back. I said to Jo that if these were Braxton Hicks, i didn't want to have a full on labour.  Mum

      We've been really lucky because your Aunty Jo has kept all of Lachlan's and Callum's clothes and toys and she has lent them to us for as long as you need them. Aunty Jo&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Pram&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Baby Cradle&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Baby clothing. Not all of it's from Aunty Jo, some of it is also from Gran, Friends and I&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Some of the toys Aunty Jo gave you&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     I've been busy over the past few months. I've tried my hand at folk art so that i could paint you some dragons. I wanted a mythical creatures theme for your nursery, but it is kinda all over the place at the moment. When we move into our own house it should be easier to set up. Wet Dragon&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Butterfly dragon&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Flower Dragon&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Your Dad also sent me a message tonight saying that he missed us, which was nice. I'm looking forward to him coming down in October to meet you and stay with us for a few weeks. I think it's really important that you have some contact with him, even if its only occasionally.   I had an antenatal visit yesterday. The doctor said my uterus is 38cm long which means that it has grown 7cm in 2.5 weeks!!! He said that you're a decent size...but i hope you're not too big or you wont fit out!!  Well considering it's almost 5am, i should be going back to bed. Aunty Jo and Uncle Andy arrived at 3:30am so that's why i'm up. They've driven all the way up here to come to Grans 70th birthday which is tomorrow. So i know that i'm going to need my rest if i'm going to cope with the party, your cousins and being pregnant at the same time.  Mum

      Well it's been a while since i've had time to write. I've been really busy preparing for your arrival and for Gran's 70th birthday.  Amongst party preparations, Grandma had been painting your cradle. There were 3 coats which took over and hour and a half each!! It looks great though.  'Grandma' painting your cradle&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    The finished product&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Last week Grandma and i went to Sydney to visit Aunty Sharon. We ended up shopping which was great because i got to get you a change table, nappy bag and nappy bucket. Sharon got you 2 really soft towels and Grandma got you an outfit to come home from hospital in. Change Table&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Nappy Bag&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    This actually reminds me that i still have to give Grandma the money for those things!!! She wanted to pay for them for you, but i think she has definately given you enough.  Well it's 3 weeks and 3 days until your arrival and i'm both scared and excited. I saw a birthing video at antenatal classes last week and it has really terrified me. I don't know how i'm going to fit you out! I keep trying to just think beyond the birth, but i don't think it's working. Well i guess that whether i like it or not, you're coming out so i'd better get use to the idea.  Mum

      Grandma and i have finally finished your cot. It was definately a joint effort and took ages, but it looks amazing.  Your cot finished&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    The mattress Grandma made&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    I've also been given my present for having you (even though you aren't here yet!) from Grandma and Grandad. It's a comfy chair that i should be able to sit in for hours while i'm desperately trying to figure out breastfeeding.  The recliner Grandma and Grandad gave me&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    I also took another photo of my tummy so you can see how much you've grown.

      Well i've finally finished 'our' nursery.We are sharing a bedroom while we live at Grandma's and Grandad's, so i've done my best to make it look like a baby's room.
