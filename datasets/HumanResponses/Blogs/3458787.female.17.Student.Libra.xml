      Never thought I would actually start blogging. Most of my friends have had blogs for a long long long time now. It was always interesting to read their blogs but it never before occurred to me to create a blog myself before this.   I previously could not imagine myself writing my thoughts about issues and about my life on any web page. You can say I'm kind of an introvert to an extent. I rather not talk too much about myself to people I don't exactly know well.   But after a while, haha somewhat 2 months back, I started my blog. I don't exactly write anything very personal on my blog (unlike most people). I still strongly believe in having total privacy about what happens in my life. Well it all depends on the person I guess- how much they want to reveal about themselves to others and how much they don't.  Well, anyway, back to my main point... BLOGGING IS FUN! It just feels good to be writing my 14th blog :) No significance to the number 14 but just that its double digit LOL.

      I was born and bred in Singapore. Yup I'm a true blue Singaporean and I'm proud to be one too! LOL Most Singaporeans do not "admit" their patriotism to Singapore but come on all you Singaporeans out there I'm sure deep down in your heart somewhere there is a special place for Singapore.  Singapore is actually interesting I should say although most would classify it boring. I which other country do you have a big green dustbin every 10 metres you walk down the street? In which other country can you get from one end of the country to another in less than an hour? Where else will you see such long queues at McDonald's to get a free toy? In Singapore and nowhere else...   FOOD!!! You can get everything and anything here- no questions asked. I need not say anymore do I? LOL  And best of all Singapore is where I made my BEST of best friends and will enjoy the BEST of best years..

      Survivor, The Amazing Race, Fear Factor, Temptation Island, Paradise Hotel, For Money or Love?, The bachelor, Joe Millionaire and the list goes on and on and on...  The television claims this as "reality" TV. But come on who are they trying to fool? In which world is it reality to be given a million bucks for solving clues placed all round the world? Or for that matter no guy in the world will be allowed to openly flirt with 10 girls at one time and finally choose one. Its all pretty dumb if you think about. It's all made up situations just for entertainment. But I must admit it is fun watching these hysterically funny shows.  Most of these shows have little depth and just brings out the worst in people. To get the prize money in the end, many of the contestants in these "reality" shows turn into complete money hungry hypocrites who do not care less about the feelings of others. Maybe I'm being a little harsh here but still... I'm sure you know what I mean...

      For those of you who don't know, I'm an only child to my parents- I've got no siblings. Whenever I say that to people their first reaction would be, " Oh wow! That's so good! That means you get whatever you ask for from your parents, right?" And I think to myself, "Oh man, what a big misconception these people are in!".  When something goes wrong in the house for some reason all the fingers always point at me. Let's say the TV in my house stopped working. The first thing that I will be asked is, " Hey VALLI! What in the world did you do to the TV!" when I would not even have touched it for hours. Then there are other stuff too.   Although I'm 18 now (ok ok 17+ exactly), a mature young adult in the eyes of the law, my parents still doubt my ability to look after myself when I'm home alone- they will call to check on me like a gazillion times.  Then there is the issue of money. I'm still being given daily allowance (haha but I should say I probably get loads and loads more than some of my friends I I sum my all that I get). My parents feel that I'm not old enough to handle large sums of money without spending it ( REMINDER! I'm going on 18 this September!). I'm still seen as a "baby" in their eyes.    Ok, I have to be fair so I will admit that I think that there is quite a bit of an advantage being an only child or so I believe from what I hear. Firstly, in my life there is no such thing as sibling rivalry (duh!) or "passed down" toys or clothes. Everything I own is entirely mine and mine only haha. This is good to an extent I guess but I have to say that I miss out on all the "fun" of being able to borrow my "big sister's" clothes and feel like a grown-up wearing them.   Grass is always greener on the other side for some reason. I've always wanted a sibling- be it younger or older(through I prefer the latter a little more than the other). I always wondered how it would be to have a person to talk to whenever and whatever you want to. A person who will know you inside out. A person to share you deep inner feelings about issues and who you are very certain that you can tell ALL your secrets to. A person like a brother or sister! :)

      Soccer is a weird game. 11 guys (most are good looking :p) run after one pathetic spherical object with the aim of getting it pass a guy who stands waving his hands in front of a large net. As weird as it may seem, I still like watching it LOL :)  The EURO Cup 2004 in Portugal has started yet another soccer fever in the world :)  The opening match between Portugal and Greece to me and I bet everyone else too by surprise. I never once, before the match, thought that Greece may actually win the match.  But six minutes through (when Greece scored their 1st goal) I found myself supporting the Greeks. The Portuguese were playing a very haphazard game where there seem no be no flow or planning. Their expected smoothness and confidence must have hit rock bottom after their opponent's goal. It was indeed a sad game for then- 1st match, playing in home grounds against underdogs... And LOST!   Then came France vs England- that was war against the goal keepers! Too many penalties and free kicks to be given out. Apparently France's goalie is better :)

      Today had we had a friendly shoot with VJC I finally beat my personal best score of 354... Its now 358!!  The day started off bad. Woke up with a sore throat and a blocked nose and my head felt rather heavy- very clear: I was going to get a cold. But I had no choice as I had  a competition to go for. I got ready and dragged my feel to the MRT station. It was one long, boring train ride to CDANS Country Club that lasted for approximately an hour. Finally I got there.  Soon it was my detail. I picked up my shooting shoes and air pistol and proceeded to my lane. I went through my shooting routine. I was shoot well. The words of my teacher rang through my head over and over again, " Let the feelings, emotions and thoughts pass. Focus on each shot. Take one shot at a time." I shot one shot after another. Each was to me a separate and individual shot. It felt good even though my nose and throat were bad- something like a bright glowing light in the middle of pitch darkness. During the shoot it felt as though I had almost complete control over my trigger and all the thoughts and emotions that ran through my head. It was an amazing feeling! And the just like that-358!  When I think about it now, I could have shot 360 only if I had not shot the 6 on my last series. It need not even have been perfect 10(bullseye). Just an 8 would have been enough for me to hit 360. But I guess the joy of hitting 360(90%) is reserved for another day someday soon- just not today.

      Its one of those days again- when you feel like just slacking around, sleep and lazing around. Went for training in the morning so the entire morning was gone. So now I've got half a day more to do whatever I want to but just don't feel like doing anything worthwhile. Hmmm.. thinking about it, I should in fact be studying( commons comming up very very soon) but just don't feel like it.   Life is very weird don't you think? I mean at the moment I have all the time in the world and I don't want to do anything proper. Later when I won't have the time, I would want to do so many thing.    Humans as a whole are weird creatures. We always what to do things that we can't do, should not do or out of our reach. We always what something that we can't reach or have. We want to discover the unknown when we do not even know the known thoroughly. In a way we follow Lenz's Law- our brain diectly opposes whatever if present in our lives (hahah my physics lecturer will be proud of me :)  )  The Human race should try to be satisfied with what they have and not crave for what they don't. People should develop what they have to satisfy themselves and not just be jealous of others and covet what others have and they don't.  Humans are by far the most amazing and excellent creatures living on Earth but oddly, at the same time they need to learn so much more from other creatures.

      Wow..Amazing eh? It has already been almost 2 years since I left Cedar(my secondary school) I would classify the 4 years I spent there as the most wonderful, eventful and closest to my heart.. TOTALLY enjoyed myself there to the maximum :)  The work load there was not large. Studies went very smoothly and best of all I enjoyed every single thing I did there-  from class activities to Tamil class activities to prefectorial board stuff.  Tamil class was the best there hahaha never thought that I would actually say Tamil class was nice..hahah but truthfully I did enjoy it! Actually it was not the learning part (not at all the learning part actually). It was in fact the people and the teacher. It was a time to relax, chat (a lot.. Always used to get scolded! Me and my really really good friend- you know who you are- of mine used to sit next to each other and talk about everything in the world except about the stuff happening in class *guilty guilty* We were always in our own world..haha to make things better we used to sit in one far end of the class :)  ) I will always remember the times when we and the teacher used to just simply talk totally un-Tamil related stuff.. about my teacher's family, stuff happening in school etc etc.. mind you, we had our ways to divert my teacher away from official class discussions :) Then there were the times we got some of my friends to sing for us in the name of practicing for competitions hehehe (they are really good singers).   Then there was the prefectorial board.. had all those fun and hysterical cleaning the prefects' room session and the trashing the juniors sessions..LOL we were quite mean at times to our juniors I guess (hahah if anyone of you are reading this..I'm really sorry hahaha). Loved the late nights spent in school esp. all those camps..we spooked ourselves with the many ghost stories about school (the clock tower, the toilets, the old building etc..hahah you will understand why when you see where my school is situated- its right next to a cemetery).  The 4 years spent in Cedar went by in a flash. Soon it was time to give my valedictorian speech. Everyone continued on with their separate lives in different directions. Many of my friends went overseas while others went to different colleges. But of cause there some who came along with me to NJ to start yet another chapter of our exciting lives...

      In east London a British robber stole 115,000 pounds in cash from Barclays Bank. But surprise surprise- a week later he broken into the bank once again to return most of the money (104,000 pounds)BACK!   I assume it must have been guilt. " It's NOT your money! You don't need that much money! You thief!" his inner voice must have tormented him inside out. But the interesting part of his whole case is that the robber did not give back all the money. I mean if he is going to go through the trouble of breaking into the bank once again he might as well give back everything he stole. He must have desperately needed the money but felt terribly guilty about stealing and hence he gave back what he no longer required.  How in the world would you classify such a person? You and i both will agree that what he did is wrong- stealing is clearly wrong no matter what. But at the same time, he had the courage and "goodness" in him to return most of the money. Interesting character eh? haha you never know.. he might actually break in yet again and return the rest of the money once he gets it back. Will shall wait and see....

      Walnut, peanut, cashewnut. My obsession with nuts started not long ago just about 3 to 4 years back. This tale starts with one of my very good friends who first started to call me "NUT" (fondly of cause). That nickname just caught on so easily and tagged along with me ever since.   Weird as it may sound, I grew to associate myself with nuts. If a caricature myself is ever drawn I can't imagine it without having a nut somewhere in it. Most people associate nuts with being foolish, silly or crazy (think of the term nutcase for example) but I think of it differently.  A nut has a hard and rough shell outside it but the inside is smooth and yummy. Likewise, I'm a very frank person. Some things that I say hurt people at times(just like the shell) but I mean good (just like the nut inside). hahah...I'm getting nutty ( never thought I would come up with such an analogy).  Well on the lighter side, I just love eating nuts! hahaha Yummy!  That's my nutty nut story for you!

      A nicely wrapped present sits on top of your table. What is in it? Who is it from? Who put it there? All these thoughts run through your head in a split second from seeing the present. CURIOSITY.  You walk out of your house and see a huge mob of people crowding around the nearby shopping centre. You want to know what's going on. Is there a flimstar coming to town? Maybe there is a discount sale? Some how your legs subconsciously walk towards the shopping centre. CURIOSITY.  You see your friend writing furiously in a small book. What is he writing? Is that book his diary? You try to take a take a peak. CURIOSITY.  The unknown, the unimaginable, the uncomprehendable. All these trigger this small(ok maybe not that small) something in your brain that urges you to find out more, understand better or just intrude in other people's business. This small something is CURIOSITY.  Curiosity is what develops the thinking mind making the person creative and innovative. Scientists depend on curiosity to drive them to greater heights.  But it is also the very thing that is the root of all gossip.  Curiosity buds off as hot gossip- the unusual need to know details about the lives of others even though gained information is of no valuable use.  Love it or hate it, you have to agree that curiosity is sometimes good; sometimes bad. It all depends on how you make use of it in your life. As always there are no absolutes in the world that we live in.

      News Headlines today: Ronald Reagan dies at 93  That got me thinking quie a bit. The 40th president of USA was an actor. Actors get lots of recognition nowadays and many have turned to politics to rise further in power and fame. But i should say, not all are that good as politicl leaders (Dont get me wrong here, I'm not trying to say that Ronald Reagan was a bad president) But nevertherless, people still vote for them- is it just a dillusion after watching "their" heroic deeds in movies or do they really trust those actors to lead their nation to greater heights?

      There is a group of people in this world who's only pleasure is to entertain others- these are an amazing group of people called ENTERTAINERS.     I went to see the Moscow Circus in action today at Tampines Central. It was amazing! To think about it, those people there eat, sleep and probably even dream the circus- it's their life. These people dedicate their life to entertain others ( of course they will get money and all). They would not have the pleasure of staying put&nbsp;in one place and have a ordinary life like the rest of us. They will always be on the move. It will be a hard life as I imagine it to be.   It's indeed sad that&nbsp;the circus profession is slowly dying off. Many are running in a loss and less and less people are interested to join the circus.&nbsp;But&nbsp;I do really hope that many more generations will be able to enjoy the fun&nbsp;and&nbsp;awesome tricks showed in circuses.&nbsp;

      I stepped into this relatively dark room with a weird ventilator sound. Though I had never been in there before, it somewhat seemed homely and nice. In a way inviting I guess. Days went by, I came down almost everyday. Each day I&nbsp;shot more holes&nbsp;on this square card. Then somehow the hole became more compact and bigger-&nbsp;interesting I thought. I guess I was not that bad at it after all.   Then suddenly I was a part of this new amazing family. Wow! A hugh one..believe me. We ran 10 rounds around this 400 metre circle every other week together, we lifted this small wheel like things,&nbsp;we perspired and laughed and were "tortured" together.&nbsp;We&nbsp;shot&nbsp;more and more holes on cards together as well. There were also times when we had to stare into blank space and think about holes in cards as some form of training. It was all amazing.   Then came a comeptition&nbsp;to shoot holes and see&nbsp;who can shoot better holes.&nbsp;We were just great. Oh man.. we can really shoot holes! But of course,&nbsp;in the end some were left really happy why&nbsp;others did not do as well but in the end everyone was a winner because&nbsp;we are one family&nbsp;after&nbsp;all.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      It's amazing how in one part of the world people of differnt races are living together, dependent on one other to satisfy each others' needs and helping each other out in times of need&nbsp;while in&nbsp;another part of&nbsp;the same world, people&nbsp;of different races&nbsp;virtually hate each other and look&nbsp;down on people who are of other races. &nbsp;I am very fortunate to have been born on the better part of the world.  &nbsp;  It's great to be openly accepted by all regardly of what race or what religion. It's fun to share racist jokes and laugh at them all regardless of which race the joke is biased against. It's fun to learn about the culture and traditions of others and it's nice to know that other people are interested in learning more about your culture as well. For some (mostly those living in the other side of the world) all this would seem too&nbsp;idealistic and far from reality. But not for me! I have to thank my friends (from all races and religions) for this! :)

      You know, when I was younger much younger like when I was 6 or 7 years old, I used to bug my mother&nbsp;buy breakfast cereals that had really nice pictures on the box. For example, cornflakes boxes always showed strawberries along with the cornflakes. I used to think there really were strawberries inside. How disappointed I was when all that was inside&nbsp;was confakes that was not even honey coated!  &nbsp;  At one point of time I more or less believed that spinach made you mighty strong. That was was watching Popeye the sailor man everyday&nbsp;do to me!  &nbsp;  Then there were these doll houses that they&nbsp;advertise repeatedly on TV. They always showed the houses with SO many dolls and even the doll house boxes&nbsp;have pictures of dolls on them! I&nbsp;had many a time failed to see the faint print that&nbsp;read " dolls and accessories not included" and been&nbsp;fooled.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  It did not&nbsp;make much sense to me at that time when in cartoons, stories&nbsp;and even in some movies animals could talk but in real live they never did.  &nbsp;  When I think about all these things now, it is&nbsp;all so funny but when I was little these were the stuff that made me really disappointed hahahhahaha :)

      We all have ideals that we try to live up to and there are people we respect and admire. And there&nbsp;is also this certain group of people whom we do not really know (can say they are acquaintances or maybe sometimes even a little more than that) but just see something in them that we do not have- sometimes its the way they carry themselves, some behaviour of theirs or maybe just the way they look.  &nbsp;  In your mind, you see them as really nice, interesting people that you would like to get to know better. You basically have a very positive impression of them. Then when you come to discover that they do stuff that are against your ideals (for example if they lied to someone, tried to smoke or drink when they are underaged&nbsp;or stole something for just the trill of it), you tend to get really disappointed. You don't immediately get a negative impression of them - you still like them and all but you get really disappointed with them and kind of feel sad. Have you ever experienced such stuff before?

      IT'S SO SOON!!!  That day- I sat in front of the computer deciding what JC i should go to.. VJ or NJ or TJ.. I came to a decision and it was National Junior College! And a whole new journey begun.  &nbsp;  I still remember the day I first stepped into NJC. It was some STAR programme introduction thing.&nbsp; I was somewhat excited and anxious about how the 2 years in NJ will turn out to be.  &nbsp;  The first time I stepped into the range- felt foreign, overwhelmed and&nbsp;very interested.  My first target&nbsp;card- 2 out of 5 shots&nbsp;on the card (hahahahahhaha I must have been really bad!)  &nbsp;  My first group of new friends(in my 1st class)- a few people from 03s19  &nbsp;  My new class- the ever nutty and supposedly the 'Normal Tech' of NJC (I bet all of you remember who said that :p)...03S17 hahahaha  &nbsp;  My first common test results- B B C&nbsp;D (oh boy that sounds great compared to what I have been getting lately hahahahaha)  &nbsp;  My first..my first..my first...  &nbsp;  And after almost&nbsp;2 memorble years in NJC... 'my firsts' are now changing to 'my lasts'  &nbsp;  My last shoot in NJC- Nationals (we got gold! yay! :) )  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Its amazing how time flies..and very soon we will start yet another new journey...

      We packed our stuff into our Silver Hyundai Accent and started our 6 hour journey back to Singapore. The drive was pretty smooth- avoided a few monitor lizards with a few smooth turns and swerves, over took a couple of slow moving lorries and took a steady speed of about 100Km/hr in the almost deserted Expressway.  I was siting beind my Dad who was driving- happily chatting and critising the songs that were being played on the radio while munching on some pringles potato chips.   The road was becoming a little bad. They were doing some repair works here and there but nothing terribly worrying or delay causing.   Suddenly there was a light blue car just in front of us. Why was it not moving? Or was it moving very slowing? It was too near for comfort. My Dad pressed onto the breaks. Our car screeched. We were slowed down drastically but had not stopped yet. Why were we not stopping?! My mind went blank. BANG!  No one was injured luckly(seat belts did their job well). The light blue car's bumper was a little smashed but nothing that $200 could not fix. Nothing much happened to our car except that our number plate had been smashed and had 3 large cracks on it.  It was a close call- an experience to remember for a long long time to come!

      Malaysia is just a across the causeway but it's so very different from Singapore. There is a complete change in atmosphere and surroundings on the other side.   I went to Kuanthan, Malaysia this weekend and many things that I saw there got me thinking. You can say that Kuanthan is about approximately the Bukit Timah area here in Singapore. A pretty small town near the seaside area that has seen many recent developments in terms of technological advancements.    From my 9th story hotel room window I could see the entire skyline- awesome. Thats something you will never get to see in singapore. Too many tall skyscrapers to block the view hahaha.  The pace of life there seems much more relaxed too. You hardly see people rushing from one place to another and everyone always seems to have the time to just sit back and relax. No one seems to be in a hurry.   But have to add that its not all that great there either! haha In my opinion, Singapore is a much better place to live! :) I'm always a patriotic Singaporean- ALWAYS!   Most shops close at around 10 there. Pretty much a dead town after that- just loads of cars but no people. People there don't seem to think that walking is a way of getting from one place to another. You almost never see people walking around (that some what explains why there don't seem to be any pavements there). People around there didn't seem to know their town that well either so most of the time we kept driving in circles haha.  oh ya one more thing- you GOT to know malay or you are equivalent to an alien hahah (good for us my Dad knows a little Malay)

      Hey hey hey the GREEKS won EURO 2004!!!!!!!! Amazing eh? For a team that could not even qualify to play in the tournament previously, they have made it far- really really far. Who would have ever thought they would win?  The unthinkable and the unimaginable always happens in life don't you think? I mean which person in 100A.D. would have thought that it would be possible for people to travel around the world so easily? For that matter, who at that time would have even thought the Earth was actually spherical?!?!  Lets take 2 years ago for example. I never thought I would take up shooting as my hobby. It never even occurred to me once that I would end up in NJC!  Its funny how life has so many twists and turns. Nothing is ever predictable. Its impossible for me to be 100% sure that I will do something tomorrow until that exact time comes. Call me disorganised or unsure about myself if you want but I believe its the same for everyone- not only me.

      Some would say its the Internet because it connects the world and is the basis of a global village idealogy.  Others would say is probably the television just because it keeps them company during the most boring of times.  Teachers would say it is the pen because then they can make students write exams! hahahahaahahahah  The handphone will be  popular choice for many as some can't live without it!!!! hhahaha I bet many of you are guilty of this!  Some would say it is the lift. These are the lazy ones!  Then there are those who believe it's the calculator (the Mathemagicians of course)  HAHAHAHHHAAH but I think its the toilet bowl for obvious reasons!!!! LOL

I wish I could swim!!! hahaha This I really did try but the instructor was like SO scary that I eventually just gave up learning! hahah I can float though..  I wish I had the power turn invisible. Not because I want to find out about the private lives of others or what people think of me. Don't worry- I don't want to rob a bank either! Its just that it would be really nice to be all by myself at times without people looking for me or bugging me..hahaha  I wish I had the stamina to run forever! I love the feel of the wind blowing against my face and I love running simply because it can be an endless activity. The only thing that is stopping me is the exhaustion and panting...hahahah  I really would love to learn sign language. I believe that sign language would open the doors to a whole new world that I presently can't appreciate or truly understand. It's something that I have dreamt of learning since very young but have not found the time or a good course that suits me. But I definitely will learn it in the future :)  I wish there were more than 24 hours in each day! I wish there was no disease or illness in the world. I wish everyone would be happy. I wish there would be no poverty. I wish there would be no one dying of hunger or thirst.   BUT if all this were to happen, the world will not be the place it is now! It will be very dull with no challenges. It will be too perfect for humans. There would be nothing to work towards or work for. So I guess deep down, I would rather everything be just the way it is now!!!

Spiderman- I would'nt want to have some sticking spider web thing coming out of my wrist. What if I get entangled in it myself? Too risky.  Batman- I would never in any life time want to have two black horn like things sticking out of my head (even though i would definely not mind riding a cool convertable like automobile just like he does :) )  Robin- Who would in the right mind would wnat to play second fiddle to another superhero.  Captain Planet- The same reason why I did not die to join Green Link in NJC hahaha you know what i mean :)   Power Rangers- I don't think its fun fighting Robots  ALL IN ALL i Would rather just be myself!!!! hahaha no Super Heros for me.. what abt you?

      E= emulate the best X= eXrteme stress A= An Apple to keep the doctor away M= Mother's constant nagging S= Sleeplessness and late nights  I do not believed that Examinations truly bring out the true intelligence of a person. I mean when you think about it, a good examination result does not reflect much other than the fact that the person has been hardworking and was with a clear, confident, mind when he or she attempted the paper.   People thrive to do well in examinations to prove to others and themselves that they are indeed intelligent and capable and hence they try to emulate the best in the field. Examinations cause much stress in some students due to the intense pressure burdened upon them by their family and teachers. Exams are NOT only about studying. Its also about being fit and healthy while writing the exam. Then there is the constant nagging of your mother in the background telling you to stop watching so much soccer and movies on TV and start studying (hahaha that happens to me a lot). Then as the exams near, the urgency increases and students start to burn midnight oil. hahaha then as the next exam nears, this whole thing repeats all over again!!  Well on the brighter side of things.. Imagine... so far(up to JC 2) you have taken over 44 exams and still counting..Its true that its indeed a whole lot but you are more than half way through your education and all these exams will be no more in just a few years!!

      I come from an all girls primary and secondary school. There the word EGO did not make such an impact as it has in JC. It has got all to do with the guys..hahahah LOL.. come on think about it girls generally do NOT have an over busting ego that seems to spill all over the place.. ok some of you would call me a feminist..but seriously only guys seem to be egoistic..There is this thing in them telling them that they should be better than others and that they should not lose to a girl and that they are the best and everything that others do is not that great after all etc etc hahah ok let me give some credit.. not all guys are like that of course ( I do know some guys who are just damn nice).  But on the other hand.. I think everyone should have a fair amount of ego but it should not reflect a great deal on your character..I mean you should have enough self esteem and self confidence but not go over board with it.. I guess it's hard to draw the line it just comes naturally...

      It was damn funny!!!! hahah I didn't think anyone would actually cross dress and parade in front of the school during the school celebrations! And especially when "you know who" is the judge of the fashion parade. HAHAHA I bet they got into trouble. Ok I sound sadistic like I want them to get into trouble or something - pardon me for that!  But whatever it is, it was funny! hahah I never understood why people would want to cross dress (Here I'm talking about people who do it for a living). I mean you have to be proud of who you are and what you are. I mean if your are not gay and just like any other person, why cross dress?  But on the other hand, it weird how society accepts girls dressed in shirt, jeans etc but not boys dressed like girls. There is some sort of biasness here you have to agree. Ahhh.. It's society what do you expect..

      We selfish, egoistic humans frequently claim that we are the supreme beings of the world and and everything comes under our control. It's by time that we face the truth- the obvious reality. No matter how "supreme" we are as compared to the many animals and creatures living on this Earth, we have to accept that Mother Nature is the ultimate ruler of this world tht we call Earth.  Mother Nature frequently reminds us through her violent volcanic eruptions that express her anger and fury and her ground breaking earthquakes that convey her distress towards us. All these just question our continued existance here. We may one day also crease to live and inhabitat this world just as the dinosaurs did. We are probably just a small chapter in the might long history of the life of Mother Earth. Think about it.
