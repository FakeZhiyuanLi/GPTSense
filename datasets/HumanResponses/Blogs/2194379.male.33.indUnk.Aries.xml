       The following are three stories from south of Chicagoland regarding the  urlLink Socialist Equality Party 's Tom Mackaman's successful struggle to get on the ballot, and a slate of  urlLink Illinois Green Party  candidates' unsuccessful battle to do the same. The Illinois Democrats are pulling the same dirty tricks downstate that they're pulling against Nader in Chicago.     urlLink  Champaign, Illinois electoral board bars Green Party candidates World Socialist Web Site [USA]    ... By Jerry White, 10 July 2004  The Champaign County, Illinois electoral board voted July 6 to exclude the entire slate of Green Party candidates running for county-wide positions in the area, which is home to the 38,000-student campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  The undemocratic decision was the culmination of a sustained effort, particularly by state and local Democratic Party officials, to block the Green Party from gaining ballot access. This included efforts to disrupt petitioners, intimidate students who decided to run as Green Party candidates and use pseudo-legal measures to raise the number of signatures required to attain ballot status and challenge the signatures that were collected.  The Illinois Democrats are using similarly unscrupulous methods in an effort to bar from the ballot Tom Mackaman, the Socialist Equality Party’s state legislative candidate in the 103rd District. Geraldine Parr, the current treasurer and former chairperson of the Champaign County Democratic Party, has filed a series of patently false objections to signatures collected by SEP supporters in order to remove Mackaman from the ballot and prevent any challenge to the Democrat incumbent State Representative Naomi Jakobsson.      urlLink  Illinois county clerk’s findings vindicate SEP petitions World Socialist Web Site [USA]    ... The Champaign County Clerk on Friday issued a preliminary judgment on the objections filed by the Democratic Party against the petitions of Socialist Equality Party Illinois state legislative candidate Tom Mackaman ...  After comparing the signatures with voter registration rolls, County Clerk Mark Shelden threw out 478 of the Democrats’ objections and upheld only 174—a ratio of nearly three-to-one in favor of the SEP. Combined with the original 982 signatures not objected to, and the 71 objections conceded by the Democrats during the preliminary examination by his staff last week, Shelden’s recommendation would give Mackaman 1,547 signatures—far more than the 1,325 required to place him on the ballot in the November election.  In one case the Democrats objected to 17 out of 20 signatures on a single petition sheet. After the county clerk compared the information on the petition to the signers’ voter registration cards he ruled that 16 of the 17 were in fact valid registered voters.  Shelden’s findings show that the Democrats employed “shotgun” methods, in which hundreds of signatures were arbitrarily selected to challenge without ever investigating the registration rolls. This confirms that the entire objection process has been an exercise in political deception and intimidation aimed at keeping Mackaman and the SEP off the ballot and excluding any opposition to the Democrats’ pro-war and pro-big-business policies.      urlLink  DEMS withdraw petition protest Urbana/Champaign News-Gazette - Champaign/Urbana,IL,USA    ... you go through an experience like this you realize the ballot access laws in ... graduate student and lecturer in history at the University of Illinois, called the ...  URBANA – The attorney representing Democratic objections to a Socialist Equality Party candidate in the 103rd House District has withdrawn those objections.  Champaign County Clerk Mark Shelden confirmed that objections to the candidate's petitions were officially withdrawn at 4:45 p.m. Thursday, allowing Tom Mackaman a place on the ballot against Democratic incumbent Naomi Jakobsson of Urbana and Republican candidate Deb Feinen of Champaign.  The action ends a month of conflict between the Socialist Equality Party and the Democrats that began June 22, the day after Mackaman filed 2,003 signatures to get on the ballot.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * * * *  The motion to withdraw the objections states that it was made "based on information received by the objector after she filed her petition."  According to a Socialist Equality Party statement released Friday, "This only confirms what the SEP has said all along: the Democrats arbitrarily selected hundreds of voters to disqualify, without bothering to check whether or not they were registered."  Andrew Spiegel, the attorney representing SEP, said, "Every time you go through an experience like this you realize the ballot access laws in the U.S. must change. The American people are supposed to choose who represents them, but they can't if the power brokers keep their choices off the ballot."

       From today's  urlLink Illinois Leader  ... Wait. First, I know what you might be asking. "Why would a conservative cyber-rag like the Leader cover a story on a bunch of Nader socialists trying to get on the ballot?" Well, generally, with all of the scandals going on in the Illinois Republican Party today, I'm sure they're glad for a legitimate reason to point at the Democrats and say, "Yeah, but look what  they're  doing!"  More directly, however, the gentleman who wrote this story, Cal Skinner, has seen up close the shameful stuff that goes on around election time, and he is a good friend to the cause of ballot access in Illinois. Cal faced some nasty tactics during a Republican Primary for state Rep. in ... 1998? ... then again when he ran for Governor on the Libertarian ticket in 2002. Cal's too socially conservative for me personally, but on this particular issue, I'm very glad he's around.  Now, on with the excerpt ...      Nader campaign denied access to state employee time sheets     Wednesday, July 28, 2004  By The Leader-Chicago Bureau   CHICAGO -- Charged with possible violation of state laws prohibiting use of state employees to do political work, House Speaker Mike Madigan (D-Chicago) refuses to provide state employee time sheets to the Nader for President campaign.   Nader's campaign alleges state workers were used to challenge signatures on their presidential candidate's petition for placement on the November ballot. The campaign filed a freedom of information request to obtain documentation, but was denied.  &ldquo;I am quite confident that a law suit would win here,&rdquo; said Chicago election law expert Richard Means this week. “If the legislature thought is was important enough to specify how the time sheets should be kept and that they should be kept by a fiscal officer, they clearly intended that they should be available for public inspection. If only their bosses could inspect them, then they wouldn’t need to be filed with the fiscal officers. They could just be kept by their employers.”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * * * *    Yours truly in the foreground, at the Chicago Board of Elections. Next to the right is an Elections Board Clerk, and last is House Democrat contractual employee Joseph Garcia. Joe was there almost every day. Was any of that time "on the clock," while Joe was being paid by the taxpayers of Illinois?   “The ‘sign-in sheets’ you have requested, to the extent they exist, comprise the personnel files that are maintained with respect to each employee,” House Clerk Mahoney wrote in both letters. “Your request is denied,” he said, citing two sections of the Freedom of Information Act and court cases from 1990 and 1997 which suggest that the personnel files are not public information.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * * * *  “The answer is that they are clearly wrong because time sheets are no longer in personnel files,” election attorney Means said. “They are in the fiscal officer’s files and they are intended to be public. There was discussion on the House and Senate floor about this.”    State law says, “State employees shall not intentionally perform any prohibited political activity during any compensated time.” Such “prohibited political activity” is defined to include “reviewing” petitions.   The Election Interference Act, passed decades ago when the legislature first noticed school districts using tax funds to advance their referendums, says, “No funds shall be used to urge and elector or vote for or against any candidate or proposition, or be appropriated for political or campaign purposes to any candidate or political organization.”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * * * *   &copy; 2004 IllinoisLeader.com -- all rights reserved

        urlLink from Kansas City infoZine  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Republican   efforts to get  Nader  on the ballot may be selfish and hypocritical, but these efforts do enhance the ability of voters to vote freely for the candidate of their choice. On the other hand, Democratic efforts to keep Nader's name off the ballot do interfere with voting rights.  ... The Democratic Party has tried to prevent voters from voting for certain minor party and independent presidential candidates in the past. [Progressive Party candidate and former vice president]  Henry Wallace  was kept off the Illinois and Oklahoma ballots in 1948 through Democratic Party efforts.  Eugene McCarthy  was kept off the New York ballot in 1976 by a Democratic Party challenge, and the Democratic National Committee intervened in legal proceedings in 1980 to try to keep John Anderson off the Massachusetts and North Carolina ballots.  ... This type of activity is virtually unknown in other advanced democracies. In Canada, the Liberal Party might be helped if it could keep the New Democratic Party off the ballot. And in Great Britain, the Labor Party might similarly be advantaged if it could keep the Liberal Democratic Party off the ballot. But that doesn't happen in those countries; it would be considered unspeakably unethical. Ballot access in both Canada and Great Britain is very easy. Candidates for House of Commons in Britain only need 10 signatures plus a filing fee, and Canada is similar.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~  Richard Winger ,  urlLink Ballot Access News   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * * * *  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Restrictions   on ballot access have historically increased after third parties have had successes. Pennsylvania, for example, quadrupled its signature requirement shortly after  George C. Wallace  garnered nearly 10 million votes as a third-party candidate in 1968.  ... During the Great Depression in the 1930s, when Socialists were seen as a viable alternative, a number of states increased their signature requirements to restrict access to the ballot. Prior to the 1890s, political parties were free to print and distribute their own ballots and, consequently, minor parties throughout most of the 19th century weren't faced with the kinds of discriminatory and burdensome ballot access laws that they encounter today.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~  Darcy Richardson , author of  urlLink  Others: Third-Party Politics From the Nation's Founding to the Rise and Fall of the Greenback-Labor Party   and forthcoming volumes in a four-volume work on third parties, the second of which will be released in October 2004.

        Received something interesting in my Inbox today from a visitor to  urlLink my main blog . Seems a lot of folks are stumbling onto my main blog today looking for references to or the text of  urlLink Barack Obama's speech  at the massive circle-jerk known as the Democratic Convention.   By the way, Jeff Trigg has Obama's speech along with some great commentary on  urlLink his blog .   My guess is that  urlLink Mr. Bill Caspers  is one of those Dem-bloggers who shills for the Party and never admits an original thought to cut through the Party noise.  Not to single out Democrats. Republican bloggers do the same thing. Theirs is a party-line groupthink sort of blogging that goes against the spirit of the Blog, and cheapens blogging for the rest of us. Here is Mr. Casper's e-mail to me, followed by my response:        Voting for Nader and don't like Bush?  ... or, do you simply not like Bush?   How about you give the power of free speech a try and consider signing up in our vote swapping campaign!   urlLink     Nader doesn't have to "spoil" the election in 2004, like what clearly happened with Florida in 2000. Try the new vote swapping system at www.DefeatBushAgain.com, which has been set up to provide Nader voters in key battleground states with the means to "swap votes" with Kerry voters in non-battleground states. You can also support the project by either donating to its cause or by buying or downloading and displaying one of several available bumper stickers!  Visit the project's site, learn about the system it developed, and try it out!    Mr. Caspers,  I hate Bush as much as the next intelligent, non-Bible thumping person, but your statement "Nader doesn't have to "spoil" the election in 2004, like what clearly happened with Florida in 2000" is just party-line bullshit.  According to the exit poll numbers, two thirds of those who voted for Nader in 2000 would otherwise not have voted and 10 times as many registered Democrats voted for Bush as voted for Nader. (that info is  urlLink from the Nader people , but if you can disprove it, please enlighten me.)  Also, via the  urlLink Green Party web site  (again, prove me wrong if you have the proof), "Al From, chair of the Democratic Leadership Council, wrote in Blueprint Magazine (1-24-01) that according to their own exit polls, Bush would have beat Gore by one percentage point if Nader hadn’t run in 2000."  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * * * *  Unlike Kerry and Democrats like yourself, I have principles and a conscience, and I will not compromise. If I change my mind at some point, and want to join the One Party With Two Heads just to feel like a "winner," I'll let you know.  Jeffrey Babbitt Chicago, IL Check my head at    PS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll be voting for  urlLink Libertarian candidate Michael Badnarik  in November. I support Nader's access to the ballot, but disagree with many parts of his platform.

        A few relevant sections follow from  urlLink a recent New York Times story . The Democratic John Kerry campaign is attempting to define itself as a champion of the downtrodden (including mainly poor, urban minorities) who are disenfranchised by the system. Among other things, Democratic lawyers in some states argue that a person's ID should not have to match exactly what appears in the state's database.  Hmm. Sounds an awful lot like the argument the Nader petition defense team is making here in Illinois. Only  here , the Democrats don't hesitate to negate the voice of the voters because of discrepancies between the government database and what's written on the petition. The kicker is that many of the signatures that may end up being completely discounted belong to poor, undereducated, urban minorities &mdash; the same "downtrodden" people Kerry and the Democrats pretend to champion.  When it comes down to it, the truth is that the Democrats (and the Republicans for that matter) only care about getting themselves into office.       New York Times    Kerry Building Legal Network for Vote Fights   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER Published: July 19, 2004  Mindful of the election problems in Florida four years ago, aides to Senator John Kerry, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, say his campaign is putting together a far more intricate set of legal safeguards than any presidential candidate before him to monitor the election.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*****  "A million African-Americans disenfranchised in the last election," he said at the N.A.A.C.P. convention in Philadelphia on Thursday. "Well, we're not just going to sit there and wait for it to happen." ...   [Comment: Instead, at least in Chicago, the Dems will make sure these people are disenfranchised well  before  the election.]   "...On Election Day in your cities, my campaign will provide teams of election observers and lawyers to monitor elections, and we will enforce the law."  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*****  Democrats say they learned from the Florida vote, and from the Supreme Court rulings that arose from it, that the most important legal battles are those fought before Election Day, over how election laws are to be carried out, who is allowed to register and who will be allowed to vote.   [Comment: In Chicago, Dems learned to manipulate the vote years ago. The skills and knowledge were passed down through the generations by crooks and party hacks like Mayor Dick Daley's father Richard J. "Boss" Daley.]    Robert Bauer, a partner of Mr. Elias's who is overseeing the Kerry legal effort, took a historical view of what he called "warfare over the electoral franchise." The first phase, he said, concerned who was entitled to vote and included the all-white primary, literacy tests and poll taxes that were eliminated in the mid-20th century. The second phase was fought largely over the dilution of the vote along racial lines and used the Voting Rights Act, he said.  "Now, we're into a third phase, that was exemplified by Bush-Gore, of franchise restrictions that are accomplished through manipulations of the elections administration process or of the law," Mr. Bauer said. "It's about people who somehow can't register, or can't vote, or their vote isn't counted, and it's done not frontally, but through legal manipulations."  Those can include the seemingly picayune. In Minnesota, a lawyer for the Kerry campaign is protesting a ruling by the secretary of state — Mary Kiffmeyer, a Republican — that every registrant must provide identification that matches "with certainty" a state database containing registered voters' names, birthdates and driver's license numbers or partial Social Security numbers. "It doesn't take into account a transposition of a number by a data-entry person," said Jim Rubenstein, the Kerry lawyer in Minneapolis. In an interview, Ms. Kiffmeyer said local officials would have the discretion to overlook an obvious typographical error.   [Comment: But this sort of "unfairness" is only unacceptable when it reduces the Kerry vote. If this were all based on principle, the Illinois Democrats would have been pulled off the Nader petition challenge by now.]   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*****

        I was going to post something about the substantial media coverage that last week's Free and Equal Election Coalition news conference received.

        As is mentioned in  urlLink the previous post , the Nader petition defense team filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with Illinois Speaker of the House, state Democratic Party chairman, and notorious Chicago gangster  (OK, that last part is unsubstantiated, and would not hold up in court, but I'm leaving it in, with this disclaimer)   urlLink Michael Madigan . We requested the time sheets, which would prove definitively whether the state employees working to keep Nader off the ballot in Illinois were there illegally on state time. Madigan has officially refused to provide the time sheets, claiming that they are part of the personnel files and therefore not subject to FOIA requests. It's a tenuous argument. The  real  point here is that there is no other way he can clear his people of these charges, just as there is no other way we can "convict" them.  I thought I'd take this opportunity to revisit a similar case from 1998, in which the Illinois Republicans were proved guilty of the same charges, thanks to the time sheets provided in response to a FOIA request from the  Chicago Tribune .        Chicago Tribune  Nov. 8, 1998    Time sheets back campaign charge    Ryan's office cited in complaint  by Cornelia Grumman    One of George Ryan's final stops in his election campaign was at his North Riverside campaign office to thank his hardest-core campaign volunteers.  Among the dozens of workers who busied themselves making get-out-the-vote calls, distributing signs and noshing on leftover Halloween cookies in cramped quarters was John Passero, who manages three facilities in Ryan's secretary of state's office.  &ldquo;I'm a full-time volunteer,&rdquo; said Passero, beaming as his mother and 8-year-old son posed with Ryan for photos. Passero added that his full-time dedication to the campaign started before the 4 th  of July, though in a phone interview weeks earlier, he said he was at work every day.  Problem is, Passero also is a full-time state worker who drew full-time state checks during the campaign.  Illinois law prohibits working on campaigns while on the taxpayer's dime, but the mandate is difficult to enforce and each election features accusation of office shenanigans and employee violations.  Rarely, though, is anyone caught or reprimanded, mostly because it's difficult and time-consuming to prove. The offense is considered a misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail for a first offense.  Officials from the Illinois Libertarian Party, whose slate was knocked off the ballot shortly before Tuesday's vote, have asserted in documents filed with the Illinois Board of Elections that state employees, including many from Ryan's office, worked on the nominating petition challenge on state time.  A check of sign-in sheets at the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners as well as a review of state employee time records and interviews appear to support their charges. At least 73 state employees worked on the petition challenge during August and the first week of September, records show, with more than half employed by the secretary of state.  Of the nearly 180 visits made by state workers to the boards offices to work on the challenge, at least 19 were made by employees who were on the state clock, records show. The other visits appear to have been made either after hours or on personal time.  The number of state employees working on state time may well be higher. While a dozen other state agencies complied with Freedom of Information requests for employee schedulesfiled a month ago, Ryan's office declined to turn over all records for all secretary of state employees.  &ldquo;I was there,&rdquo; Passero said last month of his working at the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners to knock the Libertarians off the ballot. &ldquo;You had to have people on both sides, so I volunteered to help on my own time.&rdquo;  But Passero's work records show that on two of the 7 days he worked on the petition challenge&mdash; Aug. 7 and Aug. 29&mdash; he did not take time off.  Ellouise Pullum, a field administrator with the secretary of state's office, signed in to do campaign work at 12:48 p.m. Aug. 31, even though she was also listed as having worked a full day at her government job.  Pullum said last week that she had no comment.  One secretary of state employee who worked on the Libertarian challenge said she only performed those duties after leaving work at 4:30 p.m. Records show, however, that she stamped into the election board offices at 3:39 p.m. one day and at 4:19 p.m. on another.  Some state employees who logged in responded that they merely used their lunch break or stopped by to drop off a sandwich for a friend. But a state election board hearing examibner said that, because all sides had to work together in teams in late August, it was rare that anyone could drop in for short spells.  &ldquo;We worked in the same teams for most of the day, and sometimes half a day,&rdquo; said a state board of elections hearing examiner, who asked not to be named. &ldquo;But it wasn't like you could just drop in for an hour and leave, or help out for 15 minutes.&rdquo;

         &nbsp;Coalition Asks Madigan to Explain Political Use of State Employees   (Chicago, IL) ― Supporters of independent candidate Ralph Nader for President held a joint press conference today on the status of the Illinois Democratic Party’s attempt to kick Nader off the ballot. Members of the Free and Equal Elections Coalition (FEEC) also presented evidence showing state employees from the legislative staff of Illinois Democrats in the state House of Representatives are working on the challenge.   “We may not agree on other policies, but we are unifying against these ridiculous ballot access laws in Illinois,” says Jeff Trigg, Libertarian Party of Illinois Executive Director. “The facts are that Illinois Democrats are challenging Nader, but they bent over backwards to let President Bush blatantly ignore deadlines in election law. This Bush favoritism shows you who the Democrats think their political enemies are, and it isn't the Republicans. Their enemy is voter choice, and that is wrong,” adds Trigg.   In addition to their attempts to kick Ralph Nader off the ballot, the Illinois Democratic Party has challenged the petitions of the Green Party Presidential and US Senate candidates, along with Green Party candidates for county positions in Champaign County, and a Socialist Equality Party candidate for State Representative in the Champaign area. Democrats have also been responsible for removing Green candidates in previous years.   In 1998, George Ryan and the Republicans removed the Libertarian candidates for state Constitutional offices while using more than 70 Secretary of State employees on the petition challenge, several of whom were working on the state’s clock. In 2002, Republicans tried again to deny voters’ rights, but lost their challenge. Illinois Republican Party Chair and State Treasurer Judy Baar Topinka is now under a federal grand jury investigation for allegedly sending her Treasurer office employees to work on that petition challenge.   “We’ve already identified no less than 10 Democrat state employees working on this challenge, most coming directly from Speaker Michael Madigan’s staff,” states Christina Tobin, a local coordinator for the Nader for President campaign. “I’ve requested the relevant payroll records to verify these state employees are not on the clock, but Madigan’s staff is acting like they’ve got something to hide. If that isn’t enough, Madigan is sending over his 16 year old interns that have no business being put into the middle of this legal process.”   “In light of all this information,” Tobin concludes, “we call on Mike Madigan to explain why state employees worked on the objections to Mr. Nader’s petitions, and if these employees were on taxpayers’ dollars while impeding democracy.”   The Free and Equal Elections Coalition includes Independents and members of the Green Party, Socialist Equality Party, International Socialist Organization and Libertarian Party, working together for ballot access in Illinois.   ###

        Illinois Leader  Thursday, June 05, 2003   urlLink   ILGOP ignored whistleblower      CHICAGO  &mdash; Today the  Tribune  is carrying a story about whistleblower  Cathy Lynne Santos , who was subpoenaed in February by the feds concerning allegations that the  State Treasurer's  office used state workers to do campaign work on state time.  Not only is  Judy Baar Topinka  the state's treasurer and the only  Republican  holding statewide office these days in Illinois, she is the chairman of the  Illinois Republican Party .  Santos, who co-founded a Republican grassroots organization called  Republican Young Professionals  (based in Chicago), tried to warn the Republican Party about concerns she had while working under contract for the treasurer's office. The party told her to put her concerns in writing.  Santos prepared an affidavit on November 23rd last year telling what she knew of  Judy Baar-Topinka’s  use of state workers for campaign purposes.  Santos then distributed the affidavit to members of the party's state central committee, but they ignored her concerns and chose Topinka to head the party.  Santos, a contractual employee of Topinka, reported in the affidavit what she witnessed on June 28, 2002. The  Illinois Leader  obtained an unsigned copy of the Santos affidavit which was circulated to the committee last winter.  &ldquo;I arrived at the Treasurer’s Office to tie up loose ends, finish my final reports and say my goodbyes to the staff, as it was the last day of my contract,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;I soon realized that the majority of the employees were not in the office.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Upon inquiry, the switchboard operator told me that something was going on, as no one came into work that morning,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;Before lunch that day, a call was transferred to my desk and the caller identified himself as [name withheld for purposes of this affidavit] with Channel 7 and was calling to substantiate a tip he had received that employees from the Treasurer’s Office were at the Illinois Board of Elections working on a petition challenge during normal business hours.&rdquo;   Santos alleges Topinka's state employees challenged candidate petitions on state time   The petitions being challenged on the day Santos refers to in her affidavit were the Libertarian Party's, at the time headed by gubernatorial candidate  Cal Skinner , former 16-year Republican state representative from Crystal Lake.  The Illinois Republican Party was challenging the candidate petitions. Topinka was not the party chairman at the time,  State Representative Lee Daniels (R-Elmhurst)  was.  &ldquo;Late that same afternoon several employees that were absent all day came back to the Treasurer’s office, I asked more than one individual where they had been, and was told that specific employees had been directed by Nancy Kimme to go to the Board of Elections and assist with the petition challenge to get the Libertarian candidate off the ballot for the General Election,&rdquo; Santos explained.  At the time,  Nancy Kimme  was Topinka's campaign manager.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * * * *   &copy; 2003,  Illinois Leader
