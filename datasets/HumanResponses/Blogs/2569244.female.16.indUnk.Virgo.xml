      well i wrote this long elaborate entry this morning and then i went to publish it and it screws up...all my thoughtful words...gone gone gone! so yeah that made me sad. but basically what it said was that i got to see jesse today and it made me feel really happy bcuz i missed him so much...then i got sad bcuz he was just about to leave and i was like..i don't know when i get to see you...and then we had this serious talk...and it was quite depressing bcuz it was about his desire to attend the naval college in annapolis, maryland. which is..like on the other side of here. =( but i'm not suppose to think about it. it just sucks that he'd be gone for 8 years but i'd get to visit him once a year. but he's not even supposed to have a girlfriend bcuz he can't be commited...so i wondered what the point was...and that's when he kissed me...i love the guy to death and he loves me...it's just...college will be the death of me. i hate being alone...i find myself alone this holiday break and i can't seem to think of good times. but i feel really good that i got to see jesse...and it especially helps bcuz i won't be able to see him tonight. hmm but yeah that naval thing is a toughy...do i tell him to see each other people while he's away so i'm not tied down too? NO BCUZ THAT SUCKS! i really just want him...he's everything i want...but it makes sense why high school relationships don't work that much...bcuz it's college that screws them over. they move on...i don't know if i can...i don't want to move on..i've worked so hard and shed so many tears i can't bare it one more time. he says he's happy where we are right now and i agree. it's perfect...he has time with his friends and me. i know school will be better...i can't be clingy but knowing he's within the grasp of my hand is somewhat comforting...well enough about this...next subject! hmm i guess i'm not too prepared for this....must improvise...hehe...i painted my nails today and they look awesome...i'm gonna try to keep them for school so people can remember how cool i am. lol. i long for monday...i even want to go to sectionals!! lol. hmm maybe i should make some cookies for them and be like...here is some poison..i mean...cookies...lol...aww i miss them...ah who am i kidding i miss everyone! but it's cool bcuz i might get to see tiff and elisa tomorrow at like 5(pm) and just hang out. it's cool bcuz we never get to hang out anymore since we go to different schools...we have different lives practically...different drama...and it's hard...and here i am complaining about this...imagine when jesse is....AHHH not thinking about that!!! but it's working so far. we still talk just not that much. but i miss my el cap buddies so much. i love them all. oo which reminds me...my fan club...it is growing...i have 6 members..TAKE THAT CAMERON! i only have to get 495394750273653 more people and then i'll catch up with him. lol...i remember when i use to be cool...and people thought i was great...it's fun being on the top! not to be taken sexually...lol. hmm i think my new year's resolution(s) are to be more organized, do better in history and chemistry(like actually reading the damn chapters) and definitely to be a better friend and not just think about me. not make things about me. and also i wanna control my temper...esp for stupid reasons...lol. well this is fun...hmm..i want to watch bruce almighty...but that movie is sad..."i just want her to be happy" OMG!!! jim carrey is hot..lol. and soo funny..also a great quality. lol hmm well this is not an exact replica of the one i made this morning..but it's better in the sense that it doesn't make me look as confused and pathetic...and i hate looking weak so there. but i've already blown that cover...I THOUGHT I HAD STOPPED CRYING!! damn the male race! lol. wait..is that a race? hmmm...well i think the females won. gosh i keep being off topic..but that's just what's so fun about this...trying to understand what i'm talking about. haha. well then i think i am off now (i never know how to end these damn things...) hmmm i'll think of something...ahh! i have to bring toys for these damned kids now...jeez..why don't i bring the kids too! well they aren't using anything of mine...i hate having my stuff being tortured in the hands of little ones...yeah...that's kinda rude and such but ahh i hate it...all my hard work to keep stuff in good condition...ruined!! so yeah...i'll bring some cards...hell i'll bring a tv...just watch movies forever. now that's the easy way to do it...gosh i don't even know who the heck i'm babysitting! how am i supposed to bring stuff to accomodate their needs? hmmm..ok i'm done writing about nothing...lol. we shall see how the night goes....believe me...you'll hear about it...*eye twitches*...let the games commence!

      I really don't wanna be alone tomorrow night...but it seems i have no choice bcuz i am destined to be lonely and the fact that jesse isn't a girl...i don't know...i just had a hard time today...i went shopping and i didn't get anything! can you even call it shopping? hmm more like browsing...iono...i don't know...i get mad sometimes...like i wonder if jesse does actually like me for me and actually cares about the person i am. or is it just a misconception bcuz they can't see me for who i am, distracted by the outside? i just don't want to be someone that they love for the wrong reasons.. ok maybe that is just the lonliness talking...hmm...and for some strange reason i really miss cameron...haha...i miss talking to him and laughing...but at the same time i love jesse and miss him just as much...guys need to stop being so damned confusing...wait a second..i think i'm the one who is being confusing....damn... i think the last time i truly had fun was on christmas with jesse when we played snakes and ladders and checkers...and of course when he tickles me. =) that was actual pure fun. haha...you know what's funny? my title sounds like a headline. lol. ok i am having fun now...yes...yes i am...well i got bummed out bcuz yesterday jesse didn't call me and i hadn't talked to him forever and i was just all mad that nothing was going right and ahhh. hmmmmm...what to say...ah yes. tutoring didn't go too horribly but man does she waste time...i was like...let's just get this done..and then she'd take a marker and a pad of paper and then i guess she was trying to make sense out of it and it seemed like she was the one teaching me! ahh. she was like adding on like a fractional problem where you were supposed to get a common denominator. hmm..i wonder if i'm really cut out to be a teacher. i can't keep my own flute section together with only 8 people how am i supposed to teach a class of like 30? i must learn! I'LL SHOW YOU! muahaha! umm right..sorry..but the problem with my section is that i try to be their friend and not their section leader...i hate being the bad guy. oh well sooner or later i must learn and serve my classroom JUSTICE!

      hmmm...i feel empty...i really miss jesse and i fear it will be too long until i see him again. i hate when he gets all excited only to be shut down with my bad news. he wanted me to be with him new year's and i already made plans to babysit on new years....keep in mind i made these plans when i wasn't going out with him...but that's a whole different story..let's just take it one story at a time. =)...anyways...he was saying how his mom was asking if i was coming over and he was like oh freak yeah! and that she was thinking about me spending the night too...so yeah it sucked majorly when i had to tell him i already made plans. but it wasn't the first time i told him...i told him before and he seemed only to care about the money i'd be making. ever since he's gotten a job he only really cares about money and he's becoming a real workaholic but whatever i will always support him...he's just one of those people that have to work for their money and i am really impressed at his dedication=)...i want to be like that where i don't have to ask for money all the time so i really need the money...but i really need to see him too...oh well. i guess i just have to wait another year to be kissed at midnight...prob my biggest fantasy ever. since like 8th grade...maybe sooner i can't be too sure. so yeah it turns out that he fantasizes that real bad too. ahhh i can't please everyone and it makes me frustrated. oh and to make things worse...i have to go to my grandma's today and help my cousin with her math ...(you're looking at a math queen..yay!) and i am getting paid but damn...cuz that ruins tomorrow's plan of jesse coming over. i just wanna be with him and talk and laugh with him. i haven't seen him since christmas...and even though it was great  that day since we saw lord of the rings...i just wish time was on my side. i don't know...well i also have loads of homework that i have to tackle someday before the break is over...and i just feel too lazy to do it..haha. and just when this looks complicated...it gets even worse...i feel really worried that i don't really know my friends...and i emailed one of them an elaborate letter and i was practically crying when i wrote it and she didn't even seem afflicted by it or say anything about it. i hate it...i'm jealous that some other friend is more of a friend to her. omg...it's a miracle...my phone has been found...it's been lost since november 14th. turns out is was under my bed...who knows if i'll ever get that back...we shall see. my stepdad was a real jerk...my parents always seem to unknowingly kick me when i'm down. i can't blame them but damn it sucks. i hate not being able to do things...iono if you understand that but i know what i'm talking about so there! i always try to make people smile except when i'm in moods like these...i love seeing people smile and so yeah...i like to smile too. weee...well i think this is all for now. until next time i see you..i love you jesse

      yes...we laugh and we have a good time...but what we have in common is limited. we talk about perverted things and that's our main topic. i can't do that all the time...but there are those times..when you are just so sweet and you make me feel so good...and i'm glad i have a friend in you. but that's all it should be...i know i sometimes lead you to believe certain things..and it's so rude...i don't deserve you...nor do i love you...and i can't reason with myself why i would need to when there is someone else...someone who i have a lot in common with...someone who loves me in breath and not in just words. he who has cared for me since as far as i can remember and this is who i must decide. his talent, his brains, his humor, the muscles...what's not to love? those eyes i have gazed into many a time...i look up to him. his maturity...he makes me want to be a better person...and i can't help but love him...with every beat of my heart. i've grown and i've seen my ways...i need to act more responsible and think of the future. i know i may not have him forever...but...the time with him will be worth it...i'd rather try and fail with him than never try and move on...always wondering whether or not it would work out. when do you call it quits? i don't...i will never give up on us. i know he is special...i don't know whether it's because he's my first love..but there's something there....i can feel it. i never once thought when he and i would break up, it just happened so many times....but...i always think with others...how long it would last..and not wanting to hurt them...and every time i have gone out with him...i never think, oh we're just gonna break up again....never. i just enjoy the time i have with him...and i love him. i want to keep him. he's not bad to me...i'm bad to us..i let this happen..he's just watching me and getting mad that i haven't fixed it yet...i will...i will....he's everything...from the time i first saw him, from our hardships...till now...our love has grown and i wish it to continue. we'll live each day by day...our words of anger...sure they hurt us...we just needed some time together...some time to talk about things..i know i would regret giving him up...it would be the dumbest thing i could do..when these problems are so simple to fix...he cares for me, and he's so sweet...i love everything about him..these couple weeks have thrown me off..but i figure we can only go up from here......i choose him...

      the situation- i'm stuck. well not really...but it has a dramatic effect in saying that...gosh i am so lost..i don't know what i'm doing anymore. i have a temper problem....and i admit i handle them wrong...i need a lot of growing up...and i need to do it fast. i hate who i am..and how i live. and i hate how i can't change...i want to...and i try to..but i just can't make the transition. i don't know...maybe it's my unwillingness to want to grow up...that is why i can act all immature...sometimes...i'm a lot more grown up than i was as a freshman..but i'm still in my sophmore year mentally. i wanna be perfect for you...and it's hard. you tell me how...and i can't retain it. i love everything about you...how you make me laugh..and feel...how you care for me...and now the future lies in my hands...it's up to me...no matter how long i hold on..you have to hold on too...and i'm never gonna let go....and this is where it gets complicating...i'm a bitch. i want all guys to like me...and only one to have me...i'm a tease...and the one person i want is you...and somehow i keep screwing it up for us..we're digging two separate holes and as we both dig...we keep shoveling the dirt in each other's hole...getting us no where..but nevertheless digging....and realizing that we're shoving dirt into each other's hole..angers us and we start doing it on purpose...enough figurative stuff..i'll write later...just need to get some off my chest...i've gone down to a A cup. lol.

      wow...am i ever tired! i spent the night at tiffany's for her birthday thing and it was fun. we stayed up way too late being goofy and such and although it was fun..it was definitely tiring. it sucks i have to wake up early tomorrow. ahh. but it'll be worth it. the people i love the most i swear will be closest. yesterday i got to drive around a lot...and i got to go to Harvest Ranch where that love of mine works and i surprised him..i looked really crappy so i hope i didn't embarrass him and make his coworkers think that he has bad taste. lol..but anyways...my mom bought some carne asada and some meatloaf from there and then he came over after work. and then we argued...i hate arguments but what can ya do. but this time i actually see my fault and admit that i'm not a great job...but it sucks...it's either my friend or him and i don't want either feelings to be hurt...i'm not a mean person! i can't just give someone the cold shoulder! and then he got only a tiny mad/sad bcuz i had a guy's phone number in my address book that i got from the summer...when i was single. so yeah. anyways...we had fun...we wrapped my present for tiff and we played foosball and we also had a tickle war...i love tickle wars! i so won it's not even funny. actually it was..bcuz he's so much stronger than me and yeah...but...i'm too quick...a ha! so we had a good 3 hours together before elisa's dad picked me up. aww i love that guy. omg! at her house...we tried to scare the 2 other girls and it consisted of running up to them telling them the zombies were gonna get us and me tripping and telling them to leave me behind. lol. gosh. then for her present, we combined them then we decided the bag was too big and we put a whole bunch of stuff from the kitchen and we were cracking up. then we talked and then segregated and then played cards. wow. we stayed up till four and then woke up at 9..i am regretting this as we speak. so yes...i am staying up waiting till 8:30 so me and jesse can talk. hehe. i was like...this isn't some 5 minute chat is it? and you're not gonna yell at me are ya? and he's like no this is just a chat of how much i love and miss you...or something really sweet like that that made me feel like....aww that's my jesse. hey speaking of him..yesterday we talked about marriage. and we had a pre proposal proposal. hehe...he asked me if i could ever see myself with him forever..and i was like...i think i could...i mean i always laugh with him and always ahve a good time. and then i was like...why could you with me? and he was like OF COURSE. (yes i was very excited about that one) and then we just stared at each other briefly and he was like..if we make it through high school, do you wanna marry me? hehe. i was like....yes! so yeah...i have something i can work up to. i would love to marry jesse...my high school sweetheart...i swear i have so much in common with him. i love everything about him..how he's so good with kids and everything. i can't wait...cuz baby...I DO!

      today is a happy day. why? bcuz of the wonderful flukes and the power of prayer. so yeah. i'm really happy. it's always nice to know that someone cares. yesterday i asked adi a favor of prayer and i thought she would think i was insane or something bcuz of how long it took to get a response...it prob seemed like forever bcuz i was just paranoid but i was glad she was there. i never really get to talk girly with girls. lol. i know that sounds funny but..it's true...i have always found it necessary to find a friend that you can talk about anything with. and it's been tough. all my friends i've ever been close to were tomboyish at one point...[thank God for change.] even though sometimes it amazes me at how much they have changed and i make outrageously loud comments like..."ADI! YOU'RE WEARING SANDALS!" [sorry adi]...i think the girliest friend i have is sarah...i was really happy to find her. when i went out with nick or when we use to talk about nick, we became really close...i remember i got to go to ehr house on a half day and we just talked about nick and watched a soap opera. omg. i haven't watched one of those in ages. i use to watch days of our lives with my sister when i was in like elementary school...and...well...they're fun. lol. i just love suspense and dramatic irony. wee. i know some people aren't happy that i am going out with jesse again...but...i'm happy. :D yesterday was quite interesting. i made a card for tiffany bcuz her bday is the 20th and i filled the front and back with random quotes. lol. tiff tiff is random. it's weird bcuz jesse's bday is the day after hers(21) and they're a lot alike. they both like the color orange and elephants...just a few strange things. maybe it's an aquarius thing. lol. but hmm..i stilll haven't gotten/made anything for jesse yet. i think i might make a poem, get like a gift certificate for blue meanie, and get him a green shirt and silky boxers. but i'm gonna have him go with me...for two reasons...to make sure he wants to wear the style of shirt and to make sure they fit. lol. weee. i'm glad i saw jesse after school all those times...bcuz i doubt i'm gonna see him this weekend..but i think it will be ok. yesterday he wanted to go to outback just the two of us and i really didn't feel in the mood for it...and plus my mom was gonna have to take us and she didn't come home till like 8:25 ish so it was good we didn't plan on it. and yesterday i found a cd my older brother burned for my mom and it has a lot of good songs that i like so i have been rockin out forever. lol...hmmm today i have to think of what i can possibly do for jesse...i think he needs some more posters for his room...or maybe i could just get him a new knife/sword thing for his collection..but iono if i wanna encourage the scariness. lol. tomorrow i get to go to tiff's house for the first time. i can hardly wait. i'm gonna get her some charms...cuz elisa is getting her the bracelet and a few charms. hmmmm. let's see..i should have enough money. aww and then of course my handsome nephew is gonna be two...aww i wanna see him so bad. and of course i wanna see my sis. she is the greatest. i must be lucky...wow i am always off topic..but wait...was there ever really a topic? *looks at title* D'OH!

      the one who has always been there when i needed him...the only one i would let need me...shutting everyone out bcuz of the issue..he's there. and boy do i need him right now. concerned? yes. life threatening? maybe...why do i keep this all inside...maybe i don't want people to think differently of me...i know they already do...but this is different...it comforts me when jesse tells me not to worry. when he says he'll stick by me no matter what....instances when some would just run away and never face the problem. but he is there till the end. i love that guy.

      yay! today i got to go to Jesse's house to study (no not the billy madison way) like a lot...and i got to practice driving today too...i drove to his house..after we had made 3895702720 errands...that really made me angry but hey..i was going on their time..so i'll deal with it..and so yeah..we studied a lot...not nearly enougb for me...tomorrow..is my death day of studying. and it sucks bcuz tomorrow i have sectionals until 4, and then an ortho appt at 4:45. ahhh!! hmmm...maybe i can cancel sectionals...no i can't do that...hmm...i'll just have to concentrate on those two subjects tomorrow...gosh this is real paranoia. ok maybe paranoia's sister or something..lol. but yeah...i really like the title. i mean..it's got me thinking...there are exceptions to everything in life...that's why love is the exception. and i can tell it too...when i look into his eyes...when we play our games...when he teaches me to head bang...when we reunite 7 times. maybe it's me....maybe i'm just naive and don't know any better...too lost in every word he says...his speech is so perfect...like his own language...the most pleasant to even the common man. how every syllable has it's own uniqueness. and when he looks at me...i can't breathe...when we kiss i could just cry...this isn't some little girl crush. this is actual love. not love that couples share to just get further into their relationship...or 3 words that people say just because they are a couple. when i say it i mean every single letter. it's forever. i will never think otherwise. it's too hard to, believe me i've tried. i know another exception to this title...forever is forever. HA! i ahve deeply thought about this and i will win!!! HA! well i can't be serious any more..i've been in a really good mood. even when i had to go home. i always feel good when i am with him...and when i know he really loves me...i can see in his eyes..that it's going to be different...i love you jesse. with all of my heart. in the world. mostest x's two!

      i fear that i have no true friends...they belong to each other and i to myself. their inner circle...one that orbits around me, laughing becuase they have such a great friendship and i am left as jesse's doll, where he runs both of our lives, forcing me where he goes. i must have the worst luck with friends. like in middle school...sure i had great friends...but i can't tell you how happy i was to move and leave them. it's fun to hear how much they miss me. i find myself missing them the most. but when the emptiness is filled by them i sadly get reminded of things...like when we go to the mall..the 3 of us...the other two will be talking up a storm and i find myself on the end wondering what they're talking about. all the people i have called friends have hurt me in some way..whether intentionally or physically....whether with lies, ditching, or some other heartbreaking pg 2 story. of course not important enough to go on page one. i want a friend who is my age and is just there for me. i want a friend i can just run off with and never look back...where i can give jesse his space and have some friend time. right now i just feel so excluded. maybe i brought myself to this point...who knows? maybe i am just supposed to be alone...forever and always. no one knows how i feel...no one invites me places...i have to ask to help them with something...so i'm good for a few math problems...i ahve no control...nor confidence to support...i fear my dream will never come true. i just need the weekend to run away...cuz i don't wanna think of misfortune any longer...

      god. i don't know. i believe in evolution...i mean...how can we all be inbred? but..how can we be from microscopic particles and slowly evolve ? i'm the most confused christian they get...i pray every night...but i sometimes deny my faith...whether fear that someone will make fun...or just bcuz i don't want them to know. but..why would the christian religion be the only one that's right? many other people believe in multiple gods or some other type of god. why is it that christian is almighty and the other ones are wrong? christianity isn't even the oldest religion...so how did adam and eve worship? certain questions liek these keep me from 100% belief. it wasn't always liek this...when i was first introduced to god. i learned that i had to ask him/her/it to be in my heart and forgive me of my sins. so i went home, cleaned out my closet and cried my heart out begging for him/her/it to be included in my life...to forgive me of all wrongdoings...for the horrible life i had and bad experiences. and so i became real into the religion...i was so excited when i got my bible. i could now read along with the pastor and everyone else with their bibles. and life was good. but what started the distance between us...is being alone every single sunday. no friend, no nothing...everyone went to some christian school..and i knew i didn't belong. i had one good friend...i can't remember her name but she and i talked...on rare ocassions when i would attend. then she just started becoming so cool and i just got so tired of being alone. see at the church i went to..it was organized by elementary, middle school, high school, and the adults. when i went to the high school building...i was so scared. a mere freshman in this sea of unfamiliar faces. i remember being there and i got sick because the pastor was talking about the free love days and this guy that died from AIDS...and it was so gruesome that i felt so icky that i lef the room bcuz i felt so weird. i don't think i have ever looked forward to church lately...unless a rare friend would attend...i couldn't even tell you the last time i went to church...oh..i remember...it was power house...the reflection time got to me...reflection time! ahhh..reflection of what? all my bad church memories!?!? all my years in solitude basically. another thing is probably that i hated the hours...my dad use to sing in the choir too...when my family seemed happy...when we'd come home and sing "let the walls fall down" just before my dad camped out on his beloved chair. and how my dad's parents would always preach to me and ask why we never went...i hate being alone!! and say it's not real...then what? we wasted our whole lives for some supernatural power? and if it is...we screw ourselves over for not believing and having doubts? it's quite perplexing. religion never really makes sense..and yet..i pray: now i lay me down to sleep i pray the lord my sould to keep if i shall die before i wake i pray the lord my sould to take and then sing a song i learned many a year ago in vacation bible school about not having to be a superman, then it's off to praying for people or whatever is on my mind, and then closing with the lord's prayer. so you see i am just in pieces over this topic. maybe one day i will rejoice and praise his name for making me choose him/her/it...or maybe someday i will just blame myself and fate. but then again...fate can be run through this same process....obviouisly i lack faith. gosh i hate me..

      so yeah melina stole my loverly title...so yeah i'm pressing charges...lol. anyways...and after reading that i must tell you....it's not jealousy...it's just people don't like seeing you guys do stuff...bcuz they are close to you and it's weird...that's why guys watch porn bcuz for one thing they're naked and having sex and the other thing is that they don't even know the people. so yeah...if you wanna like make out..go somewhere else...or don't complain...cuz you know people are gonna talk if you do crazy stuff...especially if it's in the view...like if you start making out right by the band door...it's like asking for attention...basically what i'm saying is that people don't wanna see that...and the reason people you hang out with don't mind other people is again back to that issue of us not knowing them or even looking over there in the first place. i know how you feel because that's how it was like my entire freshman year...and it would always be sooo freakin loud when we would try to kiss...but since we don't like go full force in front of people...no one says anything...or at least i don't think they do...omg i'm paranoid!! do they!?!?! lol. but yeah just laying it down for you mel...for your own good..not a diss just wanting to tell you...and oh! about that title!! it was soo great bcuz i saw that episode on the 7th!! how freakin awesome can it get? i mean seriously. lol.

today was really good for me. like jesse welcomed me with a very nice long kiss...it was great bcuz we haven't done much but pecked lately and i was missing his lips...(gosh i'm so open)...it kinda sucked only bcuz he was gone for most of lunch cuz he was playing and singing for his spanish teacher...hehe...his teacher was saying how beautiful it was and how lucky i am to have a guy who can sing and play...but she need not tell me...i knowed this! anyways...ben-judah is spending the night at jesse's so i'm kinda bummed at the fact that i won't get a call from him...but...oh well...sometimes i feel i am fighting for jesse's attention and time. but i know i can't think that way bcuz he needs to be with his friends...and it's cool...bcuz then i get to be with mine...like cameron! and what's up with people giving me weird looks when i ask where cameron is...HE'S JUST MY FRIEND...i mean...it's kidna weird that he loves me and all but he is really nice and such...lol.(cameron nice....in the same sentence...believe me i couldn't believe it either...you should see some of the things he writes) i can't think of any other way to explain it. some things i rather not have everyone know so i'm not including them ha! but back to jesse...it was great bcuz after school jesse spent like a whole 5 minutes with just me. it seems like nothing but it is a lot to me. but then some guy came up adn wanted to play his guitar then of course jesse had to bust out his skills and then chris g and ben-judah were all there and yeah so much for that...then we waited for my gpa and i stayed close to him...just holding him...you know..the casual PDA that is legal at this school. but anyways..another crummy thing is that i won't be able to see him on the 11th...our day i guess you could say. hehe it rhymes. because he's busy..i would love to...but i guess it just isn't going to happen...i still haven't told my parents that i am going out with him again...i don't want them to know...oh!! and my grandpa came to pick me up today...so i kissed jesse goodbye and it was in range of his vision and then i went to get in the car and he was like "i just saw some couple lay it on them and i thought it was you and then you came around the corner" it was a very close call i might say...very ironic bcuz it was me but...this will be our little secret ok? get it got it good? weee...

      well last night i typed up all the vocab for english and emailed it to jesse. he had to work and i said that i dont' work so i ahve time to give you the definitions then you won't be wasting what little time he has...he thought i was going to actually make the flashcards...heck no...but i told him i was just doing that and so i did and this morning he actually comes up to me with a big smile, picks me up, and swings me around..and then unknowingly kisses me on the lips..see we haven't been kissing since he had a cold sore and i quite frankly don't want herpes so we don't kiss when he has those or when we're sick..but sometimes we can't help the second one...it's only disease! not poisonous or anything..but yeah it was so cool...he was like..thank you so much lex it helped me so much. it made me feel really good. and i'm glad i did that instead of pointlessly studying for a history test today...which i ultimately failed. but anyways..i am needing to talk to adi...yessiree...but i can't speak of this on here...much too importante! but anyways..i had a god day today...during break i didn't spend it with jesse but with sarah and we mingled...and then when class was gonna start i went up to him and gave him a kiss and he was like..why didn't you spend that time with me? and i was like cuz i have to be with my friends too...i swear...when i wanna spend time with him, he pushes me away and when he wants that time with me i wanna just be with other people...i think it's good for us to grow though...but yeah...i have to stop doing this...i gotta do hmwk right away!!! not 2 hours later...jeez!!! alexis you are so horrible...

      well today was just a big reminder of what it's like when jesse is mad at me. but we got past it so that's all that matters...we both ahve things we need to work on so we will be stronger. i had to omit what happened bcuz i'm supposed to keep the things that go on between me and him just between me and him..although i like going to my friend's for advice..and sometimes i just don't wanna talk to him about it...but pretty soon i shan't fear him..until then..i'll practice....today my friend's dog got ran over...i feel so bad for her bcuz she's all sad now and there's just nothing i can do to bring her dog back...and this college thing is waving right in front of my face and i know i won't be able to grasp it...and i don't wanna go to a crummy school. well i need some time to do flashcards....damn you mccurry!

      I think this title is most appropriate for today's entry. it's from recess when spinelli and tj have to kiss in front of everyone at school to tell everyone in elementary that is closely watching if it is disgusting..th whole cootie thing here....but it's not that part that my entry is about...it's about the future...(gosh why do i feel like i'm writing an essay!!!) but anyways...i just got back my scores from the PSAT today....and it wasn't too great...so i'm really scared that i'm gonna wind up in a crappy college and won't be able to meet my goals. i want to become an algebra teacher and how can i accomplish this when i don't even have a great score!?!? i hate getting low scores on these tests to show smarts...not only do i get totally jealous...well...that's basically all that happens...i want to go to UCSD...and i'm just hoping that i can change my ways into the really high numbers...or at least have one good quality that makes them not want me..but NEED me to attend there. ahh this is so frustrating...especially bcuz i have to think about this when i am only a junior...i tell you...this college stuff is going to be my downfall..

      well as the clock strikes 3 i find myself still procrastinating and haven't even touched my chemistry..lol...it is quite interesting. lol. i'll regret it when i am overwhelmed tomorrow but hey...then i'll learn and won't do it again...lol...maybe...we won't talk about that come spring break..lol. well today jesse went to some place i guess by seaport village or something there's this guitar place and i was like...don't you have enough guitars? and he said that he will never have enough...this boy is spoiled i tell you. so this means i won't get to see him till sunday..or if push comes to shove...monday..i'm strong i can do it i tell ya! but anyways...yesterday i talked to jesse...it was kinda sad bcuz i was trying to tell him my horrors of babysitting and he had to leave and make carne asada for his family. anyways...it was sad...then he told me before he left..."you know what i was thinking about today?" "what" "i really can say i love you now...like i haven't felt this way for a couple of months..i love you" it was sweet and all..but that implies he only said it to humor me and it's sad to think about...only wants what every guy wants...and doesnt' care about that..i know it was probably meant to come off romantically...but lucky me gets to think of the deeper meaning and get mad or something. anyways...i talked to cameron today both on aim and on the phone...he makes me laugh and sometimes he makes me mad...prob bcuz he really wants to go out with me...but...i have to hand it to him...when i first started talking to him...all i really talked to him about was jesse and amber or any other girl that he flirted with...but no matter how much i obsessed over him he still talked to me and didn't care that i was like that. he's a sweet guy that cameron. hehe. so yeah..i drafted some people into my fan club...lol. i have 12 members...woohoo! i'm trying to beat cameron bcuz like at the football games he had people in this whole section and i got jealous...so i am gonna get some people to call themselves my fans and it'll be great. i did a lot of recruiting today...i got like 5 new members in one day...haha that sounds like a diet commercial..well jesse's mom's birthday is on the 6th so yeah i wanna get her something bcuz she got me something for my bday and she didn't have to so yeah. and she's so cute too! hehe. i also have to get better prepared for jesse's bday...i ahve some ideas but iono..i might need to get some expert advice. lol. or interrogate the hell out of him.

well it turns out i did get to go over to his house today...we did chemistry...he explained it and there was soo much to explan to me bcuz i don't understand it at all..anyways..it's a good thing bcuz tomorrow he's working from 10-7...so yeah...i'm glad i got to go over...i'm not sure when i'm gonna tell my parents that we're going out again..so for now i'll take the hassle of them saying stuff..."harvest ranch called"...shut up. i want to be able to stand up for him...i will work on that this year...until then...i shall be doin chemistry...joyous.

      no amount of advil will help me for what i have experienced in the last 24 hours... here was my day. this whole time i thought i was only watching a 10 year old..how hard could that be right? well turns out we know a lot more people with kids that lucky me gets to watch...so i have this 15 mos. Grace, her brother Mario who is like 7ish, Hunter who is 7, his sister America(yeah the name just asks for trouble..lol) who is 8, Jerran who is 9, and Megan who is 10...and then of course my brother Steven who is 13. (a child in disguise) so anyways..i have this wide range of kids right...lucky me...lol...so i get there at like 5:30ish right and it starts off with only Jerran, Hunter, Megan, America, and of course my brother. and Hunter is being such a little punk he's like extremely hyper and going crazy and then Jerran is telling me how i should punish him and that i'm not a good babysitter...hello!! i didn't know it was going to be a full house! so that goes on for awhile and Jerran is trying to contain Hunter by holding his arms and not letting him move and then of course Hunter gets pissed bcuz he can't do anything and wants to go about running a muck and so i have to separate them. and this is when they all weren't here yet. but basically Hunter was this loud mouth and wouldn't shut up for the life of me. so then we start calming down after Hunter complains and whines about being pushed around (he's a small little guy so i guess i could see where he was coming from) and so we start doing this arts and crafts stuff...with like that weird soft material and we spell out our names and have all thsi pipecleaner and stuff and that's going all great and then Grace and Mario come and they stop playing with the crafts and start playing with Mario's gameboy advance and that keeps Hunter and Mario out of my hari meanwhile i'm chasing Grace all around the suite in the Marriot makin sure she doesn't get hurt and such. and so Russ(a friend of ours) takes the glass off the coffee table and puts it in the closet so Grace doesn't somehow hurt herself on it and as soons as he sets it down you hear this massive shatter of glass breaking..so the grownups that came t drop Grace and Mario off were all using their shoes to get every piece into the closet so no one stepped on it. then they left down to the party and everyone was restless so we were all waiting around and then the pizza comes and we get to munch on that. so then of course Grace sees people eating and gets hungry too so of course i have to feed her and stop stuffing my face and get her situated. so then after awhile she's shaking her head no and it was really cute but it was taking forever so then i had my brother feed her for me while i could eat...meanwhile everyone is being their loudest and the people in the hotel are complaining and a security guard knocks on the door and leaves. so they won't even begin to be quiet. and then 8 o clock rolls around and it is time for Megan to go down to the lobby and perform so we all go down there(this is where the problem starts forming)and they are all waiting for Megan to go onstage so Grace is walking around dancing to jazz songs and a woman singing cher's if I could turn back time...yeah...and everyone's all running around and going up to their parents to say hi and be with them and i'm trying to make sure Grace won't run off bcuz she won't let me hold her bcuz she wants to run around...then finally Megan dances and we can finally go back in a closed room. then they start playing Bennihannas and eating candy and that shut them up for many minutes and i'm trying to get Grace to bed but they were being so loud...mostly Hunter and America...they kept screaming at stupid things and ahhh the maturity was lacking. but what do you expect? anyways...Grace was all cranky bcuz she was soo tired and nothing i said could make them be quiet. it was very annoying. so then they started hiding from Grace and then have her walk around and se if she could find them and that led to them to start playing hide and seek and that keeps them entertained even longer except when people would stay in the hiding spot and then they argued...and it was like 11:00 and i was like...this poor kid better sleep! the others didn't seem remotely tired so i decided i wouldn't even try to make them go to bed. so i try laying down with Grace..you know give her an idea..but it doesn't work bcuz she wasn't in a crib so she wasn't caged in and she would get sad and cry when i put her down (for her own good mind you) and so i was like..ahh forget it! so she was all walking around and going in closets and opening and shutting them...and i thought i was easily amused! ha! so then it is finally time to try it again and go down to the lobby again and celebrate the new year...so we are down there and then we're having fun until it's time to round them up and go back up..i'd get one and then they'd go back in and play around...and it was like that until i had all but America and she refused to go...so i had Steven and Megan retrieve her for me and Megan brightly says how the parents are taking off their panties and so the 3 little boys that i had to bring upstairs were like "there's gonna be naked women!" and i was just shocked at them that they were even contemplating this and yeah it was quite interesting..and then the 4 of us got upstairs and they had a Bratz doll and they were gonna strip her and look at her and i was like fighting to take it from them and keep them from bum rushing me and it was soo crazy and then finally America, Megan, and Steve get back and we're there just talking and waiting for the party to end(at 1)...so Grace and Mario are the first to leave. they get picked up and go into their hotelroom where they are put to bed and then left so they could go back down and party. and then later Jerran is picked up and i am left with 10 DOLLARS!!! 10!! from 7-1 only 10 dollars! omg i was like...well thank you...bye........*die* it was horrible. and then Hunter and America were complaining that is was boring in the suite where we were and wanted to go back down there with her mom and it was just so tiring. and so they were all unhappy and then Hunter and America start crying and in the bathroom (life is soo unfair isn't it?) and then their mom comes back. and then she asks me if they were good and i was saying how they were loud (it was even hard to say that...she looked like she was ready to kill) Then they go back to their room and the key won't open it up and so they come back and we all go down to get another one. and then finally that is all worked out and we go back up and then Megan's mom and grandma come back and ask how it went and they hear how i only got 10 bucks and they are outraged...but promise to make it up with their money. so i was like ok..and the grandma was so cute saying how she would ahve stayed with me if she knew how bratty those kids were. so we were gossiping about the night and that they were gonna pay me tomorrow and then my mom and Grace's mom came and they all started talking and then me and Steven went to the hotel to go to bed. and we were messing around...but damn he doesn't know when to stop..ahhh! but yeah it was horrible..i made $110..and the one with the baby didn't even pay me! ahhh! well they better pay me someday...i'll take a raincheck..and if my brother asks me how much i'm paying him for helping ONE more damn time i'm going to murder him! i was gonna give him some but man he's just soo annoying me and pestering me...and iono...i think i don't have any to spare...i earned that small amount of money by myself...i deserve it damnit! but iono..maybe i should..i'll think about it...but right now i get to go to the mall with elisa and tiff and then spend the night! weee!

      you don't want to hurt me so you end it. I feel immunity to those ending words and i casually smile as you list why it is time to break my heart..this time...So the days go by and i am not hurt by your words or you actions and i feel strong..the woman i want to be. When all shatters in an instant..how fast immunity fades in sight of jealousy. how i struggled for some sort of sign, a sign that would lure me hopelessly away into your arms. but it was not recieved...but twas granted to she...or was it the other one? the whole night how you constantly sought for another's company leaving me stranded, deserted. until the night reached its peak as i angrily stormed off obviously jealous thinking you would follow my angry actions...but you didn't. i knew i couldn't leave you like this so i crawled back like i had 8 times before and i rushed into your arms and held you tight, sobbing and blinding myself with the warm breath onto my vision. this is quite the dilemma. GO. have fun with the one i loathe and despise as a nearby friend comforts me like you once knew how to do. you say you're my best friend..and yet you left me to cry and be miserable. you said you didn't want to hurt me anymore and yet the pain is more intense without you.

      well...the days just keep getting interesting now don't they? we have these workers at my house all the time now who are doing our kitchen...so yeah it's weird...they've been playing their mexican music a lot and everytime i hear it i get the urge to listen to my juanes cd. lol...hmmm..my kitty timone just scratched me...he wasn't supposed to be inside and so i was getting him out..and then my grandpa walked on the tarp and he got scared and tried to escape and in the process scratched me...it was sad...cameron says i deserved it for "being mean to my cats." and by mean...he means(lol) keeping them outside...hello...most of my family is allergic thank you very much. hey speaking of juanes...they're playong one of his songs on the radio...wow...i'm amazed...so i'm hoping to have a flute day tomorrow...weee...those are fun...actually it's just like a melissa cameron alexis day but you get the point. and tonight is the midsummer night's dream school play..i am gonna go with jesse so yeah this oughta be interesting...we've been broken up for 3 days and i don't know...yesterday i spontaneously felt really sad...during lunch...like someone was singing along to a piano and it sounded really sad like and i felt like curling up in a ball and crying. well...at least i'm not mad at/with jesse all the time though...but i hate leaving his side without a kiss or some sort of affection. i took a quiz that my sis sent and it said(one of the parts) that it takes me long to fall out of love..and that is definitely true..i love that guy...and sometimes it's a shame when i can't show him how much i actually do...i don't know..i just hate being without him...people say i deserve better...but..i don't know...i'm scared i won't find better...i need to go on like a blind date....lol...

      i find myself arguing with a really good friend from 6th grade. it's horrible because she's mad i broke the promise of not going out with jesse....but i mean..a person can't really make these kinds of promises because of the opportunity one might go through during life. it just so happened that jesse said he was treating me badly and he wanted to keep me because he needed me...and i could tell he did with every tear that dropped...and he said he knew how he could keep me after i hesitantly told him how [he] complimented me and how jesse hadn't in forever...i need to be complimented..and after i told him...he did fuss a bit..but being back together..he has surely complimented me a lot and i know he's trying....it's just a tragic life i lead....for i know it will end all too soon...and where do i go from there? do i pointlessly ask my "friend" for advice and not take it? heck no...i ask for advice...maybe i'll take it...maybe i won't..it all depends on what i think it is right...i'm tired of people having dreams of my life and trying to mold me so i fit their dreams...i am my own person and am fully capable of everything...no one is gonna be able to help me be me. it is a job only i can uphold. but nevertheless you try and change me. i am and always will be me. why can't you accept me and my decisions? why can't i ever be good enough for you? why am i always finding fault and doubting myself when you put me down? i can't be wrong to myself...only you can make me feel that guilt. friend...why are you so bothered by him? he may not be perfect...but i love that guy as you love ur bf. times two. and dissing who i believe in is hurting our friendship..so much that you are even ashamed to talk to me...cuz i'm not worthy of your respect anymore..just respect my decision as the friend you should be. that's all i want...don't stop urself from criticizing me...maybe i need to hear it...don't censor yourself because it will only drag us down...well..it's not like i'm your bestestestestest friend anyway...so many emotions are flooding my words of rage....

      friends....family...i have realized that i am a very picky person...today i went shoe shopping...i needed black shoes..the pair i wanted was not at the location i was at...well...the right size at least...they had them in brown....sure they were barely noticeable from black, it being a very dark brown, but knowing it wasn't black angered me. and then that night i was starving and awaiting my dinner...when my family comes back with pizza! what more can a teenage girl want? so i hungrily sprint up the stairs only to find that my beautiful pizza was tainted with the very veggies i loathe..i decided it wasn't worth it to try and pick it off so back to the fridge did i journey...yay leftovers...i decide i would be happier with chicken fried rice...only to pick the tormenting green peas out bite by bite...i just hope i am not this picky with people...and yet..i fear i am...

YAY! I can hardly wait. oh man you have no idea. so i get the day off...no dogsitting for me...i get to spend the day at jesse's helping his mom watch kids....ahhhh so much sitting!!! my butt is sore...wait...considering that my dog is horny and that i have been dog sitting him...........right...we'll ignore that. but yeah it's gonna be great cuz not only do i get to make human contact...i get to help with the scavenger hunt! yay! hmmm...wouldn't that be weird if people got neutered? and only a selcted few "chosen ones" got to experience parenting and such...well i'll tell you what...the teen pregnancies would go down. unless one of the teens was a "chosen one" where they would get pregnant anyways. but yeah that would be weird...hmmmmmm...the workers of my kitchen and deck....the kitchen still needs the stove put in..(waah no mac and cheese for lex) as well as put the counter tops on....gosh...it's taking forever!! the deck guys are going speedy gonzalez fast...like...BAM WOOSH BLIP WEEE. they only have to finish making the railing and give it a little of this and a little of that.

      i amaze myself...a good thing is right in my face...but do i take it? and will i take it? or should i take it? do i fear that someone is actually better than him? am i scared of happiness? 


what is wrong with me?

      let's just face it...from the beginning of "us" we poisoned one another's minds. the belief that we would last forever...and it got worse with talk of marriage...how you pre proposed to me...with songs..."always and forever"..."all my life"..."nothing else matters"....with looks......with laughter.......and more painfully..with tears. 

it is so hard....to watch "us" die...to watch others move in to you...and i feel my body is taking over me...the rage i feel...raging with jealousy...the strong hatred moving in and absorbing every thing i love...  loved  ....about you...i find no way to express this anger...and so it builds...just test me one day...and i will blow up...you are the fuse to this dynamite stick...

so one wonders...does she actually love him? or how can she hate him and love him simultaneously?

and you know what? she can't answer this! when i am with him..i feel invincible...with the exception of a few bad days and pms...when we aren't together...i present this cynical outlook on life...and at times i scare myself...

but now...i feel betrayed. and who knows..maybe i am overreacting...but i wish he had the balls to tell me...maybe they are just friends and could never be anything but that...then why is it a secret? this is a hypocrisy. it's hypocritical bcuz he dumped me for this same reason...FOR NOT TELLING HIM! i understand he is not with me...but...it's only been 10 days...

i've been pushed around this weekend...by viruses, by words, and by actions. 

you're afraid that if we are alone...we're gonna want each other romantically...so..isn't that saying something!?! the forces of nature are trying to bring us together but you are repelling the positive energy with your negativity. 

i am the only hope for us...but...it takes two to be one. i'm half of us...a subdivision of your heart...soon to be broken and mended again by the many lovers in the near future of your life. 

there are few things i strongly believe in....one of those WAS us...

unbreak my heart...say you'll love me again...undo this curse...

      of all things..i consider love to be the most important...so why is it the hardest obstacle? why can't we be introduced to the one we are supposed to be with so we can enjoy them longer? why? because small conflicts make a couple go insane and give up on everything they have worked for. i just don't want to be lonely...do you think if i had a life i would be doing these things? no! i wouldn't have time...do you think i would go on aim all the time? hell no! i don't want to be lonely. and i think it is my biggest fear...growing older with no one waking up next to...no kids of my own...hating life and males becuase of all the pain their kind have put me through...i'm so tired...tired of guessing...and guessing wrong. what if i'm just so blind as to not realize that mr right IS in fact right there next to me all along but i blindly refuse to recognize because i can't give him a chance because i doubt it. my problem...being with someone so long...becoming attached to them in so many ways...maybe it was something i was used to...being away from you just felt wrong...i always imagined you to be "the one"...but alas you came crashing down on me..how we have made so many promises...always and forever doesn't taste as sweet any more....it means that you're not free to fuck around...you're settling for me...i don't wanna be someone you settle for...i want to be that person you long for...that you can't stop thinking about...i only know one person like that and i'm afraid to give him the chance...maybe i'm afraid that there is better..and i let myself be treated without what i truly desire. maybe i was use to you...but your lips...your love...why do i end up being the loser? why do i end up crying and you always laughing? i don't know...i'm addicted to you...i just know that right now...it's so easy to say yes to you...bcuz you have taken everything from me...i can look at you..and want you...i probably wouldn't last without you...just think of the pain with 8 years of absence...in the prime of our changing...i need a life too...away from the vay and your schedule...i could have been yours...but it's hard when you don't want me...and that pain will haunt me forever..

they said i could have anyone i wanted....what they didn't say..was that you weren't an option

      as i run to catch the winning ball...i fear i have not the arms to catch it...and there i stand in the outfield...why am i even in baseball? like a licensed driver with no consent to drive...she takes the humiliation and torture her granpda gives as he drives blindly down the street while the car at home torments her as it stays in the driveway to collect heat and dust...why take the test in the first place? to run your errands? even though you will probably have me go with you...i guess i wasn't as helpful as you imagined me to be...and it is hard to let go of your last daughter. let me grow...let me extend the leaves and allow me to absorb the rays of the sun...so i can make it on my own and stand strong in my roots.  my tears cannot keep me alive forever...no matter how wet and refreshing...i want a new taste...i want a taste of freedom...and i don't want it spoon fed to me..

      I have been having the most awesome week ever. i got contacts so i can see...up to date glasses for back up...and today...MY LICENSE! yessss! it is soo great. i can FLY!no i still can't do that but i am getting there..i wanted to tell jesse first that i passed...and so i was gonna go...until my mom's car was in back of mine...and then she moved it..but she wanted to go with me bcuz she didn't feel right yet...i was like...ok this defeats EVERYTHING! so yeah...i am hopingi can drive myself to school tomorrow and drive myself home again. we'll see i guess...Jesse is gonna cruise by today and so that's cool in the book of Alexis. lol...yes..there is a book. so yeah...today was cool. well except for the part when i spill like almost all of my white eyeshadow..the pretty angelic kind...and the part when baker scares me and bumps my stand in my chin..it hurt pretty bad. but i felt bad for the guy...SO i told him to not worry about it. hmmm...but yeah..i feel invincible...(not invisible...) nothing can hurt me right now. it's a great feeling let me tell you. aww man it was crazy... because i already had this girl and she asked if i wanted a new person but i told her that i just wanted to go and that it woldn't bother me if she did it again...so yeah...we drove and it seemed like she was this whole other person...maybe she admired me that i decided to stick with her...i think that gave me the needed courage also. so after the test...i was like...all freaked out bcuz she had all this writing and i wasn't sure whether i would pass or not..and she said how i need to not lean into the curve and such and how i need to look over my shoulder when i turn right bcuz i only did that 50% of the time...and i am just freaking out..and then she says...BUT you passed and i was like YESSSSSS!!! mostly because my permit expired on the 19th and it being the 17th was not comforting...it was basically now or never...gosh i hope my kids don't ever have to go through that...i wanna give them as much practice as they can get...oh i definitely will. lol. so yeah...jesse saw me and was like "are you hear with good news or bad?" and i'm like good news. and he smiles and is like I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT! it made me feel all great. :D  so yeah..we were suppose to go out to celebrate..but by the looks of it..we probably won't and that is alright with me bcuz i just wanna see jesse when he comes over...weee! GOSH I AM IN SUCH A GOOD MOOD!!!

      after years and years of practice, (lol) i am finally done with this years AP testing...which means...LIFE IS A BREEZE! score! wow...this week has been quite the fairy tale...lol. i feel so loved by people...i have been reacquainted with so many old friends..and people who i've never met, let alone seen, before. but it was all fun. man were those tests challenging! but yeah...i recently just saw some of my el cap buddies on friday and it was fun..i really didn't like the place we ate at...it was soo gross...but hey food is food...and being with them..made me realize how different i am...i'm not a redneck any more....i have matured into the ghettos. is this a better change one must ask? lol. signs point to yes. for all the good times i had in lakeside...there was an equal amount of bad times. and i like seeing them months later and them being all excited to see me and have happy times. as rude as that sounds. it gives me a new respect for the people at granite and how much more i like them even though i barely talk to them. but yeah at the restaurant, they were all and because they had been waiting for an hour since they got out at 11 ish and we got out at 12 ish and so they were all paranoid that we weren't gonna show..lol...so yeah then i realized i only had 12 bucks and i was like good thing this place is so expensive...and i told kristin and she was gonna pay for some of me and then i was like cool then i'll have enough for the movie afterwards...and then we go to pay the bill and i give 10 bucks to kristin and she gives a 20 and then i'm like..ok...now i lost 2 bucks bcuz my meal was 8 bucks...and then i was like...ok whatever and then we go to the movie and i tell elisa and erin my troubles and they aren't too happy that they have to pay for me. so we are in line looking at the times and we were too later for the movie and so i gave elisa my 2 bucks and then she never gave it back so i was jipped of 4 bucks this day. that was quite sad...i am trying to save it so me and jesse can go to 6 flags...he's never been there and i think it would be fun to go with him just the two of us. but anyways we got some starbucks and erin bought a frappucino for me...it was reallllllly good too...vanilla bean....yum! and then we just walked around and they bought some mother's day stuff which i have no plans for.. :/ so yeah. that was fun..and i can't wait for the next get together...

      Twinkie. he is my baby. he is 4 weeks old and i love the heck outta him. i got him from my mom's friend and i couldn't ask for a better kitty. everytime i go to feed him or just to see him, he runs up to me and purrs when i pick him up. and sometimes he licks me and i feel like i have this very special bond with him. i have friendship with him and we need each other. he needs me to take care of him and i need him to be there for comfort. it's kinda like a bird loving a fish...but not...bcuz i am allergic to his fur. i spend a lot fo time with him and it sucks that i have to be allergic to him. and i'm mad that he has all these fleas on him. my mom and i are going to give him a bath and hopefully drown teh fleas. don't ask me how we're going to do this..but...we shall see. everytime he cries i rush up to the door and open it slowly and he is there and he purrs and i pick him up and he purrs more and lets me love him. every girl needs that type of companion, someone to love. speaking of love...in summer school we are talking about relationships and it is pretty interesting. the girls sat in a circle and named off things that we liked and disliked about guys while the guys were in an outer circle listening and then we traded. i think it was pretty cool. i was glad jesse wasn't there because it would have been weird to hear him say things that i didn't do that he likes and things that annoyed him. but yeah it was funny. i noticed the guy who sits in front of me kept looking at me...he's pretty cute. he has a nice voice and i love his back. lol. and i am crushing on austin too...he is soooo freakin gorgeous. but yeah i can always dream....and dream i will.....I LOVE MY KITTY!!!!

      Today is Friday and i am filled with emotion. i think i'm at that point where i want someone "there" but i lack the extra confidence needed in seeking that attention. Monday Allec called me and i thought my life was going somewhere...imagine....alexis with a popular guy. that is too much like a fairy tale to me. Something that is only wished for in dreams, and broken in nightmares. i saw jesse today...and it was different...with him i didn't feel as much longing for him as i usually do and so i am glad i am healing...but there is still more healing to go through before i can be his friend and his friend only. i kept conversation going. i think healthy paths will do wonders for that aspect. it didn't even hurt me when he said that the chick yelling/drilling him was hot. am i just confident that it would never work? a part of me misses him, but the rest is kind of relieved. i can't expect to try once and then find THE ONE. it can't be that simple. and i hate it for that. so after talking with jesse again and feeling somewhat empty i decided i'd call allec just hoping that maybe he'd be able to do something. it turns out he said he couldn't talk right now and that i should call him later and then i'm like no and he's like well ok and then hung up. i never got the chance to ask when. i feel teased. and it's weird...when i talk to him i am like more aggressive. i don't know why but i am. i think what started the emotion was the guest speakers today. they were talking about safety and heone of the girls was involved in a car accident and has a bruised spinal cord and is partially paralyzed..and the story was so hard as far as holding back tears...how one of her bf's told her that no one was going to love her but him bcuz of her condition and how he'd lay her on the floor and put the canes away so she couldn't go somewhere he disapproved of and i felt so angry that a guy could do that and i felt so sorry that she had to go through with him and all his verbal abuse. and then she was saying how she got married and how she miraculously had a baby and how special her child is. it was the most beautiful story ever and i hope i can have that much courage. that would be the greatest gift ever. OF course now i am scared to drive bcuz of all teh risks but i don't think it can be avoided. if it happens, it happens and that's the way God wants it. i am so glad it's friday though...i deserve a break. i'm so glad that summer school has short days. well i am getting sick...the workers are here and they have this great blend of cement glue and drugs so i think i've had about as much contaminated air as i can handle....(learned that in healthy paths too)

      i don't know what to say. allec is really good looking...wow...ok i guess i did know what to say. but like...i don't know. i don't think i can just be his benefit friend...i would hope that i was desireable to be dateable. hmmm i don't know..right now...i think...omg! allec!!! he's soo gorgeous! and then i think...he's random...funny at times...and smart. and then i think about the beer he drinks...that can't be good for like...his body..as in..muscles. i swear i am like barbie looking for her ken. lol. weeee...does that make me shallow? no..i just have high expectations...ok yeah i know it's the same thing....damn. for now i shall see how things go...so he called me yesterday as i said...and... called him today in wal*mart and then we were talking about nothing interesting..and then his friend showed up and then he said to call him back...(wow we know who DOESN'T have the whip..) lol. but...i am gonna call him anyways..lol. just because he is so cute. and..hey ya never know what could come out of this. oh yeah! i never went to that party yesterday..he never called me and i never called him...i couldn't remember who was supposed to call who...ha...anyways...i want to stalk him..lol. i think it would be fun. lol. oh! and i'm hoping to get connections from kat...she's gonna get me conor info! woohoo!!! she said that he was tall now. wow...i love tall guys. lol. and let me think...i don't know a lot about him...he probably doesn't even remember me...ohh that's sad. but who knows...so hopefully all goes well. lol....wee..

      man i've had some good times..and some bad ones. i went to see harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban with kat on friday. and then afterwards i saw nick! it was cool...he looked so gorgeous i must say. and he was sooo funny...like he was all random and hyper and we were laughing so hard...well i was..i told him that i would hire him when i was bored and he was like...YEAH! I SERIOUSLY WOULD! and so i was like...cool! so we were talking about how we were so bored this summer with nothing to do and it was fun. he was making fun of me but it was so funny. maybe the fact that i hadn't seen him in forever or the fact that i was deprived of the outside life made him that much more funnier. so yeah that was friday and it was great. but then of course i got in trouble bcuz i was talking to him for like an hour and i never told my parents that i was with him and not kat so i got in trouble. they took the car away from me and i got in trouble fo not having my phone on so they could contact me. and also the fact that i left the house open (WEll my brother did)so buddy was running around the house like a maniac. anyways...right now i am excited bcuz i had an unexpected phone call. from an old crush...who..is in fact..still realllly hot. ALEC! ok this is what our convo was like. (he'll be the one in " ") "hey alex" yeah i don't know anyone by that name..there's an alexis here..."yeah that's what i said..do you know who this is?" alec. "yeah..i was wondering what you were doing tonight" umm nothing. "yeah i was wondering whether you'd want to come over" i don't even know where you live. "don't worry i can pick you up" oh great that means i have to get beautified. "no you're already beautiful" (oh golly) ... and then he was basically telling me how his parents left a bunch of beer in his house and how he's had a diff friend over everyday. and i'm like oh cool. and i was saying how i was thinking of calling him but never got to it. so yeah it's weird bcuz his parents aren't there and like...iono..it's kinda weird...bcuz it's a school night...my parents don't know him. i can't lie and say there are gonna be parents...i'm on my period. don't get me wrong though...i wanna go bcuz he is cute and i've liked him for so long. omg i am freaking out..i am so nervous. gosh that was so unexpected...right now he is at football practice from 4-6 so i don't know. i don't wanna feed him all these excuses...besides i don't even know when he would pick me up or anything. lol. wow i'm a loser. i would feel wrong to drink...it's just bad in my mind. but...i think he would be a good rebound...wow that's messed up....speaking of which...i think i am getting over jesse faster than ever. i still think about him though. and i miss him..but i'm not like crazy obsessed missing him. lol. so that is good. it also helps spending time away from him....but yeah...alec called ME...things are looking good....

      Got out of town on a boat goin' to southern islands.
Sailing a reach before a followin' sea.
She was makin' for the trades on the outside,
And the downhill run to Papeete Bay.
Off the wind on this heading lie the Marquesas.
We got eighty feet of the waterline.
Nicely making way.
In a noisy bar in Avalon I tried to call you.
But on a midnight watch I realized why twice you ran away.
Think about how many times I have fallen,
Spirits are using me, larger voices callin'.
What heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten.
I have been around the world,
lookin' for that woman, girl,
who knows love can endure.
And you know it will. And you know it will.
When you see the Southern Cross for the first time,
You understand now why you came this way.
'Cause the truth you might be runnin' from is so small.
But it's as big as the promise, the promise of a coming day.
So I'm sailing for tomorrow, my dreams are a dyin'.
And my love is an anchor tied to you, tied with a silver chain.
I have my ship and all her flags are a flyin'
She is all that I have left and music is her name.
Think about how many times I have fallen,
Spirits are using me, larger voices callin'.
What heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten.
I have been around the world,
lookin' for that woman, girl,
who knows love can endure.
And you know it will. And you know it will.
So we cheated and we lied and we tested
And we never failed to fail, it was the easiest thing to do.
You will survive being bested.
But somebody fine will come along make me forget about loving you.
At the Southern Cross.

      i think the world likes to laugh at me...you know...kinda like the friend who makes fun of you for one of your imperfections. and then they magnify that imperfection to their enjoyment...and your humiliation. i believe i have found the one....only...i found him too soon...i found him while we were growing into adults. in the prime of our youth. and it couldn't have been a more worse time. for now there is college ahead of us. and as we have slowly been molded to each other's liking...we are forced to part for the betterment of each other's life. so we're not attached. i know that if i had met you 8 years later....it would have worked. for now....our immaturities hold us back. and it hurts me to watch you carry on...wondering why you have to be so wonderful...i would give everything for you to love me....i can't stand other girls...the ones who flirt with you...and fill me with rage...i don't wanna watch you be happy with them. i don't wanna share you. damn i am so involved. i need this summer to meet someone. why am i so clingy? ha. and just when you think you can't cry any more...

      have you ever had a dream over and over again? when i was little...i use to dream about this doll at my grandma's house that had yellow yarn for hair and i'd be walking inside this office like place and there would be all this movement and toys that came to life...and they would be everywhere and i'd always get grabbed by these two things and then i'd be killed by that doll..and one time i got so freaked out that i took the doll and hung her on a hanger upside down as punishment...and i never had that dream again...and now i have a new dream to add to the stack. this week i have been dreaming that i'd jus be around and then all of a sudden josie would come up to people and poke them with this pointy needle like thing. and when she got to me she would slowly poke me it into me and i could feel it...not that it punctured the skin...it was just like an unpleasant stick in various parts of my body. so last night i started having this same dream when she punctured my butt all the way through it was weird...the same thing...just different conflicts but in the same way...yeah that makes no sense..lol. it was strange though...josie...seems kinda random....too bad i can't hang her up in my closet where she can't escape and attack my dreams again. maybe they are over...it's strange though..how dreams work...i had a realllly weird dream last night...i was walking to this house..i can't remember if it was supposed to be mine or not but i was walking back and this body was sprawled across the front of the house and i had just been dropped off my someone...and it was weird...bcuz he all of a sudden was close by and i started witnessing the death of two black people..it was like watching a movie...only i was more included...and the terror struck me harder...the couple were on a boat in a swimming pool and the boat started sinking and they just stood on the boat in the water and the assassins made their way and grabbed the woman..and she made no effort to extricate herself...and i was watching her being drowned...i don't remember what happened to the man i think "the movie" focused on the girl and her struggle with air. and i saw the bruises on her face and her face turn a sickly pale and blue where her veins were trying to breathe...and i woke myself up...trying to forget that image...i swear music can help anyone...it made me think of other things...and even when i started drifting off..and seeing the distrubing images...i could hurry up and turn the music higher and think of happy thoughts...i guess that is what my life is doing to me...i feel like i am watching the relationship die...and i am not ok with it..it hurts me...pains me to watch...but it dies all the same...and then..you wake up..and it's not real...and you get a second chance at life somewhat...to dream something different and make the girl not drown...make her a fighter and prepare her so that when a bad situation comes...she'll do all that she can so she can't be beat with words or with tears....yes...i wanna be stronger...

      hmmm...and i thought it couldn't get any more complicated...well..it can. so i was gonna go somewhere with matt today...turns out we are both freaking alone and need company. i've been talking to him a lot on the internet and so it's pretty cool. so i had talked to jesse a bit online and he was like "so you're gonna hang out with matt today?" and i'm like yeah. and then he had to go and i was like ok. and then he called me and said that they had gotten in a fight and that matt is just doing this in spite of him and that if i go with him it might come back and bite me some day...i don't know what he meant by that but i was like...oh great...i can either be fuckin lonely again or have jesse be mad at me when i didn't even know they were fighting...so then matt calls on the other line and he says he doesn't think today is a good idea and he's sorry for being a hypocrite cuz he said that everyone was blowing him off and now he's blowing me off...and i was like...well that's ok...and he's like tomorrow would be better and he said that him and jesse were mad and so i said that i kinda knew bcuz jesse wsa on the other line and so i said it was fine..then i went back to jesse and told him that it was matt and that he was cancelling today (bcuz matt told me to say that). and so i was like ok...and then jesse was like...why can't you go spend time with YOUR friends...why do you have to hang out with my best buddy? and i was like...well they have summer school and they were like well it gets out at 12 why don't you do something then? and so i was like..yeah...and so he said that he had to go..and so he hung up. ok maybe it was a bad thing to hang out with his best friend...but heck..me and matt are friends too...not as good as him and jesse are but damn...and maybe i would hang out with my "friends" if they called me...the only person who has actually called me was baker...and yeah you know how that goes...and jesse has called me too..but those conversations are more serious than they are fun believe me. now i have senior pics coming on the 29th of this month and i have to get my hair cut and i have to find some clothes that are long sleeve...most likely i'll find them in a store. then tomorrow...student leaders are cleaning up the band room from 10-4...basically bcuz it's ugly back there...i agree...damn i hate being alone!!! but i guess it's good bcuz i have some major reading to do in One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich...it's gonna be a long read...today mrs. robinson called me bcuz of the conflict in my schedule...i think i just have to take a class at grossmont...i'm gonna take calculus there bcuz i want to take AP gov't. and besides...if i take a class at grossmont...it's only like 2 days a week...but the hours would be like 5-7ish...so that could affect school...but it's not everyday so that is good. well i am freaking tired..and bored...i should probably read anyhows...

      i am so alone. all day i stare at this screen...or the tv screen...with my eye on the phone...hoping...praying for someone to just call me for good measure. but it turns out no one thinks about me. maybe it is my fault. i let things/people get in the way..but not anymore..i want to go somewhere with the people i call friends...i am sick of these four walls...i wanna leave....breathe the fresh hot air....hoping that it stings my flesh, giving it a nice tan. i am cooped up inside...friendless...insanity creeping over me...you people don't realize how lucky you have it...you are out doing something everyday...with those close people you call your friends...they aren't just a title...they actually are there...and i do have some of those kinds...but not enough. we talk about doing great things..but somehow they never get accomplished. and that desire to just breathe.....to live...is taking over me. i don't mean to call/email you all the time...i'm just lonely...

      i have decided...that i don't want to let things get to me...SCREW THIS DRAMA BULLSHIT!! when i am sad...i'm gonna look ecstatic...i hate spending my days crying over the same thing...i'm not gonna try to create my future...i'll let fate be in charge once again. sure the love is still there...but i'm not gonna let it or anything else interfere....i just wanna be happy again and not have to worry about the bad things. this year will dominate me if i don't realize that i need to take control now. Band camp? no sweat! there is no such thing as band drama...not anymore...the solution? don't date guys in band...don't date younger guys..and that pretty much solves everything...be in the right crowd..don't be jealous...don't be clingy...it's a new year's celebration for me...the resolutions...and the cheeriness of it all. i will not be destroyed...i will make it...i will survive...and i will be so damn happy...see my smile? GET USE TO IT!

      Take it back, take it all back now
The things i gave, like the taste of my kiss on your lips,
I miss that now
I can't try any harder than i do
All the reasons i gave, excuses i made for you
Are broken in two

All the things left undiscovered
Leave me empty and left to wonder
I need you
All the things left undiscovered
Leave me waiting and left to wonder
I need you
Yeah I need you

Don't walk away

Touch me now how i wanna feel
Something so real, please remind me 
My love, and take me back
Cuz im so in love with what we were
Im not breathing im suffocating without you
Do u feel it to

All the things left undiscovered
Leave me waiting and left to wonder
I need you
All the things left undiscovered
Leave me empty and left to wonder
I need you

When im in the dark and all alone
Dreaming that you'll walk right through my door,
Its then i know my heart is whole
Theres a million reasons why i cry
Hold my covers tight and close my eyes
Cuz i dont wana be alone

All the things left undiscovered
Leave me waiting and left to wonder
I need you
All the things left undiscovered
Leave me empty and left to wonder
I need you, I need you

Cuz i cant fake and I cant hate
But it's my heart 
Thats about to break 
You're all i need 
I'm on my knees 
Watch me bleed
Would you listen please
I give in
I breathe out
I want you, theres no doubt
I freak out, I'm left out
Without you, im without
I'm crossed out
I'm kicked out
I cry out
I reach out
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Don't walk away

      I just wanna talk to you
And my broken heart just has no use
And I, I guess promises are better
left unsaid, yeah
Everytime you try to tell me 
You say the words that im the only 
But I'm the one who's crying on the ground 
When you say love makes the world go 'round

      There are so many people...friends...who are depressed...this summer seems to be their downfall. and i don't know how much longer i can deal with it. maybe a couple trips away from this screen and the drama will just disappear. and then lack of human contact would suck. i guess it is inevitable. today i talked to jesse...he called me on his new cell phone. it was weird because the called id picked it up as jason shahan and i almost didn't pick it up. so yeah...he spent like too much time with his message...i was like...omg what a nerd. whatever though...and when he gave me the number...it was really weird..bcuz i wanted to keep calling...but i decided against it bcuz then he would regret giving his number to me....but what is kinda sad...is that he said he got it a couple days ago...and he just now gave it to me...so yeah...but..his intentions are good...cuz everytime i try to call his house...his sis picks up and says he's not there even though he is. so that makes me feel just wonderful. one time i went crazy...i had just talked to jesse...(this was a week ago)...and i hing up on him bcuz the convo went bad....basically he was saying how he was going to coco's with this 24 year old...one of the parents that his mom babysits...and i was like...ok did you call me to tell me this? what the hell....and like last time before this he called me and he said how heather was coming over for guitar lessons...i'm like..well what the hell do you want me to say? it's not comforting...and so anyway...he started saying how he knows there's gonna be drama when we go back to school bcuz of the whole band thing and what not. so he's like i shouldn't have called and so as he was trying to say goodbye i hung up...and just cried because it sucks feeling alone..when your ex can't even talk to you...so i called back to say sorry for hanging up..and his sis answered and said he was gone and then i was like ok..bye...and so i thought...this is bullshit. so i fixed myself up...grabbed the keys and drove to his house...i made sure his car was there...i called again..is jesse there? "no he left somewhere" well did he walk? "huh" well i am looking at his car right now "oh..well maybe he went with my dad" no that car is here too (i was bluffing) "oh....click" man did i feel crazy...so i walked to the door and sure enough..there was jesse..on the opp. couch from his sister...what a BITCH. so he answered the door...and so we talked and it was basically another shut down thing..and i told him that he was controlling...don't wanna go into too much detail...just thinking of this makes me soo angry...is my stress caused by him? i don't know...now i feel angry again..hopefully it is just pms...hopefully...

      i realized something...all those times i let you in my room...no one made each other do anything...it wasn't that it was forced on me....it wasn't that i didn't wanna do it...it was because i love you...it was a way for me to connect with you...the only way you would let me have you. i could kiss you and mean it...touch you and feel you...it was great because you made me feel so warm...how i hated the end. for you'd remember that you didn't wanna start "us" again...and you'd leave..not letting me hold you...that made me forget that it was about love....until now. yes...i love you. with all of my heart. there was never a doubt...it just got lost in translation. as i think of it now...i miss those times...when i could just hold you and call you mine. when i could kiss you....how stupid i was in the beginning of it all. freshman year. it pains me...to think it would be forever...there are only hopes and dreams that it will work for the best. what was even more stupid...was that i took having you for granted. sure...at first glance i was in love...and i followed you as long as i could....how you let me walk with you one day...but alas...at the beginning...i pushed you aside...ashamed...of what? i don't know. when certain people would walk by i would push you away and watch them...wait for them to walk away and then grab your hand again...in merriment...oh the confusion...and then after i had warmed up to you...and i knew you really cared for me...i'd let you hold me all day. and we became so involved...we became each other's best friend and pushed away those who once meant something before there was an "us" ...and how you waited for me...with each month you waited until i was ready...you never left or gave up on me...it all depended on me...because you cared for me so. and all the praise we received...the tallys of "you guys look soo cute..." the cliche "i wanna find my jesse" as if you were the perfect guy. and you are...sometimes...remember those late night conversations where we would just keep laughing all night...or wet calls when you would tell me how much you needed me and that you would never hurt me because you loved me soo much...was that your plan? to brainwash me...to think i needed you. damnit jesse...get one thing straight...i want you....i always have...whether you want me too...is a whole different story...it doesn't matter what i want...because you are and always ahve been in control...i still have a heart with your name on it...and if in 8 years...of pain...or letters...you realize it too...then you better be 100% sure. i'm tired of games. maybe i just need the year off...

      Notice me
Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when
Our love is strong
Why carry on without me?

Everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you baby

I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear
What have I done?
You seem to move on easy

And everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you baby

I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry

At night I pray
That soon your face will fade away

And everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you baby

      wow i don't know where to start. well...let's just go. lol. so yeah...today i was supposed to go see a movie with this guy i don't really know, and he lives in alpine and his name is steve...and we were gonna see anchorman...but then he cancelled because he is going on a cruise with his family for like 10 days and he said that he had a ton of stuff to do...so yeah that sucked...but there are other days left to do things...besides...what if i did go and i started to like him...i'd have to wait forever until he got back...so hmm...so then..last night i wrote a letter to teh guy who sits in front of me with this reallllllly great back...and like...i was gonna give it to him like...before the final bell rang...but yeah..he left! and what's sad is that...i learned that he smoked. so yeah..that was unpleasant to know...but damn his back was hot! speaking of smoking...so yeah...steve's friend, trevor, was talking to me...and he was sending me pics of him and giving me the 3rd degree...and yeah he had pics of cigars in his mouth so yeah...so now i am wondering whether steve smokes...so yeah...we shall see. but yay! he told me we could do something afterwards...so it seems like he is still interested...and it's cool...cuz like..with him..he's really nice..but he makes me choose...and i'm like...AHH I HATE MAKING DECISIONS! but i think that is a good thing. so..moving on...i learned that someone likes me today. and he's younger than me...and i think i have a problem with that. i like older guys...i'm not like cameron diaz. i want an older man..like...a year older...not younger!!! so yeah..he thinks i am giving him signals..and adi was trying to convince him that i wasn't. lol. and then...there was austin...wow...HE IS SOO BEAUTIFUL!!!! i couldn't stop staring at him...and he caught me a couple of times...it was weird...one time he caught me and i stared for awhile and then he left my gaze. so he probably feels freaked out. lol. but it was cool. bcuz we left a little early bcuz it was the last day of summer school and it was perfect...cuz he was closer to the door....and he got up as we were saying goodbye..and then he walked behind me and my jaw dropped. hehe. a part of me wants to think he did that for me..,but eveyr time i think that...it's wrong. i guess i just have a big ego...and i think that everyone wants me..ha...i wish! but yeah...i use to talk to austin in 9th grade of english class...for some of the year...he sat behind me and it was cool. i'd make him laugh and such...i think i was braver then...i don't know...i have to work it again...i'm still weak from previous relations...yeah...and i think i am done with allec...HE SUCKS! he always has to leave when i call him...if he wants to talk or something..he's gotta call me...cuz i am sick of being rejected by him. so yeah...and then there is cameron. i'm not sure about him...he's young! ahh! and then there's jesse..i don't know how i feel about him...i think i just need more time still to heal. and it's hard when i don't have men to surround myself with!!! i need to like...get some air. if you asked me if i love jesse...i would hesitate...so i guess that is improvement on my part. i still feel like he is the one...and there is a purpose that i met him. i'll learn when god points me that way...right now i'm just going in circles...

      i am gonna be pissed....if you go out with someone this year...i don't think i can handle it...who's to say they won't hold you back from your full potential...who's to say they won't keep you here...who's to say that relationship won't be serious? who goes into a relationship without a desire to be serious? that means you would have lied...to me. saying you didn't want a relationship because you need to focus on annapolis....that would be worse than breaking up with me all those times. it would have meant there were other reasons for our split..which you lied about. why am i so confused when i know you're not the one? maybe it's my desire for you to be the one. i don't intend to hold you back. i want what's best for you...i just want to be included...don't run away from your feelings...i know there is a place in your heart that only i can fill....hmm..i wonder if i say that enough..it will come true....

        So here i am....tired from a week's worth of band camp, with more still to come, and tired of things i am put through. loneliness is the one. i feel alone when i breathe, in jealousy, in exhaustion, in happiness, in pain. i don't know what to look forward to. i kinda want to just sleep through it all...hoping it doesn't follow me to the other side. i don't even wanna think about things. i'm not gonna have drama...this is why i type it here...this is why i hold it in until i am alone. i'm always alone. i wish someone could find some time for me...and yet...another dream remains...matt t. is sooo gorgeous i wish it were possible...an "us" someone to make me forget. distract me. your flowing hair, your big smile...why are you so entertaining to look at? and yet...you remain a prisoner to a queen. a drama queen. i'll let you have a life...my mission is for you to notice me...to hug me...to run my fingers through your hair. maybe i need to step it up a notch in the game of love...i will make you want me...i'm gonna win this game. you are already more beautiful than words...but damn i know we could be...i need to saw those chains...the ones that bound you to her...i need to make you forget. i can't keep my eyes off of you. change my views...all i need is a sign...

       this is soo awesome...i can change the font and everything! wee for blogger! today was the first day of band camp...and it went soo well! the freshman surprised me with how well behaved they are...of course a few of them are kinda slow at learning basics...but the sound is even awesome too...i am really happy...jesse even talked to me...so i'm glad there isn't drama. it's weird not having adi there. but i will have other classes with her so i will be strong! besides..i have a crazy amount of physics hmwk. ergh!...and now that i have government...i have that to start yet too. damn! i'm not gonna wait another week...i better get on it! so i am in the best possible mood right now. even though i am pretty hungry....well i can't wait....24 more days until i can rid myself of being 16....wow i love it!

      I wanted you to know I love the way you laugh
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away
I keep your photograph; I know it serves me well
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain

‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome
And I don’t feel right when you’re gone away

You've gone away, you don't feel me anymore

The worst is over now and we can breathe again
I wanna hold you high, you steal my pain away
There’s so much left to learn, and no one left to fight
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain

‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open 
And I don’t feel like I am strong enough
‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome
And I don’t feel right when you’re gone away

‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open
And I don’t feel like I am strong enough
‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome
And I don’t feel right when you’re gone away

‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome
And I don’t feel right when you’re gone

You've gone away, you don't feel me anymore
