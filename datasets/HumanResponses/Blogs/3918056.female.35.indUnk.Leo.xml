      In Memoriam.  father's day 2001  the last day i saw Richie Lynch.We spent the evening at the poolside where his sister Gina worked at the time.. my sisters were there and a few other good friends and we all had a blast. Richie and i even went on one of the East End's famous 7-11 runs.. he was the Notorious 'Salt Daddy' to my sister Patrice,and he got her some Fritos. and he would get the shitty nachos for my sister Colleen, filling the top part of the nacho holder with a ton of the nasty hot cheese-food product. We had the best talk about life and the universe, about how we all would spend the holidays together, all our families, kids, siblings.. we had such happy thoughts and dreams. we were singing along to the radio and we saw a hot pursuit police chase through the tiny crap ass town of Southold.we went back to the house and we stayed out very late, all of us at Gina's, talking, enjoying and laughing. Richie had the knack to make everyone feel good about being around him, and helped everyone to feel better about themselves. I remember that night, Patrice was self-concious about her bikini and he kept saying she looked like a goddess, how beautiful she was and how he felt she was so gorgeous, inside and out. He was telling me what a good woman i was, and how he respected me and was happy for me in my life. he was spending good time with Colleen, who had loved him deeply for so long, and who was just so happy being in his company. His sister Gina was a caretaker at a home for mentally challenged adults, and we were hanging out with the guys in the house that night. One loved Richie like a brother and follwed him around all the time. Richie would treat him equally, as we all did, but they way he treated him was just so touching, it made me cry. He was a loving, caring, man who shared his heart and soul with so many people and touched so many lives.   July 29, 2001.  I was in my car in the parking lot of the Merriweather Post Pavilion, with my friends Jen and Stacey, about to go into my 15th and last BNL show of that summer.We were awaiting the arrival of my brother Billy, who was going to the show and i was so happy and excited. Stacey's cell phone rang suddenly and it was my mom. She sounded sad and colmly told me to sit and said' A terrible thing happened." my heart stopped. I knew someone had died. "Richie Lynch was killed in a car accident this morning". i dropped the phone and screamed. screamed No. over and over again.my friends were trying to comfort me and i got the phone back. my mom just told me to stay where i was and that my brother would stop there to see me and then he'd be coming up. I knew i could not just leave my car in Maryland. i know i could not drive yet. i knew that i had school the next day. so i stayed there. my brother came by and hugged me and we cried. Some girls gave me a beer and hugged me. i never saw them again. i went into the show, i had found my friend Fred and we watched Action Figure Party and he just held me quietly as we sat in the rain.we went to our seats and listened to Vertical Horizon. BNL came out and i actually cried through the whole concert. i cried and cried. i looked up at the sky and sobbed and asked over and over again 'why?'.after the show i fell apart more and my friend Dana drove my car and Fred drove me to his apartment in NJ. the next day i went home and the mourning began.when i went into the car to drive home, the radio turned on and the song that was playing hit me so hard..the lyrics fit perfectly and i KNEW Richie was there with me. i knew we had a new angel in our lives watching over us. And i have felt him with me every single day since.  I miss you Richie. Thank you for the time we had. Thanks for loving my family and being like a brother. you are always an angel in my heart.  the song that was playing was the same song Richie and I sang together on the way back from 7-11 the last night i saw him..  (words by james taylor) .  Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone  Susanne the plans they made put an end to you I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song  I just can't remember who to send it to I've seen fire and I've seen rain I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend  But I always thought that I'd see you again  Won't you look down upon me, Jesus  You've got to help me make a stand  You've just got to see me through another day  My body's aching and my time is at hand  And I won't make it any other way Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend But I always thought that I'd see you again  Been walking my mind to an easy time  my back turned towards the sun  Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around  Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line  to talk about things to come Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground  Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend  But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now  Current Mood: melancholy Current Music: 'Soma' - Smashing Pumpkins.

      I have found out over the years bits and piece of my history. It's always been just bits, though. I know my mom's family is Irish and until I was about 21, I thought I was Irish and Italian. Not so. My mom told me that I was Turkish/Assyrian. I did not know what to think, but I kind of just said, "ok, that's fine'. Then more and more I find out that my grandfather and his mom fled their homeland due to the Turkish people killing the Catholics in their country. Wow.. That was sad! That as so upsetting to me. I loved my grandpa Charlie and thinking about him and his mom running away from these bad people trying to kill them because of their religion was so upsetting to me. I was close to my grandpa Charlie as a child. He died when I was 7.   Now I have found out more than I ever thought I would know and it's so exciting and yet sad.  I have engulfed myself in Armenia and the Genocide and anything I can find out I apply to my family research began as a yearning for knowledge of my whole family history has split off into groups. The Kennedy/Higgins side of my family will be the easiest to research, and I am putting that off in favor of my paternal grandfather's family, the Foronjy's.   I decided, at my therapist's urging and my own curiosity as well, to dive head first into this search. I began witht he internet, of course. I spent a few weeks getting so frustrated by the websites like Ancestry.com, which wanted more money than I could afford for the information I truly want. One day, I got a link to a great site which linked me to the Ellis Island information site. Here when I did a search for Foronjy, suddenly the first piece of the puzzle was in my hand and I burst into tears. I KNEW where we came from, I finally had an inkling of this part of my heritage, and I finally knew, after years of hearing what it might be or could be, I finally knew our family's true Armenian last name. It was such a breakthrough. My roommate thought I was losing my mind. Completely the opposite. I finally had this piece of my past I had wanted for so long. And now I have decided to really go through with it all.   The first known Foronjy seems to be a man named Habib Fouronnchian who arrived at Ellis Island on May 22, 1913. He was 22 years old, and single. He left from the Port Le HArve in Seine-Inferior, France on the ship NIAGRA.&nbsp; His place of birth was Ohomay, Armenia and his last residence before coming to America was in Diarbehor, Turkey.This same man in 1919 became a US citizen, and at that time, his name was changed, at his request supposedly, to Habib Foronjy.  In 1930, Habib would have been 39 years old. In the 1930 census, a 39 year old man was counted among the Foronjy family in Brooklyn NY. His name is Rskalah Foronjy, and i believe he is my great-uncle, my Grandpa Charlie's big brother. In this household there is also listed a 61 year old woman named Susanne,my great-grandmother,&nbsp;and a young man named Shukey, who became Charles Foronjy, my paternal grandfather. There were 11 people with the same last name in the Brooklyn NY census of 1930, and i have identified a few of them. One is Naseb aka Ralph Foronjy, another great-uncle, who's grandson, Eric I have corresponded with. Eric is my first link to the other parts of the Foronjy family. I am hoping his dad, Richard will be able to fill out the Family Questionnaire i have created.  I also found out from my mom that my great-granfather, Nusry Fouronnchian, was murdered by the Turks in the Genocide. He was murdered by them because he was Armenian, and because he was a Christian. Many people do not realize that the Armenian Genocide is the first mass genocide of our century, and not the Holocaust. In fact, Adolf Hitler, while persuading his associates that a Jewish holocaust would be tolerated by the west stated "Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?" it's so sickening and even moreso now that i truly know one of my family was included in this mass-murder of good people.   i've talked so much now i feel drained. Please, if you are interested in my stories and my search, keep reading. I may make a separate blog just for my studies and research, until then, Thanks for reading and if you'd like to learn more of the Armenian Genocide,  urlLink go to this site.    Thanks again, all.

      I’ve made this mental note to myself to NOT wear work shoes OUTSIDE of work. Ever, ever again. Work shoes ripped skin off the backs of my feet/heels and they burn and hurt like oh dear god I don't know WHAT.  I’ve decided to make a post here as much as possible. I didn't yesterday because I spent that time writing the return note to my father. One of my biggest struggles in my life has been the existence of and the relationship with my father. I am the oldest of all my siblings. In the first marriage of my mother, Pat, to my birth father, Bill, there were three children. Myself, my brother, Billy and my sister, Patrice. We are each 2 years apart. My relationship with my dad was a typical one at first. He had a very loud voice and an angry temper, though. I remember sitting with him watching 'The Wizard of Oz' one night and the dog pooped on the floor. He beat the dog really hard. I was maybe 4. This is my first real memory of my father. That and him getting hit by lightning through a CB radio. He yelled and cursed a lot. But thankfully these are not my first memories of my life.  My first memories are these:  Somewhere around September 13-14th, 1971. Billy was born on September 11th and this was the day my baby brother was coming home from the hospital. I am a little over 2 years old. I remember someone giving me a brightly colored bowling set, plastic, and me playing with it in the hallway of our house. I remember not much more.  I believe the next was December 15, 1973. My Aunt Roe and Uncle Joe's wedding. I am the flower girl and I think me and my mom are wearing matching dresses. I am crying. My aunt and uncle were two people I loved very much. They were musicians and they played music and sang. I just remember crying. I remember Aunt Roe's room and the John Lennon Poster.  I remember February 1974, around the 6th. My sister Patrice is being brought home from the hospital and my Grandma Claire is there with us. She bought me a beautiful doll. It was a family tradition to get the children presents when they had a new sibling coming. It was supposed to be a present from the new baby.  These are all really happy occasions in my heart and mind. And that's all good, but they were interjected with some really shitty things. My dad was very abusive to my mother. He beat her. A lot. hard. She would hold in her cries so we would not hear her. She didn't know how to get out. She didn't know how to stop it. And unfortunately, she didn't know until years later that I witnessed a great deal of this abuse. This is one of the things that has haunted me my entire life, and still haunts me in my dreams. The most vivid was the time he threw Mommie down the basement stairs, made of cement. I could hear the bones break. I was standing right there and he saw me and did it anyway. He then left the house. Mom somehow made it up the stairs, gathered some things together for us kids, got us into her car and drove from Patchogue, Long Island (NY) to Brooklyn to her parent’s house. Once we got there, I believe Grandma Claire brought Mom to the hospital where they found out her ribs were broken from the fall.   I also have this memory in my mind. My mother caught my father cheating somehow. She decided she had truly had enough. While we were asleep, she packed up some suitcases and had them by the door. She knew he'd show up early in the morning, hopefully before we would be waking up. He came home and she told him he had to leave. He tried to hurt her and she threatened to call the police. At this time, Billy and I woke up, we started crying and as my dad took his suitcases and walked out the door, my brother goes out the door screaming 'don't leave daddy! nooooo'. Just thinking about it rips me apart.  That's all i have to say right now.

      this is going to be FAR from my Live Journal. this is the ramblings of I, Jenne.  I'm Jenne. i'm 34, i'm being treated for some sort of mental disorder that has not totally been determined, i want to write about things and i want them to be seen heard whatever. this may be fun and silly but it can also been downright sad and dark. It may be just annoying. but i don't care. i needed a place where i really feel i can talk. No pretty pictures, no emotion icons, no links,and just what i want to say. I know i am able to disable comments on LJ. but this just feels better already.  for years i have had difficulties in a number of areas in my life. from the spousal abuse in my parents marriage and subsequent divorce to the rough times i had as a student with a learning disability and social issues, paternal abandonment and my stepfathers mental illness. my family being torn apart and the knockout of losing 4 family members in the span of 3 years. struggle time and time again but somehow i made it through. There are people with much bigger problems and i'm not looking for pity or anything. this is me cleansing myself.this is bits of the puzzle that make up my life.and my therapist says this is going to help me.  so mote it be.

      ((Note to reader: i wrote this on December 13, 2003. it is my first writing to help me through the rougher parts in my life))   i love Ben folds, with or without the five. he makes me think a lot about things i hide inside me. i love him for writing 'Brick" because it shows what a good guy he was to his girlfriend when they got pregnant.How supportive, and trying to be there and help her through the shit she had to go through, and you realize the male point of view of the situation. as opposed to what happened to me.  ****WARNING**** and if you know the song, you know what happened to me. if you don't, it's called abortion, and if you have a problem with that, i am sorry. don't read any further.     it happened ten years ago.it was Memorial day and my brother Bill and i went to a party, in Southold, ny, where we had gone to high school. We met up with a bunch of people we both graduated with, and we all went to one of the infamous parties at Horton's lighthouse. these parties were massive, fun, drunken gatherings because none of us really had anything else to do. i never really attended them in high school, because i liked my world of music, art and my little group of friends.everyone at this party was so overjoyed that i'd gone. i was 24 at the time, and well, it was just nice to see these people i'd never really known in HS.  One in particular, was a nice guy i always liked cause he was a musician, and we were having such a great night. we spoke of so much and it was just so cool. i'd been dying for a friend to talk to about music and he kept bringing me more and more drinks, and then he asked if i wanted to go to this other part of the beach.i remember getting into the car, and waking up in the morning, in the car, missing my shoes and sockings and underwear.he was sleeping in the front seat and i wake him, asking him what the hell happened.he just laughed and said 'don't worry, you had a great time'. i yelled and cried and just left the car. i got myself together, and went back and asked him,'did you at least use something?' he said yes, of course! (my aunt had recently died of AIDS and i was so scared). i made him take me to the local 7-11 where i called my friend  to pick me up.i tell her what happened, and i just could not believe that i would have slept with someone i hardly knew, and while drunk.. and i didn't think i was *that* drunk...i was a big drinker back then , with a high tolerance, not to mention, i'd only slept with one person at that point in my life. i decided to just wash it off, i was an idiot and just to move on with my world.  then my world exploded two weeks later.my dear period, which was NEVER late, was late.and i knew, i KNEW that fucker had inpregnated me.  i waited two more weeks, praying, crying, talking to my two best friends, Karin and Meri, who told me they'd be there.i tried calling the Guy numerous times. everytime he'd blow me off.then i went for the test. and it was positive. and i knew what i wanted to do.it was selfish, yes. in some circles, i am a murderer. but i did not want to have a child when i knew that:A-the father was (i found out) a supposed drug addict.b-i was not mentally stable to me a mother.c-i was not able to carry a child AND give it away.so i contacted the Guy once again, to tell him what was going on. he once again did not return my calls.   i decide to tell my mom.   My awesome, strong, fabulous, beautiful mom. She promised me she'd take care of me, and do whatever i decided.i feel so bad i did not give her grandchild back then when i see how badly she wants one now, and how bad the odds look for me giving her one, ever.she ended up trying to call the Guy and ask him for half the money to help me out.his MOM ended up talking to my mom...telling her what was going on. after my mom explained to her the situation, she told her she'd come over our house.she came over and wrote me a check, and apologized that her son was such an asshole, and if i needed anything, she'd help me out.  then my dear friend Jenny gave me the other half to help me out.Thanks Jenny.  my mom took me, along with my aunt. three days later i was in the back of my brothers buddies car and i moved away from that place. the news had spread all over town..and i was going through hell because of it. In some ways it was a gift. i got the hell out of that crappy place. i got to go somewhere new. and i got to be much closer with my awesome brother.(thanks Billy)  i went home years later and had to deal with him in line at the supermarket.where he was so nonchalant and tried to make conversation. it took every ounce of my being not to punch him. Him with his three children and me with the memories i have to hold with me forever. the guilt i have to hide and cry about alone. the guilt of what i did, when if maybe he'd have called me, or just said 'i'm sorry' or ANYTHING it would have maybe helped me.this is ten years inside me, and hardly anyone knows this about me.but if i didn't write it out today, i might just cry myself into oblivion.i'm thankful for my friends that took care of me, for my Mommy, and Billy.and i thank Ben for writing that song and for making me cry a million times, but in a good way.   and thanks, Ben Folds, for being a real man.

I miss fat Texxaco and Grendel that now live with Greg. I miss my old house. i miss Gallery Of Sound and thier excellent prices on CD's, and the cool guy that worked there that would give me posters and free stuff. I miss Stroudsburg and Main Street Music. I miss Sideshow Skip, The "Greatest Percussionist in ALL THE LAND" and Matt "Math" Abell. I miss BEN AND WILBIUM.I miss Perkins at 3 am.

But, I really, really LOVE Boston and everything i have found here.More than i could ever fit into a paragraph.  "Who's ever going to ever know the world before it goes?"-Jack Kerouac
