      I realized something today... The events and activities that I am involved in neither require my existence nor would be significantly different if I were not existence. Don't get the wrong idea here- this isn't one of those "now I must leave you, goodbye..." Suicide notes, goodness. I guess what I'm trying to say is that my problem is that I don't know the problem.  Everything was particle's peach a month ago... I had a girlfriend (which I subsequently broke up with, something I still think is correct and gave me a few precious social points, LOL) and I felt I had some sort of purpose in life. But before that, I had some sort of "connected with the world" thing going on, setting my purpose as to, redundantly, find my purpose.  However, I get back to my original problem: my existence is slim to none, which brings me to the title of my exploration.  While I clearly want to be part of this thing we call society, my problem has to do with choice- not in simple "do I want to or not" sense, but my choices afterwards. Does my mind and heart say that I want to be in society, yet my hand and mouth waver away from the human spectacle? Am I choosing the incorrect path to my entrance into society, and thus, my choice is no?  Then again, choice itself is a problem... Whether or not we have actual choice in life, we will never really know. (just watch the first two Matrix movies and you get a pretty good idea about the whole "am I choice or being controlled?" concept. If not, watch the second one again- I had to ;) However, if I don't have that choice, then what purpose do I have here, running around with no visible or implied impact on the Earth as it is? How does this lead me to becoming a better person, or a place in life? People tell me almost everyday about how I'm going to be something big, or something along the same lines, but this sheltered life stunts the growth of social skills that I need to communicate with people- the most important skill on the face of the Earth. (What have been the most important revolutions in the past 1000 years? The book, the telegraph, the radio, the telephone, the television, the internet. See something?)  So, with this heavy feeling in my breast, I headed to the only place in my mind that seemed like I still belonged, or was visible: English 1-2 Honors, Mrs. Kimberly Richey. I have that weird feeling like I have to return home or something. However, I waited and waited, and she was no show. I instead went to my personal confidant, Mrs. Kimberly Stansberry. (Spielman (I hope I spelled that right...)) I have that weird feeling around her that we are cut from the same cloth... Visions of the same person at different periods of time, something like that, LOL. I told her that things were going pretty crappy, school's boring, even in the hardest coarse loads. The only advice she offered was "Hang in there." A persistent voice within my lifetime- it will come.  I wouldn't mind waiting half as much if I knew what I was waiting for, or who, or a clue to something of my sum total. But, as mere humans, I must live with the limited foresight that I have into my immediate future, vision of what I think is the present, and hindsight and horrors of my past.  And, returning again to my problem, my problem is choice. I choose to wait. I choose to be who I am. I choose to believe in the future.  in love.  in hope.  in faith.  in life.  The problem is choice...  I just hope it's the right one...

      I laugh, I cry, I don't know why. I'll tell when I figure it out, but you wouldn't understand, no doubt; for the complexities are too demanding for only one person to be left standing after they take the monumental load of undertaking me; They would explode.  I am left alone, as it will always be, but if you're reading this, I guess you're with me.

      When I walk around, often starring into empty space, I end up finding my center. While some find theirs talking to people, competing, communicating over a computer, or finding some other way of communicating, I find mine without the need of another person.  This is a unique trait for a human being, not necessarily good, nor necessarily bad, but, never the less, a trait that I cannot help but accept. What are the topics of my internal search? They vary, but I would be lying if I said that people have nothing to do with it. Indeed, people often always have to do with my thoughts, which was originally the reason why I started this blogging thing in the first place. I wanted to talk to people about, well, people. As redundant and unusual the topic may seem, it is a fairly interesting one and one that plagues the philosophers though the ages. (as I would like to think of myself one of them, plagued as well.)  Why is humanity the greatest topic of discussion, with endless points and infinite conclusions? Well, why we want to talk about us is simple: humanity is a social animal, and as such, we love to boost our ego by talking about ourselves in the positive.  But as we all know, humans almost always bring up the negative: look at any newscast- rape, murder, drugs, slander- all negative. Thus, while people love talking about themselves, they love even more bringing down others. This stems from our competitive nature, and as such, can get very ugly, very quickly.  But why are we this way? In this modern society, we should not have to resort to violence to solve our problems, correct? But, on the contrary, the greatest problem with this argument is that it assumes that all humans can restrain themselves from violence, and we most certainly cannot, especially in our wired world. Violence is inherent in our nature- if you brought up children is a socially neutral environment (which, I know, is impossible) the children would still be violent.  Why? Our genes tell us to, simply, get more, better, and be stronger. Genes give us the "Keeping up with the Joneses" complex: the next door neighbor always has more, better, and faster stuff than you do, and you must somehow catch up or be left behind, which is a fate worse than death for our social mindset.  So how can we save ourselves from this inherent original sin?  We can't.  We can teach our children never to hurt anyone, to never curse, to never say bad things, never to raise a hand against another, but that original sin of violence will still be there, ready to explode at any given point in time, resulting into a rebirth of violence in the system. In short, the violence inherent in us breeds more violence, eventually touching everyone.  In order to remove this original sin of violence, we would need to change what it means to be human, and, essentially, destroy all humans and their offspring, which itself would be a violent act which would bring an original sin onto the species that finishes us.  Quite a pickle, isn't it?

      Humans, by definition, are flawed. We do not enjoy the ability for things to go right every time. With the insights that hindsight can give us and the knowledge of things we cannot change, we sometimes wish that we could change such things.  This, in itself, is not a bad thing. Slavery, looked through the eyes of a modern society with civil rights of all its citizens, is reprehensible and would never be stood for in America today. We have learned a hard lesson over the thousands of years that we lived under the laws of slavery; it is wrong, pure and simple. Thus, we have changed our view to the modern motto of “All Men created equal,” and as a society, have advanced.  However, we would be prudent to say that if we could go back in time and change everything that slavery should have been abolished. While we know now that slavery is wrong, slavery also built nations and empires that the United States of America later used as the basis of the free society we enjoy today. It is not uncertain what the consequences of a free society since the dawn of man would have on the pages of history; nor is it something anyone would be able to know.  Another trap humans can get themselves in is a large on that can destroy great men: living in the past. I recently found myself in this quandary: I had begun talking to a former old friend of mine whom I loved very much at one point in time, and for a minute, I felt that feeling that nothing changed and that everything was the same again. While I would love to live in an infinite loop of my freshman year, not having to deal with the graduation of some of my most important friends and never having the events occur that separated me and my former friend, I knew this was not possible.  Yes, I greatly enjoyed that time we spent together, but no matter how much I wanted it to continue, I knew that I was living in a reality that does not exist. I would have done anything to get back to that point, but no matter how much I try to fend off the tides of time, I know I would fail. Humans do not control the domain of time, nor should we.  Another thing I realized with my friend is that she was stuck in time as well. While I know that time has passed, she, nonetheless, stayed the same. I found I was still talking to the friend that I used to always talk to, with no improvement or decline. It was then I realized how much I had changed from the time of our departing, and how much she had not. After months of no contact, I had found the same person when I should have found a different one, as she had.  Thus we get into the problem of living in the past. For the past two weeks, I was trying to live in my freshman year, with all the fun and carefree that it provides, but for the past two weeks, I had found that I had not grown and that I did not learn anything. I was looking back and found things I already learned and faces I already knew. My friend has the same problem; with her face turned to the past, she does not have to deal with the responsibilities that the future brings us, or find an exciting new world with peoples and places that you would never dream of. She has been missing that for months now. God only knows how many more months she will.  So I get to my final point of this whole long-winded essay of sorts: do not live in the past. The past is a great tool to learn from, but something wicked we can get caught in. The past may contain histories of great men or exotic places, or be as simple as the friend you lost touch with along with way, but learn this: none of it is real, nor will it ever be. The past is dead, and unless you wish to join the ranks of such, you should be well warned to stay away from it.  For the future!

      The old man said it again. “No.” “Not a single thing?” “Nothing.” In a rush of wind and color, the man was back in his school days. He was 12, and walking with a girl behind his school. His cheeks were rosy red, and he had a funny look on his face. He got closer to the girl, and he planted his face right on hers. It wasn’t a kiss, really, but for a 12-year-old it was close enough. The girl’s eyes started to water, and they she was crying. She ran away, and the young boy was perplexed. The old man’s face didn’t change. “Not this?” “No.” He was at the Junior High Dance. The boy was sitting by the wall, looking out at the girl he had loved before. She was dancing with another guy. He was taller than the boy, and much older. The girl was happy. The song was over and the two started walking to a more secluded part of the school. The boy was just out of earshot. He heard the girl scream. The old man’s face didn’t change. “Not this?” “No.” It was a party he had his sophomore year with the football team. There was booze everywhere, and drugs were abundant. He was drinking heavily, and the lights started to dim. He turned to a girl who had been drinking as well, but he couldn’t see her face. They stumbled into the back bedroom. Things started to blank out. He could see himself undoing his pants. He saw the girl nude on the bed. The old man’s face didn’t change. “Not this?” “No.” It was Senior Prom. He saw the girl he had a crush on in the sixth grade, and they were dancing together. She was smiling. He was smiling. They were both happy. They walked out together and drove to a hotel. She was sitting on the bed, and he was on the other side. She started to take her clothes off, but he wouldn’t let her. She looked disappointed. She tried again, but he refused. She slapped him and stormed out. The old man’s face didn’t change. “Not this?” “No.” He came home from work a little earlier today; he was luck to have that last meeting canceled. It was a long day, and he really just wanted to spend some time with his wife. He called for reservations at her favorite restaurant in the city, and he already called a babysitter for the kids. He opened the door, and the TV was left on. He saw a pair of briefs on the couch. He looked into the bedroom. The old man’s face didn’t change. “Not this?” “No.” The old man was sitting at his apartment. He had a wife. He had children. He was now retired, and he hadn’t seen either in several years. His daughter calls sometimes. His wife has been remarried several times. Now all he does is sit at home, reading books, watching the news. He turned off the television, and closed his eyes. “So not a single thing?” “No.” Death took his hood off, and the old man saw the face of St. Michael, the Archangel. “You're ready to begin. Follow me.”

      I bought a box of chocolate for her. She really liked them, and we spent the time together. I was always the same; I would take the coconut and she’d get the almond, I the caramel, and she the cream. I can't remember how it started, but every week we would sit there, eating the little box. It was our time. At first we talked when we ate the box. At that time we would eat each piece at once, not really tasting them or anything. As time when on though, we would talk a little less, and eat the chocolates a little more. It was less about what happened and more about what's happening. It was less about them and more about us. We got to a point where we didn't talk at all. She was there. I was there. I had the box, and we just ate it. We both knew what was going on. We both knew what the other was thinking. We didn't need to say it anymore. We knew. When I look back on it, maybe I should have said it. We knew, but we should have known... I should have known...  Now all I have left is the last unopened box. I still wait everyday for her to return. I still have that box in my locker. I still know. I just wished she did too.

      I know it’s been awhile, but give some time and maybe you’ll understand why.  This blog has a small purpose. It is meant to communicate to you, whoever you may be, what I am thinking, whenever I get around to it.  Of course, I know a lot of you think that isn’t much of a purpose. That’s when you notice this isn’t much of a blog.  I’ve wrestled around with the thought of giving making this blog more than it is. There are times when I sit myself down in front of the computer and actually write out many things that I would like it to be.  Ask me sometime and I’ll show you.  But every time I do that, I know I won’t do it. I won’t put in the time or the effort. I won’t write every week because I have to. I won’t take a bunch of pictures to inflate some server somewhere.  Why?  Because that isn’t this blog’s purpose.  Some blogs exist to report news, others to speculate, still others to do many other things. The list goes on. Some of them are great. Some I read most everyday.  But there are times when I am looking around and I find a blog somewhere and read a few entries. They’re filled with nothings about everything… everything about nothing. These are the blogs that many people write. Hackers. Crackers. Geeks. Nerds.  These are the blogs that have no purpose. No purpose but to exist.  And, though my blog may be small, and infrequently updated, it has something that I would never want to take away. Something that brings you here. Something that makes its existence worthwhile. Something for me to rely on.  Purpose.

        War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.             -John Stuart Mill (1806 - 1873)

      Human Beings have always had a problem with change.  We like to be where we are, and would like to keep it that way.  If we could be happy all the time, we could choose to; it’s just our nature.  Now, of course, that never happens.  Last time I tried to use a remote to pause my life, I got several odd looks from people.  Alas, it did not work.  In fact, many people spend their entire lives running away from change.  Child Stars constantly try and reestablish their careers, old celebrities try to steal the spotlight, and old politicians always run from themselves every election year.  These people spend their lives trying to improve their life by becoming what they were, and in the process, become nothings.  So running away from change doesn’t work.  It makes sense though; change is said to be the only constant. The standard. The certainty. The absolute.  Those of us who understand this fact use it to our advantage: we seize the present, but look forward to the future, and are mindful of the past.  Change is an unlimited resource for all of us to use.  For those who use it, they gain the knowledge and courage to lead tomorrow.  For those who deny it, they are left behind in the dust of the past.   Go with the flow.
