      i woke up to mikey urlakis on the phone so that was a nice surprise. we just kind of floated around all afternoon and had a rousing game of scatagories. we went to jimmy johns and there was a huge huge spill. it was nice but kept inchin twords me so i was scared.   urlakis has been working on making a cd of the saddest songs that he can write in order to have some sort of effect on society. so i wrote a new song called third that i really like. and i recorded it over there. it will be open for the public in maybe a month. its just not for people to hear right now.  we sat in urlaksis room for i guess about 2 hours. it was kind of crazy and i didnt really know what to be doing there but we jsut sat around and joked and talked and napped and punched and threw things and played guitar. it was a relaxing time and now im finding it hard to keep my eyes open. chris will be leaving soon and i miss him already. i didnt get to see him near enough this summer. and he wont be back for 20 days. that is crazy. i will see him soon enough. im excited to go to the show tomarrow to support minogueani. the shirt is most def coming off. it has to as far as im concerened. some thigns must be done. and even though it isnt an other kids show we will do it anyway.  im listening to a little joykiller and it is making me feel good. despite the name.  enemy---the sandman. and enders game again for keeping me up till 5 am.  something old-----  im sorry if you cant see why i don’t treat you like the rest---i cant say that i love you, i cant be second best-- i cant float through life on wishes and dreams that dont come true---i wont go looking for an angel and find you  refrain its not that i intended for life to end this way--but the more that i was hoping you would the less you want to stay---and i cant just watch the sunrise and accept another day---if im tired of the game you want me to play  i wont except im sorry because youve done nothing wrong---and i wont pretend youll be my friend if i write you a song---ill watch you walk away from me with a spring still in your step---i had one once but ive got nothing left.   and if your looking for compassion please look the other way---i never thought that you were pretty till you said you were that day----and if i cant hold my head up high accepting who i am---then its safe to say you never were my freind.   -----------  wiping the blood from my hands facing the ghost of my dad wiping the blood from my hands.  the joykiller.  i cant believe im trying  to change before im dying because the seed from the trees never far.

      so i woke up today to run some errands for my dad. i dont know if that is how you spell it but that is what i did. i just kind of drove around and picked up a part and came home and sat down with some mnms a piece of pie and enders game. everything kept getting in the way and i decided to go with johhny boy and steff to modern music so john could buy an amp. we sat around after that and i played alot of brandnew inspired riffs and made up alot of songs about the loneliness and sorrow and groupies. it was a ball. i dont know if steff liked them or not but whatever. we then sat down and had a good listen to some serious beautiful freak by the eels. it was magical. i came home and played with james's new zip zap which was a ton of fun. we had that pizza where the crust becomes a breadstick and i tried my first sour flavor ice. wow. gross at first now heaven.  i had to clean my room so i rearanged it completely. it looks wild now.i put on a little ok go and i was set.  ive come across a realization that i am just begining to understand.  for all of you who know peter stokus. i am him. alright this sounds funny. but im the him of my grade. and he is the me of his grade. and i never understood what drew me to him and now i know. we are both basically the same character. we have the same values kind of and believes and tastes and everything and we both act the same at school and get treated the same. he said hes known it for a while and that is what i would have said if he told me.  Piratepeter151: we are one of a kind  tonight i saw badIIboys. hey i htink i got the logo right. well.  i cant say anything about it except its an action film on crack and on x for a few minutes.   enemy---the bad guys in the movie. but they get whats coming to them  something old----mr minouge is turning 50 that seems old.   i guess im going to plug alis blog on this thing. weve been through good times and weve been through bad and throughout it all we have remained some what of alright friends. i dont want to boast our friendship becuase i have been an ass to her on numerous accounts but there are alot of reasons and she knows why. maybe she doesnt. i dont know. if you want to hear them. if i get a few replys to mikey@benlee.zzn.com ill put up why i was a jerk to her on the forum. but here is a link to her blog.  http://radiant87.blogspot.com/  so go have a good time there and read about her day. its alot more hip then mine i promise   she called me a good songwriter or whatever so i guess i have to write a good song.  im not going to wake up today theres too many problems to face like you left on the early plane and im left like this again  im not going to worry to day if everything is going wrong because you wont be gone for soo long because ive already written you a song  refrain and were in love and where still kids life doesnt get much better then this. oh i wake up and should be worried that your gone but im soo happy because i have found someone   verse 2 im not going to argue today im just going to sit at the park with my friend till it gets dark and say that ive filled my heart  and they wont laugh at me today because theyve never felt like this because were are all just kids because ive got someone to miss  verse 3 im not going to fell bad today theres nothing to worry about like she lives soo far away i keep pushing those problems out  and you cant bring me down today i never knew i could feel soo high without really seeing her much or properly saying goodbye  well that all comes off of a story about a girl who means/meant the world to me last summer and i guess if you want the full story up on the blog a letter is all it takes.  love mike  tonight i dont know why i signed it like a letter

      i woke up to steve on the phone. so that got me up and going like nothing else could. he came over and taught me some guitar things for a new illinoise song that should be rocking the charts. after a few minutes we decided that the best thing to do with our day would be to spend a few hours playing grand theft auto vice city. i dont know if you have played it but its like a drug. you cant stop. we went around with swords in the game and calling ourselve ninjas as we chopped the head off of innocent people as we ran around a miami esq setting. after that i read some more of enders game. i read it in 7th or 8th grade and found it on my shelf last night and was up way to late reading it. its a very awesome book that i suggest to anyone who likes me or chris vasich.   james lost his cell phone so i had to go find it. it was at someones house and i went to the door and tried to apologize for his idiocy but they didnt care. it was all good. and then i decided to drop in on steff to see what she was up to. turns out she was reading hp and we watched her peter and paul graduation video. there are alot of weird looking kids who went there. we then went to bakers square. it was my first time. i guess im trying a bunch of new restaurants. im not a sit down and dine guy. i like wendys arbys and mickey d's. fast food is waht i love. the rest of it can just get lost as long as i am concerned.  i got to see hollywood pat tonight and i think he is going to start writing songs. i cant wait to see what he comes up with. JR and i went down to the park and hung aroudn and played some silly games for a while.  and for anyone who thought bdubs was dying steve and i are going to be working on new stuff thursday. im overjoyed.   so here is a song im working on writing  where you looking for an answer to the question you just asked? is history a mystery or a message from the past ? can a story be told to anyone who has the ears to hear? and can you truly feel that love is real when shes way over there?  refrain and do not ask questions that i cant give the answers to and dont say that loves a joke because im in love with you and stop feeling so sorry for me when i feel just fine and then when  i dont well just give it time  verse 2 did you call me tonight to talk to me about my day or to just sit and listen as i think of things to say and you ask me how im feeling when you know i feel like shit but you always loved to put my face in it  verse 3  and try not to tell me everything that i know is too true i get that from everyone else i dont need it from you and dont look so sad at me when i act the way  i do im a fool through and through.  enemy---enders game for keeping me up sooo late.  something old. when i used to have a bed time in the summer.

      im now officially in the hole 6 bucks. i went and played poker with john and steve and alex and steve p and hollywood pat. i watched rounders this afternoon with steff and i guess that made me want to play poker. its like starting your own right club with friends. its a bad idea. alex lost 26 bucks and the night before hollywood pat lost 41 bucks. i consider myself lucky. we sat around a table and talked for alot of the night and it was good to just do that. and talk about games and life and john. it was a really really fun time. i think i wont bring money ever again. but just go to sit and watch. im not a card shark. or is it sharp. ive heard both.  im listening to the eels and loving it. the album beautiful freak is my least favorite but its still soo good. i dont know. its soo nice.   enemy----time. summer is coming to a close  something old---yesterdays sillyness

      im up to late again. and i have to do church tomarrow since i skipped it today. so i just want to write some lyrics or something  were going off the deep end  learning how to swim in the shallowest of puddles thats exactly where i am looking soley for perfection focusing just on your face a heart that needs no introduction  get me the hell out of this place  refrain  so i look into the eyes on my tshirt to find hope in a tired smile of someone who might as well be dead and i wonder how i cant keep from giving up when i know that i would rather die instead-----of loving you.   verse 2 were carrying our passports as we wonder where to go into every different airport  i meet some people i wont know in a week or two ill see you but thats when i get home so for now ill just keep giving up on feeling so alone.  so i look into the eyes on my tshirt to find hope in a tired smile of someone who might as well be dead and i wonder how i cant keep from giving up when i know that i would rather die instead-----of lneeding you.  verse 3 so i close my eyes on a plane and try to not believe that the girl that im coming home to is the one who watched me leave and i guess i feel ashmed of myself for never looking back to see you on my street because i will always regret that  this song feels like enough for me.  enemy---i love everyone. i guess i dont like zorak from space ghost  something old---the feeling of getting good sleep.

      mikey and i walked around my neighborhood taking pictures and then we went up to the park to hang around. a bunch of little kids where there and i gave him permission to scare them. so he just kind of played the huge creep and they ran around and loved every minute of it. eventually they tired out and started playing a game called wood chuck. which we instantly dismissed as a bad game. when they came closer to us we talked about thier game and told them a better game was truth or dare. so we started to play. and for this one kid who we called chains when he said truth i had him pick which one of his friends he would get rid of first if he had to. and none of the boys would kiss the girl. so that was pretty lame. we then headed into the downtown for a little streetmagic/snatching. urlakis would do his pen trick and then i asked the people for a quarter and did some pathetic magic. then ran off with their money. but i brought it back to the people. i just couldnt do that to someone. i guess im the honest theif. it was a really good night and urlakis feel in love with the eels. so the night was completely worth it.  ill probably write some songs tonight and put them up.  enemy--people who make jokes right before i steal their money  something old---hearing are you going to stick my money up your nose?

      its almost 230 in the morning. and no one is on instant messenger or anything and i have no one to talk to or really think about for that matter. and maybe thats what feels off. there is not really anyone to think or worry about. and all i want to do is write a song that is good enough. and play it with steve and have buck wild be a band again. i love the prudes. but buck wild was legend. and i mean. sure. i cant sing for crap. just put in the cd you will see. but steve could play a mean guitar. and i mean that. and i just want to go back to those days. before all these bands came on the scene and left b w in the dirt. and i guess its where i put myself. so i want to get out of that. but that will take time and work. and i hope minogue has the time. i guess i just never wanted to bother him once mai got big. he had a band that everyone really liked. why did he need me. i dont know. that is a dumb way to think. so i just want to write some songs. and if it takes me all night to get some good ones so be it. so here i go.  i realize that im walking towards your house feeling pretty sorry for myself i stop in my tracks to turn around to wake up from my nightmare or call for help  and i look up to a sunny sky that i dont really see myself in today and i feel bad being outside breathin all the air so selfishly  ----------------------these lines seperate broken ideas  you walk up to my door to knock it down with conversation and some dignity i try to look relaxed and not appear to look like i might need anything.  and were at the bowling alley remember when we dated how awful i had felt that month how much of me you hated and now i cant look at you without feeling soo stupid and you gave me some poetry and im really glad i used it up  tonight is not the night you fall in love so just go home and suck it up youve been trying for romance since 98 with a song you wrote for her you never played.  --------------------------------  so i wait for feelings to over flow my sadness as you count the times i use the word like in describing your own beauty you cant say you even knew me for fear it might reflect badly on you  -----------------------------------------  i clear my throat and pick up the phone and talk to you for about an hour as i sit in the dark and you expect me to call when i get back well the boy you knew is never coming back  and dont question this new person standing right in front of you with ----- i need to stop this that first part didnt even rhyme  -----------------------  im up to late thinking about tomarrow and you wonder what you'd say to me tonight if you had the chance to talk or try to borrow some thoughts from someone who always gets it right  -------------------------  i decided to write more parts to the novella of nothing, so here is a new chapter. if you dont have anything leading up to it. there are about 30 pages. and just send a letter to mikey@benlee.zzn.com and i will send you it all.  Chapter 7  Mikes mom picks us up for the party at marks house. She drives us there and doesnâ€™t even ask if the parents are going to be home. I donâ€™t think it really matters anyways. Most parents donâ€™t even care what happens in their house when they are home. I walk through the front door and music is everywhere and so are open bottles. Some rap is blaring over marks dads stereo. I think its jay z or snoop dogg but who can really tell anyway. I walk around the house until I find lisa. She looks unbelievable. She is wearing some tight top that shows off her belly button and some pants with strategically placed rips that make her look both sexy and like a construction worker. She comes over to me and kisses me right on the lips before I can even say hello. She tastes like beer and for a moment I want to gag. And then I remember that this is what im supposed to be doing. I walk over to the cooler and grab myself a beer. I open it up and start drinking. Everyone is just kind of wandering around trying to make their lives a little better. Guys are telling girls to show their boobs and girls are telling guys to really listen to them. God I love high school parties. So lisa and I go out on the back porch. She starts kissing me again and I stop her. I need to ask her questions. I need to know what she thinks about things. So I ask her â€œwhy do you like me?â€� and I sit and slowly sip my beer while I wait for her answer. She turns to me and doesnâ€™t say a thing. But starts kissing me again. â€œhey cut it outâ€� I yell. â€œcan you answer the question?â€� but I know she cant. She doesnâ€™t care why she likes me. If she does at all. God I knew mike would keep doing this to me. He keeps giving me things and then taking them away. I just look at her and say â€œlook. Can you just leave me alone. I need some time to clear my head.â€� So she stands up and starts walking away. And right before she goes through the sliding glass door she looks back. And she doesnâ€™t look so pretty anymore. She looks tired. And worn down. And I wonder how I look. I donâ€™t even have my coat and im sitting on a patio. Its cold but I donâ€™t let it bother me. I look up at the stars and wonder how soo many people could look at them before me and think soo many other things. If significance is what you want. Never look up.  enemy----tom  something old----dreams of becoming a writer

      steve came over and we played a little music. but we got talking about old times and the days of the snake. and he has a new girlfriend so we just talked about that. then randy and urlakis came over and we decided to start a performance arts group. it should be a really fun time.  we then played a little scatagories. and i tied urlakis  for leisure activity i said weed wacking.  i think its leisurly. some people do it to relax so screw him.  i then went with chris and his family and sarah to a chicago fire and saw a legend in action. tony mayola if that is how you spell it was playing. and he has lost a few steps. god. he was a legend 8 years ago. joey used to be really really into it. the top polish rock band in this area sung the national anthem and got some of the words wrong.  if you want to avoid bad polish jokes get the anthem right. also the first kick was kicked by miss illinois. i couldnt see her all that well but i bet she was pretty.   i came home before 10 and didnt knw what to do with myself. so i watched some tv. im with busey is on in a few minutes and i really really want to watch it.  doggy fizzel telivizel couldnt hold my attention. snoop dog was trying to get animals high on catnip so i turned it off.  enemy--- tony mayola for sucking at soccer now and letting his team down  something old-- tony mayola.

      its is now a little after twleve and i have just seen the league of extrodinary gentlemen. it was pretty cool. the ending left alot to be disired but on the whole i really really liked the movie. i think a bunch of people went into it looking for a life message. that isnt the point. the point was alot of crazy action and even more violence. there were a bunch of twists i never saw coming. i liked it alot. you should go see it. i didnt pay but if your theaters are still cool and charge around 5 go see it. it is worth 5 bucks. and there is some really cool fight scenes. there was a cool american in it too. he was the best guy. he didnt even have any super powers. he was just a straight up lucky young kid who was good at shooting.   im not listening to the ok go cd its very very good. i like it alot. the song im on is called your soo damn hot. i mean. it doesnt get better then that.   i met a really nice little kid at 7 11. his name was brendan and he came walking right up to me with his dog ben. he sat next to me and i petted his dog while he looked at his pokemon cards. and then he asked me how old i was. i was a little caught off gaurd. such fearlessness from a little kid. i was scared of big kids. he was only 11. so i sipped my slurpee petted ben and waited for chris to arive.  i saw alec at the movie theater. i hadnt seen him since school ended but he looked the same. i guess i do to. you cant really change in just 2 months maybe. he was with freshman girls so i guess hes doing alright for himself. i dont realy know what i think about that. i think if older girls dated down it would be alot funnier. date anyone of any age i say. because. in 7 years it wont matter.  once you can get into bars and stuff it doesnt matter about age. if you like the person you like them.   enemy. age. it keeps alot of restrictions. im old enough to drive. but not old enough to sign up for a library card. someone tell me why.   something old  can you just look into my eyes  and know that i dont need her still  can you talk until the night  makes me feel like i could fill  another book of songs for you  another broken record too  we say everythings the same  we say everythings the same   refrain  so lets break hearts so that we dont break our own  and lets get started on being all alone  youve got a great big heart that i cant fill myself  and weve got all these parts we dont show anyone else anymore.   verse 2  can you talk to me tonight  and know that i cant help myself  and if you look at me just right  you see that i am someone else  then the boy you thought you liked  when we were just too confused  with everything we thought was right  when everything i need is you.  this isnt even that old. sorry. ill try to find older stuff next time.

      chris vasich and i are planning on going to see the league of extrodinary gentlemen tonight at 10. he can get me in for free. and i bet its crap. so it seems right up my alley right about now. we had to find movie times and this seemed like the best choice. although i want to see some spy kids 3d. now that sounds fun. and i mean fun fun fun. we also need to go see some imax movies. i was working on a new song but i kind of gave up. i got 2 verses and a refrain. maybe someday it wil finish. probably tonight. who knows. we shot some true july stuff today.  we did the jogging scene with a blasted out street that the light was blowing off of. it was alright. and we recorded dry erase heart/getting stoned. and it will be in the movie and i guess on cd. i had to sing it about 5 times but i like the song so i was alright singing it.  enemy--whatever bad guys are in lxg  something old  greg richardson

      i went out and played some volleyball with hayes, and vasich, and tony p, and brandon, and grandpa rich. it was a very nice game. they beat us first 2 but no one was really playing that hard. we just all wanted to get outside and do something. i think hayes has my copy of perks. i need to confront him about that. i just took a shower and kind of wandered around my house for a little while. its one of those days where i dont know what to do with myself. these are my least favorite kind of days. but its alright. i think i will call randaddy and see what hes up to. maybe we can think of something cool to do.  i found out today that my secret spot was a place that some of my friends used as  a beer drop for stuff they had garage hopped. i guess its kind of funny that i have friends who do that. i wont name any names this time. but they picked a really pretty place to hide beer. i bet all the deer took it.  my enemy is the grandpa inside of g rich that makes him go to bed at 430 and catch the earlybird special. and wake up and go to 5 o clock mass and eat prunes and drink black coffee.  something old.  alright. the song i posted as my last old thing was for a romeo and juliet project. and this is what i wrote about it to turn it in.  I picked this song because it’s the only song that I have ever written that has really made me consider myself a romantic. The first two lines in the song say it all for me. “I want to see the sunrise from the pools of your eyes.” These simple lines with a simple rhyme scheme sum up exactly how I felt about this girl better then any words I could say to her. All the verses have references to nature but under the circumstances I am more taken in by the girls beauty then any thing in nature. In the refrain I have the line that says how I can’t sleep at night and that’s exactly how Romeo felt after his night in Juliet’s presence. I believe that this song relates to the play in the aspect that the main character in the song, me, is caught up in a world wind of love and is willing to die for it in the last refrain. He would rather die then to see the object of his affection cry. I believe that this song directly relates to Act 2 Scene 2 because of its use of imagery about nature and a lot of lines about eyes, which really tell the whole story sometimes.   its funny what you say to get an A sometimes.

      i just woke up at 1. and i feel very very good about all of that. i didnt get to bed until about 630 in the morning. i decided at 545ish that i would head out for a walk. and it was cold and i needed to put on a sweatshirt.  but i found the perfect cd to listen to at 5 in the morning when your out on the street. and i guess everyone has sometime they think a cd sounds best. like any weakerthans sounds better in canada. believe me. alright but if you are out that early in the morning do yourself a favor and listen to the eels electro-shock blues it just made my morning. and then iwent to bed and vasich woke me up with a phone call. so now im awake and we are playing volleyball in about 3 minutes. it should be seriously cool. i called up theresa to see if she wanted to play but shes all stressed and has to wear a dress soon so she is bummed. we said our goodbyes because shes off to a wedding for two days. i hate saying goodbye. even if its for a short time. i guess its dumb to say goodbye for a few days like that but i did it and it felt right. when i got home from my walk dad was awake and extremely puzzeled by my actions. i cant say i blame him.  enemy--the paperguy who speeds up my street in his sports car.  something old--  i used this song for a shcool project. and got extra credit becasue i had written it.  I want to see the sunrise  From the pools of you eyes Want to watch the day break  With every breath that you take Want to hold your hand in mine Together we’ll be fine  I cross my heart don’t hope to die It ate me up to see you cry  I don’t know why But I can’t always sleep at night I try to close my eyes and think of you Think of all the pain you put me through And I don’t know what to do I think I’m in love with you  Want to see the sun shine Off you hair  Want to be the one that you call dear Want to dry your eyes if they tear Want to let you know I’m here I’m always her for you  I cross my heart don’t hope to die It ate me up to see you cry  I don’t know why But I can’t always sleep at night I try to close my eyes and think of you Think of all the pain you put me through And I don’t know what to do I think I’m in love with you  Want to see the moon float across the sky And want to be with you I hope you know why Every time you brush your hair out of your eye I know that I wanna die  I cross my heart and hope to die It ate me up to see you cry  I don’t know why But I can’t always sleep at night I try to close my eyes and think of you Think of all the pain you put me through And I don’t know what to do I think I’m in love with you

      well i hope the best for you if i can be it and i will confess to you that you dont need me  to hang around your house felling sorry so you should just go out and write your story  refrain so come on come on were gonna run up past the town and past the sun into a place where darkness  is never more but much less then a day or two at a time  and if we dont get there soon enough well just sit down and give it up and never look back at the past never think about the last with a little help we will be fine  verse 2 and  i wrote a song for you but i cant sing it it was to long and true i couldnt bring it   with me across the sea so i forgot it and there was you and me but i think we shot it   verse 3 i made a choice for you  and if felt soo easy i raised my voice with you i said "cant you see me"  out on your families porch with my hands so shaky i wonder "whats it for" while they try to bake me  im really really proud of this song. i dont know. i like it alot. and i hope you the reader like it also. it started out as just me saying the first two lines to theresa. and then it became a song. its now 430 in the morning. i was up until to late talking to chrissy then theresa and i talked all about our friendship. at six flags i had avoided her in order to see if it would make me just kind of "forget her" and she had been upset because of this cold shoulder. and i really dont blame her. and its not like it changed my feelings so the whole day was a waste. so i told her all this and we solved everything as much as we could. and im really glad about this. thigns are going just fine with that whole thing. and i think ive found a new girl who has caught my eye. but i dont know for sure. her favorite movie is shawshank. so she has to be cool. more on that story as it developes.  my enemy. my computer because right in teh middle of a big discussion it kicked me off. and it got me all worried.  something old.  in a spectacular explosion of emotion i can feel the waves from every single ocean.

      if any of you make these i think you can agree that this is kind of fun. i really enjoy it. and im sorry if you dont like it. but i guess you dont have to read it. so i bet you do like it. i dont know. this whole post will be in praise of the weakerthans. i cant say enough about them. they are by far my favorite band. i just really like their music and the lyrics. and john k sampsons voice. it just all really comes together.  how i dont know what i should do with my hands when i talk to you how you dont know where you should look so you look at my hands.  a perfect moment captured in lyrics. its all like that. i know they wouldnt like all the boasting i am doing. so they are just soo good.   i guess i need an enemy for the night. so i will say the future. i was discussing this with chrissy. and we decided to live in the present until we finally needed to look at the future. because its not time. i dont know where i want to go to college. and i dont want to worry about it just yet. so the future can just get lost for all i care. i will be in the present with my friends.    imaginary lines will lead me-- to the places youd decieve me--- show me stories tell me tales--- but you know when all else fails  refrain  well i am always here for you-- and if you need it ill be there for you---  i want to love you cant you see--- and id be soo happy if you loved me--------  verse 2 broken records stick like glue-- and every one remindes me of you--- and every time you say you care-- i wonder why you werent there------  verse 3 i cant fight the felling thats been growing --- all the cards that youve been showing--- telling me its not forever-- im telling you its now of never  i dont know. a poppy love song. just like alot of them.   the one thing i dont like about this song is it is never now or never. and i feel dumb for saying it. because with me. i will just wait and wait sometimes. now or never is for the movies. real people dont always forget. if you hate this song i dont blame you. i dotn know what i think about it.

      well tonight went pretty well. mikey and ali and i did a lot of walking. we went to the spot and for the first time didnt see a deer. i feel a little let down but we did see a nice black and white cat so that kind of makes up for it. we then went up to tcby and mikey treated us to some ice cream that was very good. i got a reeces blizzard and it was like eating heaven. if anythign can be like that. i drove ali home and we met dave weir, kiel, and leeann. i think and we sat around and talked for a while.   its interesting when you like someone to see them a few months afterwards. to see the person you liked. and i would have to say that its weird to wonder why. and i mean ali no disrespect but you just have to wonder not what was i thinking. but just i dont know. and iguess that sounds mean. because we are friends and im cool with that but i dont know.  i have made another enemy and his name is FUZE. its some gross drink that got me to buy it will delicious looking berries on the bottle. but after a few sips i realized something was wrong. there was skim milk in it. and i guess i shouldnt have been grossed out but i was. it was just disgusting. randy told me i had to finish it but its sitting upstairs right now and i know i dont ever want to taste that awful drink again. i dont know. its like take strawberry nesquick. and put a bunch of grosser berries in it. and then put more milk in and vitamin b. oh god. if you dont drink it consider yourself lucky. and if you like it your dead. i guess  a running them could be for every post i will make an enemy and take something old ive written and put it up.  so here is a song that asks the age old question  did he do her?  i wanna wake up knowing i can call you---- i want you to wake up knowing that i might---- and i want to sit there wondering what ill do---- i want to sit up and think about you half the night-----  Refrain--and is that soo hard for us to do--- a guy like me a girl like you----- oh is that soo hard for you too see--- ill say i love you if you love me-----  verse 2 i wanna think love is more then just a rumor----- that we all spread knowing its not true----- i wanna hear it sometime without hearing did he do her---- i wanna say it and mean it to you  i guess its about my dream girl or something. and about high school love.

      im trying to impress a girl i just met whose everything im not im caughing up blood just because  i love you  im trying to impress  a girl i just met whose everything i want im caughing up blood because of you  i wrote this after i got punched in the face at an other kids show and had to walk home.     alright this is the pep talk i gave on a roll club meeting before school. ive been going through microsoft word to find things that make me laugh and put them up. so here it is.  What can we say when Ive said every word I think I can. Short of saying love. Short of saying I wanted to spend my life with you. Wanted. That’s the key word. But you cant see that. None of us can see that. All we see is me sad over someone who isn’t worth it. And I don’t want to be the guy whose on his bed listening to bright eyes. Icant be that guy anymore. And this is my way out. This is my key to salvation. Up on a hill with you guys. And maybe you don’t see that. But I hope you do. I hope you see that we are doing something we did as kids. And its meaning something because we say it does. And it does. It means a lot. And now we know what we were meant to do. We were meant to put our bodies through the pain and the wet and the fun. And once your at the bottom does it matter that your parents don’t love you enough or maybe your not ready to be in a serious relationship. Or your stressed about finals. Or your friends are being lame for no reason. Or the girl you like is to busy for you. And you don’t want to move on. And maybe this is just my problems. But maybe not. We are all here because we feel something. There was an energy when I said lets roll. I felt it. We can all feel it. So lets roll. Lets roll.  ha ha ha i was so young 2 weeks ago.

      it is now five o clock and i am back from lunch. i went with baby b dave wier, kiel, and dan origo. i dont know how to spell his name. we had a nice lady named sara that we kind of gave a hard time but then tipped her very well. we then went to a bunch of games stores and took advantage of a deal in a very punch drunk love fashion. it was really quite funny. i killed the mood when i said. can we go to the library. i needed to renew my card but i was off of their data base and you cant get a new card without a parent there. so i oficially hate the public library. and what im going to do is check out cds and burn them. just to show them what i think of them. and also i want some books. we ate at stake and shake and my burger was very thin and not too great. and the fries were really thin and stragne. we talked about how much we hated thier commericals and terminator 3. i played a really werid fun japanes game in comp usa called ultimate muscle. it was nice. and we listened to some rap in the car. eminem some song about the owner of source magazine. it was alright but kind of fell apart at the end. i bought some candy cigarettes at elmer fudge my new favorite candy store. i want to get a job there. i should see if i can next time im in there. they have a piano they let me play and i love it. well. i think im off to hang out with urlakis tonight. lots of love. and down with the library.

      well its a new day and i just called baby b because i think we are going to go out to chipotle for lunch. and that would be a seriously good time. there is nothing like a chipotle burrito. those things are incredible. i have 10 bucks saved from yesterday which is financing my trip. i was talking to b a few days ago and we realized we hadnt seen each other in a long long time so we decided lets do lunch. and here i am. about to do lunch with b if his parents let him. im not sure. he said hes going to call me back. so here is an open invitation to do lunch with anyone. jus write a letter to mikey@benlee.zzn.com and request a date and time and i will do lunch, diner, breakfast, brunch?, midnight snack. i just think eating with people is funny. and being with them is fun. especially if you dont know them that well. hopefully i will be going to lunch soon. and i can tell you all how that went.

      i got a suggestion from a huge fan of the site that i should have talked more about six flags so here is everything i can remember.  we get to the park at 10 and decide. were running to superman. we see the line. and say screw that. so then dan don and i took off running for raging bull. and i guess all our buddies thought we would stay with them. but we just took off. they found us later but were bummed. raging bull is the best ride. and i did it twice. i got up and all the seats werent full so i sat back down. and felt like a total tough guy. if you want to know why we ditched them i guess i just didnt want to deal with alot of seeing people i knew. i always go with james and joey and now i was with people who dont have the same ideals as me when it comes to parks. so after that we did the giant drop which was awesome. and we did a thing called the "come on" rule where each person was allowed one "come on" ride and everyone had to do it. i used mine on the tea cups to get chris vasich sick. it was really funny to watch him almost throw up as he staggered off of the platform. we rode some water rides because theresa wanted to. she didnt even use her come ons. but thats another story  for another day. hopefully one a long time away. and we rode raging bull and viper more and giant drop much more until we got on superman as the last ride right as the park was shutting down. then it was an hour and a half drive in the shadow. and the interior lights went out so i couldnt see how fast i was going. i passed under a lightpost and said 80 is too fast right. so i slowed down. but the flow of traffic is crazy sometimes. but now im home and i started this blog. six flags is fun no matter what. and water rides suck and then chicks look at your bulge in other lines when you just wear the sport shorts you used for underwear this morning. if you are like me that is. so a lot of people stared and some laughed and some grinned and i think i made a few peoples day. so that made my day.

      alright now that i know this works i will type you about today. i woke up at 7 30 and drove over to steffs to pick her and dan and court up and take them to dunkin donuts so we could all go to six flags with a bunch of other kids. but the shadow needed air in the tires and things were hard. but i took the shadow on the highway on the way to 6 flags and it was really really really fun. i had a good day and i cant tell if im burned yet. its dark in my house. but i probably am.   regardless. i think it is important for you and i the reader to have an understanding. i will be 100 percent honest with you.  and i dont really want to be. but i feel that this could be a tool to decieve and that isnt the idea. so i dont want you to wonder about what is real or not.  these are real days and real "problems" should any arise. since most of you know me i wont change any names or anything like that. whats the point of that. so all the dirt i can dish i will. also this thing lets me go back and edit messages i have put up. and posts. but i will not do that. if you have the time you can watch this grow into alot of contradictions and certainly bad grammer. but i hope you enjoy. and i hope you can see how a kid given everything can really make problems for himself. consider this my introduction to blogger. and from here on out my days begin

       urlLink   urlLink   urlLink     do you turn your head the other way to think about what you will say just to turn it back and see that she is gone  do you hold your hands in your pockets deep and wonder how you lose soo much sleep over someone who would rather just move on  refrain and its not a feeling i like getting but its one that i have nothing, should ever be this bad with your crooked smile and your tired eyes you ask me what i had just a song or two on a used up paper pad  verse 2  do you ever feel like you just dont know anyone whose at any show and you wonder how you got so detached  do you ramble on to your friends all night about how you feel when you dont feel right and if they wanted to know dont you think they would have asked?  verse 3  do you look at yourself in that same old mirror and hope that someday youd be near her but youve never looked soo ugly before  and you close your eyes while your driving home and try to imagine life alone and you pull of the road cause you cant drive anymore.  with tears in my eyes. i look to the skys. because im not a guy who can look down.

      i run my fingers through my hair and start to sing about everything that you are ao i look into a mirror relfecting me hoping to catch your eyes inside a car  i make the same mistakes time and time again but at least i know that they always work im not asking for a handle on the world so why do you keep asking me if im sure?  refrain so let me take a picture of you to capture how you look tonight and everything you said it wasnt true but sometimes it feels soo right.  verse 2  your nervousness shows in the fringes of your jeans and in the way you always tap your feet these alminoy whores want half of everything you can have it all because im still complete  you call for accpetaance underneath your breath and that the world just isnt any good its always changing and were stuck with what is left theres not time left to be missunderstood.

      there she was yesterday. this gorgeous girl that i will never talk to. i sat on the stairs and watched her stand alone and look off onto the feild. i doubt she wanted anyone to talk to her. so i sat and talked to two kids who ride my bus about thier first days of school and tried to fight looking at her. but again and again i went back. she had a piece of ribbon tight around her neck and an orange tshirt. so i sat and talked and joked about school and classes and how they willl like it if they give it a chance but i kept looking back to her. i climbed onto my bus when it drove up but i never really let her out of the back of my mind. i walked out today to get on the bus and the drying august grass chrunced under my feet and made me sick. i walked to the pool lobby to get a drink. and as i walked back to find a place to wait to get on the bus there she was. she was sitting agaisnt a wall in the shade staring off over the feild watching everything and nothing as she breathed in and out. so i walked by her and sat on the stairs. and watched a girl who is in some of my classes talk on her cell phone and wait for her dad to show up and take her home. when my bus came i got up and walked back to it and looked over at her sitting agaisnt the wall. she looked at me and i gave a small smile then went back on my way over to where tony might stop his bus.

      i never knew goodbyes would be this easy so i stare at my tennis shoes still waiting for the day to come and cease me to used up to say "whats the use"  swallowing hard to keep from breathing with you as you spill onto me and maybe its not you but its the nighttime theres no place i would rather be.  refrain so lay out and look at the stars tell me all about how mars will be closer then ever before how TCM and A&E  changed the way you watched tv and how love isnt clear anymore  your jacket on, your arms crossed tight redefine the words "good night." and me me smile differently and i had to apoligize for making you think of other guys when i really want you to think of me.  verse 2  so i walk him home in the moonlight and sing small tributes to you how your voice changes when your honest how honesty will never do  so i come home the long way so i can clear my head some more and ive almost got it perfect but them im back at my door.  some nights are better then others.

      now this is a real post. i found this on    http://www.mrconsuelos.blogspot.com/  go.   I looked at a picture that we all had taken at Great America in April - May of 1999. It was me, Dave, The Brazilian Chick, my ex, Dan, Nikki, and the Corporal. It made me think of something that one of the Counselors told us at Scout Camp years ago. He said "Look around at the people you're with right now and remember them, because chances are you'll never all be together again." It's true. There is no way for that group of people ever to be together again. It works with most situations. People die and people leave. People fight and people fall out. It's a sad thing the human race. We're all born to die and I don't know how I feel about that. Everything always comes to a question of mortality with me. I wrote things where people die. It's almost the only thing that binds the people of the world; the fact that we're all dying. Life is not dumb luck, everyone has a choice to live and die. Choices you made yesterday could affect whether tomorrow you die or not. . . I guess it is dumb luck, but not in whether or not you die, rather in whether or not you make the right choices in your life. Some people don't and they die young. How fucked would it be if life was just a maze, and we were these animals chosen to run it? That chases me to two conclusions: A) When we make the proper turns and find the right course and find the cheese we are taken away from the maze, we die, or B) When we make the wrong turn it is believed we can longer find and the cheese and thus we die. It's strange. What kind of person am I? Do I believe that only the good die young, they "find the cheese" or do I believe the dead have only run out of chances and are removed by will? What about old people? I think maybe sometimes it's a little of both. You can only make the right choices so often. Eventually you have to make a mistake. Other times it just takes that long.  Then again . . .  What if things you do in your life matter in the lives of other people? What if my decision to eat a piece of cake at a restaurant, causes them to run out of cake, causing a person not to be able to eat dessert and then leave early, causing the oncoming traffic not to see their black sedan, causing the death of one or more people. What about that guy that sold that person the black car? I don't even want to think about how my choices affect those around me. It's hard enough knowing that my choices will affect me. Life is so bogus, I don't even know if I can handle doing anything the rest of my life, but then what about all the people I may help later.   I guess the only real conclusion that I can think of is just to make smart choices that won't end up killing me, and hopefully, I'll stay out of everyone else's way.

       if you cant even look me in the eyes then whats the point of lieing anyway? and if i cant tell you that you need to know that saturday is just like everyday  you wake up to feel everyone is gone and nothings ever going to be the same and the world is not like lryics in the songs you sing, places stay the people always change  refrain  run off and hide cause youve got nothing to lose except longitude your falling apart and im not even in the state sit back and wait for someone to come and make things feel the way they did today and talk about smoking and drinking coffee black  well im never coming back  verse 2  if my opions arent worth much why do you ask me what i think? and you say i waste my life sometimes why do you sit around and drink?  and i cant help but feel apart from everyword your struggle on because i dont see it in the end because i know that youll be gone ---------------------------------------------------   so you capture me in a photograph thats when i know that im your past and youll just grow up and leave me behind  and we pledge aliegence to ourselves because we feel like no one else and no one ever shook hands with a flag  in your ratty clothes in my front yard you tell me that i went to far but feeling tired is nothing next to drained  so we close ourselves off to the light and try to kiss shadows goodnight because i cant help felling im to blame  --------------------------   if i never get home ill be happy alone  in the street and punk rock boys spend more on their hair then cds.

       the last thing i want from my blog is something to make you laugh. but jack handey. is the funniest man alive. just look   Even though he was an enemy of mine, I had to admit that what he had accomplished was a brilliant piece of strategy. First, he punched me, then he kicked me, then he punched me again.

      i just want everyone to know. that life keeps getting better. or at least it should. and if it doesnt. then it will soon. optimisim is a drug. but pessimism is a disease. i dont know.  if you go to this website you can get to hear the first 7 songs from the new weakerthans cd. oh man. its sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo  good.  http://www.epitaph.com/goodies/ecard.php?id=262  just copy and paste. and enjoy.  but id like to tell you all things about my life. and the fact that everyone i know is in bed is comforting.  im in love with steff. and i guess thats weird to put up on the blog. but i do love her. and if you dont know. you should. and it doesnt mean that i wont like other girls. and thats what confuses people.  how can you love someone but not "like" them. i dont know. its like family. except if i want to like her i can. see i got it sweet. and same goes for you steff.  thats about all. the weakerthans new songs have cheered me up soo much. i was pissed cause kazaa jerks werent giving me songs. and i was just soo mad. but this is way better than any songs i might want to find or something. i dont know.  i would try to write a song. but john k sampson kills it.

      i had a fine night.  i watched   all the real girls.   just go watch it. and try to fall in love. thats all i can ask.  all i want is to sit next to someone on a curb and not have to say anything to them. and know that they dont care if i do or dont. and thats enough for both of us.

      so heres the message. and the story to back yourself up. if you dont do all you can for those you love. you havent done anything  when we lived in georgia the second time. i had a dog named sampson. and he loved me and i loved him. and i would play with him every day. and he would play with me and let me pet him and sit with him and run around with him. and everyday we played. well sampson came down with heart worms. which kills dogs. so we tried to save him.but he was getting sicker and sicker and just not healing.   but everyday sampson got up and played with me and ran around all day and killed himself for me and i didnt even know it. because i would fall asleep. but he would wheez all night on the stairs. and then get up to play with me all the next day. and i wish i would have known then that he was in pain. and i was with him when we put him to sleep. i was there to watch him die. to see that we are all going to die. but everyday. he got up. for me.   so everday. i will get up for you.

Don't cry no more Found out what his heart is beating for Says he takes it much too hard Give my regards to B.J.

      i woke up at 8 to go to church. and the sermon conflicted with my interpritaiton of the reading. but no one would listen to me about it. no one cares. and its funny, because my ideas were alot more christian and happy then the other crap that the priest was saying. and then we saw urlakis cause we got us some mickey ds breakfast which was totally sweet. then i laid around for sooo soooo soooo long. and then i talked to some friends. learned some chords. then meg and her friend shelia came over and we all just played songs and stuff it was a nice day. im listening to goddamit. its a good good cd.  Caught myself on the side of the road Looking at shattered glass Watching for the signs of snow To pass  Winter blankets all we love Makes pages go to white So I can change all that ive done The world is mine to write  Refrain And your going to know when I give up  Because youll see  That everything you’ve ever said  I believe Were all just parts of a puzzle  We cant fix And the earth is about as round As bricks  Verse 2  Tried on that old fake smile That I always used to wear And it didn’t fit for a little while But I think im getting there  And this whole world is making me Feel stupid and alone And its hard to shake it when Your never home

And all the times you were wrong And all the times I was right Did it feel good  To keep winning the fight Because it didn’t tonight  Verse 2 Im checking my watch thought you might have called me by now Its past nine o clock I feel like I just should step out And think I missed your call instead of you never called me But im too scared to call you is this a game of hipocricy?  Verse 3 Im making my way up to your house but your not awake Im feeling the oxygen slip out of all the world with breaths I take So I stand in your back yard and watch the fog roll in the park There was I time when I thought that maybe at five o clock its dark

      aight.  i went on a snack run. and came back with tootsie rolls and pistacios. it was weird.   youve got you wallet tucked inside your jeans and its like me it only comes out to get used then you put it back away when your through with the games you play but im soo happy that im close to you  and the world keeps moving back and forht with stories told on your front porch and meaning getting lost along the way so you put your ear to the ground too see if sadness is coming around and if it is i hope that its today.  and childhood fears fill up the rooms of all the shrinks we will go to who wil tell us that it isnt our faults and if its not i hope to hell that he has a name that he can tell  me so i can slash the tires on that guys car  and feeling petty keeps me dry when spring time comes you wonder why im not the only one still wearing white. in a spanish class you made your speech. and i saw you out on the streets  and does it matter about my shoes tonight.  so carve your self a little nitche where you can live and if i bitch just tell me that your happy wiht your life and i sit and look at the river with some guys and we forgive her for getting everything right.  and somenights move like shopping carts with wheels that turn or refuse to start but we keep pushing anway in hope that maybe things will change or at least not stay the same as they have been every other day  you keep the light on in your room and hope that he might come for you tonight because you really love him still with heavy eylids and a heavy heart the beginning always has to start  with you feeling alone at your window sill  i catch myself calling your house and i know that you are out but some habits are just to hard to break so you keep looking at my eyes and trying not to see the skies that turn black with every breath we take  so you light up your cigarette and tell me that you want to quit and that you only do it when your not at home as you put the fire out with the street you stop and you look up at me and ask me if ive ever been alone  and you just sing the same sad song that youve been singing all along the lyrics only change because they can and i try not to let you see how much you really mean to me until i play my song over again  and calling in sick is all we do when i really want see you i know that you will do it for me forget your job forget your life. it all adds up to one more time that you dont have to prove anything

      alright. how to deal was good. at least in the sense that it wasnt bad. i then came home and hung out with steff for a while and then hit the downtown with hollywood and t money and we just hung around and met some girls that we just talked to and watched smoke. and this dude played a girl a john mayer song then got her phone number. it was awesome. the weird thing is everyone wants to meet people downtown and everybody is all like talking and talking and talking. its just funny. because we havent had a single conversation started under good terms. everybody is like. what. and were like. nothing dude. chill out. and then we talk to the people for however long. until we or they leave. and sometimes they come back and leave again.   but it was alright.  room to bleed.  by ben lee is the best song ive heard all summer so far. sorry weakerthans. but this song is way way way good. he can write them.  i will put up songs when im not listening to music so i can write.

      alright. so i woke up at 12ish. i wanted to wake up later because i wasnt going to do anything until at least 3. so anyways. i went to the orthodontist and picked up bill on the way. the promise of adventure and right said fred got him into the car. i got some new rubberbands but thats not really interesting. i laid around my house for a while. then margret called me and her and i went to best buy and i bought the new ben lee cd. we walked around the store for a while talking about songs and stuff. it was nice. and we threw the top back on the shadow. which means its a party. i hung out with don in the night and we had us some good chats. girls, life, art, modern art, poetry, swimming, books. it was a good chat. that lasted at least 2 hours.  i saw steff for a second. and then for a few more seconds later. i hope she feels really guilty. i was laying a huge guilt trip on her. but it was nice to see her. and she was scoping out my 9 days longer hair. all goo goo eyes and stuff. it was nice. and john and i are working on a colaboration for buck wilder. it should be great.    If you want what’s best then you will go Don’t look back it will hurt to watch you smile Ive seen a lot and now I know  There are things in this life worse then denial Im making the most of what I got A beating heart and a pen that’s running dry You want to be something your not And I just want to be alive  refrain So I cross the street and I feel my feet Beating on the concrete Stepping on my soul its all that I have Its all that I need I wrote you a song but it is more About me And you’ve always been too blind  To see  I breath in air and try to think About the world that we are living in And thers a park at the end of the street Where I got to see my childhood begin But now I just hang out on the swings And talk to him about all of the shit That being 16 brings And why we always put ourselves in it  I make my way back to my house’ Letting the night wash over me And if you would just step out Of your life you might be able to see How picuters find us at our best And try to capture us at our worst And there a whole world full of the rest Of people who sings songs you’ve never heard  more songs later i hope

      if any of you checked the blog more then once today and saw nothing new and got pissed. im certainly sorry. so where was i????  i woke up to the lovely voice of chris on the phone. screaming wake up. its 2 pm. so we played 2 man ultimate at lincoln. and then we played volleyball with theresa and tracy benjamin. if thats how you spell it. so i went home and watched some last comic standing and took a shower and all that stuff. ate some pretzles. the usual.  so anyways. we went out to chiles with vasich and that was really quite fun and we went to see american wedding. it was funny in a sad sense. that one kid keeps wanting to get with stifflers mom and he keeps going back to her and liking her. jeez what an idiot? haha  sorry. if you can check out hayes blog he poured his heart out and i liked reading it. he may not have quoted me directly but it was pretty close so if you want to chekc that mofo.  heres what im really wondering about. i cant tell if im enjoying life or just creating memories. do we all do that or what. i dont know if its just me. when i think about doing things. im like.well think of how funny it will be when i run into my old friends. and we laugh about the pond or tonys birtday party. i dont know. i guess its fun. i just wish everyone could see all sides of me instead of just the stuff that i put up. so at least for a little while i will put up something embarrassing.   soo. i wrote a song that made me actually cry last week.    and i cant post it up here. because its not right. so just chill and someday you might hear it.  but something new.  im giving into a mood that keeps washing on me and we avoided the eyes that were to anxious to see and you reached out for my hand and i was moved by the touch and it was to say goodbye that shouldnt matter to much.  refrain but ive been hurting myself for soo long. and ive been making problems just to be strong. and you keep telling me truths that feel soo wrong and i feel like i am just along for the ride  verse 2 its past eleven and im on my way home sitting next to you because you make me fell alone and your soo distant because you want me to love her i already do but im telling you nothings for sure  verse 3 so we talk about it as if it were on tv not a story of love but a story of the way things should be with my hands in my hair trying to figure out what i already know im always going be the one to fall in love with whoever will show   cool cool. i like that song

      my crappy headphones are losing all good on me. i wear them at the computer so that my music doesnt keep the family up. and the left ear piece doesnt work. and the cord isnt long enough. sorry to complain. its been a good good night. and i enjoyed it alot. hollywood pat and i made some good memories. chris vasich isback in town until sunday. soo oooooo boy. i cant wait to see him tomarrow. it will be like seeing and angel from heaven. pete is going to start a blog soo i think so i will send a link out to you guys when that goes down. that will be like reading my blog only a year younger and more exciting.  poetry positive revolution. god bless you weakerthans  heres the new song im working on called SORRY FOR THE NIGHT I GOT ALL WIERD AND RAN AROUND YOUR POND AND THREW YOUR CHAIR OFF THE DECK THEN GOT ALL TECHNO NAKED IN YOUR GARAGE.  im walking to your house wiht a feeling that i dont want to be anywhere with anyone who knows about me and i play my songs on your back porch to whoevers there and wonder if thier listening i wonder if they care  refrain and im sorry for the night i went crazy at your house i had to many problems i just had to let them out im sorry that i therw that chair off of your patio im not sure if it broke i still dont know.  and when all of life is like a fairytale but happy endings never come im stuck in that part where im just joan of arc fighting my battles way to young so we sit and talk on your porch swing about what could have been and i look at a sideways sky and let her get under my skin  so i take my shirt of in your front yard and start to dance around to the techno beat i move my feet to some party bumping sounds and we talk alot about sexuality and everything that we are scared to name and at least sometimes you can make your fears into everyones favorite game  but when i got home i had a feeling like i had wasted my night well and heaven doesnt come to those who never get up to ring the bell so i push myself through my front door and struggle out of my clothes and lay in bed and look up at the stars and feel thats how it goes.  ----------------------------------------  what a weird song huh if only you could answer me   your carring around a grudge for all the boys who left you then well im sorry but i cant make it better for you but i just want to tell you one thing "i am not them" and are you just trying hard  to lose me too  refrain and its one o clock but i cant go to bed with a song i wrote in teh back of my throat and a poem in my head  and by 2 o clock sleep wont come to me so il take the time to perfect my rhyme and say its more then poetry  verse2  and i am not as loyal as i swear that i will be my promises keep breaking as i make them but i can promise you one thing if you come out wiht me ill take all of your childish fears and shake them  verse 3 and i cant say that i will change the way i like to act if it doesnt fit within your guidelines because this is just what i do and you know that is a fact so please dont just waste my time   --------------------- he washes the windows and paints all the doors he scubs up the chalkboards and polishes floors the world keeps on moving and notices nothing hes done  he cuts the grass weekly makes sure it stays green and he takes out his mop to make sure the rooms clean and when he moves along we just think about the day we have begun   i dont know what that was.   ------------------------------  dont promise me anything you cant really give says a girl with blue eyes like the sea as i talk to a girl whos caught up in her troubles and her answers revolve around "me" and we talk about weekend and things we did in school and think about names that we made and its friday night i should have a coat she says as we both stand in the shade  of the 711 where we sit and talk you say you broke up wiht your boyfriend yesterday and you just feel soo alone id call  you on the phone but i dont knwo what i would say so i give you a hug as if that were enough  to make everythin in your life right and i tell you to come to the concert were thorwing and then i say goodnight  and i meet him outside of a book store we stop and talk about picking up girls and i tell him a bout the show we are throwing but hes is in another world and we talk about childhood and all that we wanted when base ball was more then enough to make your mom scream and to make the kids dream god those were the days before love.  and just because your pretty doesnt give you excuses to be rude to hollywood pat when he asks you questions you better just answer because this is where we are at. you lead the expedition expect us to follow well we have better things to do like going out sleeping waiting for tomarrow and that doenst depend on you  so with a little persuasion we talk to some girls who are honest with us righ away and we tell them our stories or that parts that are cool and they dont tell us to go away so we talk about music we talk about school stuff we talk about the scandals of the church and they seemed really cool and they were total nice and that is my night for what its worth

      the show was cool. the jimmy hats first song wasnt right on the money but once they got into the groove they blew me away. you can tell that everyone in that band is really diggin it and they are a blast to watch. mikey v screams his lungs out. its great. the other bands were intimidating. entropy is good. i love zubutus or however you spell it so i gotta like his band.  dan court and hollywood came with me up to the old 711 for some slurpees and we decided a night on the town was in order, so we went down to the downtown and walked around. we went to borders and i read hollywood a berenstien bears book which he really liked. and we me some girls that he knows. they were lame so we split up and met some cool girls. and i think of of them is coming to the 16th show. a boy can always hope.  heres what i hope. so i met this cool girl. i hope shes at home typing on her blog. i met this cool boy.  who even knows if she has one. not me.  if i write some songs tonight ill put them up.

      i just wrote some stuff that got erased because i went to a ghetto fab hair website.  so screw that.  worked with steve and b and g and mark on a movie  worked with joe and mike and neil on true july  and here is my thoughts put to some sort of rhyme  were driving fast on our way to buy cds were blaring rap is this how youll remember me with my face agaist the glass of the window to our car never caring where we are  ------------------------------------  please say your tired of the same old pattern that i keep falling into and please say that youd like me to grow up as i grow closer to you  and i know that love is hard to find especially today but if it gives you some piece of mind i wish you were here with me today  -------------------------- alright, im not feeling well but its fine. its not like i tell how i am. when i dont feel the need  okay, so you see me clear well thas fine, because i am here open books always have pages to read  so its late, but i dont want to sleep and i hate, this side of me but i know, that tomarrow is the same  as today. and its getting worse and he said, singing is a curse and i wish i could find a way to change  so tonight, when i go to bed i will write, what i should have said on a page. that i will throw away  and wake up, with a scrathy voice and a mind that says i have no choice and i know, that tomarrows saturday.  -------------  his tired head falls into his hands and he freezes right where he stands with a picture pounding in his brain its of her and he can not explain  hes telling stories to everyone  about the things he has done and his thoughts on politics and why hes feeling so sick  and all the titles of cds he  bought ------------------------------------------------  its a long drive home when you just cant talk to anyone who knows you like she does and you wish you would have thought to walk if she asked why you can always stall with because  ----------------------  i cant complete a thought but i want to complete you.

      i took this out of a letter i wrote to steff a sec ago. i wish you were here to tell me how dumb i am. and i wish that was enough to stop it. but it cant. and im dumb. and i keep doing things that dont help anything. you and i are almost exactly opposite. we think some waht the same on almost all things but act entirely differnt. i dont know what i can do with life. i want to be something better then me. i want everything. i just want to fall asleep and not dread.  i dont know. if you cant tell by now. its obvious that mike likes theresa again. if it hasnt been obvious forever. god im such an idiot. but here we are. and im totally upset. and i want it to be like. in a year or two it wont matter. but the real issue is. in a year or two it wont matter if i dont make it matter now. in a year or two it might still matter. i dont know. im being dumb.  but  everything is fine. and i told her i love her. and then i told her i didnt. because i dont know if i do. but if love feels anything like this i would be totally content with it.  thats a big enough piece of the letter.  and now i would like to write a whole huge entry into this blog so that i can look at it and see something ive created that is sure to befull of contradictions and everything that i hate. so here is a breif history of time  it starts a week before easter i realize i like theresa. more then before. it had happed a few time but i shrugged it off. i tell her i like her the day after taht or something close. we talk alot.  and we talk more and we eventually decide to date. we dat for a few days easter i call her up and break up with her on her familys answering machine 3 minutes later i call her and attempt to get back together with her on her familys answering machine. we talk alot. about everything. i messed up. she decideds that we shouldnt date again. i agree. or at least. i must have i write a song. its about her. i keep writing and rewriting  no what the fuck am i doing with this post.  its just going to embarress her. see. im soo inconsiderate, but i dont edit posts. i dont even fix typos. i cant do anything right. and all i want to do is amke her happy and here is waht  i do. all the thanks she gets for all this crap.  i dont deserve this girl. i creat problems and then try to be strong as i struggle through them. i dont deserve a second chance. and that alone makes me want to cry. just to give up on myself. but i dont because i wonder if i will get another one. and that wondering keeps me moving. keeps me living. and were all just waiting for me to find a new girl. because thats what i do. because i dont really care about anyone but myself right? right? right?  i cant control what i do to people. but i can i dont want to . i dont know what. i wish you didnt all haveto read this because my sanity is in question.  but i cant change can i. i cant be what she needs. can i be what anyone needs? can i write a whole post feeling sorry for myself yes.  i spend too much time talking to guys about what they want in a girl.and i tell them what i want. and i just dont know. its too much. because its hardly anything  all i really want is someone to challenge me  i want to attempt to start a running race with someone. and then they will say no. and i will look down at my feet in typical fashion after getting my idea shot down. and then they will say go and get a huge head start and i will be upset about it and run as hard as i can after them. and maybe i wont catch them. but who knows.  thats what im looking for in a girl.   i guess its up to that first girl who is ready to say  GO.

      TRUE JULY.  we did some recording today for the film and it was alot of fun. i think every shot in the movie i will have a sweaty sweaty back. but thats not waht i want to talk about. i want to talk about the converstion from being a middle american boy or girl to some straightedge punk or punkette. its all dumb so here is how it happend for me. and ill try to think of how it happened for you.  i was born. i liked what my parents had on the radio. i listened to billy joel all the time. and they might be giants and that was all i listened to. james and joe would play other stuff in the car but when i got to my room. i put on THEN or GLASS HOUSE.  and then one day james decided there was a problem there. and he came into my room with his hands full of compilation cds. and he said. "mikey, listen to these find bands you like and ill try to get you some cds of these bands" so i did. and i only realy liked bands that sang fast had smart songs and didnt swear. so out of the whole punk scene this is maybe 3 or 4 bands. but i likd these bands and grew to like other bands. and some of these bands talked about kids i saw at school and how their lives were misdirected or something like that. and i was just an impressionable kid. and i was like yeah. these kids arent smart. their lives are governed by brittany spears and sweater vests. and possibly those pens with feathers on the top. and thats when i said forget this.  i had started skating too so my sense of fashion changed a little bit. and slowly but surely i became one of my junior highs only punks if thats what i was. i remeber giving cds to kids to have them see if they liked the bands i liked. the only other person in junior high who had tastes even close to me and the only other punk in the whole place was randy k.  everyone else said. yeah im punk. blink 182 rulez. and they spelt it with a z like that. and i just wanted to scream your not punk.  WELL IM NOT PUNK.  and this is where the really issue comes in. im not punk. i enjoy some punk but there is alot of better stuff out there as far as i am concerned. and here is waht i was thinking.  and i mean alot of offense to anyone who fits in these catagories.  FIRSTLY. the uneducated metal heads. i know alot of kids who like metal music and are pleanty smart. but to anyone who walkes around with an ICP shirt or a slipknot shirt i say this to you. You are not smart. and you dont know good music. and you perfer to say things like you dont understand my music to your parents. and when they tell you its too loud you say no its not . your to old. and then you fight and slam your door. well do you know what they are saying. is the music changing your life? should it? if it makes you feel good do it. but dont expect respect from me because i think its all an act for most of you.  and if you have a shirt that says ill only wear black until they invent something darker. you arent cool.   SECondly. the i wasnt pretty enough for popular boys so now im punk girls. you know who you are. so wear shirts of bands you dont really listen to i dont care. and you know waht. the punk community can have you. infact. if they wont take you. you might as well just sign your I HATE MEN club forms and join right away. but this isnt to say that all girls who like punk and cool music arent cool. because there are some girls who like itfor the music. these girls fit into a different catagory.  GIRLS i want to marry these are the girls. that like the bands i listen to and are cool about it. and dont complain about dumb things. and are solid gold.  im sure theres alot of other people that dont fit into these groups. be happy. i dont htink any of them end up too happy in life. so go out and buy billy joels glass house or some they might be giants cd. because life is really really good then. and you dont have to deal with these groups. and if you fit into any of these groups and are mad at me.  im sorry. im just saying it the way i see it. and if your in the first group. please dont stab me with the spikes off the dog collar around your neck. and if you walk into classes late wearing a shrit saying keep staring i might do a trick. you are not a cool person. and i dont think taht anyone will ever understand you.

      LAST NIGHT WAS THE FIRST NIGHT  that i didnt have a late night blog posting but i was over at Grichs playing some late night high stakes pingpong and doing some late night low stakes discussion with greg and steve. we talked about a lot of stuff and most of the night was passed laughing and joking around about our days. To put it simply steve took her back. and that made me a little upset. after a girl tells you you bore her, i say send her packing. but i trust steve to make the right decision this time. BECAUSE HES DIFFERENT THIS TIME? but we talked about storys of love and loss. and about school and the classes we owned and what ever happened to baby b? we had some good times. and g rich whenever he felt the conversation drifting would ask us if we had done any mackin? needless to say it was a very nice night that i enjoyed. but since i came home at 1 and promised id be home at 12 i must clean teh garage soon. also mikeytypewriters car is in the driveway. so i cant wait.  i didnt get to write anything because i was at a sleepover.  love mike

Yellow: Someone you will never forget  i said vasich Orange: Someone you consider your true friend i said mom Red: Someone that you really love i said urlakis White: Your twin soul i said steff Green: Someone that you will remember for the rest of your life i said randy  and then it wanted me to send it to 26 other people. i said no way in heck. im sorry but that seems like alot of people. it was interesting though and i learned a little bit. i dont think career comes before anything though. because i dont care about jobs or anything like that. there was no doubt what would be on top.  well i hope i havent ruined this test for you if you didnt take it yet. but if i did im truly sorry.  and i guess. if 26 of you do it off of this i will get good luck. i didnt want my wish to come true anyways. how sad is that.  st kevin. you and your cross my friend. someday. someday.

      SISTERS BROTHERS MAKE BETTER LOVERS A FAMILY AFFAIR DOWN UNDER THE COVERS  ive been feelings pretty good today. not to say that yesterday was a bad day or the day before it. i woke up to go to church and spent alot of my time thinking about the band stop drop and rock. i just think thats one of the most clever names of all times.  i looked through a bunch of my old and baby stuff. i was a cutie i swear. congress sent my mom a letter to congratulate her on my birth. im telling you. i was a special kid. i wrote a story about my trip to california and it was supposed to be about some of the struggles or something. the assignment wasnt clear. but my whole thing was about my pet hen and how it died and how i never felt happiness again. i was dark back then. and i found a mothers day card where i told my mom she was.  "the best in the west"  i looked through a ton of old photos and came across some of the best dog that ever lived.   cinder. my goodness if you didnt get the chance to meet cinder then you didnt get a chance to live.    i got home as the sun was setting too many things getting in my way with your eyes seeing lies for beauty and myself faking everything  a long day with a longer evening making me feel like an astronaut floating around but never really seeing where im going or where ive gone  refrain and its another day like the others where we dont want to get out of the covers to face a chilly floor and a creaky door that leads us to the world  verse 2 and you speak like your only dreaming not really saying a single word and i dont know what your meaning or if theres something i should have heard  and i walk like a drunken dancer full of grace but a little off and you say why cant you just ask her but i say its because  i am so lost  verse 3  and i sing like a broken juke box spilling out songs that are old and used and you say that you dont even hear them and you blush cause theyre all about you  and i talk like a tired traveller full of stories no one wants to hear and i know that i cant have her  but its enough to have here there  i like that song. some people thought it was sad. but i dont know. theres some hope in it.  enemy--this idea that i always need an enemy.  its tired and used  i hope you know i love you. or at least like you alot.

      I AM SOO OUT OF TUNE WITH YOU  i cant begin to explain myself to anyone ever. life keeps moving on and i finished enders game. for the second time it was even better. i caught alot of things i didnt notice at first. as much as its about battle and space there is alot of self exploartion and a sense of duty. which i feel is very necessary. steff packed up to leave today. i guess its different being the one home. god knows it always me who packs up to go. my father and my uncle just left on the motorcycles for sturgis. its in the dakotas. its a huge bike rally. its weird. i feel like i dont miss him enough. hes been working alot these days all aroudn the usa and england. i just miss him sometimes. but he knows i love him and i know he loves me so its alright. i woke up at ten and steff came over because i had to give her some eels for the trip. if you still havent heard them you should. and ill hook you up if thats what you want.  tony sent me this after reading yesterdays blog post. i thought it was very insightful.   a lil advice, things are the way they are for a reason, no coincidencidences, but rather the choices u make are for a reason, so i feel u should never regret ne choices in your life b.c its to long and how do u know u made the wrong decison.  i really liked this and im glad that people are out there ready to help anyone for any reason. it gives me more faith in humanity. i have always had some because i know some amazing people. but this just seals it. the world isnt as screwed up as we all thought.  the platinum players are going to record at mike urlakis's studio today. it should be a blast. i was working on some stuff with rosa last night. a few rhymes. its all good stuff.  THE PAPERBACKS are coming up as one of my favorite bands of all time.  Whitehorse.  I drove to Whitehorse to see my dad before he died; I didn't make it there in time. So now I'm sleeping in my shoes in the rooom where I grew up beside a stack of papers I have to sign. Surrounded by toys and trophies, a star chart glowing on the wall...calling you up every hour and hanging up when our machine goes off. Oh...I wish you had come with me. If I ever had a kid, and the odds of that are slim, I can't imagine that he or she would do anything but tolerate my love (in congress with my own timid transactions) and ration theirs accordingly. And if a day comes when they're called back to sift through the few things I've left, they'd probably be subject to this same numbness, this same unfocused emptiness. Oh...I wish you had come with me. But all I can do now is dial up your creaky, recorded voice, which cheerily informs me that no one is home, that I'm alone, that I've sleepwalked through it all, my childhood, this call, and, now that it's too late, I wish...I wish you had come with me.  they are awesome i have to send away for the cd. i think i want to do that today.  those lyrics alone have me hooked and i have heard 5 songs by them.  you think i got it all going my way then why am i such a fucking mess? 3 speed. the eels.  i cant complete a thought this early  i looked up at the sky last night and i thought i saw a bomb why wont you just tell me whats going on?  alright now to say something. i was watching made today about a girl who wanted to be a pro bmxer. its was pretty cool and she ended up doing a backflip which was really cool. but it just made me see that you cant achieve some of your dreams unless your on a show. this girl would have never been MADE had she not sent in a tape. i love the show dont get me wrong. its really interesting and fun to watch. all her friends were being whiny babies and she broke up with her boyfriend during the filming. but you know. there are dreams and their are friends. and i know that sounds bleak. but ifyou have to make a choice. it doesnt seem hard. you can always make new friends. and i hope none of you take this the wrong way. because i consider us friends. but if any dreams started coming true and i had to dump your ass. i just might. and i hope you would do the same to me. i would understand.   well i have to work on raps and stuff. so i love you. and please if your reading this before 5 go out and do something cool with someon you think is cool. or tell someone you love that you love them. because no body hears that enough.

      THE WORLD HAS TURNED AND LEFT ME HERE  that is how i feel right now. everything is catching on fire around me. and i watch my world smash to bits all i want is someone i can share all this mess with. and thast dumb. isnt it? i really dont know anymore. no one can see why it means soo much to me to have someone. because i cant call you. and i dont call you to talk about my day. and sometimes we only see eachother when im sad. and im sad too often. and i want to see you to see you not to have you boost my confidence in things that im not really proud of. and its pointless for me to argue both sides in any situation. i just see too manythings that remind me of the past and how much i didnt like alot of it. there was a girl that i thought was cool and wanted to hang out wiht and we always smiled at each other in the halls. and at the end of the school year we talked a little or whatever. and i saw her tonight for the first time this summer. and it took us at least an hour of silence before we would say antying to each other. and even then it was about our hair. she asked me if i did something to it. i explained that i hadnt cut it.  so i asked her if she did something with her hair. she had bangs now. i dont know if that means anything to you. i dont know. we just kind of sat and and didnt talk and sometimes i caught her eye and sometimes i didnt. i dont know what to do about that. and i dont really care to much. i just want something. and i hate to wonder if she is it what am i supposed to do. thats my biggest problem. what if she is it. what if you reading this are it. boy or girl. i dont know. what if anything is it? thats my problem thats what i wonder. and the earth is off its axis i feel like space is waiting for me. and life is just getting harder. my brothers are going to be gone soon. and i dont want that. ill miss james soo much. you get used to having someone around. and from all the moving we did as kids. i always had james. and there have been alot of times when i have hated him. but i love him. and care for him. i remeber one time i told him i didnt respect him. and i meant it. how messed up is that. your 12 or however old he was. and he had to hear it from his little brother. and i can never forgive myself for that. never. because i said it and i meant it. and i wanted to hurt him so he wouldnt have to hurt me. and it worked. and i dont know what to think of it.    i hate writing that im out of control because it makes me think that i am out of control. when i read the perks of being a wallflower i admired charlie for letting people be happy before him. and i hadnt finished the book but i went and gave joe and james the last ice cream. and then i finished the book and was like hey. it didnt work.  i miss the way i was. and i wonder what i would be like if i had just started drinking or smoking or not writing songs.   what would you change about yourself  wouldnt be depressed all the time id be stronger.. emotionally prolly my appearance i wouldnt be myself to think before i speak  these are all answers i got  if i could change on thing about myself i wouldnt want the things i want. i would be happy with the little things i get and not keep longing for more. but i do want more. and i would change that if i could. and i wouldnt let looks change anything about a person.  i would come right out and say that i am shallow but i dont now if i am shallow shallow. i guess i promised not to hold anything back from you. sometimes i feel shallow and sometiems i dont. everyone looks at people. and some of us judge based first on appearence. that doesnt mean that that is my final call but alot of times it is my first call. and that isnt right and i would change that also.  so if you ever feel like your being judged based on your looks and im around. punch me in the face. because its probably me doing it. and im truly sorry for it. and its something that i try not to let get in the way of friendships. because beauty is skin deep. but tired cliches go all the way to the bone.

      im just tired. tired to the center of my being. tired the way that soldiers must be tired after they go through a whole day of battle. i just want to hit and pillow and disappear into night and never wake up. but thats not what im doing. if you really want to know or care how the show went go see hayes blog. it was alot of fun. and i guess some people didnt like my antics. but i guess i cant please anyone any of the time.  i woke up to a phone call again i think. or fishlights or something. it was a weird morning. i just read some enders game and took a shower and waited for steff to pick me up for the show. we went had a good time and everyone just kind of liked it. it was really rainy and weird outside. but it was alright.  i had one of those days. where i was waiting for something to happen.   the first words i said this month was rabbits rabbits rabbits so i have good luck according to vasich. so thats cool. im waiting for my luck to just roll its way on in.  steff leaves tomarrow for nine days. thats a pretty long time. i guess ill have to make some new friends or something.  i sat next to john mcdunagh?? for a while at the show and after not saying anything i said. i guess what i really want is for someone to hold me. he said huh. and i said nothing.   -------------------  i need to wake up from antoher bad dream where we sit and we dont say a thing as i stare at my watch until my time is up and i leave nothing more then a cup  that is empty and broken and tired and sad just like the conversation that we might have had if i just had the time to take time for granted and you could start seeing the world as i planned it.  refain.  i just want to lay down  and fall asleep because your piece of mind is not a piece of me  verse 2 i need to just get out of here take the red eye to anywhere i dont need to back my bags there is nothing her for me except some broken dreams and a whole lot of irony  i cant help but feel im not okay with all the stupid things i want to say and i walk around wondering where i should go because there is really nothing to do at home  i dont know what this means if it means anything  enemy---fatigue.  something old. someday ill put up the paper i wrote a bout a girl i know. old.

      you once said if romance was alive you hoped it would kill you and a kid in a shirt promoting australia said how weird normal people were but i bet he was a kid once. when his hair was shorter when he wasnt trying to impress the oddly pretty girl he walked with there was a time when i said i didnt care what they thought when my music could seperate me and words meant more then looks. eyes cant penatrate your soul you told me then you looked at me "you still love her" they say and i say "no" "why not" they plead hoping its true  if i told you all why i wouldnt be better then that so i listen to them talk about a party. 3 kegs can make a night better and the music plays "i could have been someone, well soo could anyone" the pouges fill me with it. and i try not to die  in the springtime. the winter fills my chest with false starts and coughs id get a ride from him tomorrow but it didnt feel right. i felt like i was being recorded.

      the poetry kept escaping me on a long drive back to town he had said it better then i ever could without ever using a mouth and pens refused to write for me for fear that they would bleed something that would discrace them so all they gave me was answers to a chemistry sheet i put off  and my voice it keeps escaping me as i scrath my way to songs and my knuckles crack with the force of trying to make her smile and you kept dreaming while i stayed up and if your dreams were about me maybe i could fall to sleep again

      so she walked into the room and checked her watch. she had never checked her watch until she met him. time suddenly seemed very important to her. she met him at the bottom of the stairs and found herself rolling her eyes at the way he looked. He had on a t shirt from a band she hated and there were holes in his jeans at the knee. for a moment he reminded her of that kid from clarissa explains it all. here he was pushing a latter up to her window and all she wanted to do was push it away. she wanted space but what she had was him. so she hung her head and walked with him to her class. he tried to kiss her at the door to the class but she pushed him away and said the teacher was watching. it didnt matter if it was true or not anymore. he walked through the hall and wonderd whats wrong with her? she sat in class and wondered what was wrong with her. They still dated and talked when the silence was too much to bear. and she sometimes made him cds to listen to and  he sometimes wrote her notes. and they sometimes felt love.

      she got her first letter the day the snow shone off the ice on the  lonely walk home and she opened it up as she laid on her bed with no pillow to sleep with her head   she smiled at what he wrote but didnt agree "no one could ever feel that way about  me" and she closed her eyes and in attemp to pretend that she knows whos behind the pen  refrain  if it was me, that loved you like that id give you my heart, just soo you could give it right back and if it was me i would not need you all of my words, would do  verse 2  he got his first letter from her back in april but  threw it away just like any old paper its wasnt a heart to him it wasnt anything  that he really wanted to see  and he dug through the trash about a week later to find what she wrote and to try not to hate her for caring soo much about him  when he didnt give a damn

      Im writing you from the basement of chris brian vasich. ist pretty cool to be over here and hes off at work. i want to do some writing but i dont know if i can in such a foreign place. i saw a movie about fugazi that was awesome   ballad of a late night at a bus station in kentucky  you said the only one who ever understands keeps drowning in puddles while you walk and you never get to hold onto their hand and you seldom get to see them sleep or talk  and the only time your really close to them is when your laying on your chest out on the dock watching the waves move up to the sand knowing growing ups around the block  refrain but if i dont read between the lines  then stories are just words and if you can say your doing fine ill forget all that i heard and if you stop taking things so wrong then i mihgt  let it go but the days we live could become our lives and theres still things that i dont know  verse 2 you say "the quickest way to die is to be lonely" but some of us cant ever be alone and "if someone ever took the chance to know me" then they would probably never be at home  and disastor strikes when everyones most careful so lets just sit and watch the storm roll in you can tell me all you have till i cant hear it and im just want  to sink while you all swim

      oh hey. it been a while since ive seen you around. i hope your not feeling sick or anything. the fall is coming and im enjoying it. i wish you could see the leaves change with me. but your way over there on the other side of the school this period. dreaming about anything but your classroom and me. and i cant watch the leaves change all i can watch is a nice boy fall asleep. and he lost tonight. i hope my teacher doesnt bring it up. or ask me why im soo distracted. its because you made a biggoted comment. and here i am. no better then the rest. i want to write a story. andi will soon. but ill settle for a song.   so you gave up on your diamond rings and  pretty things are soo disgusting and little girls are always trusting  me to be okay  and i compliment things you cant change and its soo strange its almost honest and i dont want to get down on my  knees but i will for you. -----------------------------------------------  not all storys have happy endings so stop pretending that your okay and all those girls keep making faces your out of place and your on display  so dont keep singing that lonesome poem we all know em anyways its the way you look at my shaking hands and you understand im here today  refrain to mess you up  --------------------------------  well it was a sunday night when i first thought that you could be the one sitting on the swings  the evening almost done  and you smiled at me and i could see the way that you could shine and the light hit off your hair i didnt care about the time.  refrain  dont ask for somethig from me that i cant realy give all i have is a heart and 6 strings and  reason to live but you always read my new songs and tell me how you feel and i meant it when i said "thank you for being real"

      i could arguably call this the best song ever written. god bless you mr waits.  I Don't Wanna Grow Up (Tom Waits/K. Brennan) When I'm lyin' in my bed at night I don't wanna grow up Nothin' ever seems to turn out right I don't wanna grow up How do you move in a world of fog That's always changing things Makes me wish that I could be a dog When I see the price that you pay I don't wanna grow up I don't ever wanna be that way I don't wanna grow up  Seems like folks turn into things That they'd never want The only thing to live for Is today... I'm gonna put a hole in my TV set I don't wanna grow up Open up the medicine chest And I don't wanna grow up I don't wanna have to shout it out I don't want my hair to fall out I don't wanna be filled with doubt I don't wanna be a good boy scout I don't wanna have to learn to count I don't wanna have the biggest amount I don't wanna grow up  Well when I see my parents fight I don't wanna grow up They all go out and drinking all night And I don't wanna grow up I'd rather stay here in my room Nothin' out there but sad and gloom I don't wanna live in a big old Tomb On Grand Street  When I see the 5 o'clock news I don't wanna grow up Comb their hair and shine their shoes I don't wanna grow up Stay around in my old hometown I don't wanna put no money down I don't wanna get me a big old loan Work them fingers to the bone I don't wanna float a broom Fall in love and get married then boom How the hell did I get here so soon I don't wanna grow up

      so here is the end to the story. if you didnt read the first part scroll down.  There are things you can hide from your parents. And things you can’t. Some kids get away with magazines they don’t want their parents to see, cigarettes, an occasional dirty video, or some pot. But no one can hide morning sickness and odd food cravings.  Christmas was just around the corner when he found out about the child. She was already 2 and a half months pregnant but not really showing. They talked less and less in class and when they did it was only about death or abortion. And these were whispered conversations. The kind that falls silent when someone else breathes. Suddenly the taboo was right in their faces. They had to make decisions to change their lives and suddenly they understood the after school specials. He thought of all that he could do for the child. And she told him what her parents had called her last night. They had grown out of the term “slut” and moved right on to “tramp.” Her tears were like apologizes to them. She knows she has done wrong they told themselves as the slowly lost their daughter. She is learning a lesson dear. She sure is. And he had a harder time smiling in the halls. And suddenly he wasn’t the guy who had slept with her. He was the guy who had gotten her pregnant. In a school as big as his was word travels fast. But whispers travel faster. He could always hear what they were saying as they hurried from class to class. He hardly made it to any classes on time. And when he walked in the door he just sat and did his work. He had a scholarship still and he needed to do the best for himself. And it hit him like a wave as he walked to school through the snow. “What am I going to do?” he finally realized the severity of the situation as he saw the park he had spent so much time cleaning. All that time for nothing.  	So he spent all his time thinking. When he wasn’t thinking about school he was thinking about the baby. And when he wasn’t thinking about the baby he was thinking about his future. Their future. His future. So winter turned to spring and spring into summer and the baby was due anytime soon. And he found himself waiting by the phone more and more. Because she had promised him she would call right as she went into labor because as the father of the baby he would be the one to take her to the hospital. He presented his case to her parents and they agreed that it was good of him to take the initiative. So on June 12 the phone rang and he picked it up already knowing that he needed to drive to her house right away. He climbed behind the wheel of his dad’s car and started off in the direction of her house doing 9 over the limit. She was waiting at her front door with a suitcase and he helped her into the car and put her suitcase in the trunk. He got back into the car and tried to start driving again. The engine revved but wouldn’t move. He looked frantically around to see what could be the matter, and then he realized it was still in park. So they drove around the block and up the way towards the hospital.  As the baby was born it was cleaned off and handed back to the mother. He sat and looked at what he had helped create. This was something in the world that was now because of him. He looked at the perfect hands and feet and little head of their son. He was filled with the kind of pride that only a drunk can feel. As the nurse handed the baby to him he held up his son and was in awe of his warmth. The nurse turned to talk to her and he took the child out the door. And he walked very fast all the way down the hall and right out the front door. He climbed into the car and held his baby in the crook of his right arm as he drove with his left. He couldn’t tell how long he was driving for but he needed to find the right spot. And then he saw it. An old green Cadillac with the windshield smashed and 3 of the 4 tires missing. To his surprise when he got up to it the doors were locked. He placed his child back into his car and wrapped a rag around his hand and punched with all his might into the window of the abandoned car. He felt bones in his hands break. His eyes became x-rays and he could see all the tiny shattered bones of his fingers. His knuckles were already starting to swell. He went into his trunk and pushed aside her suitcase. He found a tire iron and slammed it with all his might against the back left window of the car. Glass flew everywhere in a fireworks display and he reached to find the lock to get the door open. He walked calmly back to his car and carried the baby with him to the smashed out Cadillac. He kissed it once on the head and placed it into the backseat. He left a scrap of paper next to his son. It said Mark. 	He drove back to the hospital very slowly. She had promised to meet him at the coffee shop down the street. He didn’t know how she had gotten out of the hospital and how no one had stopped her on account of her gown. They didn’t talk about anything on the ride home. They had given them fake names at the hospital, you’d be surprised how little they need to know when your screaming about a baby on the way. They got ready and walked up the steps to her house. She was already crying as she reached the door, the same way that he would cry at the placebo grave of his child. He would stand up and place a single white rose next to the name of his child Mark Eric Crayford. And he would look at all his friends and then look back at the ground. In two weeks he was heading off to college and he was already starting to get packed. 	That’s the thing about kids these days. When they aren’t wanted they get left behind. It happens more then you think. All those forgotten ones.

      heres the story ive been working on.  He was born in the backseat of an abandoned car in the alley down from his house. At least that’s what everyone assumes. That’s where they found him. That’s the thing about kids these days. When they aren’t wanted they get left behind. It happens more then you think. All these missing children you read about. Well he was one of them. One of the forgotten ones. We have all seen the sides of the gumball machines and seen the pictures of the children. A little girl was last seen in 1992, chances are she has a new name and a new family. And how is she to know the difference? If you walk these streets and you ask around. No one really knows who they are anyways. Why should a name or a family change that? 	But everyone called him Ramada because he was found rapped up in a towel from the Ramada Inn. Everyone is always stealing them. If you check your own linen closet chances are you will find towels that don’t belong to you. And in a dirty towel in the backseat of a shot out car Mark Crayford found something that didn’t belong to him, a son. No one called the police anymore in that neighborhood. Why bother. They hated coming around to solve problems and this wasn’t a problem to anyone really. So Ramada grew up. On the same street as a meth lab and a notorious crack den that was knocked down 2 years after he left. But when your little you don’t see these problems and neither did he. You run barefoot through grass where addicts have passed out and puked and died. But you don’t know the troubles of this world, at least not yet. 	Ramada was on the fast track to success. He had a scholarship to a local school and was really trying to make a name for himself in the community. He had done hours and hours of community service painting buildings and picking up playgrounds in order to get the scholarship. He spent a whole summer adopting a road and keeping it clean. And everyone from his school would throw all their trash out the window on his street. He never had anytime to rest. By the time he finished picking up the end of his mile he had to walk back and start again to keep it clean. He struggled in his first two years of high school. He kept telling himself that he was better then all the other kids who kept making fun of him. It wasn’t his fault they picked on him. They were just jealous of him and all the great things he did for people in the community. So he walked through the halls and always exhaled at people who weren’t acting up to his standards. Every boy with a sideways cap he rolled his eyes at. Every girl that wouldn’t give him the time of day he rolled his eyes at. Every teacher that tried to hard to be hip he rolled his eyes at. And every teacher that wasn’t good enough for him he just stopped listening. So that’s how he spent his days at school. He hardly learned anything over his hatred for the other students who threw trash on his street and laughed at him and called him Ramada.  	But then she came along. He was sitting behind her in his math class and she turned around to ask him a question and he was enchanted. She had the kind of hair that makes a boy stop thinking. The kind of smile that makes frowns seem obsolete and the kind of eyes that never look at anything sad. And for the first time in years waking up was easy again. And the more he talked to her the more he saw her in the halls. Faces started sticking out again and the world started to shape. The constant blur of high school life slowed down for 50 minutes. The way she breathed changed the way he breathed. The way she leaned changed the way he leaned and he lived for that instant that the teacher stopped talking to see if she would turn around and talk to him. And the more they talked the more she laughed. And the more she laughed the easier it was for him to smile again. And picking up his street became a pleasure to him. It gave him time to think of things he would say to her if he ever got the courage. If he ever got a voice of his own. 	The one ultimate truth is that girls will never make it easy for the guys who like them. So he sat and wondered what things meant. Where those hints or just sentences? If she didn’t want him to know things about her why did she tell him everything? So he decided that it was time to find out for sure. So when she turned around he gathered all his courage, which seemed to be located somewhere foreign to him, and asked her if she would like to go to the next school dance with him. He face kind of fell but before she could let it she said sure. He was underwater for the rest of the day. He moved slow and breathed something he didn’t recognize. And suddenly she was talking to him all the time. She came and found him before school and sat next to him. And they ate lunch together and he didn’t miss the solitude. It was almost as if that hadn’t ever been a part of him. Erasing your past is probably the hardest thing you can try to do. 	For the first time in his life he was in a flower shop trying to find the right word for corsage. He kept saying that he needed a bracelet with flowers on it. And the lady looked down her strawberry nose at him and frowned. She had lines around her mouth showing that she didn’t smile often. And the whole place smelled like potpourri. It was choking him as he tried to think of what he needed and what color she said her dress was. As he stepped out into the open air he rejoiced in being able to breath in that familiar smell of gasoline and dying dreams. The smell of the city is intoxicating.  	They went to the dance with some of her friends and one of her guy friends had asked him to sleep over at his house after the dance. He decided that that would be fun so he said sure. He had never been to a school dance in all his years of high school. The whole school was decorated in the theme of the dance “Summer in the City.” He hated the theme. It didn’t even make sense. Not that any of them ever did. He wanted to punch whoever made this the topic of the dance. As he walked out onto the dance floor he realized that he had no idea how to dance. Sure he had learned a few things from gym class but kids weren’t dancing like that on the floor. It was an upright sexual free for all on the dance floor. Nothing was sacred as kids sweated a bumped into each other making fake sexy faces and pretended that this was fun. And for a minute he thought back to all these kids running through the grass in the park that he would later clean up. And here they were now. All grown up?  	He spent some of the evening on the dance floor but a lot of time getting drinks and trying not to sweat too much. He watched his watch and hoped the evening would end soon. As he held her close for the last dance he realized that this was what had been missing from his whole life. Contact. No one had ever held him this close and like this. And the music shifted into a feeling. And the lights turned into emotions and all the other kids on the crowded gym floor became sound waves. Floating next to him but not able to touch them. In a moment things were perfect. In an instant the world revolved around him. He didn’t know what love was. But if it was anything like this he would be content. 	They climbed into some kids mini van and drove to the after party. The kid driving was one of the guys you always see in the hall and always smile at but cant remember if his name is Eric or Jim or Dave or if he even has a name. And this Eric/Jim/Dave drove very fast all the way back to his house. And we pulled into his driveway and loosened our ties and got out of the car and all filed into his basement to hang out and talk. As most conversations in high school do this one progressed to sex. And one of these Eric/Jim/Dave’s brought up the idea of truth or dare. And so it began and it was at about 2 am that Ramada realized that the girls were spending the night. Of course it hit him for sure as his date was on top of him kissing him all over. She stopped briefly and asked him if he had ever been with a girl before? He looked at her and said no. She walked over to the Eric/Jim/Dave and whispered something in his ear. He smiled big and pointed to his right. She walked back and took Ramada by the hand off to the side. He woke up next to her in a sleeping bag with the top half of his body naked and freezing touching the exposed concrete of the basement floor. As he sat up his joints all screamed. He looked around at everyone else still asleep. And he remembered last night and what had happened. He put laid back down on the sleeping bag and watched as the exposed wires and pipes on the roof raced around it and found the right place to go into the other floors of the house.

      soo i havent told you anything for a while now. and i hope you arent let down by this fact. but my life hasnt been something that i can really talk about. i slept at matts last night and it was nice and crazy. i was watching bowling for columbine and then i realized the other two were asleep so i went to bed.  ---------------  i could close my mouth i could leave this town but it wouldnt change a thing i could write it down i could tell it twice but you wouldnt know what i mean i could scream it all through a microphone or i could sit and quietly sing but its getting late and i dont want to really dream  refrain so i dont know why i dont try to pick up my life and start again and you dont care if your going anywhere because you will get there in the end  verse 2  i could kill myself i could slit my throat and you wouldnt know why i died i could leave you all a big long note and everyone would still ask why and youd crowd around my coffin as you forced your self to cry while every ticking clock just told you lifes passing you by.   -------------------------  well where the ones who have it all but that just means its a bigger fall when we screw up when we let ourselves down  and we comb our hair and we brush our teeth and we drive our cars and we rush the streets and we drink the nights away or we go downtown  refrain  so give it up for the lucky one who never knew the pain of growing up in the working class or trying to explain how what you do is sort through screws in a factory all day. cause kids like us would just look away.  verse 2  so we buy new clothes and we go to school and we know where to go and we look soo cool and we never wonder where we ought to be  and we question god and authority and we punctuate punctuality and we fall asleep in front of the tv

      alright. i just want to say. that anything you think you cant fix with crazy glue. you can.  my camera had a crack in the housing and the battery was stuck in it. so i take it into wolf camera. and this guy is helping me out. and then his dick superior comes over and says something like "that would need to go to repairs. it will cost you 160 bucks and take 4  to 6 weeks. and the other guy kind of looked heart sick when he heard his jerk boss trying to seel me this thing for soo much to fix a tiny crack. and then the jerk was saying stuff like. you might get electrocuted since the battery is exposed. yeah right. if the battery was exposed i could have taken it out myself and i wouldnt have broght that into wolf camera. i dont like those guys. i wanted to go into there and have it be a total cool camera shop. with cool guys and dark lighting. but it was a bunch of guys in collared shirts. man. a camera shop should be really shady. and have to do with cameras. not a wall full of the bag that fits you as a person. does this shoulder strap make me look like an artist?? god its all so dumb. i guess im just being a complainer this evening but i havent done a long post in a long long time. and then i went to lipe and i think the braces might be coming off in just a few months. that will be weird. he just needs to fill a gap or two with his expertise and then im dope. the girl who works in his office is total nice. i was schedualing an appointment. and i said. whatever monday of next mothn. and she took the time to tel me that i have that day off school so i should enjoy myself and come another day. how nice is that? there was this girl at the show on saturday who i had never seen in school before but i saw her today. so that was nice. a nd we both just kind of looked at each other in odd. hey i saw you saturday looks. but i think thats teh best look you can get sometimes. i took 36 shots of close up things. i went into the garden and that was really cool. it was interesting out there. really odd stuff grows on leaves and things. but hopefully i did the assignment right. i think i did it well enough. ive got some homework but im also putting some off until later.  so i pick up the phone today and its the cops on the other end. asking for me. now i dont really do bad things but there has been a little skinny dippin and i guess thats trespassing. so i was nervous to pick it up and hear officer_________ say his name and tell me what it was all about. i get to be a part of a focus group. and i guess i get a soda and some gift certificate. soo i mean. thats awesome. and i get to sit around for what an hour and some minutes just to tell people what i think as your classic consumer. i think it has to do with the anti smoking campagin. god. i mean. i was bumming a smoke off a kid. just playing around with it not smoking it. and he got really mad. and said "you cant bum a square and not smoke it" a square. jeez. and his socks didnt match on purpose. i hate kids like that sometimes.   a girl in my class who is big into the whole. not pretty enough for boys so make yourself ugly deal. she was saying something about how there was a girl who was soo normal that it scared her. but shes just as normal as any girl in the school. shes just having trouble accepting it. its dumb for anyone to think they are different from anyone else. its just a degree of seperation we dont need.  and i mean. i hate people. but its not the person. i guess i hate thier parents for making them the way they are. or i hate thier friends for making them go along with everything or i hate thier granpa for hitting thier dad. its just soo messed up how much everyone we know effects us. both positively and negatively. but its still what happens. and i guess thats what makes the world soo cool. there are probably near 700 kids if not more in my junior class.  and i dont know how many i know by name.  thats weird. when i move into a city how am i going to know anyone?

      so if anyone expected me for brunch this morning sorry. i didnt have an alarm clock. and i was up until about 3 talking to kris. so i said forget it. i slept in my new room which was nice. the show went really well. and i was happy that kesterson didnt blow. so it was an overall good night. pp did some recording and baby b was hilarious to be around and greg was being funny.  i went to church and felt outside of it all. im not sure why. i have to help joey move into the city today. which means i cant take my pictures for photo class. but i will take them tomarrow. and then it will be fine. ill talk to you guys later.  love mike

      so billy boy came over after school and we got the two final songs that the prudes will play for the big show on saturday. im really excited. i think we can maybe blow some kids away. school today was nice i had a really good day but it was kind of long. but we had a cool columbus debate and some biology stuff and photo we sat and watched chemicals and stuff. and then 4th period we talked about our parents american dreams. theres a girl in my class who is a real downer on everything. she is always trying to see the bad in things i think. we were talking about the american dream and she went to the front of the class and lectured about what a "bubble" naperville is. thats really dumb stuff. coming from someone who has lived other places all over this great country. bubble or not. shut up. no one wants to hear what you have to say. if you dont like things change them. and i guess what makes america great is the ability to speak your mind. so i guess you can keep talking about all this stuff and how bad it is that kids live happy lives and drive nice cars. but i dont have to listen to it.  lunch was nice but when by too fast. i cant sit next to danny anymore. he is a nonstop flow of weird racism. and just that kind of ignorance that would make martin luther king jr. wince. hed make ghandi start punching him. and im just not strong enough to battle that.  so.  i will put up new prudes songs after the show maybe.  but here is a taste  all this feeling from a broken body never asking me to choose drown your sorrow in the biggest ocean ask your doctors "whats the use?"

      you keep rolling down the windows looking at the ground feeling too utterly hopeless to want to look around and you kiss yourself in the mirror because for once someone kisses back and you ask yourself why your life is intact   i dont know. cars.  who can really say.  refrain and it feels likes a hurricane passed through here today i could use a little novacaine.  to get on my way keep me from seeing the same old shit that were living in with our bodies like deserted cars and the roadmaps are our skin  verse 2  you never ask me for permission to steal all of my thoughts you just take them like their something you have bought and you keep stalling in the middle of feelings you dont have and i keep telling you that everything is making me too sad.

      so you wake up. tired. but not soo tired that you cant sit up straight the second time your mom calls you to wake up. you tried to fix the clock in your room. you walked into the cold garage to try to find the right tools for the job. you broght two philips head screwdrives and one flat head. and there you are. on your bed. trying to unscrew the casing on your alarm clock so you can get up and catch the bus. because tonight you dont want to drive tomorrow. you dont want to be alone in your car anymore. its just too much sometimes. So you get the sound to come through your alarm clock and its the buzzings of AM talk stations that you couldn't care less about. but its such an awful sound that its enough to keep you up. or get you up. or do whatever the purpose it was supposed to do is. and then you realize. whatever made your clock work well as a clock and alarm. is busted. inside of the casing that said do not open. electricution danger.  so you realize you dont know anythinga bout electronics. or even how a radio works. so you lay down to read white noise.    you is me.   your counting all the rips in my jeans as i just stare out into the dead street with a book full of things i could never say and a used up way of seein you next week  we amplify our anger with our eyes trying not to let the curtains close and you fold your hands around all that you love just a quarter and a heart that never shows  refrain  but that cant mean that you and me are not the same as them weve got our lives our matching smiles and the same way to pretend with silent steps in carpet halls we lose ourselves again waiting for a lonlier way to begin  verse 2  im trying not to look over your way it'd be too hard not to see who your looking at theres a garage full of things i cant complete and your asking for all of your cds back  and i never liked the music anyways. because all it did was made me think of death and i guess thats the point you were trying to make as we make believe that maybe somethings left  verse 3  so breath into the night to give it life and maybe someday it will come back to live but were both way to tired to believe and never in the mood to try and give  my heart to anyone who wants it bad it still knows how to beat and how to work and despite all of the knowledge taht i have its the shinning proof that im of little worth.  well i hope i gave enough for tonight. and its spanish study time.

      so heres whats really in my life at the moment.  ive got dibs. its never said but its always implied. if you like someone for longer they are your property right? i dont really know. thats my main problem  i think its kind of disrespectful to the girl almost if you want her all to yourself. i dont know though. theres also the romantic aspect and the selfish aspect. the world is a silly place. thats to say the least. so im in a sort of dilema  do i look past the mores about the whole situation and go against society or do i give into the whole  "bros before ho's" mentality.  but the girl isnt a ho.  and if you like someone chances are there is another guy who has liked her for longer then you that will be pissed if you pick her up. so what does that mean.  i dont know. today is one of those days

      so these strands of hair  fall in my eyes but i brush them away and we sit and read your poetry and we dont know what to say  so we try to sing  and anything will fill the void that you left today with a dollars worth of gas station candy welcome back to the united states.  refrain so long your going  are you, really going? these things are showing are they, really showing at all? and we get so lonely would you phone me, could you even phone me at all? and we love your poetry is it poetry, or is it words you set to fall?  verse on silent ears  we wait and breath so peacefully youve had some drinks and i think  your being too nice to me  its getting dark pretty soon and pretty soon we will not see that tiny star that we saw. that we named for you and me

      positively 4th street bob dylan  You got a lotta nerve To say you are my friend When I was down You just stood there grinning  You got a lotta nerve To say you got a helping hand to lend You just want to be on The side that's winning  You say I let you down You know it's not like that If you're so hurt Why then don't you show it  You say you lost your faith But that's not where it's at You had no faith to lose And you know it  I know the reason That you talk behind my back I used to be among the crowd You're in with  Do you take me for such a fool To think I'd make contact With the one who tries to hide What he don't know to begin with  You see me on the street You always act surprised You say, "How are you?" "Good luck" But you don't mean it  When you know as well as me You'd rather see me paralyzed Why don't you just come out once And scream it  No, I do not feel that good When I see the heartbreaks you embrace If I was a master thief Perhaps I'd rob them  And now I know you're dissatisfied With your position and your place Don't you understand It's not my problem  I wish that for just one time You could stand inside my shoes And just for that one moment I could be you  Yes, I wish that for just one time You could stand inside my shoes You'd know what a drag it is To see you

      i was sitting down trying to remember, as i sometimes find myself doing, exactly how we felt that night. i remeber we had gone to see kids our age play teachers in basketball and then like it was a normal thing. he suggested we go get sushi. i guess thats the way it went. i remeber unsteady steps we took up the bleacher to meet your family. i remember your mom slipping you some money and we walked out into the night. i remember jumping over a car and kicking in the hood and running. i remeber not feeling bad about it. i remember how my book kept you really entertained for the whole day. and how you printed it out and got surprised at how long it was. i remember the way you talked about your shoes and the way we talked about movies.  i remeber you.

      its been too long since i wrote one for you so ill swallow my sympathy and try to pull it through its not getting early but its hardly late and theres a chip on my shoulder that cant wait.  refrain so dont breath when im around ive spent 15 months trying to figure out why i cant help falling down so you better stay out of this town.  verse 2  and its been a year since the feelings were strong and like cigarette burns you always lingerd too long and now the scars start to show and i feel soo amused at the way we were  pointlessly used  verse 3 the rush of the tide somehow swept us away just like undertow we were gone the next day. and all that remaind was one orange warning sign and a couple of shells that i soon thought as mine.

      its getting too cold to even pretend that summers still here that will could stay friends i promised i wouldnt but its just what i did again  and i claw my eyes in search of the tears that spell "im sorry right" that can fill all the years but its soo complicated and you feel like shit and i dont want to be here.  refrain  ill press my finger to a window pane and hope that frost can spell my name as crystals form and shape what i become i press my back against and chainlink fence and anger is all that you have left and you keep saying that "im far too young"  refrain my cough it is back it rattles my chest your lungs turning black at least you have some left you saying dieing this way it gives you control id have to agree  we salute t shirts now with a half hearted grin and admire the ones that they hold within the meaning lost with light on a negative strip and its a picture of me

      i probably dont deserve either of you.  so here it is. when this all started i promised myself that i wouldnt lie to you. so instead ive been telling half truths for alot of the time. and those of you who know me best probably could have spotted them all along. so here is the truth. as far as i can see it.  I accidently led blair on. i considered us freinds because i didnt think she wanted more, and i guess for hte past few weeks ive been leading her on. and for this im truly sorry. I enjoy the time i spend with her soo much, but i dont realy think either of us was jumping up and down for something more to come from that. and if she was. im sorry. someone else is on my mind.  I think amanda is very pretty.  when im around her i smile more. the way she tells stories makes me laugh. i actually enjoyed talking to her on the phone(something that very few can do to me)

      greetings from my house. home sick. thats what i am. i had a monster sore throat that woke me up at 3 am. and i started to realize that prudes lyrics might come true. it was awful. so ive been sitting down in my basement putting songs onto i tunes for when i get my pod so that i can have it all ready to play whatever i want to hear. its going to be awesome. so far from yesterday and today i have a total of 613 songs on it. and it can hold 5000 so thats amazing. i cant even think of all the albums i want to put on there and just groove to. also belle and sebastian this thursday.  i dont like being home sick because there is a ton of work to get caught up on but im doing my spanish notebook and stuff so thats keeping me busy. i also want to finish a book im reading called herland thats a feminist utopian novel. My teacher was talking about the author of a book called the yellow wallpaper. and this is the same author. basically this book is trying to empower women by making men seem dumb and irresponsible. but its fun to read and it might just be true. so what can i really say about that.  well just thought id let you check in on me.  feel free to swing by and see how im doing. i dont think im contagious. i dont think thats how you spell it either.

      ode to the pretty girl working street construction  ive got a mirror on my window reflecting who i am back into the streets, where cold concrete becomes my only friend its reliable and sturdy solid to the core with the work of hands, that understand its too hard to be poor.  refrain and i watch you pour out roadways and i smile as you see that the sacrafices you make makes life easier for me. and the sun was hot on friday but you worked until it set and when the street finally went my way thats something i wont forget.  verse 2 its a lenghty explenation but its one that must be said your the backbone of the transit and your always a step ahead you make driving for me easy its soo smooth and just care free wheter its highway or city you always make it fun for me.

      in the minute it takes for me to get used to you being by my side i cant breath. i ask my self how i got here and why.  i wish i had a short fuse.   i wish i didnt produce frantic statements.  FOR BLAIR if you want to know the truth ill tell you. im just like everyother guy who has done you wrong. and its only different because this time your pretty sure of it. this time you arent ready to get hurt. and i applaud you for that i really do. but it makes my job a lot harder. how am i supposed to break your heart if you wont show it to me? and i feel bad. i really do. because i know that if it comes to that im just one more name on the list of guys who messed you up. we all know how it feels to be second pick. its a wonder soo many people have done that to you. and im really trying not to be the next one. but its hard to know you when we pretend to not see each other in the halls. and i should walk up to you. and demand your attention. show you that i am here and not going to leave you like all the others have. but instead i slip by. without a word. because i am the others. and maybe tomorrow i will have the courage to come and say something. to throw myself into your world. and hope to hell i land on my feet. but maybe not. because ive been saying that for a few weeks now. and it seems that the only thing keeping us apart is each other. -----------------------------------------------------  i wonder how i could explain it all to you in a soft way that doesnt make me seem like the monster i am.  but halloween is here. I want to be with you.   ------------------------------------  i want to close my eyes with you and never wake up alone again sitting in my car in the blue night time is slowly rolling in she told you all about me im sorry, its true im no good if it was hard to believe thats because i act differnt round you  refrain and on a sunday night  you were right for me when the moon just shone and the sky could sing me a song i wrote  and the evenins throats running dry as we stare off into the sky.  verse 2  i want your arm wrapped in mine just like it was at the dance but i want it all the time i wish i didnt have to ask i want to call you when im tired so you can wake me up i want to make my friends all liars i want to finally fall in love

      so i had a good time at homecoming. by far the best part was getting into a dance off with some real gangstas. luckily steve and i threw it down and won the competition  thats really all i can say. except i love thinking back about the good old days with girls. especially when they get to hear the old storys about how bad i treated other girls.  well its my history. i might as well accept that.  lets start a movement something soo soothing everyone joins do what you want to and if they dont want you youll flip over like coins  refrain and if i feel the bottom of the sea would you share all that with me or just leave. dont leave -----------------------------  its getting kind of late for talk like this wondering if what you needed was a kiss ---------------------  take my hand and place it on your heart we say beating's just a sign that its not hard to keep breathing even though sometimes your broke to keep needing futures that drift away like smoke  refrain and its not right to judge but we all hold a grudge

      you cant imagine what im thinking about right now  i had a dream and you werent in it but i spent all my time tryin to talk to you.  i keep leaving messages and you dont call me back.  its cool. we dont really need to talk anyways.  i rember the night brandon drove us home after a homecoming party and he and i walked to my house.  id like to settle down. start working someplace where people respect me for the crappy job i have and i can just work it until i come home. and then we can sit around and talk about our days and what we still want to do with our lives. and look up at the ceiling and wish until it makes us sick.

      a love song  when its raining outside i just close my eyes and the sun just shines through the clouds  with a smile on my face i can win any race i can come in first place i can be proud.  refrain and 1 thing i wanna do is 2 fall in love with you and together paint the sky blue with parachutes.  ------------------------------  you screamed   "when you wake up in a pool of blood im going to have the gun its pointed at your chest  the only vacant part i see  and when i stand there over you you can beg for mercy or just do whatever the hell you want it doesnt matter much to me"  refrain and you said kill me and i said gladly and i went to street and got a gun  and you said slowly i said you know me we wont finish quickly we have only just begun.  verse 2  when the rush you to the hospital all your friends will thnk your cool you took a bullet from a girl man arent you such a stud  and if a casket is what you perfer then im going to drive the herse ill drive it off a cliff  so ill be sure youve suffered enough.

      its now wednesday and i havent told you how i feel since monday. i hope no one got really lonesome.  so instead of telling you about the bonfire and the dance off i will put down a little song  there you were shinnin bright across the field across the night and hotel room and all these towels wont suffice  the stories told without end and we got old we got some friends to slow us down to keep us cool to not depend on  refrain and when i fall down i want you to kick the dirt into my eye  and i will try to not let it hurt.....so much  on sunday i woke up met a shower met gods love face to face with a preist and a crush  i said dad wont you help i feel bad im not myself he said my son youve just begun to lose your health

      you always said when i grew up i wouldnt need a tattoo or a pocket knife  or anything just be yourself thats what you told and i believed but nights get long and it gets hard just being me  refrain but you say cheer up dont let life get you down you may not have love but youve got me around its no consolation  prize i know but at least its something that doesnt let go.  refrain i told you once how happy  you made me and when your around i never want to leave and i never showed the heart  hidden up my sleeve because a compliment is the last thing you believe

      you said figure it out its written in code "dont i just love you" thats just how it goes a mirror cant tell what hurts you the most its just a mirage its only your ghost  refrain but when winter rolls around we wont let all our happiness drown lakes will freeze you and me will get cold  and when snow starts to fall we wont care much at all lets become angels  that game never gets old  verse 2 you said i couldnt see the writing on the wall "your too good for me" your too good for us all with a lit cigarette and a paperback grin you say you cant regret  where youve never been

      you said its true the world is flat and where you are is where its at a broken promise to cut your wrists this time  we talk around the issues there they breath in fumes i watch the air for your voice a trailing coil of rhyme  refrain and when reasons arent so clear well hold anything close dear so hold me tight weve got tonight to make it work  verse 2 you made a choice got in her face you raised your voice felt out of place its hard to tell why sometimes hell is green  across the sea took off your shoes sat on a train and sang the blues your heels to high tolerence to low it seems  verse 3 so you talk down to strangers backs youve got a book thats full of facts about your freinds that you can tell if they leave you  and they know just what, you think it doesnt show that you hate to drink its written on your face and in the bottle  thats before you.

      its going to be a hard life from here on out. at least thats what i think. but maybe things will get easier. and if they dont im fine with things the way they are. i guess i was getting criticized by kids for not being a good coach and trying hard to fit in. that sounds about right to me. i heard alot of funny stories today but you dont know my grandma probably so its not as funny. joey is coming into town but hes coming late late at night so i dont think ill see him. thats kind of weird. but itll be alright.  until then.  love mike

      so ive been living with a very hectic weekend and its only going to get a little more crazy.   its gettin so late i cant talk to anything. walk with me's what you said  but i was already down my street its been a tough week. and im feeling dead.  refrain so tell me something that wont bring me down "in the water we watch ourselves drown" but we have the ocean, and the sand in our shoes "between that and death its not hard to choose"  -------------------------------- your not talking to me now but i can hear your voice telling me all of my faults like i had a choice  fell asleep at your girlfriends house you smell like cheap wine and weve got you all figured out as your telling lies  ------------------  last i heard she was putting out cigarettes on her arm. this is the girl i loved. last i heard she was stoned. this is the girl i loved. And you told me as we sat and talked about sex that hindsight is 20/20 and i had to agree. but i cant let that affect me. I need a show to come and carry me away. i need to pick up the mic and play and let all the sickness and trouble out of my body with my words. and let the people there. who want to listen listen. and hope that they might enjoy what were doing. its an awful thing to love and lose. thats what we all say and hear and try to believe. and we say its better then to have never loved at all. but do you believe it. and do you believe my shaky nonsense sentences i cant even believe this.  the girl i loved and wrote at least 39 songs about spent yesterday putting out cigarettes on her arm.

      when kotek and steff were all like pedro the lion is good. i was like yeah sure whatever. and i got a refrain caught in my head. but that wasnt enough to have me pick it up. and now its been god. right before easter is when i had that song stuck in my head. its funny how you remember dates.  but now pedro fills my lungs. if i gasped for air. i would only get perfect lyrics and haunting music. god. its good.

      its the pack she has in her purse thats trying to kill her, she smokes them and watches as i drive infront of her it was my turn to go. my turn to turn.  she looks at me as though i have threatened her life as though my existance could kill her and she smokes as she stares me  down  and i wrote this today. in school a girl asked me what i was working on free verse poetry i told her metaphores and the realtionships to shoelaces and relationships. i dont think she wants to talk to me any more.  "THINKING THURSDAY" Your sometimes like a shoelace i watch you getting looser and looser but i dont tie you i let you drag behind me as i walk i let others step on you but i dont tie you  i feel you losing grip on me but i dont tie you and i start stepping on you and only when i start to trip  do i decide to tie you  back up

      A poem for you.  you hadnt met me when  i lost my front teeth and when i got busted  for stealing candy from the store  you hadnt met me when i couldnt pronounce the letter r and i loved to ride my bike and i wanted to smoke  you hadnt met me when i first felt alive and when i lied and got away with it and when i watched the sun set on the beach  you hadnt met me when the nights lasted forever and i decided to be a pilgrim instead of an indian even though all my friends were indians  you hadnt met me when i knew how to sing and my teacher couldnt get my name right and the waterfoutain on the girls side was colder  you hadnt met me when  i grew up and when i first learned to care and when i imitated every movie as well as a boy could  you hadnt met me  and thats why those memories mean less then every word ive said to you.

      i was in the shower  when i figured it all out the matters of fate and destiny. I was trying in vain to wash my hair my head cocked perpexly attemtping  to get fully submerged in the already  dirty water that was slowly leaving the tub. And suddenly it was clear  fate doesnt work  because of our pride. i could never sit back and say. i cant do any better then this. the concept of destiny is for cowards.  i try to catch my reflection in the murky pool of water but the strawberry soap runs into my eyes and im forced to close them to think about destiny as i splash  now lukewarm water in my face  and i thought about writing this, and then i did.

      so i walked into the room and you gave me a hug and it was hard to hate you when we were that close but perserverance and a winter cough are the two things i own to my name  and i saw her more in the halls did i tell you? ive been thinking about her more and it hasnt been the kind of thoughts that can distract,  merely the kind that make me smile  and when i told her about you she said she loved you already she always says that. my support, my own cheering section and i think to the night in the car how silent we all were. how razorblades and coverbands had cut our tounges right out of our mouths. and the only words that could escape our throats were im sorry

      ive reached a really scary conclusion. and its 1 in the morning and im totally thinking about this kind of thing because we cant just let life go on perfect when its this early or late or whatever. so im going to ramble and rant maybe. but i hope it will be short and not to confusing.   There are first times for everything. on this we can agree. and your like alright cool. first time. well this isnt the first time ive liked someone. and this isnt the first time someone has liked me. right? lets hope.  but when someone doesnt like you. andyour trying to get them to like you or whatever. its not like it can get any worse. at least when they dont like you you know thats about as bad as it can get. and i guess sometimes it gets so that you stop really talking to that person. and then thats worse but. when that person likes you back.  at any moment.   they could just stop. and youwould be standing there. shocked. with nothing.  god its scary. i mean i saw the ring and gothika and crap texas chainsaw massacre. but nothing like that scares me as much as the thought  that somone could just stop caring about you.  and how messed up. that i have done that to people. but it was people who didnt like me. so its not as bad. but still.  if im supposed to learn a lesson here. i fucking learned it tonight.  i get it. dont mess with people dont mess with emotions dont tell girls they are fat. dont do alot of the things you think are funny or whatever  and dont take anything for granted ever.  its funny.  what if in nightmares we start getting dumped?   id never fucking sleep again.  alright goodnight love mike

      so i had a good time with blair tonight at the john mayer concert. i wouldnt say i hate his music, but i wouldnt say that i adore it the way she did. or does, or used to or whatever.i twas a a good time   its a tapestry of feelings that combine to make something seem more then a just a moment in time  ive got all these dreams that keep me up at night and its my memory that dies. it dies  refrain  theres something lurking beneath my skin i let it out to let you in but you dont shout and you dont see how what you dream is what i blelieve theres something lurking you talk of him i locked you out you knocked back in i couldnt shout and i cant see your all i need   verse 2  a masterpiece of childhood scars that sometimes bleed just like your heart  but they dont beat they just tear apart when company comes as they are.

      so its a morning and im soo tired that i think life has passed me by  and with out warning you retired to let your life pass you by  ------------------------------  im through with this game you play and you dont even relate its true you just something stale  ------------------------  you catch yourself in shattered glass with camera in your hand  and the pictures that  you always took never mattered in the end  its a rollercoaster to the coast where you think life can begin  but i lived there for a few months and it didnt matter then  refrain so now when you shout i hope your vocal chords explode tell the world what is wrong as if everyone should know its not hard to be last and you sure let it show broken hearts dirty sleeves as if we all didnt know  verse 2  you wake up to  a car alarm attached to the radio  plugged in the wall with everythings going where wires go  hes off at work till 4 o clock and then hes coming home  well if i ever get a job ill probably elope   -----------------------  you covered your hands with the blood of your family the line running through the years  injuries left  for the birds and the famine get washed and bleached with tears  its a 1 gun salute straight into your temple that shows you how to behave  to good for a note. you really should leave one "its only a game we play"  refrain stop looking in the mirror its messing with your head stop looking in the mirror dont say were all just dead stop loookin in the mirror go watch the snow instead cause nothing gets much clearer in the end.  verse its torture, this world when you cant awaken and sleep crawls into your eyes  and you want to just float on top of the water and change it all to wine  you dig into skin and carve your initials and think it will really stay this time  because youve gone deeper then you ever meant to but your scared cause you feel fine

      alright. this song just rules. like hard core.  PEDRO THE LION PROMISE  I'll take something to believe, something with long sleeves, 'cause it's unpredictable that Jesus said he'd fill my needs but my heart still bleeds, He's just not physical. Why can't I see?  If I look up and the sky's not there is there any reason that I should be scared? When a promise is a promise, I'd know.  Now we've established lack of sight, maybe vision's the right word for what I need 'cause I can't see with human eyes. Lord knows I've tried to follow where He leads me. Why can't I see?  If I look up and the sky's not there is there any reason that I should be scared? When a promise is a promise, I'd know.  From what I've seen so far I can't believe my eyes, and what a nice surprise.  If I look up and the sky's not there is there any reason that I should be scared? When a promise is a promise, I'd know. If I look up and the sky's not there is there any reason that I should be scared? When a promise is a promise, I'd know.

      on my back in a hallway at school it all started to be clear how the world maybe isnt soo bad and im lucky to be here  =============  maybe im crazy but your looking dead and im not really sure if you meant what i said cause im feeling soo selfish that singing to you is for me  ============  when it hits you that you never even cared will you start to smile before you are aware that someones watching you from far far away  =================  i run my fingers down the walls and feel the pipes as they explode around this shatterd house with nothing left except your ghost and it just cant get out the worlds to big to see at once and it might take you days and it might feel like nothings done  =============  when you wake up and its 3 am suddenly everything just stops you dont care about all of your friends or those kids who threw beer at cops its just coughing and trying to breath when the air in your lungs feels hot so just get up and try to leave  but your legs and your joints are shot.  ==========================  more or less your the best thing thats happend too me and if you didnt guess ive got feelings  for you  ill try my best to not let it be a big deal but you know how i am and you know just how i feel  refrain  soo if you feel afraid.  take my hand and a razor blade we can fend of demons with the small cuts that we made and if your feeling tired we can lay by the fire and watch as smoke is born and everyone will know that your for me.  ------------------------------  its never been what you said theres always a catch we are missing his heart never left his head in the back of a bus we werent kissing not that the driver knew any way kids will do what they want when the feel it you keep searching for something to say oh your such a tease i just need it understand its not me right away iwil be soo amused over you over you pretty soon it all collapses remodeling if your a cynic emotions are high and your asking to tell you all about the women to tell you all about the women you dont know. how hard it is to force a smile always

      i just went out and saw love actually with my sister and it was a good time. i know some of you are going to say that i dont have a sister. but whatever. kris is about as close as i have to one. it was a good time and a great movie. and just like always another one of these movies i just want to rush out and sweep someone off their feet.   change that. i want to rush out and sweep you off your feet. yeah. you, yes you.   so blair bo baggins and i went shopping around and it was a ton of fun. id tell you what i bought for people if i thought that maybe they would never stumble across this blog in a million years. but this is the internet and i dont want anyone knowing what they have for xmas. it was quite an adventure and this really old guy totally played a trick on me in home depot  now im not a grown up, but im not alittle kid either. and this guy did the stain on your shirt trick and i totally feel for it. but i totally never thought that someone would try to play a weird trick on me like that. i dont know i guess i just feel weird about all of it   well. all i can say is.  i want to fall in love with you.

      so im sorry that i havent really been talking to you as much this week. ive been really busy with school stuff and library stuff and just trying to read as much as possible with the time i have on this earth. i was talking to mikey u and i told him i hated how with each book you read it changes the way you feel about everything if its good. but i guess thats probably my favorite part about books. if you look above you will see the title of my blog is the title of the book i am currently reading. its really good im like 230 pages into it and really enjoying what its telling me.  i was sitting by the computer and up pops an instant message from none other then james swanberg. and he told me i had to read this book. so i went out and rented it that night. i just trust him that much. lord knows he hates reading books soo when he suggested this i knew it was worthwhile. plus i know that after i finish i can see the movie staring hugh grant. so its win win. i also have to go see love actually really soon. i have a man crush on hugh grant. and im proud of it. hes whitty and charming and everything good. and screw you if you dont agree.  im about to go with blair bo baggins to the mall so i can get some christmas gifts for my family before the rush.   what that really means is im going to spend all my money if i dont buy people presents. and i dont want to do that really. so now everyone gets to win instead of just me. but i guess we all win at christmas time.   enjoy your day.   kris's birthday party here and red lobster today. boo yah. i totally bought her the present she asked for. im such a good brother. i figure thats about what i am anyways.  cool runnings.

      so why this chasing? why all the time am i shooting for somethign i cant have? why when i get to the point where im on to somethign great and a person i truly adore is very close. do i do things to mess it up. i was thinking today as i turned off the alkaline trio. i was driving home from blairs house. wondering how i could think she was soo great and then go off chasing another girl. why would i do that to someone. why would i go after something i cant have when something that feels right is in front of me? and then suddenly i realized it.  i dont think im mature enough for a relationship with anyone.  and i would have loved to think that that isnt it. because im such a cool guy and i write songs and stuff. that i must be the perfect guy for dating a girl. but im not. i just dont know why. why? what is it that i cant do?  i guess i kind of always should have known this. im just not the right guy for hte job. i cant play the happy guy well.   but i want to. i really do.   so if you have any insight into this. or something along those lines please send it to mikey@benlee.zzn.com because i would love to hear froma ll of you. also i realized it was cool the way joey answered questions on his bio. so if you want to send me questions you want answered about me or the world at large. just send them my way.  and im really still sorry. you shouldnt have to be as strong as weve all made you.

      so you take two kids who both realize they are hopeless romantics and you try to get them to solve each others love problems and you really end up with a movie staring hugh grant and someone else. it doesnt matter who. maybe george clooney. yeah.  i am following the river down the highway through the cradel of the civil war.  graceland paul simon

      i like teh blog alot.  i just want you all to know that it means alot for you to read my life and i guess. either feel sorry for me, or be ashamed at what i say. and i just hope that some of the things that happen on this can offer you insight or at least make you smile.  so what im really getting at.  is if you ever go back and check the archives. you can really see where i am right now.  its interesting.  butterfly theory.,     i can see you in your car thinking about hating me its been such a long time since we talked like this  and its a needle in the hay but you gotta take a chance sometimes you know your on my mind but ive got other thigs to do today  refrain  so hide your feelings  cuase no one wants to see them and stop complaining cause you dotn have a girlfriend if your soo lonely you might have a problem i know you got me but i cant really solve them anyway  verse 2  theres a lot of things i hate but that never seemed to bother you when we talked about our days we always used to smile  you said questions were the way to start all conversations off and i know now you were right but i wish taht you were wrong sometimes    ------------------------------------------   fight me if you want u dont know what you need cant you ever dream kids dont know whats wrong  your such a pretty girl or your eyes they really shine u dont even know whats on my mind  ----------------------------  we were sitting there watching the park change knowing that the world wont always be the same i should have kissed that night. or maybe later that week but i dont know whats going on with me  refrain  and if you want someone special ill introduce you to some friends who know how to treat the laides because i am not like them  im not really a romantic i just sometimes wish i was and the only answer i can give is because  verse 2 i know "sorrys" not an answer but it really feels okay when i cough myself awake at night i wish that you would stay telling stories on the telephone we wonder what to say but i know someones hoping i wont break the waves.

      its funny how you get good and bad news all in a day. and the good makes your day seem pretty alright. then the bad comes along. and i dont feel too bad. dont get me wrong. i got a fortune cookie today that said its always darkest before dawn. so i guess i better start looking up. and maybe things will get dope.  do you ever wish that your whole world was just flipped upside down. but not for the worse. i guess for the better. i dont know what i want on nights like this. i go out to the movies and i laugh and i smile and i joke around but then i remember the way somethings are and i wonder why that smiling isnt enough.  what a dumb thing for me to type. things are actually going really well. and i dont feel sad or bad or anything really. like i said. i got a really positive fortune cookie.  and i think thats enough for me today.

      so its been a few days since ive told you anything. and i guess i feel bad about that. im on a laptop and i guess i just dont want people, aka my parents reading this blog too often. its not like im a bad kid i just dont really want them to have to hear about my little kid troubles. and if thats wrong then maybe they should read it. i just dont want to bore them with my problems. my mom showed alot of strenght and compassion tonight, and i know im not the only one who is thankful,  i wanna be the one who forgets its your birthday so i can stand with empty hands and nothing to say its no excuse for calling you up soo late but i am sorry. it couldnt wait  you watch things as they move around, i watch you as you check out the surroundings and the room and my hands move neverknowing what to do if i was braver would i say things that just werent true  refrain and love is not the answer its a means to an end i wanted to dance with you but i guess ill be your friend you can call me up and tell about all the boys you know and your out of town ill be out at my show  verse 2 your soo beautiful at nightime and they day is just the same its a wonder that this summer i didnt even know you name  but theres some things that i remeber. and of them is your face i cant imagine not seeing it everyday  and theres some parts of me im losing one of them is time i cant give you my two cents, cause all i have is dimes and quarters of the season get caught up in our rhymes but ive never been soo caught in someones eyes.

      so last night was pretty cool. i had  a good time just kind of keeping to myself and dan. its always nice to see dan around. i should probably call him more. steff tried to kill my mutant balloon so i gave it to amanda for safe keepings. she was upset about not getting to go to a haunted house. i told her i would go with her but i dont think she wanted that. haha.   after her reaction to the texas chainsaw embaressment id be surprised if she made it out of a "haunted" prision alive.  i wish i could be wearing a no fear t shirt and suddenly feel no fear.

      so ive been battling an ear ache and alot of feelings i keep having. and i know that alot is actually a lot so dont bother pointing that out to me. im not that great of a speller and for those of you who read this even semi frequently you totally know that already.  so yesterday was cool. and i had a good time and thats all.  today i woke up at 930. my clock is now set to some country station in the mornings. let me think of what it says. there was some song. and he said something that struck me as utterly silly. i dont really remeber what it was. but im sure if you heard it you would laugh out loud. i dont know. i had to go to a church thing. i now have an official title. i am a minister of hospitality. i decided with stu baby that we would help out hte church during masses and stuff. so now thats what im going to do. it should be pretty exciting. at least then i will have something to do during mass. i saw something ive written on someone elses info and it made me smile huge.  don and i went shopping. i bought an mc honkey cd. that is total good and typewriter sent me like 4 million cds all packed into two. he encoded them as data files or something so that he couldfit 17 cds on 2 or something. its crazy. but there are some awesome bands on there. so i will update you all on that as more happens. i want to see raising victor vargas really soon. also. the piano teacher, a movie by the dude who did funny games, is at blockbuster.

      here we go again  i closed my eyes and put my face up against yours, trying not to breath onto you for fear you might just blow away. and i feel like an idiot for saying i love you right now. in my shaky voice. without looking at you in the eyes. but youkissed me anways. i take a step back from you say it again. without doubt without fear. only a heart and two hands that touch your skin and get warm in your pockets. i love the way you always brush the hair out of your face. i love the way you get embaressed about things you say when i dont think they are that dumb. i love the way you talk to me. i love the way you hold your phone away from you when someone is talking to loud i love your eyes, and your neck and your hands and your hair and your smile and your spirit and your detirmination and your frown. and i loved how you said to me "it doenst feel right to not be touching you."

      for a new night    Lace me up like tennis shoes Take me out tonight Ill kiss your feet again Tear me up like autum leaves In winters teeth Like all our closest friends  We are effortlessly soo detached Its hard to ask Someone to understand The way we write our hearts on napkins Our dreams on our skin With one thin line to stand  For all that we believe in The pain is leaving Cheshire cats to scratch our arms Please love just give me something better Then a brand new sweater To hide what ive become  Your beauty plays on movie screens The silent pictures We scream ourselves to sleep With the humming of our empty hearts And our begging souls That pray the lord might keep  Himself hidden from us im soo embarrassed Of how i looked tonight Standing in the light of my street With you next to me Just trying not to try  To live life like a stranger As I get closer Then ive ever been I can feel you in my music Your singing to me I can taste you on my lips

      fill up with fear and the question persists that you just might be living a lie   so i accompanied blair to young life and it sure was an experience i guess i just didnt know what it was going to be like. only she and i shall ever know what i truly think.  "do you ever get the feeling that this is just the start"  i feel sorry for anyone who reads this and hates me talking about her. but its hard to be upset at the world with her around.   you are the math homework that i got points for even though i didnt really have it done.

      who is stuck in the same shit position we all get put in sometimes.  so the winter has slowly settled into all of our bones and that could only mean one thing. christmas. or for some people (bliar) chaunaka. i think i spelled that right. believe you me. she will get 8 of the rockenest presents this side of jeruselum. umm but thats not where i want to start. or finish. because theres alot of stuff that happens along the way to get to where i am. and thats what i think one of our faithful readers has to read.  sometimes i get out of touch with all of you. so if there is anything you want to see just hook me up with a letter. and i know i awlays ask for letters. and i never get any from anyone. how lonely is it checking your mail and only seeing the epitath weekly news letter. and your pissed because they dont talk about the weakerthans anymore anyways. but.  all i want for christmas is you. its just been coming true for everyone.  but here is what i think. for you. my brothers.  do it. and i knwo this wont apply to everyone. and if you know who im mostly talking about that doesnt mean you shouldnt take any sort of silly advice that im about to dish out. and i know we will all say "he only sees relationships as postivie because hes in one"and you know what. thats true. because when i wasnt a part of anything it was easy to be like. its hard. but now that im in one. its easy, and all it takes is a few easy steps.  step one. shut the fuck up about your life step two. step up to the plate and swing your bat as hard as you can. i dont like baseball analogies. ummmmm step up to the plate and just charge the mound. still baseball. umm just tell the person how you feel about them acceptions to step 2 (some people are already in relationships it seems that the best thing for you to do is sit and wait for them to get out of thier relationships, right. WRONG. do not even wait. get get get get get over them. even if they leave thieir boyfriend/girlfriend for you are still a total jerk ass. thats for sure. and i love you i truly do. but dont be a jerk. step 3 get rejected. this might not apply to all of you. lets hope none. step 3 part b if step 3 happens write a bunch of sad songs. then listen to plea from a cat named virtue. then go "wait how the hell am i supposed to feel" step 4 enjoy the benefits of being able to be so close to someone you cant even focus. or the ability to talk and have you lips touch theirs and have that be way better then kissing. even though kissing is pretty darn good.  ive kissed 3 girls in my life. is that so  wrong?  step 5 break up/ get married both seem pretty hard to do.  i wish you allthe best of luck in your romantic endeavors.  may christmas find you a happier person.

      i hope   you folded me like a paper and you tucked me in your book i stayed with you as you moved around the town  i hardly knew what it meant to be a picture without frame till my corners bent and i   couldnt name a thing  refrain  so walk with me down past the dreams that lay themselves on liams street off into the park thats where we'll be to  sit and talk and swing on swings  verse 2 i carried you like a wallet or a phone always checking if your still there over my shoulder angels and devils both say "go home" but i know that for sure my heart is here i woke up on my daily bed and carried a tune to the shower with me to fall apart down in the drain and wash away back to the sea

      so this is how i find out  what ive been missing all these years and when things start to work out i wonder why i got scared  -----------------  its such a an awesome time to be around you the look in your eyes when i do all the little things taht i do and you know that im doing them  for you  its a tiny romance thats told in time with how i feel in each consecutive rhyme and you know that when your on my mind i feel fine  its a fairytale without all the stuff that gets in the way of falling in love  that magic potions and toads are enough to stop   its more then i ever could want just sitting there in your car i know exactly where you are in my arms     nothings going to change the way i breath except  for when you talk to me or when you start to leave for new scenery     i swear i just turned the calinder a whole new year is almost here  its hard enough not to notice the little stuff like your hair or the way you change the air  and i know its bad enough when i get caught up on that stuff like your eyes and the way they watch the lives

      well theres soo much to say. i will start with yesterday afternoon.  im sitting down at my locker and pete comes up and askes me how im getting home. isay bus. he says my bus. we say bus. and we drove all the way to plainfield to skate againts the lights on 59.it took forever.  but i get home. and then i get ready to go see this drag show.  now dont get me wrong. i like homosexuals as next as the next person. oh wait. alot more then most people do. but thats a nother story for another post. so we walk into a church basement and suddenly we feel way out of place. and i dont pass judgement on people. what htey want to do with thier bodies and lives is their own deal but the whole time i felt like they were passing judgement on me. and that made me upset. but they did put on one hell of a show, that i loved ot watch even though from time to time it was crazy and one man, in drag ofcourse, rubbed right up on dan durning a song and dance number. and it was maybe the best thing i have seen in a long time. you want to make dan feel uncomfortable>? bring him to a drag show.  so dan and chris left at different times, when they had to, not becasue they felt bad. and then it was blair and i. and a world of people. it was sure an experience. as we walked to the car we were both kind of smiling just because of what had happened.  we spent maybe an hour sitting in my driveway  talking and listeing to the new shins cd. best hour of my young life id say.  steff left. but when she gets back. i will get to see the biggest smile in the world on her face.  i want to write more stuff later tonight. so hopefully words will lend themselves to me.

      my good luck began with a huge sweep of the worst grades i have ever gotten back in just about every one of my classes but thats not bothering me today.  THrough the dreary wilderness of the revolution the brave young men proudly marched along with the wispers in thier heads that sting like alchol the sat and hummed the same old silly song.    -----------------------  half of all that you know died in a boat crawling towards shore  -----------------------  you feel asleep with the lights all burning and there was me looking at the moon a quiet night nothing seems to wear a raincoat as i sit and stare and dream of you  refrain  when i get older im going to see that all that i wanted was nothing i need and your so finely crafted that i cant believe what a pleasure it is when your next to me  verse 2  you rung your hands like a bell a top a tower looking over the world that lay below a scummy river and some kids with zippo lighters a early morning and now we really know    verse 1 you walked up to me with sparkling eyes and and i cant breath when i tell lies it stays in me till it settles down below my lungs to help me drown. it out  and nothings going to change if we dont close our eyes were all just going to live until the day we die  ------------------------  wore my soul on my sleeve ive got nothing going on and between you and me its a fire that fills my heart  wrote a poem for you read it over the phone guess its kind of a joke  that we laugh at when were alone.  refrain but maybe you can walk into my head and hang around or stay the week instead and you left town, well i left me for dead   ------------------------------  sometimes my veins, they pump gasoline it poisions my heart, your looking at me i try not to choke, on every sound that brings me to you and leaves me around  refrain so show yourself no more hiding and i will live, all that i sing and i wont ask for you nicely ive spent too long, on that shit  verse 2  when things get dark, i start to believe that i am a part, of everything  and you just dont see, the look in my eyes thats flying around you, thats makeing me try.  verse 3  if i start to drown, on numbers and signs i wont leave the town., or stop wasting time its only a class, they all say to me theres worse things then math, or geometry   -------------------- WE CAN CALL THIS THE RHYMING CONFESSIONS OF A GIDDY SCHOOLGIRL ROMANCE AS TOLD BY MIKESWANBERG IN 2003 woke up got tired layed around in my bed you called i stood up got dressed  sat down on the steps put on what was left some socks my shoes its you  that keeps me feeling so good you  keep  me in the right mood you  keep  me talking out loud you keep me around.  on a plane i knew nothing about you at least 3 months away  we sat and talked but it wasnt my fault that you had felt  that way   its late i know i probably should sleep but your  the best part of me  so i sit and talk till my voice is like chalk just scratched all over the street   0-------------------  A SONG FOR STEFF TO THINK ABOUT ON HER TRIP  HAPPY BIRTHDAY SOON i started to write you a letter but conventions just stood in my way i thought that a song might do better but i just threw it away  refrain  nothing i do feels good enough for you but i love you just the same if i had to choose i would never loose you and i know i might some day  verse 2 i tried to sing, what you meant to me but my voice just stopped in my mouth i had a dream, and it started to seem that you belonged in my house  ----------------------  its interesting when i woke up this mornight i wondered when i would write anything again  -----------------

      so i havent told you anything for days and i know that it doesnt matter much anymore.  what does it mean to love someone?  i spend my life telling the people that i love that i love them. i watch my friends walk around and live thier lives and when something goes wrong my love is enough for them. and i know that they will be there and they will love me back and our love will be enough to get the other person through whatever is going on.  then why is it different when your dating someone? i could meet any old girl on the street and love her in a matter of a few hours. to the point where i would do anything for her. but here i am with so many similes ive been trying to use instead of just saying love. but "i like you a lot" does not do justice to how i really feel.   so i said it.  to her  and i meant it.  some things start soo small and get so big, call it chaos theory call it ripple effects call it anything you would like. it starts with your smile and moves to my smile then into my brain then down through my spine then into my vocal chords which trigger my lips to tell you exactly how you feel.  nothing has felt more right in my life.  i know the thin ice im standing on. and id give up anything to stand here longer.

      i walked the cold streets and hoped your car would pull up next to me and you would lean over the passenger seat and open the door  no words would be said, i would climb into your car into your life and we would drive away.  so i watch every car for you and i see you in the face of every girl that will never be half as gorgeous as you were without make up  and when i read your words i hear your voice speaking them into my ears you told me our lips were a perfect fit   but no words need to be said, i will climb into your car into your life and we will drive away.

      so iwent back to the original blog thing i had. i hope you dont mind i really liked it back in those days so maybe im just being a little bit nostalgic.  I was excited to have some new classes and some new faces around.   first period gym will be neat second period bio will be strange to say the least. my teacher seems really nice and he looks kind of like a hippie so he told us that he was in california studying mushrooms and my whole class tried to hold back our laughter. third period i have math class fourth lunch fifth spanish 4 i maybe knew half of what my teacher said to us today so thats either a good thing or a bad thing. lo que sea. i then have jewelry and i guess they signed up too many kids so some had to choose to drop the class. which sucks but they can take it later if they want. the period after us i guess there are going to be 45 kids. the probably made 20 kids drop from that period. i dont know how they cant just fill the right amount of spots then call it a day. maybe that would be too easy.  im really happy

      they start to make sense the longer im at it.   i woke up just a few hours ago and i didnt get enough sleep because it felt more important to type messages to people all night.  Im ready for a new classes. dont get me wrong if you read this and are in any of my classes i enjoyed the time we spent together but i feel i have exhausted alot of the conversation amongst a lot of kids in my classes so i need new things.

      scientist will prove that we never even existed.  its 730 at night on friday.   i pulled of the c in spanish so that means the world is mine. i have control over my activities now and i can do what i want and dream what i want and do homework when i want to.   there are alot of things from my childhood that i never realized how beautiful they are. but last night i layed and looked up at plastic glow in the dark stars and realized how pretty they were. i wish i could have some but i have one of those ceilings that looks like cat puke or something and it drops white things on you if you touch it.   i cant grasp any larger message.  i did it guys. mission impossible.  i guess alot of impossible missions were acomplished.

      i'll sleep for days    i learned a lot of spanish today,  but in the long run  ehhh   i thought that you couldnt possibly look more beautiful then you did   as your face was painted blue by the television as it told stories we didnt listen to  and i held you soo close that  you were a part of me "the only thing ive done right"  and we wispered words that meant more then "i love yous"  we told the truth  if i could spen my whole life standing in your hallway i would feel complete   "your fucking beautiful"

      at your boys   i caught myself watching your lips as they said everything i hoped they would say  and i breathed you in until my lungs filled with how your hair looks and how you hold me and how you breath when your tired  i put my head on your pillow and stared at  postersthat became stars and your sheets became grass   it starts with my brain and works its way through my spine and then  fingers the ones that touched your skin they type out words that i want to need to  say to you. and the keys depress and enter code which appears on screen  and wires carry it to you

      a dream   i just wish i could be a poet already, why arent there people all over the country looking for new poets. i sat in borders and i read. the words of people who write what they feel. but i know that there might be people who would like to read what i feel.  i just think that some people want a poet who speaks to them about their lives.  the road less traveled. im not there  what a raven said to man i dont really see significance  so   maybe im a kid with no understanding of poetry. in fact that is what i am. but.  why cant i be what appeals to a world of mes?

      i'll be your pride.  i was wondering  what if im in the other car the one that you smash in your dream i know that you die. but what happens to me? --------------------  some days i wish you would ask me to die for you or question my devotion so i could struggle for metaphors to try to prove that i deserved being with you.  --------------------  i could have stood with you  in that alley and watched the blank sky,  all night the tops of house shine  with the chilly rain that collects on your clothes and mine.  over a river i spilled my guts out  and you forgot to blink i fought  back crying i swear im not like that not that wasnt really me.  balanced on a railing such a long fall and either direction might ruin me step back on solid hard to aknowledge that i havent  changed anything  we sat in my driveway and you still kissed me so i knew that i was saved ------------------------  in photographs,  we never ask if they felt sad that day but still smiled get payed to fake it make your mind vacant so nobody knows  that youve had your trials. so nobody knows your sick of your style so nobody knows you dont like to smile  wake me up with your phone call or i might never get up at all wake me up with your phone call or i might just  sleep through it all  -------------------------  i could have been that salt that filled your wounds such a honest profession, to just profess my love for you. i could have been the one who got to choose. what he felt when he felt it but now i only loose  sleep over you just go i dont care if you know im a mess i was losing sleep over you now you just go  on by.  i wish it made me want to die  ----------------  you told me what you really want is for someone to say it so you believe and you know what? what i really want is for you to say it to me --------------------      you know im not the best your going to find and i know im not the last one of my kind but i know ive got just enough for the both of us  ---------------  all that i want, is to be with someone like you for the rest of my life   ------------------- i cut you from my life like soo many strands of hair that i wathced as they lay there  on the floor i let them blow away with the wind into the garden because i didnt give a shit anymore  dont tell me that your sad cause i probably wont notice if your smile or your frown is a little off i usualy watch the floor almost everytime i see you and i guess thats just  what it costs  remember in the summer when i said i thought i loved you well i knew back then  i was wrong i got carried away had too much fun digging my grave with every wasted night and song  the night that we broke up i paid for you at the movies and pretended i  didnt mind and now i looking back i thought we would get back together i probably shouldnt have been that kind  and even if you died  for no reason tomorrow at your grave i might force myself to sing all those sad songs i used you as a catylst for because i didnt have  anyone else  desperate and alone is the only way i want to see you with tears streaming down  a beautiful face i spent so much time  trying to stay on your mind you werent half as exciting as the chase

      poetry and prose and martha all i had was you and all you had was me.   if you dont like when i get poetic on this thing. which some of you dont. i suggest this full we you should refrain from bloggin it. because i need to submit to the lit mag within this next week. i have a dead line now. so im going off.   i wondered what it might take for you to do it? walk the heels of your shoes i mean. or gain the courage to kick off your shoes on a train heading to knotting hill, the only town name i recognize in all of london. "what stop are we getting off on?" somehow every street corner can look the same when its late here and early there. nothing really fits in the time between now and then. call it a pond, call it an ocean, it still means there is at least 8 hours between the two of us. and thats on a plane. sometimes i wish i was on the titanic. i want my story told while girls cry their eyes out and profess thier love to ME. is there any other reason to live?   we pace up and down isles of cds from bands ive never heard i keep picking up obscure things  and making jokes about how   this is what i came for.  you kiss me and i wonder if anyone saw. not to be embaressed or proud just to wonder. and we flip through music and talk about things  that we liked to hear when we were kids. we slowly fade out into the parking lot and i kissed you by the car and realized  this is what i came for.

      because   when you start a post you totally have all these great thoughts you want to lay out there. but then you forget and get on a tangent then just end your post. so here is what i meant.   there is soo much stuff on my walls now. more then there has ever been. some say its slowly becoming your room but theres a lot of dedication there that i dont have. but what keeps me wondering is what happens when this ends? will i leave up everything that reminds me of you? or will i tear downt he cards and pictures, any relics of what we had. toss a fire to history? i dont think i could do that.   i wont ask, if you wont tell.  just come around  my angel flies carries all my fears angel dont die for four more years

      and maybe its time to live.   so its been kind of a long night and blogger was down. but its 11:27 here and im about to go watch wet hot american summer and ive just been sitting and thinking about relationships and love and stuff. you know typical things. and vasich and i were talking. about girls  on the long ride home  we are both soo sick of girls saying they cant find good guys, i mean come on. what you mean is you cant find a super hot guy who doesnt want to just jump your bones. and come on. thats just silly. and if you want a hot guy you have to put up with whatever you get. and i mean im sure there are a million nice hot guys. but just stop being soo picky if your lonely.  we are all very lucky boys. i wonder if the girls think they are lucky?

      yes kind of.   it was insane that today more then one person came and talked to me about the blog who i had no idea read it. i guess thats what its there for but i almost feel bad that people have to sit through my tyrades and attempts at correct spelling. tyraid? tieraid? tiiraid? i dont know  but i went to see the vipers play tonight with chris and he gave me a kick butt b day present.  spike jones music videos and wet hot american summer.   i havent seen either but im happy. i guess the b day is tomorrow and i was surprised and i guess just surprised when blairs mom said happy birthday tomorrow to me. i dont know its just funny.  oh vaynerman, if you are reading this sorry for that. i just forgot is all. and im a silly silly boy.  some things arent tangible i know because ive felt them resting inside of the souls of my shoes that feel soo heavy as i walk throw the snowfall and i feel myself falling all around you.  im spending valentines this year in the city recording songs that you should hear someday soon you said "you always spent it alone" before you met me but i will spent the 13th just with you  its careless caution that keeps making me abandon photographs that dont deserve a full page the contrast stinks you cut off arms and where his hands are makes girls nervous makes boys criticize me.  so take your tylenol dont overdose on living weve stil got some songs to play inside the box we speard out animals sometimes i feel like noah putting two and two  together is such a loss.

      i know i know i know. you hate to read what i write.   Took those nights in the summer, trapped them in my memory Then girls walk up with black lipstick, and ask do you remember me Its hard enough to carry on, when you dont care about your pain. But its just tough, when all you want. Is someone to forget you name  Refrain So take those songs I wrote, And burn the edges Leave what’s dead alone, until it stays dead Make the most of ghosts inside your bed sheets Until its hard to see a life less haunting  I met myself inside your window, and didn’t like what Id become And when your selfish you really know, how easy it is to belong And all you ask for in those letters, that you write but never send Is for someone to take your dreams from you, and teach you to defend  I traded it all for a feeling, that I cant even name And you said love is, soo appealing, but your just pictures in a frame That holds you down but hardly touches, the way you looked to me that night And I say no, that’s not what love is, its something we all fight  ---------------------------------------  In trying to hold onto it we all let it slip through our fingers. You rushed over to see if I still had any of it left in my hands. But I could have told you over the phone that I hadn’t seen it or heard from it in years. I traded it in for the music you hear on the stereo and the comments that I make when boys with dyed hair fuck girls with eating disorders. But its all such a joke anyways. You might as well laugh along with me instead of attempting to recover what we all buried with our television smiles and cynical thought processes. Its not any problem that we should be worried about, every day more people get it and lose it we aren’t the ones who should be worried, it will carry on as long as we do. Im sick of all the nostalgia. I don’t miss those days half as much as I miss the people that filled them.  -------------------------------------------  I looked out over a million stars that lay on the ground fighting to become a part of the night and I thought about you. And wished that I could set all of them free for an instant so you could look at the sky and see as many stars as you did in Alaska. but suddenly being thousands of feet in the sky was to far from you, too far from everything. “what city do you think that is?” its hard to tell at this time. When rivers don’t shimmer and snow blankets towns I will never set foot in. I contemplated throwing open the door and letting myself get sucked out of the plane. To fall into these stars. To watch my life turn into something worth watching on tv. But when we landed all I had was some gifts for you, and no songs to sing.  ----------------------------------------------- We sat and talked about disaster Till it filled our very souls And one by one we all asked her To poke our lives full of holes Head strong boys with shaking fingers Ready for this very ride And maybe its not you that lingers On the tips of all my nights  Refrain So we collide at somebodys house  and smile But we both want out and denial is to predictable and I forgot I called beautiful  we escape home in different states and the songs are the ones that take too long, till we start to hate the summer and this twist of fate is great  verse 2 I spent time on your doorstep Just stepping on your toes And its hard to hate your regrets But that’s just the way we know That we’ve learned something from this nothingness That made us feel soo bad And its hard to think that emptiness  Was all we ever had.  Verse 3 And when I see you in the hallways I don’t make eye contact I guess that will just be my way Of saying I don’t want to go back To looking at your eyes soo deeply Letting them take hold of me And how I longed for some acceptance In something I never want to see Again.

      348 and i just came home from steffs house. i sat on her front porch and talked to her for one hell of a long time. but it was great to just have things coming closer to normal with her. and its silly that it takes a late night conversation to get that out. but it was realy great because we both lost a complete month of each others lives that we wont get back but it was nice to hear those stories. as for now. i need to go to bed.  but, the doleful lions actually rule. big time

      my friend peter was all like. stop posting about blair. so i said good. so thats all the mushy stuff i could ever put up. im done with being sentimental. for a while so here is a song called caring is creepy by the shins. to kind of go with the mood.    The Shins   Caring Is Creepy    i think i'll go home and mull this over  before i cram it down my throat  at long last it's crashed, the colossal mass  has broken up into bits in my moat.   lift the mattress off the floor  walk the cramps off  go meander in the cold  hail to your dark skin  hiding the fact you're dead again  undeneath the power lines seeking shade  far above our heads are the icy heights that contain all reason   it's a luscious mix of words and tricks  that let us bet when you know we should fold  on rocks i dreamt of where we'd stepped  and the whole mess of roads we're now on.   hold your glass up, hold it in  never betray the way you've always known it is.  one day i'll be wondering how  i got so old just wondering how  i never got cold wearing nothing in the snow.   this is way beyond my remote concern  of being condescending   all these squawking birds won't quit.  building nothing, laying bricks.

      im to stupid for days like this   i was going to call it a night, and go to bed accepting that my day was just a little bit worse because i didnt get to stand close to you. but then just as i was going to turn of the tv the death cab for cutie song the new year came on. and then all the sudden i was ready for the rest of the day. and ready to live and be again. and i dont want to go to sleep i want to let this sound wash all over me. and now i see what i was meant to do tonight. so. i will see you tomorrow. were going to celebrate my birthday on that day. that should be fun.

      in love with someone else.   so i woke up again to one of urlakis's phonecalls and its always a posotive thing when that happens so he and i sat around with cazy chris vasich. then we went and saw randy zimney and sister bear.  it was cool randy and i had a little ben lee singalong. im going to go practice with the prudes in a little bit and that will fill up the rest of my night i bet. becasue i totally would have liked to see you today but it was busy so its all good. tomorrow is kind of a b day party i think joey and kris are coming in from the city and stuff so it will be my celebration. im pretty excited about all of that. it should be a good time.  so just some open advice for anyone or no one to read. if you like a girl who has a boyfriend. dont, do it to yourself. and i mean everyone likes everyone. i dont want to be captain my girlfriends hot but im sure there are other people who like her and think that im a dick and that shes dumb for dating me. but its stupid to sit and wait out a relationship. i guess though it would suck for anyone to really like someone who is dating someone else. but all im saying is. i love you dude. so i want whats best for you. and it just doesnt feel right.   but thats not really what iwanted to write a long post about.  you have the prettiest hair, and even though it ends up in my mouth i thank whatever i can think of for letting me be in this position. a switch of weight would kill me now. a change in feeling or texture of sound might be too much for me.   i finished my ice cream and walked down to the river. and grace jumped on dons back and this girl was trying to jump on mine but i wouldnt let her. and then i realzied. that on that night at her birthday party when you first jumped on my back as we walked through wet grass all the way to the back of someones house attempting to break in. i kept telling myself that if we did get into a house i would have kissed you. but i probably wouldnt have had the guts to either way. i guess im glad that we didnt get to break into the house. but what im saying is i couldnt let her up on my back becasue i didnt want anything to take the place of how you feel on my back the way i carry you. the way you whisper the way you touch my back. the way you put your arm in mine, the voice you use when you dont want me to tickle you any more. the look on your face when i make mean jokes. the promise of a tomorrow that is even better then today.  the promise of a long post that boils down to how much i like you.  if you get the time check the archives.  because a girl finally said  go

      if you go straight long enough youll end up where you were.    it was nice to see mikey again today and he the randman and i hit up the mall for some good fun. you know how it goes. i feel like an idio when i walk into the mall because frankly i just dont belong around fashion. if you listen closely you can hear the malls heart beat. if you rest your arms on the rail you can feel it swell and creak. its actually quite scary.  theres a smile on my face that keeps me standing up and smiling at my friends and telling them that no matter what the whole world is going to work out awesome in the end. thank you for all of this. i just hope  i can be doing half as much for you.

      that made perfect cents   ummm i noticed today how much ur name comes up in my head.   like everything reminds me of u... and its like.. i have to resist telling the person next me a huge funny story about how u did such and such.. cause i know people dont wanna be round those people who talk about their g/f's all the time...  especially if the person ur talking to isnt in a relationship... it just pisses them off to hear how good someone elses life is.   and if they are in a relationship... they jsut wanna talk about they're own.   all ican say is. there is nothing in the world that has made me happier then you.

      i dont have any pictures of you next to me  i dont have any pictures of you at all  ----------------------  i let you finish my sentence and even though the words you used were not the words my lips were forming they flowed out of our conversation just the same and settled in the air watching us  and we may never be closer then when i hold you from behind as our eyes scan the room looking at photographs and quotes that define you, that remind you that who you are is watching us  and everywhere we go  i search for reflections in car windows and mirrors or puddles and even though you dont know it the thing that gives me  the most satisfaction is watching us   -------------------------  "shut the fuck up" thats what i want to yell at the top of my lungs, why did i let anyone else in on my pain. this is my cross to bear, not his. suddenly the deepest cut is shared with him and he continues to pour salt into it. and i fight back the tears, i want to scream "i love her, and i dont care, i wont care just let it die" but it hangs around my head like a cloud of smoke and it infects my every breath, until you are back in the room.  -----------------

      this is my last song you hear it in my words with every breath i move my hearts tounge but its all fake and its all for girls.  james    is this a repeat, one memory that i have spliced into a different life? a life that you are a part of. i dont hear birds yet. is it really spring? and boys with radios blaring never really talk to each other. and they pretend that they are sharing this song. when they are just wondering about other things. "the blank husband epidemic." i try not to be overly critical but i see girls from time to time and wonder what they are doing with the boy they have thier arm around. everyone should have someone, i just dont always see the logic behind a lot of it.   "if i were sand and you were oceans, the moon would be the reason why your pulled to me."

      so i woke up to my grandfather on the phone. and i talked to him for a little while about things and i explained to him that my mother and father were in maui. and that i dont have school today. i layed around downstairs and james told me to listen to this band so here is their link andthey have a whole album on live feed or whatever so its cool.   urlLink  check this out    so mikey and i went to chill and we decided to hit up the mall just to see what was kicking. and we were on our way to sam goody and from the corner of our eyes we saw some kids, in very silly attire, if i might say, although i was in girls pants and such, not to mention that i walked into holister in holister pants and whatever. so we sat and watched these dance dance revolution kids do what they do and it was funny to see one kid beat another kid then kiss his girlfriend. and dont get me wrong. everyone should have someone they can kiss and feel close to. but seriously, what kind of date would it be if you were like hey baby, im heading to the arcade. wanna come cheer me on? maybe im just cynical or something but serioulsy thats just kind of weird. so urlaks found 2 quarters in his pocket and walks up to a boy who is playing soul calibur and challenges him to a battle. and urlakis says "oh this is the new game i have never played it" so the kid gets a smug look on his face. that is quickly wiped off by urlakis kicking the shit out of this kid. and maybe its wrong of me too be happy with the out come of video games in the arcade but i was proud, becuase urlaks took of his jean jacket and got really into the game and since he trounced the kid he got to play for free and stuff so i sat and watched that. the kid wandered out of the arcade in shame. so we walked into sam goody and were disgusted with the selection. urlakis complained there was no jazz and then he commented on what billy joel was doing in the popular section.  open advice.  she isnt your girlfriend. stop acting like her boyfriend.  so i need to pull my cash together and buy tickets.   take care of yourselves and check out that band. they rule.

      when did my head  start feeling more comfortable  on your pillow? and do things like this ever go back to normal  or will i always miss your bed when i am somplace else?  will i check the room for you? as if by some accident you might show up no matter where i am or what im doing.  and you say i remeber too much. but there is nothing  that i want to forget. ------   "what did you say" i try to listen but my mind runs over story lines and compliments i will never say,  claw at the back of my throat until i clear it. clear you from my tounge. but you kiss yourself right back in. and my eyes close so that you cant escape through them. your perfect reflection in grey blue.

      i looked up, to the place i first remeber seeing you. the spring, two years ago. but i didnt know you then.  and ive looked down from where you stood. with a girl i thought i could love.  watching fireworks. watching faliure. watching a lit cigarette fall 5 stories.  would you jump into my arms from that high. if you knew back then that i would have caught you? -------------------   you put your ear to the rails to check for a train, my father taught me that placing a hand on the cool metal listening closely  closely  and i put my ear to your chest to check for your tempo my heart taught me that placing a hand on the bed sheet listening closely closely  i put my ear to your lips to hear you whisper sentences stolen away, from the others placing a hand on your leg listening closely closely

      i dont know you that well, in fact i have never even seen your face. and since you cant tell me your story i can feel it in the way you fixed your hair in the rear view mirror, so that it would look just the way it did when you left for work this morning. it doesnt tell of the other fingers that ran through it only an hour ago. and you smile on the drive home. you have a secret again. you feel good. of course you feel good. you havent fucked like that since college. and your wife wont do half the things she does. for 7 years you have been in a constant traffic jam, wake up, kiss good morning, shower, glass of juice, drive to work, hate yourself, lunch, hate your wife, drive home, hit the kids, lather, rinse, repeat. and on and on until she walked into your life, and you drum along on the steering wheel to the best of hte 80's 90's and today. you remeber how it felt to be in love. you remember your wedding. but you get happier when she cries, and your kids are starting to act like you. your son called your mom a bitch, he heard you say it, he will be 8 this spring. and every few months you find yourself going to confession and pouring your heart out to a priest, because no one else listens. how many times have you put your hand on the butt of the gun you keep under the bed for protection and thought about shooting her? once.. twice... who counts anymore?

      from the way to get there, to the ride home.  an hour is all it takes to erase days and days of anything bad.   and you all know what im talking about. you have all held your hands on cold steering wheels and known what love is. and god damn if it doesnt feel right.   i want to tell you something big and lovely about an observation that i have made or a picture i have seen in my mind.  but all i have is smiles.  smiles and smiles and smiles.

      i was confronted by one of the people in this world that i hold dear and told that i am an asshole these days. and according to countless nameless sources that i have changed soo much that everyone is noticing. only not in the good kind of change, the really bad kind where people spit on the ground and say, "he has changed" but i have lost touch with the person i was when i came back from ireland. and i want to say soo what fuck you to anyone who thinks im different. but what does that solve. its still me.  yes some things have changed. and for a lot of them i am sorry. if i could change things like this i just might. but as selfish as this may seem im glad to be where i am. and i really thought everyone else might just be glad for me.  but i have cursed the names of boys who ditched me for their girlfriends. i have sworn that i wouldnt be like that.  so where does the solution lie? is there an answer to this question. fifth grade. basement memories. all i wanted. was someone. and i have someone now. and i just dont know how to feel.   and i cant really learn a lesson yet. not just yet.  and if you liked me when i desperatly needed attention and was a crazy guy, then i am sorry that i cant be that for you soo much anymore. but friends like that are a dime a dozen.

      i spend a lot of my time thinking about the next big thing. that is to say i spent a lot of my time looking forward to the next big thing. if i can make it through this week i have the weekend, two more weeks until that concert. this party next month. spring break is coming soon. and with all this waiting for bigger things to happen i found myself missing the point. you cant always multitask and its important to keep your eyes on what is in front of you. things change and what you wanted to be, where you wanted to go, and who you wanted to be there with could be different after one fight, or one night. or anything. yet still sometimes i lean into the sun and close my eyes and imagine myself at 25. and im happy and i have this to look forward to. right?  and when i get to thinking really hard about my future and what will become of me i try to slow down. and really talk to kids in my classes. i try to connect with a life tat i know nothing about in an attempt to put some logic into my own.becuase the girl i talked to today has hopes and dreams im sure, and at night she might look in the mirror and be really proud of herself. i didnt ask these questions. not yet. but i started to learn about this girl. the things she does because of boredom. (the fact that her x boyfriend has a small penis) i didnt ask that she just kind of told me. and i know that if only for a few minutes im looking at the present. and my life is her right now and her life is me. and we are what we talk about.   so maybe instead of waiting for something big to happen to us. we should go out there and make something big for someone else.   i dont want to force you to do anything. but if you would like. complement a stranger tomorrow. and be sure they know you are serious.  "what are we waitng for?" --everyone ever.

      so i had a really cool weekend and it was alot of fun. i had a good time just hanging out and all that kind of stuff. i went and saw in america and really liked it alot. i was on the verge of a little bit of crying but im just a big baby so i think its all the same either way.  i was writing you to see how you are doing. if your feeling any better now then you did last week. i know its hard to live this life.     i just want to let it all slide and move into an apartment and just lay around all day. no need to have a job.  yesterday at church i really wished i smoked cigarettes because i would have walked up to this 30 something year old mom. i would have said "you want to get out of here?" and then we could have sat on the curb and smoked together. i dont know if she smokes or loves her husband but im sure she does both.

      see when you put a shell to your ear it is not the sound of crashing waves your hearing its the amplified current of your own blood stream it was your self pulse that created that post human illusion of me your tireless heart pumping out an ocean of lies and i loosely tried filling impossible shoes resulting in my stumbling as i fell into the trap of making a woman my element now i just cant get comfortable being out of you

      to not want to fall in love when i see what i see everyday when i come home.  i got into a conversation with my mom about compatible personalities and how you stay with someone for 23 years and all that stuff. and i really admire my parents because when they fight they never yell. they both say their sides and then if they disagree they let it stay where it is.  a direct quote  Mom: how much do you love pumpkin pie DAD: well lets put it this way, i hadnt married you, i would have married pumpkin pie   ive just had a really nice nice nice nice day.  and thats all there is to it.

      We danced like cigarettes In urinals A sweeping circle That left us dizzyingly apart  And I watched you walk  Next to me with your arm locked  In mine And never wanted something To feel more permanent  There is an understated grace In how you push me away Because it never fails To draw me closer  ---------------------- I asked you If  When we went to the mall together We could hold hands.  We stood amongst colorful appliances That guaranteed us a better life I wish I would have known that you Could give me the same thing  But with you there is no warranty And the proof of purchase  Is written in letters That I will set a match to  When this ends  We didn’t hold hands that day. It took a few more weeks ----------------- most say its just a fucking pencil --------------------   I wrote with a pencil That you gave me And realized it was  Better then any gift I had ever given you Because this allows me  To write To think To feel To need And correct my mistakes A chance to get every thing right This time around  Im lost without your hand Touching mine Tapping the beat to a song We both like And I want to just stop and scream "this is my life" but I wouldn't believe it I know I have tried And if true love is blind  I would give up my eyes  Because all I needTo see Is just one memory A picture of you and me Kissing in the snow  on my street  -----------------   wide arms i stand i saw you through the window recognized the headlights on your car  and my heart starts beating faster  and i tell them all i need is one touch. i havent seen you in hours  and all i need is one touch.  and you are only  a few feet from me and i try to hold a conversation with a boy and girl i love  but they see my eyes darting figuring times and angles and everything  and my friend peter says to me  go to her.

      its getting bad. i dont really remeber how to spell michael first try anymore. and everyone who has met me after the blog started calls me mikey. and i like it. it was just interesting to see how things change based on the persona that is created in cyber space but here is some open ended advice. to some people if it doesnt apply to you please just disregard it.   if you dont like who you are, change it. i like talking to you but if you are agoing to spend the rest of your life talking about how you dont have the courage to tell people how you feel and stand up for yourself our conversations are going to get repetative and then im not going to want to talk to you anymore. if you are soo scared of being who you are how come you arent scared of being who you pretend to be. that would frighten me more. people see what you put out there. and if they see someone who is just pleasing them they are going to walk all over it.   granted if you act your heart and you are a bitch to people some wont like you, but they will respect you. and which is more important?

      i havebeen thinking aboutsomethings that really bother me. i hate the expression giving it 110 percent  i dont trust anyone who says they gave it one hundred and ten percent. if they say they gave it their all that is much more convincing. i was thinking about this on the drive home. its still too cold for me to love it, i miss ground without ice, and green fields, and clear blue water. what i need is sand beneath my feet. the irish coast with freezing waves and dark water. boys undressing on cliffs and racing towards the water. this is what i miss.  you dont get what you dont ask for.

      So we kissed as the snow fell in the park And I know everything has different parts And I felt like we could beat with the same heart And with you right next to me, anything else would seem too far  It’s a matter of the simple mathamatics The equations that make you soo attractive We try to deny the chemicals It’s just one more case history repeating Where love struck boys find allthey are needing And they release the chemicals   We drove home and the road filled my soul A mess of concrete and glass turned into gold So we pave all our days so they run smooth All I need to beat viscosity is you  I wish you appeared in all my dreams Because I need you next to me when I sleep I cant explain how much it means To close my eyes with you talking to me

      i went over to steffs tonight and there were some people who werent there for the start of it all but everyone fell into step quite nicely.  it was cool.  i kept getting asked where is blair and it is funny how we hold someone responsible for the location of their other half all the time. their lower half.  ive been dreaming all day, we made it half way and summer is almost here. not almost almost but once it gets warm we will hit the road.  this modern thought can get the best of you

      1. take into account that great love and great achievements involve great risk  2. when you lose, dont lose the lesson  3. follow the three r's. Respect for others, respect for self, and responsibility for all your actions.  4. rember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck  5.  learn the rules so you know how to break them properly  6. dont let a little dispute injure a great friendship  7.  when you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it  8. spend some time alone every day.  9. open your arms to change, but dont let go of your values  10. remember that silence is sometimes the best answer  11. live a good, honorable life. Then when you get older and think back, you'll be able to enjoy it a second time.  12 A loving atmosphere in your home is the foundation for your life.  13. in disagreements with loved ones, deal only with the current situation. dont bring up the past  14. share you knowledge. It's a way to achieve immortality  15. be gentle with the earth  16. once a year, go some place you've never been before.  17. remember that the best relationship is on in which your love for each other exceeds your need for each other.  18. judge your success by what you had to give up in order to get it.  19. approach love and cooking with reckless abandon.   ive been trying. its interesting  midnight  rabbits rabbits rabbits

       i have looked back over a lot of my posts in the past few days thanks to some much dreaded free time. and i rarely talk about all the things i really really love about this world. because there are a ton. and i just started thinking about them today as i was driving.  the top of my list  of things that makes me smile is  when a dog has his head out the window of a car. for some reason this always makes a great big smile cross my face. and if any of you are homeward bound fans you will remember when chance has his head out the window and he says bat dog. maybe that started my love of dogs with their heads out of windows.  The second thing that always makes me smile is eating m&m's. I dont think you can eat them in a bad mood. once you start popping those suckers into your mouths then its a change of attitude.  another thing that i realy love is when you tell a friend about a band you like and they kind of dismiss it and then your listening to music and they are like who is this? and lo and behold its the band you told them to listen to. thats great because then you can both enjoy the music.  i always smile when i do something that i picked up from her. and its odd to sort of transform with someone else but it happens so no worries about it. today my shoe lace was coming untied and i remembered a way she showed me to tie things that keeps them tighter and i did it and my shoe was great.  i also really love being on the same page as someone else. soo much so that you know that the other person is going to say and then you beat them to it. thats wonderful becuase everyone just goes i knew you were going to say that.  my jacket smells like bug spray and looks like tent canvas. i dont know where it came from i just know that it is here now and it kept the rain off of me today. and maybe im not thankful enough for things like that.  thank you jackets thank you mom thank you pencils thank you steff thank you refrigerator thank you mikey thank you music thank you guitar thank you picks thank you paper thank you words thank you pants thank you socks thank you grass thank you door knobs thank you sunshine thank you rain thank you mirrors thank you television. thank you blair thank you chris thank you steve thank you jill thank you bill thank you Chris, the long one thank you summer nights thank you don thank you peter thank you rachel thank you krissy thank you chrissy thank you theresa thank you steve thank you b thank you dan thank you all  Rest assured there are more people i could have thanked  ohhh before i forget thank you randy for everything

      so heres something wierd.  i found out yesterday that someone who i thought had given up on me still reads the blog and it was kind of a shock to me. i partially wished this person would have been able to cut me out of thier life just like i did to them. it was just kind of funny.  i already hate distributing pamphlets. its garbage. i hate the job and i wish i could just quit. i know im getting paid to do something extremely easy but i just dont want to do it. and i guess htats just what working is but still its frustrating. we were putting pamphlets at houses and our "boss" hannah's husband was being a wierd guy and was checking our progress and we kind of got yelled at because he didnt see pamphlets at every house. but of course some peopel put pamphlets inside of thier houses once they found them and i put pamphlets under peoples door mats so of course you cant see that from driving by on the street. but no you cant explain that to someone who thinks you are trying to screw them. it would be so easy to just ditch pamphlets but we didnt do that so i feel pissed off that im being honest and working hard and theres a ton of suspiscion. it kind of pisses me off but we will see how tomorrow goes. its just really boring work and its tedious as shit and i really dont want to do it, but its time to stop complaining about that job.  for all of you who believed i would never get a job that has changed. in a few months i will be working at cookie dough creations. the next time they hire people they are going to hire me. im pretty excited about that. it will be a cool job to have this summer because it will be fun and my friends can stop by and visit me if they want. im excited about starting whenever i do wind up starting. its a cool job so im pumped.  thtas all for right now. i dont want to work tomorrow but i feel like if i have to do it i might as well stay up tonight as late as can be  because if im going to hate it i might as well hate it tired and messed up.  if your reading this i love you.

       I’d collapse into your arms if you were here and douse your shirt in tears. I’m assaulted by the verse of peers that stresses, line by line, how anything’s assertable as long as it can rhyme. And they all inhabit fictions like these workshops will inspire...hearts abbreviated to a singular desire.

      soo whats up now. i was asked to write a post about coupling off and it is an interesting topic.   soo my history with the subject starts sometime when vasich got a girlfriend and stopped hanging out with us. this was sometime during junior high. and he didnt fully stop hanging out wiht us. we still saw him a ton. but when boys who want girlfriends are friends with a boy who has one they sometimes accuse before looking at the facts. i am particulary guilty of doing that. and thats really all it ever was was jealousy. this is not true for all people. but sometime after watching say anything and kissing a fool and all these other romantic comedies that i love i started idealizing having a girlfriend. and once i had that vision in my head i no longer saw the coupling off as a bad thing. it was something that i wanted to be a part or. something that i envied.  more to come later. pizza now.

      what do you do when someone you love hates everything about themselves? how do you react to that. the last time my girlfriend was happy with everything in her life was before we were dating.  am i supposed to not read into this a little? should i let this drop? i don tknow where to stand. my eyes are already preparing to cry. i know the second i actually vocalize some words the tears are going to come. so im going to spend as much time as i can just typing. i dont know what to tell you... you the reader and you the inspiration. what can i say? more then i love you?  i could scream it would that be loud enough. to shake you out of your feelings?  and i watch you everyday, sometimes with my eyes closed, but i watch you and my chest fills with you. if im not making you happy please tell me so. i really hope i am. and im sorry if im needy and im sorry if i bug you and im sorry if i cry  and im sorry if i am responsible for you losing friends and im sorry if you arent happy with your life and im sorry you get sick when im around and im sorry that i give you headaches and im sorry that i bring it up sometimes and im sorry that i didnt forgive you right away and im sorry that i led you on before and im sorry that i didnt love your right away and im sorry that i hid my feelings and im sorry that you had to stare at a screen to forget me and im sorry that i dont drink with you if thats what you want and im sorry i didnt go fake tanning and im sorry that i shave when you like my goatee and im sorry that i dont know what you need and im sorry that i dont really know how to act and im sorry you had to kiss me first and im sorry for saying that thing and im sorry for meaning that thing and im sorry for not telling you everything and im sorry for making you uncomfortable and im sorry for proving you wrong on those lyrics and im sorry that i dont listen to you as closely as i should sometimes  because i never stopped to think. someday i might not even get to hear what you are saying.  and im sorry for making you late  and im sorry for just showing up and im sorry for not being there when you need me and im sorry for calling you too much and im sorry for not calling you enough and im sorry for this post and im sorry for telling stories  and we didnt even have a fight. and we didnt break up or anything. so why are my eyes tearing? why do i feel inadiquite?   so if you are reading this everyone else. you can really see it now cant you?  today makes 4 months.  happy anniversery baby.  i love you   "ill love you forever ill like you for always, as long as your living my baby you will be"  goodnight, or good morning depending on when you read this.  ----------------------------------------------------  we were all just foolish kids i guess believing that our love  was more then words and breaths escaping our lips  i believed that my love could move mountains stop traffic save friendships and you once approaced me  with just your love and a list of all the things wrong with her  and i let me feelings . overpower your love for me so do you think you can move mountains? stop traffic?  you need to look on the bright side you told me tonight after my whole life, i had told you that for 2 years i have told you that  my glass is half full my heart is half full but that does not complete me right now  and when i left tonight you said you loved me. and i believe that.  my glass is empty my heart is full   i dont feel well at all right now.  ---------------------   i held onto you hand  and tried to kiss your fingers but you pulled them away soo eaisly  and i tried to hug you but you turned away from me and faced the far wall  "i feel like shit" a direct qoute, how should i feel "i wish i knew what you were thinking"  "i dont know" so it seems and you held me soo close just 3 hours ago  and nothing has changed except the temperature  -----------------------------

      so i checked my email today and i really pissed of someone who read this   I wanted to write you a comment on your blog but I didn't know how. So I sent you this email. I had a hard time swallowing what you wrote on your last poet. It made me sick. And disappointed. Usually you're interesting and open minded. And while you tried not to sound sexist, citing that girls like a variety of boys based on their true identity, you embraced horrible stereotypes. Can anyone help the way they look, even attractive people? Why are the pretty girls so damnable? You make it sound like their beauty entwines poor average joe, and then you root for the underdog, because of course this girl will break his heart. But the girl didn't ask to be pretty.  And then you question why she would date an "unpopular" boy. "is he doing her homework? paying her? make a wish foundation?" And you have to assume that the popular, "hot" girls drink or whatever. "joe bags jeniffer. firstly they dotn ahve the same friends. and joe is probably a pussy and doesnt drink or shit. so what can they do together?" so what? so the hot girls do drugs? can't she be intellectual AND beautiful?  Maybe being beautiful is a curse, to have boys only worship these girls because of physical appearance that people like you can't see past. You wonder what the quiet homely girls are like, but you can't just write off the other girls as a pretty face. So, all the boys should just forget the pretty girls and go for the hidden gem? "it is alright to have a crush on a very pretty girl, we all have been there. But the fact of the matter is most girls arent much more then that." Looks are no indication of what's inside, no matter if you're ugly or not. You're creating some sort of class warfare that only you are superficial enough to see. asking boys to disregard the pretty girls in order to discover a beautiful "spirit" is disregarding potentially wonderful people. you've made your whole point obselete by being a hypocrite. I hope other people reading your blog can think for themselves. Please rethink your dogma.    i find it hard to know where to stand on all this. am i being to hard on girls? bill didnt think so  Vass147: yes youre giving girls way too much credit wen u say   they just have a different set of priorities just as skewed as guys and react differently, but equally inappropriately  thats my piece  soo lets try to solve all this in one sentence shall we?  i dont take back anything i said though, im just trying to clarify  boys and girls are both dumb, and your relationship with someone should be based on who they are not what they look like, also its dumb to place very attractive girls in some sort golden godesses to where boys worship them because that will give them big heads.  sorry for any confusion. and thanks for anyone who contributed thoughts

      ive been spending my weekend well i would say. i had some big idea for a post but i cant really remember it now. i forget what i was thinking. so i will leave you with one thing.  i crossed my fingers as i crossed your lawn and ive been coming over more you got so used to it you can feel me coming on just like a cold taking back tact like a christmas gift to the store he trades in boredom for a cigarette so he can die some more.  cross my fingers as i cross your name out of my favorite song that i should probably play for you but i am not that strong turned a leaf the night you turned to me and told me that you quit and you struggle for the fairytales but i settled for this

      firstly my parents bought 21 acres of land in virginia. they will be neighbors with dave matthews from the band and some author.   so we decided to go on a boys night out type thing. all the boys who used to live in this house. joey jamesy and daddy. so we drove to dave and busters and we bought super power cards and we played video games for soo long.   the best game i played all night was called beach head. and you sit in this red ball that is supposed to feel like a cockpit or something and you tyr to shoot while this ball just shakes your brains out.  eternal sunshine of the spotless mind was amazing

      it seems dumb to try and follow up a huge post with something worth while i know i cant do it.   i have no motivation  just sittin in the basement and trying not to hate kids for talking shit like i did this and that my inteiror monolouge it swings right back like the hook of a song we got these tiny dreams tucked in drawers with our socks i cant wake you screams so i start to throw rocks at your window its late but i need your body pressed next to mine  with my heart in my chest creating beats like sharp, helping me to write  and snakes and sharks, never hesitate to bite anothers boys girl but its alwasy inevitable in this world, where property is unavoidable i need relief maybe a head ache soon and my teeth leaving bites like the crescent moon in  your skin vampires cause we hate the day and night comes, and we still dont know waht to say so wake up im shivering my legs are freezing as i balance akwardly on air conditioning units of time to measure all my love attempts remeber that time when we scaled the pools fence i have some memories that make me feel detached you have my long songs, and all his photographs stop its silly i promise im not jealous but things start to fill me, i love you more then he did stop to feel me, i love you more then he did stop to feel me, i love you more then he did

      any mofo who blogs can tell you that they get ideas in their head and start writing thier post as they are driving or whatever.  and today i was really late for school so i parked on martin avenue. so i had a long walk back to my car after the day had finished and i got to thinking.  i will not put myself above this following catagory of boys. i will not claim to be better then my past. but at least that is in the past.  now fact of the matter is when you like someone you are in almost every case physically attracted to them. with this aside.  what is the deal with most boys? why is it that boys who arent considered popular or handsome like the prettiest of girls? i do not mean to wipe out a whole group of girls with one broad sweep. hell maybe i do. most of those girls are bitches. and all the guys, these less popular, regular, straight forward boys, they dont see it. they sit behind you in classes they sit at your lunch tables. and you like them. they are nice boys. we are nice boys. i dont want to apply myself into this catagory much longer because 2 summers ago i stepped out of this. and dusted myself. but it is only fair for me to put it out there for people to read. the main question i have is why? why? why bother? why try? why worry? why them?  lets say there are 400 boys and 400 girls in the school  i would say 350 of the boys like a group of 20 girls. that is extreme but im trying to make a point.  and girls are different. i would say that from the 400 girls 300 of them like 300 different guys. because girls look at guys for who they are. and if im giving girls too much credit you can tell me.   and it seems like every month all the boys get together and decide who the new "hot" girl is. and then all the  sudden its like oh she is soo hot, yeah man. it happens everyday. who hasnt been at a sleepover where boys start talking about the girls they like.   "my problem is not that the boys like the girls really, i think my real problem is the fact that the boys probably dont even talk to the girls on a daily basis."  how can you like a girl when you dont even really talk to her? how can  you like those girls?  but i will confess. that i have liked those girls in my stupider days.  lets say it works out for one of these boys. and he bags one of these girls. then what? now im not talking about the popular boys. they get to decided who is the new "hot" girl. those boys get props from me. its a big responsibilty. plus the popular boys are the only ones who really get a shot at this new hot girl. and you know it.   but lets just say.  that regular joe or whatever gets with super hot jeniffer. it took me too long to think up a girls name. i didnt want any girls to think they were hot so i tried to pick a name that no one really has. well back into it  joe bags jeniffer. firstly they dotn ahve the same friends. and joe is probably a pussy and doesnt drink or shit. so what can they do together?   and when the word gets around its only a matter of time before the did you hear about joe and jeniffers? starts. we cant resist some good gossip.  but im sure that the rest of you just like me would be like what? why? and we would not route for the little guy. we would jump to conclusions  is he doing her homework paying her? make a wish foundation?  it cant be for his car. those boys dont have cool cars. if they had cool dads who would buy them cool cars they would be the cool boys. but that isnt the case.   luckily it rarely happens.   and lets not shit ourselves. its only because the girls they like are attractive. there is nothing past that. so dont lie to yourself about that. boys want to put thier body as close to the prettiest girl as they can.   and their future wife sits idly by and watches this shit happen. think about it guys.  a girl in your class who isnt one of these "hot" girls could really like you. and really want to be with you. and love you and all that great stuff. and you pay her back by staring blankly at the girl you think is prettiest.    i did it to.   but this shit can stop today. if you let it. i will not pretend that this blog reaches the whole school. or even 20 people. and if you do read this chances are you arent one of these boys. so damn. maybe i should have written this is as an editorial.  so here is the point guys.  and girls  guys: it is alright to have a crush on a very pretty girl, we all have been there. But the fact of the matter is most girls arent much more then that. and if you really really like a girls spirit. she will be the prettiest girl you have ever seen.  Girls:melt off your faces and see who still likes you.  I LOVE YOU  _---------------  you are a life jacket  in calm water a parachute  on the second floor a fire alarm  in a swimming pool  you are more then i ever needed more then i ever hoped for more beautiful then i could imagine.  we sat quiet like a concert and we listened  like mozart -------

      im starting to think that this might last longer then diamonds and volcanic glass  and you are the stories i will tell and the only question now is will you hold my hand as i tell them?  i stood on hot and cold and didnt know how to feel did i want you to wake up? did i need you to kiss me?  but before questions were even stated you had given me answers that made my legs shake  yes im cold. but not that cold. is it temperature?  one day it switched, like the seasons and you were my reason to wake up.  -----------------------

      i dont feel like doing much of anything right now. i feel frozen. i feel like this night could have been flipped through like a photo album. or the scenes in the movie that go by quick and they are just split seconds. a montage.   and the conversation ends when we both hang up the phone. but it continues in my head. and i feel like i am in the scenes taht get cut out of the movies. the periods of extreme confusion when the hero wonders where he stands and what he is doing.   and this is not a power of love post. this is not a tell it like it is post. this is not a poetry post.  my heart will continue to beat for me no matter how hard i want it to quit.   fuck that, this is a power of love post. this is a tell it like it is post. this is a poetry post.  my whole life i have been on display, by my own choice. i am yours to pick apart. i understand this. and i am yours to look down on if you feel you must.  but do not question my love.  i stared down a demon today in the grocery store. i looked him in the eyes. i felt my heart beat get quicker. this is what it comes down to. "you will never love her the way that i do... you lost your chance. and if you fucking regret that its too bad." becuase she loves me.  she handed me a photograph to prove how cute you were. and you were sitting right were i was sitting looking at you. but i know that you never sat there and felt for her the way that i feel for her.  and you have seriously fucked up a life. you are a demon. and i will not pity you. and i will never forgive you for fucking around with a heart as prescious as hers is. and maybe you are paying for your crimes.  you might 0nly get one shot at everything in life. and if you pass that up or fuck it up for that matter i am truly sorry. but i will not let you fuck up my shot.   and here is my realization.  the point i tried making over the phone.  i will not let someone else ruin my relationship. i will not let someone else have the power to make me mad at you. and i love you.  more then my heart can bear.  and you see my eyes watching you and you ask what. but it is hard to find the right words. to explain how you are soo beautiful at 217 or how i can see myself spending every second with you, or how there is not one flaw on your body, and how could you believe such things?   i have given false compliments to girls. i have tried to play angles so that i could get some play, before i even knew what play was. i have attempted to manipulate people. i have done despicalbe things. like everyboy before me i have told a girl she looked good and secretly hoped that for some reason that would trigger a reaction that made her want to sex me up. but that is not what this is.   i would compare this to a cry for help. if only help was what i needed.  the tattoo you gave me now looks like a lion. a teardrop fell on its face and spread out the ink making it look like a mane.  "i have found the girl that i was put on this earth to be with. i will let nothing step in the way of that"

      is some show on the television dedicated to swingers. or something. a woman picked a man and a woman and they all climed into a car together.  the fifth wheel where strangers become lovers, and lovers become suicidal exes. or something like that.  that is terrible...   its never too late to look around at the tile on your floor or your lights and realieze how beautiful the world is

      i cant remeber if i came right out and said it. it may have been hidden in 1000 poems composed so she would get that look on her face and know that i was thinking about her no matter where i was.  the only thing seperating us  is a pane of glass but we both know that it isnt really keeping me from you when i speak i feel your words  rolling off my tounge. filling the air with the way you look  people have stopped asking me how i feel its hidden in my walk and it shows in my eyes. i feel alive, i feel electric i feel like screaming your name loud enough so you can hear it countless blocks away. and fall asleep knowing that if i had a voice i would swear i love you.  -----------------------------  I am in love with you...

      i treated you like a swimming pool  and weeks before it began i peeked over the fence and watched other boys, test the water take a step into the baby pool step back. back back  and i watched and waited.  these boys attempt to get used to the water achieve some kind of happy medium between their temperature and yours.  i climbed the fence and my eyes moved from the boys to the water  a piercing blue, the color you wished your eyes were  and now im sprinting towards the pool  signs say no running  a whistle blows  but i am in flight and before my lungs can grab air all sound is lost and you have swallowed me

      ive seen both sides now.  lived the life of the loser and spent time sitting on park benches alone wishing more then anything that some girl who gives a damn about me walks up and sits down next to me. comments on my shoes and then spends the rest of her life in my arms. i have longed for this. i have cried for this. i have written for this. i have begged for this. and now i sit in ths chair. and all the static that once crowded my mind has cleared. because above all else i have you.   "wait mike, you might not always have her"   but the fact of the matter is. i love the parade. and i really like the rain. so dont bother with your grey clouds. you cant block out a sun that shines brighter then any other star trapped in this sky. shining day and night for us to see. and all through our daytime we dont see it. and then night hits. and you see the stars. i have seen them from every side.  on my back in a parking lot on a mountain in montana on a tropical island over the hills of ireland from park avenue from georgia from kentucky from ohio from california from florida from washington state and DC next to countless people  and once on a patio. complete.  but you outshine it all  "think of all the things you did before, write them all in a letter that says reborn"  ------  there are two dream catchers hanging from your ceiling yet i made it through the ropes and landed on your bed. dreaming my own dreams that i fail to remeber  when i wake  to a radio blaring static and panicked kisses that fill my eyes with glass freeze them in this moment one green light 4 number eights changed into time  its time for me to go.  there are two dream catchers above your bed yet all my dreams come true without fail.  --------

      i got home from school and a piece of me was missing.   i ate dinner when i got home and learned one of the lessons that "boys should know"  my mom has a campaign to teach me how to survive in the real world. so i have been taught some serious lessons.  1how to make an omlette 2how to make grilled cheese sandwiches 3how to make a bed (the good way) 4 folding clothes so they fit  5 properly fluffing pillows 6 filling out a check 7 writing a thank you card 8 clipping my nails (the good way) 9 washing my face (with numerous multi color liquids) and  the 10th thing now which is how to make a crescent dog.  which is a delicious lesson to learn.  so i called steff and i picked up here and j mcd and we went to wendys then best buy then we were driving to see the crucible. and i reached an intersection and was forced to make the eaisiest descision of my life. turn left and dont see blair or turn right. so obviously i turned right and we picked her up and she came with us.  the play wasnt that good.  i loved the acting, it was fabulous. the story line just didnt hit me wherei wanted it to. although there were some really good quotes.  something like "each time i have kissed you lips i kissed them with suspiscion" thats good but trust me it doesnt apply.  but all and all a good day.  the streets at night look like christmas lights that burn soo brightly they glow and theres somethings you should know when this gravity takes hold.

      the prudes broke up today. music is not dead forever i know but it was a band i was glad to be a part of while it lasted. there was a lot there and i really liked it. so thanks to anyone who came out to the shows and learned the hooks. I had a really good time with the band and i think all the members who helped out in any way can say they are proud to be prudes.

      i drove home some boys after one acts and i heard some comments that startled me and also made me laugh. ANd its not appropriate and its not in good taste but this website doesnt have to always be nice.  so we are driving past a playground and a boy makes a comment not directed towards the girls there but you get the drift.   he then says "you gotta get there before the hair" and im like what. and i started to laugh and then he continues by saying "once they learn how to crawl they are in the right position." and that just kind of did me in.  so after dropping him off i decided to hit up the library(my personal music headquarters) and i picked up  No doubt -rocksteady The donnas- spend the night Primus-tales from the punch bowl Brothers gonna work it- A dj mix album by the chemical bros and The cranberries- wake up and smell the coffe.  so thats what im up to right now.

      i was driving home today wondering about what i would type up when i found my way to blogger next. and i was thinking about this bumper sticker infront of me that said "got jesus?" Now i understand if someone is religious i myself believe in god but i dont know if my devotion is strong enough to put his name on the back of my car.   yet parts of me feel as though my devotion is stronger for not having recieved his name at some arts and crafts store that is trying to sell his image on hacky sacks and stuffed plush dolls. Frankly Jesus does not play with purple kittens outfront of your house with your daughter.   But before stumbling upon jesus on the bumper i had to drive behind a very old man. And im not epically busy all the time. I usually can stop and smell the flowers soo to speak but this guy was driving soo slow that i was on the verge of honking. And most of you know how slow i personally drive so you ahve to then get an idea for how slow this old timer was really driving. He wasnt even driving all that safely he was taking turns that made me nervous and not driving on the right side of the road.  (side note. if ever in england dont tell them they drive on the wrong side of the road. Just try to explain to them they drive on the "other" side of the road) so my driving odessy continued and i pull up to a stop sign that is close to my house. now i beat the woman who was there to the stop by a good 3 or 4 seconds i had enough time to come to a full stop. so as im pulling out into the intersection to turn left there are some kids waiting to cross the street where i was trying to drive. and this woman is waving them across. Now i understand you want to be nice but it was my turn to go and you put these kids in danger if i wasnt watching the road. So next time you come up to an intersection if you are not the first dude there dont try to run the whole show.  take care.   mikey

      So as much as i have tried to avoid this post i fear i can no longer dodge the issue.  I Mike swanberg Got a job.  and i know there are those of you who figured it would never happen. and i must admit i didnt think i was capable of it.   so today i went in and learned how to make a plethora of things buy combining cookie dough, ice cream, syrups, shake base, strawberries, milk, pineapples, malt mix, cappucino mix and love.  it was really a good time and i had fun. mucho mucho fun. thats all for right now

      i put a link right  urlLink here   i feel that i must reply to this because its about me. If you havent read his post yet this might not make sense.  My first point of business is there is no way our old group can just stick together with each other after we are all in relationships. Its too hard to do because lets say i have 10 friends and my girlfriend has ten freinds how do we decide who to hang out with. either my friends or her friends get alienated. And as much as i would love for all my old friends to be able to hang out with my girlfriend that isnt really possible. and im sure she feels the same way but you have to give up some things.  and its odd when you make someone your element. because you never want to be out of them, sage francis said something about that. and im not going to bullshit you. it takes about two minutes for me to miss her. and  the problem  is i cant save it for my own time because this is my own time.   i dont think i can get all that deep but heres what im thinking.  i will only get soo much time with her. X years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds. And if i dont take every single second for all its worth i have cheated myself.  so sorry but i just hope you understand where im coming from. and that is next to her.

      i dont have all that much to say....  i was thinking about a church camp i went to  and how religious i felt while i was there. and how for a few days i thought maybe i could feel god or something. and then i found out that they were using the same tactics that brainwashers use to get people to do what they want.  oh my god.  why do you hide yourself from us.

      i usually try to post everyday but somethings i just am not capable of really typing about.  I dont ask why.   someone asked me about him this week. and my only response was. "you know how nice of a guy chris is?... well he learned it from greg"   Greg, Im extremely honored that i got to know you. when we meet up in heaven im sure we will have a lot of stories to swap. you always treated me like a little brother, you always made me feel welcome. So although i never got to say it while you were here with us. THANKS

      the post about listening got cut off short as i heard my dad tell me to go to bed. apparently being up a 12 on a school night doesnt fly with those two.   but i feel like im listening better in the halls and if its evesdropping, which it probably is, its extremely interesting to hear what people are saying. they are dumb a lot of the time. and im sure there have been 1hundred million times i have said dumb  things in the halls and kids have looked at thier friends and said what the fuck.  "i laid out all day and my sister got more tan then i did. and she didnt even try to tan" i heard crap like this all day and it was soo frustrating.  i dont want to get into religion. but i watched this show on evolution in school and the ignorance of the christians is really bothering.  and im a christian. so i dont hate them. i just feel really fortunate i was raised in a family where i could question without answers getting shoved down my throat.   final thought. i hate having wet clothes on at amusement parks

      i feel uncomfortable in my skin. i have been reading nonstop for about two hours and annotating  the perks of being a wallflower . i really love the book and am extremly thankful that joey bought it for me two christmasses ago.  music changes people. chances are if you are reading this that music changed you.  but here is what has really been on my mind.  Have i just been turning off the background sound? have i been deaf my whole life? I give  a lot of people credit for opening my eyes, but you opened my ears.

      start with your shirts. how many shirts are in your room? how many rooms are in your house? how many houses are on your street? how many streets are in your town? how many towns in your county? how many counties in your state? how many states in the country? 50 but you get the point how many countries in this world? thats a lot of fucking t shirts.  do you believe that life has brought you to this point in your life? are you in control of all of this? did the first conscious thought that you had shape your whole life? if you had only studied your spelling lists in 2nd grade would you be a different person? if i hadnt moved all those times would i have ended up here? would i have a blog? would i write? would i think?    telephones. you press buttons and are connected to any house that has one. and this blog.  i can just type it and you can all read it thanks to wires and magic and stuff.   i had deja vu today. and someone told me its only a chemical misfire in the brain that makes us think we have seen something before. that it is really nothing but chemicals. but do you really believe that? because i knew that moment. i had seen it in a dream 4 weeks ago. and i already know the conversation before it happens. but what if i join in. or worse yet.  what if i did somethgn that i know i didnt do in the dream? does that change the future or just prove my dream wrong?  something tells me i will never solve this.  listen to deja entendu    do you believe in free will? as you are reading this you had the choice to choose if you read my blog or not. you could decided to see if this was a longer post and just say fuck it right? or were you eyes meant to read it? and you can dismiss this as nothing which im sure a lot of you will do. but that is supposing that a lot of people read this. but let me ask you this. would you have dismissed it no matter what? lets say you think you have free will? could your free will just be you making the descions you were always meant to make? And i could go outside right now and look at the moon but is that what im meant to do?  i dont have any answers to these questions.  and where does god fit in to all of this. im sure he has a part .

      I had work at 12 but after an hour i got to go home because it was raining gatos y perros and frankly you dont work in that weather. The mexican guys who work in our shop are really funny. THey are all very very nice to us and today the one guy asked us to make him a cappachino slurpee thing so we were happy to oblige.   just in case you like three ninjas movies they have the first one on dvd at best buy for 5.99  "oh love of mine, wont you condescend to help because im stupid and blind."

       Fishing for my keys outside of your front door in the diesel-dark slush of a cold November night. The rumble of the wind absorbs each passing sound, but somehow you’ve got me believing in a silence that’s not born of solitude, but from compassion left just holding its breath. But gravity won’t fail to make its presence felt or to wage war on unmedicated sleep. Its merciless advance muscles me aside into the sharp nape of a snowdrift. If I make it through this winter...if I make it through this winter. If I make it through this winter, I think I’ll be okay. The few remaining birds, they leap from leafless trees to circle right above us, and, you know, their patterns are so strict, they seem etched into the sky. Oh, you squawking, starving heralds of impenetrable darkness all day long...and of the chemicals that set with every sun. So while drivers skid to stops and take down license plates, their patience worn and weathered as their skills, my own nerves bend and fray like branches glazed with ice...until I see you trudging with me. Chorus. Last year’s robbery, this year’s absent friends: they all linger in the scars on every wall. And there’s nothing left to take; I found solace in that. But now I need something worth losing.   that is the paperbacks i wish i was that good

      everything is going good. i went out to the mall with rachel and we got to hang out and i did some shopping for my daddy and for blair both of which have birthdays within 2 days of each other. sometime this weekend daddy and the boys are going out to go-kart and it will be amazing. i love go-karting because its the best time in the whole world. well maybe not in the whole world but its really really really really fun.  i remember one time i had the slowest of the three cars that james dad and i were kicking and i came from behind and won the race. i was very proud and the best part about go karting is. we all finish the races look around and say again.  a lot of my life is spent looking around at the really fun things i just did  again

      so i was just wanting to tell you all things. but i have been busy but now that i am not quite as busy i have time to share some stories with you.  life is full of little surprises that never fail to leave me smiling. i was driving home when out of the corner of my eye i see two girls who couldnt be more then 9 with a little lemonade stand. and as i drove past i looked back at garage sales i have had and other endeavors so i pulled into a court and turned around. as i climbed out of my car and started walking towards them they seemed very excited. i handed them fifty cents and asked for a cup. they had trouble deciding who would pour and who would hold said cup so it tipped a little. but there was no harm done. i said thank you and climbed back into my car. as i was driving a way i said goodluck. and this littlegirl yells back  you were our first customer. and that made me smile. 50 cents may not go that far these days but its enough to get excited about. i think i have forgotten that.  when life deals you lemons. make someones day

      there are a lot of people who have changed some and i know we all have to change and shift because thats what darwin says we will do, or at least our kids will, or our kids kids. mutation. the boy jill met 2 summer ago isnt me. the boy who proposed to jami rubin on a bet (i also had a huge crush... that lasted a few years) isnt me. the boy who wrestled in junior high isnt me now. We have all changed and it is evident in some of our friends more then others i would say. but its a shame its most evident in my enemies. and its not really my enemies.   there are people who i have looked at very close just to see a face below the mask. But we all hide ourselves away to some point.  i am not a totally open book, because i want you all to think that i am really cool and smart when you read this. and i know that you dont really think that but wi couldt write this if i thought you didnt think i was smart or clever or something. see this is the kind of things i keep to myself.  but its strange because sometiems i look back to nights. when a girl i used to like and i stalked through our streets and talked. well at least i know i talked.   Its funny if someone doesnt say anything you assume your having the best conversation ever. and i am guilty of just talking talking talking. i would talk your ear off if you let me. i promise you. i try to remind myself to slow down and be like "what do you think" becuase like most people, or at least my vision of most people i usually think im right.  For some reason there are certain people that i try to not appear ignorant infront of. AND of course i dont ever want to look dumb but when i talk around Ashley Kaiser i watch my words to not sound like an idiot. and yes i know you are probably saying "why her?" and i wish i knew. she just gives off one of those vibes where i feel that i need to respect her even if some of her colums in the school paper made me upset. some people just give off very strong vibes and command my respect, so i have to give it to them. its very strange. There are also certain people who i have to cover my back once i make fun of them, i have to make sure they feel good about themselves after i say something. The one who comes to mind most is boznos. because i make jokes but i really like him a lot and i want him to be sure that i like him because it sucks if someone makes a joke that makes you feel bad. its strange growing up with joe and james. it got me thinking on my feet. and i know that back then it was like "your gay" and then i would be like "no you are... you big gay" i just remembered this time i wanted to get james in trouble on kwaj.   For some reason us brothers were left alone at home with joey at home in charge of us. so that made him able to put us in our rooms. and i wanted to get james in trouble because i had broken the weiner piece on my gijoe because of him. and i was pissed. so we were arguing and i realized if i gave him the bait he woudl take it. so i called him a pussycat and lo and behold he called me a "pussy" and that was enough to get him grounded. but we were really mean to each other about 7 years ago. i remember the fights in florida and when we first moved here. and joe never got any shit at all. if only james andi would have teamed up against him. we could have taken that jerk ass down. because he got to make fun of both of us.  next time i see joe im punching him. it would mean a lot to me if all of you did the same.

      i know its a little early to be thinking about summer but i have a pretty big trip that is occuring right in the beginning of my summer.the swanberg family + mike and chris vasich are heading to virginia to scrape a layer of paint of of a house and apply a new one. of course this is only one of our tasks. there will surely be hundreds of other things we will do to fill the 3 weeks we will spend cut off from naperville. its all to easy to put this town down. i know that. but it is nice here. and there are some really nice kids with really good ideas and actions and i miss it when i am away. but this trip has been on my mind alot. thats why im typing about it.  in just a few days i will have been dating a girl for 6 months  lets break this down  183 days 10980 hours 658800 minutes 39528000 seconds  7905600 breaths 9882000 blinks 49410000 heartbeats 2000000 babies born in the usa about 7000000000 hot dogs eaten.  when you look at it like this its a really long time.

      below this are some raps that ive been writing for the platinum playaz album which is going to be really really awesome. but aside from that. i had this thought today.  in james bond movies, and in all action movies, and in a lot of other type of movies the hero always gets taht one kiss before he goes off to tackle whatever is placed in front of him. he starts to walk away from the heroin whos shirt is half torn by now exposing clevage and then he turns around, and remembers taht he may only get one kiss for the rest of his life so he better make this one count. so he grabs her by the waist and pulls her in for this 3 second kiss while whoever is dying slowly some place. And it would be interesting if the hero breaks through the door right as the person he is saving gets shot in the head. do you think he says to himself, i probably shouldnt have gone back for that kiss? or would it never cross his mind that that would buy him some more time.   on top of this, hallway kissing. i used to frown on it when i had no one to kiss but now i dont mind it, and i understand that no one should be making out and you shouldnt be like crazy and stopping traffic or laying down but a little peck between classes doesnt hurt anyone and probably helps us learn better.   we are forced to be the hero's in these movies. so treat every class like its an evil lair. and take your kiss, then rush off to save the world.      crossing out chores on my to do list pluggin my ears at the church music while those with golden crosses just cross their arms and you say "cut your losses whats the harm?" and i cover my eyes to block out the sunlight no time for ray bans or to get my clothes right i stumble out of bed and into my nightmare cheacking myself in the mirror so that my hair looks naturally unruly just like my ego i will hold onto my anger till vouge says lets go nobody knows how to please my girlfriend like cosmo as they pass out locker room tips that my mom knows ohhhh its the same old story like that juliet take a dagger right into you if your upset a lost love is reason enough for suicide wait if thats the case i cant count the times i died so what if girls dont treat you like your soo great? grab the problem in your hands, and masterbate thats all you want right, its not about the connection? its how long you can maintain an erection and im guessing if you got your shit figured out you know theres more then money to rap about like iced up watches and diamond rings and about the perks that the drug game brings but thats a joke, nobody cares about the benjamins most of america is trying to pay their rent again but not me, i was born with a father who hack'd it pushed me up into a higher income tax bracket and i work a job for extra cash, not because i need the money if you ask me if i pay for gas, ill just look at you funny im a privilaged kid from the burbs who buys discount shirts take away from the poor cause my libido hurts if i dont look like the others walking down the halls and ive got 2 brothers who taught me it all like how to make fun of strangers and shoot basketballs or how to set up camera angles and what the fucks a bong? hand over fist is how im living you just gotta take while they are still giving.   ----------------------------   CONFESSIONS OF A WHORE MONGER fiction   i poked my head under your bed sheet much like i did last week  to try to find some dreams you were not telling me you told me you always forget them or at least that you left them someplace where the blankets try to meet your skin i got these questions you  have answers and my fucking hands hurt from massageing your breasts looking for cancer and all your problems lump together how about this shitty weather i read in the news its not getting better  i doubt the sun will ever shine again i doubt that i will rhyme again the day a barrier is put between our hands its a confession no ones listening no wonder nitro glycerin  explodes in schools with girls yellin "did you say something" im working on cardiovascular trying to be more masculine i go to the gym but nothings happening my left arm still has nothing on my right cause of lonesome nights when girls didnt take me aside  to say "i would like to pleasure you orally" but im not a whore you see your not my boyfriend but you smiled at me and since my father never gave me the time you will suit me just fine ive had this complex since i was nine no love was given in my childhood days you know what they say All thats gold fades away and like necklace from a quarter machine you rust and im standing above you who can you trust and you look into my eyes but then i come and this all over just as its begun

      my band played a show and i think it went really well we got some good feedback and thats all that really counts i dont know what some people thought of us but go figure. after the show i went to portillos and then hung out with blair. yesterday morning (saturday) i went to eat all the pancakes and sausages i could. which is six, and then neil blair and i went to the park and hung around and had a good time. it was the first time i actually kissed someone in a tree so that was a plus. we were feeding sausages to geese and it turns out once they get a taste for meat they like to attack and kill people. namely us. so once we got surrounded we had to run away. i went and saw don play waterpolo dvc style. it was great they made state so that will be awesome. i had to work last night which was great. it was really really really busy but it kept things interesting and fun.  and today was mothers day and all that jazz. i got my mom and pretty candle and holder. she says the candle i bought her is decorative so she wont burn it. i say i wasted some cash on a shitty candle. but she said she likes it and she said she loves me. and i would say thats enough to make it a good mothers day.  i hope you all had good weekends.

      i was driving home from blairs house and i got to thinking about how i felt nights leaving theresa's. and there were a few of those nights i admit and maybe thats what i want this post to be about.   an honest portrayl of what happened between us.  no not what happened, just what is going on.  i know most of you who read this know the story already, or at least parts you heard from me or from her. im pretty sure most of them are true. eg, answering machines its just the guy i was.  but apart from all this i want to apologize to theresa. and i want you all to know im doing it.  because i did care alot about you, and even though that isnt as evident now back in the day you meant a whole lot to me. just ask steff if you dont think its the truth.  so for everything, thanks  you were a good friend when thats what we were.

      ignorance isnt bliss.      i will pace the hall back and forth until they call my name and ask me why i came  and my mind went blank as i sped through things i never meant to thank  you for all the moments shared you never said you cared but we all knew we all had to it was an aura around your form glowing white and warm in summer nights  and streetlights bleach out feelings back from ireland im lost i should have kissed you thats just what i thought.  and what could it cost me but a friendship that im sometimes prepared to lose but i will never forget you.  ------------------------------------------------  i felt good about the weight of the knife in my hand. the retractable blade. i felt powerful. whittling away at sticks on the back porch, wondering how you took one to your skin. and once the oxygen hits your blood it turns red i heard.

      NEver be boring  we walked around until you get tired  and laid on the grass, started a fire with just our eyes , and a book of matches and i felt soo far, from all those cool kids night on the beach, the stars shone rhytms pebbles found feet, to go along with them and i touched the moon with little caution came back to town you had already lost him  refrain and when it falls apart on you youll know when it falls apart on me i'll go memories of you and me apart using my own pen to break my heart.  our shadows cast, across your blanket if there is a god, i would like to thank him for all he's done, for all hes given this life of mine, this life were living fell into you, ass backwards and broke you touched my leg, laughed at all my jokes my room is full with pieces of you and theres no doubt that i Fuckin love you  second song COAST BY  when we kiss its, just soo perfect, like an instinct, left on my lips ive got nothing. i can trade in, just some poems, inked on my skin your soo pretty, your a painting, epic beauty, im contemplating laying on my side, in the art museam, i have problems, you just never see them we are all artists, are crafts are different, i try to capture, adolescene its soo easy, to write what you know, words like i love you, outlined in the snow.  refrain and what you see is what you get you told me then you hid yourself in the books you like to read.  verse two  its still raining, its still april, i learned how to be, with a girl, with out fearing, loss of fealing, its your glow thats, soo appealing your a lighthouse, im a lost ship, off the coastline, trying to make it to safe harbor before the waves hit, to break my back and leave me without this. all ive searched for, i have gatherd, learned a lesson, whats the matter? isnt a question, with an easy answer, there are no words left that can save her.    DONT FALL ASLEEP please  our eyes found photographs,  of me when i was young a model of my past,  with a dream of what id become and you kissed my cheek,  to watch me smile its been a long week and its been a while...  refrain this is where we draw the line if it isnt love then your wasting time this is where i break you heart  because i let you break mine and this is my final plea an attempt to tell you just what i mean you are the ocean floor  so cold and dark that i want more  verse 2  i tore my words apart and left them scattered on the floor you tore yourself apart because theres not much left any more we are the peter pans a generation that just wont grow up and its our final stand let the world know we dont give a fuck   Filibuster  ill ask for forgiveness just this once for all the shit that i have done, to you please, just take my wrists and sit with me because i dont ever want to leave i know nothing else would do what i have, is fingers leading up to hands that find their way to your back. to rest i fear, no one will ever know were here as you softly whisper in my ear, you were the best.  refrain you fell as broke your neck claimed youd never climb that high again the oxygens too thin and all your photos are of him  my past, is a collage of broken glass and girls who never did move fast anyways and you screamed, why would you want to be with me? i have nothing for you you see, just these bags  that i keep, under each one of my eyes that are as blue and cloudy skys, full of lightning so lets go, up the the park after this show and we will kiss until we know, that we like it  MAN OF WAR  and its been said "im sorry: and "i know" i should at least, be grateful that you showed.  Refrain  and it seems like one too many times that i wrote you in to all my rhymes fuck you now its done and it seems that just your memory's the only thing that is good enough for me at least we had some fun  verse your heat is flowing into me im falling just like mercury and i dont know what to believe theres somethings i never said i need sleep i miss your bed so why wont you flow into me?  verse 2 i trapped you in all my songs my friends all asked me what was wrong but they know i just dont belong there is mercy in each breath you take but when you sleep i hope you never wake and now you see whats at stake.  i never thought i would come down to this i swear it. but you dont hear it.

      that im just 17. and that she is just 16 and that a lot of my friends are just those ages. Because it makes sense to consider ourselves much more mature then we are. When i was little i watched shows like saved by the bell and family matters and it was eaiser to relate to the highschool characters not the kids who were only in 5 minutes of the shows. and never really in saved by the bell i know., but you get what im saying right?  our age isnt really relevant right now. if you want to drink you dont have to be 21 if you want to smoke you dont need to be 18 it just doesnt really matter.  so remeber when i talked of not putting poetry up. well i didnt compile a book or anything so im just going to start posting poetry again.  WHAT time is it? i wonder. but it seems such a chore to lift my head. to try and make out the numbers.  I can feel your absence in the whole room it resonates with the void that you left and your sheets feel rough against my skin and my head feels as heavy as the weights you carry around tied to your past  if we could throw off the handcuffs that others have placed soo securely around our wrists we just might be able to hug in a fashion more convincing  -----------------------  how dare i lay there with my back to you greedily absorbing lyrics wondering if you love me  and i created a test  i would lay here. and if you didnt come hug me if you didnt show any effection i would know that i mean nothing to you  and my blood was full of fire or something like cigarette smoke  i was a body full of hate, full of fear full of confusion  and then you came upon me  as swiftly and efficiently as a cold and knocked me out  my eyes lost focus to your kisses. i was hollow

      i left the ocean  for puddles large enough to catch the reflections of my best friends  in photographs.  in the time it would take me  to tell you my story  you would lose interest you would thumb through your stuff  i told myself my story once in 7th grade  with a blacklight on in my room shades of purple suddenly i was more then me  i was smarter.  but i fell asleep and left it all unfinished  picture yourself far from here.   someplace where you define you.  name yourself.   -------------------------   i was balencing on bricks with my arms spread so wide like an airplane or a bird something so hollowed inside  talking endlessly out loud letting my voice fill the void left by what you used to fill because i have little choice  but to love you like i do with out questioning it more to blindly stumble foreward through the shadows on the floor  left by bodies that at midnight take off clothes and climb into bed and if you were here tonight i wouldnt fear being dead  because you are the rest that im not getting your the sleep thats in my eyes you are reasons i keep living you are my goodnight  and a kiss will be an answer for as long as my voice can raise at the end of every sentence theres a part of me that stays  tucked inside some of your pages just my pencil or my pen with a heart thats made for breaking and a body meant to bend  and its such a simple story told by everyone i know we arent much more then ourfoot prints that keep getting filled in by snow  and now my eyes start working backwards losing sight of what i need and my ears cant really hear what they are trying to say to me  because i love you and i need you and i dont know which is worse becuase what i have is a blessing but they all call it a curse    well   this proves that i dont NEED YOU  like i thoguht i might but i love you like i knew i would  love mike

      here i am. in this little public library featuring probably the most exotic animal this town has ever seen. parikeets. or maybe teenage boys who have tight t shirts and are not wearing timberlands with no socks and jerseys. this town is odd. this state is kind of messed up. i understand that this is jsut what you get some places. napervilled is nice. thats all im saying, so any of you stupid babies who complain that you are sheltered. this whole town is excited because some boats are going to carry fake cargo down river and this is like how it used to be here. when people still shipped. when land was still ours. we have built out as far as we can go. and now we must build up. up and up. but i dont want to be a part of all of this. i want to go somplace where the horizon isnt a dream. where i can see where my world ends. where i can see the girl i love everyday. pipedreams?  i have scraped paint now for days and days and the house is gettign closer and closer to done. but i am burned out. wake up scrape eat scrape nap scrape dinner wait call blair read sleep repeat.  but im halfway done with all of this. soo it will be over.   we are all prisioners of pride.  i love you  mike out

I LOVE YOU

      when i was little i spent a lot of time looking up to my big brothers. its hard being the third in a string of very talented very loud boys. and my place was never cut out as i was little. i was constantly trying to define myself in front of them but it constantly failed. for the first 11 or so years of my life i was an annoying little rat that bugged my brothers to death. and all because i wanted them to think im cool. but i wasnt cool, i really wasnt. and not to sound like some guidance counselor but you need to be okay with yourself before anyone thinks your cool.  i remeber you said once that you biggest turn on was confidence. and i have heard that a lot since then. you cant just hide yourself away from the world and expect everyone to love you. the person they see isnt really you.   and one day i woke up and decided to live my own life. it wasnt etched out by my brothers paths. i will not direct movies. i will not play aaaaaalllloooootttt of basketball. but we all sing. and we all write. and on that level we are the same. each one respecting the others for what they have written. for what they have sang. but i am me. and no one else in the whole world will ever be like this. and you are you, and no one will ever be like you again, so step up to what you have, and flash that smile that means the world to us.

      i was thinking about this as it was driving.  a woman was riding behind her daughter on bikes. i just got to thinking how proud i would be if i was that woman. i cant wait to have kids. i know it wont happen for a long long time but i really want to have kids. think of how amazing it would be, you have been raising a kid for 6 or 7 years and they finally get how to use thier legs and arms to control their bike.   i cant think right now.   school is justabout over

      perhaps i have had everyone figured out all wrong? sometimes i really hope that is true. i hope that everyone has the same thoughts and some just say it more then others. i mean i wont ever be really into basketball games or stuff but those thoughts are fleeting. i was thinking. Some girls chatter about purses for hours and that seems dumb to me. but i could talk for hours about lyrics john k sampson wrote and compare them to the lyrics of other writers i admire and for those girls they would be just as bored as outsiders listening to thier conversation. I dont care about purses or cheerleading and they dont care about skateboarding or songs but why did i think that made me smart and them dumb? when did i get the impression that something along those lines could put me ahead of them? Igot to thinking recently that maybe i was thinking on a higher plane then some others. but i have begun to think it is all one plane. and we are just at different places of it. everyone using the same amount of thoughts just in different places. as long as we all have a common knowledge we can make it.  Be nice to people you know, and be nicer to those you dont know.  goodnight

      1. boys with long flowing hair.                 now i understand that everyone has the rights to thier own haircut. and if they feel like they should have hair that goes all the way down to thier shoulderblades then that is fine. but i dont have to like it. in fact i very much dislike it.  2. mustaches/most facial hair. it always bugs me. i had a teacher once who had this bushy huge mustache and he thought he was just soo great and he would stroke his mustache and look down on the whole class and it kind of spoiled mustaches for me  3. when songs i really like get put into mtv shows.. as much as i want to be happy for the band tat is getting paid tohave their awesome song played  the fact that it is being played while an awful girl digs through the rooms of three guys who talk about her booty just makes me sick.  4. i dont like it when my shoes start smelling. and i know if i wore socks i wouldnt have this problem. but the fact of the matter is its soo easy to just put on a pair and run out the door. its such an easy easy thing.  5. i have to wrap this up. i for sure dont like seventh heaven. who shoots a preist honestly?

      i woke up at nine thirty and took a shower. got into some clothes that i would later forget about and climbed into the car. i slunk into the freezing cold dental chair and sighed, wondered how long this whole thing would take. the woman tied a rubber band around my arm and stuck a needle in. is that what it would be like if heroin was legal? bars you could do it in. with nice nurses to tell you to calm down. she placed an oxygen tube over my nose and told me to breathe in if i liked to. i think it was a trick. i dont know if i would have been knocked out had i not breathed soo deeply and all to prove it didnt bother me.  i woke up with one thought on my mind. where are my teeth? my parents said that is what i asked for right when i came to but my mind is kind of a blur.  i remember getting in the car, but not getting home. i remember takin off my sweat pants, but not putting them on.   i dont really know much.  all i think is that it is strange when people expect you to feel worse then you do.  like right now. i feel like im at a funeral for someone i dont know and everyone is really concerned that im okay about the death. its an odd and out of touch feeling.  &nbsp; i wish vicadin did more to me, all this hype, i dont even feel like a fourty year old woman with a husband who doesnt love her. what a rip off.  &nbsp; sleep tight my love

      to be a rock star. maybe not even&nbsp; a star but just to be in a band that i love. or a band that kids like me love. music has a way of uniting people that has always stunned me. the minute this girl at work and i agreed on musical things we were instantly closer. it just seems soo fragile.  just go listen to lifted. if you dont have it i can burn it for you. there is no album better out now.  my head is in the clouds

      &nbsp; no one explained to me about love, as a kid i mean, i woke up went to school played with friends and knew what cartoons came on when.&nbsp; no one sat me down and explained that sometimes i would feel complete and other times i would feel like there was a black hole inside of me. no one sat me down and said in plain english " you will fall in love one day, and the rest of your life you will be crushed."&nbsp; i never thought to ask all those times when sex came up. what about love? a bunch of junior high boys with the yearbook opened wondering which girl might go out with them.&nbsp; have we reall come that far?   love is still an uncharted world that the most foolish of boys plunge themselves into. to explore like a cave and the farther you walk in the harder it is to remember the way you came in. till you forget what path you took to get there. and you are lost. but content. drowning but shrugging your shoulders. in a burning building that looks soo pretty you cant escape that moment.  love is like grabbing for a bar on the jungle gym with your eyes closed. hand over hand until your not sure where the next grip is. until you find yourself dangling on the edge of disaster. with one girl on your mind. with one thought on your mind.  &nbsp;hold tight.

      is it possible im losing my mind... perhaps parts of me are slipping away. i have waaaaaaayyyyyy tooo much&nbsp; on my plate sometimes.  &nbsp;  im trying not to panic about the fact that tonight i start a class about motorcycles and im terrified to fall off of one. i dont have any clue how to ride and im expected to be pro by the end of the week. is it just me or is that a lot of pressure. its been on my mind a lot so i dont know what to do about that. i guess i will just go to the class and see how it goes.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  i gotta buzz my head.

      did you ever have one of those days where everyones away message was just the worst possible things and you were sure they were all directed at you? one of those days where you stare blankly at anythings just trying to connect to it. one of those days where everystreet is full of cars but at the same time bare of all life. &nbsp; i picked up my pace as i walked past the neighborhoods where the black kids live, scared that they may wonder from thier houses at two in the morning to apply force to me and take my money. as i looked into the windows of&nbsp;these buildings that house the damned, that rise like fortresses over a street meant to instill wonder into those that walk down it, i couldnt help but feel sorry. sorry that everyone who lives there will be forced to hear "oh thats where you live" and "yeah, i know where that is. its right by the seven eleven right?" and there are night workers everywhere. men who sweep the streets, men who make small talk with customers, men who explain that they are trying to have a healthy breakfast at two am. men who walk aimlessly through parking lots sweeping scraps of paper into a bin. &nbsp; you may already be a winner &nbsp; and then its gone. added to more refuse and wrappers left by inconsiderate kids just like me. this is when the drunk come out to drive, the hours between midnight and work. because tomorrow is monday, and most will return to a job they hate because it pays the bills. and as they drive thier cars with the news playing over the radio they wonder why it just doesnt feel the same as it used to. they remember highschool and how adventurous they were. they remember summer and how that made them feel, but if you are put into some place for long enough just like a cold pool you get used to it. but these night men dont know what they have done, thier path has led them here. each descision is just an arrow leading to one more place you hate. but you keep on serving and you keep on smiling and you keep on sweeping because  &nbsp; you may already be a winner. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      just this evening i attended the 755 showing of king arthur. blair and i decided we would make it our mission to show up to the theater early in order to obtain good seats, since in the past we have had to sit next to some creeps and crane our necks. so i get a pretty good seat with my feet on the bars like i like a lot and we have a comfort zone of no one around us for at least 5ive seats. so we are sitting enjoying the impossibly easy pre movie trivia&nbsp;when this couple walks in. they start to climb the stairs but then they stop. the women explains how she likes to have her feet on the bar. so they sit down right next to me. now in the front row there were literally 7 or 8 other seats open, but they decided to sit RIGHT NEXT&nbsp;TO ME. am i the only one who hates that shit? seriously!!!! dont people want their space?? come on, you and your wife are at a movie you gotta be able to find a better place to sit. and the worst part is, i cant stand up and switch sides of my date because i dont want to seem rude. and even though that seemed like an option another woman comes along and sits two from blair. so that way if i switched from one side i would jsut be putting this other woman in the same situation i hate. it was lose lose but there were soo many open seats all around the theater. &nbsp; we need to start doing it peep show style, i would rather sit in a tiny box with cum splattered floors and enjoy my movie then have to rub elbows with some woman or man. i dont mind sitting that close to my friends or family and if the theater is crowded you just have to grin and bear that. but when there is a plethora of open fucking seats and you decide that right next to me is the best choice for you thats when i get upset.  &nbsp; there is only one solution as far as i can see it.  &nbsp; RENT MORE MOVIES

      i have never really been in an atmosphere like work before. its a lot like highschool though because everyone just kind of talks about everyone elses problems and business. and im all up to listen to it. My protoge got fired which pisses me off becuase the kid was awesome. he and i could bring in huge tips when we were working a fast night, its lame that he got canned but i guess he deserved it. supposedly he was disrespectful and stealing food. but thats what i taught him i guess. im only kidding, (who knows). and another gilr named rebecca got canned because she stole a bag full of cookies. good for her. work is to teach you how to get away with things, maybe you just need to ahve a ton of jobs until you get it right. There is a whole new crew at cookie dough and once the summer ends all the older kids will head off to college leaving me and a ton of young guns. this one girl flirts with our manager. and it is kind of odd. i mean work is stressful but flirting is just kind of weird in the office. because they are like using inuendo right over me and i just kept going "what!!!!" because it was like come over and help me bake cakes. meet me out back. it was just kind of creepy. the one manager lady who im afraid of (because she doesnt like me slacking) was really nice to me yesterday. but word on the street is she has been kind of a biatch lately so if that means that she changed sides and likes what im giving i dont mind. the one thing that is kind of lame is they had some huge getting to knwo each other meeting and shit and i wasnt even there. so its like they built a team without me. but im sure i will be able to fit in with the new people. &nbsp; i guess we have a homophobe, a bisexual, and two girls. sounds like the starter for an mtv show. when a bunch of stupid fuckers in an ice cream store stop being nice and start being real. &nbsp; call it the scoop or something. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      all i could see was the bright white tub as the bleach moved into my eyes. i could feel it in my lungs as it settled there. my eyes instantly locked shut and my throat shut. i just started caughing and i couldnt think. but then a hand grabbed mine and lead me to the sink. she started splashing and washing my face with water and making me take little sips of water to try and outlast the bleach that was killing me. i fumbled my way to the shower and stood with cool water rushing over my face. killing the burn. and she stood there watching. although my eyes werent open to see her there i could feel her. i took a deep breath and told her i loved her. just in case i didnt make it. for future reference. do not look face down with bleach, dont even bleach your hair. just dont do it.

      what is it? friday? probably, i dont really have much grip on days right now. i will be home on the fifth and there are a lot of you that i want to see when i get back. sorry to be away for soo long. trust me it wasnt my intention  there are a lot of things that i need to continue doing.   anyone interested i plan on taking down 100 flavor ice's in one day. so if you want to have one that isnt a part of my 100 with me that would be nice.  i paced in a figure eight as you talked over the telephone your voice fading in and out  my reception is terrible my perception is terrible it gets fuzzier with every minute i spend  acres away.  we let our bodies drift for two whole seasons winter and spring are not real to me just moments punctuated by the times i cried and the more overpowering times that i loved you  my fear is that that might become a constant like a refridgerator hum that you let become background noise static  electricity, is what i have blue eyes. not the color you would have chosen  the color of your car.  the color of my car.  ----------------------------------   there is a band called brundelfly that is very good.  ----------------------------------   ill see you all soon

      i cant stand hint droppers  it drives insane. the thing about it is if you really want something you just have to ask for it. take for example, at my job on of my bosses makes sure im always working. and since i have a lot of free time there she makes me do jobs that probably dont need to be done. but she never tells me to do the jobs then. she always says if i have the time to get around to it. but she knows that i have the time to do it. she is sure that i could do anything she asked me. it just confuses me because i dont mind doing these chores i just wish she would say its your job to polish this handle, its your job to get more water.  so i try to go and do wahtever as fast as possible. here is another example  blair and i were talking to this girl who was having her 18th birth day. but she didnt say "oh guess what its my birthday" she kept dropping hints,]  i wonder who to vote for in this upcoming election? should i go buy some lotto tickets im going to go buy somelotto tickets lotto tickets tickets lotto  and i jsut was like what is she talking about? because i dont always pick up on hints and all that jazz.  i can pick up on looks but never hints  and it all goes back to one day in ireland right next to st kevins cross when my whole life turned upside down.  surrounded by the bones of thousands that had been laying there for a thousand years or more.  my brother flipped a coin and told us  you dont get what you dont ask for.

      as i walked to my bed last night i was itching my sides. they were feeling extremely scratchy and i had  to take care of that.  so i remeber i coudlnt fall asleep and i was scratching extra hard. i woke up at three am and walked to the mirror.  i almost died.  my hips were breaking out in welts about as round as silver dollars in some places. like those fake pimples or something just way tooo big. i walked to my mom and asked her waht to do.  she told me to take my ammoccicillen. this was the anti biotic i had been on for the past week. so i went down stairs and got a huge glass of water. and popped one of my pills. it made me drowsy so i went back to bed. when i woke up my welts were a much different color. so at first i thought oh its clearing up.  as i walked to mirror it became clear that something was taking over my body. i just didnt know what yet. my dad and i climbed into the shadow and headed towads edwards.  they took my blood pressure and the thing broke and squeezedmy arm until it turned purple. which was a nice highlight to the insane rahses and bumps. they handed me some pills which i popped.  and then we drove home.

      around and i came to a point where i had to turn right. i had the green light but there were people in the cross walk. now im not one to be impacient but these people actually glared at me and walked slower because i was waiting for them. in fact to say they were walking would be an overstatement.  they strolled through the cross walk.  i was furious. now it is not my place to say how fast one should walk but i always thought it was common curtosy to feign a sort of jogging motion so that the driver knows you are trying to get out of their way sooner. perhaps a quick step or even a gallop. but to just walk along and glare at me. well needless to type i was upset about it.  i realized that if a cop drove 25 in a 50 almost all of us would drive 25 just in case.
