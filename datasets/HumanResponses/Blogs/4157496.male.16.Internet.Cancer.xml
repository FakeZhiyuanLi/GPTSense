I am really worried... which wouldn't u be if a Dog came and attacked your Girlfriend... well even if it happened to a friend wouldn't you be? I keep askin cos like... dog bites are bad, and have been known to be  lethal , and she assures me she is ok... I beleive her... but still I can't help worryin. Man... That Dog is dead, If I eva find it... lol...  colt 45 situation !!!  Anyways... erm... lil moment of life... was stuck with my relatives which is ok... but my Grandfather can be a real bastard sometimes... Y?!?!?! I am sooo annoyed with him cos he makes peeps round him upset. [ SITUATION:  People come round to visit... do you: A - Tell them to go clear out your dead wifes clothes and take them home repeatedly, B - Tell them about your Rambling, Gym and Golf Repeatedly, C - Make obsene comments about their life, D - Show them a good time. (Answer = D, Grandpa does A, B and C)].  Gargh... I hate my phone now... it isn't charging... completely ran out while I was tryna assess the situation of what happened to SJ and it like decides to die on me... now it isn't charging... and like my Uncles Died and my mums is O2... meh.

      Grr, I  love  these Lyrics!!!!  In a darkened place, Man without a face, Count on fingers the choices he could have made. Paint a picture of, view from up above, you - and soon hes painting in blood. And that man is me, La vida perdi, Now i'm casting a shadow in front of me, Now i've drained my heart so i no longer bleed.  Clip my wings and hope to fly, Wave my last goodbye.  Will i be awake, hold my hand when i die, wont you try Will you take my place, burn your name in the sky (x2)  Will you call to me, Just in memory, En la oscuridad te acordaras de mi. Now you turn to run uptowards the sun rise, you can't you're walking on glass. Now it's you or me Ya no creo en ti, Too late to say that you should've follwed me, Too late to burn my flesh so i longer feel.  Clip my wings and hope to fly, Wave my last goodbye.  Will i be awake, hold my hand when i die, wont you try Will you take my place, burn your name in the sky (x6)  Woo... I just love them... shame I couldn't write anything like this... although... I really like  SJ's Phantom  Lyrics... they are like A+.
