        This is NOT from McGregors. But I thought banner was a nice touch…   Hi all. I don’t know about you but these 36-hour lecture sessions are beginning to wear deep into my brain. Sunday after I left, I was standing in the parking lot at Broadacres, and at least a dozen people came and stood behind me and looked up to see what I was staring at.   Entrepreneur Assignment  I don’t know if I’m the only one who didn’t get the assignment brief. It apparently came amidst a stack of accounting lecture notes. If there are any of you who didn’t get all the relevant information, please let me know, so I can take it up with GIBS. I think distribution of course notes needs to be more reliable. Unless it’s just me with my head in the clouds.   OD  No one picked up on the obvious solution to Mandla’s debate around race, the oak tree and the fruit orchard relocation. What is required is to change the white oak at the top otherwise everything goes pear shaped. Are you nuts?   Theme Song  I seem to have managed to have touched Steve and Mandla in the recent performances. I’m not sure how badly that will affect my results for these two courses. The lyrics are attached. Knock yourselves out. The performance time of the theme song seems to have worked well at 1:45, so we’ll inculcate that into our cultural pear shaped oak tree. And to those of you who were disappointed you didn’t get an impromptu performance - apart from rapidly rehearsing the theme song two minutes before gong live, I never see my guitar. Believe me, it was for your own good. And I prefer not to throw my name away when I’m sober. One good thing has come out of all this - I’ve found a number of musicians hiding in the pine forests who wish to remain anonymous. So don’t worry Lisa &amp; Pieter – your secret’s safe. Pieter will be joining me on Electric Guitar next time, right, Piet.  Sam (now appointed my manager) had a suggestion to make a medley of all the songs we wrote on the first ‘getting to know you’ week. Please will each group send me the words and the tune your song was based on. I’ll work something out. Theme song suggestions, lines, phrases, tunes or even just a word or two can be dropped in my hand any time. Or emailed to me – it’s becoming a much more collaborative thing. I could do with a drummer and a keyboard player (not QWERTY, ok!)   Network News  This rag seems to at least be read by most of us, so I’m suggesting we make it a networking medium too. Share information about your company’s activities, strategic partnerships or resources you’re looking for and so forth. I’m sure I’m not the only one who wants to get my message across.   No news is still no news  There’s still no sizzling gossip, news of promotion, success stories or anything interesting about our colleagues to publish. Reporters or snitches required. Apply within.   And the coffee machine  Still on the trail of nailing the right person to make the arrangements with @ Gibs – been moved from Linda to Derek – let’s hope. You can always hope.  My boss is breathing down my neck, and he has halitosis, so enjoy singing in the car:   Oh where is the music…     This really enrertaining newsletter was created by Adam Rabinowitz Email:  urlLink adam@alexanderfrances.co.za  Website:  urlLink www.alexanderfrances.co.za
