      Debbie, Debbie, Debbie.  I must know at least six women named Debbie.  In my life, certain names seem to re-emerge again and again;  Robert, Kathy, Tracy to name a few.  But Debbie, though the name constantly recurs in my life with new introductions, was one of a kind.  "Kids meet your new step-mom," my dad announced when I walked in from a hard day in 8th grade.  I was shocked to see him home on a weekday before 7 p.m.  But shock was soon replaced by amazement when my baby blues beheld the long brown haired twenty something woman straddling his lap in one of our two kitchen chairs.  Her jeans were tight and I noticed she wasn't wearing a bra under her tank top.  That particular fact really irked me because I had to beg my dad into buying me a bra a few days before.  All the girls were wearing them at school.  The boys were running their hands up our backs to see if they could snap them.  I was humiliated when one of the most popular boys in 8th grade, Bryant Heflin, tried to pop my bra only to find I wasn't wearing one.  The only thing worse than having your bra snapped by a popular boy, was everyone laughing when he announced you didn't wear one.  I made up a story about how bras slow you down when you run.  I was on the track team that year and didn't want to be slowed down by a bra.  But after much badgering I talked my dad into taking me to Rinks.  The bras were beside the fabric cutting station.  The lady cutting fabric figured out our dilemma when dad bellowed..."Just pick one!" He was uncomfortable.  Neither of us had any idea what size I wore or even how to find out my size.  The fabric cutting lady took out her measuring tape and put it around my rib cage and figured out what I needed.  Dad never shopped for bras with me again.  While I was taking in the newlyweds I couldn't help but notice the fresh smell in the air.  The asbestos tile was white and actually shining.  Our tan pleather sofa, the only piece of furniture in the living room, was now its sole occupant.  The large black amplifiers, speakers, guitar cases, and keyboard were gone.  There was clean laundry nicely folded sitting on the sofa.  And I smelled something cooking.  I knew all the changes were her doing, and I was pleased.  I rushed to my room after a quick hello to see if the changes encompassed the entire trailer.  The double bed was made and there weren't any clothes or trash on the floor beside the bed.  I quickly fell to my knees and looked under the bed.  The true test.  "I counted over 16 bags," came the female voice behind me.  "You and your brother must really like Doritos," she said again.  My dad was towering behind her when I turned around.  "I've never seen such a mess," he said.  "You should be ashamed letting things get like this."  I knew he was only saying that for her benefit.  He never said anything about the trailer before.  In fact he joined us on the few occasions he didn't have a gig.  Slipping the empty Dorito bag under the bed to keep from making a trip into the kitchen, a whole three steps.  We ate shrimp and corn bread that night.  It was the first time I ever ate shrimp.  Debbie fried it on top of the stove.  The neighborhood cats sat at the kitchen door and meowed the entire time she was cooking.  Since we only had two kitchen chairs, she and dad ate on the brown pleather sofa.  Jay and I ate at the round table in the kitchen.  When Jay and I went to bed that night (on clean sheets) I thought, now this is going to be great.  I think I even offered up a little prayer for dad and his new wife.  I can't say when her tension and anger began exactly.  Just that it started shortly after the wedding vows.  Dad continued his factory job and commute during the week and played music on the weekends.  Debbie moved her things into the bathroom and my things out.  She made a big fuss when she found a jar of vinegar in the bathroom cupboard.  She wanted to know why it was in there.  I lied. Telling her I tried to clean the tub with it.  She looked skeptical because the tub had obviously never been cleaned.  Really, I was pouring that vinegar over Jay's head while he stood in the tub not a week before trying to get rid of his lice.  He was sent home from school with lice and one of my friends told me  vinegar killed it.  So I made him stand in the tub while I poured it into his hair.  He screamed and cried because it burned his eyes.  I told him to shut up and take it.  Dad came home and asked what was cooking because it sure smelled good.  When Jay would bring home notes from his teachers or his report card, I signed them.  When Jay had problems with bullies, and we were trailer court kids, we had lots of bullies...I defended him.  So when Jay came home with lice I (in all my 12 years of wisdom) got out the vinegar.  But I wasn't about to tell Debbie that.  Little things started appearing in the trailer.  A color tv, though used, was one of the best purchases.  We watched "Battle Star Galactica" on it the first night.  Dad's musical equipment wasn't gone, just relocated to his bedroom.  The amps were so big Debbie had dad put their mattress on top of them.  They called it their nest.  The double bed Jay and I shared was replaced with heavy wooden bunk beds.  I always believed my dad was poor.  Partly because every year before school when we were at Rinks buying clothes he'd tell me Jay and I were too expensive.  And because whenever I needed money for something at school, like having my last name put on my gym shirt, he'd get angry and say he didn't have the money.  But Debbie made my dad spend money on making our home life better.  She didn't think my dad was going to be famous but she knew exactly how much money he made and had no problem spending it.  It wasn't very long before we moved into a trailer across the street.  Jay and I got our own bedrooms (or closets as we called them).  Dad sawed the bunk beds apart.  With the bed in place there was exactly 14 inches of space to move around in each bedroom.  Shortly after the move to the bigger trailer, Debbie stopped going with dad to his gigs.  I don't know what happened in their relationship exactly but Debbie became bitter and angry all the time.  Since dad wasn't around much she chose to take it out on Jay and I with Jay getting the brunt of it.  No more shrimp and corn bread.  Her cooking degenerated to a piece of meat in the crock pot.  She sat in a newly acquired living room chair smoking cigarettes, drinking Pepsi, popping pink hearts (speed) and swinging her leg while wearing her tank top and no bra.  At first she started taking things away from us.  For Jay it was sweets, for me just starting high school it was anything social.  I was no longer allowed to play basketball, run track or go to any games or dances.  She sat in the trailer and expected us to do the same.  Jay would beg for Pepsi and she'd gleefully tell him no while sipping at the one beside her.  I began to hate her.  I tried to talk to my dad about her cruelty because it was increasing and was irrational.  He told me Jay and I were "heathens" who resented having someone put limits on us.  He said we finally have someone to take care of us and look how we complain.  I realized something very important.  My dad wasn't watching out for us.  Debbie was our jailer and seemed to be intoxicated with the idea of having authority over two other people.  Debbie also realized something very important.  My dad married her to be a babysitter.  She struggled with it, but ultimately accepted it.  She couldn't decide if she wanted to play cool step-mom or evil step-moster.  One day she'd keep me up all night on a school night moving furniture.  Give me a little pink heart for energy and send me off to school.  And the next day she'd be trying to bend me to her will by hitting me with a wire hanger on the back of the legs until they bled.  Her physical violence toward me happened twice.  The first time was with the wire hanger.  I stood completely still and when she was done I turned around to face her.  I was wearing shorts and I could feel the warm blood oozing down my legs.  I reached back and wiped at the blood with my hand, then wiped my face leaving a hot trail a blood splashed across it.  I told her if she ever touched me again I'd kill her.  The second time she hit me was the last time she saw me.  But that comes later.  Debbie was threatened by Linda living a few blocks away.  Linda moved on and was dating another man named Charlie.  Before Debbie became too harsh I was allowed to go out and play with a girl friend named Doty every day.  Except there was no Doty.  I was lying about a make believe friend so I could get out of our trailer and go see Linda.  I spent many hours with Linda, Charlie, Dondie, and Charlie's children.  I longed for dad to get back together with Linda.  She was working at the new Honda plant and making decent money.  She bought a new Firebird, a brand new big as I'd ever seen trailer, and Dondie had an Atari.  We left Marysville toward the end of my freshman year.  Debbie found a trailer court out in the country in another town.  So we moved to Plain City Ohio and I started at Jonathan Alder High School.  I didn't get to say good bye to Linda and I missed my friends in Marysville.  Debbie degenerated into a raving bitter lunatic in the country.  I never liked the way Debbie treated Jay.  Even when she was new and trying to make a good impression, she treated him like an after thought.  After defending him and looking after him for so long, I thought she was too mean to him.  I was a scrapper, I'd fight pretty much anytime anywhere (there is a certain amount of infamy in a fighter and any attention was better than none).  But I was afraid of Debbie for the most part.  So I watched her make Jay sit in his room with his bedroom windows closed in mid summer as punishment for some imagined crime.  I watched as she hit him with belts for using one of her writing pens.  I watched and did nothing but burn inside.    By the beginning of my 10th grade year I knew things had gone too far.  Debbie was not just screaming at us anymore, she was screaming at my dad.  So he wasn't home but a few hours total during the week.  Little things would set her off and Jay was throwing his arm up and cowering every time she raised her voice around him.  I made new friends at Jonathan Alder High School.  They were mostly throw away kids.  Kids whose parents were non-existent or abusive.  The kind of friends who never questioned why I wasn't allowed to go to dances, or ball games, or any school functions.  I was loyal to my friends.  The way I saw it, I didn't have anyone else.  I continued with my stories and was happy when I was away from Debbie and knew Jay was as well.  When we came home from school and walked in the door, Debbie would be waiting.  Sitting in her chair, Pepsi beside her, swinging her leg smoking a cigarette, wearing her tank and no bra.  She'd point to a laundry basket.  We had a washer but no dryer.  So Jay and I would lug the wet clothes to the laundry mat in front of the trailer court 3 blocks away.  I didn't mind the laundry mat.  It got us out of the house.  I'd let Jay go play out front while I did the clothes.  It was right next to the pool so sometimes we'd go out and sit there.  We'd carry the laundry back and go straight to our separate rooms.  They were bigger because the trailer my dad bought was brand new.  My room was a typical teenagers room with a poster of Michael Jackson's Thriller Album on my wall.  Jay's room was stripped of everything but a bed and chair.  No toys or books.  Jay had to sit in his chair until he was called for supper.  Then after supper back to his chair.  Everyday.  If he broke the rules in any way she beat him.  Jay and I took a paper route just to get out of the trailer.  I started getting involved in drinking before school with a girl down the street named Samantha Studebaker.  It was the only time I wasn't under Debbie's thumb.  I can't really say how much honest drinking we did.  We drank mixer for a long time thinking there was alcohol in it.  And instead of taking the bus to school a few guys we knew would swing by and pick us up.  The boys would drive fast and recklessly as Sam and I hung out the windows yelling, "Cool breeze," and "woo hoo."  Those stolen moments were exhilarating and I wanted more of them.  One day when I rode the bus I mouthed off to the bus driver.  She gave me detention.  The high school was a long way from our trailer court.  And when you had after school detention you missed the bus.  The year before dad bought Debbie a clunker beige four door pontiac.  It had rust around the bottom so he spray painted the bottom of the car black to help disguise it.  Debbie was just learning to drive and listened to Daryl Hall and John Oats on the 8 track.  Since I had detention for a week, I had to find a ride home.  I found a ride for every day except one.  I stood at the pay phone and called every person I knew with a vehicle but no one could come pick me up.  A thunderstorm broke loose just as I decided to walk home, even though it was a 45 minute drive.  I didn't have any choice.  When I walked out the front door of the school building, now long deserted except for the janitor, I saw the Pontiac sitting in front.  I didn't know Debbie was waiting for me, all the longer because I spent at least twenty minutes on the phone trying to find a ride.  I could tell by the way Jay was crouching in the back seat Debbie was in a rant.  I started to open the passenger's side door.  She jerked her arm up and pointed with her thumb to the back seat.  I got in beside Jay.  His eyes were red from crying.  Debbie peeled out and began screaming about how long she'd been waiting.  She was beating her fists against the steering wheel.  "I'm sick of this shit," she screamed pounding the steering wheel. "I waited for thirty minutes!"  I didn't say a word.  What was the point?  "You and your brother are worthless!" More screaming.  "Especially you!  You are done!  Do you hear me?  DONE!  You won't step a foot outside our trailer again until you are 18!"  My eyes narrowed.  Three years seemed a lifetime away.  "After the crap you pulled last week, now you do this!"  She was referring to an incident with Tracy DeWalt.  Tracy was a bad girl.  She was chubby, smoked pot, and was pretty tough.  She was one of the girls in my group.  Tracy spent the night with me one weekend.  I never was allowed to have friends over so I should have known something was wrong when Debbie suggested it.  Debbie took her back to the master bedroom.  They smoked pot together on the waterbed and then Debbie pumped Tracy for information.  Tracy told everything.  She told how much I hated Debbie.  How I couldn't wait to leave.  How I wished my dad would divorce her.  And most of all she told about my stories.  The stories I told in Home Economics class about slapping Debbie.  They were stories I wove.  They all centered on me smacking Debbie and telling her off.  A fantasy of mine, something I wanted to do since shortly after meeting her.  No one in the class, which consisted of my group of friends, believed it.  Our teacher, Ms. Bell, just ignored it and everyone seemed to have a story or fantasy of their own.  I remember Ms. Bell teaching us about sewing, cooking, and how to go on a job interview.  She was all of twenty-three, twenty-five at most.  I remember thinking she was incredibly naive and optimistic for one so old.  When Tracy in a stoned stupor told Debbie everything, it was the beginning of the end.  Debbie forced my dad to get off work early and come to the school.  The office pulled me out of class and said the guidance counselor wanted to see me.  It was an ambush.  I walked in and there was my dad sitting in his red jacket just like Burt Reynold's jacket in "Smokey and the Bandit." His said Honda on the sleeve.  Debbie was sitting beside him looking like the cat who ate the canary.  She was actually wearing a bra.  I knew then things were bad.  She spent the next hour saying things like, "You're gonna tell this man and that class you never touched me.  Admit it, admit you never slapped me."  I didn't say a word but just stared at her.  I wasn't admitting anything.  When my dad saw the mutiny look in my eyes he used his this-is-your-last-chance-before-I-spank-you-voice, "Admit it!"  I looked at the guidance counselor who was looking ill.  He was the voice on the intercom cracking jokes every morning.  He was always quick with a smile and hug.  He was in over his head.  I knew it and he knew I knew it.  He excused himself after a few moments and returned with Ms. Bell.  Ms. Bell was scared.  I could see the fear on her face.  She was worried about losing her job.  She let us talk in class and now that talking had come back to haunt her.  I wanted to comfort her but humiliation choked off the words.  Only sarcasm remained.  "Can you believe they came all this way because she is worried a bunch of teenagers might think I beat her up?"  I asked in a tone that would have gotten my face slapped at home.  Ms. Bell said, "It doesn't matter.  No one really listened or believed it.  I didn't believe it."  Debbie snorted.  She saw the immaculately dressed Ms. Bell and despised her.  Debbie believed in being tuff.  She talked about whipping this woman or that woman, how she rode with the hell's angels and learned to fight there.    Her stories made me afraid.  Afraid to defend Jay.  Afraid to stand up against her alone.  But I could feel inside my gut that one day we'd have a blow out.  She must have sensed it too because she always said, "When you feel froggy...leap."  The day I wiped blood on my face and told her never to touch me again was a beginning of sorts for me.  The second time I stood up to her was in the guidance counselor's office.  So after detention a few weeks later, in that two toned Pontiac, on the way back to the trailer court in the pouring rain, I listened to her rant, threaten, and pound the steering wheel with her fist.  Some little voice inside me said, "It's time."  By the time we got back to the trailer the storm was in full force.  I was wearing Sam's Lee pin stripped baggy pants.  Dad and Debbie weren't shopping at Rinks anymore, but I still wasn't allowed to go pick out my own clothes.  Debbie did it.  And sometimes she picked to humiliate.  So I borrowed a lot from Sam.  I walked back to my room and Jay to his.  I was leaving.  I picked up the pictures of my friends and put them in my coat pocket along with me Billy Squire cassette tape.  I went to Jay's door right next to mine and looked at him sitting in his chair.  "Get your coat on," I said.  "We're leaving."  Debbie heard us talking and came stomping down the hall with cigarette in hand.  "What are you doing?" She demanded.  "Leaving," I said.  "I'm taking Jay and going to find my mom.  She has got to better than you."  "You're not going anywhere," she said.  "Get back in your room."  "No," I said.  She held her cigarette out to Jay.  "Hold this Jay," she said.  I looked at Jay.  "Don't hold it Jay.  You don't have to do what she says anymore.  Today's liberation day."  She flicked the cigarette in my face and came toward me.  I swung and hit her full force in the face knocking her glasses off.  We scuffled.  She pulled my hair and scratched my face but I just kept punching her face.  All the years of taking her abuse, watching her abuse my brother, my dad.  It all came out.  I raged.  I beat her ass.  She ran into Jay's room.  He ran from her and huddled on his bed.  She screamed, "You can go.  You can go.  But Jay stays here!"  "Jay goes with me!" I screamed and knocked her to the floor.  Jay got his coat and we left her there, on the floor in his room.  I threw open the screen door on the trailer.  The wind caught it and broke the chain.  It slammed against the side of the trailer as the wind and rain hit me full in the face.  The paper truck was just dropping off our newspapers for delivery when we walked out.  We walked right past the pile of papers and headed for the highway.  Common sense hit me two blocks later.  We were at the edge of the trailer court closest to the highway.  I had no idea where my mom lived.  I didn't even know if she still lived in the state.  I knew we would be reported as run aways.  But I didn't think that was right.  We didn't run away.  We were forced out.  I saw Drachel's trailer.  Drachel and her sister Stephanie were upper crust in our trailer court.  Their parents were still married and they dressed well.  They took piano lessons and their mom was classy because she spoke respectfully to everyone.  I went to the door and asked her if I could use the phone.  She didn't want to let me in at first, soaking wet.  But I was persistent until her dad came to the door.  He told us to come in.  Crying and laughing alternately I told them what happened.  Crying for leaving my dad, and laughing to finally be free.  They didn't know what to do so I suggested they call Children's Services.  I gave them a number I had hidden in the protective cover of my wallet.  A couple months before liberation day, I skipped school for the first time ever.  A good friend of mine moved to Columbus.  She called our group and said she was feeling blue, suicidal.  We all skipped to go see her.  I made the arrangements and told the lie to get a woman who befriended me to drive us there and pick us up later that day.  I didn't know the school called when you were absent.  Debbie took the call and immediately called the police.  She wanted me arrested for being truant.    They were all waiting for me when I came home.  I saw my dad's car out front and knew I was busted before I ever stepped inside the trailer.  The police talked to her and then to me.  They'd spent a good hour or more with her before I arrived.  They pulled me outside at one point so she couldn't hear.  One of the cops handed me the number to a social worker.  He said, "I can see things aren't right here.  Your step-mom is a little high strung.  If you ever need anything or things get crazy here call this number."  That one officer gave me something my dad denied me.  Validation.  After only a few short minutes in her presence he knew she was twisted.  Despite skipping school he was on my side.  I took the number and hid it.  That is the number I pulled out and gave to Drachel's dad.  He called it reluctantly, not wanting to get involved.  The police and social services arrived an hour later.   The police took pictures of my face.  Debbie scratched it and tore my clothes.  Some of my hair was missing.  Then the social worker, an obese man in a suit, took me and Jay to a half way house in another town.  It was a house like any house you might see in the country.  Except it was new and had industrial size windows.  We sat down at the kitchen table.  I looked around at the big house at my reflection in the dark glass windows.  I saw a boy about my age peeking around a corner at me.  He didn't come out and was cautious not to be caught.  Jay was twelve but scared.  He sat close beside me.  I didn't know what was going to happen to us.  I did know that it was a beginning.  We were free.    A short round man with red hair and beard came and talked to us briefly.  He took Jay to the boys wing where a few other boys, all teenagers, were sleeping.  I was taken to the girls wing.  There were no other girls there.  The industrial bathrooms were large and clean.  I didn't have a toothbrush or anything else.  Just the pictures of my friends and Billy Squire.  I went to bed and the next morning awakened to sunlight streaming across the bed.  It was quiet.  No one was yelling and it felt good.  I got up and went to look for Jay.  In the large kitchen I discovered you had to earn your food.  They explained a point system to me, but I didn't listen.  This was just a pit stop and I wanted to see Jay.  They showed me around and finally brought Jay out.  I met three other boys.  The one who was peeking at me from around the corner the night before.  And two older boys.  The social worker came to take us back to his office.  My dad was meeting us there.  He was alone when he arrived.  The social worker asked, "Where is Debbie?"  "She's tired.  She was up all night after the kids ran away worrying."  Dad said.  I rolled my eyes.  I knew she called the police as soon as we left the trailer.  But to hear my dad take her side before he even talked to us was typical.  "We're all tired," the social worker said.  "But that isn't a very good reason to miss something this important.  I am deciding today if you will get your children back."  "I'm not going back," I said.  "I didn't leave to go back."  "Can you keep your wife and daughter from fighting?"  The social worker asked dad.  "When I am home," dad said.  "And just how much is that?"  Dad adjusted his seat and smiled in the way adults do when they are uncomfortable but about to tell you something you should already know.  "Not much."  "If you send me back," I said.  "I will leave again.  But this time on my own.  I won't come for help."  "Shut up," my dad growled.  "Haven't you done enough?  Debbie told me all about what happened."  "I bet she did dad," I said.  "I tried to talk to you about her but you never wanted to hear it."  "What's to hear?"  He spat.  "You want your own way and when an adult tells you no, you don't like it."  "I don't like it when its always no dad," I said.  "Debbie is crazy.  You don't want to admit it because it's easier to just let her kill us."  "There is the issue of Debbie striking your daughter," the social worker cut in.  "She left scratches on her face."  "That is from restraining her!" Dad said.  "Do you think my daughter would be able to walk out if my wife was fighting her?  She'd be hurt a lot worse if Debbie was fighting."  I knew my dad was choosing the easy way when he didn't respond to my pleas about Debbie.  Somehow that was easier to stomach than the alternative.  But I finally had to face the truth in that stuffy little social worker's office.  My dad was choosing Debbie, not just the easy way, over me and my brother.  Choosing her and clinging to her like a dying man in need of water.  I wasn't about to sacrifice my life for his illusions.  "Mr. Thomas," the social worker said.  "Debbie is an adult and should know better than to fight with a minor.  She chose to fight.  That's called child abuse, even if the child fights back or initiates.  The adult can always walk away.  The adult is supposed to use better judgment."  Dad shook his head.  Not even the social worker would convince him Debbie was wrong.  At the end of the meeting the social worker determined dad couldn't protect me so the state of Ohio took custody.  When Jay was asked what he wanted to do dad insisted he go back home.  I looked at Jay and he nodded.  I couldn't believe it.  I wondered if something happened at the half way house to make Jay want to go back to Debbie instead of spending another night there.  The social worker warned me that the twelve girls in the group home I'd live in were a "rough" lot.  What he didn't know about me was that I could fight, and was pretty good at it.  I doubted they were any rougher than the crowd I belonged to at school.  I was willing to risk it.  Since Jay was going back to dad's house I could always leave if I didn't like it.  But I kept that to myself.  At the end of the meeting a court date was discussed.  Jay went and stood by dad.  I hugged Jay good bye and shook my dad's hand.  That was the end of his parental role in my life.  A week later I got to get up in open court and tell about everything Debbie ever did to me and Jay.  She sat there scowling at me with my diary open in front of her.  She believed the judge would give her a chance to speak, to humiliate me by reading my diary in front of the court.  She miscalculated.  The judge never allowed her to speak.  I spoke on record and then Drachel's dad got up and gave his testimony.  He was scared and uncomfortable because he didn't want to be involved.  They moved from the trailer court shortly after the trial.  The most satisfaction I received was when the social worker got up and testified that Debbie was irrational and immature.  He said she wasn't suitable to raise children and the court needed to direct her to parenting classes.  I wanted to jump for joy when the judge looked at her and said in his harshest voice,"Mam you are lucky this isn't a criminal proceeding or you'd be on your way to jail right now."  She actually started to speak.  He held up his hand and yelled, "Don't say a word.  I don't want to hear anything you have to say.  Hitting a child and leaving this, he held up a picture of me taken from that night (and I looked really bad because it was raining and my hair was wet and clothes in disarray) is a criminal act.  I don't care what you think this child did.  She didn't make you raise a hand to her.  You could have let her go and then this would have been a situation for the youth authorities.  But your bad judgment proves you are not fit to raise children."  I smiled inside and finally after three years felt the light in my soul start to shine again.  The judge continued.  "The only reason I am not taking the boy out of the home is because he wants to stay and I believe this incident will make the father more attentive.  However, the social worker assigned to this case will be making unannounced visits to check on Jay for at least the next year.  I will review the case and report in twelve months to determine if further action is necessary."  It was over.  I was free.  Jay wasn't with me, but the social worker was going to make sure he wasn't abused anymore.  I won.  The judge ordered my dad to pack my things and have them ready for pick up the next day.  My clothes were in black garbage bags, shredded, the next day when my social worker took me to pick them up.  She destroyed everything else, including all the short stories and poems I'd written over the years.  The social worker drove me out to Sedalia, or Midway Ohio depending on when you lived there before of after the name change.  Sunrise house, a group home for girls.  The girls who would become my world for the next year....but that is another story.

      It is what it is.  A fabulous saying.  I don't know who coined the phrase but it has the potential to be THE sum phrase of my life.  Being on the road to fame and striving to achieve fame are two different things.  I never strived to achieve fame.  Not strive in the way you hear others strive.  Plugging away at a craft for years, going hungry, forsaking all other pursuits.  In my mind, I was simply on the road to "making it."  So my entire existence was staged (as much as I could control it) so that when I was being interviewed on the Morning Show after I made it, I could give little fascinating stories of myself.  My mom and dad divorced when I was around 7 years old.  My dad left and eventually my mom degenerated into homelessness.  Eventually, by 3rd grade my brother and sister and I ended up with my dad.  This was quite a feat in the 70's.    We moved into lot 235 of Marysville Trailer Court with my dad and his girl friend Linda and her son, Dondie.  Linda was a factory worker with long blonde hair and thick black eye liner with blue eye shadow.  Her bangs were long and she tucked them behind one ear.  She had a slight over bite and I was proud that I looked more like her than my own mom.  Linda believed my dad was going to be famous too.  We all did.  Despite the addition of three children, the glamour of dating a guy in the band kept their relationship steady...at least for awhile.  So Saturday morning doughnuts started there.  And so too the dream of becoming famous myself.  I would sit on the red carpet in the "equipment room" of Linda's trailer, so called because it didn't have any heat and dad's music equipment was stored there.  I'd rub my toes on the carpet to keep my feet warm and frantically write.  I was writing a script for my favorite show, "The Dukes of Hazard."    I worked on that script so long and so often that my dad gave me a brown accordian envelope to keep it in.  I named my first script, "The baby doll caper."  I'd invite my friends over just to read it.  They never seemed as enthusiastic about it as I thought they should.  I was passionate about it.  I loved writing.  I was sure I found my niche.  Writing would make me famous.  I started practicing what I'd say when interviewed about my writing.  How I'd pull out my first script and awe everyone.  How John Schneider (Beau)would fight Tom Wopat(Luke) for the right to call me girl-friend.  Then Life happened....  My older (by 3 years) sister Wanda started having problems with Linda.  She didn't like her.  Not because Linda was evil or mean really but because she wasn't our mom.  So after many run-away attempts, sneaking out, boys and drinking the judge told my dad to choose between Wanda and Linda.  He rented a trailer a couple blocks away.  A small two bed room with asbestos tile floors and one bathroom.  Brown paneling covered the length and width of the trailer and an odd smell often erupted from the furnace when it kicked on sputtering and winding up and down.  Dad still saw Linda, but it was different.  Wanda eventually ran off and the court put her in juvenile detention.  Then she went to live with our Nane and I never saw her again, even to this day.  But that is another story.  After Wanda left, we spent most of our time at Linda's trailer again so dad didn't buy a color tv for ours, just a small black and white.  At one point, he put a pad lock on the front door because the trailer became more of a storage unit for his music equipment than a home for us.  It was always exciting to return for some small reason to our little trailer because the mail box was always brimming full.  I loved getting mail and pretending junk mail was fan mail, and the more junk the better my day went.  When dad and Linda broke up for the final time, we moved all our clothes to the little trailer.  The script was lost and I never saw it again.  I was given a key to wear around my neck for the pad lock on the front door and an alarm clock.  I was eleven.  It was my responsibility to wake up my dad and brother in the morning.  At 6:30 am my alarm clock would start piping out the most popular music of the day.  I'd jump out of bed, feet slapping the cold asbestos tiles to the opposite end of the trailer and knock on my dad's sliding panel bedroom door.  "Dad."  No answer.  "Dad!"  "What?" a muffled reply.  "Time to get up."  I'd say.  "Ok."  And we'd repeat this sequence for the next half hour or more every day all the way through 6th, 7th and most of 8th grade.  I'd go get ready for school and get my brother up and dressed.  Though my dad purchased my clothes at Rinks without having me try them on. I did the laundry at the laundry mat.  So, I often wore mismatched or brilliant colored clothes.  If I wore green pants and a yellow shirt with brown shoes, I'd tell everyone I was being a flower that day.  If I wore a psychedelic skirt and shirt I'd tell everyone I was being a 60's rock star.  But I dreamed of the day I could wear Levis and Nike tennis shoes just like the other kids.  The day when I was famous.  When we slid our panel door open in the morning dad was gone.  There was usually a dollar for us on the round table we used in the kitchen.  The one that couldn't take any weight without tipping over.  We stopped at the Short Stop in front of the trailer court and bought four candy bars.  My favorite was Whatchamacallit..before they put the nasty caramel in it.  And Zero candy bars.  A breakfast of champions.  We liked the Short Stop.  It is where we bought our doughnuts for Saturday morning.  And the Doritos for Friday night while watching the Dukes of Hazard on the black and white.  It was also nice on our birthdays because the owner would give us a free scoop of ice cream.  As long as your name was in the black birthday book hanging from a string on the ice cream case.  We made sure we put our names in there every new year.  The Short Stop was also important because out front stood a telephone booth.  The telephone booth was our only access to a telephone.  It was also the only place I could perform regularly.  I'd practice talking to my agent, or being interviewed via phone, you know for when I was famous.  People would pull into the Short Stop parking lot and see me standing there talking seriously, or laughing, or crying, or being curt with the non-existent person on the other end.  And someone waiting to use the phone always motivated me to higher levels of performance.  They just had to know by the way I talked and gestured that I was going to be famous tomorrow so they better pay close attention today.  I was taping The Dukes on Friday night with my cassette recorder.  I was the babysitter, and truth be told the parent to my brother, when my dad played music or worked.  I chose the shows we watched.  I would spend the rest of the week listening to the tape over and over, memorizing the lines.  Except of course when we watched "Dr.Who."  I auditioned for a play at the high school when I was in 8th grade.  My dad didn't know I was going to do it.  I heard about it and walked to the high school to try it out.  They asked me to come back.  So the next day I walked all the way back to the high school and auditioned again.  I got the part of narrator.  I was so excited and terrified.  There was a time commitment I knew deep in my heart I couldn't keep because of babysitting Jay.  I didn't know if I would make one rehearsal, let alone come every night for two weeks.  Acting seemed the most natural course because I was doing it all the time in real life anyway.  I didn't mean to lie to people.  I saw myself as a master story teller and enjoyed weaving the story so much that I often forgot where reality stopped and storytelling began.  Famous people lead exciting lives and I was determined to make my life sound exciting, even if it mean flat out lying.  For the high school play, I started memorizing lines.  My dad wasn't too happy one way or another because he was busy with his life.  But I knew I had something special inside me and if I could only find a way to show the world, then they'd all see I was special. Then Life happened....  I never made even the first rehearsal.  I never performed in that play.  A new woman was on the scene.  Dad brought her home and introduced us to Debbie, his new wife.  If I could foresee how Debbie would change my life, I'd have run for the hills.  She deserves her own post.  And this is what it is.

        I always wanted to be famous.  I used to awaken every Saturday morning to the thum thum thum of a bass guitar.  It vibrated me awake and as the volume built, forced me from the warmth of my blankets.  Yawning, blond hair askew, I'd meander into the kitchen for chocolate donuts while tapping my toes in time to the thum thum thum of my dad's bass.  He wouldn't speak, too involved in his practice.  But he'd nod, and I'd nod, then take the donuts back to my bedroom to watch cartoons.  My mom wasn't in the picture.  I had a little brother.  My dad worked hard 5 days a weeks at a factory an hours commute from our trailer.  It was a good job for a man who left the rigors of a coal mining family when he was still in middle school.  He quit 8th grade and moved North, out of Southern Kentucky to Columbus Ohio.  Lots of things happened in between him quitting school and ending up raising two kids on his own.  But this isn't his story, it's mine.  He worked hard all week and then played music all weekend.  He played bass, key board and vocals.  Sometimes he was the lead singer and sometimes he wasn't.  Sometimes the bands were rock.  Sometimes country.  Sometimes even Elvis impersonations.  But they played in bars every Friday and Saturday night which meant my brother and I spent more time alone than most kids.  So every Saturday morning, after driving home from his Friday night gig, my dad would practice.  Some people might pour themselves a night cap to relax.  My dad played his guitar.  And because I was ten and everything seemed to center on my dad, I never doubted he would "make it."  Sure I heard him say occasionally that being strapped with three kids was holding him back.  (Yes I said three...I have an older sister but she didn't stay with us long.  And that is her story not mine.)  So as I ate chocolate covered donuts from the bag and watched little blue smurfs on tv (at least everyone told me they were blue, we only had a small black and white) I'd listen to my dad practice.  I guess it was those Saturday morning sessions that imprinted on my mind.  It must have been then I decided to be famous too, just like my dad.  The fact I didn't have any particular talent or skill didn't deter me.  I just KNEW I was gonna "make it."  Twenty-five years later, my dad hasn't made it.  At least not in the way I always imagined he would.  And me, well I am just discovering something my dad must have learned as well.  I'm not famous.  I will never be famous.  I may play my guitar and sing my heart out, but I'm really NOT that good.  And so that makes me what?  Average that's what.  It seems to me that people spend most of their lives trying to "be different."  We want to be special in some way.....and the older we get the way we're special doesn't seem to be as important as getting to be special.  Call me a slow learner.  That it took 35 years for me to figure out, LIFE IS NOT ABOUT ME.  And yet there are these experiences that are significant to me.  It seems a waste to just let them stay dormant inside me, to die with me.  So this "blog" is my way of writing some of these experiences down.  I understand no one will ever read them, not really.  But there is something in the writing.  It seems less wasted, less un-famous.  And so Life And begins.....
