      This World is insane. Doesn't know much about anything. Whatever it knows, its satisfied with that. But what is this world all about? Nothing more than the people living in it who take the centrestage.

      As a child I dreamed a lot, Even now I do that because, It's all that I found, From childhood, till now. To dream a lot, to live in that, To get something, if not around.  Met my guru, one time, When I slept, late night, It was a time, in fact, I had no idea, of anything about, I gaped at him, talked a lot, Told me something, and concluded that dream.  And another night it was a girl in sight, I admired her beauty a lot, Simple yet what I thought she was, Had a ride on the clouds above, I even asked h er hand, everyone would wish for one, The time was to kiss her, but the dream remained pending forever.  There are so many things around, You can get them happen once and for all, Just dream and drown in that, Don't think much but dream in a thought, Oh! What did I write everything about, Sorry it is not a dream but you can also try to write,  The story of a dream come true, Which can drown you too.

      The smell of the earth The silence of the birds The hiding of the men The resting of the leaves The joy of the heart The greatness of the past The shining of the clouds The pouring of the drops The waiting of the stop The playing of the kids The loving of the pairs The noise of the creeks The thoughts of the mind The beauty of the unexplained  The mystery of the feeling The talking of the unknowing The peepingo f the frogs The creeping of the worms The sprouting of the seeds The doubting of the deeds The request of the distressed The expect of the unexpected The tragic of the magic The feeling is so fantastic This happens everytime it rains You get to see everything happening The joy of the heart,  The mind intact, The clouds give rain, The Earth collects in vain.

      I am a Soldier in the battle filed and I have dreams to fulfil. I have always learned to serve my country with my heart and my will and with a great zeal. I am honoured to have been bestowed with the great powers of the infinite and my country. I have this great responsibility to lead my men with honour and dignity.  This is the only chance I am left with to prove my love for my country. And I will die happily with my head held high and the enemy bent at its knees.  I bow to thee for bringing me to the dream that I have always dreamed to see. I have my last blood served until my last breath and the last sight I can see. I live to be the solider in the battle field who dreamed to be. I have my heart and my love ready to dream and to make it see.

      I heard a deep cry inside, it sounds like a suicide, Which made rounds, through the taverns of a desert, Through the silent mountains, the foggy glaciers, and the stormy slides. It's a shrill cry, chilling through the bones, chiselling all the way, From an unknown compartment to the centre point of the mind, No water can control the fire that has raged inside the heart,  It's soon to engulf like a wild storm cleaning everything on its path, The pain is killing like a sharp knife and chilli peppers in the eyes, When suffering is inevitable then why do I have to cry? But I can't hold on to this thin red line like this forever, It will break away very soon drowning everyone attached to it like a river, Oh! my good old senses where are you hiding at these times, Help me to get out of this situation and through these silent cries, No friend is in sight nor anyone is seen through the invisible light, Darkness has clouded the skies dangerously to take everyone for a ride, I am crying aloud through the silent and the sensitive mind, No solution appears in the vicinity of the endless skies and the open minds, Hopes are aloof, strengths and weaknesses taking a joyride side by side. What should I do when dead men walk through the only nights! They call me like the silent valleys and heavy dreams, to leave my life, I lost hopes on life, now I can't do anything, anytime. Suicide is suing me to side it when the time has eventually come, What a situation in which I am when I should have avoided this thing long time,  Hey look at the morning skies, the sun is full, the sky is blue, the birds flying high, People are laughing loud, the gurus are resting in peace, I found something I think, It was a dreaded night, with a suing suicide provoking me to take its side, For the moment I forgot the last flight, the terrible side of a far sight, But now I am living for those, everyone to see the light.

      HI Friends! This is just a beginning of a revolution yet to gain momentum. This will have attained its word only when it reaches most of the masses, people out there who are yet to see the light of the day, who may believe a computer to be a god becuse it does most of the things. Its not a surprise to find such a kind of tribe existing out there because still they are living in darkness either deprived or are unable to access what we all get to. This is a first step towards a revolution. I am a part of it. Let us get into the jungle and start our journey rather than sitting on a mountain and look at the jungle from behind. Roar like a lion, jump like a monkey, creep like a snake, hop like a kangaroo, fly like an eagle, swim like a dolphin, walk like an elephant, hide like a chamaleon, fight like an hound, sleep like a bear, ....   Welcome to the Online Jungle.   Thanks Google for providing us, citizens of the world with all the necessary basic supply. I'm coming!  A. T. Raghu Nandan
