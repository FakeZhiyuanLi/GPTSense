      I have been thinking a lot about my twin interests in psychology and energy work-- and it kind of ties into these Caroline Myss tapes I have (I dont remember the title), and she talks about how in order for energy work to have a lasting effect, you have to be FULLY in the PRESENT moment-- if you are too caught up in the past or future, it will not stick, you will keep getting sick, you'll waste all of your money on acupuncture and Reiki and get nowhere fast. You have to be living fully in the now in order to be there to experience the healing. So for me, it feels like working with people's thinking caps is a way of helping them GET to that point,  GET to the present moment, stop lingering over old wounds or projecting about future dreams. Just.Get.Here.Now.    I think the mind has such HUGE power over the energy system- and thus the physical body- and the mind itself really needs to be healed in its own right, or else its going to keep afflicting the body and getting in the way of your energy work by just rethinking the same old thoughts, sparking the same destructive emotions, which will just keep remanifesting the same wounds over and over again. What's so exciting, though, is that just as profound of an influence it can have in the negative, so can you learn how to use it  positively as a tool to create a healthier energy system, to create a healthier physical system, to live a healthier life. We need to  start learning how to use our minds as tools, and take as seriously (if not more...) the necessity of staying mentally 'fit' as aerobically so .   Lucky for us, we can become aware of what the mind does, and teach it new strategies when the old ones aren't working.  What a Gift that one of the hugest influences on our health is something we are completely in control of, whether we always feel it or not !

      It's rare that you find bits of wisdom from college textbook writers, but this one got me thinking: "I have always suspected that what people choose to study is a result of something other than mere accident. It seems to me that  people study what they feel they most need to understand, and frequently, these are things that frighten them ."  -Lisa J. McIntyre, from The Practical Skeptic (a sociology textbook)  I am currently studying psychology and sociology. And I am damn scared of people. So this is a very appropriate sentiment. It's kind of ridiculous. I am planning a career as a therapist and half of the time I just want to run and hide from people. What am I doing to myself!? Do I really want to get into this field? Could I really possibly be successful in it when I'm such an introvert, and so often just want to get away from people? Sometimes the answer is a resounding 'get out while you still can!'... but most of the time, it's something else. It's a knowing that there is room for me in the field, there is room for me to be the best kind of therapist that  I  can be, there is room for my own idiosyncracies and anxieties, in fact, there's a need for them. Otherwise, I wouldn't be receiving such a strong call to enter the field. I have to trust at least that much.  Sure, social situations can be scary for me. But do I want to spend the rest of my life hiding from what scares me? Or do I want to face them head on, study my fears, and work through them?  I think any chosen career needs to be a dialogue. It needs to be a conversation between what I have to offer the world and what the world has to offer me  (Where your talents and the needs of the world intersect, there you will find your calling" -or something like that, I forget). I have to be able to serve and to be served. The quickest way to a dissatisfying career is getting one that doesn't offer the chance to grow and learn.  I think a career should be just slightly confrontational , just slightly out of the comfort zone. The same could be said of romantic relationships; there needs to be the potential to support and help each other grow and mature as human beings, there needs to be some 'purpose' other than the usual dribble.  Resting stagnant in security is no way to live - a relationship (or career, or perhaps anything) shouldn't be a blankie- it needs to be challenging (in the sense of cajoling me into being my most self-actualized self), exciting, inspiring,  as well as  safe, restful and compassionate.   I just started to write something about 'relationships are some of the most satisfying things in my life'... and I had to stop myself. Is that true? Is that my voice talking, or the voice of my family or my culture? Do I believe that, or do I think I should believe that? My world doesn't seem to accept/value the desire to be alone, doesn't embrace the introvert. I have always enjoyed being alone. I have also enjoyed relationships. I can't say, though, that one is more satisfying than the other, and that almost feels like blasphemy in such an extraverted world. In fact, if I had to pinpoint it, I would say that  the experience of being able to fully express who I am is the most satisfying experience  in my life. Whether that happens around others or not depends. There is something amazing about being able to be so authentic, and being with someone being his/her authentic self, and to feel that connection and openness. But when I am alone and feeling that deep easy self-expression, I feel a similar connection to myself, or even to Spirit. It doesn't seem to matter. What matters is being able to feel unrestricted, uncensored, wholely myself- which is ultimately my responsibility, my task to figure out how to cultivate that feeling in all situations.   Perhaps that is also why sometimes I am so attracted to large raucous parties/concerts-- there's a certain anonymity that is refreshing, and a certain 'anything goes' kind of attitude. People do some pretty reckless, embarrassing stuff and it usually just slides on by, is part of the scenery. I like that kind of freedom, and in that atmosphere feel accepted no matter what behavior I exhibit.  One driving motivation in my life is communication. Either on an interpersonal level, hearing and being heard, or as an individual trying to express myself via writing and artmaking. And the drive to be a therapist is in large part driven by my belief that there is nothing more valuable on this earth than to  1. Learn myself inside and out, 2. LIVE from that knowing and 3. Be able to express at least a smidge of it to the important people in my l ife, myself included.  Another driving motivation (and fear) is the experience of union... but I think I will save that thread for when I write on becoming invisible, which is another post soon to come.  I don't know if I really got to the point here, if I really tackled what that quote makes me think about or feel. Alas, can't always hit the target. Perhaps another day. Maybe it's just because it's a pretty simple concept, doesn't need a long exposition or anything. Too late for that I guess.

      It seems like people cut their hair to signify something. Most of the time when I ask people who have just cut their hair  why  they did it, and I probe a little further than "I was just ready for a change", I find a really intimate story. It is often about a breakups; people, girls especially, seem to cut their hair after breakups. There is also something about starting a new chapter in life- which I guess is basically what happens during a breakup- but like for a new career, a move, etc. Transition seems to inspire haircuts, especially for women, although I haven't spoken w/many men on the topic. People also seem to cut their hair when they are seeking to bring transition on,  as if the act of cutting hair alone will create the change one longs for .   I think this is an interesting thread, and I'd like to do some research. What are some myths involving haircutting? Where does this desire come from? I seem to remember hearing something, maybe in some anthropology class, about women growing their hair out when they become mothers. I'm not sure if there are any cultures where women  cut  their hair to signify anything- ie, according to what I've seen, women seem to get dramatic haircuts to signify they're single again- or out of a relationship- or unattached- or just transformed somehow- or something. I know monks and nuns in the Buddhist tradition cut their hair when they take on robes. Maybe there's some evolutionary reason. Or maybe it's truly as simple as just wanting a 'change'. But that statement itself has some pretty vast implications- like, are you looking for Change in the big sense, like you're tired of life, or are you seriously just wanting to change your haircut.

      I had a wonderful appointment w/my therapist this week. I can't explain why, exactly-- it was a fairly typical conversation, no major insights. I just left feeling really *open*, like I am in charge of my own destiny, like I have control of my fate, and  I can choose the life I want to live , can choose who I want to live it with, and  I am capable enough to make my choices work . I guess there were some unconscious aha's-- some inaudible shifting.   Whenever this happens I am reminded of the tectonic plates (are there a few kinds of plates?) that are  moving and shifting deep beneath the earths surface . We can't notice in any one moment that they are affecting the earth's surface- except for an occasional dramatic slip- but over long stretches of time, watching as if it is time lapse photography, there are definate changes. I feel like after the appointment, I was looking at myself 500 years ago and seeing 'wow, such huge changes and I never noticed until I stopped and compared'-- I don't know, this isn't quite the perfect analogy, or my words aren't matching the idea, but it was sort of like that.  Something else struck me as I was leaving the office: there is a train station right across the street from the counseling center. I have always been aware of it, and being an avid traveler always enjoy seeing it when I go there, and kind of bookmarked it in my head. This week, it finally began to click, and I tried to write a poem about it, then tried to write a song about it, and neither one seemed to work. It is a complicated thing-- there is something about  the combination of opening old wounds, and then immediately being given an exit route  that I find really exciting. When I leave the therapist, I feel exposed, open, vulnerable-- and to immediately see the train station-- I fantasize about running away,  as if I could somehow possibly run away from the conditioning that has created my suffering . It is pure fantasy- I know that old maxim "wherever you go, there you are" all too well.   But therapy also has been bringing up a lot of my dissatisfaction with my current life- my boredom, ennui, etc- and  exiting via the nearest train sometimes seems like the best solution . It reminds me of this idea I have long had for a story about a girl who disappears from the movie theatre while at a matinee with her lover. "I could just leave" she thinks to herself, walking out of the dark theatre on her way to get popcorn. " I don't want popcorn. I don't want to see this movie. I don't, in fact, want this life at all. " She sees the double doors, and decides to trust fate, knowing she has distant old friends and a reasonable bank account. I guess the character of the 'One Who Has Had Enough' is not an uncommon portrait... but it is intriguing to me nonetheless. I can relate to it. Even though ultimately I know that it is more beneficial to stay in relationships- that  intimacy is the only way to ever really be 'known' in this life - I can't help indulging an adolescent fantasy or two from time to time.   I sit in my car, crumpled tissue in hand, watching for approaching trains, thinking of all the places I could decide to go, and  all the places I might happen upon in my travels . I wonder if suicidal patients ever sit and consider jumping in front of one.  I wonder what other patients think to themselves when they see the Amtrak sign and hear the familiar crank-thud crank-thud .   I remember once when I was in New Mexico, my partner and I were standing by the railroad tracks and this train went by and it was going so incredibly slow. He was a few feet behind me, looking down scanning for interesting rocks. I could reach out and touch this moving train, and it was these empty flatbeds, and knew I could have just hopped on and laid staring up at the desert sun and gone for a nice long ride- and a part of me, what I call my fantasy self, did just that. My physical self, the one writing now, remained by the side of the train, noticing the crunch of dry dirt beneath my feet, keeping in pace with our lazy conversations. But part of me went away, and I don't think it ever came back. I wonder where I might find that part of me someday. Is this what they do 'soul retrievals' for? I have heard in shamanic cultures of this phenomenon where parts of the spirit split off and are left behind, or go in different directions than the rest of the spirit. I guess this is supposed to be an affliction, but I don't know.  I like the idea that at least one small part of me is laying on that flatbed, and riding that Amtrak off into the sunset .   Music : Cure, Wish. Especially 'Letter to Elise.'  Mood : Hopeful, Longing.  Miscellany : I did the math and realized I was probably conceived on New Years Eve, since my bday is exactly 9 months after that (9/28). My developmental psych teacher said that week is usually a busy week for births at the hospital.

      write something profound about this quote: "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds" (Emerson) and how it relates to feeling like I'm constantly on the verge of some kind of creative breakthrough but my damn habitual patterns get in the way- like being in bed by midnight, up by 9, et al ad nauseum. I feel like I am forever just one all-nighter away from pure artistic genius, and if I just had the courage to face myself, I could really do some masterful stuff.   Music : Cure, Wish; Loretta Lynn, Van Lear Rose.  Mood : Frustrated, Sleepy.  Miscellany : I dreamt the copier at work now xeroxes in color. I can't figure this inane dream out. Ideas?

      Trying to fill out my User Profile... so hard for me to fill those damn things out. I always feel like it's so oversimplistic, and somehow it seems to matter so much.  When I'm struggling with my own identity, these are some simple titles that bring me comfort (I am some of these things all the time, and some of them switch with my mood):  artist, writer, student, lefty (both politically and with regards to handedness), musician, yogini, yoga teacher, woman, critic, friend, lover, buddhist, libra, vegetarian, anarchist, quaker, traveler .   Ahh... there's some comfort to be taken in such simple, black-and-white titles on days when all identity feels false, lost, and compromised. These words are woefully inadequate when it comes to describing who I  truly  am, my essence, my spirit, my soul, et al, but somewhere at the intersection of them all lies a hint of the way in which  I am one unique breath of Spirit breathing Life . So one might say that all of these titles are emptiness, and represent me clinging to an identity whose true nature is empty, yadda yadda. I say,  if you play the game knowing it's a game, then all will come out in the wash .

      What the **** happened to this week? Looking back at my blog, I can't believe I haven't posted since Monday... feels like just yesterday. And already, it's late Thursday, another week winding down. So much for writing everyday.   This week has been a total blur. I've had more appointments than I care to count, and next week will be the same- eye exam, dentist, nutritionist, etc etc-- squeezing it all in before my insurance changes when I go back to school this fall. Tired of all the running around, though, haven't been enjoying my mornings before work. Didn't get to work out my usual 3-4x/wk, and that's a bad trend, because it's so easy for me to slack off a little more each week until I'm back to being lazybones again and I don't remember how it happened.  Summer semester starts next week and I'm a little concerned- a whole semester of course material squeezed into 6-8 wks- x2- plus full time employment. Hopefully the material will be enough to keep me energized... that and the lovely weather of a new england summer, which does wonders.

      Getting some feedback on my DuChamp quote posted below... thinking about it, I guess it  is  kind of a funny quote for an avid writer such as myself to have latched onto. I guess what I like is how it laughs at me, and reminds me of what a huge undertaking it is to ever try to express something in words.  Honest, authentic emotional expression can get places words can never go... anyone who ever felt slightly let down when someone said 'I love you' can attest to that.  The words are nice- but  show  me. I want to know for sure, and the best way to know something for sure is to have it lived out in front of me- raw emotion: crows feet on smiling eyes, impatient foot tapping, sighing lovers in union, embarrassed blushing.  Words can draw a circle around these things, but they are so inadequate , and so barely come close most of the time. It's kind of a joke to try to devote one's life to them, because ultimately they'll just betray you and mock you when you need them most. I think this happens because we all have very personalized definitions for the really important words (trust, commitment, passion, joy, et al) that we haven't even tried to figure out for ourselves- so when someone says something to us, what we hear is so often something completely different. Mwah ha ha... them words... thems elusive, sneaky scoundrels they are.   Ironically (or is it just unfortunate coincidence?),  words are the best hope we've got . In each of our ultimate aloneness, aside from raw emotional expression (which has its own problems with our assigning meaning, misreading each other with our own narcissistic evaluations, et al and is beyond the problem this blog will address today at least), all we've really got are our words to bridge that gap. Words and hopefully a whole lot of hope. So we better choose them well, and what better thing to devote one's life to than communication, which equals hope: that we aren't so alone in the universe after all, that  there is a small chance we might someday understand and be understood .   So I guess it's hope that keeps me coming back to words, and lots of it when I read that DuChamp quote and think to myself mwah ha ha... so wrong he is.  I want to defy him, defy his certainty ; his conviction is obvious in the quote (" absolutely no  chance for a word  ever  to express  anything ..."- his generalizations are preposterous and wonderful) and he boils my blood and moves me to act. I want to write to prove him wrong, show him that we aren't ultimately alone, that  we don't live and die as lonely ghosts , that we have tools that give us at least the  potential  to connect profoundly, and if only we took the time to become adept at using those tools,then  there is a world of depth and union to behold . And that prospect inspires me to go on writing, and that is one small reason I love that quote so much. Thank you.

      In answer to my own question, here are some of the things that I mean when I say 'I love you'. I think it would be really super cool  if everyone who reads this would post a comment  with a few lines of what  you  mean when you say the three magic words. I could be quite a beautiful collaborative poem. Let's keep it to what we mean within the bounds of romantic relationships... if we start getting into what we mean when we say it to mom and dad, this could get really long. Thanks!  What Do You Mean 'I Love You'? 1. I mean that I will make personal sacrifices for  your  greater good.  2. I mean I am irresistably attracted to your Essence, in the limited way I understand it.  3. I mean I am curious/enthralled, and want to learn you inside and out, so I can love your Essence objectively, and know you as a Truth.   4. I mean I trust you implicitly.   5. I mean I am gracious because you help me feel good about myself. My love is a great big 'thank you'.  6. I also mean that I am grateful, slightly in awe and proud that you would allow me to know you so intimately.  7. I mean there is something in each of us that mysteriously draws us closer, and I revel in that.  8. I mean you inspire me.  9. I mean that I accept you no matter what, so please don't be afraid.  10. I mean I believe our time together is a way of praying, and that in loving you I am also closer to loving God.  11...  ...

      Reading  The Art of Loving  by Erich Fromm... this is a wonderful, insightful book but I can't help but feel a little depressed for all of humankind. Aren't any of us ever going to learn how to really get over ourselves and love each other? He talks about his definition of mature love and at the same time it seems completely right on, rational, clear and compassionate, it also just hits me how far it seems we all are from it.   "Mature love is union under the condition of preserving one's integrity... a power which breaks through the walls which separate man from his fellow men, which unites him with others; love makes him overcome the sense of isolation and separateness, yet it permits him to be himself, to retain his integrity. In love the paradox occurs that two beings become one and yet remain two...  Only if I know a human being objectively, can I know him in his ultimate essence, in the act of love "...   okay, in rereading this pat definition, it sounds sort of melodramatic... but in the book he does well to define each of the words in the definition as a realistic truth, not phantasy (I like his 'ph' spelling of this word) or some idealized concept. You get the earthy reality of it.  Have I ever really even seen mature love as he describes it? Let alone experience it. Good lord, we've all got a lot of explaining to do to each other. Makes me want to treasure that magic word 'love' and be really careful with it. Also makes me want to second guess and criticize everyone I hear throwing it around all the time, myself included.  We like the word, but we don't back it up with the work that makes it meaningful .  After tearing down all of our false conceptions about love and defining its many forms, the final section of the book is called 'The Practice of Love', and it's where he really gets into what we're doing wrong, and what kinds of practices are necessary to begin to get better at this whole Loving thing. Some necessary traits to begin the practice:  ~~ Discipline - "I shall never be good at anything if I do not do it in a disciplined way; anything I do only 'if I am in the mood' may be a nice or amusing hobby, but I shall never become a master in that art."  ~~ Concentration - "To be able to concentrate means to be able to be alone with oneself- and this ability is precisely a condition for the ability to love. If I am attached to another person because I cannot stand on my own feet, he or she may be a lifesaver, but the relationship is not one of love. Paradoxically, the ability to be alone is the condition for the ability to love... To be concentrated in relation to others means primarily to be able to listen. Most people listen to others, or even give advice, without really listening. They do not take the other person's talk seriously..."  ~~ Supreme Concern - that is to say, in order to learn this art it must be of supreme importance  to you  that you learn it. "If the art is not something of supreme importance, the apprentice will never learn it. He will remain, at best, a good dilettante." How high up on the priority list is learning how to love for you REALLY? This is a difficult question to answer honestly, at least for me. It speaks of how much time and energy one is  actually  willing to invest in patiently learning one's relationships.   ~~ Overcome One's Own Narcissism - esp by learning to be objectively reasonable as well as humble. "I must strive for objectivity in every situation, and become sensitive to the situations where I am not objective. I must try to see the difference between my picture of a person and his behavior, as it is narcissistically distorted, and the person's reality as it exists regardless of my interestes, needs and fears." Here he also brings up the point of how important it is to use these skills in ALL of life, not just within the confines of an intimate relationship. He says for example "If someone would want to reserve his objectivity for the loved person, and think he can dispense with it in his relationship to the rest of the world, he will soon discover that he fails both here and there."  >0 Ahh and there is more still, I have not finished reading yet... I'll see if I can gut through the rest of it... I might have to refill my Paxil prescription first... lol. But it's a HOPEFUL book, and exciting to imagine achieving the high standard he sets... I think we have too much leeway with the word 'love', and in general accept far less than we ought to in the name of it. We also accept blindly that whoever is using it means it in the way we mean it when we say it. Does that make sense? lol... We assume everyone else defines love as we do. When in actuality, it's really hazy. Ask your lover today: what do you REALLY mean when you say 'I love you'?   Notice how we use the word love. Love is an action, not a feeling. We don't usually say 'I feel love for you', we say 'I love you'. We might say 'I feel loving today', which implies feeling expressive, active. Love is something we  do , something we enact upon the world, not something that happens to us passively that we are powerless in the face of. Remembering that it is a verb makes it seem more empowering, like there's more of a choice involved.   I think we get really caught up in this dramatic idea that we can't control our love, that somehow we don't have a choice in the matter. Sometimes it can feel that way, when things are difficult in a relationship but something is telling you to stick around and work it out. But that IS a choice- the hard choice, and a noble one if the relationship is really healthy and has some potential (and you aren't just sticking around because you are neurotically afraid of being alone). But it is a choice, and to me that makes it even more exciting, more passionate- that we would choose to stick something out when it gets hard, and put the long term priority of learning how to love before the short term discomfort of a small argument.

      Just saw a great bumper sticker with this quote on it. A nice reminder that most of what we think in any given moment is a neurotic jumble of no particular substance or importance in the end. Just stories we tell ourselves to pass the time.  Where do people get these cool bumper stickers? Send me a comment if you have any leads.

      As soon as I showed up at work today, everybody ( literally ) started complaining to me about everybody else. I am honored that they have all figured out that I will be a good and respectful listener, and won't 'tell' on them, but good  God . So much for cameraderie. So much for workers-of-the-world-unite. How else are we going to show our bosses who's  really  boss if we keep this schoolyard stuff up? I think we need to reconsider the seven deadly sins and think about putting petty infighting nearer to the top of the list. It creates more misery, and is more prevalent, than a lot of those other sins. I mean, there's not  that  much murder, granted any at all is too much. But we don't really need a rule for that one- most of us pretty quickly figure out it's a bad idea, and I'm sure for people who are capable of murder the fact that it's a 'sin' isn't really going to stop them. But who isn't guilty of petty infighting? Which sin does that fall under? Jealousy, greed? I don't know, I guess it's a blend.... but it feels like it's a new beast altogether.

      If I am going to commit to this blog thing, for real, and actually write regularly, then there's a few things you should know, and a few commitments I should make. 'You' being me, the person I write to when I journal, and 'you' also being you, the person who finds me in blogspace and reads my postings. 1. I have always been an articulate email writer. In most of my emails, I feel like I am writing in a more authentic voice than I speak in most of the time (being generally too shy for my own good, and too afraid of other people). As a writer, I am constantly trying to recreate the authentic voice of my emails in my essays ('creative nonfiction' my literary category of choice-- what a wonderfully vague distinction). I intend that this blog be a space where I can have the best of both worlds, finally be able to write and publish writing, in my own voice, as if they were emails, that feel private when writing, but are wonderfully public when finished. I am excited, and hopeful that my commitment to blogging will remain steadfast with time.   2. I have been a journaler since 2nd grade, and I think that predisposes me to being a good blogger. I have always been good at talking to myself. That being said, I am also secretly, terribly afraid that blogging will take over my journal-writing practice, and I will become terribly addicted to typing, and will no longer feel like journaling is worth my time. That being said, I know this transition has already begun, as I have been journaling less over the last few years, and find more and more satisfaction with email writing, and all of my creative writing (even poetry, the most ink-hungry of all writing genres I think) generally happens on a computer screen.   3. I have a few peculiar quirks that we should get out in the open early, namely: a difficulty in committing to long-term relationships, a need for friends who write/call me first, a penchant for deep ennui, existential depression, boredom, social anxiety and lack of sexual desire. I am basically afraid of any kind of extreme emotional expressions, most especially anger; I get scared easily by its intensity and although I secretly envy people's ability to express it, I avert my eyes in fear and embarrassment when it occurs. It is not personal, and I don't judge you at all for it. It is how I am, and I'm working on it. On the upside, I'm a great listener and am diplomatic in my dealings with others, even if I don't like you. I never hold a grudge and you are unlikely to find a more compassionate and thoughtful witness when you need one.  I have more, but will pause to come up for air for now.

      Did I just create a blog? That was  easy . I thought for sure I was being roped into paying for something. I like this. I like the new blogger design, too- a little Gap, but streamlined, sharp. Last time I tried to sign up for one, I was put off. I am easily put off by things with bad design.  This is me procrastinating when I should be studying for a final exam. This is me wasting time online when I have more 'important' things to do. Whoever invented the internet must have been the world's most committed procrastinator. I wonder what s/he should have been doing when s/he invented the internet instead. I wonder how many wonderful inventions/works of art/science/etc have been created in the name of avoiding other more 'important' activities. Funny how the stuff that is so 'important' to daily life isn't the stuff that matters in 100 years, isn't the stuff with real staying power. Like, for instance, the laundry is a pressing concern right now, but isn't likely going to be the thing that lives on in the memory of generations to come. Such it is.

      I had a good night at the  urlLink Hayden  concert on Sunday, and am going to try to put myself in a better mood by writing about it in detail.  First of all, the opening act was Drew O'Doherty (or was it O'Donnelly?). And I was surprised at how good he was. At first I was like 'ohh god another sensitive dude w/a guitar', but he actually had a really nice, kind of dark/shoegazer minor-key sound with nuanced lyrics that seemed to be grappling with loss, mourning and memory. And he was really warm and conversational with the crowd, which always makes an act, esp with singer-songwriters.   I used to be a big opening-act freak: I had to get there early, wanting to hear a new band, hoping that someday I could say 'Oh yeah,,, band XYZ, I saw them  before they were big , opening for so-and-so'... but I gave that up as I've grown older and realized that most opening acts- except when the bands tour together, it seems- kind of suck. Also I don't have the stamina to stand for another whole hour, listen to people standing around me get progressively drunker. The only purposes of the opening act (again, except when the bands are touring together) it seems to me, are:  1. to make you think you got more for your buck.  2. to give people time to get wasted so they'll be less inhibited when the headliner gets on.  3. to give the die hard fans time to push and shove their way to a satisfactory spot for the headlining act. Which gets easier the drunker people get, except for the ones that get more belligerent.  So I came early mostly for reason #3, and was well-pleased. As soon as the opening act finished, I slinked my way right up front and managed to get  next  to the tall blonde who I was afraid I'd be stuck  behind . Being 5'3", I always wish they would instate a rule that forces tall people (5'10" or over) to let short people (5'3" or under) stand directly in front of them. It just ain't right.  So Drew finished and, being that it would just be Hayden and his guitar, there was very little set-up time between acts, which again, always brings me joy not to have to stand around and listen to the house music and watch people get still-more drunk. Because by that time I've chosen my spot for the performance, and every minute waiting is another minute I might have to go to the bathroom and risk losing my spot, or another minute where a belligerent tall person might try to push into my space.   ANYWAY Hayden, in person, seems much warmer and more well-adjusted than one might expect just by listening to his music, which has a very distinct melancholy about it. On the stage, he is actually quite funny, sharing off-color anecdotes and memories of things that just pop into his head over the course of the show. He is by turns charming, flirtatious, sincere,  honest .   He has many story songs which involve the death, or implied death, of his protagonists. On the albums they come off as sort of 'man, can this guy see the bright side of  anything ???'-- in person, they seem more in the spirit or tradition of the murder ballad. You can see him kind of smirking as he sings some of the more tragic, slightly impossible lyrics, for example he has a song about an old love being eaten by a bear. At one point in the song, his delivery led the crowd to laugh out loud, and he said sarcastically  'it's not funny' .  He interacts with the crowd easily, and by the end of the show I felt like he had befriended us all as a unit. There were many moments where our behavior clearly affected his performance- in an encore cover of Otis Redding's "Sitting on the Dock of the Bay", he was unable to finish the whistling part as the crowd was distracting him by trying to whistle along as well; he ended up just laughing and trying to keep his composure. In another song, he seemed to honestly be soliciting our advice about his choice to perform a trumpet solo with his mouth since he can't afford to bring a trumpeter on tour with him. Again, he laughed when he tried to perform it, mostly because we were laughing, too, and throughout the performance there was this real conversation that seemed to be going on between him and Us. This is sadly a rare treat; at so many concerts we are lucky if we get a 'thank you boston'.  And did I mention he really ROCKS, and it was surprising how much intensity and rhythm he was able to create without the aid of a drummer or rhythm section. He was totally captivating and I found myself almost dancing at times, and slightly dizzy watching the intricacy of his strumming technique, trying to learn how he managed that kind of sound all by himself.  In the very last song he performed he gave us the opportunity to sing along, and I was surprised and heartened to hear how many people in the crowd knew every lyric to the song. During the chorus, a sort of 'la la la' variation, he stopped singing completely and let the crowd carry the show. He was so pleased that he had us repeat it a few times ('that was so good, do it again!'), and it felt like such a perfect ending, a way to give back to him some of the joy and energy that he had shared with us. Every 'la' I sung was more of a monosyllabic thankyouthankyouthankyou for the opportunity to actually have a fun, meaningful night.   It's strange, his music has always been like 'music-to-get-sad-to', but in person it all seems to even out. I became able to see how someone can embody a full range of emotions all at once, that being 'sad' isn't this one dimensional thing, that you can be sad and funny at the same time, that you can embody joy in one moment and in the very next moment be able to touch deeply the universality of human suffering. In fact, knowing that we all share this common struggle makes life easier, and creates the context of HOPE, which Hayden expresses much more of live than on his albums.   Amber stage lights reflected off of his polished guitar.  It smelled a sweet musk of vetiver and beer.

      Today there were so many things that went wrong I don't even know where to start. I suppose I will go chronologically.  1.  I overslept by a whole hour , still exhausted from a recent adventure to Cambridge and back, another long day of travel and open house-ing at Smith college, and classes to boot. I had to drive like a jackhole to get from Smith to class in time for an exam yesterday, and I just made it.   2. After being awake for less than 30 minutes, I was out driving and  I saw a man get hit by a car . An old man. An old man with a cane. A confused old man with a cane. The woman who hit him was a younger woman, and got out of the car and looked so freaked out and someone pulled over and tried to help, so I just drove on, wondering if I should have stopped since I saw the whole thing I could have given my account to the cops. But it seemed like others had already stopped, and I was running late... and I'm sure it wouldn't matter "outside of a small circle of friends"... He just got hit by the corner of her car, she was probably going 25 mph so it was low impact but still he flipped a few times and it was an upsetting and jarring morning. Could have been worse: I could have hit him, or been hit myself.   3. I went to the dentist and  they hit me up for $700  out of the blue (or is it $300? The bills are confusing and they still can't seem to figure out what portion my insurance is covering). I have been paying them $30/month every month for awhile now, and all seemed fine. Well, today things have apparently changed and they were so kind to write up a payment plan for me and now if I don't start paying them $76/month they will send the bill to collections. No warning, no nothing. And here I was thinking I was being so good for making timely payments. What I hate the most is how presumptuous these companies are when they set you up on a payment plan: they just assume you can afford whatever the amount  they  want is, it's never like 'oh, $30/month, okay, we can work with that', or looking for some compromise or something. It's just what they say, or its off to collections we go.   4. And did I mention while I was at the dentist they told me that  I might need a root canal ? Oh yeah, there's that. And with my insurance running out in September when I go back to school, lord knows when that will happen or if it will at all, again depending on what insurance will cover. Been thinking about dentures... or maybe just pull the tooth and give me a silver one or something. I'd like a copper tooth. That would be killah.  5.  Now I'm at work for 8 hours, which is a very particular kind of hell .  6. My  nutritional intake  has consisted of chocolate, water, yogurt and avocado rolls for a few days now. Am I in danger of rickets or anything?

      "Amidst the muck and slime of existence, I long to see your face." -??? (I always forget who said this)  Today I reached a new low of Mope. I feel completely disconnected from myself- walking around in a haze- feels like my spirit is hovering somewhere just slightly outside of my body, like I'm not really present in anything I'm doing. Eyes slightly glazed over and prone to staring blankly, no thoughts. It's funny how someone can have so few thoughts and still be so depressed. I guess when the thoughts that do wander through are bitter, angry and negative, it doesn't take many to wreck a mood.   The best way I can think of to describe this feeling is to say that I feel deprived. A sensory deprivation booth. I feel deprived of friendship, connection and joy. I feel disconnected from the free expression of love and empathy. I feel unknown even to those who know me best. I feel deprived of material comfort and the sense of identity these things can sometimes bring (ie a nice haircut, a few new pieces of clothing bought firsthand for a change, can help me feel like I'm actually embodying who I am inside on the outside). Deprived of the financial means to have basic needs met- ie, halfway decent healthy food from the health food store (or at least health food aisle)- fresh vegetables instead of frozen- et al.-- Getting the car repairs I need to feel safe driving. I feel poor. Which isn't too far from reality at this point. What a shame to waste some of the best years of my life (while I'm still young and have my health and some amount of vigor and lack of concern for repercussions) too utterly broke to enjoy myself.  Obviously I am lucky and blessed in so many ways. But today I choose not to see those things, and instead see all of the things I really want or need, things that I am trying to pursue or work to have but are painfully just out of reach, and feel frustrated and empty.  God, amidst the much and slime of existence, I long to see  your  face, to enter the kingdom, to put it in christian terms. The briefest moment of true union with Spirit would probably ease all of this struggle.

      How neglectful I've been to my poor world of Blog... a whole weekish and nothing... and here I am feeling guilty even though I'm sure nobody really noticed except me. See, I LOVE writing on my blog... but I've been so damn  busy ... but I know that is no excuse. If it were a priority, I would have made it so. Unfortunately, whenever my life gets busy the first things to go are all of the self-care things that feed my soul- the things I really like to do- the hobbies, the time alone, the writing, the art, the nourishing friendships and good conversations that feed me-- there's just been no time with this crazy summer semester and all the juggling I've been doing. Luckily, the education feeds me, I am really loving being back in school and learning actual *facts* and *knowledge*. What is draining is having to work a soul-sucking job for 40 hrs/wk on top of that. I mean... I work at a yoga center... one would think it couldn't be THAT bad, right? Well... I guess maybe it's just the baggage I'm bringing to it, I don't know... but things aren't how I thought they'd be here. Very much like any other 40 hr/wk lifeless office job. Tension headaches almost everyday on the drive to work... ahh repressed frustration so quickly becomes physical pain, doesn't it? I can easily complain to my coworkers that I have a headache 'this big', but it's not easy to say that they are all driving me nuts and I want to throw each of them out of a moving car-- nothing personal of course. So headaches let me translate my grief, frustration and suffering into some more manageable pathology. God bless ibuprofen for helping me stuff so many emotions each and every day. Whatever would I do w/out it?... Probably get a more satisfying job, I guess. Hmm. Back to homework.

      Maybe it's true that ultimately, we're all afraid of two things in life: 1. death and 2. being alone. And maybe we're only afraid of death because it's the only thing we  must  do alone. But then, maybe we're only afraid of being alone because it somewhat resembles death- not being seen, heard, experienced. Who am I if not in relationship to other people? True, deep loneliness feels like there will never be anyone to interact with again, and it looks a lot like death, like grieving for oneself, for one's cessation to exist in the social world. Even for someone committed to spending time alone, such as myself, when I am happy alone it is grounded on a stable knowing that I still 'exist' to the rest of the world, I am just choosing to not interact w/it at this time.  Another manifestation of these fears, and the one that seems the most frequent and hard to describe for me, is this feeling of disappearing when among other people. I suppose, for me, being alone is where I go to define myself, is how I nurture myself, is how I know who I am, but I also love being social, love my friends, etc. When I am with others, though, I often feel like I disappear. I have conversations, even with people I love, and they seem to always be about the other person, or about the other person's experience of me, and I rarely feel like I get the chance to authentically express myself.   I guess we all see the world through our own pair of goggles- we can't help experiencing somebody else through the lens of our own Selfness- but I long for relationships where I am seen as I am, not how I am expected or hoped to be. I want to be interacted with and respected as a separate entity, not just as a character who plays out whatever storyline my partner/friends want to play out on any given day. Am I the bad guy today? The savior? The best friend? The neglectful parent? Sometimes it seems everyone decides this except me.  Perhaps it's my fault for not having a more solid identity, or for not being more outgoing or assertive. But is that it- am I doomed simply because I'm introverted, and a better listener than talker? Although there are certain parts of myself that are very solid and concrete, and certain topics I am very opinionated about, a lot of the times I feel very malleable, not fixed, and thus prone to being projected-upon.  So often I feel like I am in the process of disappearing. It is hard to explain this feeling. An example I used recently that helped was likening it to Back To The Future, where Michael J. Fox's character has these pictures where the people in them are disappearing, and at some point in the movie, he looks down and starts to see his body evaporating before his eyes. Strangely enough, this is exactly how I feel when in these situations. I feel like if I were to look down, my body would gradually be pixelating and fading away in plain sight. Perhaps energetically it is a feeling of being so enveloped/wrapped in someone else's powerful, more dominant energy field, that I literally feel like my energy is dissolving into his/hers.   And yet, this feeling of dissolving, evaporating into someone else, is so similar to the ecstatic experiences explained in so many faiths- either through sexual union, union w/god, etc, this evaporation of the self/ego is exactly the point of Life. I guess the real point, though, is for two to dissolve into a third state- 'the two become one'- or unifying w/god, or creating a third energy field unto itself- not for one to disappear due to being dominated by another.  These feelings happen mostly in conversations or daily life. I generally feel 'in control' of the trajectory of my life- I don't mean to imply by all of this that I am not an active participant in my life. I generally feel fairly empowered, like I have choices, etc. I suppose it's more in my social relationships where this becomes an issue- this deep, abiding loneliness which I can't seem to break out of. Except for when I do.

      It is interesting to note that, as I came of age towards the end of high school and early college, and started to realize what love really looks like, I became obsessed with Woody Allen movies. His incessant, neurotic searching through the muck of divorce, anguish, depression, anxiety, etc for answers, meaning, security, true love was (and is) quite comforting for me.

      Sitting at the bus stop today, waiting for another yogini to come in from the city, James Taylor came on the radio- 'Fire and Rain'- and I was instantly transported back to middle school and this movie called Running on Empty with River Phoenix starring as a wonderfully tortured shy warm piano prodigy. There's a scene in the movie that features the song and I used to rewind and replay that one scene over and over again because I just fell in love with the song. And over the course of the week I had the movie rented, I watched it endless times because  I was learning what love felt like   by witnessing the feelings I was having for that River Phoenix character.   In retrospect, there are a lot of movies like this for me, a lot of characters who I have swooned over throughout the years, and they really have this bittersweet affect because they aren't real, people aren't really like that and if they were, they'd be 3-D and have flaws and inconsistencies that make them human. There aren't enough movies that portray love as this textured, oft-frustrating but ultimately meaningful and worthwhile thing. Instead love is portrayed as simple; love is adoration or addiction or obsession and worse yet, love is just good sex. It's difficult to sort through all of these messages and find out what love really is, what it's REAL potentialities are, when all of these 2-D idealizations are out there. What can be expected? What is worth fighting for? What is worth working for? What is settling for too little, what is asking for too much? In a world where divorce is becoming the norm, there aren't enough real-life models of healthy love, of true romantic partnership, to learn from. So instead we grow up watching these movies and thinking that this is what we have to look forward to. These 2-D dramatizations are what love is measured against.   And now,  Kate's Hall of Adoration , movie characters who I have loved over the years. (PS I am using the actors names because I have a terrible memory for movie characters names). (and these are in no particular order). 1. River Phoenix in Running on Empty (and his other silent-brooding typecast roles) 2. Ethan Hawke in Dead Poets Society (the quiet one brought out of his shell) 3. Robert Sean Leonard in Dead Poets Society (pursuing his passion) 4. John Cusack in Say Anything (and subsequent similar roles that I like to think of as grown-up Lloyd Doblers ie his characters in High Fidelity, Gross Pointe Blank) 5. Johnny Depp in Dead Man, Edward Scissorhands, Benny & Joon...  6. Christian Slater- he's worse than Depp, who tends to pick particularly offbeat characters- Slater picked for himself a slew of roles that got me swooning- Gleaming the Cube, Mobsters, Young Guns- first and foremost Pump Up The Volume.  These are the ones that immediately come to mind. Some of the more recent ones are Tobey Maguire in Cider House Rules, The actor in American Beauty who plays the neighbor... but really it's these older movies, because they were the influential ones when I was coming of age.   I read this quote on Amazon.com today which seems to relate:  "The crux of postmodernity is that there are two 'presents'." One is a 'spectre' present, a Virtual Reality techno-media simulacrum that makes the other 'real' present appear borderline, fugitive, elusive." T.R. Cattan   It seems like I am living two lives, also. The 'real' life is the one I am actually living, the earthy physicality of my body; the day-to-day communication with loved ones, etc... and then there is the other one, the 'spectre', which is a fantasy life built on expectations set up for me by falling prey to the influence of media-how I want to look, how I want to be romanced, who I want to love, what I expect from life, what success looks and feels like, etc. Is there any unifying of the two? How?

      Yesterday I got the bad news that my financial aid for the fall will not be sufficient for me to go to school full time and work only part time. I will have to either 1.work full time and go to school full time or 2.get a high interest personal loan and go to school full time. I can't find the right remedy for this dilemna. Last night as I was heading towards sleep I asked myself for a dream which would help me find an answer to this mild financial crisis. This is what I got.   I am pushed off the shore of England in a small round blow-up raft (that looks more like a kiddie pool) and I'm spinning and spinning in it, it's the centrifugal force that's keeping me afloat and heading towards my destination, so I keep paddling and sending my body weight around (like making a whirlpool when swimming) to keep it going in the right direction and to keep me from sinking. As I'm spinning I lean back and put an arm up and say "This is my Emancipation Proclamation!". I spin into 'port', which is this kind of cartoony looking Massachusetts coast town. I meet some sketchy people there, it's all this kind of shady dark cartoonish thing and I don't remember a lot except that I meet a man who is supposed to be my 'real' father- there's this whole vibe going on that I'm without family, that I'm an orphan, and there's this sort of Charles-Dickens-meets-Colonial-American-History thing. The whole thing had an undertone of family disturbance, all the people I meet are short and squat and I think there's some small children somewhere who are dying. The 'father' has an evil laugh and is overweight and short and sweaty with short curly hair. The dream ends with him going out to sea in his own boat and leaning back and laughing.  ***  Not a whole lot to go on here... anyone want to take a stab at it? I was more hoping that I'd get a dream telling me to go dig somewhere for hidden treasure, or telling me exactly what kind of job to get to maximize the hours I spend working. Guess I shouldn't expect something quite so straightforward from my dreams. In some shamanic dream work I did a few years ago we talked about dreams as having moments where they are the most energized, where there is the most power and wisdom to be gained from them. In this dream it's where I'm spinning in the boat and make the Emancipation Proclamation comment. That's like the 'climax' of the dream and the rest is the resolution. So maybe if I look into that aspect, do some free-associating on that, I'll find some wisdom there.  *** "That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord 1863, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States,   shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free ; and the Executive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom...  ...And I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free to abstain from all violence, unless in necessary self-defence; and I recommend to them that, in all cases when allowed, they labor faithfully for reasonable wages..."  -A. Lincoln from Emancipation Proclamation

      This weekend I took a workshop at Kripalu called "Mind, Mood and Happiness" where we learned some techniques, based on eastern spirituality, ie Buddhism, and western psychology, ie Gestalt and Positive psychology, to help us cultivate more 'wholesome' states of mind and mood. It inspired me to make a list of the self-care tools I now feel like I have at my disposal, that I can use as needed during times of distress. So with no further ado... (and in no particular order)  1. Meditation- including techniques: metta, tonglen, shamatha-vipassana 2. Reiki Self-Healing 3. Yoga Sadhana: Svaroopa, Kripalu 4. Self-Massage incorporating yoga, thai yoga 5. Aromatherapy and 'aesthetic-atmospheric' healing. 6. Accessing Positive Healing States in the Body (Gestalt) 7. Nonviolent Communication (Marshall Rosenberg) 8. Write: journaling exercises, lists, essays, automatic writing... 9. Art: collage to focus, paint to center... 10. Yoga Nidra 11. Sauna (when available) 12. Whirlpool (when available) 13. Fasting (esp  urlLink Master Cleanser ) 14. Replenish energy thru nature- esp walking, taking pictures, laying in the sun. 15. Naptime

      Today as I was driving I saw a bumper sticker:  "I (heart) Pure Maple Syrup" And it got me thinking. My first thought was 'hey, that's a cool bumper sticker' because, hey,  I  love pure maple syrup too. A  lot .  Then I began really rolling it over in my head. I started thinking 'what kind of fool  buys  this bumper sticker?'  I entertained fantasies of these really super gung-ho tourists and their sticky-pawed children buying the stickers , then actually sticking them to their cars. I imagined the locals laughing at them from their spots at the cash registers. It just seems like a silly way to commemorate a vacation to Vermont. Especially if you're from Massachusetts. Not exactly a distant land. I laughed and thought 'stupid yuppies' or some other classist remark against the wealthy (it's only because I wish I were wealthy that I think such things).  Ahh yes, but then I thought some more. I noticed the kind of truck it was on, beat up and rusty around the edges, with an ill-fitting cap. I could easily imagine that truck driving from maple tree to maple tree at the first thaw, tapping trees and hauling barrels of syrup around. I think of people  living in an eternal, wintry spring, where the rest of the year goes by in a blur and there are only three seasons: before tapping, tapping, and after tapping . Crisp, Vermont air, blue jeans, flannel shirts and dirt-drenched, sticky, sappy hands. Ahhh, maybe it's a local pride thing.   And still another level deeper, and I started thinking that maple syrup makers (are they technically farmers?) might be going through some hard times economically. Tourism is down, people are cutting corners, yadda yadda. Maybe the owner of this car is trying to raise awareness, to help create the desire for pure maple syrup again,  to whet people's appetites and invite them back to the syrup houses to get a fresh batch .   I thought about the fact that none of the cheap maple syrup in mass distribution actually has any maple syrup in it. Maple  flavor , yes, most likely chemically derived. But as far as I'm aware, Aunt Jemima and the like are all maple-flavored substitutes. How sad is that? Maple syrup doesn't even have maple syrup in it. And that people go for it anyway!!! People buy it- mostly because it's cheaper than the real stuff. So  actual maple-syrup-makers are being driven out of business by companies who don't even  make  maple syrup . What a slap in the face to the craft of treetapping. Although many actual-syrup companies are in wide distribution and you can find them in most grocery stores, when people are saving their dollars (which so many people are doing everyday esp these days) they go for the cheap maple-flavor because it's pretty tasty, too, and the real stuff is much more expensive. Who doesn't want to cut a corner and save a few bucks when they can?  I have a soft spot for real maple syrup, especially the darker ambers which are so sweet and sappy but also rich, dense and earthy. It's really a gift from the gods that trees give us this stuff (or that we have learned to take it) that is so yummy and lasts forever (if it's old just heat it and scrape off the top harmless moldbubbles) and even contains a bunch of healthy minerals. I think it's a decadent treat and then I think, no, this is nature as it is intended. This is what people ate before there was 'maple flavor', this is what people lived on. And what a shame that these natural gifts are now 'specialty foods', luxuries that only the well-off and the farmers who physically make the stuff can afford to eat.  How cruel to be economically shut out of eating food that is actually made of food ; how cruel, too, that people who make the stuff can't make a living wage without charging more than many are willing to pay. It looks like a lose-lose situation, so who is winning in this situation? As usual, I think that prize goes to a distant boardroom.

      I want to blog more but it seems lately that although I have a little more energy than usual, it is not a very articulate energy. Feeling socially awkward-- nothing new. Can't seem to find the right words.  In the meantime, I have been adding links and quotes and poems and reformatting a little bit, so things are still happening here, I'm just biding time until the words come back to me. Check out some of my links, they are cool.
