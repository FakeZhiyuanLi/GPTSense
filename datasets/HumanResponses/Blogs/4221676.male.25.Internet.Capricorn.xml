       By Sumantra Roy   A question that I frequently hear is "Do I really need to have my own  domain name?" The one word answer is "YES.". If you put up your site  with some of the free web hosting services, the only company who  benefits is the web hosting company. The last person who benefits is  you. There are a number of reasons why having your own domain name is  a must:   1) When you have your own domain name, the address of your web site  will be of the form http://www.yoursite.com. On the other hand, if  you put up your site on one of the free servers, the address of your  web site will be something like  http://www.somefreewebsite.com/yoursite/. Which of these two sounds  more professional? Which of these two is smaller and is hence easier  to remember? I leave you to make the judgement.   2) The only way to make money online is to build up credibility among  your customers. Having your own domain name is the first step in  doing that. Your customers will feel more comfortable buying whatever  it is that you are selling if you have your own domain name. It makes  your customers feel that they are dealing with a large, established  company, rather than with some fly by night operator.   3) When you have your domain name, you can have multiple email  aliases of the form alias@yoursite.com. This allows you to assign  different email aliases to different functions, all of them pointing  to your actual email address. Hence, for example, for questions  related to the products and services that you sell, you can have an  email address like sales@yoursite.com. For questions related to the  newsletter that you publish, you can have an email address like  editor@yoursite.com. For comments/suggestions about your web site,  you can direct your customers to feedback@yoursite.com or  webmaster@yoursite.com. Having different email addresses for  different functions not only makes it easier for you to filter your  email using your email client program (Eudora Pro, Pegasus Mail,  Outlook Express etc.), but also gives your customers the impression  that yours is a large, established company with whom it is safe to do  business.   4) Many search engines give a lot of emphasis to the home page of a  particular domain, i.e. other things remaining the same, a home page  of a domain will often rank higher for a particular keyword than any  other page. When you use some of the free hosting services, your  index.html page is the home page of your site, but not of that  domain. Hence in these search engines, your site will find it very  difficult to make it to the top 20 or top 30, let alone the top 10  for some of the really competitive keywords. Just think of the amount  of traffic that you will lose if this happens.   5) Some search engines are now refusing to spider the web sites which  are hosted by the free web hosts. For instance, if you have a site  hosted by the free web hosts, you would, until recently, have got the  infamous error message saying that too many pages have been submitted  from your site if you tried to submit your site to AltaVista. While  AltaVista now says that "your URL has been submitted for processing"  if you try to submit your site, rest assured that it will not spider  any site belonging to many of the free web hosts even though it says  that your site has been accepted. Can you afford that?   6) When your site is hosted by some of the free web hosts, you will  find it very difficult to get it listed in a major directory like  Yahoo!. Although Yahoo! will never admit that it won't add a  commercial site which is being hosted in one of the free web hosts,  in practice, it will be a miracle if you can get your site listed by  Yahoo!!. Listing your site with Yahoo! is difficult enough even when  you have your own domain. Don't make your task more difficult than  what it needs to be.   If you do not currently have a domain name, are you convinced that  you need one right now? The small fee that you pay per year for your  own domain name is peanuts compared to the benefits that you get.

        you should register yourself at JOKER.COM as reseller. This would give you the opportunity of registering domains through PGP-signed emails, and you will get considerable discounts (see Pricelist). For further information, please go to 'Resellers' .

      When Email Forwarding is activated, messages sent to a certain email address are forwarded to another address. For example: You have a domain at Joker.com. You get a huge amount of free emails associated with your domain(MyName@MyDomain.com). So if someone sends an email to MyName@MyDomain.com. The message is forwarded immediately to MyName@SomeOtherEmail.com. Why you need this? One of the main reasons is taht by using our Email Forwarding service you respond adequately to keeping your main email address SPAM free. The senders to MyName@MyDomain.com can not see your actual email address to which your mail is redirected. You can also filter your mails with our SPAM filtering service or block a specific email address from generating excessive traffic.

      Another name for this service is URL Redirection or Website Redirection. It means that when a user types in one address (URL) for a web site, he is being redirected to a site, often on a different server than the domain. Why you need this? Quite ofteh users have short, easy to remember URLs which they want to correspond to a destination page which is defined by a much longer, harder to remember URL. The new URL may be on the same server or a different one and may itself be subject to redirection. The user is normally unaware of this process. But when he types in a URL and is redirected to a new one, won't he see the new long and unpopular name? Yes, he will but not if you use our Frame Forwarding service (also called Cloaking or Domain Masking). So let's summarize it. Masking the destination Web address (also called Cloaking) is a technique whereby your domain name www.MyDomain.com is forced to show up in the browser instead of your destination URL, say, http://www.geocities.com/mydomain/. Thus, visitors to http://www.geocities.com/mydomain/ would see www.MyDomain.com in their browser. The technique works best with a Web site that has a long URL, typically associated with free hosting.

       By Mike Banks Valentine   Domain names are becoming "hot" property - as in *theft* for resale.  More and more companies are finding they cannot get their trademarked  names as a domain name because so few good names are left. But  sometimes it's outright extortion as when a Fortune 500 company name  is reserved by someone that has no intention of developing a site  under the domain, but simply "parks" it somewhere and waits to be  contacted by the big boys to purchase the name for astronomical fees.  A more lucrative market for domain names exists in short, memorable  generic names like Loans.com or Homes.com which can apply to an  entire industry as can be seen in recent news.  One of the lesser known and more frustrating issues is when a small  business name or new product domain name is reserved by someone  hoping to make a buck or two. Here's a question faced by small  business owners getting started online.  "I've trademarked a name, but the domain name is taken, it was  reserved by another company right after I registered my trademark. Do  I have a legal right to the domain name?"  The following link is to a page titled "Domain Names, A Trademark  Owner's Nightmare"  http://www.mdweblaw.com/home/domainnames.html  It discusses legal issues and cites two cases that have been taken to  court over domain name hijacking.  People who do this may be doing it intentionally or innocently, but  generally, you don't have a case unless you've got a long established  use of the trademarked name and can prove that the registrant was  intending to extort excessive fees from you in the hopes you'd buy  the name back from them.  You can take it to court if you like, but it's not likely to do you  any good unless you can prove that the registrant had the intent to  squat on the name and not use it, hoping that you would be willing to  pay excessively to get it back.  Still, the case may cost you more than it's worth.  This is an unresolved battle with more and more companies. Until laws  are passed (not likely) there will be no way to protect a domain name  other than being the first one to reserve it. You may have a case if  they are harming your business in some way by the inappropriate use  of that name. But if they are simply using for another purpose, you  might consider selling them the trademark instead. ;-)  Contact the registrant of www.your-trademark.com to see who it is,  there's a way to find the registered owner by going to this address  and typing in the domain name.  http://www.networksolutions.com/cgi-bin/whois/whois/  It will return a registrant name, host name and the name servers. You  might consider contacting them and simply explaining your trademark  situation, your desire to own the name and then simply ask if they  would consider a reasonable solution. Possibly something as simple as  a suggestion that you'd like to avoid a court battle and make it  worth their time to sell it to you by offering twice what they paid  for it.  If they have not spent large sums developing a branding strategy for  the name, they may be willing to give it up. If it's only few months  old it may be possible that they haven't begun to develop their site  or their strategy yet. You may be assuming the worst but then be  confronted with a friendly and accomodating person willing to look  for an equitable solution!  Good luck with your own names and trademarks!  -------------------------------------------------------- WebSite101 "Reading List" Weekly Netrepreneur Tip Sheet Ezine  emphasizing small business online http://website101.com/arch/

      By George Edwards  Once you have figured out a name for your ?domain? it can be really  confusing trying to decide on what should go after the ?dot? (i.e.  com, net, org, etc?) in your domain name. This part of the domain  name is referred to as a top-level domain (TLD) and knowing the  difference between each top-level domain is important when choosing  your domain name.   Below are the descriptions of the best known top-level domains:   .com ? This is the most popular TLD. It is used mainly for US  commercial organizations. BUT, in its capacity, it represents the  highest standing for any domain name. Anyone can have a ?.com?, but  it is more difficult to think up a unique name that hasn?t already  been registered.   .net ? This is the second most popular TLD. It generally describes  the entity owning the domain name as a network and is used mainly by  organizations that provide network connection services.   .gov ? Generally used for government agencies.   .int ? Intended to be used for sites relating to International  Treaties or containing international databases. For this reason, it  is not widely used.   .mil ? Mainly used by military organizations of the US government.   .org ? In general, non-profit organizations tend to use this  extension.   .name ? This is a new TLD and is intended to allow individuals to  register their names (i.e. firstname.lastname.name) as a personal  domain name on the Internet.   .biz ? This is a new TLD for businesses; ?.biz? is intended to be an  alternative to the ?.com?.   .info ? This is also new, and is freely available to anyone with a  business, government or non-commercial site.    George Edwards M6.net  http://www.m6.net

       By Derek Vaughn   So you tried to register the perfect domain name and it was taken.  NO! Really?!?! Of course it's taken! Unless you can transport  yourself back to 1997, you'll have a tough time getting a single  phrase English language domain name. Here are some tips to help you  out.  Quit Messing Around with New Domains  You know it, I know it ? the good names are already taken. Don't  settle for a hyphenated or number-ridden domain name. What you need  to understand is backordering expired domain names.  Every day around 15,000 ? 20,000 domain names expire. Some are  completely useless. Others have real value. For example, recently  ?shelves.com' expired. So what resources do you need to understand  which domains are expiring?  1. deleteddomains.com ? this site has a great search feature which  let's you see expiring and on-hold domain names by keyword. This is a  core resource for uncovering the domains that you want which are soon  to expire. 2. pool.com ? another great site for viewing soon-to-expire domains.  Also offers a keyword search and backordering service. 3. snapnames.com ? the original backordering service. Once you find a  domain that looks attractive to you ? go to snapnames and you can  ?backorder' it for $69 per domain name. That price includes the first  year of registration fees if the domain is acquired for you.  Other Tips and Tricks  Remember to be fast ? many other people are using the same tools in  an attempt to acquire the very best expiring domain names. Therefore,  this is a very, very competitive business. Additionally, SnapNames  will only permit one backorder prospect per domain name ? so you need  to act quickly if a name is available for backordering.  Be patient ? remember there are 15,000 ? 20,000 names expiring every  day. Your ideal name may not come along for a month or two ? or even  longer. Don't worry ? there will always be a fresh set of domains  expiring tomorrow and the next day and the next day.  Expand your set of keywords ? don't limit the scope of your search.  You can search far and wide but still be choosy about which domains  to acquire. So use as many variations of your keywords as possible.  Good luck and happy searching!

      Mar 12, 2003 | From CircleID Legal Issues  By Philippe Rodhain  The purpose of the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy, known as the  UDRP (hereafter the "Policy"), is to determine disputes relating to  the registration or acquisition of domain names in bad faith. To  succeed in a UDRP action (i.e. to obtain cancellation or transfer of  the disputed domain name) it is necessary for the party bringing the  complaint (the complainant) to show that (i) the disputed domain name  is identical with or confusingly similar to a trademark or service  mark in which the complainant has rights; (ii) the domain name holder  (known as the respondent) has no right or legitimate interest in  respect of the domain name; and (iii) the domain name was registered  and is being used in bad faith. Each of the aforesaid three elements  must be proved by the complainant to warrant relief.  A serious problem may arise for the complainant if the disputed  domain name had been registered in good faith, but was renewed and  was being used in bad faith. The cause of this problem lies in the  fact that the Policy speaks only in terms of "registration" and "use"  and not in terms of "maintaining" or "renewing" the domain name  registration. Furthermore, panels have always strictly maintained the  conjunctive requirements for the complainant to prove that the domain  name in issue had been registered and was being used in bad faith:      "It is clear from the legislative history that ICANN intended  that the complainant must establish not only bad faith registration,  but also bad faith use." (WIPO administrative panel decision of 14  January 2000, Case No. 99-0001, World Wrestling Federation  Entertainment, Inc. v. Michael Bosman).   Accordingly, how can the complainant satisfy the bad faith  requirement in such a context? Can the renewal of a domain name  registration made in bad faith convert a name originally registered  in good faith to a name registered in bad faith for the purpose of  the Policy?  A clue to the answer can be found in the Report of the World  Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Internet Domain Name  Process, which stresses that the Report was not intended to extend  the definition of abusive registration to include domain names  originally registered in good faith. Indeed, paragraph 197 of the  Report reads as follows:      "The WIPO Interim Report recommended that a time bar to the  bringing of claims in respect of domain names (for example, a bar on  claims where the domain name registration has been unchallenged for a  designated period of years) should not be introduced. It was  considered that such a measure would not take into account that the  underlying use of a domain name may evolve over time (with the  consequence that the use of a domain name may become infringing  through, for example, the offering for sale of goods of a different  sort to those previously offered on the website); that any related  intellectual property rights held by the domain name holder may  lapse; and that a time bar would in any event be undesirable in cases  of bad faith".   Read in conjunction with paragraph 198 of this report, it is clear  that the reference in paragraph 197 to "infringing" was intended to  apply to the wider category of trademark infringement, not to the  narrow category of abusive registration. The question whether domain  names registered in good faith can become infringing is outside the  scope of this inquiry.  The Policy, which was based on the above report, sets out examples of  behaviour that constitutes bad faith holding of a domain name:      * the disputed domain name was registered or was acquired  primarily for the purpose of selling, renting, or otherwise  transferring the domain name registration to the complainant or to a  competitor of that complainant, for valuable consideration in excess  of documented out-of-pocket costs directly related to the domain  name; or      * the disputed domain name was registered in order to prevent the  owner of the trademark or service mark from reflecting the mark in a  corresponding domain name, provided that the domain name holder has  engaged in a pattern of such conduct; or      * the disputed domain name was registered primarily for the  purpose of disrupting the business of a competitor; or      * by using the disputed domain name, the domain name holder has  intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, Internet  users to the web site or other on-line location, by creating a  likelihood of confusion with the complainant's mark as to the source,  sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of its web site or location  or of a product or service on its web site or location.   All of these examples relate to the registration and/or use of a  domain name only. The Policy could have been drafted to address both  bad faith registration and renewal. It does not do so, referring only  to a registration having been obtained in bad faith.  Consequently, panels, who are bound to apply the Policy strictly,  have always refused to take into consideration the renewal of the  domain name registration in the process of making their decisions.  The second part of this article will discuss UDRP cases involving the  renewal of domain name registrations.

      The options most usually made available to resellers include "volume discount" reselling, discount per domain, affiliate and private label reselling. Learn more about each. An excellent higher-tier Web host truly values its relationships with resellers. Through such relationships, a Web hosting firm enhances the market reach of its product and services offerings through the reseller's specific market segments. A higher-tier Web host will thus offer a myriad of specifically tailored services to enhance the reseller's service offering. By providing a wide range of options, a reseller's business can scale along with its customer base. The options, or resale models most usually made available to resellers include "volume discount" reselling, discount per domain, affiliate and private label reselling. The volume discount approach provides increased revenue per domain as the reseller increases the number of accounts within their hosting portfolio. This model is extremely cost-effective for larger resellers, since the cost per account declines as the volume of accounts increases. The major disadvantages of this model however are that resellers are usually directly identified as resellers, since the infrastructure and brand identity throughout the entire Web hosting service is usually identified with the higher-tier hosting provider. The model also is not very advantageous to newer and smaller reseller operations which have just started-up, since reselling under this model is much more expensive if the reseller's customer base is small. The more advantageous reselling model for the start-up reseller operation is therefore the discount per domain model. Under this approach, higher-tier Web hosting firms offer discounts to the reseller per account purchase. Most start-up resellers first elect to purchase this type of service because i) it is the hosting option with the least expensive cost of entry and ii) the option provides substantial savings as the reseller's customer base grows. The most advantageous discounts offered usually range from 15 to 30 per cent of the original account's price. With the reseller able to set the retail price for its consumers, profitability can accrue very quickly via this resale model. The other popular resale option is affiliate reselling. Under this model, resellers are offered a simple, uncomplicated payment structure that pays commissions on all referrals for Web hosting services and hosting accounts that recur monthly. This option is extremely popular with smaller Web designers, developers and system integrators, since it allows them to collect an up front fee for placing their client's hosting services at a particular higher-tier Web hosting firm. By utilizing this option, system integrators need not spend thousands of dollars to offer their clients hosting infrastructure that is constructed in-house. In wide contrast, integrators can collect a fee while relocating the rather involved responsibility of hosting onto a firm that makes hosting its core competency. While this resale approach will satisfy most small system integrators, it would not likely satisfy a value-added reseller (VAR). A VAR is a vertical, market-centric, solution provider who integrates specific products into its own offering as part of a complete customer solution. Because VARs are focused upon providing transparent and integrated products and services, they usually select private label hosting solutions. Private label hosting allows resellers to utilize the services of an outsourced, higher-tier service provider while reaping the benefits of a fully customized look and feel. Private label solutions are considered the most complex since most offer a high level of customization and automation. For this reason, private label solutions have the most expensive cost of entry, and are used by the largest of resellers, who posses hundreds and even thousands of accounts.

      The transfer process requires Network Solutions to obtain authorization from the Administrative Contact listed in WHOIS for that domain name. Once we receive approval from the Administrative Contact, a request will be sent to the current domain name service provider (registrar) to complete the transfer. Often, the current registrar will send a second request for authorization. The transfer request will not be successful unless both of these authorization e-mails are confirmed.

      What does the status "redemption period" mean? What is "pending  delete"?  "Redemption Period" is a 30-day timeframe after a registrar has  deleted an expired domain such as .com, .net and .biz domains.     "Pending Delete" as it applies to .com and .net domains refers to the  5-day timeframe after Redemption during which time VeriSign holds the  domain and it cannot be recovered.  "Pending Delete" as it applies to .org domains is the 30-day  timeframe after the registrar (PIR) has deleted an expired .org  domain.     To check a status of a domain go to the registry website:    www.verisign-grs.com  (VeriSign Global Registry) for .com and .net  www.pir.org (Public Interest Registry) for .org domains   www.neulevel.biz for the .biz domains  Enter the domain in the WHOIS box...it will tell you the status of  the domain (i.e., Redemption Period).   This will list the expiration  date as well.  The "updated date" is usually when the the 30  redemption or pending delete period began.  In General   After a domain expires, most registrars have a grace period of 1 - 45  days, during which time you can reactivate your domain.    After the grace period, the domain is deleted from the registrar  database and will not appear in your account.  It is not available to  register just yet.  Once deleted, the domain is held for 30 days by the Registry.  Once  the domain is dropped it becomes available for anyone to purchase  just like a new name. eNom Grace Period Procedures  When a domain is registered and expires through eNom, it will remain  available for reactivation at your regular domain rate.   Currently, eNom offers a non-guaranteed 30 to 40 day grace period for  renewal. There is no guaranteed grace period, and once expired, the  domain can be deleted from eNom's database at any time.  Once deleted, the domain will no longer be in your account and will  not be on your expired domains list.   You might consider adding multiple years to your domain to avoid  unintentional expiration. eNom Redemption Period Process  Once deleted from our database, it falls into the 30-day holding  status called Redemption Period at VeriSign and NeuLevel, and Pending  Delete at PIR.org.  Should you want to retrieve the domain during Redemption, there is a  $200 fee to you plus the cost of the renewal for all TLDs.  Only the previous registrant has the right to request the domain  back.  All others must wait until the registry drops the domain.

       One of the most important decisions you'll make for your business Web site is selecting which Web hosting service will display your Web pages to the Internet.    So, what to look for?    Size of Pipeline. The host computer is connected to the Internet backbone typically by T1 and T3 lines. A T1 can carry up to 1.5 mbs (megabits per second), while a T3 can carry 45 mbs. Small ISP hosts sometimes have ISDN connections to the Internet, or "fractional T1" connections (part of a T1). Look for T3 if you can, though a T1 isn't close to its maximum capacity. The expense of installing an adequate pipeline to the Internet is the chief barrier to setting up your own Web server computer in your office; telephone and other charges are pretty stiff, unless they can be shared with other businesses. Another alternative to explore is "co-hosting" your computer at an ISP's location to take advantage of his connection to the Internet.    Number of clients per machine. Ask how many business clients are assigned to each of the ISP's computers. (Don't be surprised to find out that many good ISPs use fast Pentium computers rather than something more exotic.) You may not learn too much by asking this, but you do learn if the ISP has any policy limits at all.    Space. ISPs usually assign you a certain amount of space on their computer. 5 MB is plenty of space for the Web pages and graphics for most business Web sites. I once jammed nearly 800 files and graphics into 5 MB. But ask if mail, log files, and system programs are counted in the 5 MB; these can sometimes take up considerable space. Web hosts which include mail and log files in the count commonly offer 15 MB minimum.    CGI-bin Access. Business accounts need to be able to reference programs in a cgi-bin directory, which includes a cgi program which generates the e-mail message sent out by Web page forms. So long as a good forms-to-email program is available in the host's main cgi-bin, that may be all you need. If you or your Web site developer need to write custom programs, though, you'll need your own cgi-bin directory. But here's the problem. Most Web hosting ISPs allow FTP access to a cgi-bin directory but not Telnet access. This can significantly slow down programming development time. If you don't have Telnet access, for example, you won't be able to compile any programs written in C or C++. You have to rely on the ISP's technical support to do that for you -- when he gets around to it. ISPs say that limiting Telnet access helps them keep out hackers, which is true. But if it is at the cost of getting your Web site working, the cost may be too high. Ask: "Do you allow us Telnet access to a cgi-bin directory?"    Virtual Hosting. These days nearly every ISP offers what is called "virtual hosting" or a "virtual domain." This allows you to have your own domain name such as http://www.yourcompany.com rather than use your ISP's domain name with a subdirectory designating your site, such as http://www.isp.com/yourcompany/. You definitely want virtual hosting. Sometimes an ISP will offer something called a "vanity domain" such as http://yourcompany.isp.com. Don't bother. Pay $100 to register a real domain name, and consider that an investment in marketing your company on the Web.    E-Mail Aliases. Once you have a virtual domain, ask your ISP how many e-mail addresses you are allowed. Many ISPs allow you to set up multiple "aliases" such as sales@yourcompany.com or info@yourcompany.com. Also ask if different aliases can be forwarded to more than one e-mail address. For example, I have a client with partners in Germany as well as offices in California, with e-mail aliases for each of them. For the smaller business, you probably don't need POP (Post Office Protocol) e-mail boxes on your Web hosting site. The POP e-mail box you have with your local access ISP is probably enough. But larger businesses may want to have multiple POP e-mail boxes at the Web hosting ISP.    Dependence. How free are you to choose another Web hosting ISP if this one doesn't work out? If your Web site developer provides hosting, what kinds of contracts lock you into using those services and for how long? So long as your name is listed as the "Administrative Contact" with InterNIC, you can transfer your domain to another ISP, though your previous ISP can slow down the process unless he cooperates. Make sure your Web site developer isn't listed as the Administrative Contact or it may be more difficult to switch to a new developer if the need arises.    Support. How many hours a day are technical support staff available? How quickly do they respond? How much help do they provide? If you need 24-hour technical support -- and larger companies and high-traffic Web sites do -- then expect to pay substantially more. People are much more expensive than machines    Author: by Dr. Ralph F. Wilson

          Basic Hosting Features    If there's one word in the world of hosting that misleads the naive surfer, it's "unlimited". To put things into perspective, there is nothing a Web host can offer you that is unlimited. It may be unmetered, or unrestricted (limited only by the specifications of the server), but never unlimited.    Be wary of hosts that make heavy use of this word: it's a marketing ploy that many people have fallen for, particularly when they haven't done much background research. Typically, servers that offer unlimited bandwidth and disk space tend to be over-subscribed and the service they provide can be negatively affected as a result.    1. Disk Space    All hosting accounts offer a certain amount of disk space that you can use to store your files. Exactly what is and is not counted as disk space usage will vary from host to host, so make sure you check exactly which files you'll need to allow for when deciding the disk quota you'll need.    It would be a good idea to have some sort of estimates on the space you'll need for various tasks. How much space will you need for storing your email, Web files, databases and log files? Breaking down your usage like this will make the task of work out how much space you should go for (once you know exactly what files are counted towards your disk quota) much simpler.    All plans will certainly include all your Web-accessible files when calculating disk usage. Some hosts will also choose to include email and/or logs in the quota, which can make estimating your disk space requirements more difficult. While you may have a good idea of the disk space needed for your web files, your email and log file needs probably change constantly.    Should a host include all types of file storage in the quota, check to see if you can switch off your logs or exclude particular information. If the option is available it may save you a lot of disk space, particularly if you have a busy site. However, if you want to use a statistics package, you will need to allow space for some logging to take place.    If you enable your logs then it is also worth remembering that you might not be able to delete a log file from the server until the server has stopped writing to it. Daily logs are fairly manageable if you remember to log in and download and delete them regularly. Problems with monthly logs can arise if you underestimate your log space needs, and then find you can't delete the file until the end of the month. This could easily lead to an extra charge if you aren't careful.    If your email settings and inboxes are included in your disk quota, it might be an idea to set a maximum size for each mailbox if possible. This will save you from storing too much mail on the server and inadvertently going over your limit.    2. Email Accounts    Email accounts are a common feature of hosting, particularly if you host a domain. Some hosts will give you control over your mail settings, putting restrictions on mail activities (for example, the number of accounts or maximum size of mail boxes) on the server side. Other hosts will do all the set up for you, even though setting up new mail accounts can be easier than you think with the right software support.    How you configure your email is a matter of personal preference, but there are essentially four main types of mail accounts; POP3, forwarding, aliases and autoresponders. POP3 accounts are the traditional "inboxes". You have storage space on a server for your mail, and you use an email program to log in and download your mail. Each login and password combination usually equates to one account. This works a bit like an office inbox, and the mail is left there until you do something with it. If the inbox is full then your mail can't be stored, and will bounce. Forwarding mail accounts are useful if, for instance, you want to send your mail to an email filters service like SpamCop before you receive it. Rather than store it on your mail server, it will redirect all mail to another single email address which will deal with it appropriately. This kind of account is useful for redirecting your emails to a common POP3 box. Aliases are names that can be used to identify different types of email account, redirecting them to POP3 mailboxes on the server or other addresses, where they are processed again if necessary. What happens to the emails will depend on who they're being sent to. A catch-all alias is often used to collect and deal with email sent to people or departments that are not recognised by your mail server. Autoresponders are not an email account in their own right, however they do have their own email address and simply reply to anyone that emails them for information. They are useful if you want to send out pre-prepared information to people who request it, as opposed to you having to reply to all the requests manually.    Autor by Rosemarie Wise

          One of the most important business relationships for a Website owner (whether the site's for business or pleasure) should be with a Web hosting company.    After all, you pay a host to look after your site -- you should expect them to take good care of it. So it stands to reason then that host selection is important for anyone who manages or runs their own site.    This Guide to Hosting is in two parts. Today we'll: look at why it's important to choose the right host, review a hosting assessment checklist you can adapt to yur needs, and consider the aspects of shared or dedicated hosting, and choosing server software.    Then, in Part 2 , we'll explore in detail the basic elements you should consider as you develop your checklist and assess different hosts, including: disk space email accounts FTP Access data transfer bandwidth multimedia support ...and more.    But first, let's look at why the choice of host for your site is so important. Saving Face -- and Money!    How your chosen Web host looks after the server that hosts your site will reflect on you as the owner of the site. If the site is frequently unavailable due to unreliable servers, poor server configuration or the server simply being unable to handle the traffic your site receives, this will give your users the impression that you don't really know what you're doing. This is bad enough with hobby sites, but is of particular concern if you run a virtual store, or have potential employers trying to view your online portfolio.    We'd all like to think that once our site's up and running, it'll always be available to everyone who wants to view it, whenever they want to. But as we all know, this certainly isn't the case. There will always be those times when a site you try to visit isn't available for whatever reason. That is, unfortunately, the unpredictable nature of the Internet.    If your site is a business site, it could suffer from the lost opportunities to take orders or enjoy brand exposure, and personal and hobby sites, too, could miss revenue opportunities while they're unavailable. Even not-for-profit sites can get a poor reputation if visitors find them unavailable or slow to use.    While the potential loss of revenue is the most obvious reason for wanting to choose a good host, your decision can often have other ramifications than simply up-time. Quite often a problem with a host can affect the other services associated with your domain. Services such as email and FTP could also be affected, so you might find that while your site's down, you're also unable to check your email. Worse still, email messages could be returned to the sender, giving your visitors the conclusion that the site no longer exists... Service Level Guarantees    While undoubtedly some downtime will be beyond our control, we can reduce the risks if we choose the host that is most suitable for the needs of the site. Any host worth their salt should inform you of any scheduled downtime before it happens via email, which will allow you to make alternative plans should you need to. Of course there is no way to predict any unscheduled downtime, but many hosts will offer an uptime guarantee that compensates you in some way for any downtime over and above that scheduled. The hosts that are more confident of their levels of service will usually offer better terms of agreement than will their less competent counterparts.    It's one thing to think that you're covered by these up-time guarantees, but quite another when you think you actually have a claim for compensation. It may be an idea to keep both a print and an electronic copy of the Terms of Service and any other important documents from the day that you purchase a new hosting plan, just in case.    Often problems can occur simply because you aren't able to monitor the site yourself 100% of the time. There are, however, products and services that can carry out various tests to check whether your site is live. But even if you can prove that your site was unavailable to you (or to your monitoring service) for more than the agreed acceptable level, you should always check the small print: if the problem wasn't your host's fault, they may not need to pay up! You get what you pay for!    One thing to remember is that there is a host for every site. My perfect host could be your perfect hosting nightmare! A server that is well suited for one of your sites may slow down another. And there's no right host, so don't even try to visit and assess them all.    Remember, it's in your best interests to find the most suitable host set up for your site that you can afford, otherwise you can easily get a reputation for being unreliable, unresponsive and uncaring. Building a Checklist    Before you begin to look for a host for your site, you really need to establish a checklist - a method that you can use to rate and score any host that you're interested in. Of course, before you can assess any service, you'll need to have a good idea about what features you want your future host to offer. This is where a checklist of every feature you're looking for -- and a collection of questions you want to ask -- comes in very handy.    Preparing a checklist before you search for a new host can save you both time and money in the longer term. It forces you to prioritize the various features of your site, which is handy when you have a restricted budget and need to make compromises between features and cost.    This guide has been designed to help you prepare a checklist of features that are tailored to your particular site's needs or expected future potential, regardless of whether you know the type of hosting features you want.    Once you've compiled your checklist, you'll be able to assess much more quickly whether a particular host is suitable for your site. Since many hosts fight for a site owner's attention (and hard-earned cash!), you'll probably find yourself referring to your checklist frequently during your research. But this works both ways - it would be silly to host your site with the first service you came across that matched your criteria, given the vast number of hosts out there. Be discerning. Rating the Hosts    Once you have put your checklist of features together, you can then use it to help you rate each of the hosts. Exactly how you go about doing this will depend how important each of the features are to you. If you've sorted the features on your checklist in order of importance, then you can simply award points on a sliding scale, 1 point for the least important thing, 2 for the second least important, and so on. Then when you assess each host, award them a point for each feature they offer that's on your checklist, and add them up to reach a final score.    Here are some of the features that I personally look for in a host. Support for PHP (least important) User Control Panel Site Statistics Support for ASP and Perl Price below ?10 a month (most important)    When I visit potential hosts I compare the features available with my checklist. The example scoring system shown above favors the cheapest hosts first (cost is important to me, as mine is a hobby site). If I were seeking hosting for a business site, then the cost obviously wouldn't be so important, as the quality of the service itself would in this case be the critical element. But whatever bases you use to rate each host, the one that offers the most of the features you want will achieve a higher score.    The sliding scale is probably the easiest way to convert your checklist into a score or rating, but it is by no means the only way. If you have two or more features that are equally important, then you can give them all the same score. However you use the checklist, it's sure to make the process of host assessment easier. Remember, you get what you pay for.    It's a sad but true fact of life that many of us have very small hosting budgets. While there are hosts out there that can offer a rather tempting deal at pocket money prices, don't expect these hosts to offer the kinds of guarantees that come with similar but more costly packages. If your site is going to be important to your business or livelihood, do yourself a favor and look upon your hosting as an investment rather than an expense. The extra cash helps to pay for things like infrastructure, back ups and security, so if anything does go wrong you'll be in a better position to do something about it.    A checklist is a good way to sort out which hosts are most likely to offer the kind of hosting you want, but there really is no substitute for doing that extra bit of research in newsgroups and on message boards once you have your potential host short list. The people who will know best how a host performs will be the customers themselves, and unfortunately they can be quite hard to track down at times. Having said that, it shouldn't be too hard to identify hosts you should avoid, as most unhappy customers like to share their experiences with likeminded individuals.
