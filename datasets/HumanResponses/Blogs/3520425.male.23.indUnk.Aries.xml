      Yoz~ Super sleepy(when am i not??? *shrugs*)  Finished watching Charmed on Starworld...currently showing the practice... SLOW~~~~~ There is a new show coming to Starworld...at least i think it is new.. Boston Public... Looks good~ About teachers.... The office is on Central on thursdays... Boy am i turing this blog into a tv guide...   *yawnz* managed to finish another chapter of finance tonite. Good~! but not good enough~ Should start on retailing soon...since retail paper is on mon and finance on wed. Argh~ Part of me wanns this to end soon. But i will be leaving for aussie soon after my exams... So much uncertainty~  Took some pics with the new fuji last nite while waiting for my parents... These were taken from my garden while i am sitting in the car(windows opened of coz).....     Notice how fast the sky changes... these pics are taken barely seconds apart (    I've named this the "Devil's Nostrils" - Be abit imaginative please~     Took many pictures cause my parents told me to get changed without showering as we were in a hurry... BUT~! they came down like 20 mins later...freshly showered...argh~ kena cheated again~  Went to uncle's shop to buy more fishes and plants for my fish tank~ Looks so much better now....      Some of u might be wondering what the hell my title means~ Well my aunt brought me chicken rice for lunch today (she knows that i skip meals whenever my parents are not around)... I was amazed by how well packaged chicken rice are nowadays. Hence the 8th 'P'... Take a look....    I think the bag looks nice(my fave colour is blue)...however, the colour reminds me of another entity~ Singapore Casket~ *double shrug*  Doesn't it remind u of a 'bento'?? It even includes a nicely pre-packed chilli...    Slurp~

      Yoz~ Playing with the cam...Uncle Chin playing with his camera~ The flash is killing my eyes~ Though we both feel like celebrities on the red carpet. *Waves*  Went Waraku and Robinsons Sale again today~ Below are some pics from our outing today...(Pictures are not very clear cause we forgot to bring the camera and used my PDA instead)  Mr Chin's paper steamboat~    Nora with her Kimuchi-Nabe soup~    My Beef Yaganawa set~    Our fave cheese with potato (super tasty..although it looks like puke here)~     Part 2....SHOPPING~ We looked all sorts of nonsense...bedsheets...household..clothes..underwear..toiletries..  Both Nora and myself set our eyes upon this nice jacket...but we never buy lah.. $179 leh    Mr Chin with his Thinsulate snow cap *Super Cute*~    Psst: There is also a picture of Nora in a super 'tai-tai' coat...something that makes her look like Glenn Close in 101 Dalmatians~ But in order not to scare everyone.. the picture is hereby *censored*... However, I may consider posting it if there are more than 5 requests. (Please post your requests on the comments page).  After about 2 hours of hardcore shoppin~ We went to Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf... Nora wanted to eat her Chicago Cheesecake~...Me and Chin has Ice-Blended~ Well dun ask me for the pics as we were already too tired to play with any gadgets~  Gotta go....Ch 8 playing some horror flick~

      Aircon on @ 22 degrees and uncle chin is trying to act innocent about it (stupid cold blooded creature trying to freeze me to death~!). Luckily am wearing my new pyjamas from Robinsons~ Quite cheap $29.90 per set. Am trying to get uncle to get one set too. Then we can be  urlLink Bananas In Pyjamas ~...      SCARY~!   Uncle Chin took this picture for me on our way down to collect the pizza~!    *SINGS* Banana in pyjamas are  clowning  down the stairs......   Today is quite a fruitful day~ Went to RELC to get my Letter of Offer~ Bloody idiots~ Cannot find my letter. Said would call me later in the afternoon but NEVER~ If he never get back to me by tomolo ah... He will get it from me~  After storming out of RELC was late lunch @  ~~ Woo hoo~ Uncle Chin had a kid's Tomato Paste Spaghetti and some fries... Of coz I had my favourite meaty-bolas    Bought some photo frames. Those 3 for $1.90 ones... damn happening~ All  urlLink bettaspeak 's fault. She intro-ed me to printing photos @ home. And I am now super-addicted liao... Bought 12 frames juz to put pics and give ppl.... Siao Liao... By the way, if you wanna read  urlLink bettaspeak 's blog, dun bother~! She forgot her password and the email she registered the account with. So she can't post anything. If anyone has any cures for stupidity, please let me know and I shall be kind enough to forward them to her. *Amitabha*   Oh yes...bought a nice plant from Ikea too. Quite cheap also--$5.90 Dunno how long they will last before they mati. But at least they managed to leave the car alive. With this I must narrate a story that happened to someone close to me. Bought plants, left in car, 'chao-tah'...PERIOD~ Dun need to mention names...we all know who~ *points finger*    Next stop~ Robinsons department store~  Wanted to buy quilt and sheets to bring to Aussie~ But Robinsons members got additional 5% rebate. So wait for mama to come home then buy. But we still bought other stuff lah~ Bought a set of pyjamas (see above), a V-neck 100%lambswool sweater (was $99 now $29).. a pair of chinos pants ($13)... I love the Great Singapore Sale~  Dinner @ Sento... Eh no~ the changed their name to WARAKU~ Pui...awful name... But food is still as nice....Had out usual Cheese with roe and potato~, cutlet set, kimchi nabe~ Sorry the pics not very clear cause taken using my samsung~(the camera's in the car and both of us too lazy to walk).      Kimchi Nabe is Super Shiok~ (Ps: one ah beng sitting behind uncle chin was overheard telling the ah lian girlfriend... "Oei, we order one Kani-Nabe to try...) I almost choked.   Alamak...This post is getting too long...still got alot to talk. But maybe will leave it till next time cause is 0043 now and uncle wanns to sleep. And for your information, my blog is not just about food~ It includes shopping too ~ *Wink*  Nitez...

      *Burp* *Burp* *Burp*  This is all due to the above mentioned food. Forgot to take pics of my famous baked potatoes before I finished them. Too bad.... ~! As for the Dove chocolates, blame Nora. She gave them to me. *points finger* This woman must be enjoying herself in Bali~ *grrr*  Found this picture sitting in my hard-disk. Added abit of sepia effect to it. Was originally black and white though. Taken when Nora first bought her Fuji... It was taken at my uncle's house...On his couch...super hiao trio~ wad more can i say~      It was a super wet day. Went Harbourfront for pasta (Carbonara with X-tra cheese) before going to NUS to HSS Library.. Nora lah~ machiam going to Bali without me is not evil enough. Still make us go to HSS borrow books for her... Somemore must cart to the photocopying shop. (I won't say which one, scar-li the publishers are reading) Then went facial with Uncle Chin then dinner wif papa then home...then supper... Again NO WORK DONE~ JIA LAT~  Oh... found another pic taken during BIG WALK 2004...     Uncle Chin looks so much like the last emperor~ PU YI~ *Ryuichi Sakamoto's music playing in the backgroud* and he even has two chamber-maids by his side. But the auntie on the left machiam look lost... suggest she dun wake up so early the next time...somemore never wear uniform~ No wonder never win car... But remember our date. We are joining the competitive walkers next year. Yoo Hoo.... Dream car here we come~ Hopefully next year's first prize is a mini then maybe uncle jason will be more motivated to join~      Oops...uncle chin sleep liao...with his specs on and a book in his hand.... he wanna read in his dreams i think.... better go off  and try to sleep before he starts snoring. Once he starts... i can say bye bye to any beauty sleep. Yes~! Beauty sleep. Facial auntie say...must sleep well then can be beautiful.

      Oh Yes~! Or rather ...OH NO~! After a week long of my so-called DIET plan.. ________ (Fill in the blanks yourselves) I dun have to say much. I'm sure everyone knows me well enough by now... I had my fave burger (refer to title above)... Although I had to wait for them to deliver it to me. I did not complain as nuthing beats a hot, fresh-from-the-wherever B&T. It was so good that i totally forgot wat i was there for in the first place... I was supposed to be studying for my final exams. Well as i would usually say... there always tomorrow...hahaha  OMG~ This looks so good i am hungry again.... Uncle Jason: Psst~! Changed your mind yet?    Just when i was pledging my loyalty to BK's mushroom swiss when Mac introduces the B&T~ Of course they must pay much $$ to uncle Jason... He was the one who kinda like talked me into eating the B&T and i was hooked...grr grr... He is partly responsible for my swelling stomach *lol*...  Oh ya...miss nora was almost responsible for my big tummy... If not for the fact that these stuff are $12.80 per box... Cut-throat i say~     *BURP*

      Super F^&*ed-up.. Was reading my enrolment thingy and realised that I need to bring my letter of offer to Perth with me. And the thing is i think i have submitted it when i paid for my sch fees to the Singapore agent. Emailed them but no reply~ SCREW them~  Enough of crap.. It's good to see that our virtual community has expanded by 200%..to 3 person. Dat's a good start. Please spread the word. We aim to reach our 1st million hits by end of 2004 (although i dun think anyne would be interested). But anything is possible when you believe~      Have you ever reached your rainbows end Did you find your pot of gold Ever catch a shooting star Tell me how high did you soar Ever felt like you were dreaming just to find that you’re awake And the magic that surrouds you can lift you up and guide you on your way  I can see it in the stars across the sky Dreamed a hundred thousand dreams before, Now I finally realize You see I’ve waited all my life For this moment to arrive And finally I believe in the impossible  If I reach deep within my heart Overcome any obstacles Won’t let this dream fall apart You see I strive to be the very best Shine my light for all to see Cause anything is possible When you believe  I can see it in the stars across the sky (Yeah) Dreamed a hundred thousand dreams before Now I finally realize (Now I finally realize) You see I’ve waited all my life For this moment to arrive Finally, finally I believe  I said I believe (ohh yeah) Love keeps lifting me higher (Love keeps lifting me higher) Love keeps lifting me higher (You ought to try it for yourself) (Lifting me higher) Love keeps lifting me higher (Yeah.. Love keeps lifting me higher) Love keeps lifting me higher (Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher) Love keeps lifting me higher (Love keeps lifting, love keeps lifting me higher) Love keeps lifting me higher Yeah..  Higher Oh yeah..     Super inspiring song by a super inspiring person~

      Juz when i tot there are no more movies that i wanna watch around and i can finally settle down and mug for my final exams...    Looks like a crappy show...but have alwayz been a sucker for special effects~ Maybe i should join this contest rather than having to fork out $8.50 for less then 2 hours of fun~   urlLink      Finally submitted my project today. Which mean i do not have anymore proj for this term~ Phew... But final exams 2 weeks away and i haven started studying yet...spent too much time televisioning and projecting~ (not a good excuse i know)  Bought this remixed Shanghai Diva cd... quite cool but some tracks sound weird...maybe because i am too used to the old style...maybe i'm just old... but i onli paid $6 for it so no complains... I love chinatown cd shops.  Looking at mac website (the burger place...not the comp)...B&T.... best thing that my uncle ever intro-ed to me... Hungry... Cheezels, Baos, Swiss Rolls or Mac? Cannot decide.   Another day gone... F&*^~!

      Watching news on channel 8 and surfing the net at the same time. Came across this super cute picture.... enjoy    News reporting Bits N Pieces on Singapore Idol (*pui*)... they showed 3 contestants preparing for the audition... funny thing is one is butch...one who looks less straight than k.d lang and finally one of the drag queens i've seen somewhere but forgot where (p/s dun freak out~! he is not in drag on tv).... SCARY~!! Think they should rename the show to Mardi Gras on 5...

      For those who doesn't understand what the title means, dun worry coz.. its better not to know. Juz finished the second part of my project. Yawnz.. 2 peanut pancakes and a diet coke @ 9 and i am still hungry....wad a pig~ Must tahan....cannot eat anymore. Warned by doctor then i may be overweight soon. Or am already overweight... since the last time i saw him was months back.  Re-watched american idol on ch5 juz now. Amazing how much i enjoyed myself even though results are already known. We r all suckers for the show~ Chain Chain Chain~ Chain of FOOLS~ Enjoyed the show but kinda felt guilty at the end for neglecting my supposed priority--my project. I was only after the show when i found out i was still at the same paragraph since 11~ and my room is in its messiest state~ Double F^&#.... Heres a pic of the state of my room after 2 projects~     And not fogetting~ my fave OSK green tea~     Currently channel surfing~ Anyone knows how many channels does SCV has? How come i can't find one that's interesting enough for me~ Ended up watching retro MTV from the eighties.. Not very interesting ...but entertaining...(laughable)... Channel 8 playing some B grade...no no...make it D grade movie... Some murder thriller.. Linda Wong~ haha.. how can we forget her... the woman who told the whole world she was in the 20s when she was actually 47~   Can't discribe how excited i am about tomolo nite's movie session~ yes~! the wait is finally over. The prisoner of the askaban is here~ My fave book from the series. For those who haven read or have already read but forgotton 99% of the book(u know who u are *wink*) i shall not spoil your fun by giving my full thesis on book 3 here. Watch the movie yourself and if possible...read the books....there are more interesting details in every book as compared to the movies. You'll find more stuff everytime u read. DO NOT ask me how many times i have studied the books and watched the movies.. It'll scare you~ Promise~!

      Went to the concert half expecting her to sing badly~ She kinda lost her crystal clear voice after childbirth~ Maybe the cigarettes are responsible~ I dunno~ But the concert was fab. She managed to do all her vocal somersaults for her difficult songs although they seemed less effortless then before... In the past, she used to breeze through her singing but last nite, she looked super-strained...... Luckily i quit smoking~     Woke up @ 11 this morning... Super good sleep~ Although my eye is still swollen...In fact it has gotten bigger. But i feel so much better. Super good sleep~ haven got such a good sleep for a long long long long long time.  Went Heartland Mall got some groceries (i.e. Diet Coke supply) and charsiew rice plus some chinese peanut pancake..... Burp~  Argh~ Project due on th 8th~ F#&*~!!!! Then again~ A man have to rest~ Time for nap~ I know it is super unhealthy and fattening to sleep right after a meal~ BUT WHO CARES~!  *SNOOZE MODE*

      First day posting here~ Wonder if i will ever share this blog with others.  Came across many blogs done up by frenz. Some are really impressive~ Some are mediocre~ But one thing in common~ Lots of them like to use flowery sentences and big words that u dun usually here in real life conversations.... INTERESTING~ But u can never see them on my blog.... Cause I dunno how to speak like that, not even to mention write.  2nd of June, important day on the calendar of 2004... One of my frenz taking over a printing shop today. But more importantly, Madam Faye Wong, my idol from my childhood/teenage days will perform here at the Singapore Indoor Stadium tonite and this will be the first time i'll watch her concert live. Met her in person a couple of times before but never attended her concert. Some kind of fan~!   Juz chatted with a fren on MSN. He said he too will be going for the concert and will be fully equipped with light sticks and whistle~ Gawd~ Am I getting old or what?  To contradict my point of feeling old, I am currently at Chapter 4 of the 2nd book of the Artemis Fowl series.... The Artic Incident~ Was introduced to this series after overdosing myself on Harry Potter books and DVDs~! Oh BTW will be watching the third installment at Lido this fri... Artemis Fowl proves to be harder reading than the whole Harry Potter series combined. Much concentration is needed or I'll have to re-read the whole page. This tells u alot about the standard of my english~  Nap Time~   ******* To be continued********

      Well.. School started since monday... thurs and fris are most most relaxed days~ Phew~ There's alot of differences between studying here and in Singapore~ No doubt it's the same degree offered by the same school, there are NO homeowkr back in SG~!!!There are much tutorial homework here...Argh~   Geez~! It's raining again~ The winter is cold enough minus the rain and the cold is sufficient to dampan anyone's spirits and the rain makes it even wetter~ Luckily I have my Ipod with me~~ *Tang Na is currently screaming in the backgroud*  I must complain once again~ Not only the food is expensive here, they taste awful~ Even the lousiest coffee shop stall in singapore serves better food~   *Switched to Stephanie Sun's YU JIAN now~*  Oh ya... bought 3 school textbooks yesterday for like au$200 plus... supposed to buy one more but my china classmate says she'd lend me hers... (hers is currently out in the open sea, wonder when it'll reach).. I would have bought the book without waiting for hers if not for the fact that that bloody black n white textbook costs au$100 here~   Oh yah.. for those techno savvy ppl out there... 3G fone is huge in aussie (wonder why singapore hasn't caught up with it... hello Lee Hsien Yang~??) I bought one for myself... one so big that i laughed at myself for buying it... U can look at it  urlLink here .  There are smaller versions.. But the LG one looks too much like my Samsung~ So since i wanna get a 3g fone. I think i should get one with thousand n one functions. Juz dun answer the fone without my bluetooth earpiece. I will look awfully stupid. Trust me~! It's Huge~ but super big screen~  Uncle Chin said I bought it on impulse.. Maybe he is rite~ I dunno & I DUN CARE~ It's so boring here~ Woke up @ 0730 today...went for tut till about 10 then came home...slept till about 2.. did some research then cooked instant noodies.. it's 5 now.. but i swear it looks like 7 in singapore!~ gloomy weather...   watching the cars go by... stoning in my room (with heater on)~ safe from the cold.. no pictures to post lately.. mainly becoz i alwayz forget to bring me camera out~ but will try to take more picture this weekend (dat's if i get to go out)~    Lastly... to all the Harry Potter fans out there. I think this  urlLink video clip  might interest u. It's definately worth the watch.. If the link is down~ please email me... I will send the video to u.   Miss ya all~  K.H.
