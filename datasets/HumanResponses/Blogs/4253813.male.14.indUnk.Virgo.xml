      yea, i had to come back, i think that i should actualy try to get all this down, maybe i can think through all this...anywayz, everyone has this different opinions about love and their "perfect someone" but like many people before me have said, is there such a thing as a perfect someone? or is it just a thing of hope spread around untill someone gets that its not true? this isnt working, i still cant think.  holy shiz! why is this so hard!?!?!? why cant i handle this? after everything. ok, let me try again. ok, i just got done talkin to bek about me and jo, after everything we have been through, she still sayz that there is something between us. and i just dont kno, i mean, i think everyone already knows it, but yea, i still have feelings for jo, and idk if she still has those feelings for me, but there has alwayz been more hope in me for us. i really dont care what anyone is saying about me as they read this, this is how i feel and i think its about damn time for things to change with me. but anywayz, jo, i kno u kno about my feelings for you, and i kno we have already talked about everything already...but i just really need to kno if there is anything between us still. i mean, a tru for real no messing around, no beating around the bush truth. rite now i cant care about the bad that might happen, i mean, after all the convos we have gotten through and we can still have dayz like saturday...i dont think the bad can be 2 bad, and if u dont wanna reply, just tell me...well, g2g, seyaz everyone!

          yup, like the title said, its  2 in day morning. And IM talking to rida and Scott on-line. But rida's computer is being lame as hell and keeps kicking her off.    so how about that....Well, yea, I got to wait till 3:45 then I have to get off-line and pretend to be asleep while my mom gets up and showers and all that stuff...I hope she has to work tomorrow, because IM having rida and lauryn and Kyle come ova in the morning. rida and lauryn because they going to stay up all night because they hyper as hell...And Kyle because we going to walk to school together. How pleasant....I wonder if rida and lauryn going to walk with me and Kyle...That would be fun...O-well. Damn, school has been mucho fun so far, but IM not going to bore u about all that like I have already bored u with all of this so far....Well, I should go...seyaz!
