      In case you have been living under a rock recently Apple's WWDC (World Wide Developers Conference) is starting tommorrow June 28, 2004.  Steve Jobs is planned to preview the newest version of OSX, Tiger.    It is also  urlLink rumored  that he will upgrade the LCD displays. If we are lucky we may see a G5 in an iMac or PowerBook.  We can only hope...  UPDATE:  The  urlLink new displays  are here.  The 20, 23 and 30 in!!!! And yes you can connect two 30" displays together for a grand total of 8 million pixcels!!  Also many new and cool features of  urlLink Tiger  were shown in the  urlLink keynote .  +MacMan

      Check out the new links I added on the right.  If you have a link that you think I should add leave a comment.  More links to follow.  +MacMan  UPDATE:    For everyone who is still interested in a Gmail account check out the Gmail Machine link on the right.  The Gmail machine is like a Gmail lottery.  The machine randomly generates a number every time you click the refresh button.  The object is to "hit" the number 1337.  If you are lucky enough to do this you will recieve a brand new never been used Gmail invite.  Props to Scott and Kevin for the great idea.  -MacMan

      Apple recently released a new product to its line of wireless accessories.   urlLink AirPort Express  is a great looking product.  It allows you to stream your entire iTunes collection to your stereo system.  Also you can use it to expand your already existing wireless network or use it as a wireless bridge.  The coolest feature of the AirPort Express is its ability to connect a printer to your network via USB.  Now thats cool!  Hopefully i can get my hands on one to test soon.    -MacMan

           "You are eternity's hostage  A captive of time."                           - Boris Pasternak    Hi all, it is good to be here on MacSpot. Even though MacSpot isn't know to the masses yet, hopefully this will change in time. I would first like to ask all the readers of this blog if we should keep the Linux News and McAfee virus box-linky things? They seem to clutter things and add extra load time for the blog, but if you, the people who come here, want to keep them and find them useful we obviously will keep them. Just comment and let us konw what you think. Later    ConMan

      Have you ever wondered if you could acutally run an OS from your iPod hard drive.  Well, now you can.       urlLink Linux for the iPod  is a very cool thing.  One of its purposes is to allow the iPod to play a variety of other music formats such as Ogg Vorbis.    You might ask    What applications can it run?     In theory most applications that run on uClinux can run on the iPod however there are important limitations;        The iPod does not have a FPU (floating point unit) so things like mpg123 won't run too nicely. Integer based versions of MP3 players however are available and will run.   The frame buffer does not support  mmap()  so X11 would not run.   Since we are running on uClinux the  fork()  system call is not supported ( vfork()  however is available).        A few good things about Linux on the iPod is that you will not lose any data on the iPod should you choose to install Linux. Also it has a built in boot loader which will allow you to choose between Linux and Apple's Firmware after you reset the iPod.   You should be able to run this on all iPods except the mini and G4.  (This may only be temporary.)     Be sure to read the  urlLink FAQ  to get general knowledge and help.     In reality Linux on your iPod doesn't improve its functionality too much, but it sure is cool...     +MacMan

      Have you ever wished that you could find a website that would find all the best tech deals on the internet and gather them into one place? Well, I've found it.     urlLink Ben's Bargain Center     This site is GREAT!  I've found some super deals on here.    example: urlLink IBM/Hitachi 200GB 8MB Hard Drive $160 - $80 rebates = $80  urlLink        Ben's Bargain Center does not make the deals, they just search the web and post the best from other companies.    One of my favorite parts of the site is the freebies section. In this section there are all sorts of deals and products that you can get for free. You can get free shirts and magazines. Sometimes a really good one will come along like this.      urlLink Free Windows XP Professional from Windows Mobile Training         Deals like the one above are taken quickly so you have to be on your toes to get them.    Ben's deals are ever changing. Through out the day new deals will show up on the site. Today over 100 deals were placed on the site, and many more will be added tommorow.    However the best thing about Ben's is their slogan:    "Where ghetto dogs go for the  lowdown  on deals."    Some other places for finding low prices online are :   urlLink Got Apex?    urlLink Price Watch    urlLink Mwave      urlLink    If anyone else has another good deal site feel free to post.    +MacMan   urlLink

       Many people that I know always complain to me that they recieve a ton of pop-ups and their computer is painfully slow. Most of the time I diagnose the problem as some sort of   spyware   or malware has been installed on the computer.  Some very common and nasty spyware programs are   Gator  ,   Weather Bug  , and   Bonzi Buddy  .      The steps to remove spyware are very easy. First you need to download some free utilities. Many companies will try to sell you software to remove spyware. Don't buy them. The programs below work a lot better and are FREE.      Spybot Search & Destroy    This is a Great Program.  When you first start it up be sure to check for updates and imunize your system.        AdAware    This program is also good.  Make sure to check for updates.      Another problem that people have is browser hijacks. If you have ever had you homepage changed without you changing it yourself, you have probably been hijacked. To remove these hijacks use the program CW Shredder.      CW Shredder    This program runs very fast so run it often!

       urlLink Apple  has done it.  As rummored they have released the  urlLink new 4G iPods .  They look similar to the  urlLink iPod minis  but have the storage capacity and overall size as the 3g iPods.  If you already own a 3G iPod dont run out and buy one of these.  Your iPod is basically the same.  However, if you are running an older iPod or are new to the iPod community, you should definately take a look at the 4G models.  The price per GB is now lowered:  20GB costs $299 $14.95 per GB  40GB costs $399 $9.975 per GB  This is a great deal compared to the 3G iPods.  If you dont want to spend the money for the latest and greatest check out  urlLink Amazon  and pick up a  urlLink 3G 15GB iPod for $249 .  Be sure to add a  urlLink filler  item  item to be qualified for a $50 off you next purchase coupon.  A filler is an item that will "fill" the price so it will hit the $250 mark.  This is a great deal so jump on it while it still lasts.  -MacMan

      Sure the  urlLink new iPods  line is great, but wouldn't it be better if you could get a 20GB iPod for $299 or a 40GB iPod for $399.  That would be great.  Also the  urlLink new iPods  will sport a new look similar to the iPod minis with embedded buttons in the scroll wheel.  These new 4TH generation iPods will have an even better set of menus and allow users to have more than one "on-the-go playlist".  Keep reading for more udpates.  +MacMan

      I found this story on  urlLink Kevin Rose's Blog .  You can get a really cool Linux deal for free.  Novell will give you:                      - SUSE LINUX Standard Server 8.0 (ISO Installation Images)                     - SUSE LINUX 9.1 Professional (Bootable Installation DVD)                     - Ximian Desktop 2.0 Evaluation (ISO Image)                     - Ximian Red Carpet 2.0.2 Evaluation (ISO Image)                     - Novell Linux Services 1.0 (ISO Image & NLS Companion CD)                     - Novell GroupWise for Linux 6.5.1 - Server, Client & Messenger                     - and more...

      Hey again, Sorry I haven't been posting very often. My schedule just got tighter with school starting. I should have a new post comming up soon talking about using the Ken Burn's Effect in iMovie to make still pictures come to life. Keep an eye out for that.  I also want to welcome the new readers of MacSpot. I noticed that the counter has been busy lately and I love to see it. If you have any questions/comments feel free to post or email me at  macspot@gmail.com  Because I don' t want this post to go completly tech free get this. I just bought a new Sandisk Cruzer Mini 256mb for $35 (After $10 mail-in rebate and some instant savings) at CompUSA. I love it. ConMan has had one for a while and he loves his too. It is very handy and also looks a lot better than most of the other thumbdrives on the market. If you need or want a thumbdrive check out this one.  Also check out the new FireFox link on the side. If you don't already run FireFox or another form of Mozilla I strongly encourage you to switch. Why not, its free?  +MacMan

      "The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science"                         - Einstein  Doom 3 officially came out Aug. 4 for the PC and I of course rushed off to Best Buy after work to try and buy a copy. I was successful but it wasn't until today that I got a chance to play. The visuals in this game are amazing, easy the best I've seen. The music is awesome as well. Seems there are fewer weapons compared to games like UT 2k4 and I was alittle disappointed in the few types of multiplayer games (no CTF). I thought about what game to compare it to, to help describe it to a friend but I couldn't. It really isn't like CounterStrike, UT, FarCry, or Halo. It is an awesome game but so far (I am still in the beginning) it is pretty much going down one-way corridors and shooting stuff. I don't feel the skill demands compared to some of the above listed games. But still a great game, I suggest everyone buying it to try or playing on a friends or something. I paid $55 for mine, which is alittle high, so I suggest if you don't want to pay this just wait for it to go down.  On a more mac note, Doom 3 is being developed or converted for both the Mac and Linux but I haven't heard anything about when. Id Software seems to want to do a good job so isn't rushing this. It should also be out or coming out for the Xbox, I think.

      WOW!!! I just finished playing a really fun game called  urlLink Peasant's Quest . This game is great because it is not your average run-of-the-mill game. It is text-based with a graphical interface. To play the game you use commands such as get, ask, talk, use, and give. The object of the game is to kill Trogdor the dragon because he has burninated your cottage.  The game was made by Videletrix for  urlLink HomeStarRunner .  Homestar is a flash animation  site.  It is my favorite!  The best part of the site are the  urlLink Strong Bad Emails .(Strong Bad is a character on the site). Be sure to watch some emails before you play the game. This will give you a taste of what the site is like so you will enjoy the game that much more.   BE SURE TO WATCH THE EMAIL CALLED  urlLink DRAGON !  IT WILL MAKE THE GAME MAKE MORE SENSE!   Have fun playing this throw back game. Remember things aren't always as they appear. If you need help with the game or just have a general question leave a comment and I'll help you.  HINT:  Try typing the word die in a non-critical part of the game.  HINT2: If you REALLY need help check out this   walkthrough  .   Happy Dragon Slaying +Matt
