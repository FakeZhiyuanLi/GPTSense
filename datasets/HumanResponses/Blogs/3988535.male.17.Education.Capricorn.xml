      Man like 90% of the people in my school are cheating on their english assesments... its so easy to, and im tempted to myself, coz id rather have a quality essay as opposed to sitting there trying to remembering it and missing out on key points !   That aside, i got a haircut, wootemz. Um nothing really change my wallpaper, and from sonique to winamp O.o how boring!   Damnit i only got 5 weeks to go and smoke my pipe up her tree.. i mean ask her out ...   Im not like that okay>! i was just kidding :)   Oh well 5 more weeks.. PLENTY of time..

      Again!?! man school sucks   Oh well, so i have like 5 major assesment tasks this week, one being SUPER important tomorrow, and its 8 so i have like 2 hours... yet i dont know what in gods name its talking about so im screwed, and my group memebers are homo and cant freakin answer simple questions!!!   WTF!??!   Oh and i saw the 'other' her today... like we were staring at eachother, she was in the car passing and i was at the bus stop... and im like thats not her... cant be... wtf it is her??? and i didnt wave.. haha oh well i guess i can bring it up with her at school and turn it into something swanky if it was or was not her...   Like 'Hey did i see you yesterday?? Oh not you huh? Coz i saw this damned beautiful girl in a white 4wheel and i could have sworn it was you!"   OR   "Hey did i see you yesterday?? Oh man i thought so! But then again i thought i was seeing things, and would have looked like a knob if it wasnt you"   Okay so.. if it wasnt her it will work better but anyways IM SCREWED BACK TO BEING SCREWED
