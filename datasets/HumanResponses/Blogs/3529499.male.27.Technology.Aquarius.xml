      So I get a phone call, asking for me by name, on my line which is:  1. Unlisted 2. In my mother's name 3. NEVER given out to any companies/agencies  and the caller claims to be representing Maxim Magazine. When I asked where she got my number, she answered "Maxim Magazine". Knowing that Maxim does not have my phone number, I again inquired where they got my numbed and her reply was again "Maxim Magazine"...  After telling her that I did NOT receive maxim AT THAT NUMBER she hung up.  Now, I dialed star[*] 69 and got the number  800-362-0796 ... I've been trying to research that number but with no luck. So far, it will cost me between $60 and $250 just to find out who owns the number.  $250  to find out who called  MY  phone.  I call out to the masses. If anybody has access to this information would you please email me any information you have. I dunno, maybe someone in your family is in law enforcement or is a private investigator? I could use a hand...

      Some things just don't stick in your mind. No matter how many times you try to remember. I just saw Collateral tonight. I tend to forget the name of this movie EVERY time I tell someone about it. "I just saw... that movie with Tom Cruise." is all that comes out! Even in this post, I had to go back and fill in the name.  The movie was pretty good, though I missed the ending. I figured that I had time to run to the bathroom and get back before the climactic moment, but as I returned, the action had ceased and the movie ended. It did have some great moments and lots of action. I enjoyed it and as soon as a bootleg becomes available, I'm catching the ending!

      I never did get to meet Patti today. Last minute, she backed out claiming to need to babysit. Around 3:00 PM, we planned to get together around 6:00 PM. I called her at 5:00 PM to get directions and arrange where we would meet and she suddenly had something else to do.  This is not the first time recently I have been cancelled on last minute. One day I will find someone who isn't this flaky. It's a shame that there's so many people like this out there.

      I'm back up an running! The new remote control (UCR-6131 by OneForAll) kicks ass. It was completely programmable for all the devices on my home theatre:   - My Sony Surround Sound Reciever  - My Sony TiVo  - My Phillips DVD-Recorder  - My Sony iO Cable Box  plus it has the capability of reassigning keys between different devices, so while set for TiVo, I can control the power to the surround sound reciever as well as the volume controls (Even better than I could on the real TiVo remote)  I also have the capability to add any 2 additional devices (TV and VCR). The buttons can be cross programmed as well, so the TV button can actually work any type of device (PVR, DVD, VCR, AUD, CBL, etc..)  Not bad for $20!

      As stated last night, I found that Best Buy carries the universal remote that can control my TiVo as well as (hopefully) everything else in my room.  I'll head out in a bit to take care of that and then I need to pick up a belated birthday present for my friend Jen. Her birthday was the other day and I havent had a chance to get her anything. I feel like such an ass, as I consider her to be a really good friend.  After all that I might be meeting someone new. This girl, Patti, that I met through my other blog at LiveJournal.com. She seems like a cool and interesting person, so I am looking foward to meeting her.

      I'm a little bothered by the events of the past few days. All I remember is that I was sitting at my desk, installing Windows XP on my desktop and surfing channels and watching saved episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space 9 (DS9) on my TiVo.  Then all of a sudden it was gone. Since then, I have not been able to locate my TiVo remote control. It has completely vanished into thin air. I've cleaned about 75% of my room (and those of you who have had the honor of seeing my room, know that that's not an easy task!) and it's still nowhere to be found....  After calling PC Richards and Circuit City and about 10 minutes of searching I finally found a universal remote on Yahoo! Stores that works with TiVo. So of course I ordered it for $14 plus $11 s/h (outrageous!) Then I proceed Besy Buy's site to find they carry the same remote for only $19... and I can pick it up tomorrow...  Well, I called and emailed the Yahoo! Store and told them to cancel the order. We'll see what happens.

      I typically post to LiveJournal, but I figured I'd give Blogger a chance seeing it is such a popular blog engine... Who knows. Maybe I'll like this one better and switch over to here. I'll try to keep the posts as interesting as possible. Then again, if my life were that interesting, I'd be a writer and not a Support Technician :)
