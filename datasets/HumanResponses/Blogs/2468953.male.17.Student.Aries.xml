      That night, 3th of July, My friend KhoBo open his birthday party at his friends house. We are so happy to be there. Everybody love him, because he is such a cute, stim and funny boy. He love to laugh, really...  Boys and girls, we all attend on 8 something. We get ready for his present and food, and parties!!! Some of our friend drove his mother's Kompressor to take us around. It's really cool! It's my first time to seat on an "open roof" Benz. We go around to Dato Kramat, to be seen by other :| After that we back to the party again. and bla bla bla...  On about 1 am in the morning, just playing card and talking about all crap. So come the police - he said that we are too loud and the neighbour are complainning us. Nothing to do, our IC are checked by the police, and he tell us to go back. What a party... We are all shocked because some of us are the first time for this situation. We must follow his instruction or we are in lock-up. I think it excite, and maybe this is a BIG present for KhoBo.

      I can heard the war out there. Spending so much money, life, weapon, relationship on war. Why don't they spend the money on reaseraching new thing? Why make nuclear weapon program? They are the leader, but they didn't did thier jobs. But they did nothing benefits to human being. Killing all those man, children. Make them suffer, thier family crying...   urlLink

      Walking down the street, there are some guy who are wearing all white uniform and black long pants, black shoes. Girls and boys, holding a metal made container, and label "St. John Malaysia". Anxiety to finding some one to donate into their box.  &nbsp;  I'm a St. John member when I was form 2. I got that experience about flag day. First of all, we got a briefing on St. John headquarters on 5.30am in the young morning. Our commander will separate us to different places for donation. Some like market, shopping mall, or residents. One thing my commander told us that I'll never&nbsp;forget is "Don't come back if your box are not 3 quarter full, or you will be punished!". That was my first time to flag day, I don't even know what is 3 quarter. :-  &nbsp;  So I&nbsp;go together with&nbsp;my best friend, Edwin, had gone to the morning market for donation. You can see how now a days human react. Some of them donate happily, but some of them get&nbsp;mad when they saw you come across.  &nbsp;  Today, I've seen a St. John member come forward, and tell me&nbsp;to donate. Sure, I will. Because I experience it! So don't you&nbsp;felt frustrate to&nbsp;them!  &nbsp;    urlLink St John Ambulance Australia  is a self-funding charitable organisation, active in all States and Territories, dedicated to helping people in sickness, distress, suffering or danger.

      Today, 17 July. Is our school band AGM. I'm form 5 now. It's the last year I'm gonna stay at this school, I had join this band since form 3, I'm the percussion leader since last year, so today is the deadline of my job. Because I really miss my post, so I felt some sad to give out my jobs. But, still I'm happy to see my junior who are going to replace my post.  &nbsp;  We taking picture in the morning, for our memory. The meeting start with our conductor Mr. Woon, and ended by our former president. Two leader are chosen for our section, because percussion section seems to be hard to maintain. I hope my junior are doing well soon.  &nbsp;  We have lunch all together on restaurant... After that, I back to school band room again, and play the drum alone...

      It was amazing,&nbsp;my friends told me to&nbsp;join the band&nbsp;become&nbsp;drummer for a small&nbsp;show, our school&nbsp;Wireless club anniversary , they want us to perform a few songs and make some interesting atmospheres. Once we knew, we prepare everything, we practice the song over hundred of time, we sacrifice our time, and every thing else we could. Our bass guitarist, guitarist, and keyboard all are looking for that day. Although it's my first time to make a "small" show together with my friends, so I t's quite nervous and excited to me.   The day has come, we got a rehearsal, make sure everything going well. On the time we going to the stage, the wireless club&nbsp;member told us the amplifier device are too far from the stage, and the wire are too short to make a way to the stage. Time is&nbsp;rush, so we can't start without the tools. We were frustrated and our dreams are gone. It's my first time for the show, but it couldn't succeed. We just cancel the whole thing and back to home.&nbsp;
