      I still am confused and don't know what to do. I don't know what to think anymore. And it seems like almost EVERY time I turn on the radio or changee the station, The Reason seems to come on. It scares me, It's either that or a song that reminds me of him. I miss him. and It's sad because I keep wondering to myself am I supposed to miss him this much? Does he miss me, is he thinking about me? These thoughts seem to consume my mind and I wish they didn't because whatever I think and feel is usually the complete opposite of what is real. I have to wonder how he can say such amazing things to me and be with her(which I think he is, and most likely is) And if he and I are just friends and that's it hwo can he say those things when he knows that I know how they're going to affect me. He said that he felt something between us, again I'm repeating myself, but just make sure that I heard myself the first time. Is what I'm thinking all in my head? That he's with her and he and I could never be. He said he wants a long term relationship, so what was I, a "fling" of some sort? That's what I want more than anything. To be with somebody. And I don't mean like hey the first guy that I see I want to be like I want to be in the big extravagant reltionship with. There was a point in time where I could have seen myself with Nate. And then I actaully thought about it and I realized What the hell was I thinking? Nate could never commit to a girl. Speaking of Nate, he called me last night at god damned 230 in the morning, I was like Oh my God you have to be kidding me! but anyways on with my bitching....Am I obsessing over this or am I the most parinoid person on the planet? I want to be with Brent, and I know that. But the whole one sided and other girl thing is kind of a problem, yeahhhh. I have to wonder sometimes if he takes me seriously. i think he thinks I'm this huge flirt and can't be with one guy, so the female version of Nate. Which completely isn't true. I know that Brent and I aren't tgether, but Nate came over one night a few nights ago and we kissed and I felt guilty, and I don't know why. I felt like I was cheating on Brent because the whole time that Nate and I were sitting outside that's all I kept thinking about, and this was before he left for Germany. What the hell is wrong with me. WHY AM I THINKING AND FEELING LIKE THIS? I seriously wish that I could forget all about it. Not him just about the situatuon for a while. Dustin  a different one, not Doug's Dustin, he's in one of my summer school classes asked me out and I hesistated to say yes, seriously. Why do I feeling bad, or guilty.  The smell of chlorine seems to be over taking me so off to the shower I go...WOO HOO...OOO More later oh and  I saw Andrea today, but that's another drama department w'll save for later.

      ...I thought this title was soooo adorablely cute....and clever, and since I'm the only one that reads this, I'm the only one who gets it. So, I'm going to try to remember what I had written down on my other "blog" since I can't get to my other one......Remembering, that sounds to be quite hard....He left for Germany, and I miss him. He came over to my house the day before he left, and seriously it's not that I don't mind him coming over, because I don't at all. But I know I get bored being there, so I have to think that he does, but he still comes, and then we usually end up walking, for a while.He is so much fun. He's one of the few people who can acutally make me laugh....and I mean laugh, laugh. He is such an amazing person. He tried to teach my sister and Anna how to juggle, honestly now, how adorable is that? One day he is going to be such a wonderful dad. He is just such a good person. I seem to be more calm after I'm around him....Kinda weird, I know. But, whatever works, right? So my little sister, God love her. Although I thought I was going to kill her. She had asked me a couple days before if I could marry anyone from our school who would it be and she goes would it be Colby? And I said no, Colby is down and all I just wouldn't, because it's well....Colby. It would be like being with Abby(AKA the hott kid's sister). So, I told her Brent. And the one person she wasn't supposed to tell, Brent, she does. Oh my God, I just sat there. But...I played cool, I took it like a man. I was like yeah, I said that, and he said something to the affect of now I'm gonna have to workout or something, I don't remember word for word. Was that what he said, I don't really remember. But, I just kinda sat there and thought Why....I was kinda confused. But anyways, after our walk around the neighborhood, and when I say around, we went around my  ENTIRE  neighborhood. We came back and sat on my porch, and he kept looking at me, and it was funny, He was like don't you feel weird when your like across the room or something and you know someone is watching you and you feel all creeped out? I was like yeah, you're doing a good job. So then, he was getting ready to go eat with his family(One of my "Aw" moments of the day) and he was like I'm going to miss you, that's why I kept looking at you. And I mean SERIOUSLY you can't say anything better than that. My heart just  COMPLETELY  MELTED when he said that. I was just like OH MY GOD, I LOVE U!!! I seriously didn't know whether to smile or cry. And then Stacey enters my mind, and I think how do you I know he's not saying this to her, or if their together, why would he say something like that, and then I start feeling EXTREMELY GUILTY  because I'm like it's none of my business, we're not together(although God knows I wish) but, still I have no right to think that or to be jealous. It's a waste of time, that end up consuming me for the rest of the day. I'm going to miss him a whole lot. Not talking to him for those like 4 or 5 days almost drove me crazy, what am I going to do for 2 weeks, keep listening to the voice mails he left.He hugged me....multiple times before he left, he even  got to his car and then came back to hug me again. I told him that he better leave before I started to cry. And, I was fighting it as he was standing there and I know he had to of know I was going to. So I just waited until he left. And then I cried. So then there I go again wondering if she's doing the exact same thing. Missing him....I hate thinking about things like that becuase try as hard as I can to get it out of my head it doesn't leave.  WHY DO I KEEP THINKING THIS????? When I walked into the baseball game and I saw her there with his family. My heart sank, I wanted to cry and then I thought, I really did lose him. He's with her and all he and I are ever going to be is friends, now mind you this happened all before Friday night. When Robyn and I went to Panera. I just took a lucky guess that he would be working. And sure enough he was, I was really excited to see him, I couldn't stop smiling, even though I had yet to talk to him. I think I scared him. i was like ps ps ps. And he saw me and kinda jumped back, I was like ohhhh Helllllloooo! So then he came and hugged me and we talked, and it was fine again. He said he almost cried tears of joy, after seeing me, I was like aw. lol.  I miss him....have I mentioned this already?  LOLOL, I watched the news to make sure no planes crashed.now I know there is a VERY VERY VERY small chance that his plane would crash, but...still I dreamed it 3 different times, I just wanted to make sure that everything was okay. I keep distracting myself.  Sometimes I have to wonder why I keep doing this, Why I talk to him and hang out for a few days and then may not hear from him because he's probably with Stacey and then I go and get all jealous again, and then he calls and it all seems to go away, because even for a second I forget about everything when I'm with him.  I normally wouldn't spend this much time on a guy I knew I didn't have a chance with, but there's something about him that I can't let go of. He told me that he felt something between us, and I think that I might have too. Prom had to be one of the best times (without Alex) that I've had. It was so much fun, and it was because of him. He saved me. We just danced and danced and laughed and laughed. And nothing has changed since then, we still laugh and laugh...and dance....every now and then. LOL! We're dancing buddies, we established this at Ball's grad. parrrrty. When I'm with him I have the best time and I cannot stop smiling. He makes me giggle, and no one has been able to make me giggle that much since I was with Matt, almost 2 years ago. I want him and it sucks Leslie had this quote in her info and I stole it said, "I just wanted you to know I love the way you laugh and inside it's tearing me apart." I love his laugh, it just makes me smile, you just have to laugh too! Okay, I'm tired and have been at this for a while... I just saw this in Thompson's profile about his girlfriend..."If I had to choose between you and the world I'd choose the world and give it to you." Golly Goodness, how adorable is that....Sorry I just thought that I would share...Sweet Dreams

      So, this would be my new, new blog, since certain people, who shall remain nameless have changed my password and won' tell me what it is. Seriously now how mean are you, thats not cool. Not that anyone reads this to actaully answer me, but still. So, I still haven't talked to Matt, and I'm starting to kinda feel bad, yeah only kinda. I need to talk to him and give him his thing back before Nate says something to him about him calling me ALL of the time. I mean PART and only part of it is my fault but I mean honestly who calls hangs up and calls again. The entire situation kinda creeped me out. There is a point when a person touches you or tells you they miss you and stuff like that where you completely melt inside and there are people who it makes you feel COMPLETELY creeped out, yep that would definetly be Matt. no offense to him or anything, I just don't see him like that, I don't think I ever have, or ever will. He's definetly a cool kid, but i just don't like him like that. And I seriously think Nate is going to like hurt him or something. And I wish I was kidding when I say that, and the funny thing is they both hate each other and they've never met. Matt doesn't like Nate because he "doesn't like the way" he treats me and Alex. And I'm like dude he's not a bad person, he just has commitment issues. He's all like well I'm gonna kick his ass if I see him. Now I'm sitting here trying not to die laughing since I could break him in half, I could only imagine what Nathan would do. And Nate's all like why the hell does he call you all the time, my answer...shrugging my shoulders. I think I'm going to call him tomorrow and tell him that I left my phone in Dave's car last week and Dave went out of town with his dad, so I couldn't get it. And tell him to just come up to school to get it so I only have to see him for like 2 seconds and then be done with him. He left me a message on Friday night and he was all like I know why your not talking to me and blah blah blah. He was like I know your dating Brent, I was like humm that's news to me. But whatever, I'll figure it all out later.

         311.....amazing amazing band. They seriously kick ass. It had to be one of the best things I've ever done. Earlier, Jesse and I go down to Sweet 98 to get the V.I.P. parking pass, which I couldn't get because they said that it was too late to pick up, which kinda sucked, because we spent almost an hour and a half, going down there, getting lost for 20 minutes, not knowing where to go. So like I told Jesse, I was like I think, no I know he's dating this girl and I will seriously be COMPLETELY and udderly totally pissed off if she comes. I said there will seriously be words going on and I will and come find you. I wouldn't have said anything to her excpet good luck with him, because she didn't do anything, but I would definetly well at him. Like seriously that's not cool, and he deliberatly lied to me. I've asked him repeatedly if their dating, atleast so I wouldn't be led on anymore, and get over him, and not care.   So I was kinda gettin worried becuase it was almost 4 and was on the phone to my dad just bitching on and on at how he hadn't called and I was gettin ready to call Jesse and go with him and I get off the phone and my phone voicemail song is playing so he called..finally, and left a voicemail,and so he said he'd come about 6:30 or somethin. So I'm gettin ready and brushin my teeth and puttin straightenin my hair and puttin on make-up..DON'T ask me why, I honestly have no idea why i was getting ready. So he calls and is like I'm coming and I was like HOLY SHIT. So he shows up..with Zane and Brent Brewer(guess who got to sit by him..heh), mom gets home, or so I thought, Thomas is at the door, phone is ringin, cell phone is ringing and I'm like ahhhh OH MY GOD!!!!!! I was so overwhelmed I could have cried. Since their are 2 Brent's...it will have to be Brent(Brewer), and Brent( B-flem)   So we go and get Becky and Emily and their friend Dorie(hmmm makes you wonder) so we go down to.....Borders and were waiting for Noah and Ross, because we were going to go smoke with them. It was one of my ohhh okay moments, where you smile, nod and go along with it. So they come, and we don't have anywhere to go. So Noah calls Bill, Bill says we can go to his house and chill, his mom is there, his mom....smokes with us..weird you may ask...HMMMM I THINK SO! But whatever. So we're all sittin around and I'm just sittin there, and I'm just chillin, and I'm sitting between B-Flem and Zane, and he just is sittin there laughin, and I mean like almost on the floor laughin, and I look over at Brent, and he's just like wtf. So like 5 minutes later, he's still laughing, so I kinda start and then Brent starts and Noah is just like what the hell is so funny. So, we leave.   And we park on like 50th and something so we have to walk, so Brent and I were like it's 8, let's run so we don't miss anything. So we take off running, and we're runnin, and runnin and still runnin, and run a red light, almost get hit, and keep on runnin.Great fun. Great fun.   We get there and lose everyone, meaning B-Flem, Zane, Tristan, and Z. So then we meet up with them again and walk to go watch and we end up in the back, and Brent was like hell no I'm goin up there, so we mosey and push our way up to the front. "Other" Brent went into the mosh pit and B-Flem and I chilled until we found Tristan, Zane and Z. And then me Tristan and B-Flem pushed our way into the mosh pit. There...all hell broke loose. People everywhere jumpin around and pushin and shovin and crowd surfin, by far one of the best concerts ever. So they tried to crowd surf Z and he got 3 feet and fell face first, and got a concusion. So me, Tristan and B-Flem make our way into the mosh pit. FUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN! We lost Brent and B-Flem and Tristan held onto me the entire time, because I told him that if he lost me I would kill him. The concert kicked ass!!

        Seriously....I think it's time to give up on Brent. He's with her and it's just taken me this long to actaully realize it. We decided we would go to the 311 concert tomorrow night together. And he was like you never told me it was free, I was like ummm listen to the radio. So a few days ago Jesse asked me if I would go. I could go with him, Allen, and Trevor. So i was down with that because I hadn't talked to Brent in a while and just thought that he forgot what with Staci and all, you know. He's a little side tracked. Although the other night he got on for like 5 minutes and was like I just wanted to see how you were doing. That was my aww moment of the day, even though I kinda thought it was bullshit...but whatever you know. He told me that Brewer might go with us....which heh...definetly so NOT a bad thing by any means. I mean daHHamnnnnn boy, you fioyn. The concert should be fun, because dammit if it isn't, I'll fucking make it. And then I'll go find Jesse....heh heh heh..Like I seriously told my mom I was like if she's there, i'm callin him and I was like would you be mad? She goes no, as long as you come home alive.

      Yes, I am now to the point where I can honestly say that I have issues with trusting people. A year or 2 ago I would deny it. And several years before that I would tell people my life. Which wasn't always necessarily a bad thing, but most of the time it was because, you know high school girls...they talk. But that's only not even half of my problem. I'm scared of getting too close to people, becuase every time I do, they leave me. And I hate it. Brent and I once again had the trust conversation. And I don't really know if he seems to understand why I don't trust people. I told him that and he's like I'm not people, I'm Brent. I was like umm thanks captain obvious, because I didn't know that. So while I'm talking to him, I'm talking to Danny. And Danny knows all about this because when Danny liked me like 2 years ago, he and i had this conversation all of the time. So he Danny, being the understanding one of the 2 of us, was like you know, you have no reason not to trust him, and it's not that I don't or anything but you can't just expect me to say yes I tust you with everything that I have in 2 months. I trust him for the most part, but I don't know I don't completely. It's not that he's a bad person and lies to me all the time. Because he's not...at all. He's probably one of the best people that I know. He is a really great person. So Danny goes on to tell me that that he thinks Brent likes me and wants to know if I trust him , so that I can date him. That kind of confused me, but then again it made sense, but then again, isn't he dating Stacey? It honestly is so confusing. And then I have to think that there is a slim possibility that Danny could be right, and then by not completely trusting him I could be pushing him away and making him think that I don't like him.  I trust him, I do. And I want to. I trust him more than I trust most people, and in a way that scares me.But part of me doesn't want to trust him, and I don't know why. And that scares me too. Part of me wants to trust him so much that I'm afraid of getting hurt.  I'm afraid that I'll get really close to or something and then he'll be like oh I'm sorry I don't think I like you anymore, and then say that he is dating Stacey. And then I honestly have NO idea what in the hell I would do. I could'nt handle that. I can't handle losing anymore people in my life.  I need to figure out what to do.....

      So summer school offically ended today. I was extremely excited. But also very sad at the same time. It's like you get to know these people and you become such good friends with them over a period of time and your so close, and it sucks that we all god to different school except Robyn, Cassie, Danny, and me. Most of them go to South, which I guess is better than West, so that's good? I dunno. But I'm going to miss all of them so much, especially Robyn, not that she goes to a different school and I can't see her whenever I want or anything, but I'm going to miss seeing her everyday. She and i were talking about that yesterday and we were all sad, and it was like golly goodness, it feels like we're breaking up. So then I made her laugh, for a long time in which she started coughing as usual, and there for thats when I laugh, not to be me or anything, all in good fun! Cassie, I will certainly miss her drama with Alisha and Morgan over TIM out of all things, Tim, I mean honestly. Nd Chelsea, who is just one of the weirdest people I know. And Derek, he is just such a good person, crazy and weird at times, but aren't we all. He is just one of those people that you can just sit and talk to. Most of the time it was about boys, and then he would keep bringing up Dustin, which was a little weird, but beggers can't be choosey...or something like that anyway. And then he graduates early to go into the Marnies. What is it with South boys and the Marines, honestly. Travis is just one of those kids you really can't like see yourself without a person like him in your life. He's just so carefree and careless, but not in the dumb way. He's also obsessed with the Marines. Kinda scary at times, but that's how he is, and that's the way you have to take him. Hadley, she is just an all around good kid, funnier than hell, but shes down. She was telling us the other day how the summer of 7thg rade she was at a party and wasn't watching her drink and some guy raped her and she got pregnant. And then she had and abortion. And then last summer or sometime last year she was dating this guy and she was on birth-control and she got pregnant again and then she found out he had been cheating on her for the last 3 months so she told her mom and got another abortion, but didn't tell the guy because he didn't deserve to know. I....agree? Andrew(Hagen) he's a cool kid, he's funny as hell though, and....the kid I shall miss the most, besides Jordy....the SMELLY KID, now he definetly does not smell bad, it's a good smell...believe me! His name is Andrew too, and let me tell ya he is a hunny. And seriously, oh my gosh he smells INCREDIBLE!! And all it is...Lucky. It smells very different when its not in a bottle at the Buckle or on Max. But, honestly...WOW! So he finally brought it to school and he randomly sprayed me, which I didn't mind cuz I smelled good. But people were all like you smell like a boy, who were you with. So I smile and point to him, in which casae they would all be like heyyyyyyyyyy and I'd smile and walk away, and he was close enough to hear, and would sit there and smile. It was rather amusing. I definetly wore a skirt today and Andrew( not the smelly one, Hagen) So we're all sitting on the "bench" which is definetly the consession stand area.... he tried to life up my skirt and I hit him upside the head. LOL, pretty hard too, which was by reaction. So during break people have issues with grabbing my legs and pulling me off of the counter....so Derek, being the ass that he is tries to several times and so im not really paying attention the last time cuz the smelly kid and I were laying our heads on each other, so Derek grabs my feet and pulls me...so I sqeak really loud, and throw my arms around Andrew's(smelly kid) shoulders and still get pulled off....bringing him with me. So then they all laughed while I'm almost having a heart attack, and I swear I was going to pass out, not that it was the horrible, it just scared the hell out of me, so Smelly kid is standing there like holding me, because I almost have a panic attack. And Nate sits there and looks at me like i have COMPLETELY lost my mind....so that's my story and I'm stickin to it.

      So this Dustin guy, I hung out with him on Saturday night we hung out at his house and watched Fight Club and then went Downtown with his sister Heather, and their friends Dave and Brandy. We went to go watch the fireworks at Rosenblatt. So they were supposed to start at 9:30...definetly did not start until 11:30. Or around there. So we're chillin at his house and were watchin this movie. And he goes upstairs to tell Lexy(his little niece) bye and so he comes back down and sits down and leans over to try and kiss me! And I backed up and he was like What? I was like Nothing. He he like puts his hand on my face and kisses me which in turn i have no choice because I can't back up because myhead is against the  couch and his hand is on my neck so I can't turn.  But I didn't kiss him back, at first,which I felt kind of bad about, but then after I talked to Cassie the other day we both came to the conclusion that he could turn into one of those scary guys who would like rape you or something. So I ended up kissing him back and we kissed for a couple minutes and then I just kinda stopped. And the bad part about it, I didn't feel anyting. Which I don't know if that's supposed to mean something or what. But most the the time the one thought that was running through my head was me and Brent dancing at prom. Is that sad or what? So,I told him when I first got there I might fall asleep. Hummmm What did you think I did....I fell "asleep"  So I learned that I can fake sleep extremely well. Because I ended up "sleeping" for 2 hours. Which again I felt bad about. Then he "woke" me up and I moved to his bed...hmm Mistake you might ask. Um I would definetly say so. But aha you have to know how to play the game...I "slept" on my stomach...ha ha which mean't he could touch me or anything which I was very proud of, no help from Alex which God knows I wanted to call her and cry. I wanted to leave. And the entire time I was there and when I was kissing him the one person that always comes into my mind did. And I almost called him his name...sevral different times. So I finaly "wake" up because we have to leave because Dave is coming. So dave definetly did not come for like a half-n-hour. And now that I'm "awake" and laying in his bed, this could only mean one thing. Hummm lets think about this one. Well if your wondring if I did. I didn't. I'm a good girl. And when I say that I don't mean it sarcastically because I am. we just kissed for a long time. which seemed like forever and the entire time all I wanted to do was stop. And the entire time all I could think of was him. I felt horrible. I felt like I wa cheating on someone, and that everything could have ended there. I tried to call home to see if my dad could give me some sort of excuse to come home or soemthing...but no answer. they went downtown with Aunt Rhonda, Uncle jason, and Carolyn, Gage, and Jaden. Danny called and I had to stop myself from saying come and get me because I was that uncomfortable.  So let's back up a little bit. So we're kissing and he goes "You know Rachel, I think that you should go out with me." I was like Now why would I go and do something like that? He goes I dont know because you want to. I was like well who says I do. And it ended there. Does that mean that I said yes? Becuase I really hope that it doesn't. I don't think that I like him. I mean ou know that something is there when you get nervous around them and get that little feeling in your stomach.  Well when he kissed me I didn't feel anything. Nothing. Nothing at all! And I didn't get nervous or shy around him. And I acted differently. When I'm with Brent I act like myself. And even if I'm sitting next to him I get nervous. I've never kissed Brent, but when he hugs me I get that little feeling in my stomach, even if its just for a second. And I'm starting to think that I like that even better. I like being with him more than I like being with Dustin. That right there...scares me.
