      we move in two days!!    today was my first day off in two weeks, so it was a catching up day with running errands, packing, cleaning, laundry, and i also snuck a nap in.  we were suppose to close on our new place in the morning, but our realtor called and it got bumped back till thursday now.  bummer!    we can't wait to have a place of our own.  it will be an adjustment.  we live in a one bedroom apt now with pink carpet and wood paneling(ceiling to floor) in our living room and the bathroom was bright purple(we changed that asap).  Our new place is technically four floors.  i guess we will get our exercise, huh?    since we are moving...there might be a delay in my blogs.  i will keep you posted as much as i can.

      all my life, my sister michelle has been responsible for cutting my hair. she moved back to the midwest and therefore i had to find the next michelle to cut my hair.  finally some great friends advised me to go see beth.    today i went to see beth.  she works at  urlLink not so plain jane's .  this was my 4th or 5th time going to her and i love it.  i finally found someone that can do thick hair.    but today, while she was washing my hair (no other feeling like when they wash your hair, huh?), she said she had just found out that the guy she had been dating is getting married.  i was confused.  i asked how she found out, did he just tell you.  my mouth dropped to the floor when she told me she read it in the newspaper this morning.  she called up one of his buddies to see if this was true.  he told her not to believe everything you read in the papers.  do people lie about their marriage in the papers?    i told beth that my mother just found out this week her guyfriend was dating someone else.  she gave me some advice to tell my mother.  i can't tell you what she said, because my mother reads this...so i have to keep it clean (smile), but it was funny.       then she told me her mother was attacked at the local grocery store with a knife this week.  luckily her mother was not hurt...she fought him off, but a little scary knowing that was just down the road.  the guy who did this was tackled down by two other guys and he has a $30,000 bail now.    was it worth it?  i wonder what was going through this man's mind.  did he really think he wasn't going to get caught?  sick people out there.    please be careful.

      that is what it says in front of rick's house.  rick is dear to my mother's heart and he broke it tuesday night.    mom met rick about three years ago at  urlLink ozark christian college  (OCC) where they both work.  they started seeing each other and making memories.  one of the best memories mom had was working alongside him on his big, beautiful house he was building.  when they worked together, dreams were made, the future was talked about and then things changed.   last year my mother was told she had breast cancer.    there are two things in life i will never understand.  why great people, like my mother, have to deal with an illness like cancer and why the most creative, most deserving person i know, my sister, can't seem have babies.  it is not right and it doesn't seem fair.   cancer is scary and all along rick was by her side.  he came to the hospital the day she went into surgery.  he was there when we almost lost her due to an allergic reaction she had to the blue dye they shot inside her to trace the cancer cells.  she spent the night in ICU that night and he was there. the doctors couldn't continue with the surgery, so the next day she had to go do this all over again (minus the blue dye, of course).  Pain is the feeling of almost loosing someone you love so dearly.     as time went on and mom started chemo and finished with radiation, things began to change between mom and rick.  she felt him pull away more and more.  he didn't stop by the house as much.  she wasn't going over to his house to help.    what happened?  why all of a sudden did things start not working out for them?  it seemed so right.  it felt nice to know my mother was loved and taken care of.  i thought it was God's plan.  we all did.  last week mom drove by the house and saw the "for sale" sign.  she wept.  what have i done, she thought.  doubt began to creep up inside of her.  did i make the right choice in ending this relationship, she asked...    tuesday night, she decided she needed closer.  our family had spent lots of time at his house helping out.  my brother started documenting each time on his camera.  so mom brought over the tape and video they had made for him.  he showed her around and he said the words that broke her heart.  he told her as she was leaving that he was seeing someone else.  memories of my father start to flash in her head.  those were the words my dad once said to her over ten years ago when he left.    why do good people have to suffer?  isn't that the question everyone asks?  we are told that in the hard times we grow and build character, but come on...it sucks.  i hate seeing and hearing my mother cry over someone.  why can't someone love her they way she deserves to be loved?  why did God allow her to get hurt again?  wasn't my dad enough?  this time it was suppose to be different!    God please don't let her get hurt again.  she has been through enough.  what more are you trying to teach her?  help us all to understand.

      good news... Aimee is back!!!  she just emailed me.  now she won't be in the office until friday...but it is comforting to know she is back in NH.  if you could see me, i have a big smile on my face.  bad news... my hubby bought me (don't laugh)  urlLink jessica simpson  tickets for tonight and i just found out the concert has been postponed.  she has a kidney infection.  now i have a frown.  i was looking forward to it, but hopefully she will reschedule.

      i have a new toy.  i am trying to figure it out now.  it is complicated for a non-techy like myself, but fun.  it is called a " urlLink Blackberry " (mom...i am not talking about food.)  i will send you my email address soon.  you can email me and it works the same as if you were paging me.  this is for work related issues mostly, but no one else will use or read the emails but me.    right now i have been carring around two on-call pagers, our old wyndtel pager, this new blackberry pager, and my cell phone.  it is just too much.  can't wait for aimee to be back in the office and take all this way from me.  two more days!!!  then i will have my cell phone and blackberry.  i need simple.

      my dad left me a message at work today with the results of my grandad.  i called michelle to see if she got the chance to actually talk with dad.  she did and filled me in.  they ran the tests and decided to send grandad home with meds and bedrest was a must.  michelle, my sister, works at a hospital and has been familiar with these tests and assured me that if anything negative would have come up they would not have sent him home, so i guess that is good news.  the cardiologist will look at the test results over the week and call my grandparents by the end of the week with their options.    so we wait again.  i am on a roller coaster ride of emotions.    i didn't sleep hardly at all last night.  i worked all day and had a meeting after work.  i am tired.  i do have to share that right at 5pm i got this phone call at work from a lawyer.  we had been playing phone tag all last week.  long story short...he refuses to pay for the interpreters (remember i shared before that i spend a lot of time advocating the rights of deaf people).  i told him i could not fill this request until the billing situation was resolved.  he got very upset with me and the conversation ended in him telling me it was my fault this meeting could not happen and hung up on me. (shouldn't lawyers know what the law is?)  needless to say, this was not what i needed to finish out my day.  i started to cry and was shaking so bad that i called jeremiah and asked him to type up what had just happened.  we have to document everything.    it goes to show that you never know what the person on the other end of the line or who you bump into every day at the gas station or grocery store is dealing with.  would this lawyer had talked to me differently if he knew that the night before i had just found out someone i love is struggling for life and having to make tough decisions on their health?    are we patient enough with people we don't know?  are we patient enough with people we do know?  it is impossible to understand everything that goes on inside people, even our closest friends and family because we aren't them.    i want to listen more to the people around me.  life is too short not too.

      i just found out that my grandad kakac has had a heart attack.    my sister rachel called from dad's (they are there for father's day) to say that dad just told them grandad had been having mild heart attacks all week, but this morning was worst then the others.  for awhile he has been having trouble and i have been told only 60% of his heart is working.    i hung up with rach and called michelle.  we called dad (three-way-calling) to wish him happy father's day.  he got everyone on the phone (rach and tyler) and told michelle and i what he just told rach and tyler about grandad.  i guess only 30% of grandad's heart is working now.  the arteries around his heart are so weak that an operation might not be successful.   tomorrow is a big day.  my grandparents, aunts and uncles are in nashville, tn (my aunt lives there & the hospital is there) right now for testing all day tomorrow. the tests will determine what is going on inside my grandad and if it is fixable.  with modern meds these days...most things are fixable, but at what time do you say, "it is my time to go?"  my sister and i were talking tonight and we know that grandad is ready to go, but are we ready to see him go?    i haven't seen him in over five years.  this is my dad's dad.  miah and i were planning a trip to visit them in August (that trip could come sooner if things don't go well tomorrow).  i am kicking myself for not making more trips and memories with him and my grandma.  they make up the best memories on my childhood...when everything seemed simple.    i remember homemade rolls grandma would make, her making us eat until our tummies exploded, everyday opening some silly creation grandma made each grandchild in december (toot-toots were one of my favorites), pictures all over their walls, mud fights, berry picking, sewing, hearing grandad's stories, the outhouse, tire swing, scaventure hunts, did i mention those rolls?  i can taste them now.  yummy!  it is that time in my life were health issues seem to be the topic in conversation.  getting older is hard.  when i was young, i never thought about death or illness.  now...someone, somewhere in my life is dealing with breast cancer, heart troubles, high blood pressure, back pain, swollen ankles, broken bones, sever morning sickness every day, kidney transplant, cancer, etc.    how do doctors do it?    please pray for my grandad and for my dad.  i can't imagine what he is going through right now.  thx.

      this was the craziest week ever.  okay maybe the fourth craziest...or fifth.  i am not quit sure yet.    i work for a small, non-profit organization called  urlLink Northest Deaf and Hard or Hearing Services, Inc.   I work in the referral deptartment were myself and Aimee take requests for sign language interpreters.  We spend the majority of our time on the computer, paging our interpreters so fill these doctor appointments, court dates, graduation, staff meetings, etc.  The other portion of our time is advocating for Deaf people in our community.  There is a law called The American with Disabilities Act (ADA) that was passed a few years back that states that deaf people are not responsible for paying the interpreters fees, etc.  As you can imagine...business don't want to hear that.    Anyways...this week and next week, Aimee (who had been there for over two years) is on her honeymoon in Hawaii.  I have been working at NDHHS since Sept part time and love it, but our job is not a one person job.    The other challenge is being the only hearing person in the office.  our office is made up of three deaf staff, four hearing staff, and one hard of hearing staff member.  After 1pm everyday...i am it.  i answer the phones, interpret phone calls for the deaf staff members, etc.  On top of all that, i have to maintain my job in getting interpreters to the right places, fill all the requests that come in, put everything in our database and send out confirmation letters, etc.  It is stressful.  i did mention i love it though, right?  i do!!!!  i started my adventure in 1995.  i took my first sign language classes in lincoln, il.  long story short...i recently just graduated from the University of New Hampshire at Manchester (May 2004) with a sign language interpreting degree.  I am blessed to be working where i do. i am in the heart of the deaf community and everyday i meet new deaf people and interpreters.  the networking is amazing.    i have four more days till Aimee is back.  couldn't come soon enough.  oh yeah...also this week was my first car wreck by myself.  i have been in wrecks with miah, but not with just me.  this lady two cars behind me said she was looking down to get her glasses and rear ended the car behind me which hit me as well.  it was awful.  luckily i wasn't in our new car, but the new, used one we just bought a couple months ago.  no damage really.  a couple scratches, but not a big deal.  no one was hurt.  although that night...my back was killing me.  it is better now...so no worries.    we also this week picked up a free couch on the side of the road.  we couldn't get ahold of any friends with a truck (where are the winans when you need them?), so we managed to (miah and i) pick up the couch and put it on top of our small chevy caviler, bungy it up and drive it to our place a few blocks away.  what a sight.  that wasn't as bad as miah and i carrying it up to our apt on the second floor.  let's just say...i got a little sassy...or maybe cranky.    one more adventure that happened and then i will sign off.  first time blogging and a novel comes out.  last night...i went to go interpret for this deaf woman who lives in timbuck-china.  a friend of hers bought some land and built a bed & breakfast.  the meadow across from the B&B is up for sale.  they are afraid that someone would buy it and built on it...even thou it is a swamp and you can't really do that, but whatever.  so this woman i was interpreting for last night met up with one of the neighbors to walk through what her boundary lines were.    first of all...i was running late.  it was really out in the middle of no where.  i had called miah just to make sure the direction she gave me were right.  i met her at her beautiful log house and then we drove over to her new swamp she just bought.  since i was running late...i forgot to put my tennis shoes on that i brought.  i was in sandals walking around a swamp.  the mosquitos were eating me alive.  when we got to the neighbors house, who hunts, we went inside and every animal you can imagine is in this house.  I was scared.  i asked him if he killed all these animals himself.  he said all but the mountain lion.  i wish i had the camera on me.  it was so hard for me to interpret with all these animals staring at me.  there was a full size black bear in his house!  what is wrong with this picture?    we headed out in his jeep to god knows where.  we saw wild turkeys on this adventure.  everytime he would stop the jeep, get out and start yelling to shoo them away.  they were eating his corn he just planted.  he was rough, but so funny and kind.  it was an adventure to say the least.  did i mention i was in sandals and this was a swamp she bought?  lets just say...i was ready to come home.    but home was filled with about 15 smelly guys miah had invited over to play cards.  i ran as fast as i could to the bedroom and crashed.  (not before i called rachel and mom though...thanks for listening mom.)  well...this is it.  my crazy week in a nut shell.  i think miah and i are going to go to a movie now.    keep checking in.

      mom returned from CO and had a great time. she slept out on their porch, hiked, shopped, visited  urlLink camp como  (the camp i worked at one summer as a cook), watched movies, etc. she is back to work and wishing she never left CO.  i haven't talked to mich and john in awhile. tried to call this morning and woke them up. it was 8am their time. i thought they would be awake, because i knew this was VBS week. john says their VBS is at night. oops! sorry j and m.  can't say enough about rach. we have been talking more and i have enjoyed our sister chats. we didn't always get along growing up. i missed out on a lot of years with her because of that. these last few years and especially the last couple of months have been the best for me. she is getting ready to start school and she has warned me things could be different. she will be much busier than she is right now. i told her we will pick up where we left off next summer when school is done then...smile.  tyler is still at dad's till sunday. i got a page from him a couple nights ago and it sounds like he is ready to be back home. he got his scuba certification. my dad is a huge scuba guy. he would love for all his kids to be certified, but that won't happen. keep dreaming dad. (he doesn't read this...so i can say that) still can't believe tyler is a senior in high school this year.  as far as miah and i...  miah just got back from a two day camping/rafting trip with some students from MCC. they went up to maine. it was only guys, so good times were had. he did see a moose for the second time since we have been out here. the first time was the walgreens parking lot near our place at the time.  i have shared i have been overwhelmed with picking colors, furniture, etc for this new place. so my friend carissa came over and helped me figure out a look we wanted. it was so fantastic. when we were done we went to grab a bite to eat, but stopped at tjmax before. what carissa can do and so many others, is look at something and say 'this would look good here' or 'you should do this with that.' i don't have that gift. i got a glimpse of that when shopping with her. it was so great!  i did buy us a bed set that night. i got a comforter, bedskirt, and pillow shams all for 50 bucks. it is red with a gold leaf pattern on it. i love it! i was afraid miah might not. he was gone when i bought it. but he likes it. whew! i also bought a couch cover for our freeby couch we picked up on the side of the road. it is really nice, but i think it is going to "make me violent," as my friend carissa would say. i hate couch covers because they mess up so easy and i will spend hours of my life fixing it. oh well...it is better than the green color showing.  not much more went on this week.  i do have two shout outs to give.  first to my grandma kakac (picture below).  her birthday is today...HAPPY BIRTHDAY!  also to someone very special to my heart.  i hope we can play together one day.  thinking of you this week.

      i was sitting at work today bored out of my mind.  i noticed rach was online so we started chatting.  i asked rach if she had any big plans this weekend.  she told me her and her boyfriend were going to see a movie tonight.  i told her miah and i were planning on going to a movie as well and i was bummed we couldn't go with and double date. when she told me what movie they were going to...i wasn't really interested.  so what movie do we end up seeing tonight? ...the same one.  'the village' was good.  it was packed and everyone jumped a few times during the movie.  i might have enjoyed it better if i didn't have to pee so bad (that was not so fun).  i won't say anymore in case you haven't seen it yet. if you like suspense...go see this movie. (pee before though)

      friday night after work i went to watch a movie with the deaf community. i wasn't sure how it was going to work, but looked forward to seeing everybody and hanging out. they rented a room in the bowling alley and we watched 'the last samurai' with tom cruise. (he's dreamy!!!)    aimee and i got there and we ended up being the only hearing people there, besides some hearing kids running around. deaf people have this misconception that all hearing people are smart and know everything. it is sad really. many deaf children, especially of hearing parents(90% of deaf children are born into hearing families), are taught they are not normal because they can't hear. these parents strive to make them as 'normal' as they can, forcing them to learn english and be involved in a culture/community completely different than their own. i will never understand hearing people's misconception of the deaf community. they are an amazing group of people. i will tell you this...they know what community is and it is from them i learned how us hearing people are clueless about what it means to share life together.     anyways...we started the movie and it began to be choppy at times. they were projecting the movie from a laptop computer. as soon as this happens...aimee and i felt all these eyes looking at us. we took an intermission and tried to figure out the problem. it happened a couple more times and everytime they would look to us to fix it as if we knew better than they did. if they only knew...sure i can hear, but i am clueless about computer stuff.     i started getting upset. deaf people can't go the movie theaters like we can. this was there one chance to come together and watch a movie, for a lot cheaper than what we pay to go see a movie...i might add. they were all enjoying this movie and i didn't want them not to finish. almost half way through the movie...as silly as this may sound...i said a little prayer. 'god...please make the rest of this movie be smooth. this is their one chance to enjoy a movie as a community.' as corny as that may have felt praying for, it stopped. the rest of the movie was smooth, no more choppy scenes, nothing. i was so thankful and they loved the movie. i can't imagine having to read an interior movie, but they do it daily, so it was good to be in their shoes and read along with them for once.

      one more thing before i go to bed...  today at work, aimee told me she was listening to the howard stern show this morning and they had a porn star on there and blah, blah, blah was all i heard after she said his name (if you don't know who he is or haven't seen the show...you are not missing anything and please don't waiste your time).  it was hard to know what to do or how to react.  i shared what i thought and she says to me that "when it is too much for me, i just shut it off, but i completely support the show and think it needs to be on the air/tv.  it is important people have freedom of speech."   oh boy....  miah and i are having dinner with them tonight and i am so nervous.  i am not sure why, but i want her to know i am head over heals for god and yet...i want her and her hubby to not feel weird around us when they do find out.  do they know already?  how are we showing them?  it is too late to go into this.  i will let you know what happens.

      miah and i went to the stuart's house&nbsp;for dinner last night.&nbsp; we got there and it took a lot for me not to tear up.&nbsp; sam and max, their two boys,&nbsp;had grown up so much since i saw them last and we used to play two time a week not too long ago.&nbsp; time flys by and when i saw sam and max i couldn't help but think about my two older fraley boys, connor and evan (picture below)&nbsp;   now what to the stuart's and the fraley's boys have in common?&nbsp; well.... urlLink thomas the train .&nbsp; that was when i almost lost it.&nbsp; sam got out his trains and i missed my friend connor.&nbsp; we would build tracks together and play trains everytime i came over.&nbsp; he and evan knew each of the trains names and&nbsp;i would always get them wrong, but i tried.&nbsp; i didn't know how much i missed not having kids in our life&nbsp;until last night when i saw thomas, percy, edward, james and so many, many more&nbsp;(see boys..i haven't forgotten completely).&nbsp;&nbsp;   the fraley team has been a big part or our lives in nh.&nbsp; jeff and miah&nbsp;became very close and eventually i was introduced to janet,&nbsp;jeff's wife.&nbsp; she&nbsp;will be reading this and i don't mean to embarrass you, but i have to say she is&nbsp;an amazing example of a&nbsp;servant.&nbsp; she has been a great friend to me and so&nbsp;very supportive.&nbsp; i&nbsp;admire her love for her boys.&nbsp; those boys...including jeff...are blessed to have her in their life.&nbsp;   we were very sad, and i will admit mad at times, to hear they were moving away last winter.&nbsp; see&nbsp;miah and jeff seemed to have the same vision for&nbsp;'river's edge', or&nbsp;'the way'&nbsp;if we let jeff name&nbsp;our&nbsp;gatherings.&nbsp;&nbsp;(sorry..inside joke)&nbsp; they saw the big picture and worked so well as a team to share this vision with the&nbsp;rest of us.&nbsp; we met at their house every week for dinner and worship.&nbsp; it was neat to see what god was doing in each of our lives.&nbsp; you start to feel like everyone is family, especially when yours is so far away.&nbsp; that is why it hurt to see them go.&nbsp;   miah and i were crushed, because&nbsp;there was a&nbsp;detour in 'our' plans,&nbsp;but god had a different plan for&nbsp;river's edge and a different plan for the fraleys.&nbsp; it is so interesting to me&nbsp;how&nbsp;he works each detail out in our lives.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;   anyways...we love and miss you fraley team.&nbsp; we wish we could be around to play and laugh together.&nbsp; thanks for being who you are and we look forward to many memories together.&nbsp;

      i hate bad hair days.&nbsp; it ruins the whole day.&nbsp; as you can see in pictures below...my hair is wicked short and therefore i can't pull it back in a ponytail or anything.&nbsp; it just hangs in my face...ugh.&nbsp; i told my sister, michelle that i don't think i could ever go back to long hair again...i think i lied.&nbsp; today i wish i had my long hair back.&nbsp;   tonight we are going over to the stuart's house for dinner.&nbsp; before i got this job i used to watch their two boys for extra money.&nbsp; they are a great family and we haven't seen or hung out with them in a while.&nbsp; we are looking forward to it.&nbsp;   i have written a little bit about my co-worker aimee.&nbsp;&nbsp;i shared my struggle with what do you do with people like aimee who want nothing to do with religion.&nbsp;&nbsp; well...she and her new hubby invited miah and i over for dinner&nbsp;this saturday night.&nbsp; i am a little nervous,&nbsp;but i pray you will use us that night, god!&nbsp;

      my mother leaves for Colorado tomorrow. she is meeting up with college friends of hers and spending a week hanging out, talking about old memories and making new ones. my mother never does anything for herself, so i am excited she is going on this adventure.   yesterday michelle emailed me saying they bought a house in Springfield, IL. she said it is her dream house. john says, "michelle, me buying a house is like you buying a set of golf clubs. you would never want a set of golf clubs. i never would care about having a house. but just know that every time you walk through the front door that your husband love you." what can i say...she married a romantic.&nbsp; congrats!   miah and i are having the fosters over for dinner tomorrow night.&nbsp; i am a little nervous about this, because they are amazing cooks. &nbsp;she makes me laugh and i love hanging out with her.&nbsp; they are excited about coming over. &nbsp;hopefully everything will be a success and we won't have any more floods.   speaking of floods...i haven't had hot water or the use of my dish&nbsp;washer in a week (cuz of flood #3). our friend steve finally came over today and miah emailed me at work saying he charges $80 an hour.&nbsp; i almost peed my pants. (i am in the wrong profession) the dish washer was not hooked up well and he had to do a lot to make it all function right. &nbsp;all is well and i am on my second load of dishes.   rachel is 20 and 'thinks she is all that and a bag of chips." right, rach?&nbsp; okay not really...i&nbsp;had to say that because rach and i were chatting about that the other day. rach is keeping busy&nbsp;at working at  urlLink CIY . (my dad was the president of CIY for several years before he left the family and now 13 years later my sister rachel works there) interesting! rachel will be a junior in college (ozark christian) this year.   tyler is at CIY this week. he spends most of his summer at my dad's, but came back to go to CIY with his youth group. i haven't talked to him in a long time...so i don't know what is going on. he will be a senior this year in high school.   i love you, family!

      yesterday was my last day off before i start full time at  urlLink NDHHS .  you would think that i would have big plans, but i listened to a friend of ours give us a demo of "Kirby" vacuums, watched tv, took a short nap and then miah took me out to dinner and we rented 'Bad Santa.' (do not recommend the movie...i wanted to chop my leg off several times)  he took me to  urlLink 'Carrabbas Italian Grill'  in Bedford, NH.  it was so good.  so good, i can't imagine eating anything today.  wow!    have any of you seen a "Kirby" vacuum in action?  that was so discussing to see what it picked up.  i took pictures.  i will put them on my blog tonight sometime.  if the stupid machine didn't cost $1500, i would get one in a second.  we all live in filth.  well...time to leave for work.  hope you all have a great day.

      on my first blog (6/19/04) i told you about my adventure with the #1 interpreting job in timbuck-china.  well, last tuesday night (7/6) i went and interpreted for the same deaf woman (Naomi).  not near as far and not near as crazy.  it is great to be able to get my feet wet with this interpreting thing.  i am not yet certified or licenced, but this deaf woman has taken me in and allowed me to work a little in the real world.  the real world is so much different than in the classroom.    i showed up at  urlLink The Meeting House  in Henniker, NH.  She was sitting down with the chef/owner of the resturant to talk about catering services for 25-30 people for a "spiritual conference" coming up in November.  i wanted to ask her what "spiritual conference" meant...but don't know her that well yet.  we got there and the chef/owner was running late, so naomi and i chatted a bit.  when he arrived...it was painless really.  they talked about what his resturant could offer and everything went smoothly.  one thing i notice is that i often hear the english word and can't think of how to translate it into ASL(American Sign Language) so what comes out is english.  afterward i asked naomi for some feedback.  see one word in english came be and mean many things in ASL, so it is tough at that moment to listen to the english, figure out what the hearing person really means, translate it, and produce it all at the same time.  challenging to say the least.

      recently i have witnessed several conversation about our receptionist, mary lou, in our office.  she is a jehovah witness (j-ws).    let me start by explaining that aimee (referral specialist) makes if very clear she has nothing to do with religion.  deb (health advocate/case manager) feels the same way.  susan (excutive director/boss) and connie (video relay specialist) do the 'i go to church' thing, but we all know that doesn't cut it.   mary lou is a great person.  her approach to sharing her faith is not something i agree with totally.  j-ws don't celebrate any holidays.  mary lou will refuse any gifts or greetings related to them.  her two girls don't have birthdays, christmas, easter egg hunts, etc.  she even takes them out of school for holiday parties they are having that day.      yesterday i asked what her girls were doing for the summer and she told me what they do each day of the week.  monday they do...and tuesday we do our religion walk...aka...knocking on people's doors sharing the gospel.  the hairs on the back of my neck started to stand straight up.  she must have told aimee, because later that day...i saw aimee and deb talking about how her young girls go on these religion walks.  they couldn't believe it, continued to laugh about what she believes and what they do when j-ws come to their door.  it was sad really.  (i wonder what they say about me when i am not around)  then today...mary lou received dvds of bible stories in american sign language (ASL).  i just got a brand new dell computer and so my computer was the only one that could play them.  she asked if she could play these religious(i hate that word) dvds to see what they were like.  i wanted to puke.  i couldn't believe she wanted to do this while aimee and deb were standing right there.  she has no idea they talk about her behind her back.  i tried to distract her, but she put it in and we all started watching it.  i kept wondering what aimee and deb must be thinking?!?!  i know i was way uncomfortable.   am i wrong or is she for trying to force this on them?  that is my struggle.  i don't believe knocking on people's door is what god intended.  am i just too passive?  my approach is to be real.  many people don't care if you are a christian or not.  aimee and deb say they are cool if people believe in god and are involved in some sort-of religious group, but don't expect them to join or agree with you.  they are content with what they have and who they are.  what do you do with people like aimee and deb?    i would love your input...  for both miah and i...that is why we struggle with the traditional church.  people like aimee and deb will never step foot in a church building.  there are millions out there just like them.    miah and i started this journey about two years ago.  we prayed and prayed about these thoughts and feelings we were having.  we both grew up 'going to church' and even worked at a  urlLink mega-church .  it is all we know.  now don't get me wrong, the mega-church is a wonderful place to go on sunday, but...something was missing for us.  we experienced a few different ways of doing church and knew god wanted us to start something as simple as inviting people like aimee and deb over for dinner in our home and being real with them.  we find that very few people will say no to a free, home cooked meal and after awhile it becomes a safe environment for them to ask questions and be real with us.  it has been the most difficult, but amazing journey we have ever had.  to read more about what we do, click on ' urlLink river's edge .'    we have a lot to learn and really don't know what we are doing, but when aimee called one day and asked if miah and i wanted to come to a family function with her...we know god is working.  it doesn't have to be at the church building or knocking on their door.  just love on people and through that....god is seen.  the aimee's and debbie's out there will get to experince christ in so many ways if we are REAL!    tell me if i am way off....   know that you are all asleep...i will be close.  i could go on and on.

      #2 move for me... today at work we moved things around.  our boss was gone, so at our staff meeting we started discussing the fact that our office space sucks.  we have one room for seven staff people plus volunteers that come in. it is cramped to say the least and frankly the ugliest office i have ever seen.  it is not the most professional office, so we decided to put one of the dividing wall we have near the front so when people enter all they see is our receptionist and not the huge, ugly office.  (hard to explain)  anyways...moving two times in one week was not so great, but i think the office will function a lot better.  hopefully our boss will think so when she comes in tomorrow.  eek!  #3 flood... i got a page from miah today saying he had fixed the ice machine tube and it was working great.  good news...then i kept reading.  his page says, "i go to slide the dishwasher back in and i noticed my foot is wet.  that's right, i broke the dishwasher line.  i have no idea what i am doing, so i am calling steve."  now i don't have hot water to wash the dishes with till our friend steve comes over to fix it.  miah said that he might be able to come tomorrow, if not...monday.  monday is a long ways away to not be able to wash dishes.  maybe the bathtub will work...

      i just sat down to relax and flipped through the stations on the tv.  "For Love or Money" was one.  i have never seen it, but it was the finale and it sucked me in.  were the women going to choose love or the chance to win one million dollars.  i thought to myself...what would i choose?  how they have it set up...it is all chance.  the guy has two girls to choose from.  he chooses and then that girl chooses whether or not she wants love or money.  if she chooses love...great...they live happily ever after. (doubtful?) if she chooses money, than he can choose to take her money and run or love her forever.    what makes it tough...one of the two girls as a one million dollar check and other has a one dollar check.  none of them know who has what.  in the end...they chose love.  i was shocked.  i think i would have chosen the money.  50/50 chance to having a million dollars.    what would you choose?  now the show after this one is "who will marry may dad?"  it never ends.  why do we get sucked into these shows...these 'reality' shows?  too much.

      first of all, thank you for continuing to think about and pray for my grandad.    the latest update is that he is doing much better.  my dad called me last thursday night and said the doctors do not see any reason to proceed with surgery.  they want to see if they can help him with medicine and continued resting.  it is hard for him to sit and relax.  the week after my grandad had all those heart-attacks and then went to the hospital, my dad offered to pay the neighbor boy down the street to come and mow their lawn.  grandma said she would do it and she did it.  they are a little stubborn to say the least.    anyways, things look promising for him.  he will never be 100%, but hopefully this will pass him some more time with us.  we thought we going to have to bump up our trip this summer to tenn, but we will go as planned in august to visit with them.  i am looking forward to making memories.

      we are moved in.  it is a good feeling to be in a place you know you are suppose to be.  although if you would have seen me last night and this morning...not sure i would have felt the same way.  the move took about three hours and then miah grilled everyone some hamburgers for lunch.  it was a success because we had mike s., bruce s., steven s., jason l., matt and allison k. all there to help us out.  we sent them off and then it was me and miah in our new home.  we know it is "new," but it has felt as if this has been home all along.  it is a perfect fit for us at this time.    BUT...we managed to flood the kitchen once and the basement twice in less than 24 hours.    at our other place we used the landlords washer and dryer, meaning ours sat in their basement until last night.  miah hooked it up and started it just to make sure all was good before we started a load of laundry.  it seemed to be okay so we both went upstairs and continued to work on stuff.  i headed down stairs for something and noticed water all over the floor.  using up all our towels...we finally got it all cleaned up.  we turned the washing machine over to see if we could find the problem, but the whole thing was wet...not a good sign.  it was late so we decided to mess with it in the morning.    and then the second flood occurred...  this morning miah woke up around 5am.  i slept in and woke up to miah telling me not to go into the kitchen.  it was covered in water because the tube going from the sink to the ice machine in our freezer decided it needed to welcome us in to our new home.  we didn't know we had one of those and when water is coming from behind the stove...it is hard to know what to do to fix it.  miah finally realized it was attached to the ice machine and shut it off as well as the electricity (stove now covered with water because the water was spraying everywhere).  the water managed to make its way down the wall and to the basement floor as well.  now remember our washer and dryer is not hooked up yet and due to the flood the night before and the mess...we have no clean, dry towels to wipe up this mess with.  it was an adventure and i got a little stressed out.    if you know miah and i well...you know we are not handy people.  it is scary to not have mr. landlord come fix the problems and then pay for it.  it is just miah and myself in charge of fixing and paying for it all.  what were we thinking?    other than those two crazy adventures...things have been great.  i get overwhelmed with what each room needs to complete it, but we are sticking to "one room at a time."

      scary to think about...  yesterday we closed on our new place.  my hand hurt from signing my name so many times.  i don't think i will forget my name now.  both our realtor (he gave us a nice yankee candle and a $50 gift card to Home Depot)and mortgage guy (friend of ours)came and it was really painless, until i had to write a massive check...EEK!!!  (never wrote one that big before)    we met the couple we bought it from and they had nothing but nice things to say about the place and the neighbors around us.  there is an older couple and one other man in charge of the outside maintenance stuff and again nothing but nice things about them.  they will come as soon as you call if there are any problems, etc.  it was so comforting you hear that.  i also met a neighbor of ours and he told me he had lived in these townhouses for 10 years.  wow.  he was really nice and told me we will love it here.    miah and i started taking stuff over yesterday.  our big moving day is tomorrow.  the cable/internet was hooked up yesterday.  i cleaned the cabinets out in the kitchen.  just little stuff really.  we realized the place will need painted.  with all their stuff in it...it didn't look bad at all.  it looks dirty and so we have to pick out some colors.  that is stressful for me.  any suggestions?  last night we were pooped...so we went to the movie "Spiderman 2."  loved it.  loved it. loved it.  you must go see it.  i have never been into the comic book scene, but i now own over 3,000 comic books due to being married to miah.  we just can't get rid of them...smile.  (love you, miah)  anyways...this movie is worth it...but you must see the first one as well.    well...i am at work and should get back.  we are closing early today since it is a holiday weekend.  what is everyone's plans for the 4th?  we, of course, are moving and getting settled.  leave me a comment and let me know.  have a great, long weekend.

      yesterday was my birthday. miah gave me an early b-day present on thursday or friday and i have been addicted ever since. my two sisters have been addicted for a long time now and i would tease them about it, until i played it myself and can't stop!!! it is 'The Sims'. if you don't know what that is...probably a good thing. if you do...you know how addicting it is. i have no idea what i am doing though...so my person i created hates me. she often just falls down and sleeps on the floor, cuz i work her to death...no time for sleep. hehe.  then miah told me we were going to go to six flags for my birthday with some friends of ours. the hurricane didn't quite corporate though...it rained yesterday, so what was the back up plan?!?!   urlLink IKEA!!!!   people don't know what that is out here. such a shame. at the end of july they opened one up in connecticut, so we went. i was loving every second. miah and i and our friends, matt and allison drove down to shop, shop, shop. (the boys loved it...hehe...especially since we were there for over 5 hours) so crowded! after roaming around and writing a list of everything we wanted, we had to sit and decide what are we really going to get today. so miah and i decided to buy an entertainment center, coffee table, and end table for our living room. we also got a few little things as well for the bathroom. we were wicked excited. big investment, but you have to love IKEAs prices.  it was a great day. thank you to matt and miah for hanging in there with the wives. you are troopers.  we had a great time with matt and allison. we met them through ann winans (allison and ann taught at nashua high school when ann was out here). they are a great couple. thank you ann for introducing us. we were talking last night, if you wouldn't have introduced us...we would have probably never met. what is funny...allison and matt went to valpo in indiana and know a couple of people miah and i went to high school with back in IL...small world.

      yesterday miah, me and chewy went up to newfound lake to visit some friends of ours from idaho. her father started a christian camp out here call  urlLink camp berea  years ago and his family is from vermont, so every summer they come out for several weeks to see the grandparents and have fun on the lake. (it took me back to my childhood yesterday when all the kids were playing in the lake and boating. that childhood doesn't seem real to me. that was before dad left and those memories faded so quickly. it was a little emotional for me to return to good times when dad was around.)  what a great family. they have four kids, zion (girl), thunder (boy), febe (girl) and little three-year-old zachary (girl). what fun names, huh? their family is part of a church similar to river's edge is out there in idaho. they are so much wiser and cooler than us though...i promise. to read more about them click on their names.  urlLink Eric Keck  and  urlLink Beth Keck . it is worth your time.  we were encouraged yesterday.

      last night we went to go see the new tommy movie with jamie fox, "collateral,'  with aimee from work and her hubby.   i won't say much about the movie, incase you haven't seen it, but wow!  you either like or you don't.  not your typical tom cruise movie that is for sure.  curious to know if you went and saw it what you think?

      marylou comes up a lot at work, because other staff do not understand where she is coming from as far as her religion goes.  one topic that they just don't understand is why j-ws don't celebrate all holidays, including birthdays.  they brought it up today and deb asked...do christians celebrate holidays?  i told her of course.  then she asked, "what is the difference between christians and born-again christians?"  oh boy!  her aunt says she is a born-again christian and deb, growing up catholic, doesn't understand what she means.  so we talked a little bit about what i believe the difference is, but i get so nervous with these conversations.  my fear is that i would rather them not know, then me give them the wrong information.  then if my answer is not enough and they keep going...will i know the answers?  and aimee was there for the conversation as well.  (read below to know where aimee comes from.)  i am such a winnie-head.  i hate that about myself.  why does it for some people come so natural to share about their faith and others...not?  people like my husband love these types of conversations with people.  i steer away.  why do i?

                         marylou is probably in her 40 ’ s and they just built and now own their first home ever. As you know miah and I just bought our first place to, so her and I have been talking about colors, decorations, etc.    I told her that I have always wanted a red kitchen, but can ’ t seem to find the right red as far as paint goes.    She told me that I should stop by after work to see her kitchen … it is red.    I really didn ’ t have a good excuse not to.    Miah was away, all I was going home to was an unfinished living room calling my name to finish painting it.    So I told her I would.                     She knows what miah and I are doing with River ’ s Edge and my background a little, so ever since then, she is eager to have me over and  “ talk Bible ”  as she says.    Fearful she would corner me into a conversation about the  ‘ bible ’ , I prayed on the way there and god told me he was on my side, so I knew then … I could do this.                     I get there and grandpa and her hubby were outside on the back porch, sitting there drinking some wine.    (huge Italian family)    marylou was peeling potatoes for dinner.    Her mother was over early and put a roast in for dinner. it was neat to see a family together like that.    It made me miss mine like CRAZY!    Marylou showed me around her place and then we went back outside to chat a little.    I fell in love with grandpa.    He was so chatty and cute.    He asked me most of the get-to-know-you questions people do.    I wanted to stay all night.    It was fun to hang out with a family again.    Marylou has two cute daughters, Erika and whitney.    They were there as well, and it was really nice.                     Marylou ’ s hubby, john, did ask the question, I will admit, is hard for me to answer sometimes … what does your husband do?    It is not that I don ’ t support what he does or that I don ’ t want to answer it, but it is so new to people, it can be hard to express/explain.    Plus I thought … this could start the  ‘ bible talk. ’     So I briefly mentioned what we did at MCC and how they sent us to start new churches in   manchester  .    Then they thought miah built churches.    If you think about it … we do … but they meant church buildings.    So I explained I little more in detail what river ’ s edge is all about.    They loved the idea.    I heard marylou say,  “ that is so fascinating. ”     And that was it.    Whew!    (I reread this and realized for some of you who haven ’ t been reading all my blogs … Marylou ’ s family are jehavoh witnesses)                 When I got there I noticed they had a parakeet.    It was just hanging out on the table (no cage) with the fam.    Eventually it jumped onto my lap.    My keys were sitting in my lap and it played with them for a while and then decided to crawl up my arm and sit on my shoulder.     Okay … this was a little crazy for me.    I had two of these birds growing up and I killed both.    Plus I didn ’ t know this bird … was it going to eat my ear off, poop on me … what?    Marylou asked if I was okay.    I smile and say …’ it is fine. ’     So we start chatting again and all of I sudden I hear this voice, but it wasn ’ t one of them.    it was too quick for me to figure out what it was, so I just ignored it and carried on in the conversation.    I heard it again … this time I understood what it said.    I was wicked confused, but still didn ’ t want to say anything.    Didn ’ t want them to think I was psycho.    The third time … I had enough.    I asked … does this bird talk?    They all started laughing.    It was a talking bird … but the problem was … no joke … it sounded like a truck driver.    Now what that sounds like … I don ’ t know, but that is the only thing I can compare it to.    When you think of these types of birds … they tend to have a high pitched chirping noise.    That was what throw me.    It would chirp high like they are suppose to, but when it talked … low, man, trucker voice.    It was the strangest thing.    John taught the bird to talk, so it mimics his low voice.    It said,  “ I am Ceasar (his name) ” ,  “ want some wine (the bird actually drank wine out of their glasses while I was there), and  “ look at me. ”     It has many things it says, but that was the only thing I got.                 Needless to say … I don ’ t know, but I like to think god used the bird to distract the conversation so we could just laugh together that night and hang out.    I know it will come where we will have the  “ bible talk, ”  but he knew.    He knew that I wasn ’ t comfortable going there and that I need support when it comes to conversations about theology and the bible with people like Jehovah witnesses.    I am as simple as it comes.    My faith is simple and I don ’ t get into the deep stuff/conversations like I should.    But that is where my hubby comes in.    he is geared up that way and we are a good team.    He helps me to think more deeply and I help him to stop making things so complicated and analyzing/thinking so much.    Heehee.                     I do look forward to our conversation one of these days.    god may your words come out of my mouth that day.

      when our office is closed either aimee or i wear an emergency pager. when a deaf person is in need of an interpreter asap, the pager will go off and we look for an interpreter to go.  even though our office was open, the pager went off this afternoon. aimee was on the phone, so i called 911 and they told me a hospital called and need an interpreter. they gave me the contact person and number to call. i called the hospital and the woman on the other end told me that a young, deaf, high school student in the area has just entered the ER dept. we have to ask what the nature of the situation is, so we can inform the interpreter going what they are getting ready to do. my heart fell to the ground when the woman said, "he was raped."  we found an interpreter to go and my job was done, but i found myself crying all the way home tonight. my heart is heavy. i have no idea the details of this situation, but i can't imagine this happening and then on top of it...being deaf. this young boy goes to the hospital and has to wait an hour or so for the interpreter to arrive before he can clearly communicate what is going on with him. i can imagine the cops and doctors there are talking to him, thinking he can understand by reading their lips, but he can't. deaf people read about 30% and assume what you are saying the other 70%. it makes me sick to think of what he is going through right now. no privacy. deaf people always have someone else knowing their personal live, if they choose to have interpreters involved. interpreters have a tough job. this poor boy.  so what do i do when i am sad...call my mother. mom was at work, but she told me she was emailing me sad news. i told her i can't take anymore sad news. after i shared my unexpected news, she shared that last night one of my brother's friend's dad died unexpectedly. he had a terrible fall at work and went to the hospital. i guess they had to do surgery immediately and there were complication and he passed on. my brother was there at the hospital when he passed. he was there to support his friend and experienced a death. wow. mom told me when she went home today at lunch time, my brother gave her a big hug and didn't let go. so sorry buddy...i am thinking and praying for you and your friend's family. i love you so much.  tell/show someone you love them today and everyday.  you never know when unexpected news will come your way.  i love you all so much.

      who am i to judge someone else's sin?  this question was stated by a FORMER classmate last night.  last night i had a meeting at work. i am on the board of the New Hampshire Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (NHRID) and someone mentioned one of the teachers at UNHM (I just graduated from there) got married. great for him, but he chose to marry another man. i also work with someone who chooses to be with another woman. my co-worker is not married to her partner yet, but it could happen and i know the office staff will be invited. miah and i found out recently that a classmate from Lincoln Christian College has choosen to be with another man. i know a young girl here in NH that attends Manchester Christian Church who has been tempted with being with another woman. it is all around us.  i have been pondering this for awhile now. my co-worker is an amazing deaf woman. she is so fun, so crazy, so intelligent, so...so...so! i love her. our office wouldn't be the same without her. in the back of my head though...i remember she chooses to love another woman.  this is hard for me to share. i have shared my thoughts with miah, but last night i shared some thoughts with my FORMER classmate who attends a local church here in NH. she has also struggled with this.  we were taught that being with the same sex is wrong. what happens when we are taught something is bad/wrong...we judge others that partake in this 'thing.'  so i loved what my friend said. "who am i to judge another person's sin?" it is so true. i am to love all...no matter what. how is my sin any better or worse than someone else's? it is not! we each are responsible for our own choices. we each answer to HIM in the end. let HIM do the judging...  the toughest part for me is BALANCE. (i have sat here and tried to figure out how to explain this. i keep typing and then erasing it. let me keep thinking about what i mean. )
