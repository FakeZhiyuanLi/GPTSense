      Fr. Smith's Sermon Sunday September 21  Last Sunday, Episcopal School Sunday, it was great to see so many of our parish day school children among us:  reading the lessons and Gospel, serving God at the altar, greeting people at the door as ushers.  There were four student ushers stationed at the front door and I had baptized each one of them!  It blew my mind to think that now these children, whom we had welcomed into the household of God, were themselves welcoming people into the church! 	In God’s loving way with us, it is no surprise to me that last Sunday, where children were the highlight and center, is followed by this Sunday’s Gospel reading of Jesus, who, overhearing  his disciples arguing about who was the greatest among them, set a child in the midst of his disciples to teach them, and now us, something most important about our following of Him.  And that something is humility:  being so sure of  who we are as God’s children that we can let go of personal prerogative and the judging of others.  In the eyes of many appearing weak, but in the Kingdom, finding real strength and the door to true peace in this world. 	“It is impossible to overestimate the value of true humility and its power in the spiritual life.  For the beginning of humility is the beginning of blessedness and the consummation of  humility is the perfection of all joy.  Humility contains in itself the answer to all the great problems of the life of the soul.  It is the only key to faith, with which the spiritual life begins:  for faith and humility are inseparable . . . If we were incapable of humility, we would be incapable of joy because humility alone can destroy the self-centeredness that makes joy impossible . . . A humble person is not afraid of anything . . . Since perfect humility implies perfect confidence in the power of God, before whom no other power has any meaning and for whom there is no such thing as an obstacle.  Humility is the surest sign of strength.”  (Merton, Seeds of Contemplation) 	If there is one virtue that we can open to in our day when we so easily are disturbed by scandals in peoples lives (sometimes our own!), the church, and the concentric worlds that surround us, that virtue is humility.  Jesus knew that humility was a foundation virtue for his disciples and for everyone that would follow and serve him.  Jesus emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, for our salvation.   	Humility is the key to all the other virtues especially faith, hope, and love.  Think about it:  How many people can’t open to the gift of faith in Christ because they won’t accept any Lord over their lives but themselves, or, are tripped up (that really is what scandal means) by something in the church that caused them sadness (like seeing Jesus’ disciples argue about who the greatest one was!).  Only the letting go of personal prerogative and the judging of others which is humility is the only way to open to faith in such a person.   	But how can humility as a foundation virtue lead beyond faith to hope and love?  This is very important, because humility can not be turned on and off like a switch.  We think:  Oh boy, now I’m going to be humble!  Everyone will see my humility and think I’m great (which I am really).  Such “chosen” humility is truly only skin deep!  One little thing happens to bring turbulence to our “humble scenario” and we’re off and running with disgust, anger, and a “I’m outta here”. 	Humility that is turned on and off is, to borrow a word from Wisdom this morning, “convenient”, but it is always false.  A humble person can live with lots of inconvenience.  False humility, on the other hand, is the breeding ground for all the problems James is talking about (James 3:16ff.)  But if humility can’t be turned off and on, where can we get it?  We must, as in everything, look to Jesus.   	Jesus spoke to his heavenly Father in childlike, trustful and intimate way.  Just like a child with his or her father or mother.  The secret to humility is learning to say “Abba”.  This is what children say so easily.  All they have is complete trust in mommy and daddy.  What Jesus is teaching is that in order to enter the Kingdom of God you have to learn to live “Abba”, to become again like a child:  living in simple trust every minute of the day, in everything.  Here and now.  A child has very little tendency to live in the past or future.  For the child the past hurts and future expectations are overshadowed by the present.  With no ingrained anticipations or apprehensions the child does not demand that things happen one way or another.  The living out of an utter trust in God is the beginning of real conversion and the experience of living with Abba God in childlike confidence, safe under his protection and conscious always (with our very next thought) of his tremendous love is the direct fruit of humility. 	So the Good News this morning is that each of us is invited by means of this simple story to recognize once again that in the last analysis we cannot save ourselves, and, freed by our Father’s love for us, we can accept and choose to put our trust in God as a loving parent.  It is paradoxical, but someone who really a sense of their own worth, who can deal with a diversity of people, can cope with all the curves that are thrown in life, who in many ways is strong and successful adult, should freely choose to rely on the Father’s love.  This is holy humility.  This is what it is like in the Kingdom.  This is our way if we choose to accept the “Abba-nature” infused in us by the Holy Spirit and  take the radical step of being changed, as the first disciples were challenged to do, to live as child-servants of God.

      Fr. Smith's Sermon Sunday October 19th  “The word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul from spirit, joints from marrow; it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.” (Heb.4:12)  	I’m happy to announce to you that we have a new bishop in the Diocese of Arizona.  Canon Kirk Smith was elected and I believe that this person will be a excellent chief shepherd for us and lead us through the difficult times in which we live and help us all to minister faithfully in Jesus’ name.  The election of the bishop brought back to mind a question that a wise Monsignor once posed to a group of newly ordained priests:  You have to make a decision--do you want to be a bishop or a priest?--and that decision will affect the rest of your life.  Now, the old Monsignor wasn’t trying to be critical of all bishops, for obviously there are many fine ones--hopefully the one we just elected.  What he was getting at is that a priest has to decide whether he or she is going to be a careerist or a servant of the least and that decision will influence the rest of life and what kind of priest the person will be.  Hopefully, Kirk Smith, who we just elected, decided years ago he wanted to be a servant priest and was totally surprised by the Holy Spirit in this election!    	And we can’t just pose the Monsignor’s question only to priests and bishops only, for we live in a time when the ministry of each baptized person is valued as essential for the mission of the church.  If it is the case that some who begin as fine servant priests gradually get drawn to an upward, hierarchical career track, the same can be true for some lay persons for fall into the same error of clericalism, trading their servant role in for their own needs for importance and power in the church.  When this happens it becomes hard to find out what anybody believes in:  God? Their Role?  Or Power?  	Both our election of Bishop and today’s gospel bring this discussion of servant hood to the forefront.  In the Gospel, James and John boldly approach Jesus, within earshot of the other disciples, and ask Jesus to do something for them.  “What do you want me to do for you?“  Jesus asks.  “Give us the highest places in your future Kingdom” they reply.  When all the other apostles hear this they are upset and start arguing among themselves.  Now the Apostles are portrayed in the Gospels as basically good people, nevertheless, we see them as ambitious, concerned with power, and their own backside.  Jesus takes this encounter as a chance to teach them about true greatness.  True greatness is found only in service and the high places in Kingdom will be given to the one who serves the needs of all especially those considered the  least.  Jesus explains that He has come not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for sinners.  Jesus is the righteous  Servant Isaiah foretold who would make many righteous and bear the iniquities of many and make intercession for transgressors.  	Last week Fr. Daniel spoke of the “stuff” that can keep us from serving God and at the same time cut us off from our brothers and sisters.  This week the teaching from the gospel is about power.  The desire for power can have the same negative effect.  When service is the motivation of our lives it will bring us into close personal contact with many of our brothers and sisters in the human family.  But when power is the motivation for our lives we will find ourselves distanced from one another and the needs of our brothers and sisters.  A life devoted to power disconnects us from both God and other people.  	As Jesus watched the power struggles of his own chosen apostles, I think he is watching the struggle that is going on in our denomination today especially around the election of the first “openly gay”  cleric to be elected in the Apostolic order.  The division is great between some good and faithful people on both sides of the issue.  While the main disagreement is claimed to around “faithfulness to scripture”, what if at root it is a question of power in the church?  Faithful and committed Episcopalians elected Fr. Robinson bishop.  Why?  Some think it was just because he was Gay and in a committed relationship for a number of years.  I really don’t think this is the case.  I think rather that our brothers and sisters in New Hampshire and at convention saw in this man a “servant first” mentality and a servant leader who never in a million years thought he would ever be elected to serve as bishop.  He has been such a Good Shepherd to those he has served over the years in “small” daily differences that it was this ministry that made the “big” difference of his election and confirmation.  And this “Good Shepherd” quality of his life, acknowledged by those closest to him, adheres Gene Robinson to the “scriptural norm” of righteousness.    	Let us be at peace about this matter and see what come of this.  Remember the story of Gamaliel in the Acts of the Apostles?  The disciples were preaching and teaching in Jesus’ name and get thrown into jail.  In the middle of the night an Angel comes and lets them out.  The next morning they are preaching and teaching again non-stop.  They are arrested for a second time and brought before the Council of the Jews where they are ordered to stop.  They respond:  “We must obey God rather than any human authority.”  The Council wanted to have them all put to death, but a wise member of the Council, a Pharisee named Gamaliel stood up and had the followers of Jesus put out of the chamber for a short time.  He then told the council something that I think applies to Gene Robinson’s election and the disturbing movement it portends for some in the church.  Gamaliel reminded the Council about a certain Theudas and his 400 hundred men who rose up, aspiring to be somebody.  However, Theudas was killed and his whole movement died with him.  And the same thing happened with another  Judas of  Galilee and his followers.  Gamaliel made his point:  So in the present case, I tell you . . . Let them alone; because if this plan or this understanding is of human origin, it will fail; but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them--in that case you may even be found fighting against God! (Acts 5:38-39)  The wisdom of Gamaliel prevailed, at least for the Jews. 	 	So we can lift up our hearts.  God reigns and is in control.  And God’s purposes will be accomplished if we let go of petty struggles for power and become servants of one another and this means servants of Christ  whose image we bear.  “Are you able to drink the cup that I drink? Or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?  The disciples answer “We are able.”  But they don’t really understand what Jesus is asking:  Are you ready to be a servant?  To lay down your life in a million different ways so that my Kingdom of love will prevail in this world?  Jesus asks the same question of us this morning.  And two thousand years later, it’s hard for us to say we don’t understand.  Our answer may come slower than those first disciples, but hopefully the answer  will be:  we will serve, we will give our lives, we will be the slave of all, and in doing all this we will help God’s Kingdom come.

       ST. MICHAEL AND ALL ANGELS' LABYRINTH  - take time to visit the Labyrinth in the courtyard near the parish Center.       The design of St. Michael's Labyrinth is modeled after the one located in the floor at Chartres Cathedral near Paris, France.  The Labyrinth at Chartres was built around 1200 and is laid into the floor in a style sometimes referred to as a pavement maze and is walked as a pilgrimage and/or for repentance.  As a pilgrimage, it was a questing, searching journey with the hope of becoming closer to God.  When used for repentance, the pilgrims would walk on their knees.  Sometimes this eleven-circuit Labyrinth would serve as a substitute for an actual pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and as a result, came to be called the "Chemin de Jerusalem" or Road of Jerusalem.       In walking the Labyrinth, the walker meanders through each of the four quadrants several times before reaching the goal.  An expectancy is created as to when the center will be reached.  At the center is a rosette design which has a rich symbolic value including that of enlightenment.  This is where the individual is invited to mediate.  You will notice the four arms of the cross are readily visible which provides significant Christian symbolism and also includes a Baptismal pool.       Come walk the Labyrinth--come experience a  walking meditation -- every Monday morning starting at 8:00 AM with Fr. John Smith.    A NEW TESTAMENT GREEK CLASS FOR LAY PEOPLE  to continues every Wednesday at 8:45 AM in the Parish Center.  Fr. Smith will be teaching an Inductive approach to the Gospel of John.  There is a $35 workbook fee for this class.  For those interested, please call the church office at 886-7292 or email to church@stmichael.net   YOUNG ADULT BIBLE STUDY AND POTLUCK  continues Wednesday evenings at 6:30 PM following Evening Prayer.

      The  English Faire  on September 27th was a great success!  Thanks to all the Mayors, Sheriffs, and Town Criers and citizens who helped welcome so many to our church and school campus.  We can forget “King” Karl MacOmber who guided the effort and Alicia Basemann, our parish administrator who provided support.  The food offered at the Faire was delicious:  fish n’ chips, bangers and mash, and shepherd’s pie.  Thank you Joy Miller, Andy Bruno, and all your helpers!  The Episcopal Church Women had a wonderful, sold-out tea!  And Amy Bruno won the beautiful PT Cruiser donated by Steve Christy Chrysler Jeep- she really deserved to win as the tip-top seller of over 60 tickets!  The English Faire effort netted $5,200 for our Habitat for Humanity House and the PT raffle made $25,000 for the Peace of Mind Organ fund.  Thanks again to everyone who participated in our Faire!!  The 10:00am  Patronal Mass to St. Michael and All Angels on Sunday , September 28th  was beautiful.  Our choir sang the Schubert Mass supported with orchestra and timpani.  Thank you Jane Haman, choir director and organist, for all your efforts to make this a special celebration.  Daniel Richards, our transitional Deacon, preached a  message that since Michael, our Patron, has the sword and scales of justice, we can trust God and put away our own swords and judgments which divide us from so many of our brothers and sisters.  On that same Sunday afternoon at the Tucson Community Center four parishioners and Fr. Smith attended the  “Families First”  agenda rally sponsored by the Pima County Interfaith Council.  Mayoral and City Council candidates responded to the agenda which strongly supported the need to fund programs for families like KIDCO, JobPath, and an eastside Adult Education facility.  Program funding has been cut sharply and needs to be restored.  Formerly at no or little cost, programs like KIDCO are now charging fees that are prohibitive for many families and require them to register with a credit or debit card which many low-income families do not have.  Attendance in this afternoon program has been dropping.  Idleness after school while parents work leads to crime.  Prioritizing city funds away from flashy studies and projects could make these programs thrive again.  Register and vote.  Registration is offered after services on Sunday.  Sunday, October 5, saw many animals of all shapes and sizes, gathered at Mass with their owners for the blessing of the animals in honor of  St. Francis .  Fr. Smith shared how Francis lived in time much like we do:  constant warfare, political scheming, and tremendous cruelty of people to one another and especially animals.  In this context he opened himself to the grace of conversion which enabled him to embrace absolute poverty and the Gospel message of repentance, love, and reconciliation.  Great stories are told of his reconciling a terrorizing Wolf with the townspeople of Gubbio and the harmony and love that ensued.  Another story told of Francis and his brothers joining the 5th Crusade in 1219 in Damietta where untold crusaders and muslims lost their lives.  Walking through the line of battle, armed with nothing but the Gospel message of love, Francis was allowed an audience with the Moslem Sultan Malek al-Kamil.  The mighty Sultan could have had Francis’ head in a second, but he was so impressed with Francis’ sincerity and message of love for God that he gave Francis and his brothers a letter of safe passage to the Holy Land which was the goal of the whole crusade whose blood thirst in God’s Name made arrival there impossible!  Can we pray for the grace to, like Francis, arm ourselves with nothing but Jesus in our world of constant warring, political intrigue, and cruelty and build a new relationship with God’s natural, animal, and human creation.  Make us channels of God’s peace!

       Fr. Smith's Sermon, Sunday, November 16                   These next four weeks, two as we end the church year and the first two Sundays of Advent, we deal with the end of  the world and the second coming of Christ.  Today readings introduce the coming of Christ at the end climatic time of the Great Tribulation.  Now we can think about all this as years, or even hundreds of years away- not in our lifetime at all.  But isn’t it the truth that some people are experiencing great tribulation in their lives right this very minute?  I’m talking about people who have suffered massively from fire and natural disasters, warfare, murders, famine, floods, refugee migration, and sometimes losing everything.  When these things happen to you and the people that you love it is great tribulation and it is the end of the world as you know it. 	Jesus isn’t trying to play a guessing game with his disciples:  who can guess when the end will come?  Then, in his day, all along the history of the world, and in our own time, Jesus knew there will be times of great tribulation and distress.  And when the great tribulation that effects your life or mine hits-- the big question is whether we will be awake or asleep?  Are we prepared with a knowledge of God’s love and care for us that gives us the hope and endurance we need or have we in subtle or not-so-subtle ways postponed knowing God?  Are we people of faith in name only or people of commitment and deep trust in God’s providence over our lives?  These relevant questions are being forced on us these days--even if “tribulation” seems to have bypassed us. 	The scriptures for today are a type of literature called “apocalyptic”.  It’s the loud unexpected knock on the door or the telephone ringing in the middle of the night causing your heart to skip a beat.  It’s the jumping out of bed and your feet touching the cold floor.  It being forced to leave your warm bed and covers.  Apocalyptic is a call to wake up to spiritual reality which when it comes down to it is the most real of all.  What we call Reality TV is a joke compared to what apocalyptic is all about. 	All of us experienced “apocalyptic” on September 11.  The world as we knew it was changed in a matter of minutes.  An acquaintance of mine wrote about her apocalyptic experience of that fateful day.  	                “Since September 11, we’re all insecure, frightened, and fearful.  If it happened once, it could happen again, at any time.  Since then, we’re all struggling to define ourselves and our culture in new ways, taking into account what used to be unthinkable. 	The scriptural images of the end of the world used to seem alien.  Apocalyptic visions seemed to apply to something long ago and far away.  Now, our global village smaller, with so much news from the Middle East, the images from Scripture seem somehow to be coming very close to our lives with wars and rumors of wars in places with biblical names seeming right next door! 	Holy wars in the Holy Land aren’t just long ago and far away, and now colonial occupation of biblical places has me smack-dab in the middle of apocalyptic events--even if I don’t choose or didn’t choose to be there.  What used to be “there” is here, wherever I live.” 	Whew!  I said to myself when I read what she wrote a couple of weeks ago.  This is how I’m feeling too.  Maybe you feel the same way.  What are we going to do about it? 	First off, it is a perfect time to make a solid act of faith.  When things look bleakest in the world around us, when there is no hope for a purely human solution:  do everything  possible to live in faith. 	When we finally realize what scripture has been trying to tell us all along:  That the present age is under the dominion of Satan, the world is up to its neck with unrighteousness, that the righteous, even twenty Mother Teresas, are powerless to redeem the situation we find ourselves in and there is no prospect for improvement.  The only way out--the only hope we have for salvation the way things are going-- is for the Holy God to intervene.  Do you have that “apocalyptic” feeling? 	For me, this feeling engenders not more fear, but hope.  Satan is not the opposite of God.  God has no opposite.  The opposite of Satan is Michael, the Archangel, our patron.  Appearances to the contrary, notwithstanding, God is in control, God reigns!   	The Day of the Lord is coming when all the plans and architecture of this present age will be supplanted by the rule of God.  Nothing in our human dimension is permanent.  Not our country, not the Constitution.  Not the Supreme Court.  Not the National Cathedral or this church, a symbol of God’s presence in our midst.  None of these things have survival value.  Everything we take for granted as center-pieces of our culture and community, in education, government, religion, and economics, will pass away.  Only one thing has survival value in this world and the next:  love.  	So instead of hiding our heads in virtual sand, or giving up all responsibility for this world and just sit around and wait for Jesus to return--  we are called to stay awake and pay attention to everything happening around us with love.   Now I was hoping that this Sunday’s readings would lead to a consideration of stewardship at this time of year when we make our commitment for the coming year.  If the call is to wake up, then Stewardship, taking responsibility before God for how we use our time, talents, and money keeps us awake like nothing else can and effectively helps us to pay attention in love to what God is doing in our lives, community, and the world.   	This week I came across some research by Esther Harding, a personologist and author of a book entitled The I and the Not I.  It contains a scientific study about the consciousness of animals.  The scientists discovered that an animal sees and hears only what concerns itself and is insensitive to all else.  Every animal, in other words, lives in a world of its own. 	The study examines the life of a little creature called a wood-tick, which, at certain times in its life cycle, needs the blood of warm-blooded animals in order to reproduce.  The wood-tick attaches itself to the bark of trees and waits for a host animal to pass by.  With many ticks in the woods and far fewer warm-blooded animals to walk by, the wait for some wood-ticks has been as long as 17 years!  During this time there is nothing else that meets the need of the tick, and nothing else to which it responds.    	Hardy, who takes this study and applies it to her work as a personologist, says that even though humans have a higher consciousness than “lower animals,” this enclosed world view persists in the human day to day environment as well.   We tend to see only what concerns us or meets our needs.  And we tend to turn off, or ignore, those things which we deem irrelevant to our situation. 	All of this speaks to our own consciousness of the “end times” and the wisdom of living awake and sober as good stewards of all God has put into our hands.  We might like to stay warm in bed under the covers of unconsciousness, or sit in a piece of bark waiting for life to come to us, but then along comes this Gospel wake-up call to come alive to the world, the living God who created it all, and the church which he called into being, and whatever happens, we are never to despair. 	I know what some of you might be thinking.  Smith’s sermon can be summarized in one sentence:  Stewardship leads to the end of  the world!  Cute, I agree, but what if its true?  Just think of who is coming at the end of the world- being a good steward makes a lot of sense!

       A reflection on the Gospel, Sunday, October 26th by Fr. Smith   Sometimes if we really want to "see" or understand something we have take the most radical and trusting step of faith first.  Bartimaeus, a blind begger, is squating, begging for alms, and hoping that the pilgrims heading for the Passover celebration in Jerusalem will throw a coin or two into his cloakfolded over his legs.  He knows all the best places to beg, and though blind, has survived relatively well over the years.    Bartimaeus' blindness has heightened his sense of hearing.  He doesn't miss much of what is going on around him.  He has heard that one Jesus or Nazareth is soon to pass by, and when he does he cries out:  Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.  The crown around him tells him to b quiet, but he continues to cry out to Jesus.  And Jesus stops!  Jesus calls for Bartimaeus to come to him.  Bartimaeus jumps up and runs to Jesus    leaving behind his cloak!  .  This is a very significant detail in the story.  The cloak kept Bartimaeus warm at night and was the collecting point for the alms he received.  It was probably one of his few possessions and leaving it behind as a blind person he would never find it again in the confusion of the great crowd heading for Jerusalem.  Seeing his faith and perceiving that Bartimaeus was ready, Jesus asks him the question he asked others:  What do you want me to do for you?  Bartimaeus had left everything- he could have asked for monetary help, but instead he asks that he might regain his sight.  Jesus instantly gives him back his sight.  The story concludes with Bartimaeus following Jesus "on the way" as the newest disciple!    All Saints celebration November 2nd-  a reflection by Fr. Smith    St. Michael and All Angels church and school celebrates a "full" liturgical calendar remembering each Saint and Anglican hero as their day comes along.  But at All Saints we remember the "rank and file" folk "just like you and me" who are baptized in the faith and whose deeds of love and mercy over the years are largely unheralded.  There are no natural-born christians.  There is no such thing as christian DNA.  Surely loved by God from the moment of our conception, each of us still has to be introduced to Jesus Christ the Lord of life.  The everyday "saints" our the ones who have done this for us and it is these we celebrate on the Feast of All Saints!  The "saints" we're giving thanks for today have dents in their halos for sure.  They merit the name saint not because they are free from imperfection, but because they tried to imitate Jesus in their lives.  St. Paul refers to "saints" in all his letters to the churches and chides those same people at times for their wilfulness, quarelsome,  self-serving ways, as well as their sexual irresponsibility.  But they are still "saints".  Even St. Paul,  after  his conversion confesses "I don't understand my own actions.  The very things I do not want to do, I do.  And the things I do want to do I don't do."  The children we baptized on All Saints are "canonized" into the joyful following of the Lord.  They will need their families, friends, and the witness all of us to come to know Jesus Christ and the happiness this relationship brings.  And when life brings sorrow, as it surely does at times, Jesus will be the One who will wipe away every tear from their eyes.

      Resolutions for the New Year that will probably work:  Fr. Smith's Sermon for Second Sunday after Christmas  When I was called to serve in this diocese in 1987 my first assignment was St. Michael’s in Coolidge and Christ Church in Florence.  On my days off, Kathleen, the kids, and me would sometimes come to Tucson to shop.  I remember going down Wilmot in those days and seeing the Sign in front of the parish:  It’s a sin to build a nuclear bomb!  Almost eight years later, when I came to this parish, the Sign had been changed to:  Jesus was a refugee.  The idyllic scene of the Christmas story and crèche didn’t last very long.  The picture on the prophetic sign was of the Holy Family, Joseph leading Mary and the child Jesus on a donkey as they fled to Egypt.  And they stayed in Egypt around six or seven years before God-inspired dreams guided Joseph to bring his family to settle down in Nazareth. 	All of this divine guidance and moving around was due to Herod’s slaughter of innocent children two years old or younger.  Just ten days from the Christmas celebration we are given a stark reminder that the plan of our redemption always involves suffering and death.  As T.S.Elliot wrote.  In his end was his beginning.  Remember the question to Jesus:  Are you a king?  Herod orders the death sentence of innocent children to end the threat to his earthly kingship.  Then, as in our own day, the ones who suffer most in this world are innocent children, gassed at Auschwitz, napalmed in Vietnam, starved to death in Africa, always at the hands of fear, greed, and power.  The ancient story repeats itself over and over again, “wailing and loud lamentation are heard in Ramah, Rachel is weeping for her children.” 	The question that we wrestle with:  Where is God when innocents suffer?  This is the scandalous question which plagues us and yet is answered during the season of the Incarnation we are celebrating.  The answer is that God is never far off at all.  God is so close to us, in fact, that God has become one of us in Jesus, a human being born into poverty, rejected by respectable people, and executed as a criminal.  In Jesus, God meets us at the very core of our suffering.  Any pain that the world can manufacture will ultimately be swallowed up in God’s compassionate and gracious love. 	In the Gospel today there are no less than three occasions where God’s presence in a dream resulted in deliverance from harm for Joseph, Mary, and Jesus.  God is still at work today, acting for our good if we, like Joseph, prayerfully listen to our dreams, act on them, and go with the flow of God’s love in communion with the Church, God’s word, and Sacraments.  “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, just as he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world.”  We might find ourselves in an “Egypt experience” as Joseph did, at first glance awful, until we realize God is with us in that place, there’s a shortage of skilled wood-workers, and we can obtain food and every basic need by his skill as a carpenter. 	The Good News is God is with us.  And God will bring us back.  Jeremiah saw his nation conquered and his people marched into exile in Babylon.  But in faith, Jeremiah knew this was not the end.  There would be a return.  “For thus says the Lord:  Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob, and raise shouts for the chief of the nations; proclaim, give praise, and say, ‘Save, O Lord, your people, the remnant of Israel.’  See, I am going to bring them from the land of the north, and gather them from the farthest parts of the earth, among them the blind and the lame, those with child and those in labor, together; a great company, they shall return here . . . I will turn their mourning into joy, I will comfort them, and give them gladness for sorrow, I will give the priests their fill of fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my bounty, says the Lord.” 	So God brought  Israel back.  He brought the Christ child and his parents back.  Has he ever brought you back?  Once, twice, many times?  Amen?  Just as Jesus’ life was spared so that the way was cleared for his ministry, so to we are spared, brought back, given every spiritual blessing, so the way can be cleared for our ministry as baptized members of his body.  We are spared, brought back, healed, forgiven, for a purpose.  To witness that God is with us and can do great things through us if we are awake and attentive.  Today’s Gospel teaches us to listen to God’s voice in all circumstances, even in dreams and intuition, as God uses all these means to prepare us for service. 	The other day, Annie, my daughter, turned to me and asked:  Dad, have you made a resolution for the New Year?  I confessed that I hadn’t made one.  But maybe this could be a resolution for me and for you:  that we really try to listen to God this year, realize God is with us, and is leading us back, not to live for ourselves alone, but for ministry in his church.  Let’s back up this resolution appropriating Paul’s prayer for the Ephesians, a community of the church not much different than we are.  “I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him, so that, with the eyes of your heart enlightened, you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe.”  So, four gifts for the New Year:  wisdom and revelation, hope, riches of a glorious inheritance, and power.  Believe and it happens!

      Dear Friends: We have arrived at the threshold of Easter. Alleluia! Lent and Holy Week have flown by. It's been great to see some new faces among us. I've been wondering if the Passion of the Christ movie has had some effect on our attendance- probably some.   During Lent and Holy Week the themes I've thinking, praying, and sharing about have centered around two basic hopes: that we can free ourselves with the Spirit's help from the limits we put on our love of God and our neighbor, and, in doing this take on more and more the mind of Christ as the way we view the world and all the people we meet. The time in which we live is demanding this of us and even dragging us, kicking and screaming into a new way of living.   The biggest shift in mentality to enable all this is the Crucified mind. The Crucified mind is one with God and neighbor, seeks the good of the other, is willing to repent of personal faults, while overlooking the faults of others, and go the extra mile. The Crucified mind is able to let go of all those judgements of others which separate us from God and all of our brothers and sisters. We can meet each person and situation (even brought close in the media) trying to see it through the eyes of Christ: conquering the evil and pain in the world by a willingness to take some of it in to be destroyed by love- Christ's love in us!   But another mind is vying for our attention and among religious people and clearly has the upper hand in our day: the Crusading mind. The Crusading mindset permeates our thoughts with conviction about everything that is wrong in our world and other people- especially those who differ from us. From a position of self-righteousness we clearly see who is in the wrong, who our enemies are, and we take on the goal of annihilating them. We become very careful about who we share the love of Christ with because many are unworthy of His love. Our judgements make us more and more isolated, enjoying gathering only with like-minded "Crusaders" like ourselves.   St. Paul, who was the greatest example of a person who changed by God's grace from a Crusading mindset to a Crucified Mind, writes in Philippians 2:4ff: Let each of you look not to your own interests, but to the interests of others. Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus, who,k though he was in the form of God, did not regard egaulity with God as something to be exploited, but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness, and being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death--even death on a cross. Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
