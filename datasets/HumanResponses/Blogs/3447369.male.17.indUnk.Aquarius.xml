      i'm so tired. yesterday left me feeling dead. he (david) broke up with me yesterday. i thought i would be ok, because this relationship didn't mean that much to me. however, it obviously did.

      i wish that i could go back, if you know what i mean, to when everything was just straioght foward. life in general. i don't know how i'm keeping myself under control, even though somtimes i wish i could just let everything go. it would help, i think. just to live in peace, only a day. my mind is full of things that pass my imagination. all of these things that i have let happen. all i can think about is how wrong it is. i can't think of a way to fix anything. it's driving me crazy living in silence. that's why i emailed him today. but he's nto going to email me back. i know. he's just going to ignore everything.  i don't understand why everything feels so wrong or why i just don't want to be anywhere anymore. i want forget myself let alone forget all the bad things i let happen.  i wish i could make someone understand me. yes, i do talk about things but there's other things that are untold and i wish to keep them like that but it's them that are my main problem. it's my fault, i know that. i just can't help thinking that there is no way out of this stupid web of confusion i let myself get caught in. someone just save me from myself.

      okay it's getting worse but that does not stop me from trying to make it better we are uncommonly wrong as i let the thoughts flow right through me... shivering inside as though the cold has caught me my eyes are so sore - i can hardly see you swore that you would be there you promised me that you did care but you let me slip right through your fingers think about it, what you did your lies amount to nothing, awell as everything else you said.

       one and two,  i'm nearly out of the door three or four then i'm lieing on the floor i'd askyou a question because i'm wondering why i am so cold.  you came to me with malicious intent you roled into my head and messed me up instead i forgot to tell you that i hated you i'm at a loss but at least i know what was true...  and i'm sad, i know but it's not about you   i took so long to firgure myself out it's hard to know how feel when you're knocked out unconcious and cold you're lie are now old you intended to make me die

      one of the set of poems was brand new. their lyrics are clever, they're the words i wish i could use. oh well.  i'm school and i think i've od'd on cough medicine. this is my method of escape. i haven't taken cough medicine like this for ages. i didn't need it. i just wanted to make myself relaise what feeling weak really is like. i've done this times and times before. i don't mean to harm myself, it's to keep myself under control. though you're probably thinking that i'm not after what i did.  who cares? not me. neither do you. so i'm just going to leave this for now. maybe i'll have more to say later. maybe it will be less depressing.

       i never thought it would be this hard to start right from the beginning it's the first time i've actually looked at my progress of becoming out of control...  this is what you deserve when your life is on the line it's not from ignoring your mind it's from ignoring the signs  you take from me because i give you push me over my own edge you sucked the life out of me  stick to me like cellotape don't let me go until i'm all taken i'll drink the ink that creates this scrawl - i'll keep the image in my head the sweat, stale sense of what i need to forget.

       And we learn As we age We've learned nothing And my body still aches And we take Cause they give Though I love you And my body it leaks like a sieve     i am heaven sent,  dont you dare forget. i am all you've ever wanted, what all the other boys all promised. sorry i told. i just needed you to know. i think in decimals and dollars. i am the cause to all your problems, shelter from cold. we are never alone. coordinate brain and mouth. then ask me whats it like to have  myself so figured out. i wish i knew..  i hope this song starts a craze. the kind of song that ignites the airwaves. the kind of song that makes people glad  to be where they are, with whoever they're there with. this is war. every line is about, who i don't wanna write about anymore. hope you come down with something they can't diagnose, don't have the cure for. holding on to your grudge. oh its so hard to have someone to love. and keeping quiet is hard. cuz you cant keep a secret  if it never was a secret to start. at least pretend you didn't wanna get caught..  we're concentrating on falling apart. we were contenders, we're throwing the fight i was just wanna believe, i just wanna believe, i just wanna believe, in us.  Oh, we're so c-c-c-c-c-controversial. we are entirely smooth. we admit to the truth, we are the best at what we do. and these are the words you wish you wrote down. this is the way you wish your voice sounds, hansome and smart. oh my tongue's the only muscle on my body that works harder than my heart. and its all from watching tv, and from speeding up my breathing. wouldnt stop if i could. oh it hurts to be this good. you're holding on to your grudge. oh it hurts to always have to be honest with the one that you love. oh, so let it go..  we're concentrating on falling apart. we were contenders, we're throwing the fight i was just wanna believe, i just wanna believe, i just wanna believe. we're concentrating on falling apart. we were contenders, we're throwing the fight i was just wanna believe, i just wanna believe, i just wanna believe, in us.  this is the grace that only we can bestow. this is the price you pay for loss of control. this is the break in the bend, this is the closest of calls. this is the reason your alone, this is the rise and the fall.

      From the time I started to believe that everything would be ok, I started to hurt more You left me outside of my hopes but inside of reality There’s no escape from everyone else’s eyes You can always forgive yourself for what you have done  You lead me astray, I lost my clarity I let you lead me through the rain and to false shelter You spun me around in the disaster; you intended to ruin my dignity Could I set the record straight and ask you to give me the answers  If only I had a notion to notice your intention I could have questioned why I thought you cared Why I thought you loved me you could have given me hope to rise again.    this is the first and last time i'm going to do this to you. i never thought i could ever feel like this again - i thought everything would be ok. you promised me. oh and one at loss. i bleed. tchau to you.  why can't you appreciate that you're the one you sucked up to me until i made the decision? you lead me to the point where people think they would rather die. it was when you didn't react to my decision that got to me. you acted as though i meant nothing to you. and oblivious to you - you're the one that should be feeling like shit. yesterday you said i deserved to be smacked, well, it beats me why i derserve it. you deserve everything you get!  ''whatever poisions in this bottle will leave me broken sore and stiff -'' yeah. that's brand new.  everytime you said that i meant everything to you, that you couldn't do without me, that you would try anything to be with me, i made myself believe because i wanted to know and be happy. i've been hurting ever since that day we got back from paris. you asshole. you made me feel like killing myself. you had no sense of what i was feeling. you left me in the cold. and it got colder when you left. actually, when i left.  i'm going to write more later.  i bleed.
