      Today I found out about a heartbreak, an earnest wish, and a death in the family of a dear friend...through a blog.   So it has come to this. Isolation breeds alienation; solitude leads to loneliness.    Mea culpa.

      I used to have a website. I sort of miss it. If  only for the fact that I met some of the most interesting people in my world through that site. But then I thought I'm way too old or too busy for the website, or for those interesting people, or maybe both for both.   I think I simply ran out of words to keep up that site. And maybe I ran out on spirit to keep those people. My words lost its spirit; my spirit ran out of words.   So I kept to myself until I've figured out who "myself" really is. I'm only beginning to get there and each discovery is a revelation, a pleasant surprise, an unraveling.   The unlearning of who I thought I was has only just begun. I guess I'm still trying to get comfortable in this skin sans the pretensions, embellishment and the compulsive urge to please others. Took me ages to get here and maybe it's too late, but hey, it's cool!  So I leave by the wayside the things and places and people that have weighted me down to make room for the things and places and people that truly matter.

      There's a song that goes, "Early in the morning I cook breakfast for your table and make sure that your coffee has its sugar and cream. Your eggs are over easy...yadda, yadda."   My friends and I used to joke that this is the ideal song for when you're trimming your toenails or plucking out the hairs from your armpits. Personally, I believe this song was written while the composer was doing the number two in the loo. I picture the singer recording this bit while waxing her legs.  But hey, the song's a certified pop hit! It got so famous that one ex-Miss Saigon's singing career almost took flight with the Tagalog version ("Hindi ako si Darna...").  My point? Some people put too much energy into things that, when put in their proper perspective, are...well... silly. I'm one of those people sometimes. So as I was saying, "I'm not your superwoman..."

      Secondborn, middle child, weaned in violence, sired by a father who mistook fear for respect. You grew up half-believing you  are  worthless and would never amount to anything---like he used to say in those fits of fury.   He lashed at you with his belt or a solid piece of wood or anything he could get his hands on, but his most terrible weapon was his words. The pain subsides, the marks fade, but the words...how can you forget those terrible words??    And your mother...saintly, martyred, ever the pacifist...she wh taught you how to cry in secret, suffer in silence, and just "be good so Tatay  won't get angry anymore." Does she know how you despise her for not standing up to him, tolerating his abuse, letting herself be treated like a minion...and then exalting it all to "divine sacrifice"?   Fear has immobilized you. Fear of committing a mistake, of criticism, of ridicule, of imperfection, of either the propensity for rage or the idiocy of silent suffering...Why try, why do anything when your own father has already marked you as worthless, inutile...the very embodiment of himself?!  The secondborn, middle child...You with the broken spirit and defeated eyes...I despise you!  I am his firstborn.  I got the worst of it. And by God, I broke free; I survived; I thrived!  Look closely at yourself: You have become almost like him.

      A couple of months back I hit yet another all-time low. I felt so uprooted, unhinged, lost. I've never been religious but I'd like to think I've always been in touch with my spirituality. And so looking to recharge my spirit I took a detour to Tagaytay. Somehow I ended up at the Pink sisters convent.   It's amazing how purposeful the life of the Pink Sisters are. Their life's work is so concise, so concrete: to pray for us and lift up our petitions to God.   Wouldn't it be incredibe to wake up each day knowing that you'll be doing  exactly  the tasks for which you were put in this world?

      The vice president for sales and marketing of some company I applied for five months ago contacted me yesterday. The job description was a no-brainer for me because I've been doing  all that  for years. The position was junior management, the remuneration package was above average, the corporate structure itself was stable albeit modest-sized.   At the last minute I decided to turn down the offer, take a huge paycut, and take on an entirely different job. I decided to just be a cog in this huge transnational enterprise that I now work for. I needed a break from the things I have always thought defined me, my life. I needed to stop doing things I'm  expected to do ---and that includes not writing for a living.  So am I happy? Well, I suppose the lack of work-related stress is something to be thankful for. More than anything, I am eternally grateful to God that I am no longer (and will I ever be) connected with the company I used to work for.   So...am I happy? My good friend M said (1) If I  were  happy I wouldn't even give that offer (of yes, we were talking about  that , I almost forgot) a second thought, and (2) I may already be happy but am just too proud to admit it (probably because of the "image" my current job has been typecasted in) or just need affirmation that I am, in fact, happy.  So  am  I happy? With that fact that I can define my happiness regardless of what I do for a living, I'm ecstatic!

      It's funny how things catch up with you sooner or later. About 10 years ago I left home to find myself. The burden of being my family's "only hope" was too much. I couldn't see past being firstborn, (then) only daughter, big sister.   I know now that going away was the best thing for me. But it wasn't all good for those I left behind. Today I'm faced with the certainty that I am, in fact, the only one who  can  make things right in my family.  Lately my life's been pretty easy. I'm almost done fulfilling obligations carried over from a past relationship. My job doesn't involve anything more stressful than getting a crammed inbox. I've a partner and best friend who taught me to embrace life and laugh at myself a little more. I get to watch my dearest friend work her way towards fulfilling her life's dreams. I don't remember ever being this content.  I know I'm not yet "there"; I haven't "made it" yet; this isn't "it" for me. But for whatever reason, the cosmos has now decided to free my life up for something. It's as if there's something I  need  to fix first before I can go on with my life's journey. It's as if I can only move on by accomplishing this one task.  Thing is I've always known, haven't I?  I guess I need to come home---if not literally then figuratively. Maybe this is part of the purpose I've been asking God to show me.   I just hope I'm strong enough for this; that my childhood fears won't come back to haunt me; that I don't falter and doubt my own capability; that showing my brothers how to take on their demons won't be my own undoing.   This is like walking into a killer typhoon so I can lead my famiy out of it.   Faith. Steadfast.

      A friend of mine "cooled off" with his boyfriend, who seems to be getting his priorities all mixed up. The boyfriend admitted he probably needed time off to get his affairs in order.   Another friend broke up with her partner of 10 years. Now that really hit me hard. I guess they just both grew up and grew apart. All I know is that being on an emotional rollercoaster for years eventually takes its toll.   Unbelievably, yet another relationship (again of two dear friends) is on the rocks. Another long-time, through-the-fire partnership on the verge of a meltdown because one of them has fallen in love with someone else. Then again they have probably stopped being in love with each other way before this...   Now I am not about to preach on the virtues of working it out just because a couple has been together for a long time. Only my friends and their respective partners truly know the real score between them. And I respect that. It's the most I can do. But still I can't help but feel sad.   This morning out of sheer boredom I engaged my workmate in chitchat. Predictably the conversation eventually led to my marital status, or the lack thereof (for the life of me I can't understand why a decent conversation between women can't run it's course without one party asking if the other is married!).   Me being me, I said I'm gay (Mental note: Not everyone in this office has either or both common sense and/or common decency. In my short stay here I have been subjected a few times to ignorant-but-nonetheless-offensive homosexual jokes/remarks). I was waiting for the usual "you-don't-look-the-least-gay" remarks or the "it's-alright-to-be-gay-don't-be-ashamed-of-it" presumptions but lo and behold!..  The single mother I was talking to admitted that she herself is in a lesbian relationship for quite some time now. She said she had this MU (read: mutual understanding) with a self-proclaimed dyke in the all-girls high school she attended. It was a classic case of girl meets girl, falls in love with girl, and then forcefully separated from her by the girl's parents.   Twenty-two years has passed since then, things changed, she got married, had kids, and spent the last 6 years of her life saving that marriage...to no avail. A year ago she scoped out a potential new account for a former employer. Long story short, her old high school MU worked for that company!   My new friend has just celebrated her first anniversary with her best friend and partner. After 22 years... sila rin pala! ! Now that's hope.

      I flunked two consecutive quality assurance evaluations last night. My one transaction after 10 years of waiting wanted just  half the product . Was that woman kidding?!? I was so jittery going home last night, having heard that two girls got held up outside of the office building. Walking down my street, two drunks were having a shoutfest, I was trying not to run for fear of catching their attention.   I had my first major disagreement with my closest friend and dragged another dear friend into the melee. Well melee via mobile phone, that is. Could it be the beer I downed in five gulps? Hey, I was looking for the Cherry Coke I put in the fridge that morning and saw the leftover beer from last weekend's solo drinking spree so...  And as if it's not enough that I'm going through the worst ever part of my relationship and that the future is as clear as the Pasig River after a typhoon...Today I woke up at 5am with the all-too-familiar pain in my back. That's after finally falling asleep at half past two in the morning. Almost two hours of tossing and turning finally got me sleep-time extension---too much of an extension. I was late for work.   As a morose  coup de gras , I came into the office with a terrible migraine. I had to email my co-workers and supervisor to ask around for the one pain killer that doesn't kill me. Well, thank God for people like my supervisor who not only sent for the meds but also told me that she can cut me some slack if I ever needed to throw up (as migraine attacks go, you gotta puke to get better) or if I'm already seeing multicolored stars. I might just take her up on that offer, God bless her soul!  Finally, while everybody else is reeling from the effects of the cosmos rearranging their entire lives, this one person has pulled all stops on the theatrics and went all out on the paranoia. Who went where or did what with whom without telling who? When? Conspiracy theory ito.   And that's when it hit me...  There is a life lesson for me here. There is a blessing in all this. There is wisdom to be had! I am not petty after all!  I'm alright, I'm okay,  urlLink I think God can explain .

      You win some, you lose some.   I won the name-your-team and think-up-a-team-motto contest and actually got a prize for it. And the quality assurance people thought two of my transactions are good enough for an 87 and a 96, respectively (passing grade is 100). My other call, though converted, didn't quite make it but 81 is better than 10.   That's how evaluations go: You win some, you lose some.  My team (the team I thought up the name and motto for) had near-perfect attendance this week so we're supposed to get $150 for that. Well, nearly all the teams will get the pot money, and the amount will be divided among 10 or so people but hey, a win is a win and the extra money wouldn't hurt.  My site looks a lot better, a little more upbeat, happier. It's like getting a haircut or a facial when you're depressed. Whatever. I had help from my cool techie friend T, who's probably reading this now out of sheer boredom.  I've finished  urlLink Dan Brown's   Angels and Demons  and it did not disappoint me. Can't wait to get my hands on his two other novels. I hope they're worth it. Meanwhile, Vicki's fallen asleep over the first few chapters of   The Da Vinci Code . Funny.  I've finally gotten myself to "talk" and acknowledge the hurt of the past few days. My head is a lot clearer now. There was plenty to laugh about at the office and boy, did I take advantage of 'em all! It's all good. It's gonna get better.

       Communcation is the key to a good relationship. Communication is not just talking, but mostly listening. Listening not only means taking note of what is said but more importantly, hearing what is not spoken.  Friendship is knowing when and when not to be there. But no matter how much your friends love you they will, at one point or another, abandon you because it could be the kindest thing they could do for you, or themselves, at the moment.  Love is not just the starry nights and petal-strewn, red-carpet walk towards the sunset. Love after the roses can be boring, ugly, sad, painful, callous, selfish, difficult. Steering it back to the starry nights is the challenge.  Alone is being awake half past midnight downing your second bottle beer just so you'll fall asleep and forget that everyone else is on holiday with their families or partners while you're clutching your cell phone hoping to God someone,  anyone  will send a message,  any  message.  Fear is waking up to an excruciating pain in your back---the worst ever scoliosis episode you've ever had. You try to get up to reach your cell phone but you can't get up, not even to knock the intercom off its cradle. And then realizing your closest friend is at least 4 hours away, your partner is halfway across the world, and your family hasn't tried to contact you in almost a month.  Regret is knowing that everything will never be the same again after you've gone through the worst part of being alone and being afraid---not you, not love, not friendship.

      Yesterday a coworker was raving about QAF. He went on to initiate another coworker into the complex characters of Brian, Justin and Michael and the liberating life experience that is Babylon.    urlLink  Queer As Folk  ...I remember the very first time I saw that show. Lil’ ole me mingling with the "in" crowd at "the" bar, with QAF's pilot episode playing on the overhead monitor. Nobody could hear anything above the music but hell if we don't know what they were  doing ! That night I met people who eventually became my Brians and Michaels and Justins, Mels and Lindsays in that place that eventually became my very own private Babylon.  It's been two years. Our Babylon has long been shut down. I haven't seen many of the characters in my QAF. And well, life has toned down, maybe even died down a little bit. But sometimes a particular moment, a song, a familiar laughter…or a coworker raving about the show he’s seen…takes me back to that time. And I miss it, I miss them, I miss us, I miss the me I was then.

      I got so sick at the office ( with the office  would sound right, too) that I had to go home early. Next day I called in sick. And then the deadbolt to my unit broke! My landlady didn’t seem to understand the urgency of replacing the lock in the near future.   That was the straw that broke the camel’s back. I finally broke down sobbing, bemoaning the latest misfortune in a seemingly accursed and doomed week. And then I remember shouting “Enough!”, wiping the snot from my face and taking matters into my own hands---fever, backache and all.   Marching up to the hardware, I shopped for a sturdy but inexpensive deadbolt and got at least 150 pesos off the tag price. I think I did a great job of replacing the broken deadbolt using the tool set I got for Christmas. Hah!  Next day my friends drove hundreds of miles to visit, arrived at midnight and even baked a cake for me. No one has ever baked anything for me in my entire life! My partner sent a dozen red roses and an adorable stuffed bear from halfway across the world. My soul sistahs P and D from work called to check if I was alright. Coworkers G, I, and T, my techie friend also sent in how-you-doing text messages. And when I got back to work, I read an email from C, who was pissed-off big time with Toxic Supervisor Wannabe not just because of what TSW did to her but also to me.   I finally got that much-needed massage at this new spa I discovered just a few streets away from my house. Later that day I got me another slice of that heavenly cake and lounged in my new chair to watch the new movies I rented. As I was falling asleep I remember smiling at the sweet smell of the roses by the window…

      I was 10 and for all intents and purposes as asexual as any other 10-year-old girl can be. I remember sitting across a young woman in a public jeepney and being utterly transfixed, spellbound even. She wasn't the most beautiful face I've ever seen but she  was  pretty and slim, slightly athletic in built.   What fascinated me was how feminine she appeared--from her clothes to her makeup to her voice--and yet there was something distinctly un-feminine in the way she moved. She sat hunched over, elbows propped on knees, hands clasped between her legs. The way she looked straight at the men who ogled her, the way she flipped her hair off of her face, the way she moved her hands...I can't quite put my finger on it but I was riveted! There's something about her that can neither be identified nor classified readily, something both masculine and feminine, something so very  un-ordinary .  That old memory was brought back by the new "epic"  urlLink TV commercial by Pepsi , better known as  We Will Rock You! . The advertisement stars Enrique as the emperor anticipating the to-the-death battle of gladiators Beyonce, Britney and Pink, as a Colosseum-ful of spectators roars for blood.  Booty-shaking Beyonce was riveting, yes. And if I were into bombshell-but-dumb blondes, Britney's a sight to behold. But it was Pink who I can't tear my eyes away from. The boy-woman with her raspy voice and angry eyes and raw sensuality...    Androgyny is confounding.

      Yesterday A and I had coffee with an old friend (and ex-partner). We had a nice chat and everyone was comfortable, as should be among friends. She looks happy with the way things are in her life now that she and her partner have moved into a home of their own.   A few hours after, I got text messages…Apparently, my friend wasn't answering her phone so her partner went "looking" for her. I couldn't help but silently disapprove. To a casual observer the partner looked like she was checking up on my friend, who was meeting up with her ex (me). Tsk. Notwithstanding, I wish my friend light and love in her new life. She deserves nothing less.   A and I pigged out, to say the least. I think I've gained in two days all the weight I've lost in three weeks! I'm so glad I didn't watch the  Hellboy  VCD I rented last week. Some movies are just meant for the big screen.   The weekend would have been perfect if we made it to P's. I should've known that someone who would actually bake a cake for a friend will naturally go to lengths to make them feel welcome in her home. I can understand why even M was disappointed, to say the least. Well...things happen for a reason and I believe we weren't meant to be there that night.   Friday I went on my monthly pilgrimage of sorts to the Pink Sisters Convent in Tagaytay. Feels good to be able to fulfill at least this one promise in my life. Amazing how many things came to mind when I was lifting up my gratitude to God---in spite of my daily complaints and sundry misfortunes, real or imagined.  Much as I missed the hung-over, rocking party weekend I used to have a few years back, I had fun this weekend. A cozy, comfy, tug-at-your-heart kind of fun. And, well to be very honest, I’m not really saying I  didn’t  have a wild weekend…   ..oo00oo..   I am suffused with a sense of enlightenment I haven't felt in a long time.  Thursday I learned that the father of an old friend died late last month. Dad. I got the news, in passing, through an email from another friend I felt so hollow. I remember being 19 while on vacation in that friend’s childhood home. I remember watching intently while her dad (who was a human rights lawyer and later, judge) counsels his mostly  pro bono  clients.   I vowed one day to become a formidable investigative journalist for the then principled  Philippine Daily Inquirer . Someday I hope to be worthy enough to write a full-length feature on the man. With my disillusionment at PDI and Philippine media in general came the realization that I’m never going to be able to write that story. Ever.   This friend and I, we go a long way back. Sixteen years, a marriage, one daughter and five life partners back, to be exact. With my disillusionment at my old friend and friendship in general came the understanding that she and I have grown up and grown apart. Ultimately.   But something tells this friendship isn’t quite over just yet. She’s pregnant…and she said I’m going to be godmother to her son. The cosmos isn’t finished with us yet.

      A series of seemingly unrelated events took place after this word appeared in my horoscope one day.    Perspicacity  n 1: intelligence manifested by being astute (as in business dealings) [syn: shrewdness, astuteness, perspicaciousness] 2: the capacity to assess situations or circumstances shrewdly and to draw sound conclusions [syn: judgment, judgment, sound judgment, sound judgment]  I've always been secure with the knowledge that I  know   people, I am  very  perceptive, I  can  feel unspoken thoughts. I thought to myself, "Hey, this is  my  word. This  is  me!"  The cosmos put me in my place.  Just recovering from a nasty flu, I was told my grandfather died. But it was a peaceful death--no pain, no struggle, no anguish. He even asked for cake and  pansit  on his last birthday. He lived a full life at 94, never going senile. A few days before he crossed over, he was asking for my grandmother to join him at dinner...She died years ago. We knew then.  Trials come in bundles, I think.  I came back to work after a long absence that ultimately earned me a written warning from my supervisor. I knew I had it coming, but it was nonetheless disappointing.   And then I get another call: J was in trouble. Much trouble. The kind of trouble that required the family lots of courage, patience, understanding  and  money to get him out of.  They  didn't know yet; it was my responsibility to break the news to them.  It was probably the most painful phone call I've ever made. Decades of dammed-up anger broke, hurtful words were exchanged, damning curses vowed. For the first time in my entire life, I raised my voice at  him .   He  is to blame for  all this.  If he had been a better person, J would have known how to live his life better.    "Putangina ko?! Putangina mo rin!"  My rage consumed me that night. And yet strangely, it also set me free.  I am still struggling, worrying still keeps me up at night, A has to remind me to stop thinking too much. ButI refuse to believe what  they  believe. I know that J is silently screaming for help and it kills me that I have no resources to singlehandedly give him that.   I am coping. I  will  fix this. I have faith.   ..oo00oo..   On a happy note, I would like to thank my techie friend T, who is responsible for this new blog layout. It's beautiful! Not as hip and edgy as  urlLink BreakDownAndCry  but much loved, nonetheless. I thank him for unknowingly keeping my spirits up that very difficult week.

      Last week my techie friend T left the office for good. The week before, Moonflower also resigned. They are now with companies that have better benefits, in positions that better suit their qualifications. I'm sad that two of the sunniest people I've met here have left. But I'm happy that they have begun to embrace their entitlement to success. My only hope is that they never forget the friends they left behind.  Speaking of friendship, another one bites the dust. Another long-term relationship left like roadkill in the highway of scorned affection. Reminds me of the song "Love Is A Battlefield". Ten years ago I was part of this group where everyone was in love with everyone else. The friendship lasted the entire summer. Everyone walked away losing more than a partner but also a best friend.  Deja vu .   It's painful to watch my friends commit the same mistakes I have, and not be able to do anything about it. I have no right. All I can do is wait for when they would need a shoulder to cry on...and pray they prove me wrong.  ...When adults disillusion me I look to children for solace. And they never fail me. I saw an Oprah rerun on the some of the world's most talented kids...  Six years ago, Akiane Kramarik was introduced to pastels. To date, she has received world acclaim for her artwork and completed 40 paintings--some of which have sold for as much as $25,000! Akiane is nine years old. When Oprah asked where Akiane thinks her talent comes from, the girl simply said, "from God."    Esteban Cortezar's fascination with fashion began when he was still a young child in Bogota, Colombia. Esteban was 10 when his family moved to Miami, where he befriended models and met his mentor, Gianni Versace. Now a high school senior, Esteban was the youngest designer ever to present his collection on the runways at New York's Fashion Week.   Three years ago Ryan Hreljac learned that people were dying in Africa from poor drinking water, so he set out to raise $70 to donate towards building a clean-water well for a village in Uganda. Ryan's campaign has now raised more than $210,000 and built 50 clean-water wells in developing countries. Ryan is nine years old.  The world is a better place with kids like these.

      Soon as we come out of the womb, they sever the umbilical cord to disconnect us from our mothers. They never succeed.  I just realized that no matter how okay you think you are you will still feel better when you've talked to your mom. Well, provided it was a good talk and you didn't have an argument with her, for once. Even if she tells you that she's too busy to send you a letter [She's a 60-year-old government employee who will be retiring this December, how busy can she get?] or she can't send you text messages because her mobile phone's broken [I thought it was the kids who were supposed to say this to their moms?].  All thanks to a quick phone call courtesy of my brother, who wanted  me  to make a follow up with our mother about something  he  needs. I learned that my other brother is doing very well. He is now with his wife and kids, tending to a very modest but pretty successful food delivery business. I still feel a pang of regret knowing I wasn’t much help to him financially, which is where he needed help the most.  My sister is starting school next week. Her last year in high school! My mother said she would like it if M takes up B.S. Nursing because there’s a huge demand for nurses overseas. In my younger days I would’ve objected to that logic. But today I told her of my plans to work abroad in the very near future. Only then did I realize how serious I am about it. Where’d the patriotism, the activism, the anti-imperialism of my college days gone to? [insert snicker here]   My mother also mentioned the application for immigration to New Zealand she has been pushing on me for years now. Had to tell her finally that I lost the papers a few weeks after she sent them to me. I guess this is the only response she can think of when I told her my woes about working here. I bet she still can’t figure out why I took a 40% pay-cut to take an entry-level job straight out of the junior-managerial position I left last year. I know it’s not easy to accept that my reason in taking this job is because  I am tired of writing for a living.   Which brings me to the topic of my job…Let’s just say that today I tried to make this office a better place to work in. I aired my sentiments to one of the individuals that evaluates our performance. I even had a co-worker proofread it to check if I was too harsh or un-diplomatic. Long story short, I think I made a mistake. I think when they said this company had an open-door policy they only meant that very few offices here have doors, and those doors are hardly ever closed.   No matter how good I try, I always seem to come up short according to the myriad performance matrices, evaluation standards and quality assurance criteria. Doesn’t matter if I don’t use up any of my breaks----if the system fucks up and says that I went on over-break for 300 hours, the system is  still  right. I can only be grateful that I have a considerate and intelligent supervisor. Then again, the supervisor can only do so much  because the system is still going to be right.  Yeah right. Let me take a few moments to think if it’s worth my energy to effect change within the system. If not, then I guess it’s time to leave the system. Deadline: July 31, 2004.  Meantime, I’m going back to my writing. I guess there’s no disconnecting me from my craft, too.

      Techie friend T and Moonflower have left and gone corporate, it would be a long time until I see them again. My work schedule has changed, which means no more heart-to-heart talks, belly laughs and goodbye hugs with Dee and Pao. Since I am now with the "morning girls" I'd better get used to the almost-nonstop chitchat and the cackling that sometimes grate on my nerves.  It's been months since I lost touch with a kindred spirit. Well,  she  decided to lose me.  Recently I found out that she and some other individuals thought I was having an affair with another friend——a case of mistaken identity that gives me the giggles until now. This kindred spirit has always been protective of my partner and looked out for her like a baby sister. Go figure.   I finally mustered the energy to deal with a sensitive issue that I’m not even involved in. I feel that I am being looked upon for affirmation that I cannot give. I hope that  that  is the last I hear of it no matter if it means the end of friendship where I found my closest friend and my life partner. I am too old for this.  And now as I look back at what’s happening in my life lately I see that I’ve been doing a lot of hanging on to things and people that have moved on. Tsk. Sometimes I forget how good life is at the other side of the looking glass.

         by Mira Kirshenbaum     Energy drainer: Other People's Expectations  Are you living someone else's dream for you? You're putting out energy but starving emotionally. The other person gets all the satisfaction.     How to fix it:  Declare Independence  You bought in; you can set yourself free. No confrontation needed, just "I don't have to expect that of myself." Worst case scenario: Someone who's not you will be disappointed. You will feel wonderful.      Energy drainer: Loss of Self  As kids, we had to play by the rules; our unique energy got caged.     How to fix it:  Personalize Your Life  Ask yourself, If it were up to me, what would I...hang on my wall? Wear to work? Do for fun? Find the pockets of freedom where you can be more yourself.     Energy drainer: Deprivation  Duties and responsibilities fill your days. You gain weight trying to get emotional energy from food.     How to fix it:  Add Pleasure, Beauty, Fun  Satisfying experiences, large and small, are the real nourishment you crave. Plan a big treat to look forward to-and a little one every day.      Energy drainer: Envy  We often don't feel envy directly-but we might find someone else's good fortune depressing.     How to fix it:  Count Your Blessings  Comparison is a loser's game. Look at what you have, and actively feel grateful. (P.S. That person you envy-you don't know how messy her life really is. Chances are you wouldn't want it if you had it.)      Energy drainer: Worry  When you worry, you think you're dealing with things, but you're just suffering. Worry never comes up with good ideas. It torments and exhausts us.     How to fix it:  Get Going  Action is the cure for worry. Do one thing that brings you a step closer to coping. If it's the middle of the night, get up and write a to-do list.      Energy drainer: Unfinished Business  Unmade decisions and postponed projects drain you.     How to fix it:  Do It or Dump It  Forget the perfect decision-just trust yourself and make a choice. Put projects in an appointment book. If you can't find any good time, that's a signal you don't want to do it. So don't.      Energy drainer: Overcommitment  You're always saying "Yes"-to your boss, mother, kids, friends; to requests, favors, meetings.     How to fix it:  Say "Yes" to Yourself  Tell someone else "No" every once in a while, just to feel your own power. You'll gain a whole new sense of your abilityto take care of yourself.      Energy drainer: Holding On to Loss  Fresh loss is an emergency. But old losses you can't let go of are dead weight.     How to fix it:  Cry All Your Tears  Indulge in big-time mourning. Take off from work, stay in bed, and do nothing but cry till you're dry...and bored. Then go out and embrace life.

        Some people have a lot to say for themselves. But it doesn't necessarily follow that they know very much. Others have a tendency to keep quiet, but we can't assume this is because they have nothing to contribute. Where normally you might be inclined to make a big fuss about an unacceptable situation, you are currently feeling uncharacteristically reticent. This is neither timidity nor stupidity. It is intuitive wisdom at work. Somehow you know that circumstances will soon change. You ought to wait until they do before making your next move.

         by Judith Orloff, M.D. From the April 2002 issue of O, The Oprah Magazine   Some people bring unexpected lightness and comfort to your life. They crackle with energy, practically electrify you with their presence. And then there are those who leave you feeling stressed out. Or guilty. Or exhausted down to your very last molecule. I call them energy vampires, and obnoxious or meek, they come in all forms. The sob sister, for one, always considers herself the victim. The world is always against her, and she'll recount every horrible thing that has happened to her, wallowing in every perceived slight. The charmer is a constant talker or joke-teller who has to be the center of attention. The blamer, on the other hand, doles out endless servings of guilt. And then there's the drama queen, the co-worker who claims she almost died from a high fever or the neighbor who lives in extremes of emotion—life is unbelievably good or horrifically bad.   No matter which type of energy vampire you're dealing with, you're allowed to walk away. Many of us find this really hard to do. We're afraid of being thought of as impolite; we don't want to offend people. But there are plenty of ways to remove yourself from a killing conversation. When leaving isn't an option, you can still maintain your energy level by making a few minor adjustments.   Recognize the Signs  One of the first things to do is to recognize when you're being drained, and that begins with tuning in to your physical reactions. Is there a tightening in your chest when a certain person enters the conversation? Do you feel tired when you hang up the phone after speaking with someone? Does your head ache, or do you feel what I call "slimed" when another guest at a cocktail party starts talking to you?    Take a Deep Breath  The moment you feel zapped—or hemmed in, or stressed out—I recommend taking a breath. Breathing is a wonderful way to center yourself. Just follow the breath and tell yourself that you know what's happening and you can deal with it. It's important to remember our individual power. I know from working with patients that we can lose it easily. The minute somebody comes in who's bossy or blaming, we feel diminished and tense up. If we can focus on the breath, or on an image of a striking sunset or a view from a mountaintop, the tension will drift away.    Use Your Energy  You can also use some of your own subtle energy to counter the effects of an energy vampire. Visualize a protective white light around you: an energy shield. You can still hear the person who's yelling at you or blaming you or pushing herself into your sphere, but she won't cut into you so viscerally anymore. You've created a buffer zone, where her negative influences can dissipate.   Set Boundaries  Setting boundaries is another way of protecting yourself; you draw a line saying, for instance, "This is what I can do for you, and this is what I can't." You don't have to convince the vampire of the rightness of your stance. Getting defensive simply adds to the negative charge of the encounter. You want to remain neutral. When someone starts pushing your buttons, and you start sizzling inside, you've got to make the decision not to react.   Step Back  I also suggest you step back and think about what type of people aggravate you, because I believe that one law of energy is that we attract what we haven't yet worked out in ourselves. If I'm a very angry person, I'll find myself surrounded by angry people. By paying attention to the people who seem so draining, you might discover something you need to address. It has been my experience that once you've worked through a particular issue, you're no longer worn out by that kind of energy vampire. And the vampires, robbed of a source, move on to more easily drainable audiences.

        Are you friends with people that constantly drain your energy, in both obvious and subtle ways? Several types of people will exhaust you or deter you from your path of extreme self-care.  Cheryl Richardson , author of  Take Time for Your Life , gives you the types of friends to watch out for.    The Blamer   This is a person who consistently blames you and/or everyone else for her problems. The world and the people in it always seem to create havoc for this person, and instead of taking responsibility for her life, she'd rather blame others.    The Complainer   This person likes to hear her own voice. She constantly complains about what isn't working in her life and yet gets energy from complaining and dumping her frustrations on you.    The Drainer   This is the needy person who calls to ask for your guidance, support, information, advice, or whatever she needs to feel better in the moment. Because of her neediness, the conversation often revolves around her, and you can almost feel the life being sucked out of you during the conversation.    The Shamer   This person can be hazardous to your health. The shamer may cut you off, put you down, reprimand you, or make fun of your or your ideas in front of others. She often ignores your boundaries and may try to convince you that her criticism is for you own good. The shamer is the kind of person who make you question your own sanity before hers.    The Discounter   This is the person who discounts or challenges everything you say. Often, she has a strong need to be right and can find fault with any position. It can be exhausting to have a conversation with the discounter, so eventually you end up giving in and deciding to just listen.    The Gossip   This person avoids intimacy by talking about others behind their backs. The gossip gets energy from relaying stories, opinions, and the latest "scoop." By gossiping about others, she creates a lack of safety in her relationships, whether she realizes it or not. After all, if she'll talk about someone else, she'll talk about you.
