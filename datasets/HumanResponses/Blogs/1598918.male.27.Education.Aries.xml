       WHY KAZAA IS BAD NEWS FOR THOMASU   Here are a few reasons not to download/use file sharing software (such as  KAZAA ) on campus.  Not only is it illegal to share intellectual property such as a popular song or movie clip, but  urlLink the RIAA has begun to prosecute KAZAA users .  There is also a bill in congress  urlLink (`Piracy Deterrence and Education Act of 2003')  that, if passed, will bring the federal government into the hunt for copyright infringement.  So, downloading music that you have not paid for is illegal.  And software that allows such trading should not be on campus computers.

       BUENA VISTA UNIVERSITY IS DOING TECHNOLOGY RIGHT   While at a conference in Atlanta last week, Buck and I met Ed Barboni, a gentleman who works with small Universities and Colleges throughout the nation.  Buck asked, "What schools have you visited that are getting it right?  Who is seemlessly integrating technology onto their campus?"  Ed quickly spat out, "Buena Vista University.  Though they have a lot of money, they are doing everything absolutely right."    Check out the  urlLink Buena Vista University Site .

       urlLink THE STATUS OF UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING   This article requires  urlLink Adobe Acrobat Reader  which can be downloaded  urlLink here  if for some strange reason you are without.   Excerpt - "Today there are over one hundred laptop campuses. Most are in Canada and the United States. Within larger universities are another fifty-plus subgroups, especially colleges of business and engineering, that require commonly configured laptops of students and faculty in the programs. Beyond these universal laptop programs, we estimate that at least half of all colleges and universities in the United States are 'practicing ubiquity' -- that is, teaching proceeds on the assumption that every student and faculty member has appropriate access to the Internet. Ironically, the tight definition of ubiquitous computing no longer prevails because the concept itself has become ubiquitous."  The articles discusses the implications of a true tech savvy campus while relating the trials and tribulations of a few trailblazing college's and universities.  Leave a comment to let me know what you think.

       SPYWARE TUTORIAL    urlLink What is Spyware?   Spyware (aka adware) refers to programs that essentially spy on your computer habits.  This information (such as what websites you visit and how long you are there) is sold to another company or used to tailor advertisements to pop up on your computer.  Not only is Spyware unwanted, but the programs eat up computer resources and have been known to cause full system crashes.  The programs are written to run behind the scenes and to self propogate themselves.  They often come packaged with popular free programs like KaZaA and Comet Curser as their inclusion in the download package is buried in the "End User Liscence Agreement."  What can we do?  Well there are a few programs that help us in our fight against Spyware.   urlLink Ad-Aware is my favorite.    urlLink While Buck prefers SpyBot.   Once you download the software, make sure to update it before use.  Remember to call,  urlLink email me , or stop by with any questions.

A few other programs that should not be found on Thomas University computers are:   urlLink KaZaA   urlLink Hotbar  (or "Hotbar Toolbar")  Xupiter (or "Xjupiter")  Gator   (or "Precision Time/Date Manager")  Comet Cursor (or "The Comet Cursor Plus")    Some of these are prime examples of SpyWare.  I will post more on SpyWare and how to remove it in the near future.

       urlLink Colleges toughen rules on Net viruses   This article reports that colleges all over the country are having major problems with virus attacks.  Most of our virus troubles at Thomas University have been unnoticed by most of you though we had a couple of days of frantic activity.  Behind the scenes we (mostly Billy) have been working feverishly to stem the tide.  We are being flooded with attempts to infect computers on our network here.  What can you do?  Mostly, it has been done.  You should keep up with the critical Windows updates following the procedure we sent around to everyone last week.  As far as anti virus updates, those are done automatically by our central system for any computer connected to our network.  If you have any questions then, as you usually do, call us.

      You ain't seen nothin' yet:   urlLink News : "You may think that computers have taken over most aspects of your life. But you ain't seen nothing yet. It's predicted that in 20 years' time, 'there will be 100 times more computers, each 100 times more powerful than now. They will be everywhere - in toys, in books, in clothes, under our skin, in chairs, in pills. They will be connected by wireless at 100 times today's speed. Their programs, however, will still be hand-crafted, and subject to continuous change.' That's the view of Sir Tony Hoare, previously Professor of Computer Science at Oxford University and now a researcher at Microsoft's Research Lab in Cambridge. He wants fellow computer scientists to think about how to handle this scary new world."

       urlLink Wired News: Cheapskate's Guide to a Safe PC : "'Some people's computers are the virtual version of an insane asylum and a prison, home to all sorts of crazy, ill-intentioned and just plain bad characters.'  If you're wondering what lunacy your computer might contain but aren't in the mood to fork over a few hundred bucks for software that can examine and secure your system, fret not. There are plenty of free tools available for download that do a good basic job of purging and protecting computer systems. And some of these tools, such as SpamBayes, Spybot and the Mozilla Web browser, work better than similar commercial products."  Check out the article in Wired Magazine or online at the link above.  I know a lot of you have asked me what you can do about all the worms, viruses (viri, I guess) and spam.  This is a good guide to free stuff that works.

       urlLink The Chronicle: 3/5/2004: Recipe for an Affordable Supercomputer: Take 1,100 Apples ... ,  by: Hassan Aref, dean of the College of Engineering and professor of engineering science and mechanics at Virginia Tech.  You probably can't get to this link without a subscription to the Chronicle of Higher Education.  In print the article is from the issue dated March 5, 2004, Section: The Chronicle Review Volume 50, Issue 26, Page B14.  The article is worth reading.  It confronts us with important pilosophical as well as practical considerstions for our species in the future vis a vis computers.  Its probably plaguristic to chain quotes together with no ellipeses to show lack of context but I've done it anyway to share what I think are the most interesting points of the article.  No. 3 on the list (of the fastest computers in the world) is Virginia Tech X which is a cluster of 1,100 Apple G5 desktop computers.  It follows that any institution or company that can afford to set aside 1,000 desktop machines, and to invest in the communications software to link them, can own a supercomputer.  As we construct machines that rival the mental capability of humans, will our analytical skills atrophy? Will we come to rely too much on the ability to do brute-force simulations in a very short time, rather than subject problems to careful analysis? Will we run to the computer before thinking a problem through?  Humans have had centuries to come to grips with machines that outperform us in physical endeavors. A major challenge for the future of humanity is whether we can also learn to master machines that outperform us mentally. One day a supercomputer will mean a computer with superhuman intelligence.

       Where does all this stuff on my computer come from?   While only 6% of employees own up to downloading spyware, administrators estimate that 30% of the computers on their networks have been infected.  A Wired News article, urlLink   A Web of Electronic Denial  , comments on a survey conducted by Websense.  The results of the urlLink  Web@Work 2004 survey  make interesting reading.  Would you rather give up your morning coffee or your ability to use the Internet for personal reasons at work?  According to the survey 49% would rather give up their morning coffee.  But, back to the Wired article: What about all that stuff on your computer that you deny having ever put there.  My experience here at TU is acurately reflected in these quotes used in the Wired piece:  "Chances are, people with spyware on their machines have no idea what spyware is, had no idea what they were downloading, and maybe were even totally unaware they downloaded anything at all," said Vitelle.   "Spyware does come bundled in all sorts of 'free' applications. And some websites make it seem like you need to download a plug-in or program to access the site, so people who haven't much of a clue about computers and don't read the long licensing agreements that spell out exactly how the software is going to screw you and your computer truly don't realize that they downloaded spyware."

       Pendrives – Now available at TU Store!   Can you imagine fitting the data from 24 floppy disks onto a device no bigger than a pack of gum? Consider the pint-sized USB drives. Known by many names – jump drives, pen drives, flash drives, memory drives; they can plug directly into a USB port on your computer so that you can transfer data between systems, take work home from the office, or use as temporary storage. All USB drives are compatible with Macs and Windows 98/ME/2000/XP systems that have USB ports. They are “plug and play” for Macs and Windows ME/2000/XP systems; Windows 98 systems may have to install some drivers before the system can recognize the drive. These drives do not require any additional power source since they draw their power from the USB connection. Once the drive is plugged in, the system will automatically detect it as a removable drive. Using Explorer or Finder, you can copy or move files to the USB drive from the hard drive, or modify or delete any files currently on the USB drive. Some USB drives even have an LED that blinks as data is being copied to it.  USB drives are made by a number of manufacturers. Names like Sandisk, BUSlink, and LEXAR are some of the ones you can find on the market. A few of the drives also have advanced features like the ability to password-protect files, divide the drive into different security zones, or write-protect the drive from accidental file deletion. USB drives range in capacity from 16 megs to 2 gigs with prices between $15 to $350, depending on capacity, features, and manufacturer. Like other storage devices, these drives do have a limited life span – estimated MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) is 300,000 hours.

       urlLink  Digital Images Come of Age    "In recent years, large collections of digital images have become available for licensing, and institutions have created a growing body of digital images from their own collections. Subject specialist librarians from The University of California libraries as well as UC visual resource curators advocated for the California Digital Library to acquire several commercial collections of images, create a shared image database, and purchase presentation software for classroom use and formal visual analysis. The CDL has extensive experience in licensing and delivering textual materials such as electronic journals and abstracting and indexing databases, but digital images introduce a range of new issues for management and delivery. . . ."

       urlLink  USATODAY.com - Add science, business, mathematics and stir    Looks like somebody has thought up a new degree for the modern world to educate students who are strong in science and math to be managers who are comfortable with the business of science. Its " a new master's degree, the professional science master's (PSM) , which promises to be the hot degree no one seems to have heard of yet. It's so new that its first graduates were in 2002. Fewer than 400 students have earned a PSM. But the programs are expanding rapidly and are now offered at 45 universities in 20 states."

       urlLink  Proof that Dick Cheney is a Robot    According to the Weekly World News, an unnamed CIA source has revealed that Dick Cheney is a robot. Unfortunately, says the source, the designers were "unable to give it emotions and compassion". The robot can move and speak almost as well as a human and its electronic brain has 24/7 wireless Internet access. A leaked photo shows Cheney with a portion of his chest folded back, revealing wiring and circuit boards. While the source reported that Cheney-bot is unable to learn from experience, he also commented that "the darn thing is smart, I'll give it that much." Cheney's frequent hospital visits are actually a cover for maintenance on his circuits.   urlLink
