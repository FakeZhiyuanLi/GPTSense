       I overworked.    It's weird that I can not concentrate on my work 100%.    I will go rafting tommorow. I hope I will have fun to refresh myself.     &nbsp;   With broken heart, I wandered around.&nbsp;:(&nbsp;    How come will I get cured?    Whoever, help me!

      Today is Saturday! Yeah!!!!!!!! Actually today is off but I came to work. On my desk, the pile of manuscript to revise.  Let me talk about my work. At first, when I was a really really freshman (In fact, I am rather new to company. I have worked for this company since the beginning of 2004.), all about the publishing and making books are so new to me that I was very very excited! About one month ago, when the my first book came out, my heart beat hard. We planned the EFL program that consis of 23 books and work books, 46 audio tapes, and  23 teacher's guide books. It is so huge that we could not finish this project at a time. Now we brought out one third of them. We have a long way to go.

      As I consider, an attractive person should have his or her own taste, which means 'inclination'. Those who don't have any characteristics are boring. When I meet boring people, there is nothing to share because it is too hard to bring up a topic to talk about. It's a torture! However those who have too strong taste is difficult to get along with as well. The kinds of people are likely to be sttuborn. They need the more flexible attitude. On the contium between two ends, it is tricky to find a moderate point to settle myself. Where am I?

       urlLink    This is my desktop's background image. I love this painting. First I like the atmosphere of the forest. It is not too light as well as not too dark. It's beautifully dim lit. Second, look at the naked girl. Among the men wearing formal suites, the lady enjoys liberty 100%!  Posted by  urlLink Hello

      Oh...I am addicted to blogging. Actually I have had my own other blog for about 2 years. It is a blog for both me and my close Korean friends. There are about 500 pics and posts. I love it. However I can not talk as freely as I want because there are too many eyes to watch me.  I have not let the others know this blog yet. Any of my friends don't know about this blog. It's my secret place where I can make new friends. It would be a good chance to me, I think. Therefore I went surfing others' blogs. There were tons of blogs that can be connected to mine. However it was not easy to leave my comment to whom I totally don't know. (Am I too timid, huh?) Anyway... I spent about 2 hours just browsing here and there. I found that not many Koreans use this service and many kinds of peolple who have different interests and background are connected to this blogging service. Whatever, it was fun! I should live more meaningfully so as to post more meaningful stuffs on this blog. too serious to talk in this way? If you do, maybe... it is due to my silly Enlgish skill...^_~

      I took a one day holiday and went West Sea with my family.  West Sea has large muddy fields where my kinds of sea creatures live. There are little water, when we go there at low tide, so we can't go into the water. Instead swimming, we just walked along the sea shore and ate grilled clam. We had fun together.  Since the beginning of 2004, I had been too busy to be together with my family. Meanwhile I neglected my family a little because of job and school stuffs, so I am content with today's short trip.

      This weekend is almost gone. Tomorrow my new weekday will start.  I want to work harder and to spend more valuble weekdays. :)  I went rafting two days ago with my co-workers. We had great time. I was happy to hang out and work with them.  Today I went to my grandma's house and had lunch with her. She is so old that she is wierder than before, but I always try to understand her though it is not easy to do so. Getting old is scary. I want not to be older. (Am I a Perterpan? -_- Rather than Peterpan I wanna be a Tinkerbell because she is pretty and hot. haha)  While I talked with my co-workers in Kanwondo, I asked my self how much I knew about love. Well... actually I don't know well. I suspend whether the love I did before was true or not. Was it merely a play with hearts? I don't know... So many things I don't know about me!

      I like to devide peolple into two categories. ( Don't call my behavior "the term of black and white ". It is just my play. ) There are two kinds of people in the world. Those who call others first and those who receive other's call. One of my friend belong to the latter type. She is sweet and kind but she never calls others first. Whenever I call her, she would say "Why didn't you call me? I missed you so much that I was about to call you. " I know there are ill bad intension for her not to call first. It is just a habit. It might be the matter of one's personality about how he or she is active or passive. As my acquaintances are busier and busier, it also became harder to call them and to make a sudden appointment with them. Nevertheless I would rather be a caller than a receiver cuz I am not good  at waiting.

      In the morning breafast at home: small rice balls. a cup of cold green tea a pack of orange juice(its amount might be similar a cup's capacity. ) a pill of mutivitamin and water  In the afternoon lunch: meat soup(It is called  urlLink Kalbitang , which is made of cow's rib, and rice.) a chocolate flavored popsicle (It tasted like a haagendazs' one.) a glass of iced coffee a glass of water two bites of craker  In the evening dinner: 2 pieces of seasoned fried chicken. (It is Korean styled spicy seasoning. Actually today was Bok-nal, when Koreans eat  urlLink Ginseng Chicken Soup  (or dogs soup) and watermelons to struggle against the hot weather.  Therefore Bok-nal is called the dog day. (However very very a little Koreans enjoy eating dogs. )  -------------------------- Conclusion : I had too much drinks. I have to reduce the frequency of drinking, but I want to drink cold beer now...... at hot summer night.

      There is an Korean proverb: Even a dog does not catch a cold in June and July, that is it is hard to catch a cold in summer. However alas! I caught a cold. I have ringing ear and a sore throat. = _ = I wanna get well soon! I hate to be dull.

      I met my friend today. We talked much drinking beer. (We all like to drink. I love drinking.) They were my highschool classmates. Though we are all unique, we know each other much so we are comfortable to talk about anything. Today's main topic was 'a man during travel'. One of them traveled Newzealand alone. She met a great guy there. He was a typical English man who is famous for kinderness and generous. (Actually it might be a streotype.) As she told me, he was so hot and coooool~ I wanna to meet such a guy ever. Anyway the friends I saw today are really fun. They are simillar to the characters in 'Sex and the City'. I consider the sistherhood we share is very very valuble. Like the friends of Sex and the City, I think we will meet often however busy we will be.

      Korea got a gold medal at judo game in Greece. The gold medalist's name is the same as mine. His name is  urlLink Lee Won Hee . My name is Park Won Hee. (We place the family name before personal name.) Now my father and brother are watching Olympic archery game. They are excited as the Korea is a superpower of archery. Most koreans love sports, so they are easily involved in watching sports games. Korean soccer is under easy sail now. Koreans are expecting that the team will get a good result as they did during 2002 Korea Japan Worldcup.

      I read many children's books. One of the book's titles is Rain, Rain, Go Away. Since the last Saturday, it have rained alot here. Everywhere is wet. I do like to watch raining scene. However I hate to get on buses on rainy days, expecially on Mondays. Traffic in Korea is so terrible(plus I have to commute for a long time, about 1.5 hours. It's really far far away.) that on rainy days the streets get full of cars. I become trapped in a traffic. Moreover in the morning, the bus is too crowded for me to sit, so I usually stand in the bus all the way. Naturally, we have much much rain in summer in Korea under the influence of typhoons and clashes of ais masses. Whenever typhoon comes here, many crops are demaged. Poor farmers! Korea has four distinctly four seasons: spring, summer, fall and winter, so farmers have only two seasons to plant their crops. However if too much rain falls in summer, their strrugle would be gone, boom! They could not ripe the farm products as they planted in spring. For my personal convinence and farmers effort, I want the rain to go away soon.  It's my spell - Rain, rain, go away.

      Our company will present new products to majoy buyers tommorow. Thereforee tommorow is an important day, so I decided to wear more formal dress than usual ones. I tried on my dresses kept in my closet for a while. (Our company has no dress code, so I usually wear jeans. ) ALAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I felt something weird. OH MY GOD!! The zipper did not work well and the dress seemed to have got smaller. Oh yea....that's it... I definetly gained some (or much) weight. It's terrible.  What shall I do to lose the unimportant part of my body? What is the key, working out or eating less? This subtle change of my body convince me to be on a diet.  I was so genorous to my weight that I have ignored my health and appearance. I am totally despressed.

      LemonCloud introduced me this  urlLink website   Your Existing Situation: Works well in cooperation with others. Needs a personal life of mutual understanding and freedom from discord.   Your Stress Sources: The tenacity and strength of will necessary to contend with existing difficulties has become weakened. Feels overtaxed, worn out, and getting nowhere, but continues to stand her ground. She feels this adverse situation as an actual tangible pressure which is intolerable to her and from which she wants to escape, but she feels unable to make the necessary decision.  Your Restrained Characteristics:  Circumstances are such that she feels forced to compromise for the time being if she is to avoid being cut off from affection or from full participation.Clings to her belief that her hopes and ideas are realistic, but needs encouragement and reassurance. Applies very exacting standards to her choice of a partner and wants guarantees against loss or disappointment. Able to achieve satisfaction through sexual activity   Your Desired Objective:  Needs to feel identified with someone or something and wishes to win support by her charm and amiability. Sentimental and yearns for a romantic tenderness.   Your Actual Problem : The tensions induced by trying to cope with conditions which are really beyond her capabilities, or reserves of strength, have led to considerable anxiety and a sense of personal (but unadmitted) inadequacy. She attempts to escape into a substitute world in which things are more nearly as she desires them to be. =============== I make what describes me bold. Is it me?

      I couldn't come my blog because I was far from my home and office. It was great trip and I had fun much! I will post some intersting pictures as soon as I get the files from my friend. Actually we don't like taking figure pictures, so we took picture of what we ate a lot cuz we ate many kinds of food. :) Maybe I got a few pounds.  As it was rainy, we did not go mountain, which was tantalizing. Though it rained, the open air spa was good.  Plus, a good new! One of my friend, who works for Arab Emirate Airline as a flight attendant, is home on leave. (We were at universiry together. She is beatiful and charming. I am proudd of her.) Tomorrow we are supposed to meet. I am excited cuz I have not seen her for 6 months. I missed her a lot.  Thanks to my good fellows, nowadays I am almost always happy.
