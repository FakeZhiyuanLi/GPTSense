      Well friends, it wasn't pretty but, after 3 hrs. of sleep I dragged my sorry butt out of bed to take on the mean streets of Venice, CA.  I joined my friends Samaya and Bianca to start training for the marathon.  We're part of a group called the L.A. Roadrunners (original, I know).  Do to a knee injury, I just walked today. Regardless, I'm very excited about everything going on over the next 6 months leading up to the race.  After training, we went on over to Robeck's (in the Nut) to toast our first day with shots of wheatgrass.  We even have our picture plastered on their wall.  It's not even noon yet and I've already had quite an eventful day.  Look for another post later today.  Until then, it's nap time!

      Hey Party People!  So, in about 4 hrs. I'm going to wake up to start training for the LA Marathon.  All I can say is, "Starbucks to forget!"  I'm excited about the marathon (it's my first) and right now my only goal is to finish.  It's quite encouraging that I'll be doing it with about 4 or 5 friends from work...including someone I've taken quite a liking to.  Well, I must attempt to get some rest in, but until next time, Ciao!     Question of the Day: How do you know if you are being driven by love or driven by fear?

      Well, I've never done a "blog" before so you'll have to grade me on a curve.  Today was another fun visit to the dentist.  Turns out, that tooth #27 (yes, it's that specific) needed a root canal.  To really be able to focus on that particular tooth, my dentist found it neccesary to use a dental dam.  All I could think of was sex ed. in high school talking about dental dams for oral sex.  If anyone I was with pulled out a dental dam, I wouldn't be able to run away fast enough.  My day was quite uneventful otherwise. Other news:  I am missing someone that is very important in my life. Recently, I had to "restrict" a friendship with someone I care deeply about because her fiance isn't such a big fan of me.  It really sucks but I know that things will work out for the best and that nothing is impossible :) Until next time, God bless and good night.
