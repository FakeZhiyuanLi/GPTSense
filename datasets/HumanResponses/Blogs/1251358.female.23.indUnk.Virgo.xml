      The entire fantasy is this: work, a fight, a file cabinet, and then suddenly mouth-on-mouth passion the likes of which the office would crumble for. Don't tell. The stench is overpowering and the body is too skinny. But still.

      Cucumbers in bed!  Ranch dressing of the dusk!  The vague blog-postings of the horniest.  Gandhi never had it like this.  Or this.  We needs a logo.  We wants one.  Feeling crimson, throw open the blonds!  And the blinds!

      Such a little bitch, boo hoo.  Here's a habit I'd like to break.  I feel asleep during HULK dvd.  She offends me, that actress.  No one just playing someone interesting's girlfriend should get Oscar.  Oscar should go to the bold.  Or a new award, named Rita.  He kisses like a diet Coke feels.  Empty?  Low calorie, maybe.  Silver.  Metallic.  Get a tic tac or take a hint.  Must we play The Clash whenever you're feeling frisky?  OOOOOOh OOOOOOh guns of brixton.  Friday Night's are allright for fighting also.  Now I'm in the middle of a young boy's dream, don't wake me up too soon.  Sox win!

      Phew.  Glad that's over.  How do you other girls put up with it?  My crushworthiness will not be televised.  Plus, I was too fucking low on the list to begin with.  I love the kid but hey I'm a sensation.  I nominate Lauren to rejoin the list, myself.  Hoo!

      I'd get rid of the sheep meat and put up a cute photo of myself here but I am haunted by thoughts of people jerking off over their keyboards at me and putting one across my virtual nose.  And I am hypothetically still taken.  Like in a friendster way "In a Relationship! Just Here to Help!" as his new poem says.  If he was rich I'd marry him and then take all his money and just wait for all the good poems to come rolling back.  But instead I'm stuck with the humanoid version of my dog: lying around and good for nothing but occasional cute looks and panting.  Remind me to paint "The Last Supper."  And to invent the wheel.

      smells like teen patchouli.  I want to put eyeblack under my green beauties just like Kevin Millar does.  Sigh or yawn?  Who gives a shit?

      This is a new kind of longing. The sucking in the pit of my stomach is filled with leaf after curly leaf continues to growl. I fantasize about vegetables that haven't been invented and vegetables I might become. Am I drooling? People are walking around in double time along short hallways. WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?  There's a future in medication; is it mine?

      That it was giant and had a squeaky voice and was after me although I was not scared.  And it was red.  I am waiting for  The Boston Herald  to print a large color poster of 2b Mark Bellhorn, that's how smitten I am.  Wolf whistle!  Goodfellas  gets funnier and funnier but it's creepy, too, so many Sopranos.  Leo trashed my closet because I was late and I need to get those little crumbly hamburgers you crumble up to make it up to him.  I wish vegetables would make salad dressing when you poured water on them like Leo's Gravy Train does.  Makes gravy.  So spins the meat this afternoon.  Although the blogclock is still wrong.  Terri Gross is playing nice music and there are many possibilities for a change.

      It seems to me like it's him being needy and me being incredibly reasonable and adorable.  As usual.  Spinach snakes through the teeth.  Sleeping makes you sleepy.  Salads can make you feel so alone.  The powder blue of the toes reminds you they're there.

      I did not want to fuck the CVS boy, I wanted to be fucked by the CVS boy.  Or just tangled up.  In his Scooby Doo bedsheets.  With him.  And his crooked but somehow beautiful cock.  In harsh morning light.  After having me bodice rrrrrrrriped.    Doing Piratespeak oncemore.  Arr!

      Sometimes I worry that my grandmother will get ahold of this. She can hardly see to read even the pulp paperback bodice rippers she used to love, but somehow someone will introduce her to the internet. She will immediately magnetically be drawn to my blog. And her cataracts will clear as if by magic.  "Astrid?" she'll gasp, "My Astrid?"  And she'll be horrified. She'll pass out right in her rocking chair that probably rocks too fast for her taste, due to arthritis and general fear.  But when she wakes up, she'll love it. This here blog is a bodice ripper.

      My cheeks are burnt methinks.  Thinking I should maybe post poems from my thing,  Wasp in the Gears of the Ocean .  Thinking I should maybe post them here (?).  Today I wanted to fuck the boy at CVS suddenly and vividly.  It's hard to remember why.  And I am limping around, too.  If you link link only to A.G..  Until I change the name of this to fuglyho dot blogspot dot com.  Almost typed fuglycunt etc.  I talk like that.  Unlady-like.  Forgive me Sister Whatshernuts for I have sinned and sinned.  Our Lady of Bland Childhoods smokes Parliaments.  See you in Polish Harlem.

      Eeeek.  He's done it.  I think I wish he hadn't.  I ought to let him know.  We're keepin' it--this here-- strictly on the D.L..  Because we here are sweet and lowdown and what happens when things stop getting polite and start getting real?  The stomach needs a carrot, but how big a carrot and from whom?  And when does the stick come out?  Speak softly and resist the urge to pet me as I go.  Isn't that the worst, you are simply going round the corner with your wonderdog and everyone simply must ride him like a pony and ask a million questions.  What kind of dog is this?  And only half are hitting on me.  This is not that kind of blog.  We still got the lampshade on.

      Links got provided, although we'll add and subtract.  And the blog name was an ironic hand-me-down.  The feeling that I've been backed into this somehow.  For my own good.  I've been vegetarian 10 years this month.  Do I get a cake?  Made of peas?

      Up so late there was no difference between sleeping and not.  You're only coming through in waves, dear.  A bad habit?  With nothing good to worry about we worry about ourselves.  I slept on a sock, which might be sleeping funny if it didn't hurt and if I had gotten any sleep.  So that's where the socks end up, somehow between the sheets you don't feel like sharing anymore.  Made for walking they say.  Angel hairy, what the throat remembers.

      A blog was asked for and so a blog was born.  Blanket apologies or caveats.  This is nothing but thoughts while the meat's aspin.  Welcome to whatever seems juicy in a hurry.

      i was dreaming that i arranged to be part of some sort of car wash for charity sort of thing, and was naked, of course. so this dude shows up and wants to take pictures with his digital camera, and i'm like "no way" and he won't leave until i let him take a picture, which i really do not want to do.  "i do not want to end up on the internet" i tell him. he says it's too late. there's already a whole website devoted to astrid goodyear's boobs & bits.  i go home to check it out, and sho'nuff there it is. boobs & bits. after a little detective work, i determine there are hidden cameras ALL THE FUCK OVER THIS APARTMENT. specifically in the track lighting. i do my best to stay covered with a sheet until the morning, when i can contact a lawyer.  so somehow i find the guys who are in charge of the cameras, and i think they're the guys who run the pizza place on the corner, only i just determined that now. they act all innocent and whatever, but i know it's them. and after many dream hours/days of arguing with them, some lawyers finallyshow up and make them take out all the cameras, which ruins the ceiling and the upstairs neighbors' floor. and they have to take down the website and stop using my name.  and the thing about it is, usually when i wake up in the middle of a dream, or start talking out loud, or whatever, the dream ends when i goback to sleep. only it didn't last night. it went on for a long long time. and i'm sorry i said you were good for nothing, but i couldn't believe you'd just lay there and sleep while i was being paraded all over the internet.
