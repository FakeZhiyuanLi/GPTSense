Bloody hell, 3 buses came and all were packed like sardine cans. . .then I thought, gonna be very late . . .ZzZ. . .but, lucky that the bus chiong. . .only late by 5min. . .      Now at com lab. . .doing C Prog. . .ZzZ. . .freezing here. . .and sleepy. . .yawned a few times already. . .then later got 4hr got CRS or in simple terms, English to go. . .boring crap. . .      --~^kEnBoA^~

During lectures, as usual. . .this time built Strike Eagles, my favourite fighter. . .that's how wild my mind can go. . .and test was even worse. . .my mind went blank the moment I saw the questions. . .lucky lecturer allowed usage of discman. . .or else I would have suffered even worse. . .      At least told someone why I'm not alright. . .erm. . .sigh. . .used to think that I'm immune to these problems. . .well. . .look at me now. . .    --~^kEnBoA^~

       I was thinking when will I stop thinking about all these? ? ? 5th week into the sch term yet I am still building additional castles and fortress in addition to the hundreds of castles and fortress built already. . .      And, when i reached my usual alighting point, met up the Lib gang ppl. . .here comes the intriguing part. . .I was dragged by them to the busstop for 269 without telling me what the blue freaking hell is going on! A point to note, Sherry was seemed to be surprised that I was wearing a polo-tee . . .=.-. . .    Only upon reaching the busstop, I got a slight idea on what was going on. . .but then I'm still in the dark. . .   when I know what was going on, I felt like "'-_-"'. . .   Jo said she got wrote the whole 'story' behind this thingy in her blog. .but I gathered nothing. . Jo, tomorrow tell me the thingy. . .    Sigh. . writing this blog instead of studying my test. . .ZzZ. . .heck it . . .see how much can I absorb before my eyelids submit to the force of gravity. . .      --~^kEnBoA^~
