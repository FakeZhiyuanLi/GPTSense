      So, there are less than 5 hours until the wonderful month of March.  So, I've decided to make a list of all the things that I'm excited about that shall be happening in March.  1.  John Mayer in Concert Saturday, March 20, 2004, Providence Rhode Island, 8:00 P.M. with special guests Guster with the fabulously awesome also-John-Mayer-loving cool kid Sar  2.  The entire day of March 20th in which we shall make a day of the concert and go to Providence Place and eat at one of many restaurants, possibly the Cheesecake Factory, which is pure excitement in itself  3.  Visiting Parker for the second year in a row for National Dresa Visits Parker Day  4.  St. Patricks Day for the pure joy of wearing a lot of green and the funny thought of dancing little men  5.  MY SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY March 31, 2004 (and to be precise, 3:59 P to the M)  We all know how super excited I get about this day, and I really don't care if people get annoyed with this fact because I l-o-v-e my birthday  6.  The weekend before my birthday during which my absolute best friends who are the coolest kids in the world and I shall literally have a fabulous par-tay in celebration of the fine day that will follow on the following Wednesday, the thirty-first of March  This month is going to be super uber cool.     To bad it is the longest month of the school year and I have way too many things to do that I am extremely not looking forward to.  These include:  1. My History term project- due Monday, March 15th  2. My English Critique due Thursday March 18th  3.  John-Jacob Jingle Hemier's Baptism  4.  Working on my year-long bio project  5.  Another English project  And I'm sure even more things than what I am aware of right now.    I love March  Also, if you are one of the many cool people who enjoy being enlightened by reading my blog, want to leave me a comment?  I think it is super cool when people read this, but I have no idea who does.

       B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E  So it has been quite a busy weekend, which was tres exciting.  On Friday, after I was told about 12,000 times that I am obsessed with matching, I came home and then hung around a bit, read a magazine I think.  Hmm, yeah that was fairly boring.  Then I went with my madre to Worcester Common Fashion Outlets, which is just about dead considering like every single store was closed and there were barely any people here.  But we went because she needed some new suits, so of course that meant I just walked around/sat in the suit store for at least an hour.  Then we went to The Sports Authority and I got a tennis racket, even though I haven't played tennis in about 5 years or more, but hey I like my racket.  Then we went out to eat at Racha Thai and we got some fabulous fish/shrimp food, so that was lovely.  Then we went to the store in Millbury  oops "The Shop pe s at Black Stone Valley"  and we went to Kohl's, which normally I really like, but I didn't really find anything and we went to to Target, which was fairly uneventful, and then we went to Circuit City to look for the ipod minis that they were supposed to have, but they didn't which was kind of dumb.  But I saw in an ad this morning that CompUSA has them so that is quite good.  Hmm then we came home I think and watched Gillies aka Gilmore Girls and I fell asleep with all my clothes on, which was fairly uncomfortable.    So then on Saturday morning, my mom woke me up a little after 8 and I felt so gross from sleeping without brushing my teeth and washing my face etc.  So I showered to make me perkier then Sar called and we decided that we really didn't want to be tortured by boring yoga with a sketchy teacher and that we just wanted to work out instead. So we did, then we went over to my brothers soccer game, but went in the car and listened to John Mayer instead of watching.  And we found about 1,000 different maps and travel guides and I learned that Tiger Woods' real first name is Eldrick so that was exciting (except not). And so then we got some Wendy's for lunch and rotted our insides with a lot of French Fries (haha remember when we were supposed to call them Freedom Fries).  Anyways, so then we went to the softball clinic at Chocksett and we were sooooooo confused about what we were supposed to do, since we are going to be  helping  with the little girls in the instructional league.  And then they made us sit through his boring boring boring coaches clinic in which a guy named Ralph talked extremely boringly about softball.  And I realized that Sar definitely had ADD 1,000 times worse than me, and everybody enjoys telling me how short my attention span is.  So then, this was tres exciting, we found our purple dots on the wall underneath the booth that we always sat in  8th grade!  Hmm then we hit with pitching machine and looked at the trophies form the 70's that Chocksett has (except in the opposite order).  Then we left finally and dropped Miss Sar off, even though I was going to see her again in like 3 hours.   So then I went home and realized I officially needed to retire from my basketball playing-ness because I was sooo sooo bad.  Then I did my French homework and finished my book for English, which I still need to discuss with Miss Carolina.  Hmmm then I changed and put on some mascara (random) and ate some spinach pizza which is always soo good, but I got a humongous chunk of spinach stuck in my teeth and I looked so incredibly like a hillbilly.  So then I went back to Sar's house before the Sutton vs. Parker girls varsity basketball game and we listened to John Mayer (obviously) and I saw her pretty new room which was fabulous.  Then Kelsey came and we sat around until we were ready to go.  So then we went.  Obviously. Then haha this is funny.  When we got there we had to park in the Parker parking lot (try saying that 5 times fast) and we decided to follow some guy with those shiny things on his shoes across a field as a short cut.  We didn't bother to realize that with the extremely mucky ground came an enormous puddle and our feet got so wet.  And Sar was so brilliant and wore flipflops.  So that was joyous, except not,  but at least memorable.  So then we went to the game and Parker lost by quite a bit, which was sad and all the girls were crying, and I felt really bad.  But before that Sarah definitely got very aggressive (like the whole be aggressive cheer) and plotted to take out about half the people in the gym.  Especially one girl on the Sutton team who was way to good for her own good.  Hmm then we came home and that was normalness and we were all really tired.  Hmm then I came home and watched UCONN lose to Villanova for the 2nd time in 2 years, which was really frustrating.  Hmm then I went to bed and slept until 10 this morning.  I was waken up by my mother who called to say that she would be home soon after my brothers baseball practice, which was at 7 this morning.  Lovely for him.  Then I had some pancakes and tacon and watched Best Week ever and now I am here, and not much more eventful has happened.  Today I might go to a movie, or work on my homework like I probably should.

      Instead of posting something completely boring about my totally uninteresting life.  I leave you Jason Mraz's fairly hilarious description of Japanese toilets and attacks of Godzilla and Japanese 101 with Professor Mraz:  thursday february 26   Godzilla is Coming!!!  Tokyo’s got it together. Composure. Convenience. Cold fish. Commodes. From vending machines that serve and service anything to heated toilet seats that treat your backside with pride and dignity. Tokyo is the future, 17 hours into the future to be exact.  When I first came to this great city and needed relief from a long flight, I sat and searched for the right words to describe the sensation I wasn’t expecting. I’ve come up with one word so far. Salvation.  First of all, upon entering, the seat is raised automatically for you by the power of god or whatever, but before sitting one needs to prepare the bowl by pressing the aptly named preparation button on the wash-let control panel, the remote unit parallel to the plastic/porcelain pot. This feature heats the seat and stirs up fresh water like a mountain stream in springtime. After one completes his or her task, which needs no explanation or instruction, you are offered two choices as to what you’d like to do next with the robotic bidet, hot or cold. You may control the intensity of the spray to your liking, starting slow to adjust to the shocking temperatures aimed at your heart by way of the lower intestines. Some, more sanitary seats provide a blow-drying option to ease the cleaning before pulling up, but most suggest you use the old-fashioned paper method to absorb the remaining droplets of condensation collected on your can. When leaving the rest area you can count on there being automated soap, water, and hand dryers to ensure you collect no germs on your way out. The only thing missing is an automatic exit door to escape those moments left by the few who pass up the hand-washing portion of the visit to the water closet. I think it should be required to rinse before returning to work. Alarms should sound upon egress, or doors should remain locked until the deed is done. That’s just me.  It was Toca’s birthday the other day. Happy Birthday! He turned 32 again. Go figure. We went out for sushi. He hates sushi. So we humored him and went to an ordinary pub for steaks and cheeseburgers and fries at his request. The place was too small for all 13 of us to sit. We didn’t last long and eventually compromised on a place that served chicken as well as sushi. If there’s one way to Toca’s heart, it’s through his stomach. I feel sorry for any poultry that comes anywhere near Mr. Rivera’s chokehold. Toca certainly knows how to choke his chicken.   I turned on the TV this morning as I was waiting for photos to upload to add to these recent writings. (I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but that’s the new feature to these curbside prophecies, corresponding photographs. A picture can say 1000 words but it can also inspire you to write 1000 more.) So I turned on the moving picture machine to find exactly what I’d expect on Japanese television, a Godzilla looking creature being wrestled to the ground by a suspicious looking Power Ranger character, crashing into miniature buildings and setting them afire with every leap and stumble through their poorly choreographed chaotic dance of catastrophic proportions. I couldn’t understand what the onlookers were saying or why the two were fighting and causing more damage than if just let alone. The creature had drawn on angry eyes and therefore, I assume, deserved to be destroyed. There’s no room in this world, or any fantastical universe for that matter, to carry aggression. Rage against the machine! Rage, rage against the dying of the light! Turn off your televisions! Look out the window! Godzilla is coming!  As intended, we played a great show in Shibuya. This was our second adventure as a live act in Tokyo. I was a bit less intimidated by my little understanding of the language and I let it rip, trusting that whatever wasn’t exactly understood could still be interpreted by my actions and overall mood. I think it went over well. If not, I threw enough guitar picks into the crowd to feed their hunger for substance. I did learn of a few words though, ordinary sayings made simple enough for even me when trying to blend in. I’ll share some with you in case you ever find yourself over here and are looking to make friends of the Japanese variety.  Japanese 101 with Professor Mraz Let’s jump straight into conversation to see how these handy phrases make sense on the street. Pair up and read these aloud with your partner, alternating lines. When you get through, switch turns and practice the reenactment from the other person’s perspective. If you don’t have a partner, make up a silly voice to be the opposing character in the conversation.  Konnichi-wa! Good day! Komban-wa! Good evening! Genki datta? How’s it going? Ammari. Okay, I guess. Doka shita-no? What’s wrong? Shigoto taihen isogashii. I’m really busy with work. Taihen-dane. That’s a bummer. So omou. I think so too. Nihongo hanaso. Let’s talk in Japanese. Demo, eigo sugoku jozu-ne. But your English is so good. Nanka itte. Say something. Nani ni-tsuite hanashiteru-no? What are you talking about? Nyan-nyan. Cat meowing. Mo ikkai itte. Say again? Nani-mo ittenai-yo. I didn’t say anything. Honto-ni? Are you sure? Atama-ga fura-fura. My head feels dizzy. Sugoi. Awesome. Damaso-to shiteru desho! I think you are trying to trick me! Kichigai! You’re crazy! Konna-ni takai-wake nai! This can’t be so expensive! Michi-ni mayotta. I’m lost. Amerika-jin dakara? Is this because I’m an American? Kore wa honto janai desho! This can’t be right! Karaoke suki? Do you like karaoke? Suwatte-mo-ii? May I sit down? Tanoshimo-yo! Let’s party! Yotteru? Are you drunk? Tanoshii-yo. Yeah, I’m having fun. Okutte ku-yo. I’ll take you home. Kirei-na karada-dane. You have a beautiful body. Shitteru. I know it. Anata-ga hoshii. I want you. Daijobu. It’s gonna be okay. Kisu shite-mo ii? May I kiss you? Atashi-wa anata-ni fusawashikunai-wa. I’m not good for you. Gomu tsukeru. I’ll use a condom. Hisashiburi. It’s been a long time. Li kaori. You smell sweet. Mo sugu deru. I’m leaving soon. Zutto issho-ni itai. I wanna stay with you forever. Tai-kara denwa suru. I’ll call you from Thailand.  Aishiteta. I loved you. Sore-wa ato-de hanaso. Let’s talk about it later. Nyan-Nyan! Nyan-Nyan! Cat meowing! Cat meowing! Ki-o-tsukete-ne. Take care. Tokoro-de, Nihon-no kekkon-shikitte ikura-karaku-no? By the way, how much does a Japanese wedding cost?  There, you’re good to go! Of course some of the variations relate specifically to masculine or feminine, but Mraz’s language course is designed to disassemble any barriers and better us into becoming one happy human species rather than remaining complicated with strict gender related rights or lack thereof currently. I can think of a few politicians and a president who could stand to take my class, can you?  Another thing I caught on TV today was the news, and it seems the banning of same-sex marriages is quite the international issue. It seems we have a president who chooses not to change the unconstitutional constitution and grant simple rights to those who may be truly in love, but insists on sealing the constitution for good with an all out ban on the issue. If you’ve never contacted your congressman before, now is an excellent time to exercise one of your last constitutional rights and defend nothing more than love. This isn’t an issue about going against god and ancient mythology, in fact, I believe it’s an act more towards god and good orderly direction, for the people and hopefully, by the people. And while you’ve got the president’s attention, remind him that the constitution that he’s so keen on protecting was printed on hemp paper. If there’s been any act that’s gone against god, it’s been the criminalization of those who happen upon cannibus, the natural byproduct of mother earth loving it’s native inhabitants and vice versa. In the name of war for oil, let’s look into natural alternatives already. I pray the next time I turn on the news I see a miracle and that a brave new president has realized it is the love of the people that equates to power, not money, an army, nor a sophisticated weapons program. If we don’t see this then perhaps something as entertaining, like Godzilla crashing through mansions on Pennsylvania Avenue, not meaning harm to man, just doing what is necessary to scare it’s residents away and reintroduce democracy to the once honorable district. We can learn something from Japan just from their toilet seat ceremonies. Treat every ass**** with respect...  Is this weird? I’m usually not one to paste my opinion on such specifics but this is something I feel strongly about, as a citizen of the United States, and presently as someone who is representing the country abroad. I am proud of my home but feel like we could stand to improve upon a few things, and the only way we will ever reach a happy medium is by creating a dialogue on such topics. Every opinion matters. You matter. Whether you agree with me or not, practice speaking up and inform others of your beliefs. This is a freedom not everyone in this world has, but if we use it wisely and steadily and can make an honest difference then I believe someday we can lend a supportive hand to other countries instead of sending them our stomping foot. Let’s all just move to Japan. That would be easier. Here is peace. Here is polite. Here is perfect. Here is God, even if it is only Godzilla. I’m really happy to be here. …Wish YOU were here.

      It's really really weird.  It seems like this afternoon is actually going by slowly.  Not in a  bad way at all.  And I got home at normal time too.  It just usually seems that like when I get home the afternoon from like 3-5 flies by and I don't even realize it, and then it's dark out and it feels like I have no time before I go to bed.  And I'm sure that part will be true, but for now I am enjoying our long afternoon.  Even though I have an absolutely gigantic history test tomorrow and I really want to finish my book for English, but I have to write my discussion response reflections stuff first or else I'll get too confused I think.   Lovely.  A lot and really nothing at the same time happened today, so it was kind of one of those weird days.  OK that sounded so dumb but I really don't care.    I think I'm still waiting for my life to start.

      So, today was ok I guess.  School was so incredibly long, though.  I had English first, which normally goes by pretty fast, but today went by way too slow.  I was super happy, though, because I got two A's on my Illumination Night reflections, even though I thought one of them was just o.k.  She must have been in a really good mood.  I hadn't gotten and A in that class on anything since like September on my Ruby story that everyone so nicely likes to make fun of.  So that was e-x-c-I-t-I-n-g (you would laugh at me if you knew how long it took me to write that exciting right there).    So, then I had Bio and that was dumb but we did nothing and went off on all sorts of "crazy" tangents about cancer and such.  Then in  History I wicked love my group for our Peace conference -me, Kim (who always seems to be in my group), and Ben.  We got the U.S. and it is so incredibly easy, we just laughed at the other groups, mostly France, actually.  Oh god, tomorrow is Valerie and Steph's (oh no! I spelled your name wrong.  Poor Stef Miss "Actually, It's the original Latin form".  Well, yes, so their SCI is tomorrow and I am so so not happy about having to sit through and entire class of the most annoying talking people in our whole class.  Fun Stuff.    Hmm... ah yes.  Then I had French and we had to do Suivez la Piste, and it went  absolutely awfully, even though we listened to it three times.   (Carolyn you can skip the next part) Haha so here comes the only funny part of the day.  At lunch, Miss Carolina and I were discussing art class/clay because I had art long block and got mine back.  So apparently, in eighth grade, she made a containerish thing with a butterfly on it.  It was all butterfly-y shaped and even had a smiley face.  So she decided to add a handle to it.  A big, long handle that stuck out right in the middle of the butterfly.  Yeah, right there.  And it was painted orange.  Naughty miss Carolyn, apparently all the boys made fun of it and were like "What is this?" and started laughing and such.  And to make it worse, it is still on her kitchen table.    Yes so then art and math were normal.  In art, I finished glazing my snowman but math was so so so so long, even though I'd already been warned about how boring it was.  But, I did get a 100 on math test that a lot of people didn't do to well on, so that was cool with me.  Then I walked up the hill, came home blah blah blah boringness.     That was so boring, why did I even make myself relive it?

      So I am eating a Rice Krispies Treat.  It's quite yummy but also very bad for me and I should stop eating it.  But it is about the only festivity in this otherwise such boring day.  I just finished my first essay for history and it is dumb but I used a lot of big words (for me) and so that is lovely.  Now, I must read the 60 or so pages that I still need to read from my book for my history term project.  And after that I need to write a whole other essay, again for history.  Then I shall need to read about 60 or so pages for English too (whish I must admit is more enjoyable but still something I'm forced to do).  This is going to be a long day.    So, also, yesterday my mother and I went to Wrentham after the BC vs. UCONN basketball game, which was super cool and I saw Miss Sarah there so that was also cool.  So at Wrenthem, my mother needed to find a new suit at the Kasper store because she has a lot of meetings in Boston this week.  So, actually the one she chose was quite nice, but it is amazing how long people can spend in a suit store.  We were in there for over an hour, definitely.  It's really weird because one of the ladies who works there, whom I now know is named Allison, I definitely remember from the last time I was there and it was just weird.  Even weirder was that I remembered that she has a son named Tristan, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how I knew that, so that was weird.  So after that long long long-ness in the suit store, we went to a Puma store, but it was not cool at all like our wicked super cool Puma outlet.  Then we went to the Gap outlet and I got a really pretty black short sleeve shirt that is really hard to describe, but yesterday was the day that we first started shopping for my birthday, which was uber cool, but that means that I don;t get to have my lovely shirt or the cool denim capris that I got at Old Navy until my birthday.  I found the coolest olive green capris that I loved, but they only had one pair an d it was a size too small so I definitely wasn't super psyched about that one.  Then we ate at Chili's again and came home and I can't remember what else I did after that.  Oh yeah, I think I just read my magazine that I got yesterday.  It had a really sad story about this school that has had so many deaths in just a few months.  It was so sad.  Then I went to bed.  Lovely.

      So you know what else bothers me?  The fact that  most  every single song I listen to can either be really optimistic or really depressing, but not both at the same time.  It's really weird, it's like the meaning of the lyrics changes depending on what kind of mood I am in.  Right now they seem kind of depressing, probably the reason being that I'm bored more than anything.  But then the song changes and it sort of ruins my point, but not really I guess.  Well, it's just something I've noticed.   Anyways, yes, so my family a.k.a. the wonderful group of people who just get along so mightily well *cough* decided to take a nice little "mini-vacation" to Connecticut.  Well, let me tell you, that long car ride with way too small of a space with some completely annoying person (my father, if you didn't figure it our yet) who is completely obsessed with hearing himself talk while other people were trying to relax made the car ride really pretty aggravating.  I definitely listened to so many CD's that my ears kind of started to hurt in that way that they do when you've been listening to your headphones for too long.  And I read for history, but I still have at least 50-60 pages to read but w/e I don't even care.  And not to mention those essays... Oh well Sunday will be fun, except not :-\.    So we went to visit Wesleyan College, which basically seems pretty boring, well it was sort of bland, because the winter does that to things, but they had a big hill that it looks like it would be fun to slide down after a snow storm.  I realized today as I was sitting in the car, that I definitely have S.A.D.D., seasonal activated depression disorder, or something like that (if someone wants to clear up exactly what it stands for that would be nice) because I noticed that the sky was really gray and I felt that if it was bright blue and summer/spring I would be really happy.  That sounds really weird, but it's true.  Also, I hate how dark it gets so early in the winter, I just feel like I have no time and nothing is as enjoyable.  It's actually kind of funny that I look forward to mud, because that's about the first sign of spring for me.    So, anyways, back off that tangent.  Then after we went to Wesleyan, we went and visited Yale.  The campus is beautiful.  It has a lot of really old architecture with a sort of medieval look to it.  I just really liked how it was set up and everything.  That's definitely the kind of campus I want to have when I go to college.  Some parts sort of look like Hogwarts, which of course is so cool.  You know it.  I decided that the top 3 things I want to have at whatever school I go to are:  1. Trees  2. Starbucks  3. The ability to study abroad  I totally want a beautiful campus and I definitely want to be one of those people who lounges around on the grass in the Springtime and I actually love the whole cafe atmosphere and you don't even know how psyched I am to study abroad.  I am looking forward to it so so much.  So, yes, those three things are what I want the most.  O tot he K, so back to my sort of nonexistent story.  After skipping some boring stuff in the middle, so we went to our hotel in New Haven and there was this whole ordeal with the indoor pool that they were supposed to have but didn't really, but it sort of long and boring and I don't feel like getting into it.  So for dinner we went to Chili's, where I'd actually never been and I got this Caribbean salad that was so so so so so so times a million good.  So that was exciting, and then um whatever the rest of our hotel stay was kind of normal and unexciting and I slept awfully like I always do at hotels.  So then this morning after we left the hotel we went to New London which is near Mystic down along the South Eastern Connecticut coast and we drove around for like an hour to try to find Connecticut College and then we finally did, but none of us were feeling all that well, so we kind of just drove around.  It was nice but not that appealing to me, kind of like a take it or leave it type of thing.  But I got a banner type poster so that was super exciting.  And then nothing else particularly interesting happened for the rest of the ride back.    My brother had been collecting change for about his whole life and he put it in those little rolls and exchanged it at the bank today.  He got $93.  That is c-r-a-z-y.  So I kept telling him over and over that he needs to get me a birthday present with that money and he wasn't very appretiative of that, but I do hope he gets me something super duper cool.    I am still trying to figure out what I'm going to want to do with my awesome fabulous coolio toolio friends for my birthday, but I'm really not sure yet.  My mom suggested pedicures and going out to eat, which could be fun.  I think I want to go out to eat again, but there aren't really that many good places too close to here.  So basically I have no idea what we're going to do, but I am still super excited about it anyways.  Only 1 month exactement until the John Mayer concert.  Seriously I am so incredibly excited for that.  (Right now I think Meliss will leave me another "John Mayer... eww" post, but I'll look forward to it anyways.)  But I am super excited.  I think I feel like giving myself a nice little pedicure/manicure maybe so I shall be off to do that I think.  I really want a light blue/aqua/turquoisey color but I don't actually have that color, so something else shall have to suffice.    It took me over an hour to write this (with a short break in the middle)

      I had totally forgotten about my love for the word  ERGO  until just now.  "Ergo, another blanket" totally the best line from A Walk to Remember.  It's just one of those words that makes me laugh.    So, anyways.  Today was kind of boring again, but I did watch  Freaky Friday  and  My Big Fat Greek Wedding , which I must say I never thought lead up to all the hype it got.  My favorite part was with the pimple and the Windex and the part where Niko and Angelo make Ian say "I have three testicles" in Greek.  And, of course, Freaky Friday is just cool and I really really want to see  Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen  soon, it comes out on Friday I believe.  I actually read the book like years ago or something, but I totally forgot about it until I read a thing that the movie was based on a book, so now I sort of remember.    Also, I ate a turkey roll-up with some cranberry sauce in it.  Lovely.  And I put some more birdseed out so the little birdies don't starve to death (or maybe more because my mom wanted me to do it).  I packed for going to Connecticut this morning.  We are leaving tomorrow morning and staying over until Friday and visiting some colleges and stuff.  I think it shall be good, especially just to get out of the house, because I haven't really left the house for a along period of time for a few days.    I really want to see  Ten Things I Hate About You  again.  It is such qual-i-tay.  I must say that I absolutely detest Gran on Gilmore Girls.  She is just so aggravating and I didn't miss her.  I would never even be able to think of responses like she gives.  I am super excited to here about Seth's flopping around like a fish out of water with Summer on the O.C. because we all know how incredibly cool Adam Brody is.

      The cool-but-never-been-kissed club= Me Meliss Sar Leah (although she doesn't want to admit it, she's joining anyways)   Just remember this is  NOT  THE  dumb-so-they-never-will-be-kissed club that some should belong.  Choose your club carefully, my friends.

      I'm not really in a cleansing myself kind of mood like Meliss, but I guess I could add a few things.  Let's see, here are a few things to consider, but most awesome people already know.       Actually, you know what?  I'm definitely not in a cleansing mood.  But I will say that many many people annoy me and I enjoy making fun of them with my other wicked cool and not at all annoying  amies , but that's only once in a while.  But things in general annoy me way too much and I really need to not get so aggravated and annoyed all the time.  Because I know I do.    Way too much.       Other things I do like way too much are Mary-Kate and Ashley Movies and ranting to people who I know don't want to listen to me rant but will let me anyways. Plus I definitely like a boy I've never talked to way too much for never talking to him.  Yeah really should work on that one.  But good things that I get way too into are John Mayer, Gilmore Girls, and my birthday.  But that's all very evident.    I've never been kissed either.  Maybe me and Meliss should start a club.  You can sign up to join if you are wicked cool like us.    OK now that was all very forced cleansing, it's more random things about wicked cool Andrea that I'll let people can know if they wish to.

      The mysteries of life=  1. Why people have to be stupid and annoying and spell "SHOP" as "SHOPPE".  It is dumb and annoying and completely unnecessary.  Even the spell check wants me to replace it with the normal spelling.  That has to tell you something.  2. That our creepy yoga teacher is really Taylor Dosi from Gilmore Girls, even if he doesn't wear sweaters with leather elbow patches  I forget the rest, but they were solved today.  I've decided I must start planning my birthday and parties and such now because it actually is not too far away.

      I was excited about hearing "Clarity" on the radio in the car today.  I think it is very under rated and it had definitely grown on me since I first got the CD (John Mayer "Heavier Things", that is).  I went to Leominster movie theater with Sar and Hannah and their friend Kelsey to see "50 First Dates" and it was actually really good, way better than any of us thought it would be.  And we hung around near all the sketchy ghetto people before Mrs. Sushchyk picked us up.  Not with them, just near them: big big difference there.  I saw Sara Winkler and her boyfriend (so random) and then we examined my data match and talked about annoyign people from middle school on the way home.  It was a par-tay.  Good nighty, lovey dove.

      I just saw Jessie's Girl on I love 81.  I think VHI follows me or something because they seem to always play these things when I had just talked/thought about them the day before.  It's because I'm so cool like that.  jk.  Anyways, well today has been lovely boring but I guess it's o to the k with me for today.  I am like half way done with my first history essay.  It's quite easy, so that's good.  I read a really long and extremely boring chapter in my otherwise fairly interesting book for history.  I've read 3 chapters of about the 10 I have to read.  Joy.  I'll probably read mostly in the car going to Connecticut on Thursday, though, which I'm sure will be a par-tay.    I was waken up at about 8 this morning, which I wasn't entirely happy about because I was way to tired to get up, so I just kind of lounged in my room until the "late" hour of 8:45.  Then I don't really remember what else I've done.  So, yeah, that was my summary of my altogether boring morning, enjoy.  I'm going to the movies later with Sar and other cool people and we are seeing "50 First Dates."  Par-tay on!    I realized this morning that Mischa Barton is way too tall and has quite gross teeth.  It was not a lovely realization.

      This is so pathetic.  I'm sort of addicted to this blog at the moment.  I've been talking online for like an hour continuously and it is sort of making me tired.  Leah is being stalked by a crazy man who's heart is racing to say I love you and Miss Carolina is going to read up on her daily history quota that is now mathematically correct.  Oh my.  I am so tired and it is officially 8:28 at night.  This is pathetic too.  I really want some Valentine's cake that I baked yesterday.  It's even heart-shaped.  Woo hoo exciting.  I really wish I had something to do but I'm in that weird tired state that I don't want to do anything that takes much effort.

      Later.  I took part in Cole's experiment about if the type of music you listen to while doing math problems affects your performance.  We had Dixie Chicks (kind of scary... I did the worst on that part), Linkin Park (I could never listen to even "light" rock music, too angry, but I did the best on that part) and Michelle Branch, which was much more to my liking (although it should have been Mr. John Mayer for that part I think.  LOL.  And I definitely haven't done subtraction and definition and those types of math problems by hand since about 6th grade, so that was actually quite challenging.  Mr. Pokemon Jessie's girl (hahaha my mom spelled his name, Jesse as Jessie and he got mad) calls out "Oh this will be no problem for me, I'm in Pre-Calculus."  Well, aren't you just so cool Mr. Know It All.  I think all of us in that class would think it was a little hard because we just do it on la calculatrice anyways. So I hope you lose Mr. I Take Pre-Calulus.  Oh my this night isn't even over and I'm definitely annoyed.  Haven't started those torture plans yet, though...    Anyways, also I am uber happy that I got to burn the new Norah Jones CD from my mom's friend Carlene.  The CD is so mellow, I love it.  Especially with how aggravated we all know I get.  Then I burned her the Josh Kelley CD so I can spread the love.   I saw pictures of a dog that looks like a fox, but she's sort of cute I think.  She's one of those dogs from the Sterling Animal Shelter that get rescued from Puerto Rico like the one that the cute old couple whose house I always go to during YAHOO have.

      So I'm sitting here and I am freezing but I am wearing a shortsleeve shirt so that is probably my fault and I am listening to some random Ari Hest song "You're The Only One" actually trying to forget the picture of my father attempting to dance to "Lose Yourself" by Eminem which he listens to by playing the end credits of the DVD of 8 Mile that he has rented about 12,000 times from the library but never actually watched and he still hasn't actually learned the words to the song yet.  He just says "the music, the music" over and over and over and jumps around with his probably $50 in change in his pockets.  It's quite pathetic.  It's not as pathetic actually as how incredibly cold I am.  But I'll stop complaining about that now because it is probably very annoying.   And so I'm so so not excited about Jessie's girl and Cole coming over (with their parents, of course, aka my parents' friends).  I cannot stand Jessie's girl aka Pokemon boy aka Jedidiahish annoying tender legs (don't ask) and I think I shall definitely use Sar's idea to plot every way I can figure out how to torture him as we eat later.  But I would never do that because I'm such a nice girl.  Usually I am, some people just aggravate me and then I make up mean names for them, but I'm allowed.    Also, if you want a good time, watch Footloose to get in touch with your inner 80's.  It's not actually a very good movie but it is just so dated that I loved it.  So I've badgered (did I just make that up, wait I don't think so) my mother endlessly since we watched that movie on Friday about the 80's and I've come to realize that I'm happy I didn't have to live through it because it sounds very very odd, but I still believe that all those hours of "I love the 80's" have paid off.  Especially how I now compare things to popular 80's toys such as chia pets, weird things.   My mother was super nice yesterday and gave me this wicked good CD (Josh Kelley "For the Ride Home") and the Puma pants that I picked out a little while ago for Valentine's day.  She is a sneaky lady.  My pants make me look like I am a life guard but I wicked heart them.  And my CD is basically another clone of all the other music I listen to but it's really good so I'd recommend it I think.   Going to clean for the soon to be tortured Pokemon boy and others to get here.  I'm excited.

      Today is my birthday and I l-o-v-e it.  When I got up this morning, my mom made me French toast for a special breakfast and she put a birthday candle in each piece and sang Happy Birthday to me and made me blow out the candles.  It was tres cute.  Meliss and Carolyn made me signs for my locker so I felt soooo special and everybody knew it was my birthday and said Happy Birthday randomly, even if I hadn't told them, but b/c they had seen the signs, which was a little weird but perfectly acceptable :-).  In French somebody (Jacqui?) told Mme Sanfacon that it was my birthday so then the whole class sang "Joyeuse Anniversaire" and that was cool.  In math I didn't have to take the last quiz since I had gotten 30/30 on all of the previous ones, so that was an added bonus.  I had gym long block which was pretty bad.  We played basketball and soccer, neither of which I am too good at.  It was pretty boring to be honest.   Then I had lunch, which was long and uneventful and had a gross apple (random). English last=Animal Farm quiz that I think I got 100 on.  woot woot.  *leaves to check on cookies in oven* o.k. back.  Yes, good cookies, but could have possibly been cooked a little less.  So, then on the bus, I was sort of nervous we were going to have to walk home in the pouring rain, which really would have stunk, but we ended up getting a ride so that was fantabulous.  So, after that I hung out with myself (fun stuff) and listened to the message Sar left me on the answering machine which made me happy and read some more of the driver's manuel so I can get my permit soon.  And listened to John Mayer.  But I do that everyday.  So, now I am trying to figure out where we shall go out to eat tonight in celebration of this lovely day.  And then hopefully come home and get some lovely gift-age.  I really really hope I get the green mini ipod I've been in love with for months, but they don't seem to have had them in any stores, so I'm not sure if I'll get one tonight.  But I will sometime around now. OK going to do more lazy birthday things and I shall update y'all later on my gift-age and such.

      Improv in English long today was so fun.  And Nick and his preference comment was priceless.  Joe trying to act ditzy did not work, but it was really fun.  MCAS was dumb, but that's ok, it's done for now.  I talked to the other cool kid on the phone and she sang me half of happy birthday, so phone hug to you!  I am so so excited for tomorrow.  My mom even said she would get up early and make me French toast for breaky fast since her little baby is all grown up.    Boys are dumb and just need to go away.  Please.  Thanks.

      Today is Monday.  If you didn't know.  It is two day and 43 minutes before the moment that is 16 years after my day of birth.  It was a lovely day.  Boring art,math, tech (new partner= Sam), English even pretty boring.  Lab group in Bio= Mike/Jamie/moi.  ugh.  History=boring too.  OK, I guess it wasn't really all that lovely.  Other hopefully better highlights of my life include  Leah forgot her "glasses" at my house  I am wearing my lovely white Dr. Scholl's sandals which are so much cooler than my three driver's manuel books  I have $131 to spend on whatever I wish  I want warmth outside so bad  got a pretty bracelet  watched myself smack my head against the cedar chest on Christmas '89 50,000 times for everyone to laugh at, including myself  Got some cool stuff for my French par-tay  ok, sorry but sick of typing, maybe I'll try again later

      I hate how some days I am so exhausted that I can barely do anything for 20 minutes after I get home and feel the need to take a nap, usually from like 3 to 6 or something.  Then, when I wake up, even if I have a little bit more energy, I am insanely starving and always have awful headaches.  So, then the rest of  my night is ruined because I have so much less time to do my homework and I constantly feel like I am going to throw up and can't even concentrate on my homework anyways.  And then, later, I can't fall asleep at night since I had just slept that afternoon.  Then, the next day, I am just as exhausted as I was the day before.  I hate it.  Why am I always soo tired?  Ad the thought of being productive for the whole day without being exhausted is inconceivable to me.  Jeez, but I can't have caffeine or anything because it makes me even more tired and gives me pounding headaches.  Any suggestions on how to get over my extreme tiredness all the time?   My mom brought home 3 driver's manuels today... 3, does she realize there's only one of me?

      So, this is really random, but I think it is pretty cool.  So, see the ads at the very top of the page that say "ads by Google" or something like that.  Well I never really noticed it before but apparently google sort of scans you entries and does a quick ad search and then adds those ads to you page.  For example, on Melissa's I saw 2 ads- one for pepper spray/mace and the other for security b/c she wrote about her parents wanting her to be safe and wanting to get pepper spray.  Mine had/has ones about party supplies and Holiday Season tours, except I don't really know where that one came from.  But w/e.  Yeah, so that is my interesting insight for the day.  Enjoy.

      John Mayer was  AMAZING !    He is my idol and my lover and I seriously think I  would   have his babies.  They would be some mighty talented children.    My favorite song was Why Georgia (in case you were wondering).  Also, though slightly unnecessary, but very funny, I enjoyed the added descriptions of his masturbating to a picture he drew as a teenager, how music and sex are basically exactly the same, and how to best make a nonalcoholic drink look like it's straight up booze.    Also, he wasn't as ugly in real life! Woo!  OK, more details later....

      My favorite ways of procrastinating aujourd'hui include:  1.  Downloading and listening to "shared" John Mayer songs such as "Lifelines", "Area Codes", "Break Away", and most interestingly, Mr. Mayer's lovely rendition of "Pop" by *NSYNC, which leads nicely into a lovely version of Room For Squares.  It's actually hugely funny, you might wish to sneak a listen from al those lovely sharing obsessed people who live in that little place we like to call iMesh world.  2. Reading some random people's Ujournals, but the funny thing is that I probably only talk to these people about once a month, because I don't really know them at all.  But I do know what they were doing on Monday, March 1, 2004 at 7:54 P.M.  I could bring it to court if I must.    Now preparing to procrastinate some more by looking up some festive French party games/food/ideas online.  Lovely.

      Meliss had a wicked awesome idea today at lunch that I should have a French themed birthday party and that's totally what I want to do now, since March 31st is also the Eiffel Tower's birthday and just because who wouldn't want to be wicked French for a day.  I am actually so excited because I really want to have a Eiffel Tower shaped birthday cake too.  And have everybody dressed French-like.  Off the shoulder shirts, berets, spiky little shoes, the works.  Oh and crepes.  My loves.  How does this sound?  Good I hope.  Oh man I'll have to make some French looking invites too.  Exciting.

      I am so exhausted.  I think it's the change in seasons, I really do.  I tend to be tired in the midafternoon anyway, but now I am just exhausted.  I can't wait until it is light our until nine and we have so much less homework and I can just relax and play softball with my awesome Sterling Police and go to our new condo in Maine for the weekends.  But for now I am stuck being too exhausted with too much work to do.    Yesterday, I got $100 out of the $300 that the diGrazias owed me from babysitting 2 summers ago.  Honestly, I was surprised she actually remembered exactly how much she owed me.  I could of gotten some money in interest in it had it been in the bank the past two years, but I guess just getting it is a big step.  I'll have to figure out something I really want and treat myself, but the few things I really really want I think I shall be getting for my birthday, hopefully.  So, yesterday I realized that there are only 3 weeks until my birthday par-tay and I still have no idea what I want to do to celebrate.  Leave a comment and help with ideas please!  All of them will be greatly appreciated!  Seriously need to figure out what I want to do right now.   Must go read for history because I am so far behind and my term project is due in a week and I definitely need to get working on it.

      I realized that today I had basically no social contact.  I talked to Carolyn only once and Meliss not at all.  Not on purpose, obviously, but that could come from the facts that  a.  I didn't have Bio or lunch with Miss Carolina today, thus limiting our contact to a very quick discussion of the math quiz (which I found to be not too hard, but I don't really understand what we're doing so I had to guess on a lot of things)  and    b. I never have any classes with Meliss, nor lunch today, (haha I said nor) and I lost both she and Carolyn this morning and studied for my math quiz while just sort of standing on the side of the hallway instead.     what a fabulously social enlightening day.  What makes this worse is that the entire 4th lunch that I had after tech long today, I was forced to listen to Abbie Staruk tell her stupid irrelevant stories and then say how she couldn't stand some of the  perfectly nice people and wants to tell her friend that she doesn't actually like her at all and just wants her to stop talking about completely irrelevant things, because apparently she doesn't care.  Sound familiar?  I don't care about your dumb little stories about Cuban exiles or your hatred for most every girl in our grade.  Thank you and have a nice life.   Tomorrow shall be quite quite busy- I'm babysitting at 4 and then going to a BC basketball game for 7.  So that means all of my time from 4 until 10 will be completely booked.  I shall be quite busy.

And we broke the base.  Nobody better ever fix that because it was broken by our amazingness.  Some girl on that team stole my name too.  *attempts to give Cherise's glare of death *  OC tonight.  Woot.   Got myself 3 new cds today.  Or orders for them from Sonja/Kiersten.  Two Dashboards and a Third Eye Blind. Blue.  Excellent.  Jess is coming back.  Love love love.

      For all of those people who are in an identity crisis (which I think is about all of us right now):    "Trying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth."   Which probably is even more confusing, but I think it basically says that you can't define yourself.  So I think we are all in one of those weird transitional stages because things just seem to be getting so complicated and I know I for one have no idea what I'm here for yet.    Hopefully we'll figure it out soon enough because I'm not really a big fan of identity crises

      Yahoo=blah  All boys and then me.  No Meliss, who was supposed to be in my group :(.  Oh well, there's always next week.  With Sar and Meliss.  Woot.    So, yesterday I got the John Mayer Any Given Thursday DVD.  I know you're all so jealous. I like it.    I burned my mom the Guster CD because she is obsessed with them and has been begging me for weeks.  I really want the Guster CD from before "Keep It Together"  I think it's called "Lost and Gone Forever" or something like that.    So, Maine was lovely.  Relaxing after we made the condo really look like our own.  We have to paint the two bathrooms.  We are going for a medium blue downstairs and I'm really really pushing for a light green, I hope I'll get my way.   I finished "Raisin in the Sun" for English.  I'm not sure it had a point.  I got this weird sort of little rash on one side of my nose, which is really bothering me, since I have no idea what it's from.    i read a surgery about plastic surgery.  It was disgusting.   Now, unpacking. I also really want the O.A.R. CD.  Lovely.

      I actually just started to notice that I am sometimes really sarcastic.  I never noticed, really, it's just part of who I am and usually it's not in a mean way i hope.  And if it is, well, we all know that sometimes I am mean too, neither of these things I can really help.  And that is in all seriousness.  Get it, like not sarcastic.  Oh wow *dorkness appears*.    I'm off to Maine in the morning.  Lots of work to do when we get up there, but it'll be nice to see the condo for the first time.  See y'all Friday or bright and early Saturday at Yahoo.  Joy.

      I officially love the song "The Reason" by Hoobastank. And generally I can't stand Hoobastank, so it must be an exceptionally good song.  In other news, I napped all day and the Redsox kicked Yankee buttocks.

      I need to start packing to go to Maine tomorrow through Friday.  We're closing on our condo tomorrow so then it will be ours all ours and we can have lots of wild parties.  Not actually, but maybe.  I need to shower, I'm dirty.  Then maybe I shall expose my pastiness to this day they say is 80 degrees.

      I hope y'all like what i did to my blog.  Very spring-like if I do say so myself.  While some people are in the Caribbean for vacation, I just spent an hour sitting at home making my blog look beautiful.  Wondrous.  It might last longer than a tan though.  Maybe ;-).  Real updation shall occur tomorrow, because I know that I've been neglecting all my little children out there.  But, I am quite tired now.  Peace.  Love.  Eat Moe's Tacos!

      Wow, critique=not happening.  I am so sick of school.  It needs to die.  None of this "oh but it's almost vacation crap."  No, I have so much freaking vacation homework already, it's so dumb.    13 page reading+ response essay =ewwww  Start travel project (Venice here I come) except not really.  I wish from doing these projects we could free tickets to these places.  Yeah right.  How could I forget.  We go to Wachusett.  Umm yes long long times a million Bio paper due May 3rd.  The Juniors' papers were due today and some people had to stay up until 3 in the morning doing them, lovely.    Yes, English research presentation on the Boston Police Strike in 1919. Fun.  Plus, rewrite for after vacation.    Oh man, this will be a fun time.   Yuck.  Except definitely need bargain shopping day with Jacqui.  It shall be a par-tay.  Also, I love my cool sorority sisters b/c they leave me wicked cool comments such as "horay" and "poop on me".    Word up, homeboys (or girls really).

      I got my permit today.  Too much waiting with sketchy people.  But whatever.  Test=easy.  And considering the fact that i don't do drugs or drink, most of it didn't actually pertain to me.   My mother gave me a lesson in driving.  The very first thing I did was basically drive up the hill on the side of the driveway.  Oops.  But, then we went around the block, and I was ok.  But I hated it.  So much.  I'll get better though, it was the first time.    Now, Princess Diaries.

       More Than Just OK  I'm listening to Switchfoot.  Meliss would be proud.  I spent at least 5 minutes today trying to open a jar of peanut butter.  It was tough work.  Not something to be proud of.    I have to write an ode for English.  Don't know what topic yet.  Suggestions?  Easy history test today.  Nice. B+ Winter's Tale Soundtrack.  Not too bad.  Rewrite?  Uhh probably not.   Gym first... lots of obscure running exercises.  It was pretty fun though, I'd say.  Apparently my art teacher sent my Hawaiian flower collage to some art show. At Mt. Wachusett or something.  That's what she said.   Exciting, even though she just told me today.    I've been doing some heavy reading from the driver's book since hopefully I shall get my permit this week.  Friday, maybe, if they're open.    I hope so badly that my mini ipod comes in soon.  Please Please Please.    Grades close Thursday... Bio isn't looking hopeful.  Please please 90.  English i think I have an A-... Actually so excited about that one.  I'm really sick of myself as I am.  I need to change.

      Wow, long time no write.  Wow, corniness.  Ok, so stop saying wow.  Yes, tomorrow=MCAS, joy of my life.  I'm sure I shall get "needs improvement" on the English section as I always seem to get.  Lucky lucky me.  So, I believe there are 23(?) days of school left.  Thank goodness.  Today=softball practice that I didn't even know about until now.  Joy also.    This weekend was Maine.  Good beaching on Saturday, but other than that it was fairly boring.  Wow my life is boring.  The other day i decided that there were some girls who I really want to become better friends with.  I'll give it a shot.  Haha, I saw something funny today.  Must tell Meliss because it directly concerns her.    I have come to the realization that I want a boyfriend so badly.  I don't feel as antisocial as I seem, I don't think.   I want someone to come with me to Maine over Memorial Day weekend.  Any takers? Because if you are free that weekend it should be a par-tay.    That is all.  Ciao.  Au revoir.  Adios.  Love from  the  coolest.

       Skip this, it is just me venting   So, none of my shorts really fit.  This is both embarrassing and disheartening.  I am not one of those girls who does not have major self confidence issues and but still says "I'm fat" all the time.  Because I  do  have self confidence issues, but  don't  say "I'm fat" all the time.  But it is how I feel.  And I know it's true, hence the whole shorts comment.  I'm trying to fix this whole situation, it's not working so well.    I think the worst part is that I know what it feels like to not feel so fat and to have self confidence  Because I did, once.  For about a month.  Or a day.

      So when I was walking  up the hill today after school I was thinking about what I wanted to write in here because I really wanted to write something.  It was going to be about how I'm not happy.  And bitter.  But now I don't really feel that.  I mean, I know it's there, but it's just not what I'm feeling right now, which is really good because I do not like being unhappy even though I have been a lot lately.    So, the reason why I changed my mind was just two simple things, but that make me really happy.    1.  My game tomorrow night has been canceled.  This means I get to go to the play, hopefully with Meliss/Carolina.  I was looking at the pictures in the Landmark and realized how much I wanted to see the play, but didn't think i could and now I can.  Woot!  (Note to self: stop saying woot)  2.  More importantly, let me quote:  The following items were included in this shipment: --------------------------------------------------------------------- Qty      Item                           Price  Shipped  Subtotal --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1        Apple 4 GB iPod Mini Green M94 $249.00  1      $249.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Aka my ipod has finally been shipped!  Yes yes yes so so excited about that!  So, that makes my day that much brighter.

      Go crest white strips... I am a fan except it is only my 4th day but w/e.  I am cleansing myself.  It is like spring cleaning for the body.  And because I've gotten really fat lately.  Woot, go me.  I want to go shopping so badly, but i don't have anytime.   I guess it'll have to wait awhile, until like June, sadly.      I want to see Hello Dolly, but I can't.  Stupid busy-ness.  I got a C- on my critique, go me.  Rewrite=tomorrow.    I need to write a poem for English, I have no idea what it'll be about, though.  Actually wait, I lied, it has to be about dreams.  Ugh.   Plus a huge English quiz/test tomorrow that i will probably do so bad on.  I hate English, it is far too hard.  I just don't get it at all.    Projects suck.  And I never use the word suck.

      I need to stop wasting so much time.  i know I'm going to regret it when I actually figure out what I wish I was doing instead.  If I put all the time I waste going online and watching random TV shows, I would have so much time for other things.  Except I'm typing in this, which must be a waste of time too I guess.  Hopefully I'll use the next 4 1/2 hours very efficiently and get a lot of my bio project done.  Hopefully.  Yahoo was fun with the whole little sorority.  Too many bugs, but a lot of talking about Meliss-knows-who.    Oh god i just clicked on my little aim icon without even thinking about it.  I guess wasting time is what I do best.  Ok then wasted time going on a website.  This is bad.    My next worthwhile waste of time will be seeing Seth/Adam Brody get punked in a couple minutes.  Oh wow I am such a hypocrite.

I was reading old posts that I had written & I realized how much more effort I put into them.  They were actually enjoyable.  Now it's like whatever, blah, blah, says something random, talks some more, hopes for a comment, comes online and looks but nobody has actually commented.  OK, I'm going to continue to lead my boring existence and read my book some more.  If anybody has any suggestions as to something productive I could do, tell me, maintenant.

      Umm yes, so if you were super cool like me and decided to sign up for AP US History, you've probably noticed the millions of pages that we have to read and write over the summer.  OK, and it suggests getting together with people to do it.  Like I would do it myself.  NO.  So I'll have to find some cool kids to do all the work with me, blah.  Today was my last lunch ever with Miss Carolina.  Ever.  It consisted of a lot of ketchup discussion mostly.  And why did we have Bio long block on the last long block ever this year.  Bad, bad, bad.    I got my award in History.  I was most consistent and favorite book choice for my complete distaste of my book review book.  Lovely.

      My life is insanely boring.  Nobody in their right mind would want to live it.  That's all I have to say about that, but, trust me, it's totally true.  I had my last French class in room 9 ever today.  It made me really sad, there has been a lot of good times there.  OK, so far my math class is me, Jenna, Lauren, Travis, Paige and that's about all I can think of.  We best get there early on the first day of school because I am not sitting next to Greg.  Oh yeah, Greg is in our class.  Quelle Joie.

      Yesterday, Miss Carolina and I had the scare of our life when we saw Mr. Bernard at the movies.  In all of our smoothness, it was mighty scary.    Harry Potter= super cool.  But that's mighty obvious.    Yesterday i did some power shopping.  In only 20 minutes I finished Sar's birthday present.  I hope she likes it.  I think she will.

Much love to the Parkerites   In other news, Hailbop/Ferret won the sunglasses, Brittles attempted to slide but instead did some slightly painful jumping into my arms, Jolly Ranchers now come in blue raspberry, and Emily Chase came to visit us.  She looks amazingly like other Hailey.  It is the smile I think.  And we won.  <3 to the law enforcement.

      You know what I thought about today that I thought would be such a cool experience?  To have an exchange student live with me or someone I knew.  I think that would be the coolest and most rewarding thing.  Except my family doesn't exactly get along well enough to do that...  But I still think it would be awesome.

In a massive lightining storm.  there was so much rain, we could barely see coming home, and lightning surrounded us and it is still flashing, but i still came home and turned on my sure-to-be lightning rod.  Brilliant, brilliant me.

And my back is peeling from my really awful zebra stripe sunburn. Wonderful.  Yes!! Chinese food a.s.a.p.  We hear about the results for the elections tomorrow.  Wish me luck!  P.S.

      Last night I had a dream that Kotoski moved in next door to me because the house just got sold next door and my mom and I went to meet the new neighbors and it was her, but for some reason we were in her bedroom and she started talking to us.  So, I ran down to the front door and tried to leave the house and run home but the door was stuck and it wouldn't open.  So I kept trying but my arm got all crampy and didn't have energy to open the door.  So then it got really cold and I had to take one of her awful awful sweaters from the hall closet and put it one.It was an actual one she wears that is orange and blue and every color. So then I finally got the door open and ran home exhausted and I took the sweater off in my laundry room in the cellar and put it on the dryer and I noticed that she had never taken the price tag off and it said SALE $49.99 from Marshalls and then I woke up.  It was the scariest and most vivid dream I've had in a very long time.  I remember the whole time being scared that she would see me.

      I need a life.  I need interests.  I need activities.  I need to not need sleep.  I will never get into college.  I will waste my life away.  I will regret every moment I wasted as a teenager.  Yet I do it anyway.  I need a job.  I need more friends.  I need to take on more responsibilities.  I need to not be so lazy.  I need to enjoy my youth.  I need to be involved.  I need to stop ranting and actually get out and do something.

      Switchfoot to the extrema. It's quite depressing all this you're not as good as you could be stuff.  But it is true.  Or quoting Ms. Beckwith might be the depressing part.  Maine.  Lovely/slightly boring.  No friends.  A slight tan.  More freckles.  Back sunburn, one stripe.  Too many s'mores.  I guess that's why they call them s'mores.    I need to develop interests.  I have none.  And everything bores me.  But funny how being bored doesn't seem to bore me considering I am bored very very often.    Harry Potter 3=tres soon.  Going to see it with Miss Carolina in our holy nerdiness a.s.a.p.  And Maybe Meliss too, if she wants.  I shall see, we must hold up our Harry Potter tradition.  And don't go questioning our extreme coolness.    I want Nikki's purse soooo badly.

Say it to me face!"&nbsp; and lots of of "Alright, bitch" And "F You's" but that F is extended, of course.&nbsp; And then there's Barbara, and she just sits there with her ugly pink stripe shirt and her too tight skirt day after day and waves her fists around and thinks that she is mad.&nbsp; It is sooo comical.&nbsp; Tomorrow, Sar and I may start to sway and sing "Why Can't We Be Friends, Why Can't We Be Friends" and let the wonderful-ish glow of her cel phone take over.&nbsp; YES.&nbsp; Oh how I own't miss you my, Driver's Ed buddies.

      I had a super uber fabity fab fabosity time in Maine yesterday.  I actually have a respectable tan (for me) but I'm going to have such a bad halter top tan because my 2 favorite bathing suits are both halter tops.  Oh well, it doesn't bother me too much.  We had chicken fingers and carrot cake on the beach too.  Yummmmm.    Today, I've mostly been hanging around but I've actually been really busy. I had to fix my itunes. but now I have about 420 songs on my ipod so that is super fab.  I really want to go CD shopping and get some Counting Crows, O.A.R., and Guster.  I am officially a legal person- no more illegal downlaoding for me.  But I've never illegally downloaded, only thought about it.  Riiiiight.  I will only use iTunes.  Hopefully.  I need to call those cool friends of mine.  I haven't seen them in a while.

      "My trip to Mexico was really good except I got some sort of allergic reaction to mosquitoes so I had these HUGE red bumps everywhere on my arms and legs.  I think I looked like I had chicken pox.  I must have looked really  sexy  because I quit shaving because there were just too many bumps."   In other news, the cape was fun.  The baseball games were very  appealing .  California here I come to hang out w/ my baseball boys.  I actually really did like the baseball itself aussi, but what can I say?  I love those boys.  So, I just got back but now we are going to the beach in Maine tomorrow.  Then I will be back for a long while.  If anybody wants to get together this week, tell me, s.v.p.

      How lovely.  Yes so Cape Cod has not been at all as exciting as usual what with the lack of my favorite cousin and all.  But she will be here tomorrow.  Excellent.  So, here comes a list.  The things I've done so far this weekend at the Cape house: -painted my toenails -worn my new Gap flipflop -gone for long and short bikerides -not seen Ashley (thank god) -watched Ferris Bueller on I Love 86 -driven for the first time in 2 months,I still haven't actually made it to the road -at this rate I will get my license when I am 247834 years old -eaten 2 too many s'mores -taken an annual trip to the Christmas tree shop -recharged  my iPod twice -taken 2 naps -watched  funny dancing roller blade aerobics man -saw some really really large breasted woman with a really really unsupportive tanktop type bra on who was walking really really fast: get the picture? -and, most importantly, I've become best friends with my iPod because I have been quite BORED.  Save me.  Please.  This is not a cry of distress.  When my cool cousin arrives tomorrow it will ALL change.  Believe me.   Ta ta & Goodnight.  My iPod would like to chat now.  Sleepover!

      Woah I just saw a squirrel completely fall out of a tree and it totally distracted me.  Lovely.  Anyways, I totally didn't sleep well last night from that HUGE lightning storm around 3? in the morning.  I'm almost done packing for the Cape.  I am so so excited.  It is always such a par-tay!  If I feel like it I may make an ode to our experience like I did last year.  Ode to Ashley?  Maybe.

       That is true.      Alright-tay. I am back from Maine where we (me/the spotted lobster) had a lovely lovely time doing things that eventually led to us getting sunburnt. Woot. And I learned that I have said detangler wrong all my life (detanguler). Wow am I cool. So, I am home for the next 2 or maybe 3 days and then it's off to Maine, again. I really need to work on my summer history work. Really badly.       I went to the library today and got some super books. Yeah. But I was also really stupid and I forgot to pick up an application to be a library page there this winter. It'll probably be really boring, but money is money and it shouldn't take up that much of my time, so I'll do it.       I   haven't seen Miss Xarolyn in so long, it saddens me.    Nothing more to say. Later kids.      I really want a watch. A pretty one.
