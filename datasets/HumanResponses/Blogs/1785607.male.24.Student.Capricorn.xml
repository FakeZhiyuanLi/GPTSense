      OK... went out yesterday to celebrate the end of the first week of school... a group of friends and I went out and grabbed a bite... finally we went to this place to have some "drinks" and some wanted to dance...  As night passed I realized that I'm in this place alone, though all my friends were alone and that I was getting attention  (in the total sweet and innocent sense of the word)  from a girl-friend. It just seems that when I'm in a group the sense of loneliness gets so much hard to endure. That and my big secrets!  So it all comes to the moment that I just can't handle all this pressure... I'll explode but it scares me... the reaction, the sense of lost that I'll be having  (because it will happen)   I just wish it all could be a little easier and have a friend approaching me and telling me: "I know" ... It'll lift all the woes and worries... and I could be a lot free... 'cause as I once heard:  "the soul suffers"  .... You have no idea how that is true...!!!

      Feel so blue again... Well, for what is worth, I went out yesterday, but just realized how lonely I am...     The lamp is burnin' low upon my table top The snow is softly fallin' The air is still within the silence of my room I hear your voice softly callin'  If I could only have you near To breathe a sigh or two I would be happy just to hold the hands I love Upon this winter night with you  The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead My glass is almost empty I read again between the lines upon the page The words of love you sent me  If I could know within my heart That you were lonely too I would be happy just to hold the hands I love Upon this winter night with you  The fire is dying now, my lamp is growing dim The shades of night are liftin' The mornin' light steals across my windowpane Where webs of snow are driftin' if I could only have you near To breathe a sigh or two I would be happy just to hold the hands I love And to be once again with with you To be once again with with you.    Song for a Winter's Night.     Sarah McLachlan

      Now I'm so tired.. but tired good..!!! ... Back at school and having no time to even sit... and again lovin' it  But why you'd ask... well... is so simple it's stupid:  "Hate to have all that free time to think in what could have and didn't"  ... and that's what I love about being so damn busy with school...   Last wensday was my mum's birthday... I didn't buy her anything, have the money though... but don't get mad at me, she knows I have the money for her present and that I'll take her later next week to spend it... we both are busy.. so...

      Ok, am I a drama queen? .... so it seems to be. I am so lame when sad. Anyway...  Is kinda funny how sad can a memory make you. Now that I see it, with kinda of a cold head, Is totally true that when a relation ends, one needs to mourn it, to cry it, to be sad about it. Is so much part of the healing process... too bad if you are like me and are still in LOVE...   One of the elements that masked all my pain was that I was really busy with class and family... now that I'm on vacations (which BTW are one day to be over) and saw the cause of my sorrow... I just broke...   It was a hell of a moment. This person looked really good, not much of a change though. But felt more confident, really grown up. I fell again! How can you not? The sense of selfsufficient this person projected, but all around sweet and in need of someone... do you know what I mean? ....

      I just got it...   Last night I was in bed thinking and thinking and thinking... and it popped, this comfort zone I've been livin' in is just too comfortable. It has nothing to do to try to avoid drama, it has nothing to do with me trying to live stress free. It has everything to do with the fact that I'm still in love... and now that I see this, I know, though that I made the right decision, I can't move on... This feeling is strong and is still in me... We are not friends anymore, we became distant, even though a relation is there.   Now I think in my later relations, and it comes to mind, did I sabotage those? I know I did what I had to do, they wanted a strong and lasting relationship, but I just wasn't ready, in fact, I didn't care for one of those... Love those persons to death, and they are still my friends... but they were just not what I wanted or needed.   So, is this normal? it's been a long time since we broke... Maybe is that I didn't let myself down, and I did need those days to break my heart out... last night I did it and it felt great... though now I feel so blue, that I just want to hang in my room listening to everything Sarah McLachlan can offer me. Just so you know, and I think you'll read this one day:   I still Love you, and I know you have moved on, still, just wanted you to know that I'll be alright.     It was such a nice and lovable relation. We needed each other, we complemented each other... now is just me! And that makes my heart ache. It is impossible to be together again? Yes, is not as if we wanted to be together again we could, no, is the fact that we don't belong together.  Man I'm feelin' blue!    I just feel in the same place, I feel static, everything's the same. I need new an exciting elements in my life, something that can make me forget about everything that makes me sad...       Autumn is here inside my heart  When there's springtime in the air  Loneliness is tearing me apart  Being lost makes me scared   I keep on asking the gods above  To send my love back to me  Oh please let these days and weeks  Pass by so quickly   Nobody suffers like I do  Nobody else, oh no  Nobody suffers like I do  Nobody else but you   You had to leave, I know  And we knew it would be tough  You said you would be back soon  Soon is not soon enough   I keep on asking the gods above  To send my love back to me  Oh please let these days and weeks  Pass by so quickly   Nobody suffers like I do  Nobody else, oh no  Nobody suffers like I do  Nobody else but you   Through this waiting in vain  All this darkness and pain  I've been crying for you, now I'm dying  When this test is at end  I hope you'll understand  That you're all that I've got  Oh darling   Nobody suffers   Autumn is here inside my heart  When there's springtime in the air   Nobody suffers like I do  Nobody else, oh no  Nobody suffers like I do  Nobody else but you     Suffering.   Jay Jay Johanson .

       Just for you to know.... got in touch with this thing "the blog" a few days ago, but never paid much attention to it, so now, that I've been reading about it, is such an easy way of keeping a journal, far from the way I was doing it... so as I'm not in the mood of dealing with dates and stuff... I'll just post the older ones today as a bunch.....by the way,  urlLink my webpage  (which don't allow FTP as I don't want to pay a bunch of cash monthly... shame on them, shame on them!!!)       urlLink    ...&nbsp; urlLink         July 29 - 2003  Had to start one day, haven't I....?  Well, I'll try not to bore. Yesterday went to the movies and saw "28 days later" for a second time... but still good... Bad company though, I mean I love those girls with all my heart, but they got all the gore and not the story.... shame on them... shame on them...  Ok, about the movie... Is good, people... but hope that u see it with an open mind. Try to put yourself in his shoes.  Yesterday was a good day, I mean, met a bunch of new people, cool people, and hanged with my usual friends... even though the day was hot and humid, and I hate that.     July 30 - 2003  How difficult it is to get into a relationship. I don't want to be the first in someone's life, in fact, I'm trying not to be. It's a cliche? Yes, but it is also a valid one. Don't want to get all my hopes up and then get blown away because what it was going to happen happened.   But man, it sure gets lonely with rules over time. Anyway, I am making friends in the process at least. And for those who care, IT IS NOT ABOUT AGE, or experience... It is just common sense.  In other issues, school is near, again. this time it seems that I'll be more (if that's possible) busy.... Long schedule...  Maybe if I were a little bolder I could get over all this dating scene and grab someone that matters, but I don't want to be, I am happy the way I am. I just hope to meet someone that could share the same interests that I have. But here's the catch, I don't want a serious relation, 'cause I know (and I have) it won't be my priority (sad but true), I want something lighter, I mean, I don't go sleeping around and I am not promiscuous (BELIEVE ME) just don't want to get tangled in all this time-priority-leave classes to be with me-meet with me every night 'till long hours of the night kind of relation, but I want more than a friend... Do I make sense?      August 07 - 2003  Been working on new drawings, and trying to learn Macromedia's Studio MX.  What is it with sex, or with me for that matter? ... I don't seem very interested in it. Lately, I realized, I've been living a sexless life, the odd thing is that it has been for a long time, but just in the past months have I come to the conclusion that I just don't miss it. And for the record, is not that I don't have someone to do it, is just that I don't want to do it. There are days that I seem more in tune with my sexual needs, but it is never a craving or a NEED, just the hotness of the moment.  Am I worried? Hell yeah!!! Is not a feeling that I want. I'm a firming believer that a relationship is not just about companionship and friendship but also sex, 'cause if what you want is just the first two, then get a dog ( luckily I have 4!!! ) and I do want a relationship. I have tried to cure myself, Playboy channel is my witness, but nothing, is just not there.   Been told is just a phase, it'll wear off.   In other matters, I've been getting tired of all this design, that's why I'm trying to learn everything macromedia... but is just so much work.... and I don't like reading tutorial or whatever the name of the PDF files the program has..... is bad for my tush and my back, oh and also for my eyes. ALL IN THE NAME OF ART...!!!     August 09 - 2003  What's the deal with everyone's life, I mean, drama here, drama there... and my life seems just drama-free. All this 'cause I've been browsing the web and found this place (well not much of finding, I was sent a link by a friend) where people has a blog and just such a drama everywhere. All my friends are in the same page, specially women. When will they understand that as far as the relationships they have those equal drama.  Maybe I'm just too methodical or boring or whatever, but I do live a happy life at the moment... stress free... but I do need money though...  oops!!! There's my drama!!!     August 12 - 2003  I've been fighting with the idea of a journal or diary, binnacle, whatever you wanna call it... Most of the ones I've read are focused on everyday minutiae. Till I found this one called  urlLink justins' life , about a gay guy in, I think San Diego, and even though he deals in his diary with everyday events, he pours everything in it, all his mind, his feelings, etcetera, a little whinny but it is a cool way of doing it....   urlLink

      At almost one week of being a "couple", Sunday night swept away my fears on this relationship. To this point all has being nice and polite, we haven't had a fight ( event thought seeing our temper, Rome could burn again ). What I was afraid of, and most of you could sense it in my previous posts, was the sense of, maybe, not having much in common in which to base this relation. I mean, being Gay is nice, but is not all.  I know that I love him, and is the second time I felt this strong about someone. But now, I know that we can spend time alone being us, without boring each other to death... He   is   what I need.   ... What's the matter with my classmates and me? We seem to just not care about school anymore. Well, maybe not school, just some classes... They are boring, senseless, long, tedious and useless. Most of us just wait for class to end to leave and grab a bite. This is not our usual behavior, so, what the fuck is going on? It is us, or it is the subject? I'm in love, so I don't care. I just have to say something different so no one can tell me that I'm a little bit obsessed, ah, screw you if you feel that way. I am obsessed, so what?... ( sorry for the "screw you" part, hang in there my friends )

      Everyone should be so lucky to find someone like my baby. He's perfect.  Even though he kinda deceive me with his name... Whatever... He's the best. Yesterday, we spent the afternoon and night together... We were at El Centro and we just went from one place to another one without a schedule. I felt great, we were relaxed, talking, been us. Now, as I said before: in the matters of two, I could only speak for myself, so. It was great for me. There was no pressure to do something, there was no need to fulfill time. At one point, we were going to the movies and they were too late so we sat in the parking lot talking... It was a nice way of spending a Sunday afternoon with someone you care.  I spent the night with him at his place of work. And I thought, maybe, we could get bored there, just staring at each other. Au Contraire. We had a nice chat... He was tired, I wasn't that much... Still, was a great night. A great conversation. And I found myself feeling a little chicken when it came to say what I felt... I'm more of a writer. SO I'LL SAY IT AGAIN, FOR YOU TO READ: I LOVE YOU. Did you see how more relaxed I was being friendly in public?... I just didn't care what everyone thought, I did care of a nice beating, but heck, what is one to do in those cases?

      I have been reading some blogs lately, and I'm getting the idea that when a Blog tends toward the relationship area, it doesn't matter str8, gay or even bi, it's all about drama, like all relationships are. Reading mine, I see that I'm not different than the rest. Yes, I tend to put something different now and then, but as a rule, when I didn't have a relationship I was complaining about the ones my friends had or the one I didn't have and just growing bitter remembering the one that matter to me. In the inter between meeting my guy and having the real and actual relationship, I just have the tendency to be scared, emotional, sometimes frustrated and insecure... Now, that I have one, is all the same, plus jealousy.  Sometimes, reading and remembering what I felt at the moment of the post, I feel like the third world answer to Carrie Bradshaw... Too bad that my not-column doesn't have all those readers... I could be a hit. LOL!    ... It was cathartic ( just hope this is the way the word is written ). Thinking it, writing it, reading it and saying it. I am a jealous person. What am I jealous of? I don't know, I just am. Believe me though, when I said and wrote that word yesterday, a BIG weight was lifted of my chest. I feel so good now. So in peace. So secure. I can move on now, and grow on what I want this to be.   ... See, I tend to make everything about me and my drama...!!! Fuck why not? Is my blog... If I want to read about someone else's drama I'd read another blog...

      I've been asked a lot of questions lately... and I got to think about them so frequently that they make me feel numb, anxious, and weird all together.  I know I started this blog in a totally different direction that the one is taking... I tried at the beginning just to explain my life, to explain the way I think and now I got caught in the natural dramedy of a relationship. For example, today, I'm here, at home, alone, aching for him... but when we are together, I just think how good I feel, but how awkward it is for me to be with a guy... specially when it comes to think in my family and friends...  I've lied, to friends and family... this closet case is not a nice thing to live.. but I am so afraid though... I thought that I was ok with my situation ( all before I met him ) but is not nice at all to do stuff and hide it all from the ones you care, specially when is something that makes you feel alive again with someone you start to love...   I'm proud of what I am. If someone asks me I'd tell. Is not like I am this big mystery, now, the problem for me is that I've built this friendships on the basis of, well, not  a lie, but a secret... and that's what scares me. What would they feel for me now if they known the truth about me.  Well, he is not here. I'm here alone; with all this thoughts and not knowing what to do... I even feel lonely. All of a sudden I blocked myself from everyone else that is not him... and I don't want to do that... Today he told me that he would be gone till tomorrow, anyway, I didn't make plans in hope that maybe ( and I knew it was a long shoot ) he would come today... I'm not blaming him for me being alone today, he told me about this trip a week ago, still, I want to be able to hang with him, and at the same time being free to feel secure enough of hanging with everyone else that matters to me and they knowing him, and accepting him for what he represents in my life now... But, another question: what does he represents in my life? A partner? A friend? Maybe is too soon to know, and maybe I'm just too worried about it, and maybe I shouldn't be writing about this at all, I could even scare him... Am I making too much of a deal ? aaaaggghhh... !!!! This is so hard.. If it were just me, that way I'd knew what's going on.. but in the matters of two, I could only know half of what's going on...  See how I go from being ready to come out to some friends to, where does my relationship goes...! I worry to much... Thank God we haven't had sex, I could be dying of jealousy by now. That's it...!!! I am jealous... could it be? So soon? ... Fuck, I'm a freak... that's what's been bothering me... I am jealous... fuck, fuck, fuck... damn it... I hate myself...   Well, as I know you'll read this latter in the week..   SORRY...!!! just bear with me and don't freak out...! I told you, it's been a long time since I got a real relationship... Now that I have said it, I feel better.. yes I am jealous.. and it doesn't feel good, but now, I feel free, it's not making me feel blue anymore...! So dude, Love you... And I'll see you, when I see you...!!! Kisses...

      Ok, picture this:  Mexicali, 2003, at night, three guys, a bar (gay btw)...   Oh my God! It was my first time in one of those... let me tell you: tacky, tacky, tacky... I went because I'm a good sport and I didn't want my bf and his friend to get bored with me...  So we entered, and in the stage ( if we can call that a stage ) was a guy, totally high, dancing, alone. There were cute guys there and some lesbos, thank God I was there with my baby or I would've run out of there... I was numb... never have I ever seen such group of feminine guys. Anyway, the music was kinda nice. Now I think that I might ( well, I NEED ) to get loose a little and start dancing, 'cause as I saw, "A" likes to dance.  Now on the "A" subject. I been thinking, and I sense we need to do something fun and not only the movie-dinner-kiss date, we need to make some memories of our own, I know I sound kinda extreme here, specially since we've known each other for almost three weeks and been on the bf phase for just a couple of days... but the thing here is that I love him, and I think that if we do not do something, this could get boring and not exciting at all, it's all fine by me, I'm happy just at the thought of lying there in a room, reading a book next to him, or just watching him watch TV... that's how much I love him. But he seems kind of the party guy... and that, more of an option, is a lifestyle...  now, one of the things I hate about our situation is that there's nothing to do either here in Mexicali or Calexico... so, what should I do? To get matters a little bit more complicated, he works all night as I go to school, we have mornings free, but he's tired, so do I, and if we DO go out in the morning there's nothing to do... mmmhh... I'm in a pickle... and today he's not around.   School subject.  OK, after a terrible week at school, in which I failed two tests, didn't pay attention, got a new teacher, and never did my homework, I got a little exciment in the shape of weekend... hahahaha! Ok, tests, the first one was History... Man! it was nothing good at all.. I knew all the subjects, but the test had tricky questions, and that's not nice at all. Now, the teacher did again the test because we all asked for it, but she got us again, asking obscure facts that had nothing to do with the material ( ok, the info was there in the material she handed out to us, but they weren't episodes of history, they were names that were just stupid to ask for )... so I flunked both times the same subject... So that pretty much sums the past week... it was hell...   I wanna see my baby...!!! ( I need to get him a nickname )

      It seems that I am getting into a real relationship ( at least it does looks like that ) and if you've been following this blog, you'll know that I have said and I have mentioned not so long ago about my sexless life... and if you paid attention you'll remember what I think about relationships and sex, they are one.  Now, I'm getting into the first half of a whole, and I don't seem at all prepared to fulfill the second half any time near... Is not that I don't have those feelings for this guy, au contraire... But it has passed a long time... LONG, LONG, LONG time since the last time... I even feel as a virgin... LOL, yeah right!  Still... today has a nice feeling... I may get into something I thought I didn't want and was avoiding... we'll see what happens...   Two weeks, well one week. That's what it took for me to fall in love...!!! I'm so easy...!!! Hahahahaha..!!!!     Now, movie topic...   Underworld.  First, let's see what kind of movie person are you. Do you like action or drama? Do you like monsters or dreamy guys and leading ladies? Do you liked or hated the matrix?...  Well, non of the above matters... Underworld is a nice mix of story, monsters, outfits and special effects that do not made the movie, they enhanced it... It is true, the movie gets a little too slow after a great start, but is still bearable... now for the story, is actually good for what it is, don't know why, don't know how, however they managed to scrounge a love plot between Kate and the guy from Felicity... still it doesn't hurt that much to the story, aside that you don't care if he gets killed or they end up together... Now, at the end part or twist or plot of the story you get to see Kate in a great leathery outfit that if I were str8 I'd go for it even though she's SO out of my league. Just check the nice effect when she jumps with a sword from one side of the camera to the other side all in the middle of a pond or whatever its called... just a plain and good popcorn movie to leave problems out the theater... Now, the style is so good. Gothic decadent and rich in blacks, whites and reds... is a cool flick.    urlLink    Sony Pictures at IGN&nbsp; urlLink

      This is how I feel... This is how I feel, now. This is from my heart... Corny? Yeah! But that's me...!  Today I'm in such a good mood, and I just don't know why... Well, I do, but I think I need to keep some secrets of my life as what they are: personal.    And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true I needed you and you were there And I'll never leave, why should I leave? I'd be a fool 'cause I finally found someone who really cares  You held my hand when it was cold When I was lost you took me home You gave me hope when I was at the end And turned my lies back into truth again You even called me "friend"    You needed me. Anne Murray     In other matters, what a freaky day's today... Is kinda windy and there's a soft sheet of clouds in the sky that don't leave space for the sun to come through... This hurricane or tropical storm ( whatever the hell it could be... See how I'm not in touch with the real world when I'm in love ) is supposed to hit us here tomorrow Wednesday at night... Wind and rain is in store for us... We'll see what happens.

      A few hours ago I was talking, well, messaging with a friend and we were getting acquainted on how our lives have been in the past weeks... I of course being the drama queen that I am spilled all I had inside. He made such valid points of view, all of them true... Man, how good is talking with someone that brings a cold head.  Maybe the thing that he said and that stuck with me was: "...then what you are not used to is to feel for someone this way, or is that it has passed a long time for you to have someone to care for... that is confusing you. What you need to do is to take it easy."  What an eye opener... I should get more in touch with those who understand me...!

      Almost two years ago I was with a friend (Becky) and we were going to spend the day at the movies and shopping... We were in my car and we turned the radio on, they were playing Jewel's Standing Still...  I was a little down at the moment and it did hit hard... I was thinking of my previous relations and it just fit... So I said to Becky: "it must be a little too hard to live asking that, isn't it?" .... She said something so true, and yet it made me feel more sad than I was, she said: "in a relationship, there's always one that needs the most" ...   So who am I, the one who needs the most...?  Let's say, I've been thinking about this episode a lot since Thursday... and I've been down.. down.. down... so blue.. I just don't know why... yesterday I was all afternoon in my room, laying on bed, thinking, and thinking, and thinking... I cannot do my homework anymore... I just seem unable to concentrate...  Later at night I was on the net, msn with my very special friend, and at the beginning I was just giving him the cold shoulder and that's so not who I am... I kinda got in the mood more into the night.. but still... maybe is just that I am just a drama queen... now I see why I try not to get my emotional defenses down... I get sad so easily...  Now if u read this later, and I don't get the chance to talk to you in person about this, then here it goes:  I'm sorry if I seem pushy regarding the relationship stuff, I think now that two years in the single mode took its toll. Also, sorry if I seem so anal on the net, u are working and want to have a nice time... and I'm just too serious. I'll try to be more easy going... All this because I don't want to jeopardize something that could be SO good ... And as I once put it on my msn screen:    For of all sad words of tongue or pen,  the saddest are these, "It might have been!"    John Greenleaf Whittier    And believe you me.... Is not the first time this words would have haunted me... hope this time they won't...

      At least not at the moment...  This guy is just what I needed... the hard part here is that I don't know what the hell am I feeling... nor do I know what do I want ...  I find myself thinking of him all day, every hour... he's kind and nice... but he seems to have a more resolved life than the one I have. He seems more mature, more in tune with what he wants... I'm just a mess... also.. I don't want to get a broken heart..  Today I was at school... just me and a friend in the class... so we had the total attention of the teacher... All I could think about was him:  did he towed his car?...  maybe is asleep...  should I call when I get home?...  will he call me later in the day?... could I see him today even though he works tonight?... did he had a good time during our date yesterday?... am I a prospect or just a little bit more than a friend?... love or lust?... I like him... he is nice and sweet... he's dreamy... why is the teacher looking at me?... did she asked me something?... I think she did... what do I do?... what will he be doing today?... oh yeah, the teacher... mmmhhh.... should I ask for her to repeat the question?... he must be asleep... it was a weird conversation last nite... it is normal for me to feel this way after just two weeks of knowing him?... did she repeat the question?... I want to go to the bathroom... I want to see him in his uniform... I'll let him call first today... hope I'll be alone at home today to call him and spent a lot of time on the phone... man, she did repeat the question... I wanna go piss!... he's funny... he did spent a lot of money on me yesterday... I should have had some dollars... I looked cheap... he's so giving... I'm bursting...  I need to go to the bathroom... she's still looking, now what for?... Are we in the same question?... Man.. Yeah, he must be asleep...   and so and so... that's how I've been spending this last days since tuesday... oh and for those who care... a great kisser with a lot of feeling... two thumbs up...!!!

       I wrote this on September 15, but I just didn't want to look like an ass writing it and then writing another thing 'cause it didn't work... but as things go... they look just cool and promising...   ........................   I have a crush... it was first by net, then phone... now I've seen the guy and he's dreamy...!  At first he was kinda of annoying, he expected me to respond his questions or comments over the net right away. With time I grow to tolerate it, and also to get to know a really cool guy.  Suddendly he became eager... he wanted my number, my phone number. I refused at first ... then I remembered what I have wrote on this blog days before about being to self conscious and a little too chicken to make contact, personal contact, so I gave in... but before, we made an appointment to meet and get to know each other. He had already seen my pics and had a good share of msn with cam (by my side) but I just haven't by that time seen any of him.  So I got there, spent a few hours, oh I'm kidding, just an hour and he never showed up. I got the sense that maybe he saw me ( at least he knew who I was ) and then left with out saying a word. Later that day (like and hour later) he got online and asked for my number... and as I said, I gave in and let him call me...  And so he did. He had a voice !!!!!  Oh what a voice...!!! We spoke on the phone for a good hour, maybe more. He still wanted for me to meet him somewhere, I wasn't going to, after he blowing me off earlier... aside, he said he was going to Yuma or something like it.... He explained why he didn't show up ... and it was ok by me... he made a good point ( meaning that I have been victim of it several times ...  ).  He called the next day (9/15/03) and asked me for a date... again...!!! This time at night, he said he would call first, 'cause I said: "maybe I would, maybe I won't" He did call, but this time with an offer: "Can I meet with you tomorrow afternoon?" I said yes, gave him my address ( wow... have I changed or what? snap snap ). He told me he would pass by my house that night to just know for sure where I lived (uh huh!) ... Later, not even an hour I think, I heard a "ding dong"... I kinda looked through the window and saw him, and thought "maybe is him"  ... then I thought "sure thing is my brother's friend".... So I opened the door and he asked for my brother... I was so disappointed and said "NO" and almost close the door... what a shame and a waste, he was cute... He started laughing and told me his name.... HE, was HIM.  Man, it all fit: voice, looks, attitude, fashion sense ;) ... and I was there, with my geeks look with a dorky look... and I thought ".. mmm...  this guy looks loaded"  hahahaha j/k!!!  Still, I'm meeting him tomorrow, just hope this time I'm not the one pushing aside.. 'cause so far I dig what I saw...!!! I'll keep u posted...

      Man... did I wake up on the left side of the bed?  I did choose.... and it was school.... go figure that at 7.30 pm I and the whole class realized that the teacher was not coming today... So I waste gas, time showering and getting ready, and missed good and quality TV.... anyway, what can I do about it...   So I'm here now doin' homework... not even good to go and catch a movie... !

      Wow... two days in a row... what am I talking? weather!  It's been two days with nice weather, it feels so "fall" .... love this season, not too cold, windy, with flashes of summer breeze but with the sense of winter around the block... hope it doesn't change.  Today I am alone at home... have some money in my pockets and just a class to attend... what should I do? * Go to class (from 7 to 9 pm); * Go and spent that money, or * Just stay at home doin' nothing but watch TV?  I just don't know, still got a few hours to make my mind though. In other matters, I know is still early to be thinking about winter vacations, but I haven't taken a vacation in like two or more years, this one I want to... so I've been thinking in going to San Francisco and then to Vegas... I'm just crossing my fingers...!!!  Ok, I'll leave is time for me to be watching Golden Girls...!  All this just proves my theory: If I don't have time to be thinking about something but school my life seems kinda the same all days... kinda boring, but SO exhausting...!!!

      Today was a great and emotional day... Get this, my baby brother is an architect...  After years of work, long nights and days without eating, he made his dreams come true... Mom, Dad and I attended the ceremony in which he received a plaque and his diploma.. I was tired, had a deadline and stuff... anyway, I was there and had a horrible time: those long speeches, one after the other... endless boredom... But at the end, they made something no one expected: they showed a movie, well a collection of pictures taken during all their years at school... the most important thing about it is that they started with pictures of everyone when they were kids or babies... When I saw my baby brother up there, his baby picture, I just couldn't hold it.. I started crying ( as I am now ), mom too... Dad, he held in there ( as I was told, by mum, he cried at the ceremony held on a church early in the morning ), I just couldn't... it was an emotional moment...   I am so proud of him... I just don't have words to describe my feelings... just hope that he makes all the right decision he needs to be happy... and wealthy ( j/k )... AND AS I REMEMBER ALL THIS, I'LL KEEP ON CRYING... IS JUST SUCH A GOOD FEELING I CAN'T KEEP IT IN MY CHEST...

      What the f*** !!! My eyes are closing, still I'm in front of this demonic machine!  Now thinking on my full of drama life ( there's an eye opener and a really... and I mean REALLY big kick in my mouth for sayin' it ) I realized that is not all that easy to be a ***  boy in this town... sure I had my share of relations, and my family in their ignorant approach or conduct in their relation with me are happy and so am I, and grateful for it, but somehow it doesn't seems to make it all more easy on me.  I stay late ( and those who know me, know that when I said late is in the full extent of the word ) thinking all nights... I think in a way to be free of all of this or just a way to talk to everyone I care. Why? just don't know. Maybe just a way to make amends to the years that had passed me. Now I know that my social life has been neglected by me, not because of me. As I've said constantly, I just get too comfortable in this bubble... is warm, cozy but in the end or in the passing weeks, it just gets bigger and bigger and yes, oh so lonely... and for those who reads this sh** just have in mind that today I'm in such a good mood...!!!  Now I tried to expand my circle of friends, people to have so much more in common with, and not necessarily "that", but if it is that, just better... before I've tried to make a connection made by levels: first to be ***, then what else we could have in common... in all this years with that tactic I have just made friends with so many people I can count them with a bare and lonely hand... There was this time this person that I really liked... and he had all the qualities I was looking for, but this bubble in a way is stronger than me... I pushed him aside and in the end I never got the chance to know him the way no good christian intended what relations between two guys should be, heck, not even a coffee I took with him... now the guy is moving... and for me this brings memories... it is all that all over again ( something I'll tell u later ) minus the BIG STRONG feelings... I care for this bloke, don't get me wrong, I think we'd have made a great connection, but is not like there were *the big word that lifts everyone spirit* between us. Is more of what could have been... and for real, and with a cold head, this guy maybe would have never given me the hour... anyway... it could've been a great memory....  Now in a more real connection... I think I have been neglecting my friendship with one of my girls: Becka.... but the thing is that I've been really busy with school... she's there all afternoon, I am not, I just take a few classes with the group and some more in the morning... so I just go in and out... and don't have that much time to socialize ( duh!!! see what I mean: time - bubble )... I'll try to make it up to her... but I won't be that articulate 'cause it could set a precedent, and is not like I'm doing something wrong... OK, I should explain, as far as I know, and believe me, I know her, she probably is thinking that I'm giving her the cold shoulder... oh SO not the case..!!! So I'll take her to a movie and for some ice cream..... when I have some time.... hahahahah!!!!    see ya around....!!!

      And I'll keep on going... sad isn't ? ...    I remember the nights I watched as you lay sleeping Your body gripped by some far away dream Well I was so scared and so in love then And so lost in all of you that I had seen But no one ever talked in the darkness No voice ever added fuel to the fire No light ever shone in the doorway Deep in the hollow of earthly desires But if in some dream there was brightness If in some memory some sort of sign And flesh be revived in the shadows Blessed our bodies would lay so entwined  And I will oh I will not forget you Nor will I ever let you go I will oh I will not forget you I remember when you left in the morning at daybreak So silent you stole from my bed To go back to the one who possesses your soul And I back to the life that I dread. So I ran like the wind to the water Please don't leave me again I cried And I threw bitter tears at the ocean But all that came back was the tide.    I will not forget you.

      There you are at night, ready to go to bed. You know it, you will try to, but let's be real, you won't be sleeping at all, at least not during the night hours. Occasionally you take a bath, a nice warm one; then you get ready for a night of endless hours. Sit at the edge of bed, is everything in the place it should be? Pillows, sheet, quilt? Have you turned the lights off already? No? Why not? Oh! Because you know it's no point. Well, look at the floor, see all those remote controls? Should you do it? Do it, I mean, is there anything else to do?   There you are, TV surfing, but there's nothing to see, just infomercials that try to sell you useless stuff. Why someone would need some of stuff? Sunglasses, the mega speed reading, kitchen gadgets, and so and so. And after an hour or more of that idiotic programming you feel so numb. Pop on a video, or a DVD, or listen some music, that seems a better idea. But how many times have you seen the same video? And answer this: have you turned the lights off already? I knew it!  There you are sitting at the edge of your bed, or maybe moving from one side to the other, but always with the same exhausting feeling. So now you stand up. Walk in the room. What's that? You think if you ate something you'll get in the mood. Ok let's try that. Go to the kitchen, open the fridge. Is there anything you would like? Nah, I thought so! But hey, maybe a nice warm glass of milk should do the trick, everyone says so. But you know it never works, don't you? I know, you will try it anyway. Let's go back to the bedroom.  There you are, a glass of milk in your hand, maybe, some cookies or even a sandwich, a peanut butter and jelly one to go with, and again the TV's on. Look around, do you see something to do? No? But I bet you can think of something to do. I know! Working out. You think of that every night. You will be thinking it for at least an hour, and like every other night, you won't do it. See the time, man Is late! So late already, or maybe early, well it all depends on the point of view. But tell me, have you turned the lights off?  There you are, you already ate and drank, thought about doing some exercise but nothing works. What else could you do? And still sitting in bed, uh? Turn your head to the night's table. Do you see it? The same old book that you always try to read but never do. It is even in the same page like the last three times, not because you don't want to read it, but because you always have to start again. Could it work this time? Want to try it? Ok, let's give it a try. Oh man! You will finally turn off the lights! Big step let me tell you, big step!  There you are, at night, with the night's lamp on, in bed, and with a book on your hands. You don't even remember the names of the characters, and maybe, and I said maybe, you don't remember the plot; but it doesn't matter as long as you have something to do. Are you reading or are you thinking? You are thinking about him? I bet you are thinking about him and everyone else, all those people that are asleep, even the ones that are awake. What he might be doing? Not thinking about you, that's for sure!  There you are, thinking in bed, and again, the book's in the floor in the same page and waiting to be picked up tomorrow night. Now, what are you thinking? About how the hell will you sleep if you don't even really try to? Well, ok, do it. Try to sleep. Lye there, put your head on the pillow, close your eyes. Is he holding you in your thoughts?  Why aren't you sleeping? Don't cry, time has passed already. Yeah I know, your head is not an easy thing to turn off. Try it anyway. All is peace, even though you are not asleep, even though you ache for him. Can you hear you breathing? Can you feel the movement of your chest going up and down? How peaceful and quiet.  There you are, lying in bed, eyes closed and almost asleep. What's that? Can you hear it? Oh, and in your face? What's that? Believe or not, the sound is the one of birds, they are chirping, and that in your face is the morning's sunlight. You've been up all night. Are you tired? You are supposed to be ready to go in a few hours. Why are you turning around? Are you going to try to sleep? Have you stopped thinking about him? He did hurt you didn't he? He did break your heart? Have you turned the night's lamp off? Try to sleep, morning's coming.

        I was alright for awhile I could smile for awhile But I saw you last night You held my hand so tight As you stopped to say "hello" oh you wished me well You couldn’t tell that I’d been  Crying over you Crying over you When you said, "so long" Left me standing all alone Alone and crying Crying, crying, crying, crying It’s hard to understand How the touch of your hand Can start me crying  I thought that I was over you But it’s true, oh so true I love you even more Than I did bfore But darling what can I do?  For you don’t love me And I’ll always be Crying for you Crying for you  Yes now you’re gone And from this moment on I’ll be crying, crying, crying, crying Yes crying Crying Over you.  Crying.

      I woke up early this morning, went to school and felt all around good. Later I took a nap, when I woke up, I was sad again. I just don't know how to deal with this. I got played in a horrible way, still, I love him. I have this impulse of seeing him, I want a moment to hug him and kiss him, but, we are just "friends" now... Should I just let him go, or should I say to him that I don't care what happened, that I'll try to win him back, even though as I see, he was never mine.  My heart hurts, my head hurts, sometimes thinking of him I just can't breath... I really love him, and I can't understand why... Am I just so stupid? I feel so bad I even thought of talking to my exbf, but that's not the solution, I won't do to others what has been done to me.  Look, Adrian, I know that if you read this it will be long after the day it was posted, so here it goes: When we were at the movies, I felt that we shouldn't be there, I tried to be as cool as possible and be a friend, but I noticed how you changed. I know now that you don't love me as I do, that's my problem, not yours, and I'll try to work it out. When u left me at Selwicks, I tried not to look back, not to cry, but I did. Sometimes I feel you do stuff just to hurt me on purpose, I don't know. Maybe I need to be apart from you for a few days, but I fear I might loose you all together, I can't let that happen. You are an important part in my life now.  I was reading your emails, man, I don't know what to think... you said you loved me, you said you thought of me, you said I was in your plans... what happened? what really happened?... I'm so angry at you, I could just hit you in the face so you could know how much you hurt me. But in all, I just wish for you to hug me, kiss me and hold me as I try to fall asleep. Tell me you love me even though we know is not true.    Why does the sun go on shining?  Why does the sea rush to shore?  Don't they know it's the end of the world  'Cause you don't love me any more?   Why do the birds go on singing?  Why do the stars glow above?  Don't they know it's the end of the world?  It ended when I lost your love.   I wake up in the morning and I wonder  Why ev'rything's the same as it was.  I can't understand, no I can't understand  How life goes on the way it does   Why does my heart go on beating?  Why do these eyes of mine cry?  Don't they know it's the end of the world?  It ended when you said goodbye   Don't they know it's the end of the world?  It ended when you said goodbye.   The End of the World. Vonda Shepard.

        Fools fall in love in a hurry Fools give their hearts much too soon Just put in two bars of stardust Just hang out one silly moon Oh! theyÂve got their love torches burning When they should be playing it cool I used to laugh but now IÂm the same Take a look at a brand new fool  Fools fall in love just like schoolgirls Blinded by rose colored dreams They build their castles on wishes With only rainbows for beams Oh! theyÂre making plans for the future When they should be right back in school I used to laugh but now I'm the same Take a look at a brand new fool All right!  TheyÂve got their love torches burning When they should be playing it cool I used to laugh but now IÂm the same Take a look at a brand new fool Take a look at a brand new fool.  Fools fall in love. Jennifer Holliday.     When somebody loved me everything was beautiful, every hour we spent together lives within my heart... too much drama, this is my way of healling. Dude, you really hurt me, like nobody did before, and the thing I hate the most is that I don't care... I still love you with all my damn heart... fuck, if being your friend is all I can have, hell, whatever it takes... even though it will hurt. For what it was worth, it was worth all the while... just hope you still care for me.

I just don't know... it hurts so much.    Pride can stand a thousand trials, the strong will never fall But watching stars without you, my soul cried. Heaving heart is full of pain, oh, oh, the aching. 'Cause I'm kissing you, oh. I'm kissing you, oh. Touch me deep, pure and true, gift to me forever 'Cause I'm kissing you, oh. I'm kissing you, oh. Where are you now? Where are you now? 'Cause I'm kissing you. I'm kissing you, oh.   Kissing you. Des'ree.

        I guess I’m just a fool Still dreaming of you But the way the story ended What else can I do ?   You said I was too good to you Too good and too sweet Back then you never turned Bitter and discreet  Breaking up is always hard But this one was harder than the rest But in the end I hope I’ll come out well  I guess I’m just a fool What else can I do ?  I guess I'm just a fool. Jay Jay Johanson.

      Been feelin' up lately... I followed my friends advice and it is having some results... as long as I don't start thinking too much about it, or reading too strong between the lines.  My baby is looking for a new job in San Diego... I don't want him to go! But I won't say anything... is not my call at all. Today we have a month together, I just remembered. Good thing I'm busy with school, so I won't be thinking about him 24/7, is not healthy ;) ... lol!  He's a sweet guy... I need to get new clothes, I've been losing weight and the ones I have are a little too big, specially my shirts. Good thing they are not that expensive here in Mxl...

        If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today? If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way? If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all  I never know what the future brings  But I know you are here with me now We'll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with  I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed? If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head? If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life? If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?  I don't know why you're so far away  But I know that this much is true We'll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with And I wish that you could be the one I die with And I pray in you're the one I build my home with I hope I love you all my life  I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?

      I'm out to one of my best friends. Is a nice feeling the one to have someone to talk to about some of the stuff that hurts you o makes you the happiest.  The one thing I don't know what's going on is the one with my boyfriend. Sometimes I feel not needed at all, not that I want to be thought of 24/7 but the change I feel in him respect me is somewhat that I don't like. I fear that I might need to change the way I behave or maybe just the way I think when around him in order to not feel hurt. I got thinking the other day and is a part of the circle of a relationship, and in this one, I think I am ( again ) the one that needs the most. He loves me? I think he does... With all his heart? I do believe he does... Has he changed? Maybe, now I think he sometimes takes me for granted, or could it be that he is so sure about my love that is never afraid of losing it? ... Well, he got a point there if that's the case.  The main problem is not him, is me. I got hit hard with love. When I get a hug from him, all my body feels at ease, at peace. When is time for him or me to leave, I start to ache for his company... That's how much I love him. I wake up in the morning and see the clock over at the night table and instantly at the moment I see time, I think about him: What's he doing? He must be asleep! Will he call me today? Should I call first?... I think I got dependent on him and is making me feel so down when not around him.  One thing I do feel is his fault is the lost of personal time between us. I remember prior to our first night together that he said to me: I want to be with you, just the two of us, alone in some place where we can be at ease... Now he had the opportunity in two occasions and he just wasted them. I was here, waiting for the moments with him, he showed up, but it was late and...   Now he'll spend this three coming days in Mxl, chances are that if I don't call him in the morning I won't be able to contact him when around the city, 'cause his phone either sucks or in the chance it works it will be in silent mode.  All in all, he is a great person, a laid back kind of guy. He did went with me to the concert and even though I noticed he was not happy about it, he was there with ME. He says he loves me, I might be a fool but I do believe him. When I am with him, aside from the recent facts, I am happy, I feel secure, I feel peace inside. And, maybe is all those feelings the ones I ache for. Today, more in the day, I think I'll be able to move around my thoughts and talk to him... I need to talk to him.  Funny thing, my friend, Becky, met him Sunday night and told me: "He is a player, is what I can sense. All in all is a nice guy." Maybe he is, maybe he is not. At the beginning I thought he was, now he's my bf and I love him with all my heart... And are all the details he has with me the ones that win me over an over.   You know what, is me the one that makes up all this drama; I am the one feeling blue over stupid things; I am the one fixating on stupid behavior by his part ( but he is a kid, he needs that release, that doesn't mean he does not love me ); I am the one writing all this sad stories; why haven't I wrote the way he treats me all the time, the way he subtly touches me on the movies, the way he kisses my hand when we are in the car going someplace, the way he always ( well almost always ) appear in my house with a rose, the way he's not cheap with me, the way he agrees to go out with me in the morning even though he hasn't slept at all, and so much more. If I think I have demonstrated my love for him, he has done the same thing. He loves me, might be getting sick of me riding his hump all the time, but that's something I can change now. We love in a different way, but we love each other... I am needy, what can I say!

      I know two days ago I said I needed a break, now I'm on it again. So I should hit myself in the face for start again about my relation. Anyway.  My bf got himself a new car, and I thought: "great"... Now, I'm not that sure, I know is great for him, he deserves that car, and he is working hard for it ( well... kinda hard, nah, he does work hard ). So why am I not sure about it? Mmmh, it will sound a little bit too immature, well, hey it's me. At the beginning I thought it was jealousy because he has a great car, but in reality, I could care less what kind of car he uses, is the idea of him not needing me to come over his house to pick him up. As an example, today I went over there to buy some clothes, and I wanted him to come with me. He agreed, but I didn't have the need to pick him up or to drop him off at his house ( which would've bought me some time with him alone ), instead, he was there already waiting for me... We went in the store, pick the stuff, paid for it and leave... I returned home and he went his way, so I lost there almost 15 min of his company by the simple fact that he has a car now.  I might be a little childish, but now you know how I react to all this. Now I think I'll miss the nightly drive to his house ( he lives in another city ), go to the movies in my car, he driving it.  ... Today he did something that I didn't like at all. We were having lunch and I asked him: "who loves you?" ... He made a face, a movement, and said: "enough of it already" ... I know I shouldn't say it all the time, it might sound like I'm trying to validate our relationship all the time, but... I mean, is that bad a question?  I think he's growing distant... I know he cares for me... But he  IS  in fact kind of distant lately. If it were for me, I would be with him all day, I am able to hang out doing nothing at all... I don't think he can. Sometimes I feel he's not opening to me. Do I need to work on it or just give him space? The problem for me is that I sympathized easily, and I get depressed so fast and so strong. Ok, I won't ask it again, I'll just acknowledge he loves me and that's just it. ... Becky got in an accident, this hasn't been her week... She's been depressed and I think that sometimes she feels lonely... poor girl.

      Is been great writing and pouring all my feelings and thoughts here, but now, I must take a break... Why? Because I feel that some of the things that have been happening in my life must remain a little more personal. It is true that the blog is an excellent way of therapy, but sometimes I think that exposure is not so good, and could tamper with some of the relations I have, specially the one that matters the most... How? Well, this is a no holds back zone, so I might get sometimes too emotional or too cynical about matters that only concern a couple of persons: Adrian and me. So when I write here, it only shows my side, only shows what I think without even having a discussion with him about the situation or the problem or the feeling, so I don't get, most of the time, his feedback. That's why I'll try now not to get both sides of my life involved: the blog and my boyfriend.  It's been a great ride... But I should hold back some information. It's the natural thing to do. Just one thing before I go and take the new turn on this blog:  Is it normal for me wanting to be with him all time, all day? Is it normal for me loving someone so much that I could do is think and think on him? Is it normal for me wanting to call him all time? Is it normal for me aching for a phone call I know lately I haven't gotten? Is it normal for me hating this distance between us during the day? Is it normal for me feeling good and relaxed every time I see him?   I think and I think and think and think, and it all comes the same:  I love him with all my heart.   Now I am a pessimist, is in my nature, I worry, I cry, I get depressed... But I feel that he loves me, that's why I better focus on it. I'll try to hold back a little bit and give him a little more space, not that I am on his case all day, I just barely see him and I talk to him... But still... I don't want to .... See the pessimist and worried side of my personality was taking over... He's great.. It all comes to that!  Today is our month anniversary... I'm such a girl... I feel I'm in high school...!!!  ... I think Rebecca knows about me... She knows but she just doesn't say a thing... I hate that... I'm better on written words than on spoken ones... So as I know you know, just let me know you know, so I can say: "I knew, you knew..."   'Cause Becky, you are my friend and I care for you... as I know you care for me... I love you girl!

      OK, now here's a movie that can make you feel good about yourself... yeah right!  Kill Bill is a soon-to-be classic. This is a movie I was waiting for a long time, and I was oh so not disappointed.  Now, just a warning, please don't leave the movie theatre with the same fixation that ruined " 28 days later " for most of the people that saw it: The gore.  Kill Bill: vol. 1  is gory, but so much fun to watch. I try not to get technical, 'cause maybe I'm not good at it, I'll just say this: the edition is perfect, the art is great, the movie is elegant, fast passed, a great representation of pop culture.  Uma Thurman as "the bride" is great. Strong, powerful, and sexy. All the female characters hold the flick together and even though you don't get to see more than a hand from David Carradine, just let me tell you that if his part in Vol. 2 is as powerful as it was in Vol. 1 ... WOW! Now the members of DiVAS ( Deadly Viper Assassination Squad ) are great, Liu, Fox, Hanna y Thurman are just great... If this movie would've been done by someone else and with other actors, it would've ended as a B flick just made for idiots... They give great performances, specially Thurman, but all of them have a strong impact when they appear. Even though the movie opens with Thurman, we get a great background on the Lucy Liu character, O-Ren Ishii, but we get it in the form of an anime, which prevented the NC-17 classification. Now I could get all fancy with words in this review, but the hell with it, I'm not a professional, is not like anyone here comes to read my reviews to decide either they'll see it or not, so, with that in mind, I'll tell why I liked it:     1. The girls kick ass... I want to get whipped by any of them... I'm gay, duh! So that's how good they look. 2. Uma kicks ass. 3. Lucy kicks ass. 4. Vivica kicks ass. 5. Darryl kicks ass. 6. The best line and the story to get to it is great, the line been:  "This my finest sword. If in your journey you should encounter God, God will be cut."  7. David Carradine as Bill (so far so good). 8. The fight on the Japanese garden (elegant, solemn, exquisite). 8. Julie Dreyfus as Sofie Fatale is great. 9. Go Go Yubari ( Chiaki Kuriyama ), what a bitch... but so good. 10. An all around chick flick made for boys... now, as my mama said one day:  "we have balls, but ours are way up than yours, and they are bigger"   You know what, just go an see the damn movie, IS GOOD...!!!

      Now I know why my friends, the ones that are with a bf or a gf, don't have time for anything else than their relation. It's been a long time since I had one, so now, I remember how it is to use all your free time in someone that is not one... SO WORTH IT!  I don't watch TV, I have more than 30 hrs on video ( almost since the new season started )... I just barely got a glimpse of Thursday's must see TV. Believe me, two months ago if I was not watching TV I was recording everything directv had to offer me ... now I just have one thing in mind: my baby!  Not even school can put me to rest... this past week I spent all nights with him ( he was at work, so I kept him company ) for almost 5 hrs a night. I ended up tired, but happy! Now that I see things in perspective, I just can't believe I used a whole week just hanging with him... that much I love him... I have a special memory, is kinda bittersweet but anyway, I tend to remember the sweet part: The last night I spent with him, I was tired, so I laid down and tried to have some sleep, he went up to me and then laid down with me... I was comfortable, at peace... I felt, loved, and fell asleep...   You know, that's how I see our relationship, is a mature, sweet, laid back, calm, peaceful relationship... there's the sexual tension of course, well, maybe not tension... desire is the word... and that spice it a bit... I know, that I can count on him anytime I need someone. He will be there for me... and I'll be there for him too. And you know what's the best part? He's funny... he makes me feel loved, like someone cares for me... as much as I care for him... Love you Adrian...!  Later, TV review, featuring: Happy family, las Vegas, Friends, Coupling, etcetera... if you see a pattern here ( NBC ) is 'cause I suddendly lost the signal on ABC, FOX, CBS and teh WB and UP networks... so I was left with private channels and NBC...

       Once Upon a time in Mexico.  It was actually a funny, action-dramedy movie. Really interesting. Banderas, good. Hayek, GOOD. Deep, good. Mendes, ( whip ) good.   The movie.  Is kind of a messy story. Mmh, but fun. It al revolves around "EL" as in "the"... EL is Banderas, el mariachi, who's been recruited by Deep's character to bring down a general ( the one that was in love with Carolina, Hayek's character, and then killed her and the baby girl she had with el mariachi ). Now, is up to here where the plot is somewhat easy to follow, then it all gets tangled in a series of plots and personal vendettas that lets you all confused, but the action is non-stop, so you don't care that much about it. There are funny moments, most of them delivered by Deep. I have read that Deep's characterization holds the movie, but I have to disagree. Yes is true that Deep is great and funny, but I sensed a perfect balance between all characters ( maybe too many to care for all of them, but anyway ), even the sexy part of the movie ( Hayek and Mendes ) is balanced, I mean, you get a share of both females and remember both without one overpowering the other. All around, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, is a great popcorn movie, funny, lots of action, and a really good visual adventure. A great addition to this movie, because he delivers some funny moments without being too there is Pedro Armendariz Jr. as the president of Mexico. Funny.  What I could live without is the picture of Mexico as a sandy, hot and full of folklore, much less when most of the action takes place in Culiacan, Sinaloa, a place with a tropical weather, clean and pretty.  ...  Freddy vs. Jason.  Now this one was a movie I was waiting for a long time. Being a guy that grew up on the 80's and being Freddy the cause of many sleepless nights, this was a movie to remember my childhood. Deception? Mmmhhh, not really! Satisfied? Mmmhhh, not really! Ok, lets get clear. This movie has all the elements that most of us remember from the Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th movies... And the movie does start with a great opener, then, from there is just killing and fights with not much story. Still, a good flick for an auto-cimena or a Friday night with that special someone. After all, as I always say, you better see for yourself if a movie is good or it isn't.

      Is kind of a harsh title, huh? Well, I've been asked a few times now, why do I use this ( the blog ) to write everything I feel?... And after thinking and thinking about it, I got to the conclusion that it makes me feel better. I pour all my emotions and thoughts and I leave with a clean soul, in a way I sweep all my fears and reaffirm all the good things that happen to me.  Clear example was the post almost a week ago. I was feeling down and not knowing why... I got describing everything I felt and suddendly at the end of the post I realized I was being jealous... and that made me feel blue, sad and melancholy. Then as I was writing and thinking about it, I felt great, clean and sad-free.  That's why I write in this blog, not because I want everyone to know what I do, whom am I seeing, whom is making me ache for him, or, why does it feel so sad and great at the same time... Is just my way of saying what I can not sound. Is letting my feelings out without making me feel uncomfortable. Is letting everyone I care for know why do I care and how much I care for them, specially him.   ... Yesterday I did something that still scares me. Is not that I regret it, is not that I didn't enjoy it. Is what it could mean, what could it make us feel, and what direction might it takes us. My fears got kinda mixed today and my senses got all wrapped in a box. I'm kind of numb. I just don't feel. Not as I felt yesterday all morning and afternoon. I barely got a glimpse of a call today. Not by my part, not by his part.   Sometimes I feel I'm not giving all he expects and sometimes I feel I'm not giving all he deserves. At the end, yesterday was like a great meal: great appetizers, good soup, excellent dinner and a sweet dessert, but next day you feel bloated and gassy and in need of an alka seltzer. I feel, like, like I was given a line from a great guy and I fell for it. Is something I know I shouldn't feel, and it makes me look stupid, but, is the reaction I have. And I'm sorry for it. But ok, is 12.03 am and I can't help feeling this way.  I'm obsessive, childish, compulsive, a handful of jealousy, insecurity, etcetera. What the fuck can I do? Or is it that I'm just too cynical and dark?

      Ok, there are no words that can explain what I feel for my boy. He's unique, charming, caring, lovely, fun, sweet, beautiful, dreamy, etcetera, etcetera. Last night he said things to me that I've always dreamed off... I got a little bit scared 'cause I really thought of this as a long and soon to be lasting relationship, I knew this was going to be the one that stuck, the one I'll be having for the next years, but it was always a thought. Yesterday, he confirmed everything. He told me what he expected of this, what he wanted. I was speechless... I couldn't say a thing... I was overwhelmed, scared, excited, full of love for this guy. I just hope ( and I'll work for this to last ).  What I love about him, I just can't put it in words, but let me tell you something, in his eager and funny kind of way, he doesn't pressure me, he cares for me! He has my best interest at hand. I mean, how can you not fall for a guy that makes you his priority? Or at least makes you feel that way. And he does makes me feel that way. He does.  We had a nice chat. Not a chit-chat, a real conversation ( well, most from his part, I was speechless ) of what we expected, what we feel about this, what we wanted to do. It's been a week, today is a week since we got ourselves in this relationship... so far so good... but how can not be that way with him? It just feels right.   Love you Adrian  ( my Bill )

       The Missing.  This is how western should be portrait. Is a slow movie, but is just so beautiful. Go see it. Be ready to leave the place sad and ready to cry. The scenery is so pretty you wish you could ride along them, but not in the same mission. I know this movie didn't get good reviews, still, as I have said before: you should decide if a movie is good or not. It was exactly what I hoped for. I know is long and slow, but if I could bear it, anyone can. Blanchet's is great. Jones is too. The girls are great indeed. Now for those movie critics that are fat and soggy in their behinds, and that seem to have seen to many western movies: a chase is a chase, and until you have done one in the wild, just don't critic this one.     Gothika.  Mmmh. Miss it. Is all I can say. Still as with the one above, go see it in a matinee, so your money lose is less.    Brother Bear.  Oh my God. What a pretty movie. The relation between the cub and the bear is excellent. You'll cry  if  you are not dead inside.

      I've been reading my blog today and is scary how I bend my own rules, which were meant for me no to get heart broken or hurt, still, I break them or bend them as the possible extent they can endure. The result, I got hurt. Just check August 14th ( July 30th ).  I noticed too that I tend to cling on relationships that passed until the moment I meet someone new, then I move on. Is not nice at all. Aside from this fact, I am really glad that I do know me, I can make mistakes but I know what I'm doing. I put a lot of feeling in all I do, in my everyday activities, still, I always have a clear head. And as someone told me once, I am not mischievous, but I do calculate and think all my movements... well, at least I try to.  Most of my archives are relationship related, and that's something I also said wasn't going to happen. But is so powerful the feeling inside that I need to express it. I have a lot of bad poems ready to post, that I made in my hours of class, but I don't know if it is the polite thing to do. Now, with school ending, I'll have a lot of time to think and to reevaluate the way I behave in a relation. What I did? What I didn't do? Was I good? Was I bad? or just hate him... whatever comes natural at the time. In fact, now, if I remember our relation, and I think of all the lies, the way he treated me, etcetera, I just manage to mouth:  bastard!  LOL  It is hard to be friends with someone that uses you, and then tries to be nice. Anyway, I have to reevaluate all my way of life and know what I want. I do know I want something serious, but now I have got in track again and I know Mexicali is not the place for me to live, I want to see the world.  For the moment, I'll put all my energy to get pass this next three weeks and then embrace Winter. Xmas is near, and I don't have this special person to share with. That's maybe the fact that makes me more angry about all this; most of my plans with him had xmas as a deadline. I never go more than a few months ahead, just in case. This time it was good I think this way. I had movies, shopping and trips planned, they all crumbled. Now passing xmas I can make new plans ahead. Just they'll have to be with me in a single mode.  All in all, I'm past all this, I feel fine now. I know I have some issues I have to cover, but those are for me to follow thoroughly. Bastard! Well... later my Matrix Revolutions review... maybe I won't post it, just let me tell you this: What the fuck!

      I have seen "Serendipity" before, in fact, I saw it on the theater. It was a good movie, it leaves you w/a nice feeling. I mean, for what it was at the time, it was good. Now, I saw it on Sunday, and boy, what a movie it was. Is that kind of movie that lift your spirit and makes you feel good and makes you believe in love. And believe me, it does makes you feel great.  ... There are a lot of movies I was planning to see this holiday, but now I'm single again and already I've missed two. So as I see, I'll have to find a friend/date to go and see them.  Is it too soon to start dating again? How much time should I give myself then? Now there are this guys, one seems like a nice bloke and a possible great friend. This other guy is bf material, but I don't want to be in a relationship at the moment, well, I think so. And this other guy could be both, a friend or a bf. Still, am I ready to go full head on this?

         If I listen long enough to you  I'd find a way to believe that it's all true  Knowing that you lied straight faced while I cried  Still I look to find a reason to believe   Someone like you  Makes it hard to live without  Somebody else  Someone like you  Make it easy to give  And never think about myself   If I gave you time to change my mind  I'd find a way just to leave the past behind  Knowing that you lied straight faced while I cried  Still I look to find a reason to believe   If I listen long enough to you  I'd find a way to believe that it's all true  Knowing that you lied straight faced while I cried  Still I look to find a reason to believe   Someone like you  Makes it hard to live without somebody else  Someone like you  Make it easy to give  And never think about myself  Someone like you  Makes it hard to live without somebody else  Someone like you  Make it easy to give  And never think about myself  Someone like you  Makes it hard to live without somebody else  Someone like you  Make it easy to give  And never think about myself   Reason to believe.

      I've read the critic she received from a member of the associated press ( Deepti Hajela ), and maybe for HIM is not a good CD, I'll grant him is somewhat bland, but is GOOD, and "Stupid" does get me, heck I even cried when I heard it.  Sarah's presentation on  Oxyen  was really good. It might have been better if it wasn't Avril Levigne the one that was featured with her, but anyway. I think Dido or someone else with a similar music would've been the choice. Still, if could skip that part, Sarah's performance was excelent. I wish she'd played "Stupid" live, is such a song, or maybe "Answer", people, you have to hear that song. It goes along the path of "I love you" ... just excelent.

         Night lift up the shades let in the brilliant of morning  but steady me now for I am weak and starving for mercy  sleep has left me alone to carry the weight of unraveling where we went wrong  and all I can do to hang on, to keep me from falling into old familiar shoes.   How stupid could I be  a simpleton could see  that you're no good for me  but you're the only one I see   Love has made me a fool set me on fire and watched as I floundered  unable to speak except to cry out and wait for your answer  and you come around in your time speaking of fabulous places  create an oasis that dries up as soon as you're gone  you leave me here burning in this desert without you   How stupid could I be  a simpleton could see  that you're no good for me  but you're the only one I see   Everything changes everything falls apart  I can't stand to feel myself losing control  in the deep of my weaknes I know   How stupid could I be  a simpleton could see  that you're no good for me  but you're the only one I see   Stupid. Sarah McLachlan.

         I am thinking of you  In my sleepless solitude tonight  If it's wrong to love you  Then my heart just won't let me be right  'Cause I've drowned in you  And I won't pull through  Without you by my side   I'd give my all to have  Just one more night with you  I'd risk my life to feel  Your body next to mine  'cause I can't go on  Living in the memory of our song  I'd give my all for your love tonight   Baby can you feel me  Imagining I'm looking in your eyes  I can see you clearly  Vividly emblazoned in my mind  And yet you're so far  Like a distant star  I'm wishing on tonight   I'd give my all to have  Just one more night with you  I'd risk my life to feel  Your body next to mine  'Cause I can't go on  Living in the memory of our song  I'd give my all for your love tonight   I'd give my all to have  Just one more night with you  I'd risk my life to feel  Your body next to mine  'Cause I can't go on  Living in the memory of our song  I'd give my all for your love tonight  (I'd) give my all for your love  Tonight   My All. Mariah Carey.

      Tuesday was the release of the new and long awaited CD from Sarah McLachlan. The CD is called AFTERGLOW, the first single "Fallen" has been going up in VH1's top 20, but still hasn't got up to the top 10. Is a great CD, everyone says so, but maybe timing to market it was not the best. Dido has a new CD too and is somewhat a little more hip and is stealing a lot of place for Sarah. We have to remember that most of Sarah's fans listened to Dido as a comfort while she was in hiatus.  Still, Sarah has started to promote the single and she's looking great. The video is extremely good. Just go and get it. Remember, on Sunday 8th this month, on  Oxygen  there will be a concert with Sarah and Avril Lavigne, and  Lifetime TV  will premier her  Intimate Portraid  on Monday the 24th.  Try to fall in love with her music... You won't regret it.

      How can someone change so fast, and I mean me!  Whatever I think now is so different to what I thought a week ago, any idea I had is so different now. The conception I had about the people that are around me is changing all the time now. Is totally bizarre how could I be so blind and nice. Is totally bizarre how am I able to be nice now. How the color of some people show after the situation. Bizarre!  So what was I thinking? Still, what am I thinking? I'll insist, bizarre!

         I'd like to watch you sleep at night  To hear you breathe by my side  And though sleep leaves me behind  There's nowhere I'd rather be  And now our bed is oh so cold  My hands feel empty  No one to hold  I can sleep what side I want  It's not the same with you gone  Oh if you'd come home  I'll let you know that  All you want  Is right here in this room  All you need  Is sitting here with you  All you want   It's been three years  One night apart  But in that night you tore my heart  If only you had slept alone  If those seeds had not been sown   Oh you could come home and you would know that  All you want  Is right here in this room  All you need  Is sitting here with you  All you want   I hear your key turning in the door  I won't be hearing that sound anymore  And you and your sin  Can leave the way you just came in  Send my regards to her   I hope you've found that  All you want  Is right there in that room  All you need  Is sitting there with you  All you want   I'd like to watch you sleep at night  To hear you breathe by my side.   All you want. Dido.

      I don't even know where to start... school, family? And all because of my fucking depression.  School is jinxed to me at the moment. I just don't know what the fuck is going on there. I got exams next week, but I don't know about what... One of my classes is in the morning and lately I have been sleeping a lot, a lot, so I just don't go to it ( now is my second week not attending )... In other classes I just don't pick up the papers to study... so I'm flunking... Is so not me. And I am getting scared because of it.  Family, for the moment I just don't seem able to spend some time with them alone. I just can't. More in the fact that my mom knows I'm gay than in the fact that I am somewhat depressed. As I have said, she wants to talk to me about him, but I don't want for her to hate him... dunno why... So I am hiding from her. Maybe that's why I spend so much time sleeping.  The only thing good that came out of it is that I did lose weight, and two pant sizes. For the fact that I cried like a baby without his mum, I drank a lot of water and as a result, my skin looks actually good. I fit now in my skinny jeans...!!!

      I feel better now. I've been feeling up this last days. One of the things that made feel better was the knowledge that all I was feeling and thinking prior to the "break up" was true. I always knew something was fishy. U can sense it reading my posts, but at the end I ALWAYS made excuses for his behavior. So, yeah, I knew, but I allowed myself to get hurt because of love.  I'm getting tired of writing about it all the time I get in front of this computer, that's why the first three days I avoid it. Now, is getting colder, and this is the season I wanted to spend with him, is a romantic, melancholy, sweet and full of love one, anyway. I know I'm ok with everything. The good thing of all this is that I know now I'm strong enough; I have great friends that support me; I'm out to almost everyone, and I got to know a great guy that even though toyed with me I still care for.  It will take time for me to not think of what happened and not feel rage and sadness. I did opened my heart.   Mom is kind of trying to know what happened, but so far, is not something I want her to know. Is not for her to make judgments from my relationships. What makes me feel stupid, is that this is the first one I ended getting hurt and I don't care about it. I still care for him and that's why I don't want anyone but me, making judgments about him. Stupid, huh?   Yesterday as I was getting ready to go to school, I was watching sex and the city, and a line there got my attention:  "life is what happened while you are making plans" .  So with this in mind, I can say with all authority, and having last week as a reminder, that life is a bitch! I got so many plans, all of them never included a relationship, and BAM! It happened... Then I got so many plans for it, and BAM! It happened again... Now I'm single, with all my plans in the can and flunking all my subjects at school. I need to get a grip and start moving on with my life.  ... For Neil.  Sorry man I didn't have the chance to talk to you. I'm happy nothing happened to your family and their house. Don't be worried for me. Next time we'll have the chance to talk, for the moment, you know I'm your friend and if you need something just call. Love ya dude.

        Martin Luther      There’s much to talk about lately: my reading, the music I’m listening at the moment, what I’m watching on TV, etcetera. Today I’ll start by responding about why do I put so many lyrics. I’m not proud to say that I don’t know a thing about music, that meaning cords and instruments, but I’m proud of knowing obscure and rare songs that mostly escape the “mass produced” area. This way, to me, music represents a state of feel. I try to find music that reflects my mood and my personality. I’m a drama queen, so most of the music I listen to tends toward drama. Then if you want to know how am I feeling at the moment, pay attention to the lyrics in my posts, they reflect it.  Therefore, in the same matter. What am I listening at this moment? It all depends on the day, and the media. CD speaking, I’m listening to old favs:  Tony Braxton’s “Secrets” (specially tracks 3, 6 and 10);  Vonda Shepard’s “Songs from Ally McBeal”;  Jewel’s “Pieces of you”;  The Red Hot Chili Peppers’ “Californication”;  The Verve’s “Hurban Hymn”;  Maroon 5’s “Songs about Jane”.  Audioslave’s “Audioslave”, and the all time fav, Sarah McLachlan’s “Afterglow” (track 7).   My mp3 player has a mix selection that goes sort of this way: Dido’s “White Flag”; All Saints’ “Never Ever”; Eddie Vedder’s “You’ve got to hide your love away”; Jennifer Holliday’s version of “Fools Rush In”; Rod Stewart’s “The First Cut is the Deepest”; Jay Jay Johanson’s “I guess I’m just a fool” and “Suffering”; Sarah’s “Song for a Winter’s Night” and “Do What you have to Do”; Oasis’ “Stop Crying your heart out”; Lisa Ekdahl’s “It’s Oh so quiet”; Cher’s “Strong Enough”; R.E.M.’s “Everybody Hurts”, and some others.  And my computer is around the 1000 songs, in the future being 3000 as soon as I have the backup disks form the old hard drive. So yeah, I don’t know how to play an instrument, but music is a big part of my life. Music I like because it says something to me, not everyone else.

        Wally Amos      As I was thinking yesterday in the afternoon, when I was taking a bath, I remembered how much I loved taking long, long baths. When I moved to my actual room, I was working and I bought all I needed to make my shower a “pleasure shower”. I remember mom used to look me with caution and not saying anything she wished she had all I had in there. I bought scented oils, catalog body shampoo, a great shower head that gave massages with different water pressure, body brushes, candles, fluffy towels, I had everything. I used to spend more than an hour taking a bath. With time, and as I was getting busier, those long baths were getting fewer, and suddenly they stopped. But yesterday, was different. I don’t know what happened. I just stood there, hot water running down on me and me leaning on the shower wall. I spent a lot of time there and I remebered those long baths of yore ( hahaha! ). Now I recall the nice relaxed feeling, the warm embrace of water in my body, the way it feel like a soul cleansing. And it was just water and soap, nothing fancy, I was just missing some music. At the end, 45 min later, I felt so clean, so relaxed, well, relaxed is not the word I’m looking for… at peace, that’s the one. At peace.

        Fran Lebowitz      This last weeks I’ve been reading a lot, most of the time at night. So far I’ve read four books in two weeks. Now, I’m not the kind of person that pretends to be artsy and all cultural. My books are for entertainment, for my pleasure, not to show off. Anyway I have such a bad memory that even if I tried to quote a book by heart, I couldn't. So with that in mind, I’ve read Timeline, Smillmarilion, re-read Hannibal, The Iron Tower, and I’m in the middle of the Jurassic Park series. Continuing with this, yesterday, well today in the morning really, as I said before, most of my reading is at night and most of the time it dawns on me reading. So today as I was reading JP by Chrichton, I had this impulse to turn on the TV. As I was surfing through the channels, my favorite show and my favorite episode in all TV history was on: Ally McBeal, S3 ep02 “Fools Night Out”. And that is lucky, it was 4.30 am.  Now, you want to know why do I love this one? Ok! It has to do with several ideas, the first one: I’m a drama queen, and I seek it. Second, it introduced me to one of my favorite singers: Jennifer Holliday, aka Lisa Knowles. Third: great soulful music. Finally, this time it hit too near. Actually, when I saw it today, I had the necessity to look for the transcript, print it and read it. I think now is ideal to post some excerpts of it, so you can know how good and great it is. Here it goes:     Note:  "Ally McBeal", created by David E. Kelley; own by David E. Kelley Production and 20th Century Fox Television. This excerpst are taken from  urlLink The Attic Zone Scripts Collection  with some scene descriptions to explain the mood of the scene.     ..."Fools Night Out"...     ...Richard’s Office. MARK NEWMAN ( the minister ) and RICHARD FISH ( playing with a recorder )     MARK NEWMAN:  I've kept myself into a situation, and I don't know how to handle it.  RICHARD FISH:  What kind of situation ?  MARK NEWMAN:  I've been in a relationship... ( playing with the recorder and it starts to ive feedback, RICHARD FISH stops it )  RICHARD FISH:  Sorry. She's married ?  MARK NEWMAN:  No !  RICHARD FISH:  Guy ?  MARK NEWMAN:  No !  RICHARD FISH:  Sheep ?  MARK NEWMAN:  Would you just let me talk ?  RICHARD FISH:  Yeah. Go ahead.  MARK NEWMAN:  She's the music supervisor of our choir. She also sings in the choir. She's the one you prevailed upon to sing that short people song ?  RICHARD FISH:  Oh, Lisa...  MARK NEWMAN:  Lisa.  RICHARD FISH ( naughty ):  How was she ? I bet she was....  MARK NEWMAN:  Richard, please ! Obviously we weren't married, and I'm the minister. The minister and somebody from the church, I mean, it doesn't exactly make me an altar boy, does it ?  RICHARD FISH:  If you were an altar boy you'd be with a priest. Kidding. Bygones... What's the big deal ? Consenting adults, even unmarried...  MARK NEWMAN:  I'd really appreciate if you let me get through this ?  RICHARD FISH:  Of course.  MARK NEWMAN:  The relationship ended two months ago, I ended it. And it was very painful for her. And since then, the songs she's been singing for our services, well... I feel they're directed at me !     ...Church. MARK NEWMAN is giving a sermon. ALLY MCBEAL, RENEE and RICHARD FISH in the audience.    ( Band starts playing, LISA KNOWLES is standing up in the middle of the choir, she looks at MARK NEWMAN and starts singing )  LISA KNOWLES ( singing ):  I'm so tired of being alone / So tired of being on my own / Won't you help me / Please just as soon as you can / I guess you know...  RICHARD FISH:  This couldn't exactly be a hymn ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  It's an anthem ! I like it.  RENEE:  She's singing to you.  ALLY MCBEAL:  And you !  RENEE:  You got that !  LISA KNOWLES ( singing ):  Love me if you will / Love me if you will / So tired of being alone ( everybody is up in the audience, dancing, including RENEE and ALLY MCBEAL. RICHARD FISH gets up too ).  RICHARD FISH:  Doesn't relate to me.  LISA KNOWLES ( singing ):  I'm so tired / I'm so tired / I'm so tired of being alone... Yeah !  Audience cheers.      ...Cage & Fish office. JOHN CAGE's office, JOHN CAGE, RICHARD FISH and MARK NEWMAN. RICHARD FISH and MARK NEWMAN against some book shelves.     RICHARD FISH:  Tough to fire her, people in that church enjoyed it.  MARK NEWMAN:  Clearly this is not right !  RICHARD FISH:  Even so you slept with her, Mark, she can run that sexual harassment card right up your collar.  MARK NEWMAN:  But I haven't done anything !  RICHARD FISH:  You're a man, you're breathing... Under title VII you're liable.  MARK NEWMAN:  We had a relationship, it ended !  RICHARD FISH ( sitting on JOHN CAGE's desk, JOHN CAGE sitting behind his desk ):  Thing is, that song last night wasn't overtly directed at you  MARK NEWMAN:  So what, you just let her keep doing this ?  JOHN CAGE:  You need to mediate. We need someone who speaks the language of loneliness.      ...Ally's office.     ALLY MCBEAL:  Why me ?  RICHARD FISH:  Because we think you can tackle into her despair.  ALLY MCBEAL:  Why ?  RICHARD FISH:  That sense of utility that comes with knowing no matter how long you live you'll be going alone, uncoupled, and yet charging for it, just the same, never under the false assumption it'll get any better, you're the who-know she might listen to.  ALLY MCBEAL:  Thank you Richard, I live to help others cope.     ...Church. ALLY MCBEAL and LISA KNOWLES walking up stairs with books in their hands.     LISA KNOWLES:  Is he suing me ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  No, no, not at all, but he gets concerned with your choice of music... ( arriving in a room with the choir robes )  LISA KNOWLES:  People tell me they love it. ( putting down the books on a chair )  ALLY MCBEAL:  So you have ? Kind of shifted your tone, since you broke up ?  LISA KNOWLES:  It's the only way I've had to deal with the pain. I've always expressed myself through music. I don't think the congregation picks up on it.  ALLY MCBEAL:  He does.  LISA KNOWLES:  Well he should. ( taking off her robe ) Do you know what he did ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  Well, relationships end for a lot of reasons...  LISA KNOWLES:  Do you know what he did ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  No.  LISA KNOWLES:  He changed his heart.  ALLY MCBEAL:  Excuse me ?  LISA KNOWLES:  That's the full explanation. We talked of marriage, we were in love, then suddenly, he says "I've had a change of heart". Doesn't wanna see me anymore.  ALLY MCBEAL:  Well...  LISA KNOWLES:  You don't just leave the scene of an accident. You mow somebody down, you at least stop, check on the victim.  ALLY MCBEAL:  Lisa...  LISA KNOWLES:  I don't sing these songs to hurt him, I sing them to help me. They're my only release. If he doesn't like listening, he can just leave the room. Don't tell me he doesn't know how to do that ! The man knows how to leave a room, trust me !     ...Church, MARK NEWMAN and ALLY MCBEAL walking along the aisles.     MARK NEWMAN:  So she's still gonna sing those songs ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  Well, if it works out her pain, and the congregation enjoys it !  MARK NEWMAN:  This is a house of God !  ALLY MCBEAL:  Well, you're the only one that seems to be bothered, Mark. I want to ask you a question. Why have you never really discussed the break-up with her ?  MARK NEWMAN:  I discussed it, I just told her...  ALLY MCBEAL:  Change of heart, yes. Did you love her ?  MARK NEWMAN:  At one point.  ALLY MCBEAL:  Why did you stop loving her ?  MARK NEWMAN:  I don't know, I just did. ( he sits )  ALLY MCBEAL:  You just did ? ( she sits next to him ) Did you ever bother asking yourself why ?  MARK NEWMAN:  Listen...  ALLY MCBEAL ( starting to get angry ):  Maybe it had something to do with stuff you were going through, maybe there were outside forces, maybe you have commitment problems. Lord knows you must take that "till death do us part" stuff seriously !  MARK NEWMAN:  What are...  ALLY MCBEAL:  Did you seek counseling ? Did you do anything to explore what may have caused you to stop loving her or did you just go "Change of heart, see ya" ?  MARK NEWMAN:  Whose side are you on here ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  Maybe hers.  LISA KNOWLES ( from behind them, they turn around ):  What was the warning, Mark ? How about "I'm feeling different" ? How about "I'm not so sure"? Why is it always great with men right up until they run ?      ...ALLY MCBEAL walking in the street, with flashbacks of BILLY THOMAS and her when he told her he was leaving.     ALLY MCBEAL ( To BILLY THOMAS ):  I choose the law too. But I choose Boston ( The song stops like a vinyl scratched and flasback stops too ).  ALLY MCBEAL stops walking, suddenly realizing something.   ALLY MCBEAL:  It had nothing to do with going to Michigan !     ...ALLY MCBEAL at the bar, looking into nothing, sitting at the bar, alone, GEORGIA THOMAS comes in.     GEORGIA THOMAS:  Hey !  ALLY MCBEAL ( startled ):  Georgia ! Hey !  GEORGIA THOMAS ( sitting next to her ):  You're drinking ? ( she motions the bartender )  ALLY MCBEAL:  No, no that's just... vodka. I'm getting ready to drink it.  GEORGIA THOMAS:  What's the matter ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  Oh, nothing.  GEORGIA THOMAS:  Nothing ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  Nothing I can talk to you about.  GEORGIA THOMAS:  Ah, Billy !  ALLY MCBEAL:  Yep.  GEORGIA THOMAS:  What now ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  Lisa Knowles. She was saying how, you know, how when men break up with women, they're running away like they're fleeing the scene and then... It hit me. Billy didn't break up with me because he had to go off to Michigan to make law review, he went to Michigan to get away from me. That was just his way of fleeing the scene. Am I right ? ( GEORGIA THOMAS says nothing ) I am right. He didn't have to go that far. Did he formerly have to go all the way to Michigan ? ( She realizes ) He met somebody who was at Michigan. He met you, while he was still with me.  GEORGIA THOMAS:  I didn't know about you.     ...Church. LISA KNOWLES (sitting at a piano) and ALLY MCBEAL.     LISA KNOWLES:  Singing in a bar ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  This could be something you would really enjoy. It's a forum. You need a forum. And, if you agree, I've persuaded Mark Newman to sit down and talk to you.  LISA KNOWLES:  I don't need to sit down and talk with him !  ALLY MCBEAL:  I've... I thought you did. He's willing to address the break-up if you want.  LISA KNOWLES:  He is ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  Says he is. I'll be there as mediator.  LISA KNOWLES ( hopeful ):  Does he want to mediate ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  No, he's not saying that, he's willing to sit down and talk about what happened, at least from his side.  LISA KNOWLES:  A lot of people come to this bar ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  Great music at this place...  LISA KNOWLES:  It is a good idea to sit down with him, right ? It's better to know.  ALLY MCBEAL:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is better.     ...MARK NEWMAN's office. MARK NEWMAN's sitting behind his desk, ALLY MCBEAL and LISA KNOWLES in front on it.     MARK NEWMAN:  I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say.  LISA KNOWLES:  You've had the whole night to think about it. That's all you could come up with ?  MARK NEWMAN:  What do you want me to say ? ( LISA KNOWLES gets up and starts to leave )  ALLY MCBEAL:  Hold on, Lisa. ( to MARK NEWMAN ) That's not what this is about, you trying to figure out what she wants you to say, and you're not gonna sail through this like some funeral where the church is double booked ! Now what happened ? Give her that.  LISA KNOWLES:  Was there somebody else ?  MARK NEWMAN:  No !  LISA KNOWLES:  Then what Mark ? What ?  MARK NEWMAN ( getting up ):  It just wasn't you. It was never ever going to be you.  LISA KNOWLES:  You said it was. ( ALLY MCBEAL walks away from them, to the window, looking outside )  MARK NEWMAN:  Because I wanted to believe it, I was desperate to. Lisa, you're the best woman I've ever known, your values, your kindness, your beauty, I mean you're everything I've ever looked for, when I finally found you, I felt for sure that I'd fall so deeply in love, I kept waiting for it to happen, but... It didn't.  LISA KNOWLES:  You never loved me ?  MARK NEWMAN:  No I do, I still do. But I've known greater love with women who for other reasons weren't right (ALLY MCBEAL looking outside the window, sad and pensative, maybe feeling related). Look, I knew that marrying you would be the smart thing to do, I mean, you'd be a good mother, we'd be great companions, the most practical thing I could have ever done would have been to marry you, but part of me would have also died inside because... I have no passion for you (LISA KNOWLES closes her eyes in total pain, soul pain). You know I actually used to pray, "God, let me fall in love with her more, please, let me feel it". ( LISA KNOWLES looks sad ) Should I have told you all that ? Do you feel better knowing ? ( LISA KNOWLES puts her index finger on his mouth and looks totally sad ).     ...Elevator in the lobby. ALLY MCBEAL and LISA KNOWLES get out, LISA KNOWLES carrying an outfit in a cry cleaner's plastic bag.     ALLY MCBEAL:  You don't have to rehearse first, Vonda just thought...  LISA KNOWLES:  No, I definitely want to. I don't need to be humiliated twice in one day, thank you !  ALLY MCBEAL:  You know you don't even have to do it tonight, the invitation's open.  LISA KNOWLES:  Trust me, I need to sing tonight. After that.   ALLY MCBEAL:  Are you OK ?  LISA KNOWLES:  I think so. At least I understand it, Ally.  ALLY MCBEAL:  Yeah. Knowing is good.  LISA KNOWLES:  Actually, you know what the worst thing is ? Suppose he hadn't broken it off. I'd be married to a man who wasn't in love with me.  ALLY MCBEAL:  That would be worse.  LISA KNOWLES:  Oh God, can you imagine ? Well, I'm gonna go rehearse. I'l see you down here later ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  Are you kidding ? I will be there.  LISA KNOWLES:  OK !  ALLY MCBEAL:  Break a heart ! ( LISA KNOWLES looks at her, hurt ) Leg ! ( LISA KNOWLES smiles and leaves )     ...The bar downstairs, LISA KNOWLES singing "Fools rush in".     LISA KNOWLES ( singing ):  Fools fall in love in a hurry / Fools give their hearts much too soon / Just play them tunes of stardust  Camera pans RENEE, Elaine, ALLY MCBEAL in the bar   LISA KNOWLES ( singing ):  Just hang out one silly moon  While LISA KNOWLES sings, shots of RICHARD FISH and LING WOO in a restaurant having fun, of GEORGIA THOMAS in bed doing cross-stitching, of BILLY THOMAS alone in his office, of JOHN CAGE buying a rose in the street for NP, of the bar and MARK NEWMAN entering, of RENEE and ELAINE slow dancing with the twins, of ALLY MCBEAL smiling at LISA KNOWLES, of ALLY MCBEAL walking alone in Boston, of BILLY THOMAS in the office, of images of the discussion between LISA KNOWLES and MARK NEWMAN.   LISA KNOWLES ( singing ):  And they've got their love touch hands firmly / When they should be playing it cool / Oh I I used to laugh but now all I understand shake the hand of a brand new fool / Fools fall in love just like school girls / Blinded by rose colour dreams / They build their castles / They build their castles of wishes / With only / With only bright balls for ??? / I lose enough / But now I understand / Shake the hand of a brand new fool / That's what I am / That's what I am / That's what I am / Shake the hand of a brand new fool.    End Credits     Isn't enough to cry for? Ah the drama.

        Homer      So as I was driving to the cinema, ready to see ( again ) the third and sorrowfully the final installment on the Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Return of the Ring, I opened my car's windows and let the cold wind hit me in the face. It was a great moment. Solitude. Cold. Then the natural and logical call of disgust from my companions, yelling they were cold. A call back to reality.  Those have been my days. Not much to be happy for, at least, my life fits my blog title. How fun for me! ( sigh ). I guess I'm just bored. Tired of the town. I need my friends and take a vacation. The trip to NY fell, so did the one to Mexico City. I've spent to much on me lately, too much on thing not at all necessaries.  Am I that whinny? I think I am. It scares me!  Well, all in all I saw LOR, the return of the king. What a magnificentent piece of cinema. Maybe it wasn't necessary the last minutes of the movie, most that've read the book new about the fate of the fellowship, and the ones that didn't could have easily managed to guess the rest of it since the moment Frodo woke up and saw all  together on Minas Tirith. Still, is nice to see a book that one loves so much into something that sticks a lot to its essence, and gives a great representation on the cinematic format. I thought the last sentence on the book was as great as Tolkien could go, with a sense of coldness that pictured the natural sense of life: we have to move on. The movie makes those words look even deeper: we have to move on, but still caring. That "I'm back" is just great. Now I think that in the last three years a lot of the people I know, included myself, expected december just to see a part of the LOR trilogy, now what? As once I read, at least is great to live in this time, were great books are represented as no one can imagine, as good as they can get, is just an explosion that covers all senses but smell.  Anyway, at the end of the movie I rushed home to change and get ready to school. I was so annoyed of those kids on the theater, man they were a bunch of brats. To my surprise I found a professorless school, with lots of vexed students. Why didn't they tell us that we weren't having classes? What's the point on spending almost an hour on the road, fighting traffic just to get in time to a closed school?  As I was going back home, I spent a lot of time thnking in the car. Too much thinking. All my fears came to mind. All my anxieties. All my love problems. All my heart problems. All my not-moving-on issues. I'm a drama queen, there's no need to ask. Still, I hope this christmas days won't be tainted by... This is my most favorite season, the one I expect with so much love and it would much hurt me to be ruined this year, since I so do need the cheering up of the season.  In other issues, well not others, just maybe in other degree. Mom is great with me, but at the sheer sign of the word gay by any of my brothers or in the tv, she just shut herself if Im around. I know she has issues or just needs time to cope with all of it, but it hurts. I'm afraid to be totally alone at any moment of the day with her, 'cause I don't wish to be interrogated.

                                                                                                                                    Samuel Johnson        A year ago I was at the movies watching Lord of the Rings the Two Towers. I took my brother and his friend for a matinee. In the middle of the movie it hit me, I was single for more than a year. I got depressed. I got so sad that I didn't leave home for two weeks. I didn't do anything to resolve my depression. I didn't date, I didn't try to. Now, I'm in the same position. I try now to know how I managed to believe all this weeks that I was ok, that I've moved on. I haven't. Situations like this one made me realize that it still hurts.  It's been long since. All this time I've tried to put my mind to work. I've tried to keep me so busy that the only way to go at the end of the day would be to sleep. I succeeded, at some level. Still, everything reminds me. Some smell, a movement, a dream ( those are the ones that hurt the most ), a word, a song. Now, what's the worst? The knowledge that I am the only one clinging to this, and is just stupid of me.  As today was watching SATC reruns, I cried like a baby. It felt good, but left me thinking. Was sincerity what I needed? I think it was. After all, I was feeling miserable for two weeks prior to "the moment". Would I go back? With cold head I'd say no. With heart, in a second. Even though I know it would've never worked. Somehow, and I don't know why, I think it was my fault. And maybe, well, not maybe, THAT is what's killing me. I keep roaming about everything, all the details. Damn my intelligence. I managed to know everything without even trying: mail accounts left opened, cell calls, etcetera. Still, I kept my mouth shut. Stupid of me. I just allowed myself to keep falling in love and then be crushed for two persons that don't deserve all this time.  I know I'm smart enough to get even. Heck, I'm smart enough to give enough pain. I love vengeance. But I love him. Slap me in the face, please.  In all this process, I may even treated some people the way he treated me, and I am so sorry for it. I know I'm not ready to date them, but not even as friends? Why do I have to hold back? Why do I have to make all this so complicated? Maybe, because I know now, this is the second time I've been in love, and the first time someone breaks my heart, on purpose.

        Albert Camus      I woke up on Friday morning at around 2 a.m. I was dreaming and it was a dream that has been coming on and off for the past month. Being in elementary school, most of my friends were girls, but as I moved to Junior High, I found three of the best persons I could find. They were my first real male friends: Israel, Armando and Fernando. They were intelligent, funny and totally there for me, most of the time. I think that in the long run I was a good friend, not as good as them anyway, I had issues. As people grow and move on to something new, High school was the point for me to leave them, not that I wanted, but I was the only one going to this other High School. As time passed, we tried to be in contact, but all seem a little too different, specially by my part. As I said, I had issues, I never let someone come too near because I was a closet case. So I started losign contact.  With time, I found Fernando again and we have tried to keep in touch, but he's in Chicago, so aside for the occasional e-mail, there's not much to said. Important point is the fact that our lives are totally different and in really, really different places. Armando is a no find. I don't seem able to reach him. I don't think he even lives in town anyway. But the one I miss the most is Israel. I don't know why... Well I do. He was my very first best friend. He had a similar sense of humor as the one I have. He was cool, and a fine person. For you to understand me, picture it: if I see him now, after all this time without seeing him ( almost 6 or 7 years ), and I propose to go on vacations next weekend, he would say yes and he'll rent the car. That's how easy going he was.  Now my dreams are about him somehow. I am in different places, say at the mechanic, at the store, at the dentist, etcetera, and in some way or in other he's there, smiling and saying we should meet to have a drink so he can introduce me to his wife ( btw, he must be married by now )... Sometimes, the dream is a memory of junior high... LOL, well I never said they were normal.  At the time I was such a dork ( well, still am ) and he was so ahead of me. Ok, to get a sense of how ahead of me he was, if he was gay, he would be transgeder and pregnant... Man I miss them so much. With Fernando, my relationship just turned awkward and a little distant, even at the end of junior high, he started to resent me and I don't know why. With the others I was the one that started to keep distance between us for no reason at all. In fact I have some memories in which I saw them and I just turned around without saying "HI" ... I'm so ashamed of it now...!  When I think in all this people that are asked what they regret in their lives, what would have they done different, and their answer is always "not a thing", I just start to think on them and for me is losing those relations the only think so far that I regret. But in fact keeping in touch with friends is not one of my best attributes, I just don't know how to do it. Sometimes I have this impulse of taking the phone and call Israel's parents and leave a message for him... I want to be his friend again. I would love to be in contact with all my junior high friends and classmates... Those were by far the best three years of my life... A lot of memories, and most of them make me laugh.  So if you know an Israel Aguirre Gastelum, tell him Rogelio Becerra Cifuentes would love for him to send an e-mail to r13639 at hotmail.com... Yeah, I miss them a lot. Anyway I'll leave you, I'll send a mail to Fernando now.

        Dag Hammarskjold          The winter here's cold, and bitter  it's chilled us to the bone  we haven't seen the sun for weeks  to long too far from home  I feel just like I'm sinking  and I claw for solid ground  I'm pulled down by the undertow  I never thought I could feel so low  oh darkness I feel like letting go   If all of the strength and all of the courage  come and lift me from this place  I know I could love you much better than this  full of grace  full of grace  my love   So it's better this way, I said  having seen this place before  where everything we say and do  hurts us all the more  its just that we stayed, too long  in the same old sickly skin  I'm pulled down by the undertow  I never thought I could feel so low  oh darkness I feel like letting go   If all of the strength  and all of the courage  come and lift me from this place  I know I could love you much better than this  full of grace  full of grace  my love   Full of Grace.

        Christina Rossetti      As I was sitting yesterday at night, just killing some time, and also reflecting on everything that has been done in my life, I got to the point of drowning myself in desperation... mmh, maybe that's not the word. Desperation? I think frustration, should be the one. I was there, thinking and thinking... That's all I seem to do lately. It got to the point in which I felt out of breath, sad, lonely and ultimately bored. I got vocation's anxiety, and it made me feel poorly in shape. In reality is not at all just that, we know what I am talking about, don't we? I keep torturing myself, music-wise, movie-wise, even food-wise. I just keep coming and coming to it. Everyone tells me to get a grip and start moving around... I seem unable to do it. Anyway, what's to do? What's to do when the only way to meet someone is compromising for the things you just don't want to do? And in the case you find someone this way, how true the relationship is if it got to you in a way that does not reflect your life? ... I think, that maybe I lost a chance with someone that could've been the real deal just because I did not have the balls to move on. Now he moved on. LOL, ironic?  My friends try to give me advice, and in fact they just say what I know is true already. Let's be clear, I know my feelings are all wrong, still, I think that it was a long time since I felt this way, since I felt something at all. It was so long ago, that I was numb. Now even depression is a way of feeling. Bastard! All in all, I try to live my life, be busy, this four weeks have been a roller coaster of situations, from the most normal and simple to the big and scary ones. Three of my best friends, my closest friends are tying the knot and it just made me feel depressed. -I know, I know, I'm selfish, I should be happy for them, I am, for real. Just, mmh, well ok, I always think of me first-.   On Monday night we ( my friends and I ) were talking about it over dinner, suddenly, as one of them was so happy for her situation, I just felt miserable, totally miserable. It made me remember so much. -Why does everything seems bittersweet when you are alone?-. Alejandra, that's my friend's name, said that she is getting married because is the best decision for her, and she doesn't want to be 30 and thinking "what could've been?" She asked for advice, and I just stood there, sitting and staring at the wall, fork in hand. Flashback. I said to her that " what could've been? " is not an option. Now, I think of Neil and I say the same. What could have been? -Why does a mature decision, a decision that was made with all heart and total mind still hunts? It's the what could have been factor... I keep coming to it, and I keep tracing my relations, all of them had that one as a bar, and it always has been a high one. Still, I don't think moving with him to Boston would have been the right choice, I was young, and maybe too immature. Yes, we were the same age, but he had a different life than the one I had then, and still have and even so, I keep thinking: what would've been?-. I miss him! Ha ha ha, how can you love two at the same time? None is near, none is in contact, one I lost contact with, the other one  is not in love with me. Ah, the Tangled Web We Wove... Humans are the only ones that get themself in this position. And we love it. Don't we?  Monday the 12th was my birthday and I got all the love from family and friends... One of the saddest day so far. I'm so upbeat am I not? LOL...! To make matters worse my ex-boyfriend's ( The big C ) birthday is the 13th, I was compelled to call and say hi... But no, no, no, no... That would've been a really bad decision. Anyway, for those who care and read this: Love!   urlLink    ...&nbsp; urlLink

        Jean Cocteau       Capricorn in 2004: Getting ready    2004 may be one of the busiest years you've had in a long time. You've had a number of career successes in recent years, and you want to keep that impetus going. So you'll be working as hard as ever. Your personal life is likely to be quite fulfilling. Your love life will have its ups and downs, but if you take the time to communicate with your mate, all should be worked out, because there's no lack of love between you. As the year ends, you'll be more than ready for 2005 and its opportunities.    urlLink MSN Astrology

        John F. Kennedy      This blog was intended to be posted on the week of February second. But instead of moving everything around I'll post it today... Is nothing special, but here it goes:   ....   As a beginning school is not to much different, but sure it is cozy. Ok, not cozy at all, but it keeps you a lot busy. Days pass, days come, and still everything looks the same... Thank God! I am a creature of habit.  At the moment, my only concern is that if I was an appliance, I would have returned myself... LOL!!! Anyway, I have the most nice schedule now... Also I'll be doing some work at the SRE. So I'll be quite busy, I'll be up from 7 am to 3 pm and then to school again in the afternoon. So far so good.  In other matters, Sarah's concert at the Sports Arena in San Diego will be on Monday July 12th ( as most of us knew ).... Now a friend of mine told me the tickets will be up for sale on February 9th ( That I did not know, so thanks Angel ). San Diego will be the fourth city she'll perform in the new tour... I just hope it'd be as good as Mirrorball.   For what is worth, I have my credit card ready to buy my ticket. I just want to hear  Ice cream  live and then I can sleep forever.  Now I want to write about something that makes me cringe: Why did I behave like a child when it came to Garcia Marquez? As I wrote in other post, this past vacation days I spent most of my time with my BIG nose in a book, several of them to be exact. I went from the tech-sci fi to Horror, not leaving mystery and fantasy novels. The list is large: Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Hannibal, The Iron Tower, Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes Compilation, Timeline, The Hobbit, The Da Vinci Code and the one I'll refer today. One Hundred Years of Solitude by Garcia Marquez is a wonderful story, a mix of reality and fantasy. Magical. Later I'll post something about it, for the moment just read it.   ....    Update : I'm expected to spent a whole week in San Diego prior to the concert, but I still don't have my tickets. I'll go on Monday to buy them I just hope I'll get good seats. Spring Break is SO near, I just want to get the hell out of here.

        Jean Nidetch       Sat Feb. 21, 2004 by  urlLink Astrocenter.com      Someone   is keeping secrets from you. We all have private issues we don't wish to share, dear Capricorn, but this situation affects you. Your intuition will probably tell you who this person is. Try to get them to open up without exerting pressure. In addition, unfinished tasks and chores could be driving you crazy. You may try to run through them like a steamroller, which can cause too much stress. Get the most crucial done, and let the others go. Tonight: relax with a movie.     I mean, duh! ... But four months later.

        Ally McBeal      Yesterday I think I was in one of those days that one just does not know a reason of why we do what we do. I was a little bit weird all day. I woke up early and did my Yoga routine then headed to school. At 11 in the morning I had nothing to do and was all around tired so when at home I slept. I had in mind just a few hours of sleep, I even adjusted the alarm to wake up and eat. I don't remember much, just killing the alarm and then going back to sleep. I woke up around 5 in the afternoon. Feeling a little odd, a little down, totally different as the way I have been feeling lately. Anyway, I got ready and all dressed up to go to school. I arrived, I had a class at 7 pm so I got there a little early, just ready to read some essays I had as a homework which I did not do early. I was alone in the classroom, the rest of my classmates were not there because they did not have the 5 to 7 class, so I sat there alone just reading. When class started and I was with my friends, not a joke, not a mumbled answer from one of the guys at the back to the teacher made me laugh. I was just  staring at the board. I was so sick with everyone's opinion on the topics. I concurred with some, other's I did not care for, specially the ones that got all philosophic when the answer was plain there, I mean, C'mon guys if the teach asks why the planets have a social impact on us, don't start with the ramifications of the way the human thinks and the abstract nature of human reasons to act... Just say:  at day we live, at night we sleep ... As simple as this... Latter we can have a philosophical debate about man... Ugh.. So tired of all that shit!  Well, finally, at the end of class I went down the stairs with Linda and Alejandra after, lets just say it, a FUNNY moment with Iván, which was in the seat in front of me. So anyway, we were leaving school and we just say bye, not a conversation, not a thing. So as I started strolling down the street, 'cause I park my car outside school grounds so I can take a walk everyday, I just ...When I realized were I was, and what time it was, I just could not believe it. I did not know how I got there, why I was there and most of all, why I did feel so good about it, it came natural to me. I was about 3 minutes from el Centro, CA. I crossed the border and have been driving for about 20 minutes when I notice what I was doing; and we all know why I was doing it. I got there and turned back. Depression. But it was sweet and all musical. I came back sad and misty eyed but singin' with all my heart and lungs. Life! We're not only wired to want what we can't have, but we're wired to want what we don't want. I just wish someone could say to him: " Bring our boy " ... Ah Carrie Bradshaw, how lucky you are!

        Eugene S. Wilson      I thought that yesterday would be depression central, specially at night. It turned out to be not. I had a great time. It was a small wedding party, filled with great people, most of whom I knew and cared for. Linda, as I stated yesterday brought her boyfriend and along the ride they brought me... So I was the third wheel... That's when everything went uphill. For a time now I've been thinking to get along with Linda's bf 'cause I care for her and he's been in the picture longer than me, so at the end he has the upper hand. So yesterday I tried to be nicer and more talkative. Turns out he's a lot like me. What I did not know was that he knew I was gay. It all came up this way:  I've been planning a trip to Lake Tahoe for the summer vacations, in the picture is Linda, Marcos ( Linda's bf ), Alejandra and me. Well, in the car and at the party he asked me to explain to him what was the deal with the vacation, how long we would stay? How we'll gonna get there? Etcetera. At the party he brought back the issue and asked who would be my companion. I said Rebecca or Alejandra, he replied -"what about a male friend"- ...Oh ok! I think I turned red and as with this subject my heart started pumping blood to my head... You know, I felt a little lighter than usual; plus he had a grin in his face. It seemed it took a little courage for him to ask that 'cause he was a little blushed himself. Anyway, I explained I did not want to do it, bring a friend, a male friend I mean. So we started talking and he asked some questions and asked for some gay slang... It was very funny. I had a great time all in all. And as he knew Adrian, he asked about us. Not a good thing to remember on the dawn of valentine's day, so I had to cut to the short version of it:  "It jus did not work, but we are friends"  ( cut to the scene in where Alejandra, Linda and Rebeca rolled their eyes and started moving their heads in disagreement... Hey I'm human, I need friends! ).  The way back was a moment to remember too. We all had a little too much Tequila and Buchanan's in our blood; so Marcos started asking more questions. -What about the gaydar? When did you know you were gay? What about your first bf? What's the deal with S&M? Why all you "people" are so smart and fashionable? How do you do to understand women so good? Do you hit on straight guys?- An awkward but a funny night. He even tried to fix me up with one of his friends... LOL! ... I had to pass on that chance. In all this, Linda was so funny and supportive.  Now the wedding. I won't talk about it 'cause that's personal. The party I can comment on it. It was funny, it was simple, it was friendly. This was the first time I have met the guy and just let me tell you: O...Kay! Anyway, I just wish Alejandra happiness or half of his state. Whatever comes first.

        Wendy Wasserstein       Tomorrow will be my friend's wedding, Alejandra's wedding. I'm invited to the ceremony and to the party afterwards. My friend Linda is going too, she will be my companion to the ceremony but she'll bring her boyfriend to the party later at night. I did not want to say something near Valentine's day, but how much can someone take? I will be attending a wedding a day before V day and I'll be spending the first hours of the afore mentioned holiday alone in a wedding party. I thought I had everything under control, but I don't. I can't... I can't do it all on my own. I got to a point of asking myself and fear, of so much fear, not of the question, but of the answer: How much loneliness can someone take, how much of it, when is so much that one just settles, when is so much that the only thought is just finding someone to settle with?  Is not much of aching for someone as much of you would thing... This has nothing to do with Nathaneil, Adrian, Charly, etcetera, etcetera ( well, not that much "etceteras" ... LOL ) nor does it have to do with Valentine's day. Is not the season, is not the weekend either. Is just a constant feeling, a thought in the back of my mind, a little hammer that keeps hitting, hitting and hitting. I mean, how much can you endure? How much can you yearn? How much can you take? At the end I just hope I will be able to learn and grow stronger. Is it too much to ask?  I just want to find someone that can say to me that he will wipe away my tears, he will be there to hug me when I get cold, he will care... he will care. Anyway, how pathetic can I get? Do I need to start listening to Evanescence, Sarah, Vonda, Eddie Vedder, Jeffrey Gaines and Jay Jay Johanson for you to understand how cliché I am?

        Ella Wheeler Wilcox        Daily Horoscope for Capricorn - 03/16/04 by  urlLink Kelly Fox Extended Horoscope     Dress for success, because today could be the day. You're tired of leaving well enough alone. If it's good for you, you'll welcome it into your life with open arms. Forget about what everyone else says is impossible. Upward mobility isn't a myth to the people who have earned it. You can see your way up the next few steps of the ladder. Grab on and start climbing. And even though changes made at this time are likely to be permanent, you don't need to look back. You're not one to miss scenery that was getting old.       ....   I've read a lot of profiles, a lot. The one I'm posting is actually in the same page as the horoscope above, so if you want to check yours go ahead and click the link above, its by Kelly Fox on  urlLink Astrology.com . Now, this "karma profile" is totally me... check it out:      Capricorn is the worker bee of the Zodiac. It has long-term goals in mind and works toward them constantly, sometimes to the exclusion of all else. This Sign may be the most determined and ambitious of the Zodiac; as a Cardinal Earth Sign, Capricorn combines the benefits of a grounded stability with a sense of initiative and ambition to work its way steadily toward the top. The trouble is, in the process this Sign may neglect other important life pursuits such as family, relaxation, fun ... Also, this drive to reach the top may be something of an empty pursuit, since "the top" often means simply the height of public recognition. Status and recognition, in themselves, aren't reason enough to do anything; Capricorn may lack a sense of humility or of the importance of contributing to the greater good rather than to one's own resume.  Capricorns make great students and employees; their commitment to perfection ensures they'll never turn in a sloppy report. This points to another of this Sign's weaknesses, however: Its perfectionism means Capricorn is afraid to make even the smallest of mistakes. As ruled by Saturn, the Planet of Karma, Capricorn is imbued with an undue sense of responsibility and tends to be sober and earnest as a result. To many Capricorns, there's no such thing as "one little mistake"; that mistake is the very one, in their minds, that could throw things off further down the line, ruining that grand plan they've been working toward since the very beginning. This mindset produces far too much stress; Capricorn must learn to lighten up, even if only for the sake of mental health.  This same mindset may also mean that Capricorn doesn't make such a great boss. The controlling urges that lead them to strive for perfect results from themselves allow them to expect no less from others. Behind closed doors, employees may call their Capricorn boss a slave-driver! This is that Saturn energy at work again; Saturn is sometimes called the taskmaster Planet, and Capricorn takes up where Saturn leaves off. Capricorns tend to think their way is the best way and have a hard time taking tips or directions from others. Capricorns make mistakes too, of course, and rather than making a big deal of it, Cap must learn simply to say "Oops!" and move on gracefully.  The worry that one mistake, no matter how minor, could throw things off in a major way gives Capricorn a rather fatalistic viewpoint. Rather than being unforgiving and inflexible, this Sign must learn to allow room for error. Part of the problem lies in being overly concerned with what others will think of them if their errors are made known. Capricorns must realize that others don't notice their "shortcomings" nearly as much as they do themselves; in fact, others may not consider making mistakes to be a shortcoming at all. If Capricorn can abandon the rigidity in this thinking, it will be freed to relax and do some truly inspired work.  Capricorn can look to Aries to learn how to move on quickly rather than deliberating or obsessively trying to attain perfection. Cancer can teach Capricorn about valuing family and the home over work and industry, and Libra can inspire Capricorn to maintain a balanced view of mistakes and, more importantly, that sweetness is a better way to get results than cracking the whip!       ....   And on the same note... Wow, how superstitious have I become... well, at least I believe this shows a little bit about me... Yeah right! Well, ok, it does. The next personal profile is the  sample  my date of birth gives, also by Kelly fox on the same place,  urlLink Astrology.com .      Birth Date and Time.... January 12, 1979 11:49 AM  Birth Location.............. Mexicali, Mexico   Sun Sign...................... Capricorn       Section 1: How You Approach Life and How You Appear To Others.  You have a sensible and realistic outlook on life and your two feet are always planted firmly on the ground (though you may, on occasion, have your head in the clouds). Others often see you as a rock of strength, solid, reliable, dependable, and constant. You are, in fact, amazingly consistent for you possess great powers of endurance and do not like to make changes or adjustments in your regular routine. You do things deliberately and methodically and do not easily accommodate the unexpected. Though you have a gentle, even soft, appearance, you are enormously strong-willed and stubborn. You go at your own pace and refuse to be rushed or pushed into anything before you feel sure about it. You can be coaxed and persuaded by charm, beauty, love, or affection - but never forced. You won't fight either, but simply stubbornly resist any attempt to coerce you to do something you do not want to do.   Section 2: The Inner You: Your Real Motivation.  Serious, disciplined, and quietly ambitious, you are driven to prove yourself and to achieve material accomplishments and success. Your work, your position in the world, and your contributions to society are very important to you. You will persevere through enormous hardship and frustration in order to reach a goal you have set for yourself, and you often sacrifice much in the area of personal relationships and home life in order to do so.      There you go... Just a peek at the inner me. Oh, it shows I have nothing to say or do at the moment. Wait! I have a test tomorrow, I'll star studying for it. Bye!

        Sy Parrish       While talking with Linda on the car, as we were moving to NAF El Centro to catch a glimpse of the "Blue Angels" I came clean with my feeling: I'm still in love, so is an endless mourn from here on. I still cringe when going to el Centro. As I pass places we shared and moments, that still are in my head come running fast; I get sad. Sad at the thought I did not see him on the street. Jolt at the sight of him, or someone that looks like. I keep going, not alone 'cause I know I'm too weak, just to feel the rush of seeing him. I remember one friday in December, as I was with my friend Rebeca, and we were going to the movies, happy as a clam. I came to a stop sign and turning my head to the car stopping on the opposite direction I saw him. Him in his car with his boyfriend. That sudden sense of joy and sour moment of lost, both wrap in an emotion I still can not name, is the proof I'm still breathing, that I love him.   I've never been too akin on talking of someone that makes me feel sad, not even when at the beginning of this Blog I saw Neil again. This late days have been the hardest, and I don't know why he keeps popping up on my head. Was it too intense for the time it lasted that it burned me so hard? I don't know. I just wish I could held him again. Now, I am not ashamed to say that I still love him, love him so hard that I could cry, won't, but could.   Linda, who's been in the same position as me, tells me she endure two years of pain, she stills feel sad at moments. So, at least I'm not alone on the way I love. Maybe I just need to get laid. LOL! Some times I get really scared of the way I feel, I have thought I might be bipolar... well, that's a way of blaming the feeling to something other than myself. Damn! I just want to kiss the bloke!      I'm with everyone and yet not  Got to get away from here  I miss the one that I love a lot  I miss the one that I love a lot.   Swallowed. Bush.

        Someone Like You        I know you think that I shouldn't still love you,  I'll tell you that.  But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it  where's the sense in that?   I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder  Or return to where we were   Well I will go down with this ship  And I won't put my hands up and surrender  There will be no white flag above my door  I'm in love and always will be   I know I left too much mess and  destruction to come back again  And I caused but nothing but trouble  I understand if you can't talk to me again  And if you live by the rules of "it's over"  then I'm sure that that makes sense   Well I will go down with this ship  And I won't put my hands up and surrender  There will be no white flag above my door  I'm in love and always will be   And when we meet  Which I'm sure we will  All that was then  Will be there still  I'll let it pass  And hold my tongue  And you will think  That I've moved on....   Well I will go down with this ship  And I won't put my hands up and surrender  There will be no white flag above my door  I'm in love and always will be   Well I will go down with this ship  And I won't put my hands up and surrender  There will be no white flag above my door  I'm in love and always will be   Well I will go down with this ship  And I won't put my hands up and surrender  There will be no white flag above my door  I'm in love and always will be   White Flag.

        Lawana Blackwell      A few days back I found a notebook, one that I used as a Journal. I've been reading it and is somewhat ... umh, well, not funny, but yes, a little bit interesting. I've been a lot busy this past weeks, and I like it. Anyway, I'm here to present you what I wrote a long time ago:    ....    September 21 - 2002 .    I'm alone at home at last. Finally, I have my Directv.  Being true with his feelings, Roger uses his journal to fill it with his deepest thoughts. But why in third person? Well, why not? Is a little change in his life.  Today was about his old hobby: the TV. He still thinks it wasn't cheap though. Naturally he's wasting precious time, there's a test next Monday and he's not prepared. He will have more free time tomorrow anyway. Today, is to be at home. This past days have been quiet, no excitement at all. As time passes and days fade is almost impossible to differentiate one day from other.  A relationship? non existent, but he does not feel alone. Thinks, knows he does not have someone to share everything with, he does not care for the moment though. School, TV and money is all there is in his head. His grades are good, almost excellent: 97.7 total. He's fourth or fifth in total grade at school level. He just hopes to keep it together.     ....    October 17 - 2002 .    Roger has been asking himself what's the point on having this journal if he does not write in it.  Well, at least it will be a register of how lame life is. A record that he at least keeps on walking and breathing, a record he's veins keep pumping blood without oxygen to his lungs.  Yesterday was the day of a glamorless event at school, in which the best students received some recognition: a diploma... It was weird moment, seeing people walking to the podium and accepting their recognition made him feel uneasy. Before him there were around 20 to 25 persons. There were all kind of reactions, the room was filled. There were the ones that were cheered, the ones that got an applause because two or three other persons knew them and there were the ones that no one cheered for them ( luckily those were never present ) all this made him feel a little bit worried. He thought no one would recognize him, no one will cheer for him. Filled with that, now classic, high school anxiety made him angry. Angry at how vulnerable he became, angry and tired that at this somewhat happy occasion he had to feel this uncomfortable. It was Linda's time to get her diploma... Do I need to say anything? ... Two more and it was his turn... His name was called. He froze, his heart pounding in his chest, but all this was just a moment, a second, because he was still standing from his chair when he heard that sound, cheers... classmates and friends... It was a perfect day.     ....    July 14 -2003     Time passes. Almost two years, and there have been two relationships, some social stress and a clear and marked slip in his grades... A clear sign he should not be in a relation when he's in school? Time will tell.  Months back, in the middle of October, He met someone he had not seen for a few years now: his friend Fernando. It was nice seeing the guy. He's traveled and lived in other countries. They exchange e-mails at the end.

        William James      Fast enough life passes. Sometimes I just seem to get caught in the rush. Going so fast, mindless. Is like running down a hill, so fast everything's a blur and at the end you just look out for a rock on the road, hoping not to fall. That's life. The rush of it seems to take its toll with time.  But we are so used to be this fast passed beings that slowing down is just out of the question, and if you tried to, nature won't allow it in an easy way. Be happy to have a family to lean on, friends that care.

        Peter Ustinov      Being in love with love, that's my curse. I believe in it. I need to believe in it. What's the point in living if there's not love involved?  Sitting in a cold afternoon, just a blanket on my legs, a cup of hot cocoa and my fav book on the side. I'm outside, under the pine trees of Vermont looking the sunset and the way the sun touches the great fall foliage. I keep staring at nothing, just calmed by the beauty of it all. A rush of wind makes music as it passes through pine needles. Is a chilly music, calming. I look by my side and there's the guy I'm in love with, sharing the moment and handing me a marshmallow. He leans to rest his head on my shoulder. Kiss his head, smell his hair. It's getting late. I'm in love! I'm being loved!   ....   At 32, Liam seems to be the perfect guy for me, at least on paper. Much is to do and say about my relationship with him. All I can say at the moment has to do with the way he makes me feel and the way he seems to respond. We are getting to know each other, in this almost two months dating, we had had some bumps in the road, but we try to drive around them with maturity, a thing that has been lacking in my previous relations. Is it perfect because he is older, wiser than me? Maybe not, and is not perfect at all; we started this in a slow and busy way, we were not deep in all of it, we didn't care for each other in that special way, and that's, maybe, the perfect way of being, the perfect way of starting, because there's no way to go from there but up. We'll see. Spending weekends with him in SD just made me realize how in tune he is with his emotions, how calm, how demure he is. I like that. Finally I'm dating not a guy, I'm dating a man. One that's a match intellectually and emotionally.

        Ayn Rand      As I get older, and older, and older... I tend to get more in touch with my opinions, opinions I don't share that easily. But there are moments that one needs to express oneself, not as a matter of political agenda, but as a matter of having one point of view on specific topics... The next one is an essay I handed as homework for one of my classes, is in Spanish 'cause I'm not in the mood to translate at the moment, latter I'll do that. Anyway, here it goes it's called "Spain, 11-M and more"     ....     España, 11-M y más.    Uno de los principales cambios que la elección de Zapatero, candidato triunfante del Partido Socialista Obrero Español, fuera de los claros cambios económicos internos y la tirante interacción de la que serán participes las distintas ideologías en el poder, será en lo tocante a las relaciones exteriores y la nueva visión internacional que el candidato ganador proyecta.  Zapatero no podrá ser investido presidente y formar Gobierno hasta después de Semana Santa, así, desde el 14 de marzo, el gobierno del Partido Popular que dirige José María Aznar no es representativo de la voluntad mayoritaria del pueblo español, voluntad expresada ampliamente en las urnas y es entonces en estos días que observaremos como Aznar actuará en lo que por derecho le queda como gobierno.  Por lo pronto, de acuerdo a El País, en su editorial del 22 de marzo, el gobierno español en funciones “...está dando signos preocupantes de no entender la situación...”  Por su parte, Zapatero anunció al día siguiente de su triunfo electoral que las tropas españolas desplegadas en Irak regresarían antes del 30 de Junio, promesa dada en campaña. Esto ustificándose en las mentiras otorgadas por Bush, expresando que la intervención militar ha sido un desastre y “...no se puede bombardear un pueblo por si acaso.”  1   Esto es un claro generador de conflictos tanto para las empresas españolas como para las empresas estadounidenses que operan en ese territorio. Es tanto el impacto que el nuevo presidente español ha causado, aun sin ser investido, que el día de su elección los mercados financieros bajaron 4.15%, cuando 3 días antes, el bombazo del 11 de marzo en Madrid, día nombrado por el parlamento europeo como el día contra el terrorismo, provocó tan solo una caída de 2.18%. Los compromisos obtenidos por el gobierno de Aznar con los Estados Unidos están en claro riesgo; de acuerdo a la Jornada en su sección de economía, “...todo indica que para los barones españoles del dinero y empresas que los acompañan sí hay un hecho más execrable que los aberrantes atentados del pasado jueves en contra de indefensos civiles madrileños: la victoria electoral de José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero y el Partido Socialista Obrero Español (PSOE).”  2   Zapatero menciona su triunfo como un claro efecto de las políticas de Aznar en relación al apoyo que este dio a Bush a pesar de la opinión popular española. Los atentados del 11 de marzo en Madrid, solo ayudaron a inclinar aun más las balanza, especialmente cuando la atribución del mismo desde los primeros momentos de calma, especialmente a nivel internacional, se le atribuía al grupo árabe Al-Qaeda, recordemos que fue un periódico inglés en idioma árabe el primero en atribuir el atentado a esta red. Sin embargo, el triunfo de Zapatero era poco pronosticable, antes del atentado, las encuestas de opinión parecían favorecer al candidato del Partido Popular. Desde el primer momento del ataque terrorista en Madrid que causó la muerte a 200 personas y más de 1.400 heridos, el gobierno adjudicó la acción al grupo armado vasco ETA, con lo cual pensó consolidar su posición en su rechazo a esa agrupación. Aznar, durante sus ocho años de gobierno, sobre todo en el segundo mandato, “...exhibió lo que llamaba logros en la lucha contra esa organización separatista, a la cual golpeó con la detención de varios de sus líderes.”  Pero tras atribuirse el atentado la red árabe Al-Qaeda, los españoles manifestaron su rechazo a la política del Partido Popular con un voto de castigo que dio la victoria a Rodríguez Zapatero.  Sin duda las elecciones españolas son la consecuencia de las políticas de Aznar hacia su relación con el exterior, principalmente con los Estados Unidos. Por un lado la presión de los poderes económicos españoles, principalmente los banqueros e industriales, y por el otro la opinión pública, a la cual Aznar prefirió ignorar. Aun cuando el cambio de partido es importante, no creo lo sea tanto como lo menciona Zapatero, capaz de incidir en los comicios de noviembre en los Estados Unidos. Recordemos, que si bien el retiro de las tropas españolas de Irak son un golpe al eje de apoyo de Estados Unidos, el candidato republicano y el presidente Bush, así como el electorado, tienen que resolver múltiples elementos de aspecto interno, principalmente lo relacionado con equidad social, además de sobrepasar la visión que cada norteamericano tiene sobre la que la situación en Irak es.

        Robert Frost      How different life can be when one's not the driving force of it. You just keep yourself busy with everyday minutiae. Going to school, those 15 minutes, are a high expectations event, is an endless music party filled with emotions. How pathetic is that? So, that's life, hence the title on the blog; at the end you just try to pass by life waiting not to numb yourself and hoping someone will grab our soul and pour in it emotions. Anyway, you keep coming and going on your life as days go by, one tries to keep oneself busy, and trying to reach our goals we bump into so many life events that are just too normal to care. Boredom. Despite it we need to continue to live, to charge at it with all we have, grab the bull by the horns and never stop to look back. Relay on family, friends and happiness of yore, waiting with excitement what will come never forgetting what has been done by us and to us. But all this is part of a process, a process called life as you grow.  And as you carry on with every burden and soulless task appointed to you ( ...and if you do not find a way... No one will!...LOL! ) all of a sudden life sends you a sign everything's going to change: not one, but two guys that show some interest in you. Now, not being abrupt to new situations I'll handle this in the most elegant and decent way. They both know about each other, we are just friends for now. Now, I seem to have my fav, not saying which one right now, I'll just say I've been spending too much time with people from San Diego.  Fingers crossed, nah! Everything seems going the way it should be.

        Michel de Montaigne       Memory. It's a roll of the dice. It's not up to us what event can linger in our head, what face and name should we connect with. As yesterday wrote about change, I got to think more about it at night. Memory does change. It does not go from 0 to 5... it fades, it moves, it lingers there in a subtle way, just waiting for something to wake it.  As in any blog, all comes to what we live. What we think. What we ache, cry for. What we cherish and loathe. Dreaming last night, I woke up with this feeling of loss. Neil's and Adrian's faces fade of my head. I am not being able to dream them. Lines and colors are gone, sensations are lost. I can't remember the feeling of their embrace, their mouths and warmth. This guys are the one that I cared for, the ones I loved, and ... still do... I woke up sad, lost. Their faces were a blur in my dream, a blur so painful, so sad. I want to remember, I don't want to lose them here [ in my head ] too. But "everything" changes. Memory fades.  Cry te lost but remember the good.    urlLink    ...&nbsp; urlLink

        Heraclitus      Well, change is on the air.  There's not much to say about this past days. Now I know my mind is not processing anything interesting lately. And just around me, everything changes. It may be natural, but it's not a comforting feeling. As I've said before:  "I'm a person of habit"  ...  Friends's over. Frasier's over. Liam's over. Relationships, feelings, memories, scents, lifestyles, everything evolves, everything ... changes. Everything but me.

        J.K. Rowling      Far better to be sure than to guess. That's what Liam felt, and that's the way he acted. Sad he did not make the best decision. Pity! But as before, I can not rule in my heart. It's independent and stupid. Been taken aback by his decision was something I did not expect, I saw it coming weeks before. This decision I thought was coming by my side. Nevertheless, waiting as I see now, was not his plan. I feel now we were not meant to be, we had too much in common, everything but love. We are friends, that I can say. We like each other. But at the end  he  wanted a partner, not a boyfriend. And at the moment I can not offer more. We had discussed the issue once and it was a heated argument.  Is somewhat strange. I've been aching for love. Someone gives it to me and I just turn around and don't look back. It was just a matter of time, I could have fall in love, but again, choices were made and none of them were good at the end; not the ones I made, not the ones he made. And as corny as it sounded, and as a rip off of S&C it may be, what he did say at the end is what I been feeling this whole time:  I need to be loved. Madly in love. "Cannot live without each other" love. Insane, dependent love. "Just a sight, and I loose my breath" love.   I'm sorry I did not deliver, I tried. But again, it is not to me to decide who am I gonna love. It just happens. And from here on, expectation! What a dread!

        Dante           Always thought your promise was for life  I did not think that I  Would hear you say good-bye  And I always heard you led another life  I doubted every time  I guess every time  Cause in my eyes  Love was always something magical  But the feeling is so tragic for  And all I know is in love  The thing that I want most  I can't possess  There's only emptiness   In the late of night  Just before I closed my eyes  You lied  As you kissed me goodnight  In the late of night  Just before I closed my eyes  I cried  As you kissed my lips good-bye   In my eyes  You will always be the lucky one  Cause you know you'll always have my love  For all time until I die  Through the end I gave to you my best  You gave, you gave me loneliness   In the late of night  Just before I closed my eyes  You lied  As you kissed me goodnight  In the late of night  Just before I closed my eyes  I cried  As you kissed my lips good-bye.   In the Late of Night. Tony Braxton.

        Javan      Sitting at home after a day's work for the last 4 days made me realize how much I miss him. How much I want to see him again. I thought I was mad at him, and that's why I kept thinking of him. Now I realize it was more than a yearning. I'm still in love. Yesterday as I got home, drunk and sad, I wrote him an e-mail. I wrote so many hurtful things for me. I even tried to ... I was sad. It was sad.   He's been coming to visit me [ as I've said before ] the past two Tuesdays. I went to bed on Monday feeling all around uneasy. At work on Tuesday, I kept looking at the clock. At four o'clock I sat in the living room and did not move from there all day... expectant... waiting... waiting for a moment that did not come! What was I thinking? That he'll be back? That he would embrace me again? Sad. Long and sad afternoon. So sad. So Long.   Why do I keep on loving so much? Is there a point? What I understand now is this: I can't keep hurting and bashing myself on the matter, I have to be clear and talk to him. Not looking an answer that I know will never come, I ... just ... I don't want the opportunity to pass. I'm in love. Still in love. I keep on loving you. I love you!    Adrian!      Yes indeed I’m alone again  And here comes emptiness crashing in  It’s either love or hate  I can’t find in between  Cause I’ve been with witches  And I have been with a queen   It wouldn’t have worked out any way  So now it’s just another lonely day  Further along we just may  But for now it’s just another lonely day   Wish there was something  I could say or do  I can resist anything  But temptation from you  But I’d rather walk alone  Than chase you around  I’d rather fall myself  Than let you drag me down   It wouldn’t have worked out any way  And now it’s just another lonely day  Further along we just may  But for now it’s just another lonely day   Yesterday seems like a life ago  Cause the one I love  Today I hardly know  You I held so close in my heart oh dear  Grow further from me  With every fallen tear   It wouldn’t have worked out any way  So now it’s just another lonely day  Further along we just may  But for now it’s just another lonely day   Another Lonely Day.

        Giacomo Puccini. La Boheme.       For whatever the reason and whatever the mood, I been absent of this blog for ages now. Sad is when there's so much to say, so much to live for, so much to share and no one to be there for you.   Well, I'm here again.   You know! Everything feels the same, the same boring and lifeless day. Though many things have changed and in many, many ways I'm not the same; at heart, my mind still lingers where it should not [ Adrian ].   Lost is Liam. Yesterday we had a conversation after three weeks without seeing each other and our relationship pop as a conversation theme. He made a bold move and asked me to be his boyfriend; and it seemed that the "partner" topic was left in the past. I kept eating my steak and did not answer.   Adrian has come to visit me two times now, once a week. The first time, first time since we left our business undone too, was a shock. My knees almost gave and my heart and speech were one of a 85 years old guy. At first I did not know how to react, how to behave, I tried to be as cool as possible. I tried. The second time around I had Liam on my head, and did not know what to do, our date was closer and closer and as he said [ Liam ] "we needed to talk". I was rude to Adrian, I was rude to Liam.   As conversation with Liam at dinner continued, with me still not answering, he told me to be calm and listen. Apparently, well, not "apparently", he was dating someone this last weeks, so was I. We were not exclusive and we were playing the field, as small as it may be for me. It did not work for him. As long as we were in our confession mode I told him about my visitor. Then something I did not see coming, happened. He stood up, went to the bar and spent a long time away. It all ended. He did not want to be there nor did I. It was goodbye.   Goodbye, there's a sad word. I hear it and breaks my heart. It takes love and takes it fast. At the end he told me he'll be there when I need him, no matter what; but it was time to move on. He kissed me and said Goodbye.   Che Gelida Manina. I listened to it when I realized Adrian was not who I thought he was. Che Gelida Manina. Liam and I listened to it the first time we spent the night together. How fucked up am I? So much that I just want to hear again:      Che gelida manina! Se la lasci riscaldar.  Cercar che giova? Al buio non si trova.  Ma per fortuna e una notte di luna,  e qui la luna l'abbiiamo vicina.  Aspetti, signorina, le diro con due parole chi son,  chi son, e che faccio, come vivo, Vuole?  Chi son? Chi son? Son un poeta.  Che cosa faccio? Scrivo. E come vivo? Vivo.  In poverta mia lieta scialo da gran signore  rimi ed inni d'amore.  Per sogni e per chimere e per castelli in aria  l'anima ho milionaria.  Talor del mio forziere ruban tutti  i gioielle due ladri: gli occhi belli.  V'entrar con voi pur ora ed i miei sogni usati,  ed i bei sogni miei tosto si dileguar!  Ma il furto non m'accora poiche,  poiche v'ha preso stanza la speranza.  Or che mi conoscete parlate voi.  Deh parlate. Chi siete? Vi piaccia dir?     La Boheme. Giacomo Puccini..

        William Cowper      School has been a hazard zone at the moment. People fighting over grades, other just arguing with the teacher and even some taking a wild side to their versions. Is not an easy mood. Some of us ( my classmates I mean ) have been there at school just because we have to show support and be sympathetic, but enough is enough!  In them lays the truth, they are the ones that never showed up to class, they did not present their essays on time, they failed the test, at the end they did not deliver. An example:  On may 24 we were told we had an exam ( by our teacher ) on may 27. Months earlier, we ( my team and I ) knew we had a presentation the same day on another subject. We talked with the first teacher and explained that if the exam was so everyone had another chance to pass, we had already a passing grade so another exam would lower our grade. He agreed with us and decided no to press the exam on us three ( my team ). So, we had our presentation and everything was ok. Sure enough, that same night the first teacher told us some classmates had got angry and decided that if WE were not doing the test, THEY should not do it either or else WE ALL should do it. At the end we HAD to do it. That same night, we had to study and present the exam next day in the afternoon.  Now is ok to defend your position. I'm OK with it, but only if there some basis to it. That people that got all mighty and righteous were flunking. My team and I were with more than passing grades, we were above the rest, we had 10's ( A+'s ). Surely at the end, most of them had to take a fourth test to pass and WE ( MT&I )were the only ones that had 10 again.  It's the same this time... I'm there just to support, but at the end the ones that flunk are the ones making all the noise.. all the crying...

        John Driden      Waking up, can you hear it? Is Charlotte Church singing "Just Wave Hello" from Danny Beckerman. As the music moves, you get up, stretch and clean your room. Happy Morning!   Take a shower. Shower at the rhythm of "Flower Duet" from Lakme, Leo Delibes' opera. Now is time to breakfast and as you seat alone, newspaper in hand eating and reading, Bach's "Prelude from Suite No. 1 for Solo Cello" is playing. There's no exterior sound but music. All calm, all quiet. Just a calming moment before rush hour.  In the car, ready to go to work. It's a 30 minutes commute. It's time to have fun. From home to the car and finally leaving the driveway you hear "Crane/"White Lightning" from The RZA/Charles Bernstein. Cool! Now you are in the highway, can you hear it, it's Al Hirt's "Green Hornet" ... just a funny, exciting sound. I think we are ready for a day's work, what do you think of Bach's "Suite for unaccompained Cello"?  Time to get back home. What about a some silky sounds? Just to relax you, like "Abel´s Harp", "Athena's Love", "Mime's Harp" or "Siren Sorrento", even "Poseidon", all from Saint Seiya.  It's late. Almost night. The sun is fading. Shadows make their way. Music starts as you put a leg out off the car: "Sonata for Cello and Piano" from Samuel Barber. It's kinda slow at first. The perfect sound for a tired person; just as you get home, it rushes it's tempo, the night is young. The night is romantic. The night could be sad.  Late in the night. You get all ready and let's be cliché by being serenade by Chopin with his "Nocturne." In bed. Ready to sleep or at least to try to, we hear a rendition of "Brahm's Lullaby" by Celine Dion. Close your eyes. Morning will bring new songs. New music. Maybe this time all will have lyrics!  Soundtracks... What will be of us without them?   By the way, this is what I am listening to at the moment:      WINAMP   playlist: 998 tracks in playlist, average track length: 3:52 Playlist length: 64 hours 25 minutes 33 seconds   Playlist files:   1. 3 Doors Down - Here Without You (3:58) 2. 3 Doors Down - This Time (5:18) 3. 3 Doors Down - When I'm Gone (4:11) 4.

        David T. Wolf      This is really funny. According to  urlLink I Village 's quizz  "Who's your Mr. Right?"  I'm 50% compatible to "The confident Champ." I know, I know, I Village is a girls site, but I bumped into the quizz and I was bored. Anyway, here's my "Ideal" mate:   You definitely know what you want -- a guy who's sure of himself. It's this self-assuredness that has gotten him where he wants to be. Perhaps he's at the top of the corporate ladder, the president of his condo board or the most sought-after when his friends need advice. What you gain in a relationship with this guy is a companion who knows most of the answers and will make you feel safe and cared for. As great as this type of support can be, the reality is that your ideas and his won't always mesh. And once you tell him your take on a situation, he may argue with you and try to get you to see things his way. Don't let this get you down or make you stop thinking for yourself. As long as you don't let his strong personality overpower you or take away your independence, you and Mr. Confident can make quite a pair. After all, a difference in opinions makes any relationship more interesting.

        Alexander Dumas      I've met this guy. Well, I did not met him, we knew each other for almost a year over the net. Now we started hanging out, or whatever the hell we were doing. So I met him on Saturday. I like him. He's nice.   Last Saturday night we were talking, and he commented something about this guy he was dating. I won't go into the gruesome details, I'll just said what today still lingers on me... He said that he did not like this guy, and as a matter of leading him into the truth, when he called him on the phone, he answered with words like "pal", "dude", etcetera.  But why do I mention this? 'Cause we've been talking for the last three days and suddendly, now I pick words from his conversation like "buddie", "bro" ... Am I reading too much into it? Maybe. Then again, maybe not.  I asked him out to the movies on Thursday; would have been this invitation three weeks ago, I think he would have said yes... Now, he just keep postponing. Man, How lucky am I?  But what to say about this guy? Mmmh! I want to find words that, well, safe ones. He's really nice, great smile [ Big, big teeth. I like that ]. I thought that by now I would've had an answer. *Sigh!  When my relationship with Adrian finished there were two guys that I felt were the real deal for me. Those two guys were cool and mannered. They felt real! I did not want to jinx a possible relation with one of them right away by dating them when I still had feelings for Adrian... or while it still hurts. In that intro, of months, I lost one by him moving away. And Victor [ the guy I'm talking about today ] got tired of trying to have a date and as result I lost contact with him for a good time. We reconnected in May, by a chance of the dice; I was Online and he popped on the messenger. We talked and he mentioned about me being a little too high maintenance and leading him to believe I was just not interested. We kept talking till we found ourselves saying good bye again but with a renewed friendship.  After a long hiatus, I found him again online last Saturday. I was ready to what he had to offer. We had a date that night. I won't talk about the details, I'll just say that what happend, what I heard while I was in bed [ and him on the sofa ] made me think, made me believe there was the chance of a relationship... Now, I just don't know. Well see.  He's funny, and Really smart. Still, a little bit younger... He'll be 22 this august. Well I like him. I know is too soon to be thinking about it. But I rather think it straight than just going with maybe's. Now, the big question is what does he think. Will he be ok dating me? Will he be prepared to a relationship? [ Oops! Relationship? Even I got scared of it! Yeah is too soon to be flaunting that word! ]. Seems I'll have to wait.  Wait and hope. Hope for the best .

        Anonymous           I know that when you look at me  There's so much that you just don't see  But if you would only take the time  I know in my heart you'd find  A girl who's scared sometimes  Who isn't always strong  Can't you see the hurt in me?  I feel so all alone   I wanna run to you  I wanna run to you  Won't you hold me in your arms  And keep me safe from harm  I wanna run to you  But if I come to you  Tell me, will you stay or will you run away?   Each day, each day I play the role  Of someone always in control  But at night I come home and turn the key  There's nobody there, no one cares for me  What's the sense of trying hard to find your dreams  Without someone to share it with  Tell me what does it mean?   I wanna run to you  I wanna run to you  Won't you hold me in your arms  And keep me safe from harm  I wanna run to you  But if I come to you  Tell me, will you stay or will you run away?   I need you here  I need you here to wipe away my tears  To kiss away my fears  If you only knew how much...  ...I wanna run to you  I wanna run to you  Won't you hold me in your arms  And keep me safe from harm  I wanna run to you  But if I come to you  Tell me, will you stay or will you run away?   Run To You. Whitney Houston.

        Hans Christian Andersen       Monday, July 12th in 2004 will be the day I experienced magic. The day will be known as:    The Day I met my Goddes .       urlLink     Sarah McLachlan&nbsp; urlLink         July 12 - 2004   6.00 am.     I woke up tired, but excited, Saturday and Sunday had too many emotions for me. Never the less today was the day. But what a day, It was Hot, extremely hot. I took a shower and got ready to hit the road. As I was loading the car, I remembered to call Linda. She was done and ready, just waiting for me to pick her up.      8.30 am.     The Highway. The plan? Get to San Diego, spend some time on Mission and Fashion Valley; go visit Alejandra at around four and finally Sarah's concert at eight. It was a nice trip. We were chatting and gossiping... Nothing new with us... Well! For you to find out.      9.30 am.     Mission. Damn! It was horrible... Hot, humid, did I mentioned hot? I almost die. I am ok with a hot day, but I hate to sweat. Anyway we got there and started looking around. Too many nice things, too many expensive things. It's really funny how much Linda and I are the same when it comes to shop. We look for clothes that are made for winter, and then, not buying much, we move to check Macy's and Robinsons' 3rd floor [ home ] and get really excited with bed sheets, knifes, rugs, etcetera. How gay am I?   Anyway, by 10.30 in the morning we were already tired and sleepy. We did not feel ok on how fresh and clean we were. But we still had a long day ahead of us.      12.30 pm.  &nbsp;   We decided to leave Mission and check out Fashion Valley. I don't know how the hell we endure the day. I don't like to get tanned, she does neither.   We looked almost every shop in FV, but it was heaven the moment we stopped at Macy's and the girl started to look for shoes... I just sat there thinking and resting. I don't know what happened then 'cause my mood went down the hill at that moment. Linda looked at me and sat next to me.  "What's going on?"  -she asked-  "Why the face? You look sad, ok, what's going on?"  I did not know what to say. I kinda knew what was going on... Anyway.      4.15 pm.     Now we were REALLY tired. Really, really tired. We got out of A&amp;F without buying a thing... Do I need a sweater at the moment? I think not... My throat hurted and we were hungry. Is at this point of remembering that I cringe. I remember muttering my discomfort and almost making way to the car and back home, WITHOUT seeing the Concert. Oh my God!  "Let's call Alejandra, I'm hungry"  -Linda said.  "Ok"  -I answered.    "Ring, ring"  .... ?   "Ring, ring"  .... ?   "Ring, ring"  .... ?   "There's no answer"  -Linda said.   "Let's go over there. Worse come to worse, she's not there and we have to make time till the concert"  -I said-  "Sigh!"    "Ok"  -Linda.      4.30 pm.      "Ding, Dong"  ........................................ silence!   "Ding, Dong"  ........................................ silence!   "Knock, Knock"  .................................... silence!   "Ding, Dong"  ........................................ silence!   "Ding; Knock, Knock; Dong"  ...... ........... silence!    "Did she knew we were coming? Did you call her?"  -Linda asked.   "Yeah, I called her last week."  -I answered-  "She must've leave with her husband to work. She might be here in a few minutes."  -I said.   "Let's go eat, I'm starving. We can come back latter!"  -she said.   "Ok. Just let me leave a message, in case she can join us!"  -I said.   So I wrote a message and as I was looking for a place to leave it, so the wind wouldn't blow it, I notices that the door was kinda loose. Linda was looking to the other side but she remembered something and turned and said " Maybe the door is open"  ... she grabbed the knob and pushed the door open... My heart sank!   There I was, knealing in front of the door and staring inside the apartment. There was nothing. It was empty. She moved and did not say a thing, and I was thirsty and hungry! Linda is more relaxed, she pointed the obvious:  "I knew this was not the building! It's the next!"       4.55 pm.      "Ding, Dong"  ........................................  "I thought you were not coming!"  -Alejandra said-  "It's late!"     Damn it was hot inside the apartment. I almost faint inside. Alejandra was all tanned and ready to leave for the pool.      urlLink     It was hot that day!&nbsp; urlLink       She made us something to eat and spent some quality time together. I kept looking [ according to Linda and Alex ] rather sad and depressed. I drank so much water that I gave the impresion of being hang over.      6.55 pm.  &nbsp;    "It may be time for us to leave"  -Linda said.

        Groucho Marx      5 months: around 150 days: 3600 hrs: 216000 min. More or less; I'm not a calculator or a calendar for that matter. What am I talking about? Christmas! Too soon? Maybe. But that beautiful feeling; those chilly mornings; the excruciating anticipation a week prior to the 24th; snuggly sweaters; soft and silky drinks; being buried in a pile of blankets and quilts in a cold, cloudless night; family; love; memories...  The best time of Year. This will be one of the greatest years for Xmas. I'm expecting a lot of memories, a lot of moments, a lot of love and family.  I remember as a child those Friday nights in winter, in bed; my brother; a cup of hot cocoa with rainbow marshmallows; a hot plate of Campbell's chicken and rice, and a sandwich; watching The dukes of Hazzard and at the end the classical "Friday night, movie presentation", of which I never saw the end 'cause I usually fell asleep. Those were the days!  Now thanks to DVD, I'll get my "The Dukes of Hazzard: the complete first season" and remember those days... Xmas, what a feeling!    urlLink    ...&nbsp; urlLink

        William Knudsen      There's nothing more pretty than not having to rush into your e-mail account just hoping not to have it full. The new movement that Gmail started pushed Yahoo Mail! and then MNS to improve their mail storage. Now I have almost 2G storage if I add all my accounts. The rush will be "finding a way to use all that storage" ... Will be this the time to start embracing Bulk mail? Mmmm, ha, yeah right!
