						   I just received a bit of spam that began with that question. One would think such a question would be followed by statements about how disgusting and degrating such behavior is both to you and the person you're doing it to. But no--it was followed by resources for how to further engage in it. Revel in it. Enjoy it. Find others to degrade and dehumanize who are willing to be treated in such ways. This brought to my mind some bits of commentary I'd like to share.   "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor." This commandment of the ten given to Moses on Mount Sinai has been taken (rightly or wrongly) by Christians through the years to mean don't lie. In Bible classes and among close friends people talk about the ramifications of lying: loss of trust, a breakdown in relationships, feelings of shame and guilt, separation from God, etc. Even in the "secular" world, truthfulness is upheld as of extreme importance (at least in personal relationships). The consequences of lying are well known and are to be avoided. Part of what happens when we lie to each other is dehumanization. We have decided that our pride is to be more highly regarded than the humanity and right-knowledge of the other person. That is wrong. Even popular movies frequently uphold this value.  To treat another person like a toy is another form of degradation and dehumanization, and yet THIS is perceived as more acceptable. One must only watch any "reality TV" show to prove this point. Girls compete for a guy's affection (or at least sexual attraction) in hopes that he's rich and she'll get to spend his money on herself. America sits glued to the television watching as these girls stab each other in the back and the guy strings them along through his position of power.   Should I be surprised that I would receive spam that advertises resources for treating people like objects? No, I suppose not. And yet it saddens me. How many people respond to these kinds of messages? How many people allow themselves to be treated like a toy because they are lonely and feel worthless? We murder each other through this kind of interaction. The true person is shoved below the surface so the body can be used or so our own selfish desires may be fulfilled without a thought beyond the self. So often it is the commandment against murder that is discussed as the worst rule to break. Yet we commit murder every day in more metaphorical ways, killing personalities to suit ourselves.   I would love to see the day when questions like the one that began the spam I received today would be answered with regret and a desire never to do it again. Such a day would see each of us being just a little more human.

      Got up and putzed around for a bit. Went to yoga at 10:30. It was a good stretching and breathing class. I think I needed that after working out my poor outta shape and now sore body. Came home and took a shower and took my sister shopping to prepare for Kings Kamp. She decided to decorate her cabin in a "Grease" theme. We went to Bonnie's in Ventura and got a bunch of 50s Rock & Roll decorations (inflatable guitars, an inflatable microphone, two cardboard juke boxes, black musical notes, some old records, etc.). She got each of her girls a packet of jelly bracelets too. I was hoping that would help her room bond. :-)   Later in the afternoon I got a call from Jack from Conejo. He asked if I would like to work with the new ym from Culver Palms on the campfire devotionals every night at Teen Camp. I'm pretty excited about that. That's one of my favorite parts of camp.   This evening I met my roommates, Chris and his wife Amy, and Amy's friend Elsa at B.J.'s for dinner. It was nice. Came home and got ready to see the midnight showing of The Village. I called Edwards to double check everything--it would be awful to have a bunch of teenagers waiting at the theater at midnight only to find out it wasn't showing. Well, it's a good thing I did because it wasn't showing. In fact, it's not showing anywhere in Ventura County tonight. :-) C'est la vie. And now I can go to bed earlier. I was a little worried about lack of sleep as I headed into a double header of camps.

      Saying goodbye sucks. Tonight at church we had a going away party for the Gerards. I bawled. I made Laura bawl too. I don't want to do it again, so I won't say much. But I will miss that family tremendously. They added so much to our congregation. I don't see how my dad's gonna handle not having Forest around either.   K. Enough of that. Tears are already welling up. After church I went to Applebee's with the teens. Just sat and talked. I have no money so I couldn't get anything. I didn't really want anything anyway. Quite full. We decided we're gonna see the midnight showing of The Village tomorrow. I honestly feel too old to do it. :-) But it should be fun.   Gonna crash now. Might be going to the beach in the morning with Staci too. We shall see. Goodnight.

      Wow! I feel good! I decided to go take the low impact cardio class at noon today, kind of at the last minute. I thoroughly enjoyed the class and shall be sore for a few days since I'm so dang sporadic about working out. At the end of the class I was showing another member how not to roll off of her fitness ball (or whatever it's called) and the teacher started asking me about whether or not I'd be interested in teaching classes. How fun would that be?! I'd basically get paid to do what I'd be doing anyway. Not a bad deal. I will have scant income in September anyway and have been racking my brain for one-month employment. They would certify me and teach me how to teach and all that. How fun! Total Woman is also going to start offering a ballet toning class. THAT would be a blast!   Now I must wait to hear from the supervisor and get more details. We'll see what happens.

      See? I told you I'm not very good at keeping up communication. :-) So, anyway, here are the highlights:  Last Friday I went dancing with Kelsy, Staci, and Bob. Yes, ME...DANCING! And I actually did have fun. I usually get all irritated by stupid men and it ruins everything, but things worked out pretty well. We all kept a good lookout for each other and ran off the stupid men. The band was quite good.  Saturday Erin and I went to Long Beach for a Kings Kamp meeting. That night I worked on church stuff and read. Sunday I did the usual and then went to Golf N Stuff with the teens and some of their friends. I finished Taliesin Sunday night and literally bawled. It was an incredible book. It is so very well written.   Then Monday was more work and I donated blood. Didn't get so sick this time. My bro came and picked up the old table and chairs to clear out our dining room, which was really great! I stayed up late Monday working on a new website. It's now quite large. I fear I've put too many pictures on it. If you wanna visit it, go here: home.earthlink.net/~kdhiggins  This morning I got up and took a step class. I nearly passed out. I guess I wasn't ready to be so active after giving blood. Oops. :-) I scared a few people. I've felt pretty sick the rest of the day as a result. Tomorrow I should be fine. I've been able to work on various projects nonetheless.  I started the second book in the Pendragon series yesterday: Merlin. I'll probably read more of that tonight as I lie in bed.

      Got up and cleaned and did a little organizing today. Felt good. It was way overdue. Worked on some stuff at church, had dinner with the church fam at 6 and class at 7. This was followed by an elders/deacons/staff meeting at which I made a quick appearance. Then I met Michael and Bobby at Denny's. Wally showed up a bit later too. We stayed there until about 11:30. When I took Bobby home, he couldn't get in the house. He tried waking up his dad to no avail. He finally had to call his grandmother who brought over a key. Kinda funny. Got home and had to wait for my sheets to dry so I could make my bed. It's now about 1:30am. I am mostly disappointed about the time because I want to read more of Taliesin. I am thoroughly enjoying it--to the point that I'm thinking about it throughout the day. :-) Talk about a nerd!

      Celebrated my brother's birthday today, although it was 9 days ago. The rest of the family was on vacation while he stayed home for school. I printed out a bunch of info on automotive training for him, put it in a folder, and wrapped it in ribbon. :-) Also got him three car magazines (one collectors' edition) and a Jimmy Hendrix CD. The gift bag I got was pretty cool too: it was black and fuzzy with orange and red flames.   Not a terribly exciting day. I did work out for the first time in a while. Worked hard! Got some church stuff done and made copies of a billion pages of genealogy information I borrowed from Grandma Higgins. It was nice to be with my family for a bit tonight. I enjoyed playing ping pong with my bro.   Now for more of Taliesin! :-)

      Well, not quite how I wished to spend the majority of my day... Because of the vehicle fiasco on our return from the family vacation (tranny blew in Baker, CA), the rented Astro van had to be returned. I drove the van as my sister followed me in my car. I spent the 2 hours there on the phone and listening to Sean Hannity. :-) On the way back Erin and I found songs to sing to. We returned home a little after 5pm. It was not terribly enjoyable to spend yet another day on the road, but c'est la vie! The rest of the day I spent working on various church projects including putting together binders for missions info and making the Keynote file for Sunday morning's worship service. My brother came over to pick up the paperwork to be sent to Chrysler "Customer Care" (the quotation marks are purposeful) and we played a few rounds of Yahtzee. It was nice to spend a little time with him anyway, since he was not able to join us for the family vacation (summer school). Drank coffee not too long ago in hopes of getting rid of a caffeine-deprivation headache. We shall see if I can get to sleep. In the meantime, however, I shall enjoy reading Stephen R. Lawhead's TALIESIN.

      Most of the youth group went to Magic Mountain yesterday. Quite a fun day. Those who went were: David, Erin, Bobby, Brittany, Victoria, Elisa, Carol, and me. Elisa ended up being a last-minute addition, and I'm really glad she came. She seemed to have fun and I think it was nice for Victoria to have someone more her age. It was also great to have Carol there: another adult for me to talk to and to trust with caring for the teens. :-) Lee was camping with a friend, James couldn't go, and Michael started a new semester at Moorpark yesterday.   There's really not too much to say about the trip. Everything was pretty smooth and everyone seemed to have a good time. This event ends up being David's last big event with the youth group as a member. He leaves for college on the 25th. It will be hard to see him go, but I know he'll have a great time at Pepperdine.   I think I realized that I'm liking Disneyland better now, though. A lot of the rides knocked me around quite a bit and made my head hurt. I love the power of a roller coaster, but I don't enjoy headaches. Now that I'm passed my teenage years, though, I appreciate the creativity and overall atmosphere of Disneyland better. Funny. Growing up is a strange process.   Elisa was baptized on Sunday. I didn't get to mention that. I was so excited when I heard it, I nearly cried. Her mother said that she felt closer to God at Kings Kamp than she'd ever felt and wanted to get baptized. Her dad did it during worship. How wonderful to add another sister to the body of Christ!   Now I must prepare to go shopping with my mother. That is, I need to take a shower. :-)

      Wow am I tired! I returned today from the second camp experience in so many weeks. Teen Camp (July 30 - August 6) was awesome. It's always a great experience. I loved my cabin (girls 1). We had so much fun. There were also some pretty powerful evenings. Among the favorites for the teens was the stations of prayer. They went from place to place around the camp where a passage of scripture and a suggestion for related prayer were posted. I was impressed by how focused each group seemed to be.   I did get to do the devotionals at campfire every night. That was a very good experience for me. I ended up working with the youth minister from Glendale instead. It worked out well. August complimented me (which meant a LOT) and said I may end up with the job every year. :-) We shall see.   After a day and a half home to do laundry (which turned out to be a fiasco as I washed AND DRIED a pen) and enjoy the restful sleep my bed provides, Erin and I headed to Idyllwild to Kings Kamp. This one is for 4th through 8th grades. Erin had a cabin of 6th, 7th, and 8th grade girls. Totally wiped her out, but it seemed to be very good for her. I got to room with two other girls who were staff for the week. Audry and I had an especially good time and enjoyed our conversations with each other. I'll miss her. She was in charge of the music videos the cabins made all week. I helped with the twice daily recreation times (one for the boys, one for the girls). I think the hike was my favorite.   Yesterday during our carnival time it began to rain big drops with incredibly beautiful peals of thunder. I think that actually turned out well as the games were more toned down and everyone spent a lot of time carving soap and making lanyard keychains. Later that evening an artist came and created a very cool landscape chalk piece. Under the blacklight appeared a picture of the risen Jesus. Pretty cool. Then I helped clean up the camp until 1am and got up at 6.30am to shower and pack up. Now for the unpacking, laundry, and catch up.
