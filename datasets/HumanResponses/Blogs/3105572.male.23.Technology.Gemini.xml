      Today's Bible Study was on  Psalms 103:3-18 .   What a great passage . It is amazing how much god blesses us.  So when times get rough ... look for those blessings in disguise.  They are always there! If not now then in the past and future.  Praise God!

      What an amazing chapter of the bible.  Wouldn't it be something to see when the armies facing the Israelites ambushed themselves and then like madmen killed each other?  All The Israelites had to do was stand firm. God is great.  It would be nice if God would come out and talk to us, telling us exactly what to do.  Unfortunately, people still wouldn't listen.  Don't you think that if God was talking directly to his people that they would listen and not do the stupid stuff like sex shrines and all that babble? I've never seen the writing on the wall or the signs and wonders.  I've never heard the calling.  But somehow I know God is there.  I know he is watching over me and taking care of me.  I think that I know I am in God's Will when things are happening that are for the good of God's kingdom. It's just like when I went to my last church.  I knew that I was where God wanted me to be because I got involved in the music ministry.  Everywhere I've went it has seems as if God has sent me there, even though he didn't give me a vision or write a message on the wall or anything.  For Now I'll just keep on Trusting. Keep on believing that God has put me where he wants me and that I'm going to do good for him whereever it is that he puts me.  Pray.

      My Bible Study today was on  2 Chron. 20:12 .  The Main idea is that no matter what we are facing God is the victor of all our battles. The Battle is the Lord's.  Just like when Israel was facing an army more than double their size. They cried out to God for help and what did he say but "Do Not Fear, The Battle is Mine!"  I Think that if we learn to put more of our faith in Christ and call out to him when we are in need that God will be there in a flash.   Amen!

      Yesterday I didn't do a bible study because it was my first day at my Internship at Argonne. I can't begin to tell you how much a blessing this intership is. The internship has to do with something that's right up my line of work. God Has truly blessed me.

       Today's Bible Study was on  Psalm 34:18  -- The main idea is that no matter what is happening in our life, good or bad, God is there.  All we have to do is call upon him and ask for his help and be patient when it doesn't come in supper fast.    Isn't it great that God is always there for us?  I think it is!!!

       Today's Bible Study was on  James 1:12-13  The main idea was that God doesn't tempt us ... it is Satan.  God only gives the OK for him to do so.  He does this so we can grow stronger in our faith and become mature christians.

      Today's bible study was on  Mathew 5:3 .  The main idea was to put yourself down in order to raise God up in your life.  When you are down it is God's turn to work in your life.  Be humble and let god do the living for you.

       Today my first bible study was on  Proverbs 13:3 .  God wants us to watch our words.  Don't be to fast to speak and let the spirit guide our tongues.  I know I need to work on this a lot.  God also does not want us to lie.  Well, that's a given.  But I can't think how many times I tell a little lie or over compensate the truth or hide the truth.  I pray that I will have the strength to stop this and have the spirit watch over my life and keep me in constant reminder that I have to watch what I say.

       Today's Bible study was on  Hebrews 12:4-11  and I learned that God punishes his people because he's trying to be like a good parent that punishes his children because he want's what is best for the children.  I hope that when God punishes me he will knock me upside the head and tell me what it is he is punishing me so that I can change and become a better christian!   Let that be my prayer for the day

      Revelation 1:7 "Look, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; and all the peoples of the earth will mourn because of him. So shall it be! Amen."  This one's for all you who are having a bad day today. This is for all of you who woke up on the wrong side of the bed. This is for all of you who snapped at your mom or dad and feel really bad. This is for you who feel like you're always alone. This is for you who don't have a car so you have to take the bus or walk every morning. This is for you who came in late to work and had every one scream at you. This is for you who hate high school and homework. This is for you who are far away from home missing your family. This is for you who didn't make the honor roll. This is for you who don't feel listened to. This is for you who don't feel like you're taken seriously. This is for you who are struggling with your time with God. This is for you who no matter what, all you want to do is be like Jesus. Whenever stuff just doesn't go the way you would've liked, just remember, you're going to see Jesus face to face soon! Start praising Him and get out of that funk! "For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal," 2 Corinthians 4:17-18. So shall it be! I can hardly wait!

      "May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer." -  Psalm 19:14  Stop and think about this verse for a second. Is what you say, think, and do in your every day life pleasing to God? That is one thing that should ring true in our minds and hearts each and every day. We should be living a life that is pleasing to God. Think about it like this: If you were walking around at school/work and Jesus was next to you, would He be pleased with you? If you would do things differently when He's there, I want to remind you of something: He is always there. If you are a Christian, He is with you always. And the only way to learn what is pleasing to God is getting to know Him and spending time with Him daily. I would challenge you to get into the word every day so that you can know what is pleasing to the Lord and will be able to start living it out. Don't put it off any longer, start today.  God Really Touched my heart with that bible study and thought that whoever is reading this might benefit from it.

      Today's Bible Study was on  Mark 3:3-6 .  It's ok to get angry or frustrated about stuff ... God did.  It's just what you do with it.  It's how you choose to deal with anger that makes all the difference.  So next time you get really angry will you punch the wall, yell at someone or something, possibly swear, or will you try your hardest to cool down and make the best out of a bad situation.  Always look for the path that Jesus would take.  When he got mad at the Pharasies in this passage ... he healed someone ... he didn't hurt anyone.  We should try to do the same.

      Today's Bible Study was on  Psalms 46:1 .  The main idea is that we have to get out and do ... sorta like ... goto the gym every now and again.  It's important that we practice and train our faith.  But, when times get rough ... and they will ... we can't stop ... we have to rely on god as ... sorta like ... our spotter. So get out and witness to someone today! (Hmm I suppose that means me to right?)

      Today's bible study was on  Luke 9:30-35 . When the disciples were on the mountaintop they had a "spiritual high", or "mountaintop experience".  Don't you wish life was full of those!  I remember going to youth camps and conventions and stuff, and now even the Promise Keepers meetings.  It's nice to have those spiritual highs so that we can grow in Christ. However, we need to step off of the mountain to witness to others.  So, don't always be looking for those moments in worship services and the such because they are just that,  Moments.  They don't happen every time.  We have to focus on the real goal of witnessing.

      Today's Bible Study was on  1 Corinthians 3:10 .  It's too bad that being a christian isn't all fun and games.  I mean ... God knows what we need and what we don't; however, we think we know what we need and we think we don't need God's help in deciding what that is.   God says in this passage that he wants us to be expert builders.  However, expert builders haveto work long, hard hours and often get frustrated.  We don't want to do the work that God has given us because we have our own agendas.   I think it all comes down to prayer.  When we are following God's plan for our lives and not our own God will not always make it easy on us, but he always knows what we can and can't handle.  When these frustrating times come along remember that God is making us expert builders, pray and good things will come out of it.

      Today's Bible Study was on  Psalm 56:8,10 .  I don't think I can say it better than the author so here it is ...  Psalm 56:8,10 "You have seen me tossing and turning through the night. You have collected all my tears and preserved them in your bottle! You have recorded every one in your book. I am trusting God - oh, praise his promises!"  Satan knows how important and special you are to God. He has always tried to kill the youth. Remember after Jesus was born how he tried to kill all the boys two years and younger through King Herod? He is still at it today, through abortion, drugs, suicide, abuse, eating disorders and alcohol just to name a few. One of his great lies is to make you think that you are the only one going through the problems and no one would understand or he tries to make you think that people would think that you are a bad person. Never think for one minute that whatever it is that you are going through that people do not care or that there is no hope for you. Psalm 9:9,10 says "All who are oppressed may come to Him. He is a refuge for them in their times of trouble. All those who know your mercy, Lord, will count on you for help. For you have never yet forsaken those who trust in you."  I hope everyone is listening to this because ... It's darn important to realize!!! If you are struggling with these kinds of problems PLEASE e-mail me or go to a christian counselor such as your pastor.  There is an excellent resource for Teens that are hurting at  urlLink Teen Hope Line .  I encourage you to visit if you are having problems (any kind).

      This morning my Bible Study was on  James 1:5 .  I am probably guilty of this here.  I don't always want to ask God what he wants for me because I have things that I want for myself.  Sometimes it is hard to tell if what I am doing is what God wants me to be doing.  I figure I know that I am where God wants me to be if what is happening is "good for the kingdom."  Ok, what I mean is something like this.  A few years ago I went to a new church.  I wasn't sure if this was the church that God wanted me at.  After about 2 or 3 months at the church I became involved in their music ministry.  God spoke to me through this and to others using me and the talents that he had given me.  I think that that is a pretty good indication that God wanted me to go to that church. I pray that I will pray more often asking God to tell me what it is he wants me to do. And, then when he answers me I pray that I have the strength to do whatever it is me wants me to do.  So many times I pray thanking God for what he has done in my life, but all to often I forget to ask him if this is really where he wants me, or if this what he really has in store me.

      Today's Bible Study was on  Romans 13 .  The basic idea is that you should love people.  If some one is hurting you, they don't love you!  I hear so many stories of teens that are hurting and being hurt by someone they Love.  They always tell me the line that the person that is hurting them loves them too but I'm here to tell you ..  IT'S JUST NOT TRUE!!!  I pray that these kids will someday see that love is patient and kind and all the 2 Corinthians stuff.  If you can't put the person's name in for love in that verse then you need to stop and take a look at what is really going on!

      Today's Bible Study was on  Matt. 12:43-44 .  We have to constantly be in God's word filling up the holes in our life.  This way the devil doesn't move into the places where we have a  VANCANT  sign up. Pray that God gaurds our bodies ... our temples.  Read God's word and follow his teachings so that we don't fall into the worng hands.

      Ephesians 4:27  "And do not give the devil a foothold."  Have you ever lied or done something and after you did, you felt horrible? Even to the point where you felt bad about yourself? When you start to down yourself and who you are, that is the devil lying to you. No matter what you do, nothing can separate you from the love of God (Romans 8:38-39). Hold tight to that truth and promise that God gives us. Think about your life and the things that you are holding onto that are lies about who you are. Those are places that the devil already has you. If you pray and ask God to free you of them and really believe that He will free you, you will be freed. Try to find someone that you can talk to about what you are dealing with. Anytime we bring things out from within us, we feel released of the burden it has on our lives. Take time today to pray and ask God to reveal to you what the devil has a hold of in your life. Then bring someone in your life to help you walk through those footholds.

      Isaiah 59:1 "Surely the arm of the Lord is not to short to save, nor his ear to dull to hear."  This is such an awesome verse. It's so easy to think sometimes that we're beyond hope, or that God doesn't hear our prayers. The truth though is that no matter how much we sin and how short we fall of God's glory, he is always standing by ready to forgive and accept us back There is nothing we could ever do that is so bad that God would not be able to forgive us. He loved us so much, that he sent his one and only son to pay the price once and for all. Even if you were the only one alive, Jesus still would have died on the cross for you. Jesus said that no man has a greater love than this: that he lay down his life for his friend. That's exactly what Jesus did for us when he died on the cross. Most of us will probably never have to sacrifice our lives, but we must be willing to sacrifice our way of life. When we become a Christian, we must put our old ways to death and daily take up our cross and follow Jesus. I encourage everyone to daily seek God and to do everything for his glory.
