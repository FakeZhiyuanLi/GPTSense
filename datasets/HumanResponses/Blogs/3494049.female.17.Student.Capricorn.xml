         I had to re-blog everything from today onwards as I've deleted my messy version of the first blog. A real mess indeed.. Hope that this edition will be better and more informative.. Support my blogging by giving feedbacks and comments.. Good or bad.. All welcomed! *Smile*      Tues 1:42Am        Made a new format for blogging and also to introduce this 2nd edition to all my friends around..     Going to approach my O levels Coursework B for Food & Nutrition.. Scare? Nervous? Neither..       Actually i wrote all these for about half an hour and now it's all gone.. My computer hanged!!!!!     Now I forgot what i wanted to say.. *Erm...*     I've so many concerts and performances during the weekends until I am so tired on the first day of the week. For more informations refer to the end of this blog if you are interested to know whatever events that passed.     Went to Band Fiesta II with Angerline, Huiyi, Azri. Ashela and J.R. Sandy. After that we went for 2 games of bowling. Pins unhit will have to be doubled and a choice of situps or pushups.. We sure had a great workout! Guess Who's the champion?? ME!!! Thanks to my 8 ball! Reach home at about 12 midnight. Sure enjoyed myself alot as I didn't expect Angerline and Huiyi to ask me along.. P.S.: Maybe it's because they do not know how to travel to the Botanic Garden... :x     More updates of concerts and performances will be post here.. Keep an outlook!!! [@@]v     Had more then 5 blisters of all shapes on my feet!!! Thanks to my new sliver shoe.. Wore my younger brother's big slippers to school as my slippers are too pinkish and flowery.. *Cutez*     Made Darren angry today.. He told me to go to a doctor but i refuse to and demand to hang up the phone.. Am i mean? It's normal for me to be mildly sick for a while as I am weak.. Sorry to have made you worried.. I am fine!!! *BIG Smile!!!*     I wanted to join Mus'Art Symphony.. But this year's my O levels.. Joey wanted to quit it and i am thinking of being a part of them.. What can i do? Tell me.. What can i say...     Science notes for my student undone.. Tired.. Reach home at about 12 midnight almost everyday..     I attended many beauty courses and it made me so vain!!! Although i know the tactics to make up, I dont need it!!! I admit i do put on make ups sometimes.. Not always.. Being a model is never what i dreamt of.. Many people aim to be models, but they didn't manage to be one. I am one here but complaining and whinning all the way. How ungrateful I am! kekE..

A total of 3 hours full concentration on F&amp;N.. It's our Coursework B Planning day.. Everyone was nervous and questions flew all over the computer lab and confusions floating around. Control? Variations? Measurement? Weighting Scale? The room is filled with tension and queries. My teacher Mrs Stella Goh did not report to school yesterday and therefore we are not able to ask questions yesterday during our GOAL sessions, which is from 2:15pm to about 4pm, and also missed one practical hands-on session on pastry making. As for myself.. Not quite nervous nor panicky.. As usual the calm soul of the class updating her blog when the teacher is talking and discussing about the up coming task that Cambridge is going to release. We knew that it was on fats.. However, everyone was unsure about what to use, what to do, what to write. 80g? 60g? Which? For my group we've done for the 80g self-raising flour. Indeed we had a great meal that afternoon though. There are so many factors to consider and everyone was memorizing what to type later on in WGS's computer lab on level 4. I am going to use the Ohaus Ruby 2500, capacity 2.5kg, deviation 1g electronic weighting scale. Everyone's snatching to raise hands for good quality glass bowls and weightning scales.. Haiz.. Chill man..    Have to stay in to do the Coursework until 4:30pm. I am craving for a bowl of pipping hot soup duck noodles from Vista Point.. Yum!    Have to rush home to complete typing science notes for mjy student, Lester, who is siting for PSLE this year. Quite stressful to teach him as wages are low and hours are long. Imagine 24 hours for only $50? Poor Me..    Darren said that he will not leave me.. How sweet he was.. He didn't reply yesterday as he was too tired to even reply to me.. Guys are all like this.. Furiouz wanted to call me this morning at about 3am. However i needed sleep so badly that i rejected. He too wanted me to be his girlfriend. What happen to all the guys nowadays? They like me but I rejected almost all of them. Am I too mean to treat them like that? Too selfish? I want someone who loves me and is of cause a gentleman please.. I'm not sure if they would change for me.. I won't want to love or like a fake personality person. I am in delima..    Is Darren really going for the cane tomorrow? Abit worried.. Small case led to suspension and also canning. What has this world decreased to? In-Human society? Schools get small reasons to whack pupils butts.. So small that it can be negligible.. Sadness..      Sign Off,     ·.×.·(¯`×-þ!ñKï-×´¯)·.×.·    Wed 4:57am     Although I don't like green, I'll still use it because my Baobei wanted green. BRIGHT green he said.     Went to ChinaBlack and back at about 3:45am. Baobei is so nice to send me home in his shimerring green evolution... *HugGieS*         Rushing my maths paper 1 now..     HEY!!! It's racial harmony day!!! Azni is so kind to lend me her P!NK Baju Kabaya. So i'm going to wear my 10cm heels and my doggy bag to school later on as its 2 hours before if i start counting now.. Late or early.. It's doesnt matter to a VAMP like me .. h4hA..     Heavy downpour made the night so humid and warm. Although not sweating, it doesnt feel cool at all.. This kind of weather is bad bad... with the fan on it will be too cold and without it is warm..     My bOibOi sent me his remix tracks.. He went to canada for a DJ course and now he is back to present his pieces to us! Overall for both the songs he did, they were good. Actually current I expecting the trend to be ending with an impact of three bass beat or more.. Many I should start the trend.. However, I was so tied up in school and work that i dont have extra time to do remix and compositions of songs.. Haiz!     bOiBoi changed.. He is not like the way "FuRioUz" is.. It's "IlluRiOuZ" now.. Not so gentleman anymore..     I am going to meet Azni to get my clothes soon at about 6:35am!!     For so many years, i havent had a chance to wear a Malay wear... Every year it was Chinese or Indian..       Sign Off,      ·.×.·(¯`×-þ!ñKï-×´¯)·.×.·     Thu 5:36pm     Just come back from Argro-Technology Farm and Qian Hu Fish farm! Actually i wanted to buy a blue lobster to rear.. It cost about $7 per lobster. Another one will be a red crawfish. They are so adorable! Swee Meng is so cute to tease me.. I commented on a very cute fish and i said "So cute hoh?!" He replied... "Just like you.." h4hA! Sarcastic man!     Bought a ready-to-serve salad bowl, which cost $2.30, and shared it with Nuriah! Yum! Together with a free LuttuCinno, which is a lettuce juice with kiwi and lime juice, and a box of butterhead luttuce for just $2. In store will be about $3+ then..     Reach home @ 5:15pm.     Am i going to have my greens for dinner tonight?       Sign off,       ·.×.·(¯`×-þ!ñKï-×´¯)·.×.·       Sun 12:16pm     Was out on Saturday until about 2am today. Slept till 10:30am and got up watching some cartoon with my youngest brother and come online to say hi to some of my friends.     Saturday shedule refer to the end of this blog.     Plan to go to Bugis later on.. Was quite lazy to do so..     My Mummy went down to buy food for me.. i wanted Lormee..       School @8am - 10am [ EL Mock Exam ]    Tanglewood Auditorium Concert @11am - 2pm [ Violin concerto ]    Marina Country Club @5pm - 1am [ Durian Galero, Swimming, K-box, Pool ]      Sign Off,    ·.×.·(¯`×-þ!ñKï-×´¯)·.×.·    Tues 2:10am      Going to have my O levels coursework B practical examination later at about 10:30am. So afraid that i might miss a step of the experiment or rather forget to bring any materials needed. Good Luck to me!       Just woke up not long ago.. about 12:30am I think..       Yesterday was fun.. Was on conference with FoRcEy, sCreWiE and NiLLy... They are all nice guys.. Very sweet! I promised to help do a sample for their tracks.. However it seems so difficult as i need to juggle lots of work in my life.. It might be quite a long time before they will get it.. I'm sorry..       Was so angry just now! Everyone was taking advantage of my knowledge and talents! I wonder why.. Am i good that they respect me and therefore wanted me to teach lots of things to them or is it I am too frail to say "no" and that's why they order me to do all sorts of things.. I don't mind if other idiotic people bullies me.. Not my friends please.. Olsen, my god-son, even have the cheek to have piano lessons outside and yet want to use my piano to practice and to complain to me about how bad his teachers are. The worst thing is he regard someone else that i don't really like, one who snatches my best friend and loves to be proud of herself when she is not even up to standard, as his another god-mother. I swear I'll disown him! Such a disapointment!       Went online kinda late today.. So everyone was asleep. Force and Nil had hit the sack long ago and Screwie had a bad headache.. But here I am chatting away with Hitawa Kor Kor.. Hitawa stays in Woodlands too! I think currently he has broken up with his girlfriend and feeling abit low.. LoveLess as he is.       All along I didn't realise that the song "Together again" by Sash! is partly in Danish. Nice track!       Should I post a picture ?

       Sun 10:42pm      Actually it's now the last day, last moment of week 4, 1st of August. However, I am wondering if my week should start on a Sunday or a Monday. Perhaps a Sunday..          I have tons of work to do.. Which of it I have done??     I met a mishap.. Terrible one.. I don't think it is convenient to announce here.. Sadedness..     For all last week's tests are all CANCELLED!!! Except for the History one. Although Mdm Salimah wasn't around then.. Everyone was obviously copying straight from the textbook as the dumb dumb teacher was just sitting there doing nothing staring at us..         Mon 12:05pm    Currently in school "trying" to plan for my coursework B when I suddenly want to create a wishlist for myself.. Here it goes..     New haircut!    Buy black nail polish!    Get at least 5/6 As for my O levels! *I-can-do-it!*    Slim down!    Complete make up class.. Note: Have been skipping a few lessons!    Prepare to save for Daddy's birthday present. He wants a BIG one!    Draw posters for my room.. Inspirational ones to motivate the lazy me!    Prepare my band for up coming SYF 2005! Turn the music up guys!!!    Replace contact lenses.. [@@-]v    Eat apple pie from MacDonald's everydayfor a week!!! = possible? Give me some hope!     Ok! I shall "try" my very very best to realise my achievements..    Looking forward to National Day!!! Lots of holidays!!!    Tues 6:18am    Yes it's 6+ am now! I woke up at about 5:35am to panick about my Food and Nutrition O level coursework B.. Such a hinder! Coursework B is such a tough task.. Nobody likes it.. Everyone is competing to get the best grades in class and here I am doing nothing but to ponder about it now and then. I really hated courseworks! I rather do theory paper and get an A for it..     Gotta report to school by 7:15am again.. Such a dread!     O level examinations at 10:40am until 12:40pm     Result photos not done yet!     Research and development not checked for error of imformation and grammatic errors!     *HungRy*     Gonna change into the dull and dumb school uniform soon which inculdes dressing up in P!nk accessories[-H4ha-], tying my hair and looking innocent, then off to school to sing the national anthem and take the pledge which I've taken for so many years and still taking.     Sunburnt cheeks not recovered. *Looks Like I'm Blushing All The Way..*      Hey! What on Earth happened? ALL BAD LUCK?!?!    Sign Off In Sadness..
