      .....Those who gave their all, some their lives for our freedom.  Just to think of the sacrfices people have made humbles me. Take a minute today to honor those who have given us our freedom. Walk up to a veteran and just say, "Thank You." The impact that could have is tremendous!  That reminds me of a story. My Grandfather is the state commander for the Disbaled American Veterans. He was shot out of a helicopter in the Korean War, and for him just getting around can be a daily struggle. 4 or 5 years ago we were in Pigeon Forge for the State Convention, and we had all gone to the "Dixie Stampede" for dinner. My grandfather had his DAV hat on, (Simialar to a Barret) and a little boy, he could not have been over 6 years old, walked up to my grandfather, gave him a hug, and said thank you. My Grandfather's eyes teared up. That's why he did what he did. He fought for our contry so that, that little boy could have a future, and that little boy realized that. It was so touching. So even if it is just a quick thank you. Let the men and women who have served this wonderful country of ours know how much you appreciate them. They will never forget it. I promise.  Ahhhh.... The weather last night was HORRIBLE. GP, Mom, Gene, and I ordered out from Chili's. We were just kinda hanging out, watching TV when the tornado sirens went off. You should have seen Me, Gene, and Shocker in the bathroom. Mom took pictures with her digital I will try to get them posted later on today. For those of you who don't know...Shocker is my baby! He is my (almost) two year old dalmatian.     urlLink    This is my baby! Isn't he the most adorable thing in the whole wide world?&nbsp; urlLink     The weather is much nicer today. We are having a BBQ, and I am going to eat SOOOO much! :-) Steak, Hamburgers, Smoked Sausage, Potatoe Salad, Cole Slaw, Watermelon..Mmmmmm. We should be taking some pics of that too, so you might just get a picture frenzy later.  Have a GREAT day!   "From the lakes of Minnesota, To the hills of Tennesee, Across the plains of Texas, From sea to shinging sea. From Detroit down to Houston, And New York to LA, Well there's pride in every American heart.And its time we stand and say, "That I'm proud to be an American, Where at least I know I'm free. And I won't forget the men who died, Who gave that right to me. And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today. Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land. God bless the USA!"

      ...For a little while. Promise.   I try to keep up on the news. Every now and then you run into some CRAZY stuff. I mean. I don't even understand why people publish some of these things. For instance:           Deer Breaks Into Minnesota Home    BROOKLYN PARK, Minn. (May 24) - At least the deer didn't act like a bull in a china shop. Vicki Mohler awoke Monday to the sound of breaking glass. She leaped out of bed and confirmed her two children were safe in their rooms, but she heard footsteps.  "Who's here?" she recalled screaming. "What do you want?"  When she followed the sounds of the intruder and peered into her basement, the sight brought both relief and shock: she saw the furry hind end of a deer.  She flung her side door wide open and called her husband at work."We have an emergency here!" she told him. "We have a deer - a deer! - in our house!"  Coming back to the side door, she saw a bit of blood outside and realized the deer had shown itself out.  Though the deer had leapt through a window and knocked over a lamp, it didn't disturb curio cabinets filled with dozens of fragile figurines in Mohler's living room. And it didn't seem to graze any items in the kitchen on its way to the basement, not even the refrigerator magnets arranged neatly in rows.  The family feels lucky. So should the deer.  Mohler's husband, Tim, is a hunter. He came home minutes after getting the call.  "If that deer was still here, we would have had venison for supper," he told her.

       ....Is a good thing?  Hmmm...according to this quiz it is. In case you can't tell, I get a kick out of this little on-line quiz thingys.  I'll try to cut back, I swear! :-)                    You have a twisted soul! Twisted Souls are never bad, and actually, are a rarity amongst souls. These souls are a little combination of everything, with always a little of their own chaos to add. Twisted Souls are kind, loving, weird, zany, temperamental, and very talented. They have their own firm opinion, and can at one time be very outspoken and passionate, and the other time shy and feeling insignificant. Twisted Souls have good senses of Humor and other times can be a bore. You can act quite intelligent at one time, and grasp concepts easily, while other times they can find it difficult to understand. Twisted Souls are always very fun and Kind, and can be party animals. But, if you love someone, youre serious about it, intense, and forever loyal.

      ....A big night out is always a little "blah". Last night was good though. Real good. When we first got to Vortex there was NO ONE there. We were sitting in my car debating on whether to even go in or if we should just go look for another venture. As we were debating on whether to move on, Depree called and asked if we were still going, so we decided to go ahead and go in. The population tripled in like the first 30 minutes we were there, and before you know it, it was crowded.  I saw tons of people that I know. I saw Fred and Jarvis, and Gene's friend from Mississippi College, Meredith. Depree got there about 30 minutes after we did and we hung  out basically all night. I could just see Meredith calling Gene and be like, "Gene, who is the guy Tiffany is hanging out with?" LOL  NEWSFLASH**** We are friends. Have been for like 4 years. We are both in long term relationships and are very much in love with our significant others. Now. I hope that nipped that in the bud. UGHHH!!! People piss me off, OK. Now I am done. :-)  I GOT HUNG UP ON!!! Yea. you read that right. I called Gene about 1am to see what he was up to. He said he was sitting at the Fraternity House. It was dead quiet. I asked him, "Is no one else there?" He was like nope.  Let's just say he was a tad bit intoxicated. I asked him what he had been up to, and made sure he was okay to drive. When I said, "I'll come get you if you need me to, because I am going to be worried about you until you make it home safely." He hung up on me. I tried to call him back...no answer. He called me when I was on my way home. I asked him why he hung up on me, and he said he didn't  remember hanging up. PUT THE BOTTLE DOWN!!!! Sheesh. I honestly don't think he had a very good time. I wish he would have just went ahead and went with us.  Oh well.   This evening, Gene is coming over and we are supposed to go to dinner and a movie, or watch a movie. We might just end up ordering out, depending on the whether or not the weather is cooperating.  It doesn't matter what we do, as long as we do it together. We have reached the point where we have just as much fun sitting at home watching re-runs as we do out and about. I love this man!!    You are a Fire Fairy. You are always fired up about something. You like to flirt and are very outgoing. Sometimes you get a little angry with people and want to do stuff that could get you in trouble. You are always up for a challange. You have many friends. You like to be up and about and be occupied all the time    urlLink   Which element fairy are you?

      Hello my faithful blog followers, Wait...are there any of those? It's about 9:30 and I am sitting around waiting on 11:00! I am ready to go out and have a good time. I need to get out, it was a rather long afternoon/evening.  Do any of you have a boyfriend's or girlfriend's friend that you just can't stand. I do. I wont mention any names for fear that it might incriminate me, but there is this one friend of Gene's that drives me up a wall. He is a total smart ass. I mean totally. The weird thing is, I can kinda tell when Gene has been hanging around him because all of a sudden...Guess who else is a smart ass?..... UGHHH ok. Random bitching for the day is over with... Back to tonight's plans.   I talked with Shalinda and she is not going make the trip tonight, she is kinda sick at her stomach.  I hope you feel better girlie.  Valerie and Jay(her brother) are meeting at my house at 11:00, and we are going to head to Vortex. Ia m going to assume Clarence is not going since I haven't heard from him. BUT Depree called me and said he was going to be down there. That'll be cool. I haven't seen him in FOREVER. And Val said Corea and a friend of his are going to meet us down there. I think Gene, Will, and Jason may end up there later on as well. I really don't care who goes as long as I get to dance the night away.   Tonight is the last night I will be going out with Valerie for a while.  She is moving back home to San Antonio. Her mom has breast cancer and she is having a hard time so Val is going home, and I understand completely.  I am just gonna miss her sooo much. In the year that she has been here we have gotten to be super close friends. Val, if you read this, I cherish our friendship more than you will ever know. I love you girlie. Ok... now it's time to party!   "It's nine o'clock on a Saturday, The regular crowd shuffles in. There's an old man sitting next to me, Makin' love to his tonic and gin. He says, "Son, can you play me a melody?, I'm not really sure how it goes. But it's sad and it's sweet,and I knew it complete, When I wore a younger man's clothes"

      To the weekend! Yesterday was good. I had lunch with Shalinda, went shopping with Valerie, and went out with Gene. Pretty action packed.  Last night we went to see "The Day After Tommorrow." It was a good movie, much better than I thought it would be after reading the reviews.  It really makes you stop and think about all the polution we are pouring into the enviroment. After the movie, we came back home and watched some TV, and spont some QT together.  This morning I went with Gene to get his oil changed, then he helped Grandpa dig a hole in the yard for the new flag he bought to put up.  Then we had lunch and he went home. :-( I hate when that happens.  Clarence got back home today!!! He will be home for the next year. He is like my best male friend (besides Gene) in the whole wide world. I am glad he is here. He just graduated from Diliard University in the N.O. and he came home for a breather.  Tonight Gene is going out with Will and Jason. I think they are planning to head to the bottom line and then maybe on to downtown, I am not sure.  "Whatever you do baby, be safe and have a good time! I will see ya tomorrow!"  On the other hand; Shalinda, Valerie, and I are going to head to Vortex. Shalinda's man is going out with his friends and Val is going back to San Antonio tommorrow, so we gotta have a good time. If Clarence gets settled in, he may go with us.   Well, I guess I am going to take a nap. Nothing better than a little shut-eye in the middle of the day. Especially on my new bed! Hope everyone is having a great weekend!!!

      It's Friday morning, I am off work. I am just sitting here eating breakfast and watching Ricki Lake. I love it! I am going to pick up my check and have lunch with Shalinda at 12, but until then....NOTHING!  We got a new computer last night, which always makes for an interesting situation. I lost all my documents, all my pictures, everything. But the speed makes it worth it, Doesn't it?  I have been waiting for Friday all week! I haven't seen Gene since Monday night and I think I am going through withdrawals (lol).  It's weird once you finally find someone who makes you totally happy, the times when you are apart drag by. It's horrible! But then when you are back in their arms it's all worth it.  It's just 10:00 can't get here fast enough.     You have a mysterious kiss.  Your partner never knows what you're going to come up with next; this creates great excitement and arousal never knowing what to expect.  And it's sure to end in a kiss as great as your mystery.    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     ""Cos it's the first long kiss on a second date.

      Hello America! What in the world is going on with you on this fine may afternoon. Let's see its about 4ish on Thursday and I am off until Monday! I am loving it!  Today was a VERY productive day at work. I had ALOT of new merchandise to place so it was busy, but it also made time fly by. Ya know, I was noticing as I was merchandising that there are some really cute clothes this summer...but there are also some hideous concutions. I mean, who would wear a 70's color suit with bubblegum pink pinstripes??? WHOA!  I have tons of things I should be doing right now, I should be working on Matt's Resume, I should be doing laundry, I should be cleaning out my closet, but NO! I am going to sit here, watch television and eat hot wings! That's all. Nothing else!  I got to talk to Gene for a few moments just now. He was on his way to his second job.  During the week we only get to see eachother once or twice, I hate that, by the time Friday comes around I am missing him like crazy! But thats ok, tomorrow night we are going to see, "The Day After Tomorrow" and heading to Beale Street for a while, and Sunday we will have dinner and maybe catch another movie or summin. Saturday I am planning on going out with the girls. I am not sure where that may lead us.   Oh No! It just hit me. There is nothing at all to watch on TV tonight...Oh no! I am in a reality show slump. I gotta check into this. lol.    "Have you ever reached your rainbow's end? Did you find your pot of gold? Ever catch a shooting star? Tell me how high did you soar? Ever felt like you were dreaming just to find out you were awake? And the magic that surrounds you can lift you up and guide you on your way!  I can see it in the stars across the sky, I dreamt a hundred-thousand dreams before now I finally realize, Ya see I have waited all my life for this moment to arrive..."

      ....The day we have all been waiting for, even if it has been for different reasons. Tonight is the finale' of American Idol. I have no idea who is going to win this year? I guess we will find out in about 2 hours! Speaking of Television... Did anyone else out there watch the season finale of "24" last night? What an ending! I think next to The OC, that was my favorite show of the season. LOL, I know it seems like I am some huge TV/Movie Buff because I talk about it alot, but I am not that bad, I swear!  Today was a rather unproductive day at work, which was exactly what I needed since, the week started off to be a huge mess. We had a visit with one of the company big-wigs and he seemed to be pleased with everything my team has accomplished. That makes me feel good. Even when the week goes wacky...that kinda made it worth it all, know what I mean?  I haven't got to talk to Gene much today, and I won't get to see him tonight either. Turns out his fraternity is having a rush event, so I guess it will be Friday before we get together. I miss him already! UGHHHH!!! He did call me when he was on the way to the hospital earlier. One of our friends, Eric is in there, with a staff infection. I hope he gets better soon. He is such a sweetie!   Why? Why is it that ex-boyfriends girlfriends always feel threatened by their ex-girlfriends? It's kinda sad, because you can't even remain friends with people you have dated because their current Significant Other has issues dealing with it. WHERE IS THE TRUST PEOPLE??? Oh well! That's my random thought for the day.   Oh... I almost forgot (man this blog post is all over the place) My friend Valerie is moving back to San Antonio the end of the week. I am going to miss her like crazy! Her Mom has Breast Cancer and is really sick, so I understand COMPETELY why she has to leave. I hope everything works out for you girlie!    "I was so high I did not recognize the fire burning in her eyes, the chaos that controlled my mind. Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane, never to return again, always in my heart....OH! This love has taken it's toll on me...."         urlLink What Classic Movie Are You?    urlLink personality tests by similarminds.com

      I will give you a hint. It's Tuesday night. There are only two contestants left. Diana is singing a gorgeous song right now written by former contestant Tamyra Gray. Give up? AMERICAN IDOL. See, if you paid attention to my posts from yesterday you woulda known that! I really like Fantasia, but something about Diana has me hooked. I will be happy with whichever one wins. What about you? Who are you voting for tonight? Or are you voting at all?  I just made it in from work. As you can tell by my "lunch-time" post it was a rather long day.  BUT... I am off. I am home. It is over. And I am going to have a calm, relaxing night. I am going to watch AI, 24(the final episode of the season), and sleep. Gene is going to be working out tonight, so I won't see him, :-( But I guess that could be a good thing, I might actually get a full night's sleep. (Although I would much rather be up with him.)   RECAP: I saw a few movies this weekend. I saw Shrek 2 and Van Helsing. Shrek 2 was good, but it was not AS GOOD as the first one. The donkey still is my favorite character. Van Helsing was awesome! It was a suspense filled movie that kept you holding on to the edge of you seats. I would reccommend it highly. This Friday we are supposed to be going to see The Day After Tommorrow. It looks like it may be the best movie of the year. This has been a good year for movies. Whats your favorite?  Ok.... so now it's back to idol. Have a GREAT night!

      Ok, Ok, I know I said I was not going to complain.  But... I can't help it! Everything at work is all messed up. I just wanna cry...Really REALLY loud! "Ah! Somebody help!" Our equipment is still down at work, which was not good yesterday, but it is really REALLY not good today because we have a major price change due at 5 pm! And... it seems to be all my fault. I guess I built the freaking sign printer..oh wait, even better I went back there and broke it on purpose! UGHHHHHH!!!! ok. I feel better now. Sorry guys!  My day did get a little better when I got in my car to come home for lunch. I was away from THAT place! And I got to talk to Gene, which put a rather large smile across my face! He has had a hectic day too... I guess it just isn't our day.  On a serious note, I am really considering looking elsewhere for employment. I hate having a job that I don't want to go to.  I think my problem is that I got spoiled when I worked at Stream. I loved that job and the money was great. And now I am going to the plantation, doing slave work, for crumbs! Life is a beautiful thing! Well guys, it's been a good lunch, but now it is back to hell! I hope everyone is having a GREAT Tuesday!   "...Except for Monday which was never good anyway, Tuesday I get a little sideways, Wednesday, I feel better just for spite, Thursday and Friday take two long, before I know it Saturday's gone, but it's Sunday now and you can bet that I'm alright."

      Well, it is 11:56 p.m. and Gene just left. We had a short but sweet visit. It was SOOO funny. Gene was standing at my bedroom door and Shocker was in the room with me, Gene would push the door open and Shocker would push it shut in his face, this happened over and over until Gene finally just came in and sat down. I couldn't stop laughing. It's moments like those that make life worth living.  We didn't even wacth wrestling, we just hung out and laughed. Thats one thing about our relationship, it hasn't always been a bed of roses...(no relationship ever is), but it has always been fun.   He left a little bit earlier that usual, so he could go work out. He is trying to get back in shape...not that he is bad out of shape, he just wants to get "buffer" Hmmmm...Is "buffer" a word?  Gene, If your reading this; I love you. I am so glad we have worked out all the kinks, and got back on track. I am thankful that we never totally walked away. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I look forward to our future together.   Whoa... I am getting sleepy. Sorry for the sappy stuff.. I am usually not that bad. Promise. So, go on to bed, Go on, I know the suspense of the next post is killing you, but you need your rest. Have A GREAT night!   "Sure I think about you now and then, but it's been a long,long time.

      Hello Fellow Bloggers!  This is my final attempt at starting up a blog. I always start, it lasts a few weeks, and then I burn out. BUT this is something I would really like to get into, maybe it will last this time.   For those of you who don't know, I am a 24 year old country girl lost somewhere in the big city. I have adapted well though, if I must say so myself. I have been living in Memphis for about 6 years. My mother in Grandfather live here also and I have a (almost) two year old dalmatian. I have been dating the same guy for about a year and a half, and plan on making it last forever. I am a Signing Team Manager for a local Department store, and love hanging out with my friends... I guess thats the basics, so lets go on to TODAY!  It was monday. Can I say any more? Everything that could go wrong, Did. I didn't get half of what I wanted to get done accomplished, and.....WHOA... I don't wanna start of complaining, if I do that I will never get anyone to read my blog.  Today was Monday. Period.  Does anyone else watch the Swan? I am a Reality Show Fanatic. I can't believe these people leave there family for months to make a physical transformation. I recently made a rather large transformation myself, but I don't think that I could have been so successful if I didn't have my friends and family there to back me up. Not that I am knocking the show by any means... I plan to watch it...in about 35 minutes.  I gotta tape wrestling too. (I am NOT a redneck) I tape it, and then GENE and I watch it when he gets off. It has become a ritual. I never watched wrestling before Gene and I got together. What is this effect guys have on us gals? Somehow they always tend to rub off on me. Before Gene it was Jeff and Matchbox Twenty... It's just weird how that happens.   I promise as time progresses my posts will be more interesting. I just gotta get back in the swing of things.   "After a while you learn the subtle difference between holding a hand and chaining a soul, and you learn that love doesn't mean leaning and company doesn't mean security, and you begin to learn that kisses aren't contracts and presents aren't promises, and you begin to accept your defeats with your head up and your eyes open, with the grace of an adult, not the grief of a child. You learn to build all your roads on today because tomorrow's ground is too uncertain for plans. After a while you learn that even sunshine burns if you get too much. So, plant your own garden and decorate your own soul, instead of waiting for someone to bring you flowers. And you learn that you really can endure... that you really are strong, and you really do have worth."

      Well I promised you an update on my life since it has been almost a week since my last real post so here goes...  Thursday was just another day of inventory. Long and tiring. I got home, and...Well, I don't remember what happened after that, but I am sure it entelled sleep, or lack of. I have calculated and have decided in the last 10 days I have had about 36 hours of sleep. Compared to sleep needed which is 80 hours for 10 days,  I haven't even had half the sleep I need. I have circles under my eyes! A 24 year year old female as attractive as I am *smile*, should not have circles under her eyes.   Friday I worked 5am til noon. When we got off, Shalinda and I went to Sam's to get the meat we needed for our team BBQ we had been planning. We went to a few more places and I think I finally made it home about 6 pm.  Gene got off at 9:45 or so, I picked him up and we headed down to Tunica. Now, don't get me wrong, I am not real gambler, but lemme tell ya what happened. I put 5 dollars into the nickel machine and I won 100 dollars, so I just kept playing. I ended up winning about 300 bucks, not bad, huh?  I got home about ohhh 3:30 or so. It was a fun time.   Saturday was a CRAZY day. I got up early to go and grab a few things for the BBQ. I also picked up a few clothing items, because I just happened to run into a really good sale.  I hurried home, since we were planning on having between 25-30 people at my house, and I had tons to get done before anyone showed up. I wasnt too worried about the grilling part because Gene was supposed to be there about 4 to start.  They key word was SUPPOSED. His car broke down on his way, so after much debating, I left Shalinda in charge of the grill and headed to pick him up. When we got back to my house there were already about 10 people there. I introduced Gene to everyone and the fun began. Everyone one had left by about 9 or so. (not the norm, but we all had to be at work at 5am Sunday morning.) Gene and I cleaned up, and then we spent a little time together. I took him home, and I think I got home about...midnight or so.  We had an awesome night.   Sunday was a LONG day of work. The last day of inventory is always the worst. I worked from 5 til 430. I got off, went home, changed clothes, and left to go car shopping with Gene. We went to Carmax. Found a couple cars, narrowed it down to one, and started the paperwork. We had to wait til Monday to finalize anything so we left, went to Wal-Mart and got the Secret Window (since we never got to see the end of it), and got take out from Chili's. Ran Gene home and got into bed about 1:30.  Monday....was....a Monday.  We came into work after the week long inventory to return to our normal jobs. Well, all of my department's equipment was gone. ALL OF IT. Turns out they had borrowed it to wrap up PM inventory and didn't return it. We scraped together what we could and went on about our business. I left work and went to Carmax (where Gene was) to pick up his car. He was so happy. I was glad. It's all his. No cosigner. Just Him. I'm proud. :-)He left in his new car (A Dodge intrepid, pictured below)and headed to work. I went home to catch The North Shore, For Love or Money, and Who wants to Marry my Dad?. I don't know about everyone else when it comes to The North Shore, but I KNOW Jason and Nicole are going to end up back together. I am sure of it. And my opinion on For Love or Money, well I home it's PJ. HOWEVER, Preston seems to have something for Racheal. I really hope he doesn't pick Racheal though, because she is a , well she's the reason for the word winch. I guess I went to be about 11.    urlLink    My Baby's New Car&nbsp; urlLink     And now for today. Work was good. I took No lunch so I could leave about 1:30. After getting up at 4:30, I was starving. Gene had dropped his car off at the dealership to get his cd player installed, so I went by there. We sat and waited for a little while, ok, a LONG while, and eventually we went and had chinese food for lunch. It was yummy. Now I am home. I am tired. I am going to take a nap til about 8 or so, and then I gotsta get up, cause Gene's coming over to watch a movie when he gets off. Since I don't have to be at work until 8, it's almost like I will get to sleep in.  Well, I hope I didn't bore you. I know it was long. Hope your week is going well.

      Well everyone inventory is over! I can't believe I made it through it. I didn't know you could survive on two to four hours of sleep for 9 days straight. But I am living proof. You can!   I have quite the recap planned, and now that *@&$!&#$ (that I word) is over, I will be back to my regular posting schedule. But, for right now I gotta run. North Shore starts in approximately 3 minutes!

      .....Wondering if you ever really fall out of love with someone. I mean, seriously...In our lives we have the opportunity to meet some really wonderful people. One or maybe even two of these people we might actually fall in love with. Now here's my question: If you fall in love with someone, do you ever truly fall out of love with them. I mean, true, the relationship may be over and you might have even moved on, but do you ever stop loving someone? I guess it's something to think about.  Let me recap the last couple of days for you since I have not been blessed with much free time lately. Monday I worked 12 hours, I came home, I slept.  Real interesting, eh?  Yesterday I worked another 12 hours, came home, slept, got up. I decided I needed to feel rejuvenated (sp?) so I gave myself a pedicure. Ahhhhh. There is just something about doing the little things to pamper yourself, that makes everything ok. Gene came over after he got off of work. We watched the Goonies. Come on people, ya have to admit, "The Goonies" are about as All-American as apple pie. I watched it alot growing up, but I think that was the first time I had seen it in at least 10 or 12 years. Gene left about 1:00 and I went to bed. I was exhausted! My alarm went off again this morning and I was like , "You've got to be kidding me." It's a good thing I washed my hair last night because I overlsept like 20 minutes and I don't allow myself any extra time in the mornings. I cruised into work at 8:00 on the dot.   Today was a less crazy day at work. I didn't have to do inventory today because I had other responsibilities to tend to. Which was nice. Instead of working 5-5, I only had to work 8-5. It's funny how usually that 8-5 day seems to last forever, and it's not until a couple of 12 hour shifts when you realize, Hey, that 9 hour day is not so bad after all. I got home, changed clothes and went shopping.  I got the cutest Tee to wear to my team's BBQ Saturday.   urlLink    My New Favorite Tee&nbsp; urlLink     I figure that and a pair of Jean Shorts, some flip flops, and maybe a hat, and then I'm good to go. :-) I came home, started some laundry, talked to Gene, and decided to come make a post. I plan on trying to get in bed by 10:30 or so because tomorrow proves to be another 5-5 day. Gene's got a RUSH event so I won't be seeing him, so that basically guarantees a earlier bedtime in itself. I have a big weekend planned on top of dealing with inventory so by Monday I should be a zombie. Serioulah!   "I heard from a friend today and she said you were in town, and suddenly the memories came and took me in my mind, How can I be strong I've asked myself time and time again. I'll never fall in love with you again."

      ...To let you all know that I am still alive. It is day 2 of our week long inventory at work. I am already mentally and physically drained. In two days I've put in 24.5 hours. It wouldn't be that bad, but this is hard, manual labor...Not trying to complain...just so tired.....Zzzzzz

       urlLink    Grandpa at his 70th Birthday Party!&nbsp; urlLink      A Father Is....  A father is a person who is forced to endure childbirth without an anesthetic. He growls when he feels good and laughs very loud when he is scared half-to-death. A father never feels entirely worthy of the worship in a child's eyes. He is never quite the hero his daughter thinks . . .Never quite the man his son believes him to be. And this worries him sometimes. (So he works too hard to try to smooth the rough places in the road of those of his own who will follow him.)  A father is a person who goes to war sometimes . . .and would run the other way except that war is part of his only important job in his life, (which is making the world better for his child than it has been for him.)  Fathers grow older faster than people, because they, in other wars, have to stand at the train station and wave goodbye to the uniform that climbs onboard. And, while mothers cry where it shows, fathers stand and beam . . .outside . . . and die inside.  Fathers are men who give daughters away to other men, who aren't nearly good enough, so that they can have children that are smarter than anybody's. Fathers fight dragons almost daily. They hurry away from the breakfast table, off to the arena which is sometimes called an office or a workshop. There, with callused hands, they tackle the dragon with three heads; Weariness, Works, and Monotony. And they never quite win the fight, but they never give up.  Knights in shining armor; fathers in shiny trousers: There's little difference as they march away each workday. I don't know where father goes when he dies, but I've an idea that, after a good rest, wherever it is, he won't just sit on a cloud and wait for the girl he's loved and the children she bore. He'll be busy there too . . .repairing the stars, oiling the gates, improving the streets, smoothing the way.                  ~ Author Unknown ~   Ya know, I never got the opportunity to have a relationship with my biological Father. However, there were two men who stepped up to plate and filled that void when they didn't have too. One of them was my Grandfather. The other, My ex-stepfather Gene. They both have greatly impacted my life, and I thank God for them daily.    "I remember Daddy's hands, working to they bled. Sacrificed unselfishly just to keep us all fed. There are things that I've forgotten that I loved about the man, but I'll always remember the love in Daddy's Hands."

      Thanks to Gretchen for giving me the info on placing links in my blog. I can't believe it was that simple. Sometimes I tend to make rather simple things difficult though. I believe it is one of my talents. :)  Now that my URL issue is under control, I have noticed that 80% of my blog is now italicised. I have no idea how that happened, but I don't like it. Any suggestions on how to get rid of it? When I go into the posts it doesn't show as being in italics. Oh well....  Went shopping with Mom today, got alot done. I even went to the park and got my walk in. Now I'm tired. It is 9:40pm on a Saturday Night and I am sleepy. Am I getting old? Oh No. This frightens me.   Gene, Will, and Jason ended up going to the Redbirds game instead of the football game. I have no idea where they are now, lol. Probably somewhere where alcohol is involved. Just as long as My baby's safe, I really don't care what they are doing.   I have to be at work tomorrow at 8am in the morning. The dreaded I word (aka inventory) starts Monday. It looks like I won't have another day off until two Saturdays from now. It should be an interesting two weeks, thats for suree. I actually had a BBQ planned for my team for the 26th, but it looks like we might have to reschedule, I didn't want to put it off, because Matt is leaving July 1st, but I don't know what else to do. Maybe I will think of something....and soon.  Well all, I am headed to slumber. I hope everyone's Saturday was a wonderful one.    "I dont want your old letters, and I dont want to be friends. I've had enough to last a lifetime, And i don't want to go again. I dont have to find a reason. I don't have to answer why. It dosent matter who is wrong here. I just want to see you cry."

      As many of you know I am a music buff. I love it. I think it makes the world. It's amazing to me how a song can change a mood, or erase a mistake. It's truly a beautiful thing.  The year is 1997. He is playing all over the radio, you turn on MTV there he is, talk shows, concerts, etc. Bad Boy's Good Boy was EVERYWHERE! Come on people, you know who I am talking about. Mason Durrell Betha aka. Mase.  The beats were good, the lyrics even better, and if that didn't win you over those huge dimples would. Now, after a 5 year hiatus, Mase is breaking back into the music world with an even cleaner reputation.    urlLink    The Good Boy of Hip Hop is Back!!&nbsp; urlLink     Read more about it here:   urlLink Mase's Comeback   Somewhere in a small town in Alabama, there is a very happy girl, that Mase has come back. My best friend in high school, Krissy, was in LOVE with Mase. I mean, posters on her wall, cd in her car, diamond ring on her mind, in love.  We would be going.... well, anywhere, and you better believe "Harlem World" was in the CD player.   "These young boys don't know what a don mean.I'm just a bad boy gone clean.

      Last night Gene and I went to see "Dodgeball". Let me some it up in one word: Excellent!!!   I was skeptical at first. Gene wanted to see it. I had seen the previews and it had looked like it was going to be a pretty stupid movie. I mean, REALLY, REALLY stupid. But it was good. It was hilarious, but on the other hand it taught a lesson. I have to give it tow thumbs up, and I had to admit to Gene it was a good movie.    urlLink    A True Underdog Story&nbsp; urlLink     Today I have to run some errands. I need to go up to work and pick Gene's mother out some sheets. I want to get my nails done. I need to get my Grandfather's Father's Day Gift. Also, I want to get the stuff to start up an aquarium.   Gene gets off at 2, I was hoping we could have lunch, but he is going to take a nap, and then I think he might be going to a Memphis Explorers game afterwords with Will. I am guessing my night will consist of a Pay Per View and a bottle of aquafina, which is perfectly alright with me, especially since I have to be at work at 8 in the morning. And besides Gene hasn't gone out with the guys in a while so he deserves a night out. I think I have been working his nerves a little lately.   Thought for the Day: When you do something totally retarded, when do other people finally let it go?  About oh... 6 or 7 months ago Gene and I had a fight at his Fraternity's Date Party. I made a statement. A rather stupid statement.  Now whenever his fraternity brothers ask about me, they always refer to that statement. I mean...UGHHH! I didn't find this out until last night. Now I will feel totally uncomfortable going around any of them again.   "It's not always rainbows and butterflies. It's compromise that moves us along. My heart is full and my door's always open. You can come anytime you want."

      ...With the rest of the world and bought a George Foreman grill. I know, I am about oh.....5 years behind but oh well, Better late than never, Right?  Work was good today. Spent most of the day in my office. That NEVER happens. I got alot done though which is  a good thing. After I got off work I ran to Hallmark to get my Father's Day Cards. It was kinda hard for me to pick out one for Gene's Dad. It wasn't that hard to find one for his Mom for Mother's Day, but I guess Me and his Dad just aren't as close. I dunno.  I found the cutest card for my ex-stepfather. It will definately put a smile on his face.   This weekend proves to be pretty interesting. Tonight, Gene and I are going to see "Dodge Ball", that is his idea, of course. We may come back to the house and hang out for a while, but I don't know. He has to be at work early in the morning, so we shall see. Tommorrow Mom and I might go to the Zoo, or Liberty Land, or something...which will be cool. Sunday I have to go into work from 8-12 and then we are planning to grill out for Father's Day.   Right now I am sitting here debating on whether or not to run down to Super Wal-Mart or not. There are a few things that I need to pick up. Hmmmmm...I might as well.   I hope everyone's weekend is off to a great start!    "I've seen that look before. Here comes the doubt again. You think that guy we saw, was more than just a friend. Yes, there was a time. I thought he had it all. He meant the world to me, back when the world was small."

      I bet you think that I had given it up, huh? Nope. Just been super busy/super tired the last few days. I am sorry if I have disappointed any of my blog followers.  Well, let's see It's now Wednesday and I am just getting home from work, and preparing to squeeze a nap in here somewhere. I talked to Gene on my lunch break and he said he might come by for a little while tonight, so I think it is only fair if I get some rest so I am not a zombie if he comes by. Well, I mean, more so than normal :-) On another note, I got an email from Marcus, he and Rita have made it to Memphis and are settling in nicely. I hope to get together with them soon.  Now for the past three days in review: Sunday Gene and I headed down to Tunica. We stayed at Bally's, had a good time. Lost some money. Like I said before, it is always good to get out of Memphis every now and then.   Monday, after we got home we both returned to our seperate residences and got some rest, and relaxation. Gene was REALLY stressed out about his car and everything, so it was better that we put off seeing eachother to another night. Don't get me wrong , I want to be there for him when he is down, however he is the kind of person who needs to be alone when he is frustrated, and as hard as it is for me, I try to give him that.  Tuesday, I returned to work. It was a pretty busy day. My two new hires came in, so I spent the afternoon training them. Their names are Nick and Steve, and I think they are going to be excellent. This is a good thing, especially since  I have been without a STRONG team for a while, and have found myself doing 3 peoples work. I am excited.  I got home.  Watched The Next Action Star and The Last Comic Standing.  I was really disappointed that the Iranian guy didn't make it through. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that he used the same set each time, but it was still funny.  Okay, thats enough for now. Until...next time.   "So fly.  Go ahead and fly, Till you find out who you are. And I, I will keep my love unspoken, Somewhere in my broken heart. I hope that in time you will find what you long for. Love that's written in the stars. When you finally do, I think you will see It's somewhere in my broken heart."

      ...The regular crowd shuffles in. :-)  Hello faithful blog followers. It's been a day or two, I just haven't had the initiative to post.  So let me recap.   I had to work Friday until 11:00am. I actually would have been off totally, but I had to conduct two interviews. When I finally made it out of there, I rode to West Memphis with Shalinda. We came back to town, had lunch at McAllister's (mmm The BEST grilled chicken salad in town), and then went shopping. I changed my cellphone service. I also got a new number. I wanted to carry my old number over, but that just didn't work out. So...back to Friday, After Gene got off, we went to see "Garfield". OK, it was cute, but it was not near as cute as I thought it would be. Then we came back to the house and hung out for a while.   Today was a beautiful day, hot, but beautiful. I spent some time outsise, watched some TV, picked up Shocker and I some lunch from TB. (Ya gotta try there new chicken ranchero soft taco.), and then I headed over to Gene's house to hang out with him for a little while. We  watched Terminator 3. I hadn't seen that before, and it was a pretty good movie. I talked to his Mom about some stuff she was looking for, for their home, and so on...She is a real sweetheart...  And Now I am home. Gene and I are leaving tomorrow about 2:30 to go out of town, but  just for a day and a half. We will be back on Monday afternoon. I am excited. I need to get outta this crazy city every now and then. As for the rest of tonight, I think I am going to call it just that, in a little bit. I'm pretty tired. Hope everyone is having a good weekend!   "Play me a song, your the piano man. Play me a song tonight. Everyone's in the mood for a melody, and you get 'em feeling alright."

      ....For a big juicy cheeseburger! MMMMM. But, I am not going to feed that craving, because it would be very unhealthy, and I seem to be doing so well on my "healthy kick"   Today was good at work. Had a lot of rearranging to do.  Stayed busy, and the time flew by. Got off about 2:45. Now I am home, blogging away and looking forward to a much needed nap.  Yesterday was good. Very busy at work. Inventory is coming up, so that always makes for a busy month or so. It's funny when you work in the world of Retail, "Inventory" is like a curse word. You say it and people just cringe. It's kinda funny. Needless to say I was pretty sleepy when I made it home. I took a "hour" nap which turned into almost a three hour nap. I got up in time to watch "The Last Comic Standing". Ya know, I dated a guy once who probably coulda won that show. Anyway.... After that I got up and took a shower, (that's always a good thing), and then I talked to Gene while he was on his way to the Fraternity house.   Then it happened. My phone wrang. It was about 3:00am. Yep, I said it right. T-H-R-E-E in the morning. It was Gene. His car had broken down on the way home. I offered to go and get him and bring him home but he had already called his Father. I guess he just wanted me to know what was going on.  I really wish he would get a new car. He needs something more reliable. I misses him. :-(  Haven't seen him since Monday.  For the anonymous poster who left a request to see a picture of Gene; I will get one posted for you soon. I need some updated pictures but we are going out of town this weekend so I'll try to get some new ones on here. Until then you can see a few on my web page.   Just one more day til the weekend! It's going to be a long weekend! I can't wait.  I leave work at 11:00 am tomorrow and I don't have to be back until Tuesday! Whew Hew!!! Life is Good!   "You speak and it's like a song, And just like that all my walls come down. It's like a private joke just meant for us to know. I relate to you naturally. Everybody else just fades away. Sometimes it's hard to breathe, Just knowing you found me. Cuz I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like. Do you know what it feels like? Cause with you, I can let my hair down. I can say anything crazy. I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground. With nothing but a T-shirt on, I never felt so beautiful, Baby as I do now. Now that I'm with you."

      Ahhhh! I am home. Another long day at the plantation. Things went pretty smoothly today, even though one of my Setters left sick, and I had to pull twice the workload. Gotta love that.  It actually made the day fly by and I was on my way to see Dr. Miller.  Lemme say this. I HATE doctors! BUT Dr. Miller is awesome. He has to be my Doctor forever. Case closed.  Sitting here talking to Woody. He mentioned to me last night that we are always talking but I never even mention his name in my blog, So woods... This Blog's For You!!! You know I would never want to deprive you mention in the most wonderful blog ever.  :-)  So.... Did anyone else watch, "For love or money" last night? I have already made it up in my mind that I DO NOT like Rachel. She needs to be gone. yesterday.  Preston seems like a sweetheart. (not to mention he is a hottie) I don't want some glod-digging B%$#@ misleading him. It's just not right. (Oh man. I am pathetic. Listen to me sitting here talking like we grew up together or something.)  Which brings me to my next rant. Why? Why do guys come after you when they are involved with someone else? Is it because they see you as an easy target? (your mistaken!!) Or is it just for the challenge of it?  It never ceases to amaze me how some men steadily chase after women, when they have a woman waiting for them at home. This has happened to me...a few times here recently. One particular incident comes to mind involving a ex boyfriend of mine. If you are reading,  I just want to say this. I am not going to be involved in a love triangle. I am VERY much in love with Gene, and have NO desire to be with anyone else. I am sorry if you are unhappy with your current relationship situation, because I want you to be happy. My advice: Leave her before you lead her on any further, and find someone who puts the spark back in your life. I just can't be that person.  Ok. I feel better.    "I got a hole in me now. Yea I got a scare I can talk about. She keeps a picture of me. In her apartment in the city. Somethings in this world, man they don't make sense. Some things you don't need until they leave you, then they're things that you miss."

      ...But I was just so tired. Sunday was a fairly busy day. I had to go to the plantation for a little while. (That's what I call my job when I am bitter.) I actually worked from 8-12. When I got home I had to put the finishing touches on the decorations for my Grandfather's 70th birthday party. It was about this time I learned that Shocker is TERRIFIED of balloons. He barked at them and would not come back in the house. When I finally got him back in the house he hid under the kitchen table. You gotta see this!   urlLink    Is it safe to come out yet?&nbsp; urlLink     Before I knew it, it was 2:30. No time for a nap. :-( Gene got to my house about 3:00. We grilled out, had cake and ice cream, and watched Grandpa open his presents. I wish Grandma coulda been here for it. Days like this are when it hurts the worst. Gene and I decided it was time for a nap. We slept from like...oh 6:30 until 10:00. I was exhausted. I woke up with a terrible toothache so Gene got me some medicine and he went home for the night. (He is sooo wonderful sometimes.)    urlLink    Don't mess with my baby!&nbsp; urlLink     About 1:30 Mom came storming into my room and grabbed Shocker. (who is passed out beside me in my bed) Apparently he had tore a pillow apart. He snapped. I was SOOOO mad at her. Dogs only have a 20 second memory span. You can't come and repremand them for something they did 4 hours ago. UGHHH! He was scared to go back to sleep after that. I held him all night. Thats one thing ya don't mess with...and that's my baby.   So I had to be at work at 6am. So I got up and dragged myself along. We had a birthday party for Matt so the day went by pretty quickly. Gotta be back at work at 6 tomorrow too though, and it proves to be a BUSY day.   Tonight Gene is coming over when he gets off to spend some time with me. I can't wait to see him. I love him SOOO much. Tomorrow I have a Dr.'s appointment at 3:30. Speaking of Appointments, I have to make a Dentist appointment to take care of this tooth. And I need to do it soon. I just keep putting it off. But, I am not sure if I can make it through too many more nights like last night. *Yawn* Nap time.   "There you are, In the early light of day. There you are, in the quiet words I pray. I've been blessed by the simple happiness of the perfect love we share. Every time I turn around, when I'm lost or when I'm found, Like an angel standing guard, there you are."

      Well, it's Saturday Night. I have no plans, what-so-ever, so I am guessing it is Home and Garden TV and an 11 o'clock night.  Fun! Fun! Fun! I am sure it is a good thing that I am not going out because I do have to work from 8-12 in the morning, wrapping up some last minute stuff. Gotta love it.   Last Night was cool. Gene and I went to Vortex for the concert. It was good. All these people that work with him at Jason's Deli (his 2nd job) were there.  It's like that wherever we go though. We always, I mean ALWAYS see people he knows.   This morning we hung out for a little while, wrestling and playing around. Ya know, these are the moments I would not want to trade for anything in the world. When we are both laughing and there is nothing between us...just love.  After we hung out for a while, we went to the Deli for lunch. -It was good. Take that back, it was delicious. I love that place.  Gene had to go home after that so he could make the credit union before it closed, so I set out to get my shopping done. It is my Grandfather's 70th birthday party tomorrow, so had to get lots of "You're so old" stuff. lol. Came home. Crashed. Tell me People: Is there anything better than an afternoon nap? nuh uh. I dont think so. ( well, ok. maybe a few things. ;-) )  I won't be seeing Gene tonight they are having some BBQ/Party to celebrate breaking their record in first quarter at his job. I am not going. Gene said "No One is Bringing Dates." not necessarily.  There are people who don't even work there anymore that are going, and when we were leaving last night, one of the girls that works with him was like, "I'll see you tomorrow." Gene gave her a look like SHUT UP!! It made me feel about two inches tall. I mean I know he is going with Taylor (one of his frat brothers that also works with him) and Taylor is single, but UGHHH!!! it is so frustrating sometimes.  Those are some of the things that are going to have to change before we get married. If that day ever comes.   Daily Rant: Frat Boys have a ton of female friends. Face it. Nothing you can do is ever going to change that. When you are involved in a relationship where there has been infedelity before, it is incredibly hard to trust. But, if you love someone enough..to give them a 2nd chance to make it work, you have to put all that BS behind you. You have to learn to trust again, and hope they see how much you love them, and in turn, they wont mess it up again. It's hard sometimes.  But if that person messes up a 2nd time..I think your stronger, you don't hurt as deeply, or cry as much...Because I think somewhere down deep you are kind of expecting it in a way. It will still hurt, but just not as hard or as long. Sheesh! I don't know where I am going with this.  Have a GREAT Saturday!   "Somebody said they saw you. The person you were kissing wasn't me.And I would never ask you, I just kept it to myself. I don't wanna know, if your playing me. Keep it on the low. Cause my heart can't take it anymore, and if your creeping, Please don't let it show...Ohhh Baby, I don't wanna know."

      Today was a rather "ungood" day at work.  One of my employees didn't pull her share of workload, and I was left catching the heat. Now, I understand as a manager "Shit Happens" and since you have that word manager on your name badge, you get to deal with it. Ahhhh! Another reason I love the world of retail.   So tell me....For those of my blog followers who are in relationships, especially long-term ones, I have a question for you. How do you "know" you have found your life mate? Is it the sincerity in their eyes, the warmth on their touch, or is it just the way that nothing else in the world matters but that person?  Now.. what do you do if you feel like you are giving a whole lot more than your getting? I mean what if you are pouring emotional support and love on your significant other and not getting as much back in return? Is that what burns a person out on a relationship? Or if you are truly in love do you just never burn out, you just keep giving in hoping for a little back? That's just something to ponder on.  The last couple of days have been kinda rocky on the homefront...(in case you can't tell) But I am not giving up. Relationships are not perfect. But when you find someone who makes you feel complete you gotta hold on.  Through the good and the bad. You can't just walk away when the waters get rough. I think this week has just been rough cause I haven't gotten to spend any time with my baby. Hopefully, tonight will make up for that.             Gene is my   heavenly crush     Get your sweetheart's pet name @ Quiz Me             Which brings me to tonight... Tonight, Gene and I are going to the "Hypnotized Minds" concert at Club Vortex. I am sure it will be alot of fun, and I can't wait to get back on the dance floor with Gene. We are dangerous I tell ya! lol. I can't wait til' we get back home though, I will finally get some 1 on 1 time with him. I misses him!!!  Alrighty.... nuff said, I am going to go and take a short nap before i start getting ready.  Have a GREAT weekend!!!!   "I will go down with this ship. I won't put my arms up and surrender. There will be no white flag above my door. I'm in love. Always will be."

      ....I missed a day. Kinda like a Vitamin or something. You just gotta get your daily dose.  I know that all my regular followers were sooo disappointed yesterday when I didn't make a post, it was just a really blah day.  First of all I didn't go to work because of this horrible heartburn thing I got going.  So I laid around, and did absolutely nothing, basically all day long. Literally.  I returned to the regular hustle and bustle of the working world today.  Gotta love it.  It was a pretty busy day, by 2pm I had developed the startings of a migraine. But thats ok. I got off at 3 and now I am sitting here venting.  Daily Ranting: I am sitting in workload (a meeting we have weekly to discuss the next weeks activities), and I don't have my spectralink (a cell phone managers use in the store only). So, one of the other managers phone rings. She hands it to me, turns out to be one of our Sales Managers. She said. "I have been paging you and paging you. (when you are in the executive suites you can not hear the PA system). I simply state back to her, "I am in workload." (thinking maybe she would just let me get in touch with her after its over) But NO!!! She goes on and on, (Meanwhile everyone is looking at me..like..."Any Day now." Why? Why do people.....UGHHH Nevermind! It's a hopeless effort anyway.  I LOVE MY JOB!  On a better note, Gene just called me. He was on his way to work. I miss him. :-( I haven't seen him since Monday, but we have plans for Friday and Sunday so far, and I can't wait.   Hey... I am thinking of switching cellular carriers. Does anyone know anything about At&T wireless? I've heard lots of pros, not many cons... I do know they are about to merge with Cingular. Anyway, lemme know if you know anything.    "Look at me now, just sitting here by myself, and I think you found someone else, Now I'm gonna have to find a way to put the bottle down. And why, can't you see..That I'm drowning in a puddle of misery...I'm always afraid that your gone, away from me... Always afraid that your lost, in somebody."

      ....Listening to Maroon 5. Wondering where in the H&$% this heartburn has come from! I am serious. I have the worst case of heartburn...EVER.  Today was a rather unproductive day at work. I came home at noon. I was sooo sick at my stomach. I laid down about 2pm. Gene called me on his way to work at about 3:45, Apparently we had a full conversation. I don't remember any of it. lol. I went back to sleep and slept until 6pm. I think your body reaches a point after you go and go, when it just says, "Excuse me, No. I am not going any further. Now I sleep." lol. I don't know, thats my theory.   So.. I am sitting here talking to Clarence, about life, love, and the pursuit of happiness.  I am glad he is home. He makes me really miss Sam. Just talking to him, reminds me of all the good times. :-( I actually tried calling her but her phone is disconnected. Oh well. Maybe she will call me soon.   Well I am going to get off here and play some meaningless games...makes for a rather boring day.   "How dare you say that my behavior is unacceptable, So condescending unnecessarily critical. I have the tendency of getting very physical. So watch your step cause if I do you'll need a miracle."

      Good Morning Everyone!!!  I just wanted to sign on for a second and tell everyone to have a WONDERFUL weekend! I myself am heading to New Orleans!!! I promise to stay outta trouble (well, maybe). Look at it this way, you will never know I was in trouble cause I won't tell you! :) It's kinda like all those corny Vegas commercials. What Happens in New Orleans....Well, you get the jist of it.  Ohhhh... and one more thing.&nbsp; Did anyone else watch the Democratic National Convention?&nbsp; I have two things to say that pretty much sum up my feelings on the current politcal campaign:  1. I have always considered myself to lean more towards Republican views. 2. I will be voting Kerry/Edwards in this election.  Oxymoron? Say what you will.&nbsp; LOL. I wasn't even going to mention it in my blog, but I was encouraged too by a brief conversation I had this morning with a friend;  ME:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I watched the Democratic National Convention last night. HIM:&nbsp; I watched some of it. ME:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lemme say two things about it.&nbsp; 1. I am a Republican, 2. I will be voting for Kerry in the  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upcoming election. HIM:&nbsp; That's a good blog entry right there, lol.  A good blog entry. LOL What is this world coming too? I think blogging is actually becoming a VERY big deal. Jeff said this morning, that he received an email from someone who worked at a local Newspaper. She was doing an article on blogging and she wanted to interview him. WHEW! I could have alot of fun with this... but I am soooo going to be good. This time.  Ya know... I coulda been one of those spokespeople at the DNC last night. I can hear my speach now, It would go something like this.   "Hello my name is Tiffany, and I am representing small-town America. I was raised Republican like my Father and Mother before me. However, now, having the best interest of my country in heart, I want whats best for her. And what's best for her is John Kerry!"  Come on now, that was good. Admit it. :)   "Yeah, this is my town!....Where I was born, where I was raised. Where I keep all my yesterdays. Where I ran off 'cos I got mad, An' it came to blows with my old man. Where I came back to settle down, It's where they'll put me in the ground: This is my town."

      Hello All!&nbsp; Well I just got home from getting a manicure. I love pampering myself.&nbsp; When the rain cloud is sticking above your head theres nothing like a little personal attention to make you feel better.&nbsp; Only one problem. I think I picked the wrong color. (see below) It looks nice, but it may be a little too dark for summer.... oh well. :(&nbsp; It is actually a bit brighter in person .   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bagota Blackberry&nbsp; urlLink      I did notice  urlLink Gretchen  posted again today! Whew! I was getting worried there for a second. :) Hate to lose a good blogger.  Ahh....and Mom is letting me snatch her digital camera for the New Orleans trip, so I will grace you with pictures when I get back. :-)   "There you are in the early light of day, there you are...in the quiet words I pray.

      I know your thrilled.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; &nbsp;So...lots has been happening. &nbsp; Where do I start?   I finally got my medical forms back from my Dr.'s office. He said I can not go back to work until the 10th. The 10th? Are you serious??? I mean...I know I should be relaxing and healing and all that stuff. But do you guys have any idea the mess that I will be going back to after 3 weeks off? I don't wanna think about it. Instant heartburn.   Yesterday was a kinda rough day. Not to complain, I think I may be having a mini battle of the downs. Little things are setting me off. I mean really making me upset. Gene and I have been quarreling for the last few days.&nbsp; I tend to have this attitude that "It is ALL about me and what I want, screw everyone else."&nbsp; Well, when I get like that, it causes problems, and if there is one thing that Gene is not, is selfish. But I called him that...a few times.&nbsp; Truth is, he was there by my hospital bed every day, catering to my every need.&nbsp; So where do I get off calling him selfish, (Whoa this sounds like a reply of the argument).&nbsp; NEXT, I really wanna take a minute to say thank you to  urlLink Jeff , Shalinda, Woody, Rozan, Lorry, and Clarence for being the great friends that you are, and sticking by me through my down times.   We ended up hanging out last night. He apologised, I apologised. And so, the saga continues. :) We did plan out some of our upcoming weekend (in New Orleans) and watched a little of Bad Boys 2.&nbsp; A weird thing happened when I was on my way home last night. A truck followed me turn by turn on my way home.&nbsp; Then they pulled into the house thats for sale next door to me. Ok I know, no big deal right? But it was 2am. Freaky.   Welcome Home  urlLink Kalisah ! I hope you enjoyed Monaco! I am SOOO jealous. I hope everyone's week is going well. Hey, it's Wednesday, Hump Day! Every day is a little closer to the weekend!    "One word.&nbsp; That's all you said, Something in your voice caused me to turn my head. Your smile, has captured me. You were in my future as far as I could see.&nbsp; And I don't know how it happened, but it happened still. You asked me if I love you, if I always will....Well, you had my from hello."

      It's here! It is finally here! It is the first day of my vacation! Now....it seems funny even saying that since I haven't been to work in..oh.....forever.&nbsp; The good news is I am on Company Medical Leave so I am technically not on vacation. And my dear friends, although that does not sound like good news,&nbsp; it truly is, because that means I am not using up all of my vacation days.  There is a problem, however, I have faxed my Company form to my Dr.'s Office twice.&nbsp; When I called her today to check on it, she simplay said; "Could you send it to us again Ms. Adams? Like it was no big deal at all.&nbsp; These people need to realise without this form, I do not get paid. UGHHHH!!!! ok. I feel better now.   I am trying not to be bitter. I should be laying on the beach right now, soaking up sun rays...but due to my current medical condition, (that sounds pitiful, doesn't it?) I am left sitting here, blogging, and the beach trip has been postponed. :-(&nbsp; It does look like, however, that the New Orleans trip is still on, so that should be a good time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also looks like another cruise is in the making for March of 2005.&nbsp; Bring on the sunshine!!!  Last night Gene came over. We ordered El Porton, and ran by Hollywood Video and grabbed a couple movies and a game.&nbsp; We picked up the food and headed home. I had the Fajita Quesadillia.&nbsp; MMMMM...yummy! I only ate like 1/4 of it...but it would be finished off later. It was good that Gene came over. We needed to talk.&nbsp; In relationships you have to communicate. It is a must.&nbsp; But the other hand, you don't want either person to be the stepping stone for the other.&nbsp; I guess it was just time for a "regroup" session. I am glad we had it.&nbsp; We watched Going Greek (my 2nd time), cos' you know Gene wanted to see it.&nbsp; And played a little of "Lord of the Rings. Now, that brings me to this.;  Dear X-Box, I can not go on like this any longer. You want me all to yourself, but I need to be involved with other people. The choices you give me are so limited. It's like you have the best intentions when it is only me, but if I ever want to bring a friend along, and I am not in the mood for sports, your a total jerk.&nbsp; I want to have fun! I want to utilize all the controller slots you've made available to me. I can't do this with you. Your holding me back. I think it's time to let you go.&nbsp; Don't try to stop me. I have met someone else. Someone who enjoys the same things I do, Someone who plays well with others...I'm sorry.  ~Jane~  ROFLMAO, I am too dang cute! I do have a life. I do. I promise.&nbsp; I hope everyone's weeks is off to a terrific start.    "Feels like your making a mess. Your hell on wheels in a black dress. You drove me to the fire, and left me there to burn. Everything you do is tragic. All my life before was magic. I got a disease..."

       urlLink Bush Leads Kerry   I am by no means attempting to spark a political debate. But are you kidding me? I mean...I am thinking that maybe just maybe there is an online typo.&nbsp; I don't understand it... Come on people let's use are brains for more than ear seperaters. I want everyone to take a real close look at the status of our country, and how things have changed in the last four years, and a majority of people wanna go for another four more? So I took this quiz to see where my views ranked...here are the results, I honestly thought they would be more one sided.   1&nbsp;&nbsp; Kerry Score:&nbsp;53%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Bush Score:&nbsp;48%      And now for&nbsp;You Gotta be Kidding&nbsp;Me X 2   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink   &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink Ricky Williams Throwing in the Towel?   &nbsp;&nbsp; Ok so get this, Ricky Williams has decided to retire at the peak of his career, stunning the Miami Dolphins and leaving them with an enormous Whoa...wait, ENORMOUS is a HUGE understatement.)void in their backfield one week before the start of training camp.  So I am not your average chic. I enjoy sports. I LOVE sports.&nbsp; He is a former Heisman Trophy winner (obtained during his days at Texas), This man broke 9 COUNT 'EM&nbsp;n-i-n-e team records.

      That is really, REALLY what I need to be saying.&nbsp; I guess after a week's worth of the good ol'&nbsp; hospital food, you really could care less about "watching what you eat".&nbsp; I have "binged" for the last two days, and that's enough. I keep on and I'm gonna be walking around here looking like the goodyear blimp. AND I don't have an excuse!!! There is NO bun in this oven. Speaking of which, &nbsp;Congrats to  urlLink Gretchen &nbsp;on the soon to be new edition!   Well bloggers, it is Saturday night, guess where I am, come on, come on, guess. I am home. (just in case the entry from my pc wasn't evidence enough) A part of me wants to be out ripping the town up. But a part of me still feels kinda, "blah".&nbsp;&nbsp; I just don't think I am up for closing down the bars tonight. &nbsp;Gene and Will are hanging out for a little while, (at the bottom line) and then&nbsp;I think he is going home to bond with NCAA 2005. I, on the other hand, am thinking bubble bath, pedicure, and maybe a little laundry.&nbsp;   Last night, Gene and I rented this Xbox game, "The Sims, Busting Out". I can't figure it out, at all. I don't know what the object is, (if anything) so I have totally lost all desire in the thing. We also rented "Going Greek". We never got around to watching it, but I may pop it in after my bath. I heard anyone who has ever been part of a fraternity or sorority will find humor in it. I suppose we shall see.&nbsp; Now, I must pay tribute to mine, lol;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink   &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reppin' Delta Zeta&nbsp; urlLink      Now, come on, you didn't think I could let an opportunity slide to pay tribute to my good ol' college days, did you? Speaking of college, I have been thinking about going back to school, well kind of anyway. Thinking about nursing school. Whatcha think? I personally, think I would look adorable in a nurses outfit. (Anyone who actually saw my halloween costume from last year can testify. lol.   So I hope everyone's weekend is off to a great start.&nbsp; I am just ready for next weekend! NEW ORLEANS here we come!!!!    "I didn't ask to go with you to Mexico, I really didn't need the&nbsp;shopping sprees in&nbsp; LA or Melrose,&nbsp; Boy if you didn't know it, well now ya know. I didn't need the furs or the jewelry, because material things, they don't mean much to me."

      Thanks to Kalisah for posting this quiz to her site. Rather interesting.&nbsp; What level have you been banished too?  &nbsp;  Second Level of Hell   You have come to a place mute of all light, where the wind bellows as the sea does in a tempest. This is the realm where the lustful spend eternity. Here, sinners are blown around endlessly by the unforgiving winds of unquenchable desire as punishment for their transgressions. The infernal hurricane that never rests hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine, whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them. You have betrayed reason at the behest of your appetite for pleasure, and so here you are doomed to remain. Cleopatra and Helen of Troy are two that share in your fate.    &nbsp;   The Dante's Inferno Test has banished you to  the Second Level of Hell!   Here is how you matched up against all the levels:     Level    Score       urlLink Purgatory   (Repenting Believers)   High       urlLink Level 1 - Limbo   (Virtuous Non-Believers)   Low       urlLink Level 2   (Lustful)   Very High       urlLink Level 3   (Gluttonous)   High       urlLink Level 4   (Prodigal and Avaricious)   Moderate       urlLink Level 5   (Wrathful and Gloomy)   Very Low       urlLink Level 6 - The City of Dis   (Heretics)   Very Low       urlLink Level 7   (Violent)   Low       urlLink Level 8- the Malebolge   (Fraudulent, Malicious, Panderers)   Moderate       urlLink Level 9 - Cocytus   (Treacherous)   Low      Take the  urlLink Dante's" Inferno Hell Test

       So.... What's your theory?&nbsp; Was I abducted by aliens? Did I run off to join John Kerry's political campaign? Was it that I was wisked away to a remote trpoical paradise for two?, or did I simply experience Blogger's burnout?  &nbsp;  Somehow, I wish that one of those theories were correct. But the truth of the matter is, I have been in the hospital. Yep, the last 6 nights were spent in my very own hospital room. I have been sooo ready to come home, and now I'm here. :)&nbsp; A little tired, but living.&nbsp; I have to go in tomorrow am at 6 for outpatient surgery.&nbsp; I know your all curious, and I will tell you all about it later.  &nbsp;  I hope is everyone has been doing well.&nbsp; I will be in touch. Thank you for your thoughts and prayers,  &nbsp;   "And It's been a while, Since I can say, "That I wasn't addicted.", and It's been a while, Since I can say, "I love myself as well."

      ...AGAIN.   I just got home from the ER. After keeling over in pain at work this morning, Now, this wasn't an unfamiliar pain. No. This was a pain I was ALL to familiar with. I knew I had to do something and I had to do it fast. I struggled my way to the Hospital (thankfully they just opened a new one right down the street from my job.)   After IV's, Morphine, Cat Scans, and a little too many pokes of the needle, I received my diagnosis. KIDNEY STONES. Now this is exactly what I thought was wrong when I walked out the door. I had this same battle earlier this year. I don't know who I have pissed off, but I definately do not deserve this again! Well they got me good and doped up and gave me a few prescriptions, along with a list of "If this happens come back immediately" things.  The Doctor actually gave me the option of admitting me to the hospital, but I wanted to see what happens, so he said, "if the medicine doesn't start working in about 8 hours you will need to come back." Great.   Excuse the typos, I'm high. :) I will post more later. MAN, when it rains, it pours, Doesn't it? Will someone please remove this storm cloud from up over my head?!?!?   "That is somebody else's moon tonight. Those are somebody else's stars....'Cos somewhere tonight, your in Somebody Else's arms."

      Hello All!  I am planning a really nice dinner for Friday Night. Gene took off work and has something "special" planned for us, so I thought the least I could do was cook a nice, EARLY meal.  His favorite food is lasagna. Now, here's the catch... I have NEVER made lasagna before in my life! Anyone out there have any good recipes? Also...Is there anything besides a salad  that I can serve along with it???  Thanks for any input you may have.   "Cos' it's the first long kiss on a second date. Momma's all worried when you get home late. And droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate,'Cos your hands are shakin' so much. An' it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair. Eatin' burnt suppers, the whole first year, An' askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up. Yeah, man, that's the good stuff."

      After seeing this on many other blogs, I decided I had missed the boat, so I'm gonna jump on the bandwagon!   My Firsts:   FIRSTS    First job : I worked at a Texaco station on Hwy 157 in Moulton, Alabama! I know, I know you have probably never even heard of it.    First screen name : MarieTA13   First self-purchased CD : CD? Seriously?  Hmmmm, I don't know, I think it was Boys II Men.    First piercing/tattoo : First piercing other than my ears was my tongue when I was 21. I got my first tattoo (a lizard that is above my right ankle) the day I turned 18. (a total act of, "now I'm 18 and there is nothing you can do about it.")   First real love : Well, If you throw out the high school misconceptions, and box away the college "flings", I would have to say that my first TRUE love, was a Radio DJ from Moulton, AL. (yea, that's the same place where I worked at that gas station.) It's funny how I ended going back home to find a real love.    First enemy : Hmmm.... I am not one too have enemies but I would say my first and only enemy (that I am aware of) was one of my best friends from high school, Lashunda. We tried to be roomates. Not a good idea. It ruined our friendship.    "It must have been love, but it's over now, It must have been love, but I lost it some how."

      I had this nice long post. It was beautiful. I tell ya, Beautiful!  Let me see if I can "re-create"  it.  And then I did it. I hit publish post, and ya know what happened, I got this nice little message about how Blogger was shut down for updates or whatever. So I'm like, ok. I hit the back arrow. SAME DAMN MESSAGE. UGHH my post was gone. So here goes.  I did something bad. Really Really bad. I went into the kitchen. I got a brownie, I put it in the microwave got it nice in chewy, covered it with Starbucks Ice Cream, Hot Fudge, and Whipped Cream. Then I ate it. All of it.   For those of you who know me, you know that I have recently lost a large amount of weight.  Now tell me something,  How can I keep this weight off of me if I am becoming a spokesperson for Baskin Robbins?  I just want to take a second and personally thank  urlLink Kalisah and  urlLink Gretchen  for their comments on my previous post. I really appreciate your heart felt comments ladies. It means alot, I have wrote you each a little something in the comment section of that same post.   Well It's getting late, I think I am going to watch part of a movie and call it a night. I Hope everyone is well. Have a great night!   "I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance, Never settle for the path of least resistence.."

      In case the title doesn't give it away, am not having the best day. Since my posts are generally positive, I feel like it is my turn to pout for a day. Just one day. I promise.  My Mom and I's relationship has been overall "good" for the last couple of years. We've had minor Mother-Daughter tifs occasionally. But that's normal. Every couple of months she all of a sudden blows up. I don't know why. I don't understand it. But when this happens she always says mean, hurtful things. This time was different. It lasted for two days straight. The first day she went off because the dog was barking. I was there with two of my coworkers and she screamed and cursed, calling me everything but Tiffany. The she did the Ultimate. She accused me of something horrible. She, in a round about way, said I was responsible for my Grandmother's Death. This Crushed me.   History Lesson: For those of you who don't know, my Grandmother who basically raised me, passed away about 3 years ago. She was very ill. She had been for a long time. It was too much for my Grandfather to do by himself, and none of their children would come help, because they were all so busy in their own lives. So, I came to Memphis, I left college, right outside of Chicago, and came here. My Grandmother was my heart. I mean that.   So... let me tell you what my Mother was talking about. I used to get frustrated with my Grandma because, yes she was ill, but she quit trying to get better. I would try to get her to turn the TV on for herself, and get herself a glass of water, because all she would do is sit in the recliner, all day and all night. The more she sat, the more the muscles deterioated (sp). I just wanted her to work on getting well. She had given up and I was trying to get her going again. Mom said I pushed her too hard.  I live with those thoughts every day. I would never let her do without. EVER. I would just simply say "Grandma, you try to do it first, if you can't I'll do it for you." I just didn't want her wasting away. Ya know? Just thinking about it...makes me tear up.   Back to the main point.  My mom does this every so often, and because she is my Mother I always go to her and apologise. She has NEVER apologised for the things she has said to me. EVER. She will go out and bye me something.  That's not what I want. I have decided that this time, she went too far, said too much. I want to wait on an apology from her. Thing is, it will probably never happen. So.... whats a girl to do.  Seriously everyone, what do you think? Please be honest and not bias.   Thanks for listening....I promise to be a positive poster again tommorrow.    "Sure I think about you now and then. But it's been a long, long time. I've got a good life now, and I moved on..."

      Today is a very grim day in the love life of some misplaced country girl in the big city. Pictured below is what will cause the end of the relationship that has consumed my life for the last year and a half.   urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     No, seriously, I highly doubt that will happen. However, when a big game like this does come out, I can honestly say that Gene and I's QT dropps like 50 points for about 2 weeks. Literally.  To make matters worse, I am contributing to his habit, so I guess that means I can't complain. I am actually picking the game up for him tonight because he has to work, I know. I know. I am a damn good woman. :)  I was glad to know that it wasn't just Gene, but this is a total male population infection. While I was talking to Gene on the phone, one of his co-workers, Opie (seriously that IS his name), picked up the line and asked if I would pick him up one too. I had to laugh. I shoulda asked if I should check with his wife first. Although we have never met, It's possible that she just may hate me after this. Sorry.   Work today was hectic. But it's over. That's all I really wanna say about it. I hope everyone else's week is going great.  My day will be better about 10:30, when Gene wraps his arms around me and gives me the BIGGEST hug ever!  I also just wanna leave a short note for the person who asked who my first love was. My first love was a good ole' country boy from Alabama. A great man. Things didn't work out for us, but I have no regrets for those days. He truly is a great person. Now, everyone, keep in mind, that by no means was I saying that Gene was not my true love, in my previous post. It was just a random thought. I have those sometimes.   Oh yea!!! Don't Miss It!! For Love or Money starts over tonight. Can't wait.    "Maybe it was Memphis, Maybe it was southern summer nights, Maybe it was you, maybe it was me, but it sure felt right."

      Well, fellow bloggers, looks like I will be venturing out this evening. This afternoon I took a 2 hour nap. It was lovely. I woke up and called Racheal. Looks like Racheal, Jackie, Tamara and I will be going out on the town. A girls night out, 2 weeks in a row? WOW.   Gene called me when he woke up, or I called him...Turns out he is not going to the Bachelor Party (WHAT??). I couldn't believe it. Turning up the opportunity to see strippers (which i know are going to be there whether he admits it or not), to go hang out with a few close friends. I am impressed. Very. Actually Gene's friend Will (whom I mentioned in a previous post that  I didn't care too much for has received a job transfer/promotion to go to Richmond VA. So I guess that has a little sway on Gene's decision for the night. Ya know, in the past Will and I clashed, but the last week or so has been different, has there been a revolution?, Or am I just aware that there is only a month or so of him left? honestly, I think it is the first one. I'm trying to mend old wounds here people. *Audience Applause*  Now, I have a few more old sores to mend and I should be virtually un-hatable.  So anyway....Gene, Will, and Jason are going to the bottom line, after that I am not sure what's in store for them.  Today's Random Thought: Some people in this world, are lucky enough to find true love. I believe in life you may fall in love numerous times, but that you only find true love once. Many times, we let our one true love walk away because we didn't realise how hard it would be to live without them until they were gone. Maybe you took them for granted, or maybe you tried to make them happy for a long time, and got no response, and when they finally decided to come around, you were tired. Instead of giving it one more try and making it last, you walked away. Then some time passes and little by little you realize that you walked away from Destiny, and now Destiny has someone else, and there is no going back. Love is Crazy, isn't it? So you pick yourself up, dust yourself off and move on. Realizing that now you have to settle for life's second best.   Ok....Sorry for the emotional outburst. Man that reminds me of a Monica song.   "I’ll tell you what hurts the most is I should have, took the chance, Boy when you came to me and offered me your hand, Silly of me I thought I’d always have your heart. I had the chance to have all your love. Oh, how I'm missin you now."

      I guess it's because I grew up loving Winnie-the-Pooh, especially Eeyore. I LOVE(D) Eeyore! So when I ran across this Quiz while browsing blogs, I just had to...        Which Winnie the Pooh  character are you?                 Take this quiz at urlLink              Sparrow's Song   Quiz Page.

      So last night Gene and I stayed up playing Video Games (yea, I know I am a big kid) until almost 3 am. So, why, pray tell, was I up at 8am this morning?  The one day this week I can actually get some extra sleep and what do I do? Sheesh.  Yesterday was a crazy day at work. I had two meetings I had to squeeze in between a total store price change, on top of a conference call (that I bluffed--those of you who live the corporate lifestlye know exactly what I'm talking about:-P), I also needed to do TIA's and work on my Touchbasis. I thought that I just might get it all acomplished when at 2:30 I noticed that I had just received a blast of oh...about 1600 advertising signs or so, that all had to be printed and categorized for the nect price change which just happens to be first thing Monday morning, and people wonder why I always seem so rushed.  I got off about 4, and headed to Crystal's to get my nails done. Manicures, Pedicures, I love em. It totally rejuvenates me. My Mom was up there also, getting her mani and pedi before her trip to Boston. She wanted to go shopping, but I was totally drained, we opted out for a shopping trip tomorrow, and a nap then.  So that means sometime today we're going shopping.  I slept from like 6 pm til' 8 or so. Got up...checked out some more stuff for Gene and I's NOLA trip, and played some with Shocker.   Gene came over and that's when the real fun began. We played a few levels of this video game we've been working on, and then put in this new game, that unbelievably was like a new, updated Mortal Combat. Can you believe it? Could there be anything better. Well, to say the least I kicked Gene's ass. Now ladies, just for future reference, you should never, I mean NEVER beat a man at a video game. It's a major ego wounder. So he wanted to play again...and again...and again...and ya know what? He did get one or two wins in here and there. I couldn't let him go out feeling like a total loser, Could I?  Tonight may prove to be a rather uneventful night. I MAY (keyword MAY) go out with Racheal and/or Shalinda tonight. not quite sure. I may just stay at home, watch a movie or two and relax. Gene had a bachelor party to attend, so all I have pretty much decided is that whatever my plans are that they won't involve him, well, at least not for tonight.  Thanks to  urlLink Gretchen  for giving me the direction on posting links on my blog, I will hopefully be updating that soon...today.  I hope everyone is having a great weekend. The bluff city it gorgeous today. Get out and enjoy it!   "Ive never ever cheated, Ive never ever lied, so you can stop asking,asking me why, why i never left you, and why i kept it real,and why im still with you. You shoulda known better than to think I would leave, you shoulda known better than to doubt me, It don't matter if your up, matter if you down, either way I'm gonna be around."

      Last night was a rather unproductive, enjoyable evening. I blogged, took a nap, watched some tv, and well, thats about it.  Does anyone else out there watch The Great Love Test (or something like that)? Last night Jayre quit the contest (and threw away 100k) to save his Relationship with Carolyn. In that a good man or what?  Speaking of good men. Gene made a 84 on the boyfriend test (found the link courtesy of the link that   urlLink Overdressed  had on her blog for Personality Tests)   Your boyfriend score is 84.   Not bad--does he have a brother? Keep polishing that rough rock. The nail that sticks out must be hammered down. And other tortured construction metaphors. Honestly, if he doesn't have fear of commitment or scabies or a wife, I think you're on the right thread.   I also took the Personality Test.  Wackiness: 50/100 Rationality: 34/100 Constructiveness: 56/100 Leadership: 30/100   You are an SECF--Sober Emotional Constructive Follower. This makes you a hippie. You are passionate about your causes and steadfast in your commitments. Once you've made up your mind, no one can convince you otherwise. Your politics are left-leaning, and your lifestyle choices decidedly temperate and chaste.  You do tremendous work when focused, but usually you operate somewhat distracted. You blow hot and cold, and while you normally endeavor on the side of goodness and truth, you have a massive mean streak which is not to be taken lightly. You don't get mad, you get even.  LOL!!! I can honestly say I have never been called a hippie before!  If you wanna take the Personality test, you can find it  urlLink HERE   So after my usual dose of Reality TV, I decided to call it a night. I was exhausted, or so I thought. I got into bed about, ohhh 11 ish. I woke up at 12:30 and again at 1:15, and again at 2:30, 3:30, 4:15, and so on. I finally got up at 5 and said forget it! What's wrong with me people? For me to be so tired, ya think I woulda been able to sleep better. I dunno.  Work was good today, had a lot to do, but got it all done. Things actually flowed pretty well. I was impressed, my two new hires, took over their areas today, which was a huge load off me. I am interested to see how it all turns out. As for tonight, seems like I may have a semi-busy evening. I told my Mom I would highlight her hair for her, and I wanna try and catch North Shore (cause I missed Monday). I also need to finish laundry and stuff. Gene is coming over when he gets off, so I am working within a time frame. I wanted to take a little shopping trip too, not sure if I will make that one or not.   After seeing Overdressed ad the links to her blog, I am super jealous! :-) yet, I have no idea how to get them on here. Help me please!

      I just heard a really sharp pop, sounded a little more serious that a fire cracker, or some Roman Candle. Hmmm, that's scary.  It's been a crazy couple of days. Work has been interesting, to say the least. I think the company I work for is experiencing some financial difficulties, although if they are, they are doing a really good job of keeping it on the hush. My office is in an area where all the other executive's offices are, and it just happens to be right between the HR Manager and the Operations Manager, so I catch parts of conversations here and there. As much as my job works my nerves, the thought of having to look for a new one unvoluntarily frightens me.   On a brighter note, 16. That's how many days til I go on vacation. I took my big vacation earlier this year, so nothing to extravagant is planned. I actually have two "mini" vacations planned. My Mom and I were planning a trip to Vegas for the first part of the week, but it looks like we may be headed to the beach instead (which is fine with me). So...it's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at the beach, then I come back home for a day, and Gene and I head to New Orleans Friday Morning for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday in the Big Easy! Any suggestions for restaurants/entertainment in New Orleans? We are staying at the Crowne Plaza on Canal, 1 block from Bourbon. I mean we have been down there a few times before, but I am always up for new excitement if anyone has any ideas. Saturday may prove to be a trip to Six Flags.   I hope everyone is doing well. I apologise for the lack of posts lately, (I know your SOOO disappointed) I think I have yet to fully recover from inventory. I'll get better I swear.

      Hello All. I hope everyone had a wonderful 4th. I did. I ate too much. Way too much. :-) Let's see....  Saturday night Shalinda, Jackie, Racheal, and I headed to Vortex, we got there to find an empty parking lot, and locked doors. What???? I couldn't believe it. I don't know when it closed, but Gene and I were there about a month ago. Well, we all debated for a few seconds and then decided on heading downtown. It was Packed! It took us about 20 minutes just to get into a parking lot. We finally got settled, and headed to Beale Street. I think half of Memphis was there. Literally. We decided to head into Club 152 to dance the night away.   Sunday, I slept in. Like until...11. That is a big deal for me. I went to bed about 4:30 though so it was only about 6.5 hours sleep. I would've like to sleep all day, but I had too much to accomplish for that. Got up, took a shower, and got dressed. I ran to the grocery store to get a few things that I needed, one of which was Cream of Mushroom Soup for the Green bean casserole, while I was there the lights went out in the store.(Now that makes for an interesting situation). Anyway, I finished up my shopping and headed home. I was mixing everything together for my casserole, I opened the soup, WHAT??? It was chicken Noodle soup. I had bought a huge can of chicken noodle soup. Sheesh. Maybe I didn't get enough sleep. Gene was on his way over, so he scooped me up and we got some soup...the right kind, and rented a few xbox games to play. And play X box we did. until...almost midnight. We decided to watch Badder Santa. I was dozing off throughout the movie. Not because it was a bad movie, probably because I had already seen Bad Santa in theatres. Same movie.  This morning I got up to find that yesterday'a adventures had added 2 lbs to my weight. Gotta fix that.  I have decided not to do too much today. I am going to enjoy the last day of my 4day weekend. :-)  Later on, Gene is going to come over for a while. I'm going to try to have somewhat of an early night so that I can start my work week refreshed.    "How come. We don't even talk no more, and you don't even call no more? We don't barely keep in touch at all, I Don't even feel the same love when we hug no more. And I heard it through the grapevine, we even beefing now, after all the years we've been down, Ain't no way no how, This Bullsh*t can't be true. We family, ain't a damn thing changed unless it's you."

      ....How was your night? La la la I seem to find myself in  a wonderful mood this morning. And just how are you all doing?  Yesterday was a good day. I stayed online most of the day, playing mindless computer games. Last night when Gene got off, we went to the movies. We were going to see the 11pm show, but the place was packed. So Gene bought two tickets for the midnight show, and we decided to run by Micheal's Party. When we got in the apartment complex, after driving around in circles, we called Cedric to see where it was, and if anyone else from work was there. He said it was just him, Nick, and Micheal from work, and the rest of the people were just Mike's friends. So we passed, and headed back to the Theatre.   The movie for the night was SpiderMan 2. In a word: Excellent. A non-stop action movie from opening line to closing credits, with just enough romance thrown in to keep the female viewers happy. I never once looked down at my watch to see how much longer it would be til it was over. Now, that says alot right there. A masterful performance by Tobey Maguire. I love when you can actually see the emotion in an actor's performance. It makes it much more real. If you haven't gotten a chance to get out and see SpiderMan 2 yet, I won't ruin it for you, all I have to say is this; "There will be a Spiderman 3."  After the movie Gene and I came back to the house to hang out for a little while. It was so cute, when we walked in the door, Shocker was laying on the couch and he had rearranged the pillows to where his head was on one, and he was covered up with another. It was definately a kodak moment.  Ohhh....Speaking of Shocker, I did some research on why he might be chewing his paws. I think I have narrowed it down to Nail Fungus, or an allergic reaction that's causing some serious irritation. Either way it goes, I am going to call the Vet on Monday and make an appointment to have him checked out.   Today I am having lunch with Gene about 3:00, or when he gets off. Looks like chinese, and I am perfectly ok with that. I'm already hungry! Tonight Shalinda, Racheal, Jackie, and I are all going out. A night out with the girls, can't wait. Haven't had one of those in a while. A long while actually. I love going out with Gene, don't get me wrong. But there is just something about getting out with the girls that just makes ya feel good. Ladies, you know what I mean. Reminds me, I need to get my nails done today also.  Any big plans for the 4th? Gene and I talked about trying to get out to one of the displays here, but it is always so crowded. I guess we'll see. I know a cookout is definately in the plans, and Gene has challenged my Mother to another game of monopoly. (She slaughtered us last time.) Could be an interesting competition.  Have a Great Weekend!   "Get this Party started on a Saturday Night. Everybody's waiting for me to arrive. Sending out the message to all of my friends, We'll be looking flashy in a Mercedes-Benz, I got lots of style, check my gold diamond rings. I can go for miles if ya know what I mean."

      Good Morning Beautiful World! Good Morning Beautiful People! It's Friday, I'm off work, and I plan to do absolutely nothing at all!  It's been a crazy couple of weeks but that's all behind me now. I have quite the weekend planned actually. Today I need to run to Wal-mart and pick up some hangers, because for some odd reason the clothes in my closet have been breeding at night, and now I don't have enough hangers. I also want to get my nails done sometime today. Tonight Gene and I are going to see Spiderman 2 when he gets off, then we are going to swing by Micheal's (a guy I work with) party for a few minutes. Not too long cause Gene has to work in the morning, we may end up ending the night at my house just hanging out. Saturday I am having lunch with Gene, and then Saturday Night Shalinda, Racheal, Jackie, and I are going to hit the town up and see what the town has to offer. I think alot of people from work are actually going out also, so it plans to be an exciting night. Sunday we are cooking out, playing monopoly, shooting fireworks, ya know the normal 4th stuff. Late Sunday night Shalinda and I may go out. Not sure though... Then I am off Monday too. Ahhhhh, the joys of life.  As I blog, Maury is on the tv. Today shockingly, it is not about paternity. It is about kids with talent, I mean BIG talent. There are 5,6,7 year olds that can sing their ass off. I mean they can really blow. They could outsing me any day of the week, that's for sure.  So...I have a question.  Shocker, keeps chewing his paws. I mean he puts the ENITRE thing in his mouth. I am planning to call the vet today anyway, but I was just wondering if anyone may have an idea as to why he does this. I'm worried about him. Call me paranoid, but thats my baby and if anything happened to him, I'd be heartbroken. Anyway, let me know what you know.    "Things come & go, seasons change, people grow, The world turns, but our love remains the same. Things come & go, Winter, Summer, Spring and Fall. Through it all, our love remains the same."

       urlLink Kalisah  pulled through and gave me all the information I needed to add my 100 things to my side bar! Your the best. I mean it. I would say that even if you weren't the one to assist me during my time of technical difficulties!  So there it is, shining like a beacon in the night, my list of 100 things... also known as my rendition of more than you ever wanted to know.... lol. I'm so proud... I just might do a 100 more.  :-)   "When I was rocking Jellies, and had  a little belly, who would have ever thought, you would think I was sexy. I stayed with an attitude, I admit I came off rude, but still you loved me. I know I get on your nerves sometimes and I don't know why....you take me as I am."

      I was skeptical at first. Last night Gene and I rented a few movies for a stay-home kinda night. He picked out Hellboy. I didn't wanna see it. Had no interest at all in watching it. He did. Since I don't have the best ability of picking out decent movies, I went ahead with it. All I can say is; "EXCELLENT". I am not the best movie critic out there, so I borrowed :) some info from my good friend,  urlLink Roger Ebert .   urlLink    Just might be a new favorite...  urlLink     Basically I just wanna say this. If you haven't seen it. See it. It is worth the 4 bucks to rent it. I just may even watch it again.  "Well, it's the first long kiss on the second date, Momma's all worried when you get home late, and dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate cause your hands are shaking so much.."

      I did it. I followed those who have gone before me and have finshed my list of 100 things. Now, the only problem I have is the fact that I have no earthly idea of where to put it, or how to link it to my page. Can somebody help me??? Please. :) I know, I am always asking for something. It will be a good list. I promise.   "From this moment, life has begun. From this moment, You are the one. Right beside you is where I belong. From this moment on. "

      .... I honestly don't want to know if I am dreaming. Yesteday was an unproducitve, yet good day for me. I spent a majority of the morning/afternoon online, cleaning up a little, nothing real important. I lost track of time. I saw  urlLink Kalisah's  post on going to see John Edwards. I looked at the clock 3:12. There was no way I could make it down there. I was so pissed at myself. UGHHH! Before reading any futher lemme say this, This is going to be a here and there, random thought post. Sorry guys, bare with me. I have alot of thoughts running through my head right now.  Yesterday, Gene and I had a serious conversation. No big deal to some people, but with us it is a very big deal. We are so busy laughing and joking around that we don't have serious conversations that often. Last night we talked about the future. About him wrapping up school, us getting MARRIED, and moving. YES!!! M-O-V-I-N-G. it may take a while, but to hear him talk about these things in detail was very encouraging to me. He said, as soon as he is done with school, hopefully he can get a 6 month internship here in Memphis, which will give us long enough to get the wedding together, then we can get married and get the HELL out of Memphis. To hear HIM talking about marriage and all was exciting. It gave me a spark of hope, lol. Still no ring though, so no holding my breath. But hey, if he talked about it...at least he is thinking about it, right? I was born on the ocean, spent the first 6 years of my life on the ocean. That's where I wanna be more than anything, and it makes me happy to know Gene is willing to give that to me.  I mean he has always been here. His family is here, his memories, his friends, etc.  It just means alot to me.  So let's see. Last night I watched  urlLink The Player . ROFLMAO I only have one thing to say about that show. NO. I have to admit it, it had me rolling, but it is supposed to be about, being a playa, having game, and getting a girl. From what I can see right now the girl is the biggest playa in the group. Ahhhh..Reality Television. Yep, a new have to watch. lol.  Speaking of have to watch's, lemme rewind a few days to Monday. I know someone out there watches  urlLink The Northshore . (Oh and may I please ad that Frankie is HOT!!!) It was the best episode of the season so far. When Nicole left her wedding, I was litterally sitting in my seat screamin, "That's it girl, Go get your man!!!" Then when she got to Jason's house he was in bed with the island whore ( that would be my name for Tessa) (I hate her). Tessa saw Nicole. Jason did not. The episode ended with Nicole running out and collapsing on the beach in tears. I promise. If I was in Hawaii, I would have drove to Jason's house myself and beat Tessa's ass!.... I know, I know, but you can't tell me that there is not a show out there that you don't get into like that.  Ughhhhh!  Well, I guess that is enough rambling for now. Don't worry though. I'll be back, with more.   "Meet me at the altar in your white dress. We ain't getting no younger we might as well do this. I've been feeling you all the while, girl I must confess. Girl let's just get married. I just wanna get married."

      Ok...first of all, lemme say this. I have told you all before that I am a copy cat. It's just me. It's horrible I know. I can't help it. I saw this on  urlLink Shannon's Page , and you know I had to, just had to snatch it.                                                                                      The Peach Random   Gentle   Love   Master   Playful, kind, and well-loved, you are The Peach.    For such a warm-hearted, generous person, you're surprisingly experienced in both love and sex. We credit your spontaneous side; you tend to live in the moment, and you don't get bogged down by inhibitions like most women your age. If you see something wonderful, you confidently embrace it.   You are a fun flirt and an instant sweetheart, but our guess is you're becoming more selective about long-term love. It's getting tougher for you to become permanently attached; and a guy who's in a different place emotionally might misunderstand your early enthusiasm. You can wreck someone simply by enjoying him.   Your ideal mate is adventurous and giving, like you. But not overly intense.   "If you like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain, If your not into yoga, if you have half a brain, If you like making love at midnight..in the dunes on the cape, the I'm the love that you've looked for. Write to me and escape."

      This house seems empty now. You could hear a pin drop. Every footstep you take across the ragged floor seems to echo within it's bounds. The dust layers the old pictures, and the glass on the windows is thick with years of dirt and weather.  However, you've been here before. Those stairs, the one's there, missing a board or two now, those are the stairs you slid down on your sled when no one was looking. Oh, and By the way... Momma knew. Oh, and there by the old bureau, the one where you spilt the soda you "stole" out of the refrigerator sits the umbrella you used to hold as you jumped off the porch on your attempt to fly. Oh and by the way...Momma knew.  Your round the corner into the family room, the presence seems even thicker now.  It's almost as if you can see her there, sitting at the now, rickety old piano. Her gentle hands working away at the keys. It was the most beautiful thing you have ever heard.  It's the same place you would run to and bang on the keys like a little Beethoven when Momma had ran to the corner store. Believe it or not, Momma knew. Around every corner and bend of the old house holds more memories, and more secrets. The time you kissed the little boy from next door by the deep freeze where no one could see you...No one but Momma that is. She knew.  It was memories like these that kept the spirit in this old house alive.  As the day faded away into night enveloping the house with an unfamiliarness you never knew. It was as if it was almost taking the life itself out of the old house, and you turn to leave. You go out the back door, the same one you had escaped out of many times before, with a different sense now.  Once the door you couldn't wait to get out of,  has turned into the door you wish you had never left.  But now, the city calls, the hustle and bustle of business people passing by on a much to crowded sidewalk beckons you. You get in your car and drive back to the life you have made elsewhere, but you can't help but take one more glance into the rearview as your old home fades into the night.  You don't have to wonder if she knows you came back, finally , that one last time to say goodbye. The only regret you have is not coming back when the goodbye could still be heard. Oh but wait...Momma knows.

      Well, here it is. The much awaited recap. Take your seats, buckle in, this could be a long bumpy ride.  Friday morning we made it out of Memphis about...10 am...Suprisingly on time. We picked up some breakfast in Southhaven and headed down to New Orleans. Gene drove... the entire way down there despite his earlier protests that he was NOT driving at all, because he always drove, and it was my turn. mmhmm. anyway. We stopped right outside of Louisanna for some lunch and made it in about 4. We pulled up to the  urlLink Crowne Plaza  and we were immediately greeted by valets, bellcaps, and hotel management. To say the Hotel's customer service was Superior would not do it justice. They took our bags, and we checked in. A painless process. We ordered a refrigerator (only $25 bucks)for our stay, and they had it in our room within 10 minutes. We relaxed for a few minutes. We actually planned on taking a nap, but heck...this is New Orleans. We freshened up, and headed out to find some dinner. We ended up at a little jazzy hole in the wall on Bourbon. I don't remember the name of it. But I do know they were having 2 for 1 Happy Hour and that is what coaxed us inside. There was this awesome jazz band playing. I wish I could remember what they were called. UGHHHHH. The menu selection was minimum. Very. However, I did have an excellent brisket sandwich. We also ordered an appetizer of  urlLink Boudin Balls . It was the first time I had them. They were delicious!! Now of course, at the time I didn't know what they were made with but oh well. We went back to the room, showered, and changed into going out clothes. (Ya know what I mean) :)  We hit Bourbon Street About 11 and it was already packed. We walked in and out of a few places, and eventually ended up at  urlLink Tropical Isle . There was this Super Cool Chic (as  urlLink Kalisah  would say) who was a bartender, Marti, there. I know we talked to her for a good hour or so. Here's the super cool part..She was at least 60 years old! I mean... I had major respect for this woman. Gene had this drink called a Horny Gator...lol. It was tooooo sweet. She kept adding more alcohol to it until he found it drinkable. Ahhhh...good times. We left there and headed to another place (which I can not disclose for fear it my inciminate me :-P) . I will say this much though. Our night ended a little early because I spilled a drink off the bar into Gene's lap. I mean..the good part where it looks like you just couldn't make it to the bathroom. I found it hilarious. It was just enough for him to get good and pissed off. I mean you would have thought I picked up the drink, looked him square in his eye, and poured it into his lap. (Now looking back, I should have, lol) Since we were staying right on the corner of Bourbon and Canal, we went back to the hotel room. Gene was ready to change clothes and head back out but I ready to crash (Gimme a break, I just got outta the hospital). Iw as hungry though. We found this delivery menu for a place called The Moonlight Cafe that delivered til 4 am. I don't know if it was because I was starving or not, but they made the best cheeseburger I had EVER tasted. Seriously. We got in bed I guess about 4 or so.  Satruday was an action packed day. I got outta bed about....11. I finally got Gene up about noon, and we talked about plans for the day. I really wanted to go to Margaritaville for lunch, and he was basically for whatever I wanted to do. So we got up, showered and headed out. We walked from to Decatur St. (not a bad walk about 5 blocks or so) and then we went down Decatur in search of Margaritaville. We walked, and walked, and walked....No Margaritaville. We passed a couple of interesting places, however, so I told Gene if we didn't find it soon we could turn back. We did. I am glad we did. We ended up having lunch at  urlLink Bubba Gump's . I don't know if anyone has ever been there, but I love this place. It is all based around Forrest Gump (of course). Gene who apparently is a HUGE Forrest fan (I DID NOT know this before we started dating, lol) answered every question in the call-out line the waiters gave.  I mean EVERY question. One of the waiters was like, "Dude, what do you do? You gotta get a life man. You know more about this than we do and we get paid for it." The food was excellent. The service was even better. We both had this melon sky drink that had flashing ice cubes in it. (Ok, I admit it, the only reason I got it was for the flashing cubes.) We left there and walked some more through the French Qtr.  Got back to the room about 5 and decided to take a much need nap.  Gabe (Gene's old college roommate who lives in New Orleans), Erik, and Kris got in touch with Gene and wanted us to hang out with them Saturday Night.  The bad thing about this scenario is I know this group of guys pretty well. I know how alcohol effects them. The good thing, Gabe is a local, so he knows the places to have an "untouristy" good time.  We got up about 7:30, skipped dinner, and got ready.  Gabe and Erik picked us up about 9. We went back to Gabe's place where Kris was waiting on us, the guys played some NCAA 2005 (I told you that this game was invading my life),  drank, caught up on old times, drank, etc. During this process I became the bartender. Gabe and I have never been close, but Erik, Kris, and I have been good friends for a while. It was good to see them again.  Another friend of Gabe's, Matt came over and we called cabs. There were six of us. 5 guys and me. (My life story, lol) We headed to The Red Eye Bar and Grill. It was packed.  A cool place though. Basically it is a huge open warehouse with a bar and a few pool tables and NOT enough bathrooms.  When we got there my eyeballs were floating. So Kris took me to the bathroom. I got out first so I was waiting on him to make our way back through the crowd. This guy approached me and was spitting the normal come on lines. Kris came out of the bathroom and was like, Dude she has a large boyfriend here and he will kill you. (Kris was a little more than slightly intoxicated). Thankfully the guy laughed it off and we headed back to find everyone else. After fighting our way through the crowd and 3 or 4 come on's later, Kris was finally like, "Tiffany give me your hand. Gene is not whopping my ass." It was hilarious....or maybe you woulda had to have been there.  We had a great time. Danced the night away. Heck, I had 5 guys there that it was "legal" for me to dance with, so you know I had a great time.  Well, many hours and many, many more drinks later, it was time to go. Gabe went to pick up his bar tab, and it was this ASTRONOMICAL amount. There was NO way he had drank that much. Even with the round he bought for everyone.  So this guy came over and fixed it. He knocked like 20 dollars off. It was still like 40 bucks too much. So Gabe along with everyone with us was standing at the bar trying to get it taken care of.  This girl walks up and asked what the problem was so Gabe showed all his receipts and was trying to explain the whole thing to her. She reimbursed Gabe for everything.  Well, this is not what he wanted. He wanted to pay for what he had bought, so he was still standing there....trying to "re-pay" for everything, and that's when the original guy walked up. He went off. I mean he called Gabe everything except a male, and threatened him that he would smash his face in if he ever came back in there.  Now, that is when Gene's frat boy outlook kicked in. So....Gene went off. It was bad. I was expecting a 20 person bar brawl right there. Kris, Erik, and I  finally got Gene out of there and we headed down the street. During this process, Gene went off on me. I really was about  this   close to going to the Hotel, getting my stuff and greyhounding it home. Gene apologised over and over, I was just sooo pissed.  (ahhh...anyway that's enough of me sharing our personal affairs...sorry) The really messed up thing about the whole night is Gabe was trying to do the right thing. He didn't want everything free. He wanted to pay his bill. The guy was a major ass.  It pissed everyone off. Gene went off..and keep in mind his anger was magnified by about 8 or 9 drinks, Gabe went off, Matt went off, Thank God Erik and Kris kept their cool. I was just like ......there.  We got back to the hotel at like 6 am.  I packed everything up and went to bed.    I woke up Sunday AM to a few more apologies, and a long drive home.  I know your dying to know, of course I forgave him. I understand the circumstances, although it didn't make his behavior right, it did  however, make it understandable. We made up. And overall a good time was had by all. I do have pictures, I just haven't uploaded them yet. When I do I'll share some of the best with ya!   "I thought it was over baby. We said our goodbyes. But I can't go a day without your face going through my mind. In fact not a single minute, passes without you in it, your voice, your touch, memories of your love are with me all the time."

I hope everyone had a wonderful weekend!   "Its the same thing all night, Whos wrong and baby whos right. Another fight and I slam the door on Another battle...When I look at myself I dont see the man I wanted to be. Somewhere along the line I slipped off track, livin one step up and two steps back."
