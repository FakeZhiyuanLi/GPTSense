          I got to work late yesterday.  I arrived at 2pm, but on the way to work I was upset by a stupid situation.  A gentleman and a girl were talking while waiting for the Blue Loop to appear.  As we were about to get on the loop, the girl started to give the man directions about where he was to get off and such.  I asked where he headed and he replied Schwab auditorium.  I said that he should get off where I was at Pollock and then just walk straight across to Schwab auditorium.  I gave him a map and pointed out the Pollock stop.  The girl protested that he'd have to walk farther from the Pollock stop, but that it would be uphill from the College stop.  So I didn't protest and he said that he'd follow her.  It upset me because I felt less or something because this gentleman didn't trust me or didn't believe me.     I am presently reading the book by Melody Beattie, "Codependent No More."  Specifically this morning I was reading the chapter on detachment and the following chapter, "Don't be blown apart by every wind."  In the situation above, I was blown apart and let this stranger disgruntle me for the better part of an hour.  One of the things that Ms. Beattie highlights is that, "We don't have to take rejection as a reflection of our self-worth."  She mentions this situation where someone we don't even know rejects us or our advice and it still cuts us to the core.  (Because I let it cut me to the core)  Her advice is to talk about the rejection, but not to forfeit my self-esteem in the face of this rejection.  I took this situation personally and I had business taking it to heart.

      So today, July 17, 2004 I'm going to learn CSS so that I can effectively use it for the Conjoint Analysis website. First things first:  To use CSS, you can set the global styles:  &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;    border-color: red;    border-style: inset;    border-width: 5px &lt;/style&gt;  You can set the setting for a specific type of tag: &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt; p {    border-color: red;    border-style: inset;    border-width: 5px } &lt;/style&gt;
