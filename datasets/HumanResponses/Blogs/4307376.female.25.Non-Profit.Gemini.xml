       is regret really a dirty word?  how many of us wake up with a huge ache in our hearts, wishing that tears can somehow buy back time, turn back the clock?  to go back to that one moment in time when we were truly happy and actually cherishing it then?  how many lessons before the lesson is taught?      in that one moment, you can either live it, make it or break it.  how many times before you learn YOU create that one moment to love, to hate, to remember with fondness or let it tear you you in self-indulgent sorrow?      how many glasses and bottles can you take, before nothing else can make you drift off?  when every thought is sobering you up and you're fighting back the urge to cry?  what happens when all your energy transcends into fighting to live with dignity and grace?      learn, dear reader, learn.  it's too late when that phase comes.  you know, the one that feels like you're being pierced over and over and over again.  it's like spending 24 hours a day in a piercing studio.  it's like struggling to tread the water that was put there to swallow you up.  and every sober thought is just another slap of reality.      release?  serve it up neat!      why why why why why?        i may never remember why i posted this, a year from now.  perhaps i might remember, but i might laugh at myself for having juvenile thoughts.  perhaps tomorrow i might have a relevation about this whole incident and start smiling.      but for now, in this moment, there is no solace, no solitude, nothing.  how can there be any, when each breath you take, reminds you of what you've lost?  and every blink of an eye reminds you of what you cannot find again.      hopefully, it's only a phase.

       let me dedicate this space to my friend, EL. without EL, i wouldn't be here today. i'll probably be six feet under or in a little urn, whichever's in fashion in 1996. without EL, i would have fallen into some waterfall. i'm no camping expert and you can tell because i wore slippers for trekking. the rocks were grimy and mossy and wet and i lost my grip. i should have been dead.      maybe EL shouldn't have reached out and gripped my arm. damn. because of what he did, i'm still here.

      It gets like it every few years.  Sitting alone in the car, in the room, in the house.  Nothing on Tv, nothing worth reading.  And every bad memory sinks itself into your skin like a little pin.  It doesn't quite hurt but it sure is irritating.  And you sit.  Thinking.  Thinking about how you're going to get to sleep although your eyes are stinging from the lack of it, about how you're going to feel when the sun rises, about how tomorrow night will be a repeat of tonight.    And you start wondering, hey who snatched the good stuff away and left you bare and you start googling for inspiration and finding none, you start writing a blog to bare it all.
