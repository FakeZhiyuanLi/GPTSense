         what the heck is that? oh that above? a movie i just watched. i woudln't type it like that if it wasn't the actual spelling of the movie title. it's a one-hour movie, roughly around 65 or 70 minutes, with zero spoken words or language. except for the amazing intro, where the director spoke of his dreams as he was a child and how he envisioned it into a movie. just two short (very brief scenes) of him talking in black and white (presumably recorded long ago before he made the movie). then the movie kicked in with a track by daft punk. okay, so basically the whole movie is laced with daft punk's songs and boy... they did it good. the animation is okay, it resembles the style of old jap cartoons i used to watch when i was 6 or 8. drawn like that but they just moved more naturally than the animations in tv. they didn't speak a word, all their actions are accompanied by daft punk songs... i didn't know a whole album would work that well as a language for a movie. it truly shows what music can actually do. i think that would be the only musical i'll ever watch & enjoy. the story's rather questionable you might say... it's abt this alien band who're kidnapped by this old man who looks like something out of a hall of fame of classic songs masters. then they're turned into the next sensation on earth. for what? so that the old man can get more awards to channel some sort of power-tower thingy to control the world. see... i told you it's weird. however, they made gorgeous scenes which depicts friendship, self-sacrifice, nice action scenes and some humans as gullible music consumers. i won't spill all the story, in case some of you might be interested to watch it. i don't know if i can recommend the movie to everybody... it might not appeal to some. however if you're a fan of daft punk, you're certainly not supposed to miss it. oh and guess what? it's one of the few times i watched a movie and at the end of the movie, the whole cinema was applauding. Interstella 5555: 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem would be one of my favourite movies for a heck long of a time.

         just a day in singapore and already the memories start rolling. what? memories of singapore? my ass. memories of that last holiday, when i was in indo. okay, so it wasn't anything near the 'overseas vacation w group of best friends' but it was genuine fun. .i got to spend some time with my old primary school classmates in indo. it's nice to keep in touch. after around 5 long years, i finally get to see them and the changes that came along. visiting the old primary schoolground was fun. it's surprising how nice it was to spend some time with an added sentimental value. it's nice to catch up with old friends, have a chat or two (or three, or four, or five) and just laugh at ourselves.       and if you're wondering, "what's up with the title?", try downloading the song 'letters to you' by finch.

      i think there might not be a boredom which is actually in a way, a bliss on its own, except for when that boredom actually forms out of the scenarios formed by pleasant situations. such as the school holidays of course. hey, when else can you feel ultra bored and still feel happy? when you know that you don't have to come back to school for a period of time, that is. agree or not, it's entirely up to you. however if you tell me you rather go back to school to do all your works, you must be the sickest person i ever met or thought of. right now it's four thirty in the morning, over here at where i'm studying, singapore. it's what happens during school holidays, i become a fully nocturnal mammal. well, when you're blanketed with boredom, sometimes loneliness creeps in to take a stab or two at you. i felt real lonely for a week, all my indonesian friends went back to indonesia earlier than me... and since most of my closer friends are indonesians, that affects me quite a lot. i spent my days listening to downloaded musics, doodled off, pretending i could play the guitar like joe satriani and played ps2 with another fool who's going back to indonesia later than the rest. i stayed over at his place... we spent hours in front of that little black box called the ps2, rained our fingers all over the controllers and we pummelled the hell out of each other in a video game called "snk vs capcom". too bad i was too good for him. then on saturday, one of my best friends came back from his bangkok trip. i was real glad... loneliness can be a pain sometimes (all the time actually). it forces you to feel bored, one way or the other.   i saw photos he took. then i thought, wouldn't it be nice to have a vacation just with your group of best friends?        that would totally be too good to be true. imagine you and your group of best friends on a trip to japan? usa? or wherever you fancy. man... we (my friends & me) could go to shops in usa, which sells all the band shirts, find the cd's we'll never find here in singapore... then i could go hunt all the action figures/toys which never reached singapore... then when all the shopping and item-hunting ends, we could pick a nice hotel, rent a big badass room, order pizzas and slack off for the day, watching tv or some movie. next day we could head off to disneyland or disneysea (disneysea is only available in japan), go there damned early in the morning and spend the whole day just riding roaller coasters, buying souvenirs, taking silly photos, playing pranks on each other, tell jokes along the way, all the way till the closing. if we're lucky, we could watch the fireworks disneyland usually has at midnight. then after that we could all head back to the hotel... and talk till we fall asleep. things could only get better when our favourite bands do a concert at the country, we get to watch right in front and get backstage passes at the same time. i'd be there with my funeral for a friend cd, asking for signatures... this is the ultimate dream. it would be great if we could do this when we're all earning our own money and we find sometime to spend our holiday with our friends from the days when we're all fighting acnes and raging hormones. i better find a good job later on in life and start saving for this dream and keep praying to God He'll allow me to keep in touch with my best friends to make this idea come true. if it does, it'll be the greatest vacation i would ever have.     i hope i'm not dreaming too much. maybe it's the endless peach teas i keep drinking, doing this to my head...

      on the way home from this place, on the bus, one of my friends grumbled. he was whining, how screwed up life is and stuffs like that. then almost unavoidably, he turned to the act of adam eating that whatever fruit eve game him. he said, there would be no school, no naggings and none of more of such unpleasant things in this life. then i asked him in return, whether he was willing to exchange all these stuffs he already had for just the reversing of that act. he thought a while then replied, "but if they never took that fruit, we'll never know these things then we'll never have to make this choice". then i asked him again, "after knowing all the things you know right now, would you?" he thought twice then he shook his head more than twice.

         quite often, people question, "is God true?". the ones who share the faith would answer as fast as they can, "yes". then the next question that comes along is the tricky part, "prove it". oh shit, i didnt see that coming. that's usually the case, people have the faith but they haven't got a scientific or a rational explanation to back up their faith. there are even people who claims that the current God that the catholics & the christians base their whole religion upon is just a figment, created by extremely intelligent pagans. that's a serious threat. it's like saying, "there is no God, the satanic pagans made it all up!". okay, so some would fall for that and start feeling real confused. "what the... all these while, i've been going to church just for some fairy tale conjured by satanic pagans?". whoa, satanic? how can these satanic ones be there... without our God? God created everything. even the one we describe as absolute evil. how twisted can these historians and scientists be... claiming that God is just something a pagan wrote about and that creation is simply a pure matter of strings of coincidence that brings about the monkeys which eventually leads to humans (note that pagans can not exist without God since they are anti-God, just like satan vs God).        listen, there is no evolution. creation is what created us and no matter what the textbooks would say, note that they mention the whole 'evolution' thing as 'The Darwin Theory". a theory is something that has yet to be confirmed as of whether it is true or not. ha! got you there, didn't they. so really, you didn't evolve from monkeys (even if you did wish someone you know actually evolved from something less than human). but no, that's not really the main thing. let's get back to "is God something that's real?". are you asking me? i'm saying yes. ok, let's see the theories they made up, 'God is just something they wrote about', 'God is just something the pagans write about', 'God is just a fairy tale'. let's take the main thing from these 3 arguements, which says God is just something written long ago and grew along to be something that we all come to believe in more and more each time. blasphemy at it's most possible existence.      the bible explains a lot of things, after all it is the word of God. However most of the time, we fail to actually get the messages of how true He is. a lot of questions, the bible has already addressed and a lot more, the bible has already answered.  it answers the simplest questions like, 'why am i so unlucky? why can't i have what he/she has?" to a lot more questions, we, humans face daily. these questions, science can not answer. go ask a scientist of why you're so down on luck. he can no longer turn to his lab book. how has the bible or those who carries the word of God answered that? well, the  father (father being the one who leads the sunday mass) at this church i used to visit when i was a 7 years old answered me, "if God has yet to give it to you, wait patiently. He works in His own time". so the unbelievers turn back at you, 'what kind of answer is that?'. tell them to ask themselves, how often has their own father told them that magic phrase, "no son, it's not time for that yet, you're much too young for that'. of course, the bitterness of not getting what we want usually drowns the ability to understand that there might actually be someone who knows what's best for us better than we, ourselves, know. then sometimes, they lash back, 'what kind of explanation is that, saying He only works in His own time?'. look, let's say you have a pet dog, the dog keeps begging you for the snack treats you keep giving him. out of fear of the poor mutt's teeth rotting out from the measly snacks, you refuse it the right to more, thinking it's best to give him more of those when the time is right, say tomorrow or later at night? isn't that very applicable to your unlucky situation? of course, that's saying if you're the dog. just pretend you are... it's just a given situation.          you know, sometimes it's this kind of simple questions that most matters in life. it represents what makes us human, the ability to question of what is happening to us. for a person to write a book, via different authors who agree on the same answer, authors from a huge timespan who can not turn to each other due to the gap of time, is almost impossible. so it's possible? yes, if it is God who does it. listen, let's say part of their theory is true, someone out there wrote something about all the things that is important for life, what is good and what to avoid, no matter what times you are in. if somebody actually had the ability to read all the way through time and space into any given situation to answer the questions, is it possible? yes. only one person could do that and that person is God.           so this may not answer whatever doubts people have regarding God... but i tried my best, it's hard to write about all the little things into an essay to explain something that is God... i'm not a pastor... not a religious expert... and not a psychologist, just a teenager with a lot of free time.
