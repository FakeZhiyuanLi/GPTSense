         I watched him poring over the selections on his menu, his eyes stopping at each item and narrowing slightly as he analyzed it, trying to decide if it would be safe, then flicking down to the next choice. I wondered what he was thinking. Was he trying to find things that were simple and relatively unmessy to eat? Whatever it was that was going through his mind, it was interesting to watch his eye movements. They would move away from one item, and then return to it before moving on to the next. Then they would move back.“Do you always have so much trouble making decisions?” I asked.“I don’t think I’ve ever had so much to think about in reading a menu,” he said.Finally, he closed the menu and raised his eyes to mine. I smiled, and we waited for the waiter to return. I gave my order first, then we both turned to him to see what he had decided. Salad with no dressing, a steak, and a baked potato with butter.“Very safe, but a little boring,” I said.“This is anything but boring for me,” he said.I reached into my purse and pulled out something bright fluorescent green, rolled and tied with a pink bow.“Put this on,” I said, handing it to him.Slowly, he untied the bow and unrolled the item I had given him. His expression was priceless as he realized that it was a rather large, plastic bib, with a picture of a pink pig in the center of it. He smiled, almost laughed, as he looked up at me. But I wasn’t smiling, now.“Well, put it on. Now, before our food gets here,” I said quietly, but firmly.He seemed to freeze. I could see in his eyes that he was reluctant, but he sort of drew in a deep breath, let it out, and slipped the straps over his shoulders and tied them behind his neck. He looked hilarious as he sat there with his hands in his lap with this bright pink and green pig bib sitting on his chest. And then the waiter arrived with our food. To his credit, he didn’t even crack a smile, but he did seem excessively intent on getting the plates on the table as quickly as possible. I assumed he went back into the kitchen to burst into laughter. The waiter wasn’t the only one to notice the bib, either. Heads were turning toward us from all the tables around us. I guess they’d never seen a grown man in a piggy bib before.But now, I began talking to him about us. I told him what I was looking for, and I asked him very pointed and serious questions about his feelings about being dominated. And, to his credit, he seemed able to think clearly about his answers, despite the fact that he was more or less the center of attention in our part of the restaurant. And he ate with as much dignity as possible for a man in his predicament. He kept the bib on throughout the meal and made no effort to remove it until I told him to.In the end, I was impressed that he was able to combine some level of self-respect with being willingly humiliated, and maintained a properly submissive demeanor throughout. This was my first in-person meeting with a submissive I had encountered online, and I considered it successful.

      The lobby was well-lighted, but nearly empty as I walked across the thick carpet to the little stand where the hostess stood smiling. I told her the name of the man I was coming to join and then followed her through an arched doorway into the dining area. It was rather dark with small candles burning at the tables that gave an amber glow to the room. As we walked through the restaurant, I could sense that I was clearly drawing attention from men at many of the tables I passed, which always seems to happen in a very particular way whenever I am dressed in leather. It’s like they can’t help themselves, their expressions rather hypnotic and even surprised. More men in their heart of hearts are submissive than most people would ever imagine. And most of them would deny it with their last breath.  Then, at the rear of the dining room, I saw him. He was sitting alone with his back to the entrance as I had instructed and cradling a drink between his hands. The hostess walked to his table and extended her hand, saying, “Here you are. Enjoy your meal.” He didn’t move an inch, again following the instructions I had given him. I walked around to my seat facing him and stood staring down at him with absolutely no expression on my face.  “Well?” I said.  Immediately, he was all arms and legs as he slid his chair back and stood up, stepping quickly around to remove my coat. He pulled out my chair and waited for me to sit down. Then he scurried back to his place and hesitated for a moment.  “You can sit down, now,” I told him.  He had this funny way of bending forward as he sat so that he had to straighten up again and pull his chair closer to the table. When he was seated, I pulled out a cigarette and looked through my purse. But he immediately produced a lighter, so I allowed him to light my cigarette, then blew the smoke across the table toward him. It swirled through the beam of light above the candle and clouded our view of one another for a moment. Gradually the smoke began to clear and I could see that he was keeping his eyes cast down at the tablecloth.  “You can look at me now,” I said softy. And it was then that I watched his eyes lift up to make contact with mine, dilating for a split second as he saw for the first time what I looked like. I continued to stare, which I like to do in the beginning, just to see how the male will react. Usually, they break eye contact almost immediately, then try to steal quick glimpses after a moment. But in his case, he held my gaze, staring back into my eyes. This gave me quite an opportunity to see the expression in his eyes as they lightened a bit, then narrowed and started to focus on my face. I could see them move slightly as he looked at my hair and my nose and my lips. I could almost read his thoughts in the subtle movements of his eyes, and I let him look for a moment without saying anything. But I continued to smoke.  Finally, I took a last drag on my cigarette and dropped it into his drink. His eyes darted down to his glass as the hot end of the cigarette hissed and went out, and then he looked up suddenly to see our waiter standing next to him. I smiled as the waiter told us his name and handed us large menus, all the while looking at the wet cigarette but in the glass on the table.  Before leaving us to decide on our choices, he asked me, “Can I get you something from the bar? And to the man across from me: “Another drink for you, sir?”   “I’ll have a glass of white wine,” I said amiably, “but I don’t think the gentleman is quite finished with his drink yet.”  I enjoyed comparing the looks this got, both from the waiter and my new submissive.dining partner. Both were surprised, but one of them seemed confused and the other seemed embarrassed.  “You know, I think you had better finish that drink before he brings me my wine, I said softly.  He looked at me for a second too long, as if he weren’t quite sure I was serious. But I was very serious, and I told him so with a look firm enough that he picked up the glass and started to drink, ignoring the butt floating alongside his lips. He paused, and I smiled and nodded. He started drinking again, emptying the glass this time and setting it down rather too abruptly on the table and reached for a napkin to wipe his mouth, even though what needed wiping was on the inside.  “Don’t you think it would be rude to leave that wet cigarette butt in your glass for our waiter to take back? Why don’t you put it in your pocket?”  I couldn’t help but notice that his fingers were rather thick and clumsy as he fished for the but in the glass, pulling it in pieces and putting it into his shirt pocket, then wiping his hands on his napkin. Our waiter was back with my drink and asked if the ‘gentleman” would like another drink. He declined emphatically,  even though I said nothing. I picked up my menu when the waiter left, and so did he. After a moment, I closed mine and said quietly, “Be very careful what you order.”

      The inside of my car was crisp with the kind of cool air that shows your breath in cloud-like puffs as I drove through the light evening traffic to keep my engagement. I liked this kind of weather. It kept me cool and fresh for the meeting, and I knew I would have no problem heating things up after we met. The inside of my car smelled of leather and my perfume and it set my mind to thinking about the man I was going to see. This was always one of the most interesting aspects of the whole encounter, trying to guess what he would be like. Would he be so nervous that he would become inarticulate, or would he run of at the mouth and say things he would later regret? I remembered how one of my favorite slaves had been so worked up when he first met me that he said almost nothing. He would answer my questions with one-word replies and it seemed like I had to pull every statement out of his mouth one at a time. He was so frustrating to me, and so boring, that I nearly ended the meeting abruptly, never to see him again. But, even as I was becoming irritated and bored with his ineptitude, I was remembering some of the things he had said to me online--the reasons I had decided to meet with him in the first place--and I decided to give him a little more time. I'm glad I did, as it turned out, because he ended up working through his case of initial nerves and warmed up considerably over dinner. When he was finally able to speak more normally, I found him amusing and intriguing. And that was the beginning of a very rewarding series of encounters between us in which I found myself going to greater and greater lengths to expand his capacity for humiliation and physical punishment to the fullest extent he could bear. These memories warmed me considerably and set me to thinking about man who was now waiting in the restaurant for me to arrive. As I pulled into the parking lot and eased into a parking space, I was ready. I reached up and turned my rear-view mirror slightly so that I could check my appearance. My eyes burned with that glow that I have been told by many a male penetrated his soul. Now we would see what this submissive has to offer. I opened my door and stepped out of the car, my spike heels striking the pavement as I rose to my feet and walked purposefully toward the front door. Something told me this particular male had no idea what kind of world he was about to enter. He had better be ready for me. He might just get everything he was anticipating and a little bit more than he had imagined in his pathetic little fantasies. That thought brought a smile to my lips--a smile that curled ever-so-slightly into a sneer as I opened the door of the restaurant.

        I had met him online, so I knew a little more and a little less about him than someone I’d met first in person. I knew what he did for a living and what he was seeking from a mistress. I knew about some of the bad experiences he’d had with other women. I knew what excited him and what he was afraid to try. I knew he had a quick wit and a good sense of humor, and that he was a good speller. And we had exchanged photos on line, so I knew what he looked like. But I had never looked into his eyes and read the slumber there that all Dominant Women love to see in a male’s gaze. I hadn’t yet seen the way he moved when he walked or looked at the shape of his fingers. I hadn’t seen him tremble at the sound of my voice, or watched him get excited as I told him to kneel at my feet. I am always hard put to describe to another woman what kind of man I am seeking. His looks are so important to me, but they are not the looks that most of the Dommes I know are drawn to. It’s not that I’m immune to traditionally handsome men, but that kind of thing isn’t what means most to me. I want someone whose body moves easily, with an obviously masculine grace. I want someone whose face mirrors his emotions, especially those emotions which reflect submission, humility, distress, fear, self-abasement, hurt, shock, humor, alertness and sexual passion, because he is going to go through these emotions in my presence and I want to be able to experience the fullest sense of what he is feeling. That’s what turns me on, what makes me want to dominate. He can be tall or short, thin or a little heavy, muscular or pathetically underdeveloped, balding or sporting a full head of hair—it doesn’t really matter to me. But he has to have that look that allows me to penetrate to the depths of his being when I look at him. There are other things too, but those are at the top of my list. So my curiosity was gnawing away at my mind as I dressed for our first actual meeting. Would he be nervous and withdrawn, or nervous and outspoken? Would he be too afraid to speak freely and force me to do most of the talking? Or would he be open and get over his jitters quickly and begin to really interact with me? But most of all, I wondered, would he have that look, that special look that excites me as soon as I see it--the look of a man who wants to be my total slave. I took a lot of time preparing myself for his first sight of me. I’d had my hair and nails done earlier that day, and now I was painstakingly applying my makeup to give my face the exact image I wanted to portray. Then I slipped into black lingerie and silky stockings with a black garter belt. I pulled on my highest-heeled boots with pointed toes that gleamed and wiggled my toes. Then I stepped into a soft, black leather skirt that came just to my knees and hugged against my legs capturing my movements with reflections of light. I slipped my arms into a red silk blouse and fastened the pearl buttons, then tucked it into my waistband, smoothing it against my body and turning to admire myself in the mirror. Then I pulled on my long leather coat and picked up my purse and my leather gloves and walked out the door into the cool evening air. I was ready for him to see me now, and I was curious as I drove to the restaurant about what kind of man I would find waiting for me tonight.

         Relationships with other females had always been rather bittersweet for me.  As a budding dominant adolescent with overworked hormones, I found it difficult to relate completely to other girls.  When they were giggling about making out in the back seat of some boy’s car, I felt distanced by my own fantasies that ran more to tying them up and punishing them, which of course I couldn’t reveal.  So I’m sure I always seemed a little withdrawn from the other girls.  But that was before I met Katherine.  Not Kathy or Katy or Kat or any of the other nicknames, she was always Katherine, no matter how well you got to know her.  When I first met her, I thought she was a little bit arrogant and haughty, and I was right.  In fact, I was prepared to dislike her, but I found myself more intrigued than irritated, especially when I watched her around boys.  She spoke to them in the way I had imagined myself doing in my daydreams, but never in reality.  So, needless to say, I managed to get better acquainted with her.  Those were days when the concept of female domination was not spoken of, and a teenage girl who came across as strong and forceful was considered to be a bitch and/or a slut.  I knew that, even though I was different, that there had to be a way for me to express who I really was and how I really felt.  Meeting Katherine was like an acknowledgement of all the things I had kept to myself.  At first, she was a little stand-offish, but I think she began to sense a kinship in me, because she started to open up quickly.  Soon we were inseparable and we would go off by ourselves and just talk.  We talked about the things that would be important only to two young, dominant females, and it was so freeing to have someone who could understand my feelings.  So we were together throughout high school.  We were joined by other girls at times, but never for very long.  We were just too different from the others.  They began to refer to us as “Bitch One” and “Bitch Two.”  And the boys often just referred to us as “The Ballbusters.”  Did that offend us?  On the contrary, we loved it.  But after graduation, Katherine and I went away to different schools.  We phoned each other and got together on holidays and sometimes during the summer, but we started to live different lives.  We’ve always managed to keep in touch, however, and whenever we spoke or emailed one another, the closeness was always still there.  But then, after so many years had passed, last spring Katherine called me and I invited her for a visit.  She is Lady Katherine these days, and she lives in Savannah in an actual southern mansion and she has begun to develop a bit of a southern drawl. We agreed that she would join me for a couple of weeks in the summer.   I was so excited I didn’t know where to begin my preparations, and I had just over a week to get ready for her.  It was as though I were going to meet a long lost sister. Katherine also informed me she that she would  be bringing jimmy, her slave, and I was looking forward to their visit. We had shared so much in our emails and phone conversations over the years, that I felt as if I couldn't know her anymore personally. I was delighted to have her actually coming here for a visit.

         What do Dommes talk about when they are together, away from submissive males? Well, women’s stuff of course. But they also talk about what gripes them most in the males who scramble for their attention. And right up there with the most complained-about issues is the slave who says he has no limits. In the first place, it smacks of arrogance, which is not very promising in a slave. But, even more, it seems either dishonest or stupid for any male to claim not to have limits. In fact, some Dommes won’t even consider talking to a man who makes such a claim. Others deal with it quickly by subjecting him to a taste of something so frightening or painful that he will be shocked into the realization that his claim was a little foolhardy. The very fact that I have seen men come to me confident in their abilities to accept and endure any kind of treatment I can dole out, and yet these same men have been reduced to literal tears, begging and imploring me to stop, make me smile when I hear these “No Limits” claims. If you haven’t really thought this through, take some time to do so. You need to become clear about what you think you want, what you think you can tolerate, and what you would be willing to explore. Then you need to give some real thought to things that may be too painful or frightening or emotionally disturbing. You need to consider your physical health and stamina and you need to examine your psychological feelings about some of these issues. Any Domme worth becoming involved with will be interested in discussing your limitations with you because, even if she is a Sadist who dearly loves inflicting pain and degradation, she does not want to seriously harm you physically or emotionally. That kind of harm is no longer dominance, but abuse.

         What's the point of email training? After all, you can't smell or taste or feel the person you are interacting with. Isn't it just an inferior attempt at something which can't really be approximated via email? These are the kinds of comments I have seen repeatedly condemning the concept of training someone by email as ineffective and pointless. Yet it is engaged in every day by thousands of dominant women and submissive males. Why? What are they getting out of it? If we look back into history, we find that many of the most passionate exchanges between men and women took place in correspondence--love letters, if you will. There were no photographs or video cameras or audio possibilities in these letters, but they still were often so powerful that they remained as vivid memories of feelings years after they were first read. In fact, what is the validity of written erotica, since it is only a stimulus for the imagination and lacks any sensory input? What about photographs? Why are men so aroused by looking at what is merely a static, two-dimensional image? Or videos, which can move and carry sound, but lack touch and the other personal kinds of interaction? The answer is that the basis for all sexuality, but especially for Dominance and submission, is in the mind. What is most important to a Domme: Adonis-like looks or a truly submissive heart and mind? And how many submissive males would prefer a woman whose appearance was right out of his intensest fantasies to one whose mind thrilled him with the intricacies of the thought processes of a dominant female? That mental factor is the driving force behind all dominant/submissive interaction, even those which take place in physical reality, and that mental factor is also very possible to capture and maintain throughout an interactive email training program.

         Do You Have to Be Attractive to Find a Domme? I know it’s hard enough to find a Dominant Woman to serve that it’s easy to become discouraged. But what if you are not very attractive? Does that make it completely hopeless? First, let me ask you, when you are with your male friends and you see a woman walk by whom you find attractive, do all your friends agree? Or are there some who like them a little bigger-chested, or longer-legged, or taller, or shorter, or a blonde or a redhead or more slender or with a little more meat on her bones? Even among males, who are so much more visually-oriented when it comes to sexual attraction than women, there are varying tastes and preferences. Well women are far more diverse in their tastes than men. They can be attracted to a man because of his voice or his eyes or his smile or his sense of humor or the way he walks his dog. So there are so many ways in which a man may be attractive to a woman that a lot of you who feel unattractive may not seem so to a woman. Then there is the fact that she is Dominant. She may not even care about whether her slave is attractive, as long as he is obedient and serves her to her satisfaction. Some Dommes don’t really look at a slave as a man when they are dominating him. What they see is simply a lower being whose only purpose and value is to serve her and obey her. Therefore, when she is disciplining him or ordering him to lick her boots, it is not important to her whether or not she finds him physically attractive.

         My Feet Sometimes I suspect that I would have a foot fetish if I were a male. I think of my own feet as soft and sensuous and I enjoy pampering them and decorating them with different kinds of nail polish and toe rings. I soften them with lotions and various foot cosmetics, have commercial and amateur pedicures, and I love to admire them both bare and in the silkiest of stockings. So it’s no wonder that I consider my feet an object worthy of worship by mere males. I expect to have a lot of attention paid to my feet, massaging and rubbing them with all kinds of creams. I also fully expect that any male with an ounce of testosterone will find them exciting and sexy to look at and touch. I expect him to become enthralled at the idea of smelling and kissing them. Even more interesting is the fact that my feet are one of my strongest erogenous zones. It’s almost as if they were wired to send sexual electricity flowing up my legs and throughout my body when they are being caressed. But not all of these feelings are completely physical. Some are more mental, in keeping with my Dominant personality. As a Dominant Woman, I also like the fact that my feet are the lowest part of my body, the part that touches the ground. I like the fact that I can wear boots and walk through dirt and mud with my feet and then have a naked slave become excited when I order him to lick them clean. I love the times when my feet sweat in boots all day, and then I sit back while my slave removes them and smells the odor of my foot sweat and worships them with his lips and tongue. I love the feel of stepping on pliant flesh with bare feet or wearing shoes, and feeling the flesh give way under the pressure of my weight. I love to see the look in a slave’s eyes as he lays on the floor with my foot on his face and stares up at me in awe and adoration. And, during my more sadistic moods, I enjoy the power of my feet, using them to trample and stomp and kick my slave. One thing is inevitable for any male who becomes involved with me: he will come to know my feet intimately. One submissive told me that he came to consider my feet to be alive with a personality and a will of their own, and that will and personality were so powerful that he became obsessed with them, thinking about the way they felt and looked and, of course smelled, even while he was at work. I considered that to be a compliment that sometimes earned him the privilege of licking between my toes and other times the honor of being allowed to clean the soles of my shoes with his mouth.

         PAIN AND THE submissive male Pain is like the room in Orwell's "1984," where each person finds his own nightmare. I would even argue that there is such a wide disparity between subs in tolerance for pain, that it can have no universal constants. Some seem able to endure tremendous physical discipline with a relatively small degree of discomfort. But others experience terrific anguish with punishments which seem rather mild. For some, the degree of pain inflicted seems only a symbol for the degree of power exchange experienced. Many times, this pain is engulfed entirely in endorphins and ecstatic emotional/sexual experience, and not experienced as pain at all. For still others, certain forms of humiliation and degradation are far more unbearable than physical torture. But, then, I enjoy exploring these tolerances and weaknesses, so that I may exploit them fully in the exercise of My Total Dominance of the submissive. Whatever I discover his limits to be, I will respect them, toy with them, and absolutely expand them so that he will retain nothing that in any way allows him to be anything other than my abject slave.

         As many of you know, I have several yahoo groups of my own and I am a member of a few others. I have been reading how the act of domination is not sexual and not the main motivation. This comes from self proclaimed dommes who put the word Mistress, Goddess or Lady in front of some ridiculous made up name. I am Dominant. I find the act of dominating a male to be totally sexual, so it irks me to hear the constant complaining of women that the men who contact them are thinking with their genitals. What a surprise! Isn't that what makes the world go around? And what else is it that would compel a man to give over his power and dignity completely to a woman? Some kind of noble advocacy of feminist principles? They submit because the excitement of giving themselves over to the absolute domination of a woman is so thrilling and so fulfilling that they not only enjoy it, they crave it and would do nearly anything to have this feeling. That sounds pretty sexual to me. I am convinced that the men who claim to desire to submit to a woman out of some kind of philosophical conviction are only trying desperately to say whatever they think a dominant woman wants to hear, trying not to offend them. And they are right, that is exactly what a lot of women, who call themselves Mistress This and Goddess That, want to hear. The kind of women who claim that they are dominant for other reasons than sex which have to do with control or wanting males to do things for them. I don't think it rings true, probably because it's so vague and unclear. To me it's not vague at all. I do this because it turns me on. When I hear a man say that it turns him on, it make sense to me. When I hear a woman say it doesn't turn her on, it makes sense, too. Only I don't think she's dominant. She may be aggressive and pushy and want to portray herself as a Domme, maybe as a way to make money. Maybe as a way to meet men. I don't know. But I do know they aren't like me, and I consider myself to be absolutely dominant. So, if I were a submissive male, would I find myself biting my tongue and going through all kinds of verbal contortions to declare that my interest in serving is platonic? I hope I wouldn't be so desperate that I would suck up to somebody who isn't even interested in dominating me in the way I want to be dominated. What's the value in that? Having the illusion of conversing with a Domme? I guess I'm in the minority, based on the number of posts I read from women claiming to be dominant, but if you are confused by them and find them hard to understand, don't feel bad. I am a Domme, and I don't understand them either.

         I like to think that anyone reading this already knows that thing which certain men yearn to experience with a special type of woman.  I mean, let's face it, the concept of submitting to a woman's absolute control and even to her cruelty is something that most people in our patriarchal society would find disturbing and impossible to understand.   But it isn't those vanilla people I'm addressing with this article.  I'm speaking to those who feel the powerful urge to experience this kind of activity.  Many feel that Dominant Females are mythical creatures, as imaginary as unicorns, created in fantasy by males who long to submit to such a woman. In many ways there is some truth to this, in the sense that many women have adopted fantasy titles and fetish attire in an effort to portray the Dominatrix for hire as a means of earning money.  And many women occasionally engage in sexual role play that includes the Queen or Female Prison Guard or some other variation on the theme.  But are these women actually dominant?  Probably not.  Do Dominant Women actually exist?  There are far more of us than you would believe, though not nearly so many of us as you might hope. My awareness of Female Domination came to me as a very young girl.  I had secret fantasies of tormenting men, of ordering them about as slaves.  Of course, these fantasies were private, and I never shared them with anyone.Whenever I began to think of these things, I experienced a quivering excitement that, since I hadn't reached puberty, I did not associate with sexuality.  Yet it was sexual.  Sexual in some strange, profound way that touched the very depths of my psyche.But since no one ever talked of Female Domination when I was growing up, Thought I was just peculiar, odd, strange, and even somehow twisted.  I knew that I was always very aware of, and never confused about, exactly what I wanted. This kind of clarity about my desires made it inevitable that I always seemed to try to get my way.  I recognized that this aspect of my nature made me rather strong-willed and confrontational, taking great delight in imposing my will on those who seemed weaker.  Back then, no one called me dominant.  They called me a brat, and later on they called me a bitch.  But there was more to it than that.  There was something in me that made me feel superior to males, something that yearned to control them, to humiliate them and even to hurt them.  It became obvious, finally, that the motivation was primarily sexual.  But it's hard to be dominant in a vacuum.  A partner, or a subject, or an object, or a victim is necessary.  Personally, I like to think of myself as being strong enough to dominate most any male, but that is not perfectly true.No, it is a certain kind of male who is destined to submit to me, and I have an infallible internal mechanism that allows me to spot these men almost instantly.  It shows in the eyes most strongly, and it cannot be disguised or hidden from someone like me.  Once selected, the prospective submissive is no more than just a candidate,someone with potential that I have recognized.  But this is only the beginning of the process of turning him into my slave.  The process is slow and both unimaginably thrilling and incredibly uncomfortable for him.  He must be shown things about his own capacity for submitting to my absolute authority that he would never even dream he possessed.  He will grow inwardly in ways that will teach him more about his desires than he ever knew.  He will come to love things that he hates and love submitting to any and every discomfort and indignity for no greater reason than to please me.  And he will become addicted to the process of becoming.  What he is becoming will be something of a mystery to him in the beginning, but he will grow to crave it more than he understands   it.In the end, Female Domination is the ultimate interaction between She Who Must Be Obeyed and he who must obey.  There is no greater fulfillment possible for him than knowing that the woman he has submitted to is genuinely and sincerely dominant.  She is not acting or playing a role. She just is.

        I love lies. Bold lies with voluptuous details that furnish me with tidbits that I can use as building blocks in erecting new fantasies. But the kind of lies I like most are those that are filled with truth. Lies that are so filled with truth that they are more truthful than most of the veracious things we hear. If that sounds like double-talk, keep reading, and I’ll show you what I mean.There is also a kind of lie that invariably begins by irritating me, continues to irritate me, and finally sends me into a tooth-gnashing rage. It's the kind that purports to be truthful in the way that TV commercials use actors in white lab coats to tell you about some over-the-counter pain reliever.I came across a website, allegedly written by a dominant woman with some kind of nebulous credentials as a psycho-therapeutic counselor to men who long to turn their vanilla wives into whip-wielding viragos. The guys being targeted are inextricably yoked to the kind of women who become uncomfortable when their husbands kiss their feet and who think that provocative lingerie or spike heeled shoes belong only on street walkers. So here are all these submissive men whose heads are filled with mental pictures of all kinds of kinky things they wish their wives would do to them being zeroed in on by this promise of a scientific technique that will kindle the hidden passions of these women and bring the inner dominatrix to the surface. And these men so want to believe this woman, if she is a woman, which I am not convinced is the case, that they will spend money for some kind of counseling process that is certain to have her wearing skin-tight leather in no time.Part of the system involves this Therapist/Domme engaging in various sexual acts as she probes his psyche with invasive questions about his life and his submissive longings. Then she types up a report of her findings and introduces herself to the wife, announcing that she has startling information that will breathe new life into her marriage.Now I know that the blood drain from the brain to the erection often leads to faulty reasoning in a frustrated male, but this whole scenario is so ridiculous that I can't see how they can fall for it. I can just see Mrs. Vanilla Housewife answer the door to some pretentious woman with a report that reveals that her husband wants to be her toilet slave. There's nothing wrong with the guy having fantasies about “What if my wife actually changed and started to dominate me?” It's kind of like the stories in the back of Hustler where men tell about being captured by depraved college cheerleaders and forced into outrageous sexual acts. These are just stupid stroke stories. They never happened. No one expects you to believe that they really happened. Furthermore, the writer isn't claiming to offer a system that will tell men how to be kidnapped by cheerleaders and turned into a love slave. I appreciate a good lie as much as the next girl, but bad lies give me the kind of inspiration I never need for being a bitch.
