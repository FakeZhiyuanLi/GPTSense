      The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but shorter tempers, wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints. We spend more, buthave less, we buy more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness.  &nbsp;  We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.  &nbsp;  We've learned how to make a living, but not a life. We've added years to life not life to years. We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not inner space. We've done larger things, but not better things.  &nbsp;  We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait. We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.  &nbsp;  These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships. These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, toquiet, to kill. It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete.  &nbsp;  Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever. Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side. Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent. &nbsp; Remember, to say, "I love you" to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you. Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person will not be there again. Give time to love, give time to speak, and give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind.  &nbsp;  Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.

      Every weekday, I make a trip to office and to home. Every weekday, I face the horrible experience of a traffic jam in the city. A trip that would've taken only 15 minutes ends up taking almost 45 minutes all because of the daily crawls on the road. During these traffic jams, emotions tend to run high. Drivers get frustrated and angry. These particular individuals have at times demonstrated how at times drivers have little patience on the road. Take for example, you will see people moving from one lane to another just to be a little faster by a distance of 1 or 2 cars. There are also moments when you see drivers refusing to give way to others, this usually happens on a roundabout and sometimes causes what is known as a "gridlock effect". Did I forget to mention that drivers with big vehicles, especially buses, lorries and trucks, tend to use their size advantage to deliberately force their way into another lane.  On the worst case scenario, some drivers lose their steam and take the law into their own hands. I've read many cases on the newspaper, in fact I've seen some myself, drivers coming out of their vehicles, armed with iron rods or sticks, just to beat up each other. Sometimes these fights tend to get really bloody and both individuals end up hospitalized.  Really, if only everyone drives in the proper manner and adheres to the law, I believe Malaysian roads wouldn't be so unsafe. Goodness, the accident ratio against the population is rated as one of the highest in the world. The number of accidents and fatalities would've been significantly reduced. But, sad as it is, the bad drivers culture is set in so deeply within the community that only a miracle of sorts will bring a change in the mindsets of these drivers.

      Today is probably one of the most feared days for everyone in my office. Auditors from the Quality Assurance and HSE Dept are invading the office. Personally, I've never liked auditors in general because they are paid to find faults on other people's jobs. Think about it, the company gives a license to someone to dig into your working life and find mistakes and faults. Ugh! They literally cause distraction while you're busy working all because they need to ask some questions on your job and "How Well You Know What You're Supposed To Be Doing?". At times the auditors can be unreasonable, liek asking "Excuse me, but I have to interrupt you now" when I am in the middle of solving a critical problem. Doh! Can't they see I am busy, go find someone else to annoy and leave me alone.  But then, if given much thought, without Auditors the corporate world will be in serious trouble.  I have to admit that Auditors see things from a birds eye view, things that we the field experts ourselves are unable to see due to our narrow minded brains. Yes, its true that we are humans who make mistakes and have a tendency to break the rules and instructions set forth. Auditors kind of points out those mistakes we make and at times can advice us on how to resolve it.  I'm lucky I wasn't given the interrogation by the Auditors today. But tomorrow will be another day these "Interrogators from QA Dept" will be visiting the IT Dept. I sure hope they will ignore me and leave me alone peacefully to my work *Crosses Fingers*.

      Today will be the beginning of what I would call a journey of sharing of my own personal experiences each day. I'm introduced to the term Blogging by my friend, Celine, whom has her own Blog at http://www.celineyap.com . I've never imagined that the day will come when people will begin to openly share their day-to-day experiences and comments to the world through an online website. Whoever invented the concept of Blogging Online, I have to give my applause to the individual for this great idea. I suppose the technology is there and there are keen viewers all over the world, I may as well join the crowd and have some fun of my own! Let the sharing begin!!!
