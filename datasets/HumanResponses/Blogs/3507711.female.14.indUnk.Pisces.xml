The Unnamed REALLY pointless story  There once lived a man named sdjkjkadl, people always made fun of sdjkjkadl because he had a funny name.   Muskrats  The Muskrat named Turkey decided he wanted to be THE Turkey because his name was turkey. Turkey went to the magic bull frog and asked to be a turkey, poof he was a turkey. Turkey had forgotten how much he liked to eat turkey. Turkey soon ate all his turkey friends and then started gnawing on his turkey leg, despite the pain it tasted delicious. Like turkey.   RED   (This story is from [episode 5] www.big-bunny.com)   There was once a red squirrel he had many enemies. One evening he invited them all to dinner. He served red meat, red wine and red gelatin for dessert. Then the squirrel and his associates closed and locked all the doors , chop chop chop went the squirrel slice slice slice went his associates. Soon the white hall was red red red. When it was finished he ground up the remains and baked a big red PIE. He sent pieces of the pie in red packages to all those who declined his invitation. And the red red squirrel lived a happy and trouble free life until he was grey grey grey.
