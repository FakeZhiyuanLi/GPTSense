      OK, so I know that a president's funeral is a bigger event than, say, 3,000 Iraqi civilians dying in a bombing raid, but still, WHY do they have to devote about 15 TV channels to live coverage, depriving sad little stay-at-home Mommys like me of our Dr Phil?  It seems that he was fairly decent as a person, even though he wrecked the economy and invented the truly nasty trickle-down economics theory (I've always though of that as huge fat pigs scoffing at a table, and the more food is on the table, the more likely that a few crumbs might accidentally fall onto the floor for the starving mice below.  Because you can be absolutely sure that the pigs won't knowingly let anything drop), but it amazes me that he seems to inspire such devotion, just because he had a nifty way with a comb and a cheeky grin.    Seems so sad that Clinton, who did such amazing things for the economy, will be remembered for getting a blow job off a needy intern, while Reagan is seen as this historic figure already.  Go figure.

      Little A went to sleep at 5:45 last night, which was wonderful and gave me and C some much-needed alone time (no sex though, just Oreos, milk and TV, and lots of giggling).  It meant though that she woke up ludicrously early this morning...around 3.  I just got up half asleep, changed her stinking diaper, and took her to bed with me and we nursed and slept together until 7.  I love it when we do that, and I think she does too, although I'm glad that she mostly sleeps in her crib.  There's nothing like waking up next to her, though; feeling her little warm body snuggled up next to me.  I'd worry about squashing her if it wasn't for the fact that I'm a completely motionless sleeper - I always wake in exactly the position I went to sleep in.  So then C went to work and little A and I played for an hour or so.  She rolled over a couple of times, and stroked and attempted to eat her big lilac teddy.  I dressed her in about 3 outfits like a little doll, then settled on one that includes a cute little hairband for her blonde fuzz, and now she's in her swing while I check email and take a shower.  So in 5 minutes I have managed to break 3 of the cardinal rules that while pregnant I was so sure I never would.  All I have to do to complete my felonies is to put her in her swing  in front of the TV .

      Hello Pip,  This morning was another one of those scenes where if you'd shown me what I'd be doing now in a crystal ball a few years ago I'd have fallen over in shock and quite possibly killed myself.  Actually, more likely I'd have rolled a joint, that was my reaction to most occurrences.  Julia's friend from Buffalo is still here and we were planning on breakfast at the regular hangout (the confusingly accented and spelt Caffé O'Lé), then Lydia called me yesterday and asked whether she and Lesley and Lesley's kids could join us.  Like I would mind.  Really, sometimes Lydia's excessive politeness and consideration grates a bit.  Anyhow, seeing Lesley again was great (last time I saw her I'd just given birth and she was a student in the OB section - she was very sweet and reassuring about the baby questions I asked).  I couldn't help but notice again how utterly plain she is compared to her rather dazzling husband, and her two gorgeous sons look just like him.  I remember having met him via Lydia, then discovering independently that he was married to Lesley and being rather taken aback.  Anyway, breakfast was delish and passed in a flurry of gossip, baby talk, Lydia 'accidentally' dropping into the conversation her child psychology degree (she does this whenever she meets anyone new, in this case Julia's friend, and I almost had a bet with Julia that she would oblige today, but Julia wasn't playing - she's not stupid, she knew it was a certainty and wasn't keen to lose $$$).  The sproglet didn't nap before we left the house this morning so she was a bit grizzley as I knew she would be, and Lydia sympathised loudly and unnecessarily several times, in order to call attention to her happy smiley baby, snuggled in her lap.  She does this whenever possible in a terribly faux-modest way ("I'm so lucky, he's just a happy baby" {looks sympathetically at me}).  It doesn't bother me a bit, although it does make me cringe.  Little A does everything before him, and Lydia, while professing patience and acknowledgment of the differing speeds of development of perfectly normal children (she knows, you see, she has a degree in child psychology, did I mention that?), cannot handle this fact at all.    I should say for the record that I adore Lydia and I'm sure that she's just as painfully aware of my idiosyncrasies as I am hers, but this is my blog, so this is where it's poor old her who'll daily get cat scratches.  Oh well.   Another recurring conversational gambit from Lydia is casually mentioning that I had an epidural, having wanted a natural childbirth, and after she advised me (having given birth 5 days earlier) that I would be crazy not to get one, and that I was 'doing everything right', while she was throwing caution to the wind and co-sleeping and demand-feeding her son through the night (this almost always comes up around the same point as the "I'm so lucky, happy baby" comments, and the sympathetic looks at my over-achieving but vocal progeny).  She didn't disappoint, and Julia and I were able to exchange gently amused glances when the anticipated lines were spoken.  So it was a fairly typical Mommy club breakfast, in short.
