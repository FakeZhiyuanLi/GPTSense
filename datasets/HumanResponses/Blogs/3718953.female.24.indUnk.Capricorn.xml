						    Today, find your story's hero, or heroine. Ask your character:  "How do you see yourself?"    The answer will be your character's sense of identity. Perhaps  the answer will be: adventurer, mother, caretaker, gangster,  computer genius, detective, athlete, beauty queen, teacher, great  lover, movie star, doctor ---   Write 250 words from your character's journal. Begin: "Today, I -  --"  	Today I woke up at 5:00am because this was the day that Flannery was going to let me clear out his factory. That was at least 200 pallets. At $3 a pallet, I stood to make some good money. I know that at least of $50 of that would go into the gas tank, but after that I would have some dough to take Marcy out on the town tonight. I hate dragging pallets around. I hate loading them on my truck. I think of Jada and I continue to work fueled by hatred. It was her fault that I was tossing pallets into the flatbed of my truck and later in the afternoon I would be taking some Aleve and toasting my water to the fact that I was not going to give her one penny of my money.  	She threw herself on me that night. I went to the club with my friends and she wanted to take me home. A month and a half later when she came up pregnant, what did she expect me to do? Was I supposed to include her in my life? That was not going to happen. That night was just two people trying to have some fun. There was going to be no marriage. On top of that I didn’t think it was my responsibility to take care of the kid. I wanted to be in the kids’ life because I believe there is nothing worse that you could do to a kid than strip it of a parent.  	Then there was the lawsuit and the court order telling me how much I would have to pay in child support. There was no way that I was going to give up a car payment a month to pay for a kid that was not my responsibility.

						    What do you want? Start your log by choosing a writing goal.  First, list at least five goals. Choose one, and write 200 words about this goal. Why is it important to you?	  Submit three stories by the end of the year. Get published somewhere Write five pages everyday except Wednesday Find some reliable free editors Take a class  	Submitting three stories this year is so important to me because that is how I am going to be able to get my stuff out there. I have to let things go. I submitted and got rejected and I have yet to get back on the horse. I need to jump back on and be confident that I am going to get published somewhere. That is what I need to do. I need to put myself out there and see what happens. I am not going to get published waiting for someone to talk to me and ask me if I have something that they can read. That is not my plan anyways. Every day that I don’t have anything out is a day I feel like I am not making progress in this writing game. I don’t know how else to describe what I feel. It is important to me to make sure that I make progress.  	I want to put my stuff out there and see if I can get the same response or If I am improving. There are times when I think that my writing is getting worse. There is part of me that thinks that I need to take a break, but that is not the answer. I have to keep writing.

						   Today, write a poem, of at least 20 lines. Your poem can be about anything you please. :-)    I am not black like you  I am black like me That is probably what you could not see When you look across the room and see me I am not black like you  I am black like me  Its probably better that you think  That I am Latin or Italian Because then maybe you would not think so much That my blackness can not be found in my lips Or in my nose Because that is what you are talking about When you say black like me Maybe my glasses hide my blackness Being black like me doesn’t always have the exterior of a Zulu warrior I am not black like you  Cause I am black like me And let me remind you That there are 31 shades and colors or black So there are at least 30 shades of folks  Who are not black like you And there are at least 30 shades of folks  Who are not black like me also

						   	I am frightened that when people read my writing, they will think that something about my writing is me. That would be true. I am afraid that they would see something bad in the characters and think it is me. I am afraid that people would think that I am a pervert. I am afraid that people that I don’t like would realize throught reading my work how much I don’t like them.  I am afraid of hurting my wife and my mom. I am afraid that people will read my writing and tell me that I cannot write very well. I am afraid that they will tell me that I am not as gifted as I think that I am. They will tell me that I am a hack writer who doesn’t know what he is doing. I am afraid that people are going to read my stories and question whether it will be published. They will wonder who would buy a book with this story in it.  	I am afraid that editors and people who know something about writing will tell me to give it up. I think that would hurt, but then again it would be helpful so that I could move on with my life. I could focus on just reading and becoming some kind of bookworm. I could focus on becoming a coach or something like that. Maybe then I would be more than motivated to go back to school and figure out what to do with my life. Maybe I would be a driven business man then.

						    Today, write 200 words, beginning with: "If I were honest with my  partner (or best friend), I would tell him/ her that ----"  	If I were honest with my partner, I would tell her that I am fighting to be the husband and father that I am supposed to be. I would tell her how I feel like I am inevitably and tragically heading towards the marriages that I grew up watching. Marriages with lots of distance and things unsaid. I don’t want the distance as much as I want the time that I need to help me be me. I require a lot and I cannot lie about that. As much as I know that those marriages are bad, I envy the space. I envy the ability to do things and not have to have my wife around. I envy my wife having things to do that don’t require me to be there with her. My wife doesn’t have enough things that she doesn’t feel like she needs me there just to be there.  	One of my problem is that I feel like there is so much that I need to do. I have to write and read and all the other things that I need to do. I know it is a lot and I am ok with that. No matter what I am doing, I feel like there is five other things that I could be doing. If I am writing a story, there is five other stories that I could be working on.

						   You're a doctor. You've just received the test results for a patient. The patient has a disease for which there is no cure. You need to break the news to your patient.  	Being a doctor for seven years had taught Jeff  one thing more than any other; life is way too short. He had been a pediatrician all seven years and he chose pediatrics because he knew that the odds were that he would less deaths than being some other kind of doctor. He did see less than his friends who branched off into different fields and specialties. Yet when he had one, they were more tragic because there was something with a child dying. The idea was as foreign as old people running the marathon. 	“Where am I heading?” he asked Mandy 	“Room 2...I have already gone through the initial stuff. They have been waiting the longest.” 	“Where are the Samuels?” 	“Room 4” 	“Ok I will see them next.

						   You're not a gambler and you've never bought a lottery ticket. One day, just for the heck of it, you decide to buy a ticket.  A week later, you're alone in your apartment when the phone rings. You've won ten million dollars.  You.  Write around 500 words. Make the story funny --- or touching, your choice.   	Isnt this what you have always thought about. I know that it had run through my head a couple of times. I would think about it like it was inevitable. Not inevitable enough to buy a ticket. Enough to figure out how to figure out what I would do with this money. 	No I am not going to quit my job. Its only $10 million. That means I will get somewhere between $6 million & $7million. I didn’t want to change a lot about the way that lived. I just wanted my income without wasting time at work.  	“Sir...are you there?”   	I am frightened. What if everyone finds out that I have this money. My phone will never stop ringing.  	“Sir” 	“Yeah” 	“You are Phinehas Samuels?” 	“Yes” 	“You have the ticket” 	“Wait let me go get it.” I run through my closet to look for those faded jeans. After looking on top of the nightstand, there was no other place that it could be besides in the pants that I wore that day. I hoped that I had not thrown them into the laundry yet. 	“Ok...I got the ticket.” 	“Can you read the numbers?” 	“Yes...3...29...1...9...11...24.” 	“We need you to come in with the ticket at your earliest conveinience.” 	“I got a question.” 	“Yes” 	“When you publish the winner, can I give you another name?” 	“If you would like?”   	“Samuels....come in here.” I knew that wasn’t going to get through all of this without having a talk with Mr. Nixon. I take my time finishing the sentence that I was working on and make my way into his office. He had and antique church pew in his office that those who came to visit him had to sit in.  	“Please take a seat Phin.” He held his smile for two seconds and then his scowl came back. 	“So you are leaving us?” 	“Yes sir...I need to do something else in life.” 	“You got another job lined up?” 	“No sir” 	“Well...what are you plans?” 	“I don’t really know.” I think I should have made up something because then he got paranoid. 	“You are not going to become my competition are you Samuels?” 	“No!” 	“That’s good because if you did, I would sue you so quickly that you would never get off of the ground with all the legal fees that you would be paying.” That sounded like a challenge.  	“Sir...I want to do something new.” I tried to keep my cool. 	“I like you Samuels because I know that I can push your buttons.” What was I supposed to do with this? He leaned back in his chair and put his feet on his desk. “You’re a fighter, but just remember that I am a better fighter.” 	I had no plan to be competition until he took me in his office. That night I came up with the plan

						    Today, write 200 words, beginning with: "If I were honest with  myself, I would tell myself that ----	  	If I were honest with myself, I would tell myself that I am falling into the absolute worst shape of my life. I am getting a gut and I am not the athlete that I once was. I cannot remember the last time that I played a sport that even made me sweat. It is kind of sad. One of the things that I have decided to do is to make sure that I am  in the best shape of my life by the time that I am 30. Well I have 10 months to go and Ithink that there is a lot to do. My curse is that I can easily get in shape. At least I have been able to in the past. But I am older now and I think things only get harder from here on out. It is better that I try to do this now instead of trying to do it at 35 and 40. I think that it would be much harder. I have tried this South Beach Diet and I appreciate the way that it has changed what I eat. I have found some healthy alternatives to what I want to eat usually. Diet is not enough. I need to get int he gym. I need a membership and I need to work.

						   You're driving home from a day in the country, alone. Miles from anywhere, your engine splutters, coughs and dies. The headlights fade. You pull over to the shoulder. The battery's flat in your cell phone.  You.  Write around 500 words, telling us what happens next.   	“This is a really bad time for this to happen!” I yelled. 	I was mad about everything. I was mad that it was night and my car died on some country road. I was mad because I was listening to the Joshua Tree CD and I was getting into With or Without You when the car died. I was mad because I had a hankering for Chinese food and I was nowhere to the city. I didn’t think that I would find any pan fried noodles hanging from any of the trees out here. There was definitely a possibility that I would find a fig or an avocado. I would not be hungry but I would still be longing for the noodles. 	The battery was not supposed to have problems. I had it changed out three weeks ago. Byung assured me that I shouldn’t have any problems with the battery for at least two or three years.  	“You got a Toyota.” he said “You may even pass this car to your grandchildren with this battery in it.” I should have known by that comment something was up 	Sitting in a car that was not moving made me claustrophobic. I got out of the car and took my bottle of water with me. The night air felt like embrace of a beautiful woman. I was refreshed and thought about spending the night on top of the hood like some kind of alley cat. My next thought was of what kind of animals would I come across. I had always heard stories of mountain lions attacking people. I don’t even know if I was close to a mountain, but I was not going to take any chances.  	I stayed outside for five more minutes. I found a fig and went back inside. I had finished my fig and discarded the carcass out the passenger window when I saw a car coming in my rearview mirror. 	I jumped out of the car and began to start waving my hands. The car was coming really fast. It was so dark, I couldn’t tell what kind of car it was. I was nervous and hopped up and down with excitement.  	“Nobody knows that you are out here.” I said to myself. The last person to see me was Tony, but I saw him three days ago. My cell phone battery died two days ago. Whoever could be in this car could abduct me and I may not be found for months. I considered going back in my car. I was certain that if I went back in my car, the oncoming vehicle would pass my car figuring it for abandoned. It might have been a better idea to do this in the daylight. 	“You always jump to crazy conclusions” I laughed. There was only a slight chance that this car would even see me. There was an even slighter chance that this car would even pull over to help. The law of percentages began to dominate my thinking. How many cars have to pass before someone would actually stop and help me. It may take five to seven cars before one would even stop. The chances of this car stopping were so slim that I decided to stay out there and wave for the law of percentages.

						   	You're outraged at something your boss has done, and you've written a "poor me" email message to a friend. In this message, you've completely trashed your boss. You hit the Send button. Then you realize you've sent the message to your boss.   Your office door opens. It's your boss.  Write around 500 words, telling us what happens next.  	I clubbed myself over the head a couple of times and now it is actually time to do something. I know that at any moment Mr. Samuels will open his Netscape and check his mail and he will find my e-mail pouring my guts and gripes about working for him. If I can get to his Netscape first, I may be able to delete the e-mail and empty his trash so that the message is gone forever. Samuels doesn’t need to see that e-mail. Half of the stuff that I put in that e-mail is just the product of working with people with very different perspectives on life.  	Of all the stuff that I said about Samuels, I didn’t mean half of it. I have it a lot better than half the people that I know. I get paid a good amount of money and my hours are mine to make. I will never work from home, but I am surrendered to that idea. I am indispensable because Samuels does not know how to use his computer beyond his word processor and e-mail. I become valuable when something beyond that comes around. These tasks that are beyond his faculty arise every week or so.  	I can get to his computer. I just need the right excuse. Something that will give me access to his computer without pricking his curisosity. 	“Mr Samuels...I need to inspect your computer.” he was in the middle of writing a letter to someone and seems reluctant to give up his computer.  	“Give me five minutes and then its all yours.” he replied. That would be fine. I could wait and then fix whatever or update whatever I had to update.  	“Sorry sir, I think that it is important that I take care of this problem right now.” I can tell he is irritated, but is he is succombing to my computer knowledge. 	“Why?” his last valiant attempt to keep me away for a few minutes. 	“Well I was running a virus check on the network and I detected a virus on your computer.” Fear of the unknown was my weapon. I didn’t even know if that was possible. 	“How come my anti virus software didn’t find it?” He has  had a virus on his computer before.  	“Well this must be a particularly well crafted virus. I think it probably got on your computer through someone’s e-mail.” He tensed and moved for the  Netscape button on his toolbar. I knew I messed up when I said e-mail. “You might have sent it to everyone in your address book.” He froze and moved the cursor away from the button. “I’m sorry sir...I have been so busy the last couple of weeks that I haven’t been able to keep the anti virus software up to date like I should have.” 	I knew that the virus comment had scared him and I may have bought myself the luxury of five minutes of him not opening his e-mail for five minutes.  	“Am I going to lose anything?” he asked 	“Well I won’t know that until I get in your computer.”

						    Today, write 200 words about your job. 	My job is not the kind of job that makes people go “wow” in a good way. I have sat at dinner or had coffee with people and the ask the typical “so what do you do for a living?” question. I have found the best way to make people understand is to say that “I manage bankruptcy estates”. I think that gives people a mixed response. The mention of bankruptcy is like saying that you work for the IRS. You get to deal with people who have messed up in some way financially. I have to explain the whole “liquidation of assets for the benefit of creditors” and they nod. And yes I do have to take people’s houses from them sometimes. I don’t enjoy it, but they should have refinanced before they filed bankruptcy. 	I do all that however on a day to day  life I don’t seem to do anything all that interesting. I answer the phone (because there is just me and my boss) and I listen to people’s sob stories about why they had to file bankruptcy or how somebody who owes them a lot of money filed bankruptcy and how much they need that money back. I used to be more sympathetic, but after six years I am jaded and don’t trust most of what people tell me.   	Most of my job has to do with the numbers and stuff behind the scene. Alot of time these are not people to me. They names and case numbers. They bank accounts and reports that need to be submitted so that all things are righteous with out paperwork. They are files and motions for orders that give me authority to do what I need to do.  	I get yelled at from both sides and I have learned that bankruptcy is a painful process for everyone except the big credit card companies that seem to force most people into bankruptcy.

						   Write about a song you love.    	“Check The Rhyme” will always be my favorite hip hop song of all time. A Tribe Called Quest did something there that will never be replicated. I don’t know if it is the horns, but I think that it is part of what makes that song so incredible. The drums at the beginning with Q-Tip going “Uh..Uh..Uh”. Then the horns come in and man you feel like the song is about to take you somewhere. The song is the perfect mixture of music and lyrics. Some song are music heavy and some songs are lyric strong, but if there was a perfect combination “Check the Rhime” has it.  	Ya on point Tip? 	All the time Fife. 	Ya on point Tip? 	All the time Fife. 	I loved working out to this song. I love the chorus and how it takes the energy of the song to a whole nother level. These guys were geniuses and it still hurts my heart that they broke up. Its like losing one of the great groups of hip hop. I have this theory about mature rappers and I don’t feel like repeating myself right now.  	This one songs holds so many of hip hop’s great one liners.  	“Scrawny but I move like Lou Brock” 	“Before I get the butt, the jim must be erect.” 	So many that have stuck with me almost 15 years later.

						   Write about where rivers join. 	 	“What are you so proud of?” Cynthia yelled and I know that things were not going to go the way that they were supposed to.  	“All I said is that I am glad that I am white. You talk about how proud you are of being black all the time. You always put down me for my white traits. There are good things about white people.” 	She snarled at me and rolled her eyes and I thought about going home. Yet it took so long to get to Eden that I had no ambition to just turn around and go home. The two hour hike through a forest of trees so lush that the sun just barely go through to iluminate their path. The hike wasn’t bad, it was the swim to get to Eden. Cynthia was not an expert swimmer and the currents of two rivers coming together challenged her novice skills. I swam next to her making sure that she didn’t drift off course and the currents didn’t take her to lower Oregon. The swim took another thirty minutes to get to Eden.  	They called the little island in the middle of the meeting of the Sampson and the Milton rivers Eden because the biblical one was surrounded by rivers also. We were supposed to have lunch and sit out in the sun and possibly get into extra curricular activities if you know what I mean. Things began spectacular when we got to the island. I was admiring Cynthia in her bathing suit, feeling the sunshine felt like God smiling down on me. She had recovered from the swim and had Lois Lane eyes for helping get through the rough currents to the shores of Eden. I didn’t know if things could get any better than this.   	“It is good to be white!” I declared. Cynthia shot up in disagreement. 	“What did you just say?” I knew things were going down hill. She looked at me like I was wearing a white pillow case on my head. I was not any kind of particular kind of white American. I was not Irish, Italian or Polish. I was not any other kind of American. I guess I could trace my people back to the colonists.

						   What's your favourite pastime? Do you play tennis, go to the gym, listen to music? Relate an experience with your favourite pastime. Write 200  words. 	My favorite pastime has to be reading. I read everywhere. I read in the bathroom and I read on the bus. I read when I am at work and it is rare that I do not have a book on me to read if there is some time to waste. I have read close to 10 books this year. If you are what you read, then I think that I am in good place.  	One experience I had when it comes to reading comes up when I am reading and a person asks me what I am reading. Once I tell them, they give me that look that says that the title of the book doesn’t help them figure out what the book is about. I don’t read biographies so there is not a picture of who the book is about on the cover. The is no catchy subtitle like there are on some books. I read fiction, so the title is supposed to be something that makes you want to reads the book to see what the title is all about. You can readthe sleeves of the book that I am reading to what the book is about in that enticing language that makes people want to buy books. 	I usually try to explain to people what I am reading and they generally give me that blank stare so I don’t even finish my explanation. I just try to give them enough so that they know that I have read  it.

						    It's what I do at 2.30 in the morning when I can't sleep. 	 	If its 2:30 in the morning and I can’t sleep, I am going to hit the Playstation 2. I have this season going on Triple Play where I am the Detroit Tigers. I picked the Tigers because they were the worst team in the game and I wanted the challenge. I figured that I didn’t want to breeze through the game and be undefeated. If I don’t feel like I have the coordination to play Triple Play, then I will put Unbreakable in the VCR. I love the story of Unbreakable. I think that Shamalyan is an incredible storyteller. I think that the movie didn’t do that well because I don’t know if film was the best medium for that story. It may have been a great novel. Anyways I put that movie and I usually don’t get farther than 45 minutes into the movie into that movie. As much as I love the story, it has that Sixth Sense pace. 	Sometimes if it is 2:30 in the moring and I can’t sleep, I will try to jump my wife’s bones. I have done it a couple of times. I have been successful about 60% of the time. Here is the thing, I will not get any assistance from her in the arousal department. I have to be aroused one way or another (I don’t care to go into my methods right now). Then I just have to get her shorts and panties off. That is her usual bed attire. That usually is not the hard part. It does not take long to tell if this attempt is going to be successful or not. All I have to do is take her clothes off and roll her over (she sleeps on her side or her stomach). If she rolls back over and makes any kind of annoyed moan, then forget it. This attempt will fail. Any further attempts will only lead to an incredible frustration and an angry wife who is mad because you interrupted her sleep. If I roll her over and take her clothes off and she is just laying there, then I can go to work. As soon as there is the slightest penetration, she will awaken happy to oblige me. Usually that middle of the night sex is the best. Something about waking her up gets rid of her inhibitions.  	The thing about middle of the night sex (heck sex in general) is that once we are done I fall right asleep. There is something about ejaculation that lets everything out of me and I fall asleep like a baby. I will snore like a grizzly bear.

						    Secretly, I know my name is ________. 	 	Secretly, I know my name is Mark Young. I have been a criminal for the last 30 years. Some may see something wrong with a person calling himself a criminal. I am resigned with what I have been for the last 30 years. I will not try to make the life that I have lived noble in anyway. In fact it has been hard, brutal and heartbreaking. I have been a criminal, however I am not a good criminal. I have spent more 23 of my 30 years of being a criminal in a prison of some kind.  	If you have to know, I chose the life that I live a long time ago. My dad was a sailor, who was a garbage man and trained boxers. He had won his awards while he boxed in the Navy. He wanted one of his sons to be a boxer. In the end when we didn’t measure up, we were labeled sissys. When you are six years old and you are labeled a sissy, all you want to do is prove that you are not a sissy. So that is what I did. It started with martial arts classes. My dad was not impressed. Then I saw that the gangstas in my hood were tough, I wanted to run with them. When I got initiated into the gang, all my dad could talk about was that I was a big dumbie. I just thought that I had become too tough for him. I think that is when I decided to be a criminal. Nobody calls a criminal a sissy. I stuck people up and beat down whoever I had to beat down. I bet they thought to call me a sissy or a big dumbie. Sometimes I would make them tell me how smart I was because I didn’t put a cap in them.  	I have made my mistakes. I got caught up with that rock. I snorted it smoked it and if I had to use a needle I would. I did a lot of dumb things because I loved that rock. All the times that I got caught by the cops, it was because I was doing something for the rock.

						    Let's try another improv. Write 300 words, and include these  three words: Oxford, Debonair, Spectacle.   	Something had happened to Julie when she went to Oxford. Something that I hadn’t even thought about when she left four years ago. We had been friends since we both walked to the park and played in the sand box. When we got older, she was my undercover agent with the girl that I wanted to get with. I always reciprocated with the guys that she liked. We got through highschool and she was going to Oxford University in England. I was going to miss her, but this day was expected for both of us. The last place that I wanted to go to school was Los Angeles. I wanted to go to some quaint little city and focus on learning and taking in everything that I could.  	My plan was that I was going to graduated and write the great American novel. I graduated with honors and I was told that the best place to pursue my writing was in New York or Los Angeles. So I decided to go back to LA. Julie cam back that same year. I needed a job while I wrote the great American novel and I was able to work for an elitist private school that appreciated the recommendation from my professors who had written their own great American novels. Not only did they appreciate my aspirations, but they paid me well to pursue my dream.  	All I had to do was make Twain, Hawthorne and Haley exciting. That was no big thing to me. I had enough memories of highschool and teenage years to keep things from crossing the line into boring. Its about passion. The kids wanted someone who was passionate. Their parents paid college tuitions for them to go to schools where the teachers could teach ‘To Kill A Mockingbird’ with feeling. 	Julie was back and she was clerking at a law firm while she waited for her bar results. We kicked it about once a week. She was my girl. We could go to the bar and drink a beer and talk about careers and love. Nothing was going to happen because we knew too much about each other. Even after being apart for four years, she was just the girl who had lived two doors down.  	I don’t know what happened in England, but Julie cam back obsessed with her nose. She wanted a nose job as much as she wanted pass the bar exam. It was crooked but not in a way that made her ugly. She was drop dead beautiful. A man would fall in love with her and never think twice about her nose. Someting happened in England though. She was determined to get a nose job. She a matter of months away from making serious money, but she had no plans of waiting until then to get her nose fixed. 	“I want to get my Jennifer Petty.” she would tell me. 	I would try to reassure her that it really wasn’t necessary. She would not be persuaded. She schedule her surgery and all her anticipation was overwhelming for me. All she could talk about was her nose. She wanted to know if I would visit her and help take care of her after the surgery. I told her I would do what I could. I did have the great American novel to write after all.  	A week before the she came over to check out my apartment. We were going to watch the Laker game and I had some questions for her about women. She was the interpreter of women for me. I wouldn’t be able to write a good women without the help of Julie.  	It was halftime when she started talking about her nose. I rolled my eyes and she could tell that I was through this whole nose job thing. 	“Don’t do that Ellison.” she said 	“I will just be glad when all this nose job experience is over.” I replied 	“I am glad that you said that. I need your help. I am about $2,000 short of what I need for the surgery.” 	“Are you hittin me up for some dough for your nose?” 	“I wouldn’t but my surgery is next Thursday and I know you don’t want to listen to me talk about Jennifer Petty for three more months.” 	She turned to me and adjusted my spectacles and and gave me this debonair look. 	“Ell...when all this is over, I will make it worth your while. Won’t you want to kiss me when I have my Jennifer Petty.” 	“What!” I was so shocked that this girl who I had known since we both tried to smoke cigarettes together was propositioning me in exchange for money for her nose job.”

						   You're eating breakfast. 	 	I was eating my oatmeal this morning and reading about the Dodgers futility when I realized that I did not have any coffee. I got up and walked into the kitchen. The coffee maker was a birthday present from three years ago. The kind with an alarm so that by the time my alarm clock went off at 6:00am, the coffee would have been made fifteen minutes earlier. I had my mug and had recently switched to Equal. I feared Sweet-N-Low, however I felt at ease with Equal.  	The oatmeal was a healthy alternative that I actually enjoyed. Although I would make mine creamy, which may not be recommended by all those no-carb low fat health freaks, but I enjoyed it and I couldn’t be destroying too much of the healthy benefits of the oatmeal with a little milk.  	I was reading about some local high school baseball player who had thrown three no-hitters when R. entered the dining room. 	“Morning” I could tell that she was still waking up.  	“Mooorning” she replied. She stood over me waiting for a kiss. I tilted my head upward waiting for a peck. Instead she sat in my lap facing me. 	“I just woke up from the best dream.” 	“Really...what did you dream about?” A smirk appeared on my face and I could feel the blood begin to flow to my groin.  	“I had this dream that we were making love in the rain. It felt so good. I was licking rain drops off of your body and you were grabbing my breasts.” she opened her robe “Now I am so horny.” 	“Well what do you think that we should do about that?” I asked already knowing the answer. 	“I don’t know.” she took off her robe and began nibbling on my neck. “I can’t wait until it rains.” She grabbed my shirt and began to lift it up over my head. I reached for the coffee and oatmeal to move them. The newspaper was tossed to the floor.  	“I don’t think that I can wait for the rain.” she hopped up on the table. I was so grateful that she didn’t have any panties on. She pulled my shorts off and then....

						    Write about divine intervention. 	 	If I were to write about divine intervention, I think that it is only right that I mention the devil. Maybe that would just make this story balanced. Well it starts with two college students who belonged to the your typical Christian student organization. These two guys went to the Wednesday night bible study group when their school work permitted. They happened to be roommates and in their little apartment created a safe zone for themselves. They were on a college campus, ripe with ideas that were both good and bad, full of people trying to figure out who they were and who they were going to be. A campus full of people who were there to enjoy themselves and experiment with every kind of thrill they could come in contact with. It was the free from the womb syndrome in so many of the new students. Some had already kept this lifestyle and when it came to bigger things in college they justified everything by saying “I have done the same things back home”.  	These two students were on a mission to get degrees and save souls. They spent their free time talking to people about their relationship with God hoping to spark the interest of some student who had never heard of such things. They never offered church. They only offered the Bible.  	Early in the semester they found a classmate who wanted to know about God. They had many times of bible study. The classmate knew nothing and was grateful that these guys were more than willing to share the gospel with him. he learned things about God that he never knew before. They had a regular meeting day and time.  	After four or five studies together, the two Christians decided that it was time to study sin. The classmate had never thought about it before. He learned about all kinds of sin that he had never thought that was sin before. There were even things that the classmate enjoyed that he was informed were sin. Things that he didn’t want to give up all that quickly. 	Well the impetuous Christians called their friend to the standard of the bible and he had a negative reaction.There was more discussion and reasoning about leaving the life of sin. The classmate was not convinced. He sat on the fence of righteousness and the rest of the world with little inclination to jump into the light. The Christians saw they were losing their friend. The last resort was the dsicussion about judgment. Final judgment was supposed the be the last resort. No one wants to threaten a person with the end, the Christians had to tell their friend that they were reminding him of the impermanence of the life he was living. They asked him where he wanted to spend eternity. 	When he said that he would have to deal with that later. The roommates told him of Hell and the certainty that he was going there. The only thing that would save him would be repentance. They were strong and they knew it. How were they to talk about salvation lightly?  	They left feeling sad for their friend who would not continue on the journey that they were on, but glad that they spread the gospel to another soul. They were filled with a desire to do more. They were talking about who they would study the bible with next when they started crossing the street. Then the were both hit by a truck.  	I begane this story by saying that I had to talk about the devil if I was going to talk about God. Well the devil was definitely pissed off at these two college students when he decided that he was going to take them out with a truck. Yet God stepped in and pulled these two apostles out of the way. They had bruises and a few scrapes. However how did they get out of the way were it not for God? How did these two students take these little shots from a truck that was racing down the street. The truck did not hit its brakes and it kept on going after the students were sprawled on the ground.

						    Today we'll do an improvisation. Write 200 words, and include  these three words: Galleon, Home, Charisma.   	 	I was sitting at home when I got the phone call from Samuel. He was always readinig this book and that book. That is what I loved about Samuel. He was so into his boooks that when I hung out with him, he was spittin all sorts of knowledge on me. Well Samuel called because he had read about this Spanish galleon that was full of slaves on its way to America. The slaves revolted and the ship sunk. Samuel wanted to search the Carribean for the ship. I was intrigued because he was so passionate about finding this boat. Samuel had this helter skelter charisma that would come and go. He was always excited about things that the rest of us couldn’t quite get into.  	“How much is it going to cost me?” I asked. Such an adventure sounded fun, but would I have the funds. 	“This has been something that I have been searching for all my life.”  Samuel exclaimed. Then he told me how he had the funds for both us to search for about a month. We would have to find something in a month, or we would have to come back and save some more money. 	This boat was like the Amistad yet not as successful. There is a duplicity in history that seems to indicate to me that such a story could be true. For everything that has happened, there has been two.  	On top of all of this was the fact that I have wanted to go to the Carribean all my life. The fact that I could go for free was way too much for me.

						   Security  	If I have to talk about security, the very first thing I think of is personal security. How secure you are about yourself says a lot about who you are. It says a lot about what kind of person you  are. There are posers...people who want you to think that they are secure and there are people who are super secure with themselves. Those people who are super secure tend to be eccentric because they have no sense of fear. I think that is good, but the whole eccentrcity thing is tough for me. I think that you have to be immensely secure to say “I don’t care”. I say that but deep down, I care a whole lot.  	Security makes me think of Homeland Security which I am not a big fan of. Its not that I don’t think that after 9/11 things needed too change. Yet like so many things after big events, things change so violently. I guess that should not be a problem. However it is a big problem, when peoples’ rights are being taken. Limits are being put on people and taken away from the government. Those in the current administration want to blame things like customs and immigration and not enough blame on lack of taking intelligence seriuously. If government would say “we didn’t take the intel seriously but we are looking at things differently now and we need to sure up customs and immigration. I would be cool somewhat. 	I was in a usergroup for Earthlink. They have a new feature for their Start Page. You could check your bank balances and stocks and all sorts things that you would have to login to. Almost everyone was worreid about the security issues. I was not worried. I am secure that these things are a matter of fate. Now I don’t leave doors unlocked and stuff like that, but I do understand that I have God and he can protect me from that sort of stuff.

						    Perfection is __________.         Perfection is hitting an outside fastball into left field. Perfection is hitting the grand slam homerun when your team is down three in the last inning. At least that was what I thought was perfection before that day in Springfield. Perfection was a dribbling ground ball that I turned into a base hit.     I was standing in the on deck circle when Wendy Sanchez came up to me and smiled. Her “How you doin Travis” said so much more than four words. There was something there that I had yet to explore. I thought she was just one of the baseball groupies from school, but that question indicated so much more.      “Doin good. Thanks for coming.” I smiled. The guy ahead of me was working his way through a five pitch strikeout. “This at-bat’s for you” then I walked away and made my way to the batter’s box.     There is only one field where I would make that sort of promise and it was Springfield. I had never gotten out at Springfield. The team knew me by name even though I had only played five games there my entire time in high school. So I strolled to home plate listening to their coach make the team aware that I was coming to the plate.     The first pitch was high and outside. I took a step out of the batter’s box and shot a look at Wendy before I looked down at the coach. He gave me the usual go to work sign. The next pitch was a fastball knee high and on the outside corner, I had a taste for those pitches lately so I swung and ball dribbled off my bat and toward third base. I took off out of the batter’s box as if my life depended on it. I was thinking as I streaked down the line that I was so grateful that I was a left-handed hitter. I was safe by three steps.     I knew this was not impressive and i was afraid to look at Wendy yet. I decided that I had to steal a base to restore some of my bravado. So the first pitch was thrown and second base was stolen.     I felt like that was good, but I really wanted to impress Wendy, so the next  pitch was thrown and third base was stolen. That was when I slid her a glance and a smirk. Too bad the next pitch was strike three and the third out.

						       A woman named Leslie Johnson tried to win the heart of Percy Andrews. She tried baking for him, and as much as he enjoyed the oatmeal raisin cookies with odor of affection, his heart was not offered in gratitude. Then she started wearing short skirts and blouse that showed the gifts that God had given her, but he failed to recognize that he could unwrap these presnts also.       Finally she wore her red dress and asked Percy why he didn't make any moves.      "Because my heart is broken"      "How long has your heart been broken?"      "10 years"      "You mean you haven't been in a relationship for 10 years!" instantly her heart wanted to love him more.      "No I have been in relationships, but I have still been heartbroken.Susanna Jones wore a red dress and the thought of the love that I had for her and she for me still brings me to tears."

						       A woman named Susanna Jones walked into my life on January 9th nine years ago. I never thought that things would go the way that they did in the last nine years. She was on her way to the Democratic National Covnvention when I ran into her on the subway. I could tell by the stars in her eyes and smirk of pride on her face she was excited to riding the train. I was plugged into my CD player because who wants to know what is going while the train is in motion.       The cops came down and came from the car behind ours to check everyone’s documentation. LA trains were strange because there were no turnsytyles or anything to make sure you paid your fare.  A person migh even assume that the trains were free.       They stopped by Susanna Jones and asked her for her documentation. Ofcourse she didn’t have any. The cops were sweatingher and began chiseling her info on a ticket.       “Give her a break...she’s here for the convention.” someone said. I turned to see that someone was me.       “Mind you business.” one of the officers yelled at me.      “Its my business when you are going to let a woman fromout of town wering a red dress like that out in MacArthur Park. That is just asking the thugs up there to have their way with her.” She instantly looked at me with a sense of fear that I hadn’t seen in anyone in quite a while.      The cops must have had a quota to fill that night because usually women wearing red dressed like Susanna’s got off with a smile and the hint of a flirt. So instead of letting the cops escort her off of the train, I escorted Susanna Jones from Portland Oregon off of the train at the MacArthur Park Station.

						    Write about avenues of escape.       My mother taught me that the best avenue of scape is to travel somewhere inside yourself. When there is too much drama going oon outside of you, then you travel deep inside of you. People can’t penetrate that deep, and if they do, you are doing battle with them on your terms. She told me the story of her first husband, long before she married my dad, who loved to argue and yell. The sick bastard didn’t feel like they were really talking unless they were in the heat of things. Moms could neber understand that. Maybe he like dthe make-up sex.       After the first year, Mom decided that she was not going to fight back. She was going to go deep within herself, where she could not hear him. It was a beautfully silent place where mom could hear a stream flowing and when she fgound that silent place, h the husband was frustrated with talking to her when she was not going to fight back.       After six months of being frustrated, the hisband lost it and grabeed mom by the shoulders and shook her trying to shake her up. Instead he took the trip deep inside of her and he travelled to that place where the only sound that could be heard was the sound of the stream. He realized that he had no voice in this place and could make no noise in this place.       He was so frightened that he let go of Mom and they never argued again. Needing so desperately to argue with someone, he divorced Mom.

						                  One Saturday night in the later September,   Wilson   came to town. When   Wilson   came to town, all other things would have to wait until that Sunday morning when we both stumbled to the Amtrak station and sent him on his way. Weekends with   Wilson   consisted of drinking way more than we should and flirting with every possible woman that would give us the time of day.                 What I forgot was that the Dodgers were playing the Giants in the final weekend of the season. The Dodgers were up by one game with two games to play. Well let’s say that I didn’t forget. I jumped out of bed screaming at  4:21am  when I realized what I had done.                 I had willed the Dodgers into first place. They were a decent team that I made better by sitting in my chair and cheering them on to victory. I would even go to the stadium and catch a game here or there. I had willed them to winning streaks of 6 and 8 games. I had watched 145 of the 160 games up to that point in the season. Of the 15 games I had missed the Dodgers were 3 and 12. I was completely responsible for the losses. They needed me in my chair and doing my cheering.                  They had lost games with me watching, but that was the manager’s fault. I had seen him leave a pitcher in too long. I had seen him bring in a tired pitcher. Some nights, the team just didn’t hit and that was baseball. However when I was there this did not happen often. I would keep the manager in check. I helped the guys play inspired ball.                 I couldn’t believe that I traded in five months of sitting and motivating the team from my easy chair for one Saturday night out with     Wilson    . I threw in seven years of no post season baseball for seven beers, a couple shots of tequila and the phone number of a woman I would never be able to pick out of a police line-up.

						     One Saturday night,          One Saturday night, this dude showed up at the door. It wasn’t too late for friends but it was definitely too late for strangers. It wasn’t too late for friends, but none of my friends come by that late without making a phone call before they even make the trip.       Anyways this dude was breathing hard and sweating as if he had ventured across a desert to knock on my door. I was afraid for him. Men don’t sweat like unless they were provoked by something out there.       “You Mr. Nelson?”       “Yes”      “I am Martin Townsend, you’re mother’s cousin.” He smiled and sweat was steady dripping down his face. He wore some slacks and a caridnal dress shirt that were damp and had sweat stains in the places that they polyester couldn’t hold back the flood of  sweat.       “What you doin here Martin Townsend?” To say that I was a little sketpical was an understatement. I could here somebody getting shot in the movie behind me and Martin kept looking over his back also because the gunshots he heard were real.       “Well yo mama told me if I got to town, I should look you up. So I am lookin you up.” He decided to sacrifice one his sleeves to clean the sweat off of his face.      “Its kind of late. Why you sweatin so much?” I smirked because I knew that the conversation was turning to my favor.       “Well I thought that, but then I knew that we was family and there is no such thing wehn you are family.”

						     Write about the fault line.          They say that Oscar Sharp was driven to build the park on the fault  line. No one would build a skyscraper on the fault line and the land  could be used for something. Some said it would be good for some kind  of single story shopping center. Oscar could see that but he hated the  usual corporate infiltration of Starbucks, Panda Express, Roebecks and  Baja Fresh. The world did not need another one of these on any corner  or in anymore shopping centers.          He had an epiphany and idea about the park on a night when he was  sitting at his computer and he wanted to make love to his wife. They  had an incredible night of sex the night before. A night that made  Oscar smile the next morning. A night that made Oscar think of it all  day. He couldn't wait to leave the office so that he could go home and  try to re-live the night before. It was like a video game that he had  to play more and more.          The night had been like an exquisite meal to his wife. She enjoyed  every bite and even told Osacr how delicious he was. However like a  meal that is enjoyed one night. You don't want the same thing the next  night. That night she wanted a long night of sleep.          A night when Tasha decided that she would rather dine on some extra  hours of sleep left Oscar to debate the proposal he had received about  buying the land and designing something on it that would make a  difference. Something that would make up for its lack of height with  innovative creativity and love. Much like the fault line that Oscar was  going to design something over, he was ready to explode. He was not  sure if it was anger, bitterness or sheer sexaul desire.

						     Write about a sudden storm.          It was election day and I knew that the conservative right was  battling my and the other black people in my liberal left neighborhood  when the room at the fire station where we had been voting for the last  four years had gotten smaller and smaller. The room started off in this  back room that had nothing but space. For people to wait and they had  at least 8 booths in the room. The next years it was the same room, but  there was some extra equipment so there was only six booths and there  was less waiting room. This year there was no room to wait in the side  the room so we were lined up next to the fire engine in the garage. The  only difference that we could all understand was the number of black  people who had moved into the district. We knew that religious right  had scored some kind of victory when there was a sudden storm that  discouraged people to stand in the line to vote because it stretched  far outside and around the fire station only the few angry democrats in  the neighborhood stayed and withstood the rain to make sure that they  voted. The storm started at 5pm and didn't seem to end until long after  the polls had closed. I got home at 4:30 and I cooked a snack while I  waited for Virginia to come home so that we could go to the polls  together. Just as she pulled into the driveway at 5pm. I opened the  door to see the clouds that had rolled in between now and the time that  I had come home.

						   Write 100 words using these three words: Steal, Ocean, Mystery.  Choose three words from that, then write another 100 words including those three words.  Keep going, if you like, and pick another three words from your improv.    	Some would say that taking sea shells home after a long day at the beach is stealing from the ocean. That’s a mystery to me but I let them have their opinions. I would only entertain such a theory after some careful reasearch was done proving that taking sea shells home after a long day at the beach was detrimental. I mean is there any proof that the removal of one shell has made the difference in the water quality or the envrionment. I am all for the environment. I have even begun to eat organic, but let’s not get crazy.  opinion, theory, organic  	It was always her opinion of me that meant so very much. I don’t know why. Its not like she had ever said anything to me. Even in the elevator when it was just the two of us. She simply watched the numbers change on the dial until it reached whatever floor she was going to that day. My theory was that she was so attracted to me that she didn’t know what to do. So she stared at the dial. At least that is what I did. This theory was organic coming from somewhere in my heart. I had no real proof. I just decided to take her ignoring me as more confirmation that there was something going on between us. There was this unspoken sexual tension. She wanted me and I wanted her. However we were going to pretend that there was nothing there. It drove me crazy and made me laugh all at the same time. I knew that is why she passed my cubicle the way that she did. I know that is why she stopped by to see if I could buy cand for her daughter’s school find raiser.  elevator, tension, fundraiser  	So one day we were int he elevator and  I really wanted to be in the elevator by myself. I didn’t want the polite kindness courtesy of filler conversation for the next nine floors. I knew he wanted it. I could sense the tension to make eye contact. I looked at the numbers as they changed from 3 to 4 and hoped that 9 would miraculously pop up. 4 turned to 5 and I knew that I wouldn’t be able to hold out any longer. So I looked at him and smiled and nodded my head in a way that said hello and yet didn’t open myself up for conversation.  	“Can I ask you a question?” he jumped at the opportunity. 	“Sure...what’s up?” 	“Well my daughter has this fundraiser and I was thinking maybe you would like to buy some wrapping paper.” 	7 turned to 8 and I knew that I would have to sit in the door at 9 because this guy’s pitch would not be done by the time that we got there.  	“I know it September and it is early, but if you buy it now, you won’t be searching for it when it is all sold out in December.”  kindness, conversation, paper  	No matter how filled with kindness Sam could sound on paper, he seemed to lack a drop of it in person. He wrote her postcards and they dripped with affection and attachment. Yet as the minutes of their very first coffe passed on, Sam seemed detached from life and she was wondering if there was a Cyrano somewhere writing all these beautiful words on paper. He appeared to know what the cards had said and the key phrases that were used. Paulette could not see this man who was sitting in front of her writing the postcards that she had come to expect every three days. 	The man in the letter never spoke of fear of certain public places and allergies and a paranoia about an ex-girlfriend popping out of nowhere. The man in the postcards talked of romance and love. He talked of their first encounter as if it were a secret rendevous in a rose garden after a spring rain, not the car wash where they had actually met.  postcards, Cyrano, paranoia

						    Write about opening a gift. 	 	It was my 28th birthday party and my wife had fooled me into thinking that I was only going to breakfast. When I got to the Radisson and there were my friends I was super excited. It was one of those things that I do like to have people around me on my birthday. I had been dicsouraged because I was going to be in a friend’s wedding all day and what could be cool about that. I got cards and gifts which I always like toopen later when I am by myself. I guess I get embarassed about opening presents in front of people. I have opened presents in front of people before and nothing bad happened. I can do it, I just prefer to do it in private.  	For the previous I had been begging every family member and friend that I knew would buy me a present for a laptop. It was the essential tool for me to be the write that I knew that I could be. The dynamics of my life dictated that I needed to write outside the house and what better way to write outside of the crib than with a laptop.  	I went to sleep the night before certain that there would be a laptop waiting for me the next morning. When my wife woke me up and gave me a card and a gift I thought it was a laptop and it wasn’t  I was disappointed. Can you be disappointed about a gift? I know that it appeared on my face. 	Breakfast was cool to see my friends and family. The funny thing is that I don’t like to be the center of attention. I like to treat those sort of functions like we all got together to hang out. There doesn’t have to be any singing and there doesn’t have to be any cake and there especially doesn’t have to be any opening of gifts.  	Wife on the other hands does not know how to plan a small party. I think it is just how she gre up, but it goes against my nature to have a big party in my honor. My wife makes everything larger than life. There was the larger than life breakfast and birthday cake. Then she wanted the larger than life gifts. I went through cards and gift and there was no laptop. Finally my wife handed me an evelope. 	“I didn’t know what kind of laptop to get you so here.”  	“Thanks honey.” I sad and I was grateful, but I knew that my face said “ah man”.  	I felt embarassed that all my friends saw my face and saw that I was not feeling the gift. I got angry at my wife because she put me in that position and it was her fault that I was embarassed.

						     'The window had other views.' (after Wislawa Szymborska)        Noah knew that the window had other views. He knew that he had sat in the window and watched kids on bikes ride the Tour de France through the neighborhood. He had watched boys walk to the park working on their killer crossover. Then there were the girls who were walking down the street to get his attention and the attention of any other guy who would give them some. If the guy was attractive the attention was returned. If the guy was ugly the attention was ignored.        The window sometimes showed the summer showers that fell like clouds exploded and was gone as quickly as it came. There were times when the window was full of snow and tracks of cars, people and animals traced through it. He could see ice forming near the window frame.        He wanted to think of all the other views that the window had because the gunshots from the current view had forced to the floor. He could hear voice yelling and one yelp. The gunshots pushed him from a dream about Kathy Toomer and the smoothness of her legs on to the floor where he could hear people screaming. There were a few more gunshots and then there was silence.        The silence was the scariest part.  He wondered what brought about the silence. He wondered if they taking aim at witnesses scanning out the window and making sure that they could not be identified. What happened to the guy who had been shot? There was no noise. Noah debated sleeping on the floor. He wanted to make sure that there was nobody outside. He wanted to make sure that it was over for the night. That tomorrow the pretty girls would walk up the block and not only would they have his attention, but his words and his heart. He would thk of something to say and let them know that he always watched them come down the street and go down the street.        The silence made his thoughts sound like screams. If the guy who got shot was out ther breathing, it would not be heard over all the thoughts that he had in his head.        He wondered if he should get back in bed. He wonder if getting into bed would rustle the blinds and bring a barrage of bullets. How many guns were there anyway?

						   "I walked into the Maverick Bar in Farmington, N.M." (after Gary Snyder)       I walked into the Maverick bar in Farmington N.M. and I knew that I was on the right track. I had been chasing the legend of Mantan Moreland from New York to Chicago and a lot of little towns in between, and everyone talked about Mantan going to the Maverick Bar in Farmington New Mexico. No matter where I went I heard the same story.     I am sure that the Maverick Bar is not the bar of 35 or 40 years ago when Mantan would rolled through town and would have performed here. The first sign of that was all the white people. The Maverick was supposed to be a place where black people could walk in the front door to get a drink and meet themselves a woman or two. Nowadays it was majority white with a sprinkling of black, brown red and yellow. Although the racial distribution changed, it didn’t seem that the structure and the architecture had changed all that much. There was a bar, a stage, tables and some space where there were no tables that probably served as the dance floor. That must have been the stage.     I grabbed a stool at the bar and ordered myself a draft. I gave careful inspection to the pictures behind the bartender. Going through that existed on a  six foot by eight foot space on the wall. There was Robert Johnson and there was pictures that I had seen before in my treks through former juke joints that people couldn’t seem to put names to. Then there was Mantan’s picture.     “So who owns this bar?” I asked the bartender.     “I do...it been in my family for at least 5 generations.” He stood upright with an exhale of pride.      “Well what do you know about Mantan?”     “Oh man! You want to hear that story? That story gets passed down the generations with the deed to this place.” He smirked “Let’s see how this goes....Mantan came to town, long before he was in those Charlie Chan movies, he was a dancer. He was tapping and singing with what little voice he had. He did the most amazing thing though. He could spin on his head like a break dancer, but that was before there was break dancing. Well he was performing on that stage right there. He ended his act with that spin and when he hopped up, there was blood trickling down his neck. He had a splinter in his head. Something about how the splinter got his head infected and his hair all fell out.”     I took off my hat and showed him my head that never had a hair on it in my entire life.

						    Write about masks.         It was always amazing that the right pair of glasses and a hiarcut made me a different person. I put my subscription to Esquire to work and made went away from the twisties to a haircut that was short and clean. At least that was all the people who saw it said. Then I got the Clark Kents instead of my mad scientist glasses that I worse before. The shaving of the mustache was the final step to putting on a mask. I was shedding things to add something to my life. I felt like a new person and people treated me like a new person.     I was a new person as long as my mask was one. I was some one to be respected. I made riding the bus an act of keeping the city free of traffice and smog instead of acknowledging that I didn’t have a car. When I was running the streets it was for exercise and not becuase I was running from the cops.     When I was wearing my mask, Sara loved me. She thought I was deep and soulful. Other women who knew me when the mask was off thought I was just some triflin brotha who had yet to get his life together. My problems never changed, but I just looked different. I knew that but I like be known as being sensitive and soulful, so I began to hate where I cam from.     They couldn’t appreciate the man that I had become. I had stepped it up and become somebody that could be appreciated by the world, but those who knew me seemed to just want to hate on someone who made it.     Too many times I heard “Where yo twists?” and “Why you wearing those glasses?”. The good things was that unless people were informed, they wouldn’t know that “I” was “me”. They would walk right by me and look me directly in the eye wondering “why is that fool lookin at me llike that?”. Maybe I should have said something, but I didn’t want to give away the secret of my mask.

						    Write about a redheaded woman.           So when Vickie came home from the beauty shop with red hair, we knew that she was really seeing Lamont. That had been the sign than any woman was involved with Lamont. He always ended up sweet talking them or lying to them or manipulating them into dying their hair red.     All of us who knew Lamont knew this went back to Lucy. He would never admit it, but it had to be related to the Labor Day programming on channel 9 when they would show I Love Lucy all day. Maybe it was the fact that she could fit so many chocolates in her mouth at one time. Maybe it was her singing or her annoying wail when things went wrong. Whatever it was Lamont was hooked. We always wondered how he knew that Lucy’s hair was red when all the episodes that he saw were in black and white.     All of us knew that Lamont knew that he was color blind and red was one of the few colors that he saw. We think that he imagined Lucy’s red hair and how it matched the color of her lipstick and the red polkadots in her dress.     “So what did he tell you?” I asked Tisha when she came home with red hair.     “He told me how good the red would look with my skin tone. How if I had red hair he would think about me all day long.”     “Did he mention Lucy?”     “Lucy who? What are you talking about?”     “Nothing just forget it...So does he do anything freaky?”     “Simon...we are not going to have this conversation. I can’t believe that you are asking me this stuff. Lamont just thought that I would look better with red hair.”     “Come on Tisha! You gonna act like you don’t know nuthin about all the girls before you who walked around with red hair.”     “I don’t know what you are talking about.” she had that stupid look that told me that she knew about all the other girls but reality has stepped to wayside because I am in love with Lamont. Denial must be in the genetic code of estrogen because they are masters of forgetting crucial things about the man they  love, particularly their character, when it suits them. They can even act completely surprised when they find out that this guy whose obvious issues they had ignored for six months finally overtake him and he cheats on them or ends up in prison. I have always wondered if those tears are heartbreak or shame.     Three months down the line, Lamont had convince Irma to dye her hair red and I was left to wonder what happened to Tisha. Lamont began using a Cuban accent in bed. That didn’t surprise her too much given the rampant Scarface worship that was prevalent in men ages 25 to 40. It took her a couple of times that he was not playing the role of Tony Montana. He was playing the role of Ricky Ricardo. He liked to do a little song and dance as part of their foreplay.     Then things got too much for her. He started asking her to kiss Lil Ricky if you know what I mean and she had some serious objections to oral sex. The fact that he kept referring to his penis in the third person with a name like that, only made her objections to such things even stronger.     That’s when he told her that any other woman would kill for the opportunity to be his Lucy. They all wante d to be stars.     But I think like Desi, he had his problems living up to the whole Ricky Ricardo. I saw Desi and Lucy  and I know how much Desi beat up on Lucy, but then what do expect a guy to do when he selling his soul to the man. Here he is on the tube playing the hispanic man that wouldn’t make the white folks watching fear. I know my share of eses and I have never met one like Ricky Ricardo but I knew all sorts of women who would dye their hair to be with Lamont.

						    The supreme talsman.       The first time that Natalie and I decided to take things to another level, we had been walking after some class on modern literature and we were both tripping off of some Fitzgerald. Some guy from the frat hooked is up for some spring formal and we hit it off. I was too drunk to remember what she looked like, but she was patient when I didn’t recognize her in Modern American Lit the following Tuesday.     We had numerous walks like this after class. I guess the night of the spring formal, she spent the night in my room and nothing happened. I remember walking her home at 5am to save her reputation and she was talking about how much she liked me and wanted to spend more time with me. All I knew was that she didn’t like me enough to have sex, but that was neither here nor there.     “Lets not make this about the music.” she said to me as if I was suppsoed to have some profound understanding at 5:15 in the morning.     Usually I walked her to lunch or whereever she was going after class. She decided that she wanted to take me back to her room. I had waited so long and I wondered what I had done to deserve such a reward. So we get back to her room and she has the I am a little girl who has yet to grow up yet room. She locked her door and turned on some Boyz II Men and took off her shirt. I was appreciating her breasts when I noticed her medallion. It attracted my eyes. It was a piece of bling that I would have never guessed that she was wearing.     “Who’s on your medallion?”     “Athena...she is the greek goddess of hunters.” She smiled and exhaled with a sense of confidence.     “Interesting choice” I smiled I thought that would only mean that there would only make the upcoming events even more interesting.     “I chose her because I need to be strong. The first guy I had sex with used me like a video ho and when everything was said and done, that is what I felt like. Things got crazy so started sleeping with all these guys because I trying to get back with that guy took from me.”     I began to think that I was over my head. I really dug Natalie and we had spent some great time together, but I didn’t know what I was getting into.     “So then I decided that I wasn’t going to get it back from sleeping with guys. Then I bought Athena to remind myself that what I was looking for is in me. Its my supreme talisman and it reminds of who I am and where I have come from.”

						   Another work week begins and I'm as tired as ever. Last night I might have gotten about five hours of sleep.  The night before? Three.  Maybe it is time that I stopped drinking so much. Maybe it is time that I stop fighting growing up and actually accept some of the responsibility that should be the burden of my shoulders.  But I can't. I loath the things I should have to do. I hate that I need to pay for a man to come to my house twice a year to kill the roaches we've got here. Why can't I just kill them when I see them? Why do I have to part with a few hundred dollars a year for a service I'm quite happy to provide with the sole of my shoe? Hell, why can't I get paid a bounty on the roaches I kill.  Ugh. Sleep. That is what I need right now. Even the caffeine of my green tea is not enough to stop me from slumbering.  The work I've got for the week is nothing short of mind numbing. Even if I had a full night's sleep last night, which is far from the reality of things, I'd still find this work soporific. My boss can't seem to be bothered to check on me either. He's off in meetings all day, making this an even more tempting day for a quick siesta under my desk.  But I can't, can I? If I'm caught sleeping at this job I'll be fired before I get the sleepy dust out of my eyes. It's not like I haven’t given the boss reason to can me. Ever since my last raise was less than I expected I've been cutting the corners in terms of my performance. The only reason I am here is that I can occasionally pull some magic out of my ass and save the company a bundle.  Why the hell can't they just be happy with that? Why can't my boss just pay me four times as much for the ten hours of work I actually do all week? We could both dispense with the bullshit of me pretending to work and he pretending to care. The home office is miles away and our branch practically runs itself. There is no reason for either of us to get our panties in a wad trying to look busy for no one who will notice.  Yt665e4  Good lord. It's a good thing I am not driving right now. If you couldn't tell, I just fell asleep again at my desk for the third time today. My forehead probably has the imprint of my keyboard on it by now.  There's a rumor on the floor that the ladies have a couch in their restroom. I wonder if they'd mind a guy sleeping on it for a few hours. Think about it; it's the one place on the whole damn floor that my boss would not be able to find me. I could lay there enjoying a nice nap while he hunts the floor for me.  I don't get it. There should be a couch in the men's room too. Something for us to go sit down on when we've got personal problems too. The fact that the building provides the ladies with a couch but not the men is a sign of the wrongness of the world. Men need naps too!  Honestly though, were I to have access to a couch I probably would have been fired months ago. What I really need to do is to cut back on the booze on work night. Of course, if I don't get my drink on I'd just lay there in my bed unable to sleep as the feelings of self-loathing sweep all over me. Personally; I prefer to drink myself stupid and sleep where I fall.

						    "I walked into the Maverick Bar in Farmington, N.M." (after Gary Snyder)         I walked into the Maverick Bar in Farmington, New Mexico and hoped that nobody would notice me. I had driven for 10 hours straight to get out of LA. I knew that I was going to be adding some color to the bar, but I never realized how much. I walked in and I trembled by the hairs along my neck that stood up out of fear of lynching. My stomach wouldn't let me leave though. It had been 14 hours since I had eaten anything and a bag of chips would cause my stomach to erupt in covulsions that would only lead to some kind of car accident. If I wanted injury and possible death, I would have stayed in LA.        I left town looking for a way into Mexico. Life that I knew in the City of Angels was officially over until somebody decided to be serious about changing things for people of color. I had never been deceived about things. I knew that Lincoln didn't want to free the slaves. I knew JFK didn't want to end segregation. I knew that decisions were always about politics.  The heart of the country was not really down with giving me the rights that I had and were quick to snatch them from me if I got too high on my horse.        The Maverick bar made me forget the reason I had left LA. I was terrified about what would happen if I hung out there too long. I wanted to make sure that let Marshall Dillon that I was only in town for some grub because my stocmach was not going to make the 100 miles to the next Denny's.        I needed to get somewhere where the Patriot Act maybe known, but not rigorously interpretted. All of us on the street of LA never understood how the war on terrorism got turned on us, but we were not surprised. Somewhwere in the middle of changing the elevation of terror alerts, the attorney general decided that bangers like me were domestic terrorists. More than that, he decided that we were more dangerous than all those militias in the Pacific Northwest who are plotting the take over of the country. The only things we were plotting was how to take care of ourselves and the achieve the American Dream.        When the edict came down and the military began to patrol the neighborhood, I had visions of the West Bank and that was not the way that Iw as going out. I knew enough to get out of town because no matter how much I wanted to fight, the army had me outgunned. I was not going to be on the evening news throwing bricks at tanks and listening to people try to persuade me to strap bombs to my body.  Not only do I value my life too much, but I also saw that no matter how many suicide bombers took the path of martyrdom, it didn't change policies and it didn't change opinions.

						       Maybe I had listened to the 1999 album too many times, that is what I told myself. How else could I explain the events of the 25th of May? That was it... I listened to songs about partying like the millennium was going to end. I had listened “Dance Music Sex Romance” too many times. To top things off, Samantha drove a red corvette. I knew it was 2003 and the end of the last millennium passed without any event that validated partying like the end was near.      So when I rolled up to Samantha and told her that I wanted to be her International Lover, and she me if I had a condition of the heart, I knew that we had a connection. A connection that was rooted in Prince songs and the four Coronas that I had before I saw her that night. So we danced because I was all about having a Housequake. The whole time I would mention her how I wanted to take her around the world in a day. She smiled and danced all the more closer to me.     Samantha was not ugly, but on a normal day, I didn’t find her all that attractive. She was too busy trying to follow the rules and cross her “t’s” and dot her “i’s”. I was too busy trying to get all that I squeeze out of my life. I was twisted and I thought that had a lot to do with being drunk or high and reaching some elevated level of awareness.     It was at this heightened level of awareness after 4 Coronas that I saw her and I thought that things could work. When you are at one of these elevated levels of awareness, you can jedi mind trick yourself into all all sorts of things. You can even convince yourself that the girl that you normally don’t pay any attention to has all these hidden qualities that only you see because you have elevated your awareness. The same awareness makes fat girls not as fat and ugly women expose their pretty qualities. I noticed how tan she was and that tan gave her the presence of some Egyptian queen.     So we were grinding and I started mentioning what I would do if I were her girlfriend and I could tell that she was melting.     “Let’s go to my Little Red Corvette.” I knew things were on. I was hoping that I could help see that I was the guy who had gotten over all the stupid stuff that prevented other guys for seeing who she was. I was so glad that she didn’t say Gett Off.     So we took the top off the corvette and we were off. She was my lady cab driver and I was just aching for a kiss.

						   Write about a red convertible.          When Thomas ran out of the bank, he knew that he was in charge. he had gotten out of the bank a whole minute faster than he had planned. He knew that he didn't get every dollar that he could of, but the greedy always get caught. That is what Joseph taught him.         Thomas ran out the bank with the toughest part of his plan to exceute right outside the bank. He was scared because not hiring a getaway driver was greedy. He knew if things were going to go wrong, it was going to be in his efforts to carjack a getaway car.         Thomas ran out of the bank and saw the car that he wanted a convertible red Jaguar. It was definitely conspicuous, but if he handled this right, it would be the perfect car. The car was waiting at a red light and the driver was talking on his cell phone. Thomas rolled up on the car and stuck his gun to the driver's head.         "Oh my God!" the driver blurted.         'Tell them that you will call them back." Thomas said         "I'm gonna have to call you back...I know, but I am going to have to call you back." Then he ended the call and put his cell phone.         "Now let's take a drive."  Thomas smiled because even this part of the plan went off without a hitch.         The car took off and went three blocks when the driver started to lose himself.         "Where are we going? Why are you getting me involved in this?" He was beginning to sweat profusely and his hands were trembling more than his voice.        "This is not going to work. Pull over right there." Thomas barked. The man was fearing the worst. He looked at Thomas and tears began to match the sweat that was running down his forehead. The car pulled over and the driver began to pray for the first time.         "Get the hell out!" Thomas yelled         "What?"         "Get out of the car before I decided that you are a witness that I cannot afford to be alive." With that  the man jumped out of the car, but no before grabbing his briefcase.         Thomas drove two more blocks when he saw a girl sitting at a bus stop. She was reading some book and Thomas couldn't help himself.  He was on the top of the world.         "Hey...you need a ride?"

						   The next two days drove Karrie crazy. This man who made love to her so fine just had her thought process completely a mess and concentrating on work was almost impossible. Luckily the boss was pleased with her project and he left her alone for the rest of the week.On her way home Friday she stopped and got some of her favorite wine coolers. When she got home she put on her favorite nightshirt popped open a wine cooler and flipped through the pages of her high school annual. The pictures brought back warm memories but no clue to her lover. Somewhat frustrated she tossed the book aside and downed a couple more wine coolers. She then couldn't help but reminence how this man fucked her and how satisfied she felt after both encounters. As she thought, her hands started massaging her tits and she began pulling her nipples through the thin material of her nightshirt. Her hands then made there way to her panties and rubbed her crotch spreading her legs wide and she fingered herself through the thin material. She then sat up and stripped herself naked and got into her night stand and got out her vibrating egg. She layed back and turned on the egg and rubbed her toy over her nipples and then guided the toy down her flat tummy and down to her light brown pubes teasing her pussy lips making her hot cunt want the little intruder. After teasing herself enough she spread her pussy lips apart and put her toy right on her clit. She turned the vibrator to high and let out a moan as it's little motor started it's massage on her love nub. it didn't take long for a strong cum go through her. But then she took the egg and pushed it into her hot honey hole and rolled over on her stomach. And as she worked her sugar walls around her little pleasure maker she slid her hands undreneath her and her fingers attacked her clit she came hard and put her into a deep sleep for the night.Finally Satuday night came. She wore her favorite light blue summer dress that showed off her long tanned legs and cut low enough to show off her 38C tits. As she got to The Plaza she went to the main desk and asked for room 17. She asked who the room was registered to but he said he wasn't suppose to say. She went to the room. A note on the door said to go in have a drink and sit in the chair in the middle of the room. Put on the blindfold. She went in and on a stand was a boquet of flowers, a cooler with her favorite wine coolers and beer. She got a cooler sat in the chair and put on the blindfold.She heard the door open and He said "You don't know how glad I am to see you. I've been in love with you since the 10th grade. And when I took a job as a night watchman at our building I couldn't wait to come and say hello. "So why this game" Karrie asked."For one I was thought you would just remeber me as that sweet guy from school. And two when I came to say hi I caught you in the act of pleasuring yourself and the oppurtunity was just too hard to pass up." Karrie's cheeks blushed on the thought of being caught. "Now we did have many classes together. My favorite was 7th period study hall two years in a row." Karrie thought for a moment but it didn't come to her. "Who got you through American Government" And like a giant light bulb she shouted "ANDY" She pulled off the blindfold and she was right. If it wasn't for him she never would have passed. And Andy was one of the sweetest guys in school but never thought of him as a raging hose monster as she has found through their encounters. Now are you going to stay and without hesitation she threw her arms around him kissed him and said yes.Andy had dinner reservations. And after dinner he took her dancing. It was a wonderful evening and Karried was surprised at how Andy was so charasmatic.As they returned to the room Andy gave Karrie a small bag which contained a white teddy and a pair of crotchless panties. She went to the bathroom to put them on. Before coming out she spayed a bit of perfume between her tits and then just above her pussy hairs. As she entered the room Andy was there in silk boxers and the expression on his face spoke anthems. After a drink he led her to the bed. As they kissed his fingers found their was to the opening of her panties and he slowly rubbed her love button. His touch was magical and a small climax went through her body. He then went to the end of the bed and before she knew it he had her pussy over his face. He pulled apart the opening of the panties and his toungue made its way to her swollen pussy lips finding her erct clit.Now Karrie was never been a big fan of sucking cock. But for the first time in her sexual life she never wanted anything more badly than to take this mans tool in her mouth. She pulled down Andy's boxers and his cock bopped right into her face. Her tongue hungrily lapped up his precum and she nibbled on his peehole she took his big purple head into her mouth and with each suck took him deeper into her hot mouth. She tickled his balls with just her finger nails which made Andy let out a low moan of pleasure. And everytime Andy gave a nibble on Karrie's hot clit she returned the favor by letting his big cock out of her mouth and nibblling the end of his at cock. As they sucked each other in unison the orgasm building in Karrie's body made her let go of Andy's cock sit up straight and ride his face until the she exploded her juices all over his face and he happily lapped up all he could. After catching her breath she straddled his big cock and slowly took all nine inches into her steaming cunt. He reached up and gave her hard melons a squeeze and rubbed her nipples with his fingers. She then teasingly just fucked the head of his cock which drove Andy crazy she then slammed her ass down hard and grinding her pussy squeezing his cock with her pussy walls. She felt the head of his cock starting to expand and she rode him as hard as she could til he let out a scream and his spermjuice flooded her pussy and as she collapsed on top of her new lover and ready to sleep in arms. Completely satisfied.

						   "This is my first time here." I said but I didn't think the person at the door was paying any attention. From what I had gathered there were forms to fill out, at the minimum a name and proof of age, before you'd be let in. Perhaps the doorman was just not feeling up to it this evening. In any case, I paid my ten dollars and walked into the dark room, thankful that my ID was not too closely examined.  From the sounds emanating from the room I could tell the place was fairly large. The building itself used to have four apartments; now days the entire top floor was no longer used, as far as I know, and the bottom floor was occupied by this place. Inside was vastly different from standing outside in the parking lot, summoning up courage in the bright summer sun. I'd been to the parking lot three or four times before, but I never got the nerve to come in.  This time the parking lot seemed a little emptier than before, and perhaps that is what got me in the door. Then again, I can only be curious for so long before I just have to know about something. I'd reached that point and now I was inside.  It was pitch black inside, so dark that I could not see my hands in front of my face. I stood still waiting for my eyes to adjust to the place and listening to the sounds coming from all over. I could hear groups of people talking to each other to one side and faint music from in front of me. To my right I could hear a more muffled sound of music; behind me the wall.  I remember coming here all those other times, over the past six months, ever since I'd gotten my driver's license and fake ID. I didn't know how to dress for this sort of thing, having never done this before how would I? I didn't even know anyone who had been here. I'm sure all my friends knew of the place from the ads in the back of the weekly, but coming here was another matter.  My eyes started to make things out. To my left there was a room with couches, I could see a few people standing around chatting. Right in front of me was a door with a bared window in the center of it. I walked to it and pressed the door bell.  "Hello," a woman's voice came from behind the door.  "This is my first time here." I said, again.  "I see. Are you familiar with what we offer here?" The woman's voice again asked. I was not sure where exactly the voice was coming from, it seemed to be close enough to hear but I could see no face.  "In a round about way I guess." I answered.  "There is a $40 room fee which gets you a private room and company for half an hour. After that, you negotiate with the girl." the voice said. It was not matter-of-fact at all, each word seemed saturated with forbidden pleasure.  "Who is the girl?" I ask.  "Your pick sweetie." I saw her face, just a hint of her face. She was Asian, shorter than me with a thin nose and wide lips. She moved away from the window for a brief moment then the lights came on in the room she was in.  There were four girls in the room, all Asian, all in tight silk dresses. I wouldn't say that any of them were knock-outs. Each had the tired look of a person who has given up on their lot in life. Two were too big for their dresses, one too skinny, the last girl looked uncomfortable as if she was wishing to be invisible. Were I at a party none of the girls would have gotten a second look from me but inside this building things were different, so I studied them each in turn.  What does one look for when selecting a girl in a place like this? Age? All of the girls should have been older than me seeing as I used a fake ID to gain entry but I could not be certain. Height? Weight? Breast size? Number of teeth? I didn't know what to think of the girls, so I settled on their hands. I looked at each of the girls hands and decided to pick the girl with the prettiest hands.  "Can I see your hands?" I asked.  Eight hands were held out for me to look at. The girls turned them over, back and front, showing me their painted nails. One girl, the shy one, had small hands like a doll. They looked delicate with short, polished nails. Her hair fell over her shoulders and onto her breasts stopping in the middle of her breast at the neckline of the dress. Her eyes looked up to me, they were light brown set behind long lashes.  "You like her?" The lady was back in the window nodding towards this waif of a girl.  "Yes." I stammered, my mouth dry.  "Forty dollars." A new window opened in the door and the lady's hand was there for the money. I paid her and the door opened. The three girls I hadn't selected were back in plastic chairs around a small TV just around the corner. The girl I selected was gathering towels in a wooden bucket from a cupboard in the corner. She stood, looked me over and motioned that I follow her through another big door.  We walked back to a room decorated like a doctor's waiting room; drab flat colors. In one corner was a tiled shower large enough for two with a short wooden stool and the other side of the room had a twin mattress covered in plastic. The floor had a drain and the door a small chain lock. On two sides of the room there was a small red button with a sign above them reading; "Panic Button." I fought the urge to panic.  "My name is Mai Lee," the girl said. "Would you like a shower first?"  "Yes," I didn't know what I wanted so I took this as a suggestion as to what came next.  Mai Lee reached behind her neck and undid the sole button on the dress. It dropped to the floor. Underneath she was nude except for a small white thong bikini bottom. Her breasts were smooth even curves coming off her shoulders then back towards her abdomen. On top of each was a small, perfectly placed areola with a dark brown nipple the shape of a pencil eraser. She turned on the shower water until the room began to steam then turned and looked at me. "You take off your own clothes."  I disrobed; embarrassed by my nakedness and in awe of hers. She took my hand and pulled me into the shower, turning my back to her. I felt her hands begin to soap my back with the sponge, expertly massaging my shoulders under the water. Mai Lee then knelt behind me and washed each leg from my ankles up. Her small hands running soap across my thighs and butt. She turned me around, still on her knees and found my erection at her eye level.  "Oh..." Mai Lee said. Her hands ran up my legs to my dick, wrapping both hands around the shaft. "Hand job, you cum on my tits; twenty-five dollars. Blow job with condom, fifty." With that, she leaned forward and sucked the head of my dick into her mouth while not breaking eye contact with me.  It was more than I could handle. My knees shook as my body was overcome with an orgasm. At the tender age of sixteen and a half I had just experienced five seconds of my first blow job and it was enough to make me cum. Mai Lee was shocked when I first started shooting. She pulled me out of her mouth and I finished onto her neck as she stroked me. She was spitting onto the shower floor and laughing at the same time.  "This your first time?" Mai Lee laughed as I sank to sit on the stool in the shower.  "Yes." I whispered my body content.  "Next time, you jack off before coming here. We have more fun." Mai Lee stood and turned off the water. Then she got a towel for me and dried me off. "That was quick. You give me twenty, OK?"  "Sure." We got dressed and I gave her the twenty dollars then followed her to the door I was at not ten minutes before. Then out into the bright sunlight, almost blinded after being in the darkness inside. The warm sun felt good in my wet hair. I walked to the car and did something else for the first time in my life; I lit a cigarette. With the smoke filling my lungs I drove out of the parking lot and turned down the road to becoming an adult.

						   I carried it in my pocket.  	Simon didn't know they was there until later than morning when he reached in my pocket to pull out the money for his bus fare. He was terribly embarassed when he pulled my wallet and these black panties with a red ruby Playboy emblem were barely hanging on to the wallet. He quickly snatched them and crammed them back in the pocket. The bus driver smirked and all he could was smile and shrug his shoulders. 	Sometimes he would forget that they were there and when he would walk about, the panties would be in the right pocket of his leather trenchcoat. Living in California, he didn't wear the trench coat all that often. He wore it once or twice a month even in the cold months. But when he did, he was taken back to the night when Teresa wore those black stockings. 	He had never seen her in stockings before. He had loved her bare legs and their softness. That night they went to the opera and she decided to wear an even gown and threw some stockings in with them. Later on he found out she had those panties on.  	When he stumbled them, the panties reminded him of how good things could be and how quickly they could go bad. She had traded the panties for a credit card. She had booked herself on a one way flight to Dallas and Costa Rica. Then she took all the cash advances that she could on her way to the airport. It was up to him to figure out where she went, if vengance or justince meant that much to him. 	It didn't. The credit card company refunded some of the money lost. But he had lost something more important to him than money. He sometimes stumbled across the panties and smiled because he remembered the black stockings and the sex. Sometimes he remembered being robbed and he wanted to throw them away out of anger. But they were always in his pocket.

						    The first rule is ____________.     The first rule is that when you are attracted to someone in the office, you do everything possible to stay out of the way of that person. I didn’t learn the first rule until I had encounter with Lucia in the elevator. After the elevator encounter things seemed to change between the two of us. You cannot just go back to acting like nothing happened. The scary thing is that although it was only the two of us in the elevator, I swore up and down that everyone knew. It was weird for a couple of weeks. Then she showed up in my cubicle with a smile that made me want to pull the emergency button in the elevator again.    “Fish can I talk to you for a second?” “Yeah...what’s up?” I thought this was good. Maybe there would be some closure from the events in the elevator. She told me that she wanted to meet for drinks after work and then she would be able to talk to me. I agreed to meet her, but I spent the rest of the day thinking about what she would say and how I would respond. I ran so many scenarios in my head. Most of them ended with us finding another elevator and rekindling things. I thought about taking her back to my place and blindfolfding her with my tie and taking advantage of her. When I got to the bar, I had to sit around for 40 minutes waitng for her while I consumed two beers. She called at some point to tell me that she was going to be a little late. Something had to get out of the office that night. Her phone call prompted the second beer. When she finally showed up, I was feeling good and she looked incredible. I can tell that she took a few minutes to fix herself up before she headed for the bar. She walked in and kissed me on the cheek and I was sent into a number of questions about the kiss. We smalled talked about out days and then she jumped right into things. “I really had a good time with you in the elevator and I have been thinking about you.” she said. I tried to hold back the big smile that was trying to burst to the surface of my face. I took a deep breath and a sip from my third beer.    “Yeah...I had a good time also.”    “I think that you are someone very special.”    “Thanks...I dig you also.” “Fish can I ask you something?” I froze for a minute. I knew that this was why she had wanted to meet. She wanted to take things to another level. I was taken aback because we had never even been on a date yet. However she didn’t want to take things to another level yet. She wanted me to break the second rule while she hinted at taking things to another level int he future. She told me how much she needed some money for a nose job. Giving her money would definitely violate the second rule and who knows if that would lead me to the third rule.

						   Two weeks had past since Karrie had the wildest sex expierence of her life. She purposely stayed late 3 times to see if her lover would return. But he did not and she was ready to hang it up as one of those once in a lifetime happenings.Her boss was on her ass about a project that needed to be done by the end of the week and she was determined to get it in early even if she had to stay until midnight Wednesday to get it done. Then she could cruise on Thursday and Friday with the usual business to take care of heading into the weekend.Karrie's work went much quicker than she thought and around 9:00 she was ready to make her final copies and then head home to a hot bath and glass of wine. As she stood by the copier the voice was back. "Hello again" he said "Don't turn around". As much as she wanted to see this man the thought of her last encounter with him froze her and she just placed her hands on the copier. "I though you weren't coming back" She said."Oh I had every intention to come back to see you." He said and as he spoke the blindfold was once again placed over Karrie's eyes.Karrie asked several questions in a row but was given no answer as his hands rubbed her shoulders, down her back and across her ass. He then turned her around and held her close. He then said " All your questions will be answered in time. But not now. But I will tell you that I'm a long time admierer." He then kissed her very gently with just the tip of his tounge brushing hers leaving her weak in the knees. He then took her hand and led her to an office where he shut and locked the door.He led her to a desk and lifted her up to sit on it. She then felt his fingers fumble with her hair and then brushed her cheeks and across her lips. Like last time she heard that familiar hum of approval. He kissed her again firmer this time with his tounge deeper and she responded by curling her tounge around his. Karrie then felt his fingers begin to unbutton her blouse. He slowly pushed her blouse off her shoulders and it fell onto the desk. Her bra was easily removed and his hands slid slowly around her slim waiste and up to her huge orbs squeezing them firmly and flicking her dark hardened nipples making her let out a slow long moan. He then layed her back on the desk and he filled his hungry mouth with her huge nipple sucking and nibbling the tastey treat. While running a hand across her crotch and she instantly pushed her pussy up against his hand. Knowing she was under his control. After getting his feed of her big tits he undid her pants and quickly removed them taking her panties at the same time. He then backed off and she new he was stripping. He then told Karrie to show him her pussy. She slowly spread her legs showing her swollen pussy lips with her clit peeking out. He then ordered her pull her lips apart. And she did revealing her leaking honey hole to him. She then felt his firm hands make their way up from her ankles, caressing her calves and inner thighs. He pulled her up from the desk and kissed her firmly and his fuck finger stoking her clit slowly round and round. As they kissed her hands caressed his firm and hairy chest and made her way down his flat stomach. She was impressed with muscle tone. As he kept with his finger massage on her clit driving her into a frenzy her hand found his huge erect cock at least 9 ot 10 inches of manhood there Karrie thought to herself. She was brought out of her thought as he plunged his finger deep into her drenched pussy that made her cum as she pumped her pussy walls around those magic fingers. He then pushed her back onto the desk and he grabbed both ankles speading her legs wide as they would go and she felt the large purple head of his monster cock at the entrance of her hot hole. He began fucking her with just the head of his cock inside her while a finger was rubbing her clit. She instantly came from the combination and he could feel her pussy pulling him in as she wanted more of his giant snake.He then grabbed her ankles and shoved all 9 inches into her as hard as he could that made her wail in ecstacy and her eyes roll to the back of her head. After another hard orgasm or two as Karrie lost count. He pulled out of her as the orgasms passed through her quivering body. She felt his hands upon her again and he carried her to a couch and layed her down. He kissed her gently as he settled down between her legs and re- entered her. And with the gentleness of big old teddy bear he made love to her. His huge cock slowly pumping in and out of her pussy. His kisses warm and gentle. Her legs locked around his buttocks. As another cum was building in her ravaged body she could feel the head of his cock expanding knowing that he was about to blow his hot juices. He whispered cum with me Karrie and with that he shot his wad and she came with him as ordered as this man now owns her body completely.Laying exhausted she asked to remove the blindfold but he said no. Our next meeting everything wil be known he promised. He kissed her gently good night dressed and left. Karrie got up and found her clothes. As she went to the desk for her bra and blouse she found an envlope. She opened it and all it said was Room 17 The Plaza Hotel. Satuday at 8:00. She could hardly wait.

						   I carried it in my pocket.       “Why does a born again Christian carry a Star of David in his pocket?” she asked and smirked and squinted her eyes with that look that always killed him softly.     “Well because my father was Jewish.” he said looking at he with a intensity that indicated to her that this was not a laughing matter. He was more concerned about how she would react to such a statement.     “Your dad is Jewish...”     “Yeah” he was even firmer.     “But you don’t look Jewish. You always talk about being black.” she softened her eyes in an effort to soften his demeanor.     “Well I am mixed. In fact, this star is all I have from my dad.” he relaxed thinking that maybe he was too harsh.     “Did you guys have a good relationship?”     “We didn’t have much of a relationship. My folks split up before I have memories. I see his picture and I feel  a connection, but I don’t know the guy.”     “So what’s up with the star?”     “Well I keep in my pocket and it pricks me through the cloth two or three times a day and I am reminded that not everything is what it seems.” he smiled     “Yeah look at me...some people think that I am some kind of bitch but I am not.” she moved close to him and looked him deep in the eyes. He wasn’t sure what to make of this gesture. She definitely wasn’t what she appeared to be on a moment by moment basis. He resigned not to read her, but just let whatever was going to happen just happen.     “Yeah...you are not what you appear to be, but what are you then?” She moved closer to him and then she began to kiss his neck.     “I am soft” and she made up her hands under his shirt and began to massage his back and rubbed his chest. “I am sensitive” she nibble d on his earlobe. “and I like to play rough” she squeezed his right buttock.

						   I thought I would start by adding the old stuff, and then update with new work from there.  Enjoy!  Mystery Man  While at work Karrie had this twinge of horniness is her pussy all day. It's been awhile since the last time she gotten laid and each day her feeling of needing a good fucking was getting stronger. But today was worse and everytime she thought of sneaking off to give her self a quick trip to the bathroom to relive her sexual pressure something came up and blew the chance. By 5:00 the ache in her pussy was too much to bear. Her co worker asked if she was ready to head home but Karrie said she was going to finish up some filing first. As she heard Melissa leave she went out in the hall to make sure that no one was around.She headed back to her desk lifted her skirt and slid off her panties which were soaked from her hot leaking juices. She sat in her office chair and rested her feet on her desk spreading her legs and sliding her finger to her wet snatch. Just from the slightest graze of her swollen pussy lips sent a shiver of excitement through her body. Her fingers went straight to her honey hole circling just the outside of it getting the needed juices to take up to her swollen clit. As she started to stroke her love nub her hips instantly started moving in rythm with each stroke of her clit. As her fingers were doing there magic she was suddenly brought out of her sexual trance by a noise behind her. She quickly sat up in her chair, but before turning around she heard a voice say "Finish what you started. And don't turn around." At first she said no but the voice said "go ahead and finish." Strangley she did as she was told. Leaned back in her chair spread her legs and her fingers did their job as she came hard from the massage. As she gathered herself the voice from behind told her not to turn around and stay calm he wasn't going to hurt her. At this time she saw a man's tie in front of her that covered her eyes and was gently but firmly tied to stay in place.Firm hands were place upon her shoulders as he lifted her out of her chair. His hands moved down her back and around her waist. He reached for the hand that administered her massage and felt his wet tounge lick the juices from her wet pussy.His hand then slid around her waist and undid the button of her skirt and letting it fall to the floor. She then felt his hands caress her firm ass and a slight moan of approval made her pussy tingle. Then she felt a finger trace the crack of her ass and down to her pussy lips where he buried his finger deep into her hot box. After he removed it he heard him suck his finger and another hum of approval was heard. He then suddenly turned her around and placed her on her desk. He spread her legs and was quickly on his knees with his face buried in her wet snatch. She felt his magical tounge dance in and out of her honey hole making her wanting to let out a scream of pleasure but then he moved to her clit sucking and nibbling it hard making her buck up against his face until she came and her pussy juices shot out all over her mysterious lovers face. He then got up and she could hear the unbuckling of his belt and the slow sound of his pants being unzipped. Which made her pussy ache from anticipation. Again she felt his firm hands upon her turning her around and bending her over her desk.She felt the head of his cock trace the crack of her ass. He spread her buttcheeks and she felt his thick precum lubricating her asshole. But then he slowly moved down to her hot aching hole and felt the biggest cock she ever had being inserted which made her moan with pleasure. After four or five slow strokes he grabbed her hips and lowered himself into her chair. And he said ride me you hot cunt and with that Karrie road that lovestick like no tomorrow. Slamming her ass down on that meatstick. She could feel the head of that moster gettting ready to blow and she sat on his cock hard as he let out a moan and what seemed like a gallon of cum shot out of his cock into her fuckbox.She slumped onto her desk in total exhaustion and satisfaction. She felt his hands on her shoulders and he lowered her into her chair. With a light kiss on her cheek told her not to turn around after removing the tie and try to stay late again real soon. And with that he was gone. Some late night filing may be in the near future.

						    A mountain rose _____________.         A mountain rose in the intersection, and as the car piled one on top of the other, I watched the carnage with the faintest idea of what was going on. I felt the rumble and crash of the first car as it rolled over and slid into the intersection. The screeching of metal as it slid across the asphalt and the crash as it hit another car that had frozen in the middle of the intersection. Somehow I expected that to be it, yet cars kept coming out of nowhere and crashing into what I would have to call Satan’s sculpture.     After the 12th car hit the pile I knew that something was up. I didn’t know exactly how to explain what was going on, but I knew that this was beyond an accident. There was some force at work. The burning air smelled of evil and was laced with oil and wiper fluid. Tears streamed from my eyes partly from the violence of the air and part from the devastation that even the smoke couldn’t blind me from.     I heard the sirens and looked down each path of the intersection and realized that the police and firemen were running to the scene because their vehicles could not reach the intersection.     The mountain rose in the intersection and spilled bodies that crawled away from everything coughing and asking God why.

						   	We all tried to tell Phin that the girl was trouble. We even tried to convince her that he was nothing. We even attempted to have James try to make a run at her to distract her from my man Phin. Nothing worked. 	So we put the word out to see what we could find about her and things came back shady as hell. We gound out things about Carmela Torres that we couldn't even imagine. She had some ex-football player looking for her because of a missing Mercedes-Benz. She had even turned some tricks to pay the bills. All this was not what we wanted to hear, but it was not surprising also. She had eyes that looked through you because she had seen too much in this life already. The thing that made me suspicious was that she called herself C-Diddy. 	Phin couldn't stop talking about the girl and how she was perfection. She definitely would be in the eye candy store, but at the same time she seemed shady. He would tell us how they had so much in common and how dhe was strong where he was weak. They were so perfect that they could finish each other's sentences. We knew he was naÃ¯ve. He had done the best he could to avoid relationships while he was in college and law school. I think passing the bar was a rite of passage for him. He knew that he could invest himself in someone.It was our job to make sure that he invested himself in the right person.

						     Write about an invitation refused.     All I had to buy was some Aleve for the wife’s headache. It was late enough for me to go in and out of the grocery store without having to traverse through crowds and lines and elderly women whow were in search of double coupon saving. I grabbed the Alve and since I was so close to the condom aisle, I decided to see if there was anything new that  I wanted to give a shot.     I grabbed a pack of strawberry flavored condoms for the heck of it.Who knows if the wife would play along, but it couldn’t hurt.  I was strolling to the front of the store and I was in grocery heaven. There was relatively no one roaming the aisles. The store was a little chilly for my taste but I am sure that people buying strwberries and bananas were grateful for the temperature.     I got in line. The store was so empty that there were only two. I chose the line with three people instead of the line with one person who seemed to be pruchasing 750 cans of tuna. What one man does with 750 cans couldn’t be good. For some reason I could see this guy trying to bath in a big vat of tuna fish.      I finally got to put my bottle of Aleve and my box of condoms down. I had plenty of room so I put down the divider so that the person behind me could put down their stuff.     “Thank you.” came from the voice of a woman who tone made me tremble. It was a “thank you” that was more than polite and was dipped in seduction. I said “you’re welcome” and I turned to find an Asian woman in her late 30’s who face showed age, but the rest of her looke d intriguing. I was frightened. She smiled at me and I knew that something could happen. I knew that she was extending me an invitation to test her gratitude and see how thankful she was. I was intrigued to see what she would do to thank me.      But I refused her invitation with silence. I didn’t turn around again. I didn’t look at her when I paid for my Aleve and condoms. In fact I hoped that she could see my wedding ring as I used my ring finger to punch in my  PIN code into the payment machine. When I was given my badg and my receipt, I streaked for my car and the safety of monogamous home.

      I am so fucking horny right now, my pussy is drenched and throbbing.  I was going through some old papers and found an old letter Rick wrote to me, telling me how hot I made him and how badly he wanted to pound my cunt.  My first instinct was to pleasure myself, indulging in multiple orgasms to quench my thirst.  But the good wife in me tells me to wait for Rick to come home so I can greet him at the door naked, rip off his pants and slick his dick with my mouth before straddling it with my pussy.  Then of course, Rick could fuck me any way he chose fit.  It so hard to be good sometimes!  Especially with a vivid imagination like mine!

      Rick was a first for me for nearly every naughty thing imaginable, and he himself was completely pure until I got my hands on him.  Not long after we had been dating, we were messing around when he asked to watch me masturbate.  At the time I was 17, and had NEVER touched myself that way.  I didn't even know how!  I had never even had an orgasm yet at that point, I wasn't even sure what they were!  So needless to say, I was shocked by his request, and laughed it off.  As much as I enjoyed to watch him stroke his cock and grab himself, I should have understood why he wanted to see me do the same for him.  He didn't ask again, and we found other things to keep busy with.  Just recently, I recalled his earlier request, and having MUCH more knowledge of my nether regions, I decided to grant it for him.  We were watching television in bed one night, with his head by the pillows, and myself turned around with my head at the foot of the bed.  I was wearing a nightgown with no underwear or panties on underneath.  When he slipped his hand under my gown to playfully slap my ass, I flipped over and held his hand against my pussy.  Pulling the gown up to my hips and spreading my legs open for him to see, I took his fingers and guided them into me, getting his fingers wet with my juices and then wetting my own fingers with his.  When he realized his good view, he sat up and got his head very close to me, watching as I rubbed my clit with my fingers.  He couldn't resist licking me, and thoroughly soaked my cunt and sucked the honey from my fingers.  I circled my finger on his tongue as he spread my legs even further, looking deep inside of me, plunging a finger into my hole and savoring the taste as he licked it clean. I massaged my clit to climax, and was savoring the momennt when he ripped off his shorts, unveiling his raging hard dick.  I smiled knowing that I had turned him on so much.  Then he thrust himself deep inside me, fucking my pussy, pounding me so hard I could barely breath.  I felt his balls slapping my ass as he grabbed my ankles and spread me open, staring down at his cock fucking my pussy until he finally exploded.  It was an amazing experience.  We've played like this a few times since, and the action just keeps getting hotter and hotter.  I think I'll go touch up my bikini line and perhaps we'll explore a little more tonight.

      What is it about lying out in the sun that brings about a euphoric drunkenness in me?  I literally get washed over in a hypnotic sense of happiness and well being.  My body tingles as the warmth kisses my skin, bringing out a deep bronze color in appreciation.  I have a new understanding of the kitty that falls asleep in the sun drenched window sill.  I love the summer.

      Our four year wedding anniversary is coming up next month, and Rick and I have been talking about staying in a luxury hotel room for the night.  We found one that sounds heavenly, with a private jacuzzi, plush pillow top mattresses with feather beds on top and even towel warmers for the expensive egyptian cotton towels they provide.  They rinse the bedding in lavender scented water to help relax you, and even have their own award winning chef who is willing to take any challenge you may have for him.  I must say I'm intrigued.  But for the high end price tag, we would have to spend every last minute we pay for living it up in that room!  It would be nice though, to step out of the burbs for a day, away from the baby, with only my husband and myself to think about.  And I'm quite sure we would take care of eachother very well.  Now to call the sitter...

      Its funny how those who don't know the intended meaning for 'hump day' instantly think of deliciously naughty things.  On that thought, heres a yummy little story for your hump day enjoyment.  Mystery Man  While at work Karrie had this twinge of horniness is her pussy all day. It's been awhile since the last time she gotten laid and each day her feeling of needing a good fucking was getting stronger. But today was worse and everytime she thought of sneaking off to give her self a quick trip to the bathroom to relive her sexual pressure something came up and blew the chance.   By 5:00 the ache in her pussy was too much to bear. Her co worker asked if she was ready to head home but Karrie said she was going to finish up some filing first. As she heard Melissa leave she went out in the hall to make sure that no one was around. She headed back to her desk lifted her skirt and slid off her panties which were soaked from her hot leaking juices. She sat in her office chair and rested her feet on her desk spreading her legs and sliding her finger to her wet snatch. Just from the slightest graze of her swollen pussy lips sent a shiver of excitement through her body. Her fingers went straight to her honey hole circling just the outside of it getting the needed juices to take up to her swollen clit. As she started to stroke her love nub her hips instantly started moving in rythm with each stroke of her clit. As her fingers were doing there magic she was suddenly brought out of her sexual trance by a noise behind her.   She quickly sat up in her chair, but before turning around she heard a voice say "Finish what you started. And don't turn around." At first she said no but the voice said "go ahead and finish." Strangley she did as she was told. Leaned back in her chair spread her legs and her fingers did their job as she came hard from the massage.   As she gathered herself the voice from behind told her not to turn around and stay calm he wasn't going to hurt her. At this time she saw a man's tie in front of her that covered her eyes and was gently but firmly tied to stay in place.  Firm hands were place upon her shoulders as he lifted her out of her chair. His hands moved down her back and around her waist. He reached for the hand that administered her massage and felt his wet tounge lick the juices from her wet pussy.  His hand then slid around her waist and undid the button of her skirt and letting it fall to the floor. She then felt his hands caress her firm ass and a slight moan of approval made her pussy tingle. Then she felt a finger trace the crack of her ass and down to her pussy lips where he buried his finger deep into her hot box. After he removed it he heard him suck his finger and another hum of approval was heard. He then suddenly turned her around and placed her on her desk. He spread her legs and was quickly on his knees with his face buried in her wet snatch. She felt his magical tounge dance in and out of her honey hole making her wanting to let out a scream of pleasure but then he moved to her clit sucking and nibbling it hard making her buck up against his face until she came and her pussy juices shot out all over her mysterious lovers face.   He then got up and she could hear the unbuckling of his belt and the slow sound of his pants being unzipped. Which made her pussy ache from anticipation. Again she felt his firm hands upon her turning her around and bending her over her desk.  She felt the head of his cock trace the crack of her ass. He spread her buttcheeks and she felt his thick precum lubricating her asshole. But then he slowly moved down to her hot aching hole and felt the biggest cock she ever had being inserted which made her moan with pleasure. After four or five slow strokes he grabbed her hips and lowered himself into her chair. And he said ride me you hot cunt and with that Karrie road that lovestick like no tomorrow. Slamming her ass down on that meatstick. She could feel the head of that moster gettting ready to blow and she sat on his cock hard as he let out a moan and what seemed like a gallon of cum shot out of his cock into her fuckbox.  She slumped onto her desk in total exhaustion and satisfaction. She felt his hands on her shoulders and he lowered her into her chair. With a light kiss on her cheek told her not to turn around after removing the tie and try to stay late again real soon. And with that he was gone. Some late night filing may be in the near future.    Mmmmmmmm....off to play now!

      I wonder if the feminist movement didn't stem from bad sex?  I mean, honestly, one good hard take control fuck from my husband, and instantly I sound like June Cleaver.  "Yes dear.  Whatever you say dear.  May I fetch your pipe and slippers?"  The feminists just went too long without a decent lay and of course they got pissed!!  And then there was all the bra burning, which of course resulted in seeing bouncy boobs and nipples all over the place.  Just try to tell me that that wasn't a desperate attempt to stop the insanity.  It was basically an invitation.  "See my tits?  Wanna squish your face between them and bite my nipples?  Take me!!"  The longer they went with out the love, the more bitter they became.  I completely understand now.

      How is it, that my husband finds the need to.....how should I word this?  Aww hell.  Lets just say it.  Jerk off.  I guess I could have chosen more eloquent words, but.....  Anyway, he is married to a woman who is ready and raring to go whenever he is, on top of being adventurous and even enjoying oral sex.  So what gives?!  How do I know he does it?  Good question.  Honestly I just assumed everyone did it, and I have no problem with it except for one disgusting little fact.  He leaves...evidence behind.  I'll get out of the shower and lie down on the bed, grabbing a pillow, only to find a huge fresh stain on said pillow.  This has happened more than once.  Why wouldn't he clean up the mess?  Does every guy do it this way?  I'm sorry, but thats gross.  And on top of it, a bit insulting.  Instead of a nice afternoon romp, I'm left cleaning up his solo act.  It doesn't matter how often or how wild and crazy the sex is, he still leaves his signature all over the place, like a dog marking territory.  Any tips on how to solve this touchy matter would be greatly appreciated!

      I've enjoyed the sneak peek into others peoples lives by reading various blogs and have always told myself that I should one day repay the favor.  So here I am!  I'm a 24 year old married stay at home mom.  I thought long and hard about how to go about addressing myself and my husband on this blog, and have decided to go by different names.  My initial thought was to use some really hot sexy names, but thought they may be a bit out of character.  So I just chose my favorite tv couple, Lucy and Ricky.  (which is actually funny because I've been known to call my husband Ricky Retardo, lovingly of course! =0)  )  Anyway, I'm new to all of this, and I'm sure my blog will show it at first.  I'm a virgin to all this!  You must break me in gently!  *wink wink*  I plan to talk about anything and everything, so I'm sure there will be quite an array of topics here.  And so ends my first post.  Until we meet again.... *blows kiss*

      Today was the company picnic. The weather was perfect for it, sunny and not too terribly hot or humid. I met one of Rick's co-workers named Hans. Well, not really Hans, but a name that is comparable to Hans. By that, what I suppose I mean to say, is that he has a name that implies a certain image to come to mind when you hear the name. The image that the name suggests is not at all what Hans looked like. Whenever Rick has spoken about Hans, I pictured a little middle aged or older man with a German or otherwise similar background. You know, fair skin, perhaps crabby. The name just really sounds like a crabby old man. Anyway, so we walk up to this guy, Hans, and Rick introduces me and the son. Well, as it turns out, Hans is fucking   HOT.   Literally tall dark and handsome. Rick isn't sure of his ethnicity, but the common belief is that he is perhaps Indian or otherwise middle eastern. It sounds terrible, but I just couldn't keep my eyes off of him. Rick didn't have much chance to notice, as he was mingling, introducing the boy to his co-workers and such.  Don't get me wrong. I love my husband dearly, and would never ever cheat on him or otherwise be unfaithful. I'm just not that type of girl! ;0) But, my God, if I was!  Hans was quite the flirt. I'd say hes either in his late twenties or maybe early thirties. He was very sweet, and intelligent, which made for good conversation, and he gave me the once over a couple of times as we talked. "Rick is a lucky man," he said to me. I couldn't help but giggle when the object of my temporary affection complimented me. I felt like a school girl, crushing on him as I did. I'd be lying if I said I didn't fantasize about sneaking off to the woods with him, giving in to my urges. Perhaps a story shall emerge from that very idea....mmmm. I'm tingly at the mere thought!  Enough of that foolishness! lol  Speaking of school girls, I was shocked at some of the attire I saw the young girls wearing today. 11 and twelve year olds wearing skin tight low cut belly baring tops, and shorts so short their ass cheeks were hanging out. These girls were so young! It was awful! What was worse, was that a few of the nastier men made sexual comments about some of these girls. Are you kidding me?! They are still babies! How did their parents let them leave the house looking like that? Disgusting.  Seeing those girls made me wonder about how things would be if we had a daughter. It scares me to think of all the things she could be exposed to.  I was extremely boy crazy when I was younger. (perhaps even still today after meeting Hans!) I can remember my first crush when I was in preschool. Yes, preschool. When I was eight, I used to sneak my dad's Playboy's into my room when nobody was home, looking at the pictures and reading the cartoons. Later at age 12, I used to sneak into my dad's office in the basement and watch tapes from his hidden porn collection. This was when I found out that sex involved penetration. Yes, sex ed had failed me, I had no clue such things were possible, but then why should I? I was just a baby, too young to have any reason to know about these things. I think kids are exposed to sex too soon these days. I suppose this is why I'm scared to have a daughter. I can't help but wonder though, how I might have actually figured out about how sex worked, had I not viewed those tapes when I did. I suppose I would have been quite shocked when I lost my virginity! lol  If Rick weren't here right now, I believe I would need a cold shower to make me forget about Hans. Instead, I believe I'll take a hot bath and focus my heightened sexual energy on my loving husband.

      We laid in bed watching tv last night.&nbsp; I rested my head on Rick's chest, inhaling the fresh soap and cologne on his just washed skin.&nbsp; My fingers traced circles on his torso and softly twisted the hair between my fingers.&nbsp; He squeezed me close to him, and I noticed movement from his boxers.&nbsp; What is it about a penis coming to life that is so amazingly hot?&nbsp; My heart beat quickened, as I pretended not to notice.&nbsp; I continued to stroke his chest with my finger tips, and rubbed myself closer to him, seeing what actions brought on greater movements from down below.&nbsp; It was quite an exciting game!&nbsp; He leaned down to kiss me, and then decided to torture me with a tickle game.  &nbsp;   I hate to be tickled.  &nbsp; Yes, I laugh, because it tickles!&nbsp; But I HATE it!&nbsp; I hate the feeling of having absolutely no control over my body.&nbsp; Of my muscles going limp, making me unable to defend myself.&nbsp; Of the empty, silent laugh, due to not being able to breathe or catch my breath.&nbsp; Its torture, but he just thinks its hilarious, and doesn't understand how I can be laughing hysterically one minute and be pissed the next.&nbsp; Tickling is evil.&nbsp; But I digress.  The tickling turned into playful wrestling, and I ended up pinning his arms down and sitting on top of him, mostly to protect myself from&nbsp;anymore possible tickle attacks.&nbsp; I felt his dick moving underneath me,&nbsp;and leaned down to kiss him.&nbsp; He kissed rather roughly, and bit my bottom lip&nbsp;quite hard.&nbsp; The pain only seemed to add to the pleasure though, and soon his hands were free, kneading my breasts and pulling them down to his mouth where he teased them with his tongue before grazing them with his teeth.&nbsp; &nbsp; He grew harder still beneath me.&nbsp; I started to climb off and he quickly moved his knee to my crotch.&nbsp; The hardness and the pressure was intoxicating, and I began to grind my pussy against him, being met with movement of his own.&nbsp; I came almost instantly.&nbsp;   Dismounting his knee, I reached down and pulled his dick out through the fly of his boxers and began circling the head with my tongue before plunging it deep into my mouth.&nbsp; I built up a quick movement, thouroughly wetting his shaft.&nbsp; I felt Rick moving my hair aside so he could watch me.&nbsp; I slowed my movement, making sure he saw the complete length coming in and out of my mouth, along with my tongue, licking and lapping at him.&nbsp; He made approving noises, some moans and sighs and a few "Oh fuck yeah.&nbsp; Mmm&nbsp; That feels so fucking good."&nbsp; Those words only encourage me.&nbsp; ;0)&nbsp;   With his shaft fully soaked with my spit, and my hand assisting, I picked up speed, fucking his cock with my mouth.&nbsp; I felt his balls tighten and pull up close to his body, as his dick grew that extra degree of hardness just before coming.&nbsp; As he came, I made sure he could see himself exploding on my tongue.&nbsp; He watched as much as he could before his eyes squeezed shut and the last spurt left him.&nbsp; I kissed the tip of his dick before coming up and again resting my head on his chest, enjoying the scent of fresh soap and colonge and the faint new smell of sex.&nbsp;   Its funny how certain words trigger weird things to pop in your head.&nbsp; When I typed 'dismounting', I immediatly thought of this funny clip from a commercial I saw last night for that new show on NBC, 'Father of the Pride'.&nbsp; The lion voiced by John Goodman is talking to what I guess is his wife and says, "It may be 9 o'clock in New York, but its mountin' time here."&nbsp; lol&nbsp; Get it?&nbsp; Mountain time?&nbsp; Mounting time?&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Okay, Rick thought it was stupid too, but damn it, I laughed!&nbsp;

      Imagine, if you will, the perfect setting for a wonderful evening.&nbsp; Son was already tucked into bed and sleeping when Rick calls to tell me he'll be home within the hour.&nbsp; Plenty of time to slip into something..festive, light some candles, get some good mood music on, and set the table for the candle light dinner I had planned.&nbsp; I had champagne in an ice bucket and a tray of chocolate covered strawberries that I had made my&nbsp;self, earlier in the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Rick pulls up, just as the last candle is lit.&nbsp; Perfect.&nbsp; I take one last look in the mirror, then go to meet him at the&nbsp;door.&nbsp; Hes got two dozen red long stemmed roses, gorgeous and very fragrant.&nbsp; He wraps his arm around my waist, &nbsp;pulling me closer to him, &nbsp;smiling and saying,"Happy anniversary, babydoll", before&nbsp;swooping down for a kiss.&nbsp; Our lips meet, soft and loving at first, and then with more passion, as I wrap my arms around Rick's neck and run my finger tips through his hair.&nbsp;   "You're looking especially hot today," he comments as he steps back, looking at my carefully chosen lingerie, a black&nbsp;satin chemise with a lace up garter belt and thigh high stockings, topped with a satin kimono style robe and some of Rick's favorite fuck-me-pumps on my toes.&nbsp; He traces his fingers along my cheek, and touches my lips.&nbsp; I kiss his finger before he traces it down my neck and across my cleavage.&nbsp; "Are you hungry?", I ask, "I've made you a candle light dinner with some chocolate covered strawberries for dessert."&nbsp; "Famished," is Rick's reply, as he heads to the kitchen with the roses.&nbsp; "But&nbsp; lets get these in some water first."&nbsp; I follow him, grabbing a vase from the dining room curio.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hand him the vase to fill and lean against the counter, admiring the gorgeous flowers.&nbsp; Rick reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small box, placing it on the counter next to me.&nbsp; "Whats this?," I ask,&nbsp;picking up the box.&nbsp; "Open it and find out."&nbsp; Inside is a gorgeous diamond eternity band.&nbsp; "Its beautiful!", I exclaim, pulling out the ring and placing it on my finger.&nbsp; Rick sets the filled vase on the counter and smiles.&nbsp; "I'm glad&nbsp;you like it."&nbsp; I grab his hand, pulling him close to me and kiss him.&nbsp; "I'm starving," he reminds me.&nbsp; As I start to lead him into the dining room, he stops me.&nbsp;&nbsp;  With his hands around my waist, he picks me up and sets me on the kitchen counter.&nbsp; Surprised, I give him a puzzled look.&nbsp; Before I can say a word, I feel the rough texture of his hands on the smooth skin of my inner thighs.&nbsp; He parts my legs, pushing my panties aside.&nbsp; I lean back on the counter, giving him full access to do as he pleases.&nbsp; I feel his warm breath on me, as his tongue opens up my slit.&nbsp; Gently at first, and then he dives in hungrily, humming against my lips, sending shivers down my spine.&nbsp; I had been wanting this for days, and it seemed like only seconds before I was coming into his mouth.&nbsp; He licked up my juices before coming up for a kiss.&nbsp; I tasted my honey on his tongue, as I reached down to undo his belt and pants, freeing him.  Jumping down from the counter, I quickly got down on my knees, pulling his dick out from his boxers and wrapping my mouth around it.&nbsp; Rick gasped in pleasure, watching as I slid his full length deep inside my mouth and throat.&nbsp; I looked up at him, seeing the approval in his facial expression, his dick pulsing against my tongue.&nbsp; He put his hands on my head, guiding me, as he fucked my mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, he pulls out and&nbsp;says, "I want to fuck your pussy."&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing my shy, conservative husband talk like that drives me wild.&nbsp; "In here?" I ask, "Or should we go to the bedroom?"&nbsp; He helps me up and leads me upstairs to the bedroom, where I already had music playing and candles lit.&nbsp;&nbsp;  As I walk towards the bed,&nbsp;he kisses my neck, and pulls off my robe.&nbsp; His hand slides up my chemise and grabs my ass before I feel his arm around my waist, his other hand on my back, pushing me down on the bed, exposing my ass and pussy to him.&nbsp; "Climb up", he instructs, and I climb on the bed, staying on my knees.&nbsp; He quickly runs his tongue over my slit once more, and reaches up, pinching my clit between his fingers.&nbsp; "Mmmmm", I let out, before he suddenly rams his cock, deep into my cunt, heavy balls slapping up against my lips from the force.&nbsp; "Oh fuck!" I exclaim.&nbsp; Ricks hands grasp my hips as he both pulls me onto him and thrusts at the same time.&nbsp; This position always has me very verbal, sounding like a porn star, as I moan and purr "Oh yeah, baby!&nbsp; Fuck me!&nbsp; Your dick is so fucking hard!&nbsp; Ohhh!&nbsp; Yeah that feels good.&nbsp; Ohhh!&nbsp; Fuck!"  I hear Rick's grunts and know he about to come.&nbsp; His pounding quickens, the sound of his pelvis hitting my ass gets louder, and then he pulls out, exploding all over my ass and pussy before he slaps my ass and collapses on the bed next to me.&nbsp;   A few moments pass, then I ask him, "Are you still famished?&nbsp; I made you a big dinner."&nbsp; Smiling, he replies, "I could eat some more."&nbsp; I feel his hand on my mound as he positions himself between my legs.&nbsp;   That would have been a hot anniversary, huh?&nbsp; Too bad it didn't happen that way.&nbsp; Rick came home late and with a sore back.&nbsp; He ate dinner and we fed each other the chocolate covered strawberries with some champagne before he declared that he was just in too much pain for anything.&nbsp; He took a hot shower, I put some Icy Hot on his back, and he laid down with the heating pad for about an hour before falling asleep.&nbsp; The Icy Hot and the heating pad were as hot as we got last night.&nbsp; lol&nbsp;

      “Now, aren’t you glad we came?” Keats handed Hannah a canteen of water; he smiled at her, that lopsided smile that made mirrors in his eyes of his feelings. It was the first thing she had noticed about him, the first thing she missed when she was away.She smiled at him, taking the canteen and leaning back against the tree. The sun on her outstretched legs and feet freshly bare from her hiking boots easing her mind. Keats took one foot into his lap massaging the toes and kissing the fat pad below them. “If I had known Mother Nature was going to treat me like this, I’d have looked her up a long time ago,” she smiled.Keats laughed, massaging the other foot, pulling it up to his lips and kissing her ankle. “Well she’s always been real good to me.” He was in his element. She watched him straighten himself to his full 5’10 height, stretch his arms over his head and turn towards the water of the stream. Hannah had not been camping since she was 18, that was seven years ago. Her life was spent busy in a suit at the office. Her new wilderness came with pantyhose, heels, and a cell phone. Keats….he had been a pleasant surprise. He was an EMT who spent the majority of his time outside. Hiking, biking, and especially rowing. Anything that would get him outside and using his hands. You could tell by the way his bronzed skin glowed and the ropy form of his muscles shaped by his passions. Following him along the mountain stream all day had been a task for Hannah. She was not the outdoors type. When he proposed the trip she had had to hit the army surplus for camping supplies and spend a month walking around her backyard in the bulky boots to break them in. She hadn’t wanted to go. Her idea of a weekend away involved satin sheets and room service. However, watching Keats stripping off his shirt standing thigh high in the stream made her forget room service. He was wringing water out of his shirt over his head making streams trickle off his back. The criss-crossing of muscles deflected the water to different places. You couldn’t do that at the Hilton, she mused. The sun was warm, the view was great, and Hannah fell asleep.She smelled smoke. When her eyes flew open, the sky was a pink haze of afternoon. Keats had a fire going near her napping roost at the tree. He had made camp as she dozed. She watched him shifting coals to make room for a mess kit pot. He was wearing his wrung out flannel shirt open showing the faint dust of gold chest hair. He was crouched on his heels watching the sun go down. Hannah sat up, “you’ve been busy.” She smiled at him and stretched her stiff muscles. Keats smiled at her; “I wanted everything to be perfect.”Hannah blushed. They had been together for six months. Almost inseparable, however they had never been intamate. Keats wanted to go slow and believed in taking time in this area. Hanna had been embarrassed when he expressed his desire to wait to her months ago. She had never been a fast girl, but her attraction to him had been so strong she’d have slept with him on the first date. The wait had been torture for her. She felt herself tingling just thinking about it.Keats' smile turned into a thoughtful stare. “You are beautiful when you sleep. I’ve been watching you.” His eyes were growing dark in the flames. Hannah smiled at him she moved to his side her long legs making her only a little shorter than him. “You should have woke me up, not let me be so lazy.”Keats reached out a hand to her cheek, stroking the lose strand of brown hair then placing it behind her ear. It was long hair when down, but she kept it up most of the time. He couldn’t wait to pull it down and hold his hands in the long waves. He had been waiting a long time. His thumb rubbed across her full lips, so soft and he looked down at the long lashes covering her blue eyes. He knew he couldn’t wait much longer. “Like I said,” his voice shook a little, he found himself nervous, “I wanted things perfect. You needed your rest.”She opened her mouth in a small sigh; he couldn’t take it anymore. He slipped his hand behind her neck and pulled her face to his. He kissed her slow and long putting all the emotions he had held so careful in check into the seduction of her lips. His tongue lapping at her lips and coaxing her mouth open and her tongue into his own mouth to play. Hannah slipped her hands around his neck. She held him to her pressing her body into his open shirt. She was so hungry for him. She had waited for him to be ready; pretending that it didn’t bother her that she was ready for this when her boyfriend was not. What is it when a woman is lustier than the man? Or perhaps, by the way his hands were pulling at her hair and moving down her back, perhaps he was just more patient. His hands slipped down to her hips, pulling her shirt out of her shorts, his thumbs stroking the skin at her sides below her ribs. He moaned in her mouth when the back of his hand touched her breasts kissing her harder. He placed his hands on her ass and pressed her hard against his hips. She could feel his arousal throbbing between them, she almost came undone at the first pulse beat on her thigh. “Hann…,” he managed to growl out, his hands holding her to him as he moved his hips against her. He kissed her jaw then her neck moving to her ear never letting go of her ass his fingers digging into the rounded flesh. “Hann, I can’t wait. If I don’t have you now I won’t be so gentle.”Hannah felt drugged by his hands and his mouth; she held onto him her mind hazy. She put her hands inside of his shirt and felt the warm skin. She grazed his nipples with her nails, leaning in to nip at the skin around his collarbone breathing in the scent of him. She felt his hands freeze, holding her still. “Hann please,” he grabbed her hands, he was breathing heavily, the muscle in his jaw twitching his eyes dark. “Don’t love I want to be perfect, gentle, and just for you.”Hannah met his eyes, she watched him for the longest moment, a breath hanging between the two. He wanted to be tender with her, but she had waited too long for tender. Taking a chance, she leaned in and sucked his bottom lip into her mouth, biting on the lush lip. She freed a hand and placed it against his arousal. She stroked him through his pants, “Who says perfect has to be gentle.”In the next blink, Hannah’s feet were off the ground. He carried her to the blanket under the tree. Fresh air hit her chest the same time her rear settled on the ground. Before her mind became oriented again, she was under him naked. His hands stroked everywhere, her sides her breasts, her thighs. He knelt between her open legs, bare-chested, exploring her. She reached up to undo his fly. She could read in his face his will power trying to slow himself down. Hannah sat up, undoing his pants and sliding her hands inside, “Keats, we have lots of time,” she whispered, her hand cupping his balls so full in her palm, the other stroking him getting an idea of his size. He was so wonderfully hard and longer than she had imagined. “Don’t hold back, I want you too much.”He leaned up, pushing his pants out of the way of her hands. His hands gripping her breasts firmly, their large size spilling around his fingers. They kissed, speaking with tongues and lips dancing together. One hand slid between her legs, he pressed two fingers against her shaved slit, wet juices meeting them immediately. She was wet and warm, maddening to his senses. He kissed her and pressed himself on top of her again. Holding his hand against the lips of her pussy, the other raising one of her legs high on his hips. Hannah stretched under him. His fingers were gliding over her slick clit making hot surges heat her stomach. It had been a long time since another had touched her there; the sensation was driving her wild. When his fingers slid into her waiting inside she almost cried with the sensation. Keats heard her and his excitement could no longer be held back. “Oh Hann,” he growled before he pulled her legs up high and slid himself in.There’s something about that first time when two becomes one. Hannah stopped breathing; the tingling was so intense and strong. She could feel every inch of him from her inside, every vein, every twitch the feeling so strong and good she choked on her own cry of passion. Her breath let go when she felt him thrust hard, all of him firmly in her waiting body.He held her there, his arms curling under her, holding her shoulders, his face pressed to the side of hers. He was waiting for her. She breathed against his ear, a low whimper blowing against his lobe as she used her muscles to grip him inside. Then he began. Long and slow strokes. Holding her shoulders to keep her firmly planted as he sped up their lovemaking. Each thrust driving her nearer to her edge. Making love with him made her understand the meaning of bittersweet. His size filling her to stretching. She felt like a virgin again, but virgins did not have the same desires as a woman who knows where the pleasure and pain can meet. She wrapped her legs high around his hips and rode him from underneath. Working together, their rhythm picked up to a hurried speed. Keats’ chest grazing her nipples into hard peeks, Hannah sucking on his chin to keep from screaming, her hands holding his back, stroking him there.He leaned in, taking one nipple in his mouth and sucking hard, his hand playing with the other. Her hands were in his hair holding him there, her body keeping up with the rhythm of their hips. His mouth traded places with his hand, his fingers sliding over her face. She took them in her mouth and simulated on them the feelings his cock was making in her inside. He leaned back as if a shock at went through him. His eyes cloudy and intense on her face. Hannah held his fingers in her mouth, lapping and sucking on the two; she could taste herself on their tips. He took her hands in his, jerking them over her head and holding them there with one hand. The feeling of being pinned and under his strength excited her more, as he began thrusting harder and faster. His face buried in her neck, biting at her shoulder, and her neck. She never dreamed he could be so hard and forceful. It aroused her completely. He bit her ear, his tongue inside the center swirl. “I want to cum inside you, Han,” he whispered hoarsely. The request, surprised her and excited her, she bucked her hips under him, wrapping her ankles together high above his back, “yes,” she said barely audible in her moaned breath. The intensity suddenly catching her. At the exact moment, the white heat in her belly exploded, the first coil taking her high, she jerked under him. “Yes!” she screamed, her head tilting back to the pleasure, “now, Keats, oh Keats!” He bit at her ear, holding the lobe and fucking her savagely. Her orgasm sending him over. When he felt her juices sliding out onto his balls, he burst inside. Thrusting into her so hard, her ass bounced off her thighs, he pounded her over and over until the last of him jerked inside of her. He collapsed beside her, drawing her immediately to his chest and clutching her there. He couldn’t catch his breath, she couldn’t stop shaking. The moment had been so intense and so much wilder than he had imagined for their first time. No words could be found to express the amazement of it all. They were alone in nature, and finally at one with each other. Keats kept thinking of her promise that they had all the time. He would go slow next time. He would make sure she was pleasured in every way. He hoped he had not hurt her.He looked over to her face. She was stroking his jaw and his temple with a shaky hand. Her eyes were deep with pleasure, her lips swollen from his kisses. In wonder and delight he realized, his gentle lover, didn’t seem to mind the not so gentle after all. She leaned in and bit his chin, then kissed the bite. He pulled her on top of him, her legs straddling his hips; he could feel himself become aroused again. How nice to know the woman he loved, loved for him to not hold anything in. The night was just beginning. Hannah moved down, taking his nipple in her hot mouth. They had a lot of time to catch up she mused as she felt him growing against her thigh. She slid back to let her wet slit grease him. A lot of time indeed. She could get used to this wild outdoors.

      *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*  I was rudely awoken this morning to an obnoxious beeping coming from just outside my bedroom door.&nbsp;   *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*  I knew what it was.&nbsp; The stupid smoke detector, whos battery was supposedly changed last week by Rick.&nbsp; Either an incredibly shitty battery or my husband's laziness interrupted my slumber.&nbsp; "Try to ignore it", I tell myself.&nbsp; "Think happy thoughts", as my sleepy eyes close, and I begin to think that perhaps...  *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*  "GODDAMNIT!"&nbsp; I throw back the sheets, looking at the baby monitor for signs of&nbsp;the baby&nbsp;being awake.&nbsp; If hes up, then I wouldn't have been able to get any more sleep anyway.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; I turn the volume up, expecting to hear him rustling around his room, but instead I hear baby snores.&nbsp; So I can't blame my lack of sleep on him.  *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*  Determined to go back to bed, I decide that if I simply remove the weak battery from the smoke detector, then the beeping will stop and I can go back to bed.&nbsp; Thats why its beeping isn't it?&nbsp; I can barely reach the stupid thing, and so I have no idea how it comes apart.&nbsp; My first thought is to just rip it from the wall.&nbsp; My second thought reminds me that its an electrical/battery combo, and that being electricuted probably sucks.&nbsp;   *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*  I notice a pin sticking out of the side and pull it out.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I decide to twist the casing.&nbsp; So far so good.&nbsp; I can see where I need to get into to get the battery out.&nbsp; I flip open the little door, and out pops the battery.&nbsp; Feeling rather proud of myself, I toss the battery on the dressor as I hop into bed, getting comfortable and ready for my reward nap.  *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*  You have got to be kidding me!&nbsp; I took the damn battery out!&nbsp; What the hell else does it want?!&nbsp; Throwing back the covers once again, I head to the source of my aggravation.&nbsp; "You stupid piece of shit," I spit at it, giving a venomous glare.&nbsp; I had no clue what to do, how to shut it up.&nbsp;   *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*  In my frustration, I suppose I tugged at it too hard, as it came out of the wall and into my hand.&nbsp; "Well," I say "At least now we'll have some peace and quiet."&nbsp; I set it down on the hall table and headed back to the bed room, satisfied that I could at least lie down and have a moment of silence before starting the day.&nbsp; Before I made it into the bed room, I heard it.  *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*  Its possesed!&nbsp; It must be!&nbsp; This smoke detector has an evil spirit residing in it!&nbsp; IT WON"T DIE!!!&nbsp;   *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*  I wrapped it up in a towel and hid it in the back of the closet for now.&nbsp; Perhaps Rick can perform an excorcism later tonight when he gets home.&nbsp; When its quiet enough, and the tv is off, you can still hear it, taunting me.&nbsp;   *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *BEEP*

      What is what GW said to Rick before rolling over and going to sleep?&nbsp;   Yes!&nbsp; You are correct!  Undeniably, there are times when you are expecting sex.&nbsp; You spend that extra five minutes in the shower, and another ten afterwards primping.&nbsp; You want it, you know spouse will take it, and that is what you expect.&nbsp; Being freshly shaven, I wanted Rick to eat me out last night.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anything afterwards would have simply been icing on the cake.&nbsp; Well, I had no cake last night.&nbsp; And not even a tiny lick of icing.&nbsp;   Rick kneaded my ass a bit, and walked his fingers around my lips.&nbsp; &nbsp; But then nothing.&nbsp; Frustrated, I got up and began passionatly kissing him, running my fingers through his hair.&nbsp; I let my hand wander down and cup his balls, before wrapping my fingers around his shaft.&nbsp; He was hard, but lay there, motionless on the bed, like a corpse.&nbsp; A limp warm corpse with a hard on.&nbsp; He was dead sexy! lol&nbsp; (fat bastard reference from Austin Powers movie, I couldn't resist)&nbsp; But seriously, I was really annoyed.&nbsp; I wanted him to act interested enough to at least move.&nbsp; I was tempted to direct him to my pussy anyway, to not let him get away with this lazy act of his.&nbsp; I even entertained the notion of sitting on his face, sucking on his cock while my pussy got the attention it yearned for.&nbsp; But alas, I was too annoyed, and chose not to reward his bad behavior.&nbsp; I wouldn't want this to become a habit of his.&nbsp; So I rolled over, pulling the covers over me and said, "You are so annoying."&nbsp; He pat my ass, as if he were humoring me, and moments later was snoring away as I lay there, horny and frustrated.&nbsp; Not mad.&nbsp; Well...Kinda mad.&nbsp; But not like fighting mad or anything.&nbsp; Just horny mad.&nbsp;

      Yesterday we had record setting cold, at a high of only 66 degrees.&nbsp; Add the rain and dampness, and it was downright chilly.&nbsp; Today, while absolutely gorgeous out, is still in the mid to lower sixties.&nbsp; The thought of wearing a bikini in this cool weather gives me goose bumps.&nbsp; (the chilly kind, not the good ones! ;0)&nbsp; )&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Odd, when you think that our normal temps are about 30-40 degrees warmer.&nbsp; I'm not griping, just wish I was working on my tan.&nbsp;

      can leave much to be desired.&nbsp; Maybe it was my fault for sucking his dick before we started.&nbsp; Bad wifey!&nbsp; ;0)&nbsp; But it most certainly was a quick romp this morning!&nbsp; After exploding on my tummy, and slapping my mound with his drained shaft, Rick threw on his clothes, heading down the hall to get the boy.&nbsp; I had already decided I wanted an orgasm, or two, or three....&nbsp; So I was quick to dive into my nightstand grabbing the trusty vibrator.&nbsp; It didn't take long before the first climax rolled in.&nbsp; My heart beat sped up as I decided I needed more.&nbsp; A moment to recover and then...mmmmm....Yes.&nbsp; The second one was even easier than the first.&nbsp; Surely I could grind out a third.&nbsp; But would I have time?&nbsp; I wanted this orgasm and I was determined to have it.&nbsp; I knew it wouldn't take much effort.&nbsp; A few seconds pass, and I'm curling up my toes,&nbsp; submitting to the pleasure.&nbsp; Mmmm...&nbsp; And not a moment too soon.&nbsp; I just had enough time to throw the vibe into the drawer before I heard little footsteps pounding towards my door calling out, "Mommy!"&nbsp;

      You know, some days, you really should just stay in bed.&nbsp; Today would have been one of those days.&nbsp; The first thing my sleepy little foot touched this morning, when getting out of bed, was a gigantic fresh hairball, provided by our ever accomodating cat.&nbsp; After cleaning the warm goo from between my toes, EWWW, I head down the hallway to free the little moster that is my son.&nbsp; Apparently, daddy didn't put pants on him last night after his bath, only a shirt and diaper.&nbsp; Having free access to the diaper tabs, he found it necessary to take off his diaper, which coincidently had a rather large turd in it.&nbsp; Well, that turd must have been the best toy he had in that room, because he was quick to run up to me and show me his new play thing.&nbsp; Again, EWW!!&nbsp; So off to the bath.&nbsp; After bath time, we head to the kitchen, where I'm guessing someone (Rick) left the freezer open which in turn melted the ice cream which at some point leaked all over the freezer and then onto the floor.&nbsp; Luckily, the dog was&nbsp;up to the challenge and had decided to lick it all up.&nbsp; Unluckily, I think the dog may be lactose intolerant, as he also puked&nbsp; up the ice cream, along with some not very well chewed dog chow.&nbsp; Then upon taking himout to do his business, he had diarrhea on the back steps.&nbsp; Say it with me.&nbsp; EWWWW!!!&nbsp; I think I'll take the rest of the day off now.&nbsp; Who wants to cover for me?&nbsp; Anyone?&nbsp; Anyone?

      I was really horny last night.&nbsp; Big surprise, right? lol&nbsp; Just the scent of Rick drove me wild and made me wet.&nbsp; It was ridiculous.&nbsp; When we finally went to bed, I snuggled up close to him, trying to gauge his possible interest.&nbsp; When I felt a nudge on my leg, I dove in for the kill.&nbsp; Pulling his boxers down, I grabbed hold of him, feeling his shaft come to life in my hand.&nbsp; A few kisses and flicks of the tongue, and he was ready to play too.&nbsp; I could feel the wetness between my legs, and I was tingling with the anticipation of feeling him inside of me.&nbsp; Rick moved to the middle of the bed, obviously already knowing my next move.&nbsp; I quickly climbed on top of him, impaling myself with his hard cock, both of us letting out a moan of pleasure.&nbsp; Unbuttoning my nightgown, Rick began kneading and squeezing my breasts,&nbsp; pulling me closer to him so his mouth could reach me.&nbsp; His tongue flicked my already erect nipples as I bounced up and down, grinding myself on his dick.&nbsp; "Bite me", I instruct him, as he begins to gently tease my nipples with his teeth.&nbsp; I don't know why I like that, but it seems inevitable for me to have him bite me when I'm on top.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it feels good, do it, right?&nbsp; I then sit up straight, anchoring myself with my hands on his chest, moving faster, squeezing my cunt around his cock.&nbsp; He watches my tits bounce and grunts his satisfaction, getting closer to coming.&nbsp; His hands find my hips.&nbsp; I know hes about to come, and decide to take it like the porn star I could have been.&nbsp; His fingers tighten on my hip bones, mouth curling, before pulling me off of him.&nbsp; My mouth quickly finds his dick,&nbsp; milking every last drop directly from the source, tasting my own juices mixed with his.&nbsp; "Oh fuck!", he says.&nbsp; When hes done spasming, I smile, wiping a tiny drop from the corner of my mouth before kissing him.&nbsp; "Good night, baby," I say.&nbsp; He mumbled something that was probably along the lines of "good night" as well.&nbsp; I told you I was horny!

      “Can I help you?” it was hot in the kitchen. She had been cooking all morning, both ovens going, the dishwasher hissing steam, and the doors had been swung open so much to the back porch that the ac didn't have a chance of hitting a cool lick. He was standing there arm braced on the door, holding open the screen that same frown on his face as two days ago. Perry didn’t feel like soothing words today. She was tired, her sundress was sticking to her back and chest with sweat, she had flour up to her elbows and she suspected hanging in her hair. She whacked the large ball of dough with her fist as she stared at him her green eyes flicked with tension. He was so damn stubborn. He’d been mad for two days, but wouldn’t tell her what was going on in his head. She had come out to the ranch to help him out. His cook had been sick. He had a big rodeo coming up and there was an odd dozen cowboys making camp around the ranch in preparation. They all wanted to stay here for the good cooking and the feel of the old west that still lingered on the Texas hacienda. She thought she was doing him a favor. She had wanted to spend some time with him before he left for the season again. Loving a cowboy was not an easy job. There had been an impromptu dance the night she arrived. He had spent the night in a cooler of beer and talking with his friends. She had spent the evening on the porch watching, after trying to make conversation with the only two other females had proved unlikely. Not riding herself, and definitely not a rodeo groupie, there was little to talk about, and some of their stories had made her embarrassed to just listen. The only person that had seemed to notice she was even there was Jim’s brother Ted. He had chatted with her most of the night, rocking in the swing together and at one point, swooping her up to dance to a song on the radio. Sweat was running at her temple pulling at her red hair, making it curl and fall out of the chopsticks holding the long mass in place off her neck. She could feel a pool between her large breasts as well. It was damn hot, and sticky. It was too damn hot to have Jim still glaring at her after two days of silence and the cold treatment. She unbuttoned the two top buttons of her dress letting air hit the tops of her breasts. Flour smeared across her chest then wiped off onto the dress across where her breasts pulled tight the third button. “What Jim!” her temper finally heated to its point. “Ted likes you,” his voice was flat his expression never changed, “says you’re a nice girl.” Perry arched a brow at him and gaped her mouth. What Jim lacked in expression she made up for in open disbelief. She closed her mouth with an audible pop of her full lips closing together, “you don’t speak to me in two days, you’re going around looking like the world pissed in your bathwater and that’s what you got to say to me? Ted says I’m a nice girl?”Silence, tension, not a word. The ovens beeped at their preheated temperature, the screen door at the front of the house slammed shut. The last of the cowboys heading to the barn for the bull riding practice, his boots clopped down the stairs and he was gone. Perry took a breath. “Well,” she changed her stance to a relaxed one, ignoring the increasing anger from the dark, brooding man in the doorway. “I think your brother is a very nice guy too.” She began working the dough again with her fists. His cowboy hat was pulled down to his nose. She could see his full bottom lip and his firm thin upper. His tanned jaw twitched every few seconds like it did when he was annoyed. He was wearing his flannel shirt with the sleeves cut out, it was unbuttoned and pulled out of his jeans. He was covered in dirt from working outside. She watched him from the corner of her eye pretending to not care her was there. The truth being, he was making it hotter in the room just by being there.He took his hat off and hung it on the rack by the back door. His black hair was spiked and disheveled from being under the hat. His gray eyes now looked openly at her, he began walking towards the table in the middle of the kitchen Perry was working at. “You two looked real cosey the other night, real friendly like on my swing.” Perry pretended to not notice he was closer to her. In fact he was rounding the table in slow steady strides. “He kept me company while you were entertaining your friends.” These were going to be the most well packed rolls of her life. She could feel him behind her. His warmth hitting her back, “real cosey, he’s been talking about it all week” he was close to her ear. She thought she felt his hand touch her hair. “I would think you would be glad that we two get along,” she spun around, one hand still bedded in the dough bowl. His jaw was still twitching. He was frowning so hard he looked like a kettle about to explode. She locked eyes with him. Determination. There was some hard determination in those gray eyes. She caught her breath.He was steadily coming towards her. Her backside pressed against the table, his thigh pushing into hers. She leaned back into the bowl to keep from falling over. “You would think that, would you?” He was looking at her dress now. His eyes moving up and down over her face, the open buttons, the short skirt, the bare feet. “Well I wouldn’t mind but he liked it a little too much.”He planted a hand on the table, pinning her between him and the rough edge. “You didn’t seem to mind him too much yourself.” He curled a hair around his finger and pulled it back straight from her curls. “He always did want what was mine.”Perry straightened up and glared at him. “Yours? I am not one of your horses, Jim Rein….” His hands went into her hair pulling her in and kissing her. It was sudden and the hottest intense kiss she had ever felt. All the jealousy and pent up hostility was pouring into her mouth when his tongue pushed inside. All the anger and visions of his brother and Perry together pouring out into one long possessive kiss.Perry was so mad at his stupid jealousy she couldn’t think. Then his hands jerked her hair free and twisted her neck to open her mouth wider and she forgot being mad. She only remembered how much she had wanted him in the last few days and couldn’t have him. His hand reached for her breasts, palm squeezing and kneading the large mound firmly. His fingers moving to undo the next buttons while his other held her head to his mouth. Perry shifted under him, moving her legs around trying to stay standing when he pressed his hips into hers. Her bare feet grazing his cowboy boots. She slid her tongue into his mouth, letting him have as much as he was giving her. All her anger at his stubborn coldness letting go. He picked her up. She didn’t notice until she felt the cool counter on her ass cheeks. Her dress was worked up around her waist, and stripped off her breasts from the top. His body pressing her legs open in the corner of the counter where she had been placed. She stripped his shirt off, and was holding onto his belt buckle when he removed her bra and immediately began sucking her right nipple. This wasn’t slow lovemaking. This was pent up tension, coming to a boil. He was being rough and possessive. She couldn’t have stood it if he had been any different. She needed him too much to be gentle. Perry pulled the belt free, undid his tight jeans and reached inside. Her hand just touched the hard long familiar when he grabbed her hands and pinned them high above her head to the cabinet door. He locked eyes with her as his other hand moved to slide directly to her pussy. The touch of the rough fingers against her lower lips made her wet instantly. She had been wanting him, needing him too much. Two fingers went inside her steadily curling once deep inside, his thumb rubbing her clit in a slow circle. He watched her face. She locked eyes with him her legs opening wider, her feet finding grips on the handles of the drawers on the counter. His jeans rubbing her thighs. Her ass shifting to let his fingers in deeper, hips arching from the counter. Both of them were fighting for breath. Tension thick, dead silence in the air minus their ragged breaths. Suddenly, his face melted. His lips turned soft, his eyes liquid blue when he buried his face into her neck and drove in home. She let out a loud gush of air when he buried himself completely into her on first stroke. She didn’t have time to take another deep breath before he was moving in and out fast. Still pinning her hands high to the counter, his thumb pressed down on her clit as he fucked her harder than he had ever before.His lips sucked in her ear lobe, grazing the skin with his teeth, his stubbled jaw making her neck tingle. His thumb making her surge with pleasure everytime he thrust inside. She caught her breath again, letting it out in a moan. He bit her shoulder then, moving his hands both to her breasts and kneading them, pulling at her nipples with his rough fingers. Perry wrapped her legs around his hips; her arms around his neck, letting her nails pull at the skin of his neck. He took his hands and scooped them under her ass, lifting her off the counter to tilt onto his hard cock. She clung to him, ankles locked behind his back, her back on the counter. He drove in deeper hard strokes pushing her back into the counter at an odd angle. His hands on her ass slamming her into him hips she could feel his balls slapping her ass. All the long hot afternoons, tense stares, uncomfortable silences where coming to a head. They were fucking and fighting at the same time, trying to break the tension that was too thick. Both giving as much as the other got. Perry clinging with nails in his shoulder blades, biting at his lip and chin. Jim fully possessing her by fucking her as hard as he could, needing to feel branded inside of her skin. Too much tension and too intense pleasure can’t last forever. Time stood still for a few moments until Perry felt the long coil of pleasure begin to roll in her belly. She pressed her legs higher on her lover, moaning against his lips. Jim stopped, and placed her back on the counter. Holding her waist and taking long slow strokes. He took her mouth with his and rubbed his thumb over her aching clit. Perry exploded in his arms. Each loud scream, caught in her throat and was pulled onto the tongue of her lover. His hands curled around her shoulders and he began to thrust harder, jerking her almost off the counter. His own release soon coming, he felt her wetness slip between them and his own came too. Now it was Perry’s turn to kiss his sounds away before the wondering cowboys came in to inspect the kitchen. He ground out a low grunt each thrust he made until the last of him was spent. They stayed locked to each other for a long moment. Sweat making their bodies slick against each other and sticky at the same time. Both trying to catch their breath. Jim’s head buried in her shoulder, his arms holding her to him. With a sigh, he pulled her dress back over her shoulders and stepped back from her. His face relaxed, and tender. He placed a palm to her cheek and stroked her swollen lip; he could already see a swelling on her neck. He had left a love bruise on her like a teenaged fool. She slid down from the counter, her legs shaky. He held her up his hands on her ass under her skirt kneading the flesh against his hips. Her eyes searched his face. He smiled so did she. She leaned into his chest, her forehead resting on his chin. “I’m glad you worked that out of your system,” she kissed the skin at his throat. He kissed her forehead and hugged her to him, “me too,” his voice was relaxed. “I get a little jealous sometimes.”Perry stroked his back, “Jim you know where my heart always is”He grunted. “But this don’t mean you own me,” she mumbled into his neck.“I know,” he slid his hand back to her wet pussy, his fingers easily sliding along the lips until she tensed again, “but it’s a good down payment I’d say.”“We’ll see about that,” Perry moved away from him and put the counter between them. “I’m going to go get cleaned up.” She headed up the stairs then turned. “This down payment?”Jim smiled at her, crossing his hands over his chest after zipping his pants. “Hmm mmm?” “Think your brother would make me a similar offer?” she took the stairs two at a time to get ahead of him. She made it to the bathroom door before he caught her up around the waist bolting the bathroom door before pulling her in the shower.

      This morning, someone got to my site by doing a Yahoo search for 'foods that makes cum taste good'.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being the helpful person that I am, I will answer that question, should he/she find themselves here again.&nbsp; That food does not exist.&nbsp; You can eat all fruit all the time for years on end.&nbsp; Not gonna work.&nbsp; Might cut down on the acrid after taste a bit, but no, poor misguided soul, you can not produce 'good tasting' come.&nbsp;   Also, more search queries for sperm juice recipes, this time hot sperm juice included.&nbsp; I feel special.&nbsp; lol&nbsp;

      Don't be shy about your sex toys.&nbsp; Try rubbing your vibrator along my legs and on my testicles. &nbsp; Take your panties off, throw them in the freezer, then caress my bod with them.&nbsp; Don't laugh.&nbsp; It's actually awesome. &nbsp; &nbsp; Blindfold me with a bra.&nbsp; It forces me to pay attention to how incredible you feel. &nbsp; &nbsp; In a cab, climb onto my lap (facing me), then stick your left leg over my shoulder and your right leg out the window.&nbsp; It's a little awkward, but it feels so good, we won't care. &nbsp; &nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I want to know who the guys are that contributed these tips.&nbsp; And most importantly, just how drunk were they?&nbsp; Throw frozen panties at your fella?&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; And then wrap your bra around their head as you lead them to a cab to perform arobatics with your leg hanging out the window of a moving vehicle.&nbsp; Whatever happened to keeping all hands feet and objects inside the vehicle at all times?&nbsp; And further more, who gets turned on by this?&nbsp; Anyone brave enough to admit to enjoying a thongcicle?&nbsp; I thought not.

      Watch your mouth. You'll be hating your job this month. Don't complain, though, or you'll risk a reprimand. Single? Body insecurity invades your psyche near the 20th. Enroll in a yoga class to gain confidence. Attached? On the 22nd, your erotic ingenuity will keep you both inspired...past 4am. Cosmic tip: You feel extrasexy on the 28th, so get your butt out on the social scene. &nbsp; So if I complain about my job, Rick will reprimand me?&nbsp; Hmmm...&nbsp; Perhaps a spanking will be in order!&nbsp; Watch my mouth?&nbsp; What will come of my mouth?&nbsp; Or is that a part of my punishment?&nbsp; I believe I feel a reprimand coming on! lol&nbsp; And my cosmic tip says I'll feel extrasexy on the 28th.&nbsp; Well good, cuz thats my anniversary and I've got the lingerie bill to prove it!&nbsp; Gawd, horoscopes are stupid!         &nbsp;

      While Rick was on the computer last night, I spent the evening soaking in a hot tub and then the tedious task of shaving.&nbsp; The hot bath really helped in softening the hair though, so it was a quick job for once.&nbsp; I was putting on lotion when Rick came in the bedroom to get something.&nbsp; "You smell good," he says, stopping over to kiss me before leaving again.&nbsp; I had decided to be good tonight, not pouncing on Rick or ripping off his pants sucking his dick and then begging him to fuck me.&nbsp; I had been overly agressive lately, in my opinion, and I decided I needed to let him come to me.&nbsp; If he didn't take the bait, fine.&nbsp; No problem.&nbsp; But I was going to be good.&nbsp;  &nbsp; It seemed like ages before Rick finally came back to the bedroom.&nbsp; When he did, he stripped in front of me before jumping into the shower.&nbsp; I resisted the urge to jump up and kiss his skin, to feel his body up against mine, to join him in the shower.&nbsp; "Lets be practical,"I tell myself, "I just got out of the tub.&nbsp; It would be a waste of perfectly good lotion to jump in that shower with him."&nbsp;  *Deep breath in* &nbsp; "I can be good."&nbsp;  &nbsp; While waiting for Rick to come out of the steamy bathroom, I tried to find a non-come-hither pose on the bed.&nbsp; He must have been in there quite awhile, as I found myself readjusting often.&nbsp; Finally he exits, smelling freshly of soap and cologne.&nbsp;  *Deep breath in* &nbsp; I can be good. &nbsp; We watched television for a bit and then it was lights out.&nbsp; I was tempted to rub up against him, in case he had forgotten I was there, but resisted.&nbsp; Moments pass.&nbsp; I start to think, "Aha!&nbsp; I have been quite the little nympho lately, just as I thought.&nbsp; I've bored my husband of sex!&nbsp; What a terrible wife I am."&nbsp; My thoughts were interupted by Rick asking if I was thirsty before getting up for some ice water.&nbsp; "I'll have a drink of yours," I say, a bit disappointed.&nbsp; Doesn't he know I just shaved?&nbsp; Can't he smell my lotion?&nbsp; Aren't I sexy anymore?&nbsp; My thoughts were again interupted as he returned with the glass of ice water, offering me a sip.&nbsp; I accept and then lay back, convinced the night is over.&nbsp; But it wasn't. &nbsp; Taking a large drink of the icy cold liquid, Rick set the cup down on the night table before ripping my legs apart, resting his head between them and kissing the freshly smooth skin with his mouth.&nbsp; The coldness surprised me, but it was magnificent in contrast to my heat.&nbsp; I closed my eyes and let out a moan.&nbsp; "I was good," I purr.&nbsp; Rick dives his cold tongue deeper into my snatch, stealing my breath.&nbsp; I graze my fingers over the fabric&nbsp;covering my nipples and let my hand wander down to his mouth.&nbsp; He sucks on my fingers before I begin rubbing myself, his mouth following, wetting a path for my fingertips to find.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Placing his hands underneath my ass, Rick lifts me higher and deeper into his mouth, tongue thrashing around my clit, grazing my fingers in the frenzy.&nbsp; My breaths shorten as my pussy tenses, getting ready to release.&nbsp; He senses this and rubs a finger around my labia, wetting it with my juices and his kisses, then plunging it deep inside, his tongue following as deeply as possible.&nbsp; I expolde into climax, massaging his finger and tongue with my orgasm, feeling weak from such a huge release.&nbsp; In my mind I say, "Fuck me!&nbsp; Shove your dick in my pussy!"&nbsp; But I refrain.&nbsp; I can be good.&nbsp;  &nbsp; As if reading my mind, Rick gets up on his knees, running a finger through my cunt juices and wettens the tip of his dick.&nbsp; Grabbing my legs from behind my knees, he opens me up as he gets his body into position.&nbsp; He trusts his hard cock into me, taking my breath away as he just stays there, not moving.&nbsp; I squeeze myself around him, trying to coax him to pound me, then remember I was trying to be good, and stop.&nbsp; I see a smile cross his face.&nbsp; "Do you want me to fuck you, babydoll?"&nbsp; Oh, how delicious it is, hearing him talk like that!&nbsp; "Yes," I obediantly answer him.&nbsp; "What?&nbsp; I can't hear you.&nbsp; What did you want me to do?"&nbsp; "I want you to fuck me."&nbsp; Hes being naughty!&nbsp; I love it!&nbsp; "Oh.&nbsp; You want me to fuck you?"&nbsp; "Yes, baby.&nbsp; I want you to fuck my pussy with your big hard dick."&nbsp; He slowly pulls himself out and then even more slowly re-enters.&nbsp; "Like this?"&nbsp; I moan in the pleasure of the agony in waiting.&nbsp; "Or did you mean like this?", he asks as he begins thrusting in and out of my pussy with quick, hard movements.&nbsp; "Ohhhh fffuuuck!," I mumble.&nbsp; He stops.&nbsp; "Which did you want me to do, babydoll?"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm so wet, I can feel the moistness dripping down to my ass.&nbsp; "Fuck me Rick!&nbsp; Please fuck me!"&nbsp; At this, he begins to pound me,&nbsp;balls slapping my ass with each movement.&nbsp; "Oh yeah!&nbsp; Fuck me!&nbsp; Fuck my pussy!&nbsp; Your dick is so hard, it feels so fucking good, Rick!"&nbsp; He can't take much dirty talk, it very quickly throws him over the edge, but I was so&nbsp;into it, I couldn't help it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw his face twist up, and knew he was close.&nbsp; A few more hard thrusts, before he pulled out, exploding on my tummy, and embracing me as he collapsed.&nbsp; I knew I could be good! ;0)&nbsp;

       "These are a few of my favorite things..." &nbsp; Not really.&nbsp; They are, however, searches performed on Google, Yahoo, and MSN search engines that brought people to my sight.&nbsp;  Wha-wha-what?! &nbsp; While I do indeed love my dog, I can assure you that I was never attracted to him.&nbsp;  EVER. &nbsp; My siblings are both at awkward ages where I wouldn't be interested in them for at least a few more years, and that sperm juice recipe?&nbsp;  *gagging* &nbsp; Okay, no joke there, thats just gross.&nbsp; I don't think I've ever used that word on this site before.&nbsp; You people are sickos!&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; Yuck.

       urlLink    Off to the showers!  We've just had a family outing to a local school track, where I ran a 7:30 mile.  Mind you, thats with pushing a 35 pound toddler in a jogging stroller as well.  Poor asthmatic Rick made the mile in about 13 minutes.  Perhaps a shared shower will raise his spirits!  It will mine! ;0)  &nbsp; urlLink

      I have a confession though.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; And an odd one at that.&nbsp; In his story, he describes a night stand, drawer filled with copies of Reader's Digest strategically hiding a large blue dildo.&nbsp; I stopped upon reading that, puzzled.&nbsp; I re-read the line, and then the next few before stopping, genuinely perplexed.&nbsp; That night stand is in my bedroom, magazines and dildo included.&nbsp; &nbsp; Rick bought it for me, under unbelievably similar circumstances even down to saying nearly the exact same words.&nbsp; Try to understand the eerie feeling of someone so closely, without any intention, describing a tid bit of your life.&nbsp; Its an odd sensation.&nbsp; The story is excellent, as I knew his writing would be.&nbsp; I may, however, begin searching for the cameras, should he pin point me so closely again! lol

      As earlier noted, Rick and I quickly made up, if you can even call it that, as we weren't really even fighting.&nbsp; He was especially loving and cuddly, which was nice, since he had been lax in that department thanks to his new past time.&nbsp; I was lying on my tummy, watching tv in bed, when he came into the bedroom and undressed before getting into bed.&nbsp; He rested his hand on my calf at first, and then began massaging my leg moving his fingers higher and higher, before resting again on the back of my thigh.&nbsp; I knew where this was going, but lay there watching the television, anticipating his next movement.&nbsp; He adjusted himself closer to me, kissing my leg as he slipped his fingers up my night shirt, squeezing my ass and nibbling my toes.&nbsp; I am horrendously ticklish, so I burst out in laughter as he kissed my feet.&nbsp; He instantly stopped the laughter by entering my pussy with his finger, probing around and thrusting it in and out.&nbsp; I gasped at the surprise and then enjoyed the moment, letting out a moan of pleasure.&nbsp; He stopped, and again licked my toes.&nbsp; This time I just couldn't take it, and fought to tear my foot away from him and rolling over so I could keep an eye on him.&nbsp; "What?", he smiled.&nbsp; In my new position, I could see how hard he was, and couldn't resist grabbing him, stroking his cock a few times.&nbsp; To this, Rick adjusted himself closer still to me, as his left arm went under my leg, his fingers parting my lips as he began probing me again.&nbsp; Getting on his side, his right arm rested on my hip, his wrist hitting just the right spot when he began to stimulate my clit, his other hand still inside me.&nbsp; I quickly held his wrist in place, so as not to lose the wonderful feeling.&nbsp; He caught on immediatly and began moving his hands more feverishly, all the while having his dick stroked by my hand, matching his speed.&nbsp; I could feel an orgasm quickly approaching, and pushed his wrist against me even harder as my body gave in to the familiar waves, Ricks fingers still in my pussy, feeling the muscles grip him.&nbsp; I know how much he loves that.&nbsp; Just as it was subsiding, he quickly rubbed me into a second and even a third climax.&nbsp; Finally I couldn't take it anymore and had to push him away.&nbsp; After catching my breath, I kissed him, as he sat up on the bed.&nbsp; I positioned myself between his legs and began slowly kissing his cock, making small circles around the head at first, and then taking the whole length into my mouth.&nbsp; His groans of approval, getting me that much more into it.&nbsp; I let my kisses completely wet him before I took my hand and began pumping him in coordination with my mouths movements.&nbsp; This drives him over the edge very quickly.&nbsp; He was so deep in my mouth, that I actually didn't even taste it when he came.&nbsp; I only knew it by the spasms of his shaft and the sudden urge in the back of my throat to swallow.&nbsp;&nbsp; His body shuddered as he collapsed onto the bed, me lying next to him.&nbsp; I smiled, happy that he chose me tonight.&nbsp;

      Especially in a grocery store when she has a two year old sitting in the cart, wedding ring on her hand and is talking to a friend about her mother's recent surgery.&nbsp; Is it an accepted intro for conversation now?&nbsp; I missed that memo.&nbsp; Didn't help that the guy made a squeezing motion with his hands towards my chest, as if to ask permission to feel for himself.&nbsp; The mommy in me wanted to smack his hand and say, "No!&nbsp; Shame on you!", but I opted for the look of disgust, met by his clueless "WhatdidIdo?" expression as he walked away.&nbsp;&nbsp; And why is it assumed that everyone with ample bosom is falsely enhanced?&nbsp; I'm not the first woman on earth to be naturally buxom.&nbsp; Or am I?

      I'm laying out in the sun today, wearing my new bikini that I just adore, listening to an old Gin Blossom's cd when I hear our dog start barking like crazy.&nbsp; I wasn't alarmed in any way, as he barks like that if the wind changes direction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I tone him out and start getting irritated five minutes later when hes still barking.&nbsp; Just as I am about to get up, I hear, "*ahem* Mrs. Wife?"&nbsp; Looking up I see its the mail man holding a package at the entrance to our gate.&nbsp; Hes in his mid thirties I'd say, and always quick to flirt.&nbsp; I didn't have a towel or anything to try and cover up with as I walked over to him, so I felt a bit odd, imagining what my mother would say if she saw the situation.&nbsp; Something about being indecent, I'm sure.&nbsp; As I'm nearing the gate, I notice him smiling at me,&nbsp; and scanning my body up and down as I approach.&nbsp; I managed a polite smile, and when I took the package from him, he made a point of reaching down and adjusting his hard on right there in front of me, in those stylish postal carrier shorts of his.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wondered how long he had actually been standing there watching me, since the dog had been going nuts for quite awhile.&nbsp; While, I was....flattered at his response, I couldn't help but laugh at what might have been his attempt at a pick up line.&nbsp; Or gesture, I suppose I should say! lol&nbsp; I shall keep a towel handy from now on, though I'm not sure that would have stopped the hopless romantic that is our mail carrier.

      When Rick came home, I led him into the kitchen where I had the Clorox Oxy Clean something or other cleaner sitting on the counter with a bowl and a scrub brush.  "I need you to make up some of this cleaning solution," I say.  "What do you need me to clean?  The swing?" (referring to the outside swing which has some dirt spots on it)  "That and something else too."  He mixes the solution and then asks, "Okay, where do you need me?"  He follows me into the bedroom.  "What is it?  Hairball from the cat?"  I pick up the pillow, handing it to him.  "What do you suppose that is?," I ask him, laughing in my head at the look of shock on his face that quickly disappears.  "I have no idea."  "Huh.  Thats funny.  I spent the whole morning looking for that pillow when I was making the bed and couldn't find it.  I finally found it this afternoon, shoved under the bed."  He pretends to examine it, as if he has no clue as to what it may be.  "Thats weird" he says.  "Whats really gross, is that that is the pillow I lay my face on when I watch television in the bedroom."  No comment, as he scrubs the fabric.  "Well whatever it was," he says "it came off really easily."  "Lets just make sure this doesn't ever happen again.  And please try to remember that the Kleenex here in the bedroom is just as good as the Kleenex in the office."  Silence.  He knows.  He knows I know.  I know he knows I know.  Is this the end of the saucy affair?  I doubt it.  But at least I didn't clean it up this time.

      After spending a good part of the morning tearing apart our bedroom, searching for a missing pillow, said pillow has suddenly been found-shoved under the bed.  But, horrors!!  Someone has molested the poor thing, its pretty dry clean only material show evidence of the brutal attack that occured.  My poor, defenseless pillow was the victim of a sensless crime, and it happened under my very nose.  I deduct that it happened while I was in the shower last night, just after discovering the mess in the office.  This affair my husband is having with his hand is more serious than I thought, if hes coming mulitple times in such a short while.    I fear I am at the beginning of a sexless stretch for an unknown amount of time.  No worries though, as I have plenty batteries stored away, and can always reminensce about romps of days past.  As for my pillow.  I hope she will be okay.  A traumatic thing has happened to her.  I only hope she doesn't let it ruin her life.  I can tell you this though, I will not be the one seeking an answer to her battle wounds.  I plan on giving that job to Rick, just as soon as he walks in the door.  Should be interesting.  xoxo

      Ya know, the nineties really weren't long enough ago to warrant so many specials about them.  I noticed both VH1 and E! had shows about the nineties on last night.  Its funny.  Seeing Jay and Silent Bob on I Love The 90's last night is what reminded me of Jason.  Jay, Jason.  Funny.  Jay and Silent Bob crack me up.  And Jason....  They talked about Mortal Kombat on ILT90's last night, which made me remember the first time I saw the game in the arcade at the local skating rink.  The guys were just pumping quarters into the machine, and we were all amazed at the amount of blood spewing from the characters heads.  Surely they would have been drained of all their blood supply after that blow!  Years later, my younger brother had the game for...Playstation?  And he quickly learned how to do all the fatalites, calling us in the living room to see him execute the grotesque, yet captivating final moves.  We are a sick people. lol  And they also talked about Quantum Leap.  My goodness, how I loved that show.  And Scott Bakula!  Yum!  He was smart, but sweet, and hot in that older man kind of way.  I have to say, the premise of that show was just brilliant.  "...to put right, what once went wrong."    Its weird seeing all these things from your childhood/teenage years and have them talk about it like it was so long ago.  Tends to make you feel old.  lol

      I had a crush on Rick for a very long time before we ever started dating, so I was quick to accept the invitation to his house for a party.  His parents were out of town, and alot of our friends from work were going to be there.  I saw this as an opportunity to get closer to Rick, and hopefully to find out he liked me as well.    There was lots of alcohol floating around that party.  Rick's friend Jason was freshly 21 and able to buy whatever we wanted.  Jason was a quiet almost mysterious guy with very long, pretty hair, past his shoulder blades.  (nowadays its butt length and just as gorgeous.)  He didn't know most of our friends, so he spent most of the evening up in Rick's bedroom playing on his computer.    After a few drinks, someone suggested spin the bottle.  I made sure to get Rick in the circle, and was hoping to get a peck or two from him.  He was so drunk though, that he laid down and fell asleep.  Instead I shared most of my kisses with my girlfriend, as my spin always landed on her.  I think I may have kissed two other guys, but I didn't care.  It wasn't Rick, so it didn't matter.    Rick was awake long enough to go sit out in the front yard, where of course I followed him, like a little puppy dog.  No intelligent conversation could be had, as he was a drunken slurring mess, looking less attractive all the time.  A friend of ours, not out of the closet at the time, but out and flaming now, came over and got Rick down to his underwear as he lay unconscious in the grass.  He even went so far as to look inside his briefs, giggling like a school girl.  We always did wonder about him...  I got frustrated sitting outside with Rick's lifeless body, and went inside the house.  Most everyone was equally drunk and less than entertaining to be around.  I headed upstairs where I planned to sleep off the night in Rick's bed, eager for the fruitless night to be over.  Jason was still in there, playing on the computer.  "Are you stupid drunk too?" I asked, as I sat on the edge of the bed closest to him.  "No," he laughed,"I've only had this one drink all night" as he pointed to a half full glass of an unknown drink.  I myself was somewhat buzzed, but certainly not drunk.  Mostly I was frustrated that the evening hadn't gone better for me.    We talked for awhile, and he finished his drink as I played with his hair.  "Your hair is so pretty, I just can't stop running my fingers through it."  The comment was innocent as could be, his hair truly was a silken pleasure to the touch.  "Is that right?  Well you can play with it as much as you want."  I suddenly realized that he was flirting with me, and while shocked at first, I was quick to warm up to the idea.    Still in the office chair, he rolled even closer to the bed, where I was sitting on the corner of the bed.  He positioned the chair between my legs, spreading them slightly with the edges of the seat.  He bowed his head before me, his hair cascading down his shoulders and covering his face.  I massaged my fingers on his scalp, hearing an approving moan come from beneath the sea of hair.  I could feel the heat of his breath hitting my inner thighs as he exhaled.  My body tingled at the excitement of the moment.  I had never considered Jason as a potential boyfriend.  He was just Rick's friend.  And yet...  I pulled his head close to my body, stopping just short of my chest and kissed the top of his head.  He looked up at me and smiled, bringing his lips closer to mine and then pausing, waiting to see if I would take the bait.  Moving in what felt like slow motion, my lips met his.  Licking his bottom lip, I gently probed his mouth with my tongue.  I felt his hands wrap around me, resting on my back before pulling my entire body closer to him.  His hands tracing large patterns on my back before grasping the bottom of my shirt, pulling it off and then kissing my neck.  His hair brushing against my breasts and tummy sent shivers throughout my body and an electric charge down to my pussy.  I could feel myself getting wetter and wetter as he sat up, quickly ripping off his shirt and tossing it aside.  I saw his eyes glance over at the still open bedroom door.  "Let me get that," as he headed to the door, closing and then locking it.  I stood up and unbuttoned an unzipped my jeans, still leaving them resting on my hips, just waiting for his strong hands to push them down.  "You are so fucking hot," he replied as he knelt down in front of me, hands grazing my hips, coaxing the denim down my legs.  He kissed the skin as it was revealed, and I rested my hands on his shoulders as he delicately pulled my feet out of the jeans before throwing them aside.  He then noticed my pierced belly button and kissed my tummy before looking up and asking, "May I?"  I smiled and nodded as his tongue traced a path to the belly ring, flipping the metal around in his mouth.  His fingers danced slowly up the back of my legs until he reached the top of my panties.  He gently tugged at them, kissing his way from the body jewelry down to my pussy.  I pulled his head against me, as his mouth devoured me.  I had never been so horny in all my life.    Undoing his pants, Jason stood up to step out of them, revealing a much larger shaft than I had imagined.  I reached behind me, unhooking my bra and letting it fall limply to the floor.  He pulled me close for a kiss, and then lifted me up, my legs wrapping around him.  I imagined what it would be like for him to hold me up like that and fuck me just as we were.  He laid me down on the bed though, and fumbled with a condom that I hadn't seen him grab.  I spread my legs for him as he entered me with excrutiating slowness.  I wanted him to pound me feverishly, to satisfy my ever growing hunger.  But he took his time and very very slowly thrust himself in and out of my cunt.  I tried to raise my body up to his, forcing a quicker movement from him, but that only made him pull out completely.  "You're being bad," he smiled.  "I want you to fuck me!," I added, again bucking my body up against his.  He grabbed my wrists with his hands and held them down on the bed as he leaned down, sucking on my nipples, all the while his hair tickling the freshly kissed skin. I moaned in frustrated pleasure, as I felt his dick very slowly begin to enter me, gently parting my lips.  I refrained from moving, and was rewarded with harder, faster thrusts.  His long hair teased my nipples as he fucked me, balls slapping my ass.  I couldn't take it anymore, and my pussy massaged his cock as I came.  "Oh fuck, that feels good," he purred before he himself was coming, my cunt still hugging his pulsing dick.    I wanted to just lie there with him, to relish the moment or perhaps to have another go before the night was through.  But sense took over, and I suggested we get dressed, in case Rick woke up and decided he wanted to sleep off his hangover in his own bed.  And that was that.  Rick asked me out two weekes later, and I still see Jason on occasion, when he and Rick are headed out together somewhere.  Of course, we've never been intimate again.  I still think about his long silky hair though.

      That would be the sigh of a woman who is feeling rejected from her husband.  I'm grateful that Blogspot had scheduled down time last night.  Had I actually been able to publish my post last night....it would not be pretty.  To keep this short and sweet, as it is just me bitching, I will get to the point.  Rick left his mark in the office last night.  He was in there for two hours 'playing a new computer game'.  I would have had no idea, at least not last night, had I not gone in there to check my email.  I immediatly felt hurt, rejected, sad, you name it.  When his hand is so good to him, he doesn't seek me out.  Humor me and answer me this.  When you masturbate, are you not letting go of sexual tension?  I would trade every time I've ever masturbated, if it could have been replaced with a partner.  Am I being silly?  When I went back into the bedroom, as we were going to bed, I asked, "So what else were you looking at on the computer?"  "What do you mean?  I was just playing (insert game here).  I got disconnected alot, but thats all I was doing.  Why?"  "Wow," I add, "That really must have been an exciting game!  I had no idea."  Confusion followed by, "What do you mean?  Whats wrong?" Somewhere between there I told him that I felt rejected.  He got close and continued asking what was wrong, finally adding, "Tell me what I did so I can never do it again."  To that I laughed.  "Yeah right."  And that was that.  I hope he was playing dumb, because surely he knew.  BLECH!!!  Boys are yucky!!

      For those of you who may wish to try your hand at making some homemade tortillas, heres an authentic family recipe to sink your teeth into.  If I, as I fear, do poorly at describing the recipe, please feel free to ask questions.  And please!  If you make them, do tell me how they turned out!  Ingredients:  flour 1/2 cup oil 1 teaspoon baking powder salt large glass of warm water  Start by adding 1/2 bag of flour, oil, baking soda and a sprinkling of salt into a large mixing bowl with about half the amount of warm water to start.  You mix the dough with your hands, continuing to add water until the dough seems to be at a good consistancy to work with.  (not too sticky)  Be careful not to add too much water, as you will need to counter that with more flour to balance it, thus making the dough tough.    Once the dough is mixed and at a good working consistancy, begin making balls out of the dough, good sized ones, and shape them like you would a hamburger patty.  You will place the balls back in the large mixing bowl as you finish them, stacking them on top of eachother.  Afterwards, place a warm, wet dish towel over the bowl, and let it sit for about 30 minutes, enough to let the dough rise.    As the dough rises, begin heating your skillet, so its hot enough when the dough has risen.  After the thirty minutes, sprinkle some flour out on the counter and roll out the balls with a rolling pin.  You want them pretty thin.  Then place on the skillet and once it starts to bubble, you flip it to the other side.  You don't want to flip them more than twice or that too could make the dough tough.    To keep them warm, I lay out a dish towel and place the finished tortilla on one half of the towel, and cover it with the second half.  Once you get the hang of it, its really simple and most certainly better than the store bought variety.

      Close your eyes and imagine this.  You are in a dark room, unable to see anything.  As you are lying back in your seat, an unknown person comes up to you and begins giving you a blow job/eating you out.  Moments pass, everything feels great, and just as you are about to climax, the lights come on and you see that the source of your pleasure is a person of the opposite sex that you are attracted to.  (to clarify, what I mean by that is if you are a straight man, the person giving you a blow job is a man; if you are a gay woman, the person eating you out is a man.)  They continue to pleasure you, but knowing what you now know, are you still able to come?  Or are you just completely unable to, now that you know that the person's sex is not the sex you prefer?  Why do I ask such a silly question?  I suppose I'm trying to shed some light on something that happened to me several years ago with the guy I was dating.  We had been together for nearly a year, had made out, fooled around etc several times before.  One thing I always found odd about him (I'll call him Bill) is that he never once ejaculated.  No matter what we did, and believe me, I tried everything.  I vividly recall an extremely tiring blow job in the backseat of his car that lasted roughly 45 minutes before I finally gave up.  I was always too shy to ask what the problem was, but it drove me nuts!  Well, as my luck would have it, Bill came out of the closet about three years ago.  Is this the answer?  He wasn't attracted to me enough to come, because I had tits, not balls?  Was he just holding back?  Is that even possible?  This has gnawed at me for years.  lol  I have a reputation to uphold! hehehe  I would think though, that if someone was pleasuring you, regardless of their sex, you should be able to reach orgasm.  Am I wrong?  This could get some interesting replies...

      Hot Cha! You are:  69% Dateable! That's higher than the Worldwide Dateability Average of 63%!  Attractive and confident, witty and charming, a healthy ambrosia-based diet... you're wanted in the 48 contiguous states, you slayer. Call me. Seduce me. Not only do you know how to turn the engines on, but you also know how to oil, lube and rotate them. You put the "elation" back into "relationship," and the "night" back into "one-night stand."  Compared to 3,159,578 other test-takers...         72% less dateable than you — 8% like you — 21% more dateable than you  Some interesting statistics...    Women are LESS dateable than men.   Women average 63% dateable. Men average 63%.    10% would date their own clone.   21% want to be on reality TV.  And 35% have bad teeth.

      When Rick left for work this morning, he saw the pinto beans that I soaked over night on top of commenting, "Oh yeah!  You're making mexican food tonight."  I spent a good part of the day making home made tortillas, picadillo, mexican rice, chili con lluevos, you name it. Rick loves mexican food, and this is all from recipes passed down from my grandpa's family.  I don't mind making it because I know he enjoys it so much.   Two hours after hes supposed to be home, I get a call telling me he met up with his buddy after work and that they're in a restaurant having dinner.  Ummmm...right.  "But don't worry, I can just take what you made for lunch tomorrow."  Too bad I already dropped it all off to my parents house.  Anybody in the mood for some mexican food?  I know where you can get some really good fresh made.  Guess Rick will be eating bologna tomorrow.

        We were talking in the lumber section of a Lowe's store (I fondly recall the scent of the wood) and I remember looking around, making sure there was no one around us.  When I was satisfied that we had ample privacy, I grabbed his hand and took his finger into my mouth, circling it with my tongue.  He too began looking around making sure no one was around, before he took the finger I was kissing and probed underneath my skirt.  I sat on a pile of pallets behind me, spreading my legs for him.  He continued to finger fuck me as he bent down, parting my lips for a good view before teasing me with his tongue.  As he did this, I pulled off my shirt and started pinching my nipples, oooing and ahhing as his mouth made circles around my clit.  "Fuck me.  I want your dick inside of me right now!", I moaned, as I licked my finger and then rubbed circles around my nipple, savoring the tingling sensation that caused.  "You want me to fuck you right here?" he asked, somewhat surprised at my request.  I then pulled him up against me by his belt, feeling his rock hard dick through his jeans pressing up on my pussy, my juices and his kisses leaving a wet spot on his pants.  "Are you telling me you don't want to stick that dick of yours into my pussy that you so kindly help moisten?"  At that he started unzipping his jeans, pulling his cock out through his fly.  I very clearly recall his hands, they were nothing like Rick's, dark and rough from working outside in the sun, with what looked like mechanics fingernails, in that they appeared to have the residual stain of motor oil and grease upon them.  He smelled musty, but clean and the smell of the nearby lumber was intoxicating.  He plunged himself deep inside of me, I could feel the rough texture of his zipper and his jeans on my ass and inner thighs as he thrust in and out of me.  The feeling was intense, I was getting lost in the pleasure of the moment......  And it was then that my mind began to let go of the dream, my nose forgetting the mystery man's scent, the smell of the fresh lumber fading.  The rough pallet became the soft sheets of my bed and where once there was a lover between my legs, there now was only bed linens.  I refused to open my eyes, as that would surely rip me from whatever pieces of the dream I still clung to.  My pussy still felt full and tingled from the remaining memory.  I took a deep breath, putting all my senses back into the moment, and as I squeezed my thighs together my body was taken over by warm waves of ecstasy, climaxxing for minutes as my body remembered the erotica that was my dream.   I'm not sure why, but everytime I am in a home improvement store, the smell of lumber gets me all hot and bothered.  Add all the manly men, bronzed from the sun and dirty from their work, and I'm a puddle! It was only a matter of time before they entered my dreams, and I'm ever so grateful that they did!

      As I earlier brought up to wilde_thought, and as some of you may already know, there was quite an interesting story submitted as a comment a few weeks ago that has since gone unfinished.  I would absolutly LOVE to hear the intended ending, but in lieu of that, I would be equally pleased to hear some submissions from others.  It can be as romantic or raunchy as you like.  Whether or not you have any previous writing skills, I'd love to hear what you may come up with.  Just put yourself right in the story and write away!  Heres a refresher, for those who've missed it:  At 12:23 AM, Anonymous said…  L went to bed and, before she knew it, she was in Morpheus's land...  She began dreaming, and somehow appeared in a green, lush garden. She was laying on the grass, wearing a summer dress, on top of a blanket. A slight breeze carried the perfume from the flowers that were all around her. Soft bird chirps could be heard in the distance. She breathed deeply and thought "what a beautiful place... how can it get any better?".  She stretched as the gentle sun rays caressed her skin, and closed her eyes. "This is so nice..." she thought.  The wind began blowing a bit stronger, and her dress rose against her hips. The breeze caressed and kissed her thighs and tummy. "Oops", she thought. "I thought I was wearing underwear. Well, it doesn't matter, nobody else is here". The smell also became a bit stronger, but it was still very pleasant...   She rolled over and let the wind caress her back. Her dress was now up to her waist, but she didn't care. She felt free, happy, without a worry in the world. All of a sudden, a few raindrops fell against her back. The smell became just a tad stronger, but it was still sweet... like jasmine.  The breeze was caressing her back, sending shivers down her spine. She felt goosebumps, but it was a pleasant sensation. The raindrops felt warm against her skin, and began traveling down her back. She felt them making a little pool at the small of her back, and the smell of jasmine surrounded her.  All of a sudden, she felt a gentle touch, like of a feather being rubbed down her back, She knew she was alone, and wondered where that came from. The touch was so nice and gentle that soon she didn't mind... the touch became that of warm, loving hands. Those hands began travelling all over her back, from her shoulders to her lower back, rubbing the rain against her. She moaned slightly as she felt her muscles relax, and the goose bumps come back.  A voice was heard near her... "You are so beautiful and sexy... and I love you so". The voice sounded familiar yet a bit distant. The hands never stopped rubbing her back, her sides, the back of her neck, the top of her buttocks... the warmth from the raindrops spread all over her back and she felt content. She felt a kiss on the back of her neck, and she opened her eyes slightly.  Out of nowhere, a bedroom side table appeared, with a warm bottle of jasmine oil on top of it. The kisses on her back continued. She was being kissed everywhere: the back of her head, her shoulders, her neck, her sides, the back of her legs... she felt loved. The voice spoke again... "I love you, L". She woke up to find herself laying on her tummy, hot jasmine oil on her back, candles around the room, and soft music playing. D's was laying next to her, with a happy smile and a loving gaze. "Did you enjoy your surprise?" he whispered. "I sure did", K whispered back. The jasmine smell was intoxicating and she felt happy and relaxed.  D kissed her passionately and said "I need to kiss every inch of your body, I cannot resist it". K giggled and stretched once more, as D began kissing her mouth, her chin, her neck, and began moving lower...   Lets hear what you've got, loves!  xoxo

      It really takes alot to piss me off, and I am uber pissed right now. I don't want to come off as an unappreciative spoiled wife, because I'm not.  I know my husband works very hard to allow me to stay at home with our son.  I understand that therefore, certain jobs around the house are my responsibility and I am absolutly fine with that.  I make Rick breakfast every morning, pack a lunch for work and have dinner ready for him when he comes home.  I do the cooking, the cleaning, the laundry, the shopping, the child rearing, the pet care, the decorating etc.  I also do alot of 'mens' work around the house.  I did all the painting, put up the trims and moldings in the rooms, installed the ceiling fans, do all the plumbing, kill all the spiders (Ricks afraid of em), use to change the oil in the cars but thank God we just pay to do that now, and so on and so on.  The only chore he has here is to cut the grass, which takes maybe half an hour, as we have a small yard.  Well the lawn was looking extra shitty today because it was too rainy last week for him to cut it, so its really overgrown.  Yet, he refused to cut it today because its too hot.  WHAT?!  Its only 85 degrees out today!  Thats mild for a July day out here!  Its fuckin' summer for Christs sake!  Of course its fuckin' hot!  Its gonna be hot till October!  Get over it!  So I had to do the grass too, on top of every other goddamned thing around here.  God I'm a bitch!  But Jesus Christ!  Okay.  Deep breaths.  Hope nobody read that.

      On Saturday and Sunday mornings, when Rick doesn't have to get up and go to work, theres usually lots of teasing going on in bed once one of us wakes up.  I'll lightly brush my fingers across his semi hard dick, and then he'll recipricate by grazing his finger tips against my nipples and so on back and forth.  Sometimes, usually, it leads to morning sex, and other times it just heats things up to be tended to later.  We teased each other back and forth this morning for nearly half an hour, before I said, "Okay.  Its time to get up.  Lets get dressed and get the little monster."  As I stood up and stretched, Rick also got up, stretching before me.  Just as I was headed to the bathroom, Rick grabbed me by the shoulders and threw me on the bed as he pulled his dick out of his boxers.  He stroked himself as he climbed up onto the bed and between my legs.  Quickly he rammed his cock deep inside of me and began feverishly pounding at me.  I smiled, knowing that my teasing had gotten the best of him this morning.  He nibbled at my nipples, as I grazed my fingernails along his back, all the while never breaking his pace.  He grunted and moaned, every sound getting me that much more excited.  His face began to twist into that familiar look as he exploded all over my pussy and tummy.  Then he jumped up and said, "Okay.  Its time to get up.  Lets get moving!"

      that makes the 300+ pound man decide that its a good day to walk his dog outside, wearing only a pair of faded Speedos that look ready to pop at the seams?  Not to mention that he looked greasy and dirty, and had so much back and chest hair that Rick did a double take, thinking he was wearing some odd type of shirt.  If he was in the privacy of his own backyard, fine, so be it.  But out in public?!  I gotta hand it to him.  They guy had some balls.  I just didn't need/want to see them on a Saturday morning outing with my family.

      Rick and I play lots of board games together, so the thought of an adult board game is somewhat intriguing.  (click title link, blah blah)  Would he want to play this game, I wonder?  It preludes to sex, so I can't see why not.  I just wonder what his take would be on it.  Give me your thoughts, please.  I'd love to know what you think.  We don't currently own any 'adult' board games, but have turned many a game of Scrabble, etc into a strip tease. We're sick, what can I say? lol

      Oh my goodness!  I'm sure he doesn't need any publicity from me, but you have got to visit Mike Toole's blog, Blogging Like I've Never Blogged Before. (see link to right)  This dream entry he wrote yesterday had me laughing all day and later telling my husband all about it.  I just adore his sense of humor!!  Heres said dream entry:  Wednesday, July 07, 2004 Posted 7/7/2004 by mike  I know it's boring to talk about dreams, but this one might make me my millions.  Today at work, someone started talking about "that girl from Charles In Charge." Someone said Nicole Eggert. As soon as I heard the Charles In Charge talk, my brains started throwing all of these images at me, and all of the sudden I was thinking, Why do I have these bizarre distinct memories of talking to Scott Baio?  Then it hit me. Last night I dreamt that I approached Willie Aames about doing a spin-off of Charles In Charge, where the main character would be Buddy Lembeck. For some reason, we were on the set of Charles, and the entire cast was there, including the not hot sister of Nicole Eggert.  Anyway, Willie Aames didn't even remember his character from the show so it was going to take some convincing. I remember Scott Baio telling him that it was a great idea and he should do it.   The premise of the show was that Buddy was going to be a lawyer. That's all I really remember, but on my lunch break I thought of a few more details.  First thing you might ask is, "Buddy was a dummy. How can he be a lawyer?" Well, due to a paperwork mishap, Buddy passes the Bar Exam with flying colors and opens up his own practice. The man whose paperwork got confused with Buddy's, Reginald Fertabagular III, now makes it his life's work to bring down Buddy and his law firm, which Buddy calls Lembeck, Lembeck & Buddy.  So now Buddy has a rival. Reginald eventually does pass the Bar Exam and opens up his own law firm which tries to steal all of Buddy's clients.   Buddy wins all of his cases by pure dumb luck. He will say something in the middle of a trial which has nothing to do with the case, but then something will trigger in his brain and he will win the case.  For example, during a high profile murder case in which is client is wrongly accused of killing his wife, Buddy says to a bailiff, "You think you could rustle me up some peanuts?"  Then Buddy snaps and thinks, "Wait! Peanuts! That's just it! It would have been impossible for my client to be guilty because he loves peanuts!"  I'm not sure how that works, but you get the idea. This show would be unprecedented in that it is unheard of for a spin-off to not begin until 14 years after a show has been cancelled. And one that was created in a dream.  Willie Aames, your time is now! You haven't worked in years. Just look at your imdb profile. Call me.

      As we were settling into bed last night, Rick licked his finger and started to tease my pussy.  With my moan of approval, he quickly dove his finger in deeply and quickly, in and out for about a minute.  I felt his hard on pressed against my ass, trying to will it inside of me with only the powers of my mind.  He was quick to oblige, as he slicked the tip of his dick with the juices from his fingers and plunged it deep into my cunt.  I gasped at the surprise of the action, as he pounded away.  I was lying on my left side with Rick behind me, holding my right leg straight up in the air as he fucked me.  I squeezed my pussy muscles around his hard cock, and heard his moaning before he quickly came on my thigh and ass.  He wrapped my right leg around his left shoulder and my left leg wrapped under his right arm and rested on his back as he rubbed my clit and kissed my thigh, teasing it with his tongue.  I felt like a misshaped pretzel, but things were getting attention in spots that normally aren't as easily accessed, so the silly pose was good to me.  I felt the wave of an orgasm hitting, and let out a moan that would put a porn star to shame.  As the waves of climax were slowing down, Rick started feverishly rubbing my clit again, his mere touch send me straight into another orgasm.  I was surprised, and I think he was too, as I could see his smile even in the dark before he kissed me good night.

      Been looking around doing a bit of lingerie shopping and came across the ever popular shelf bra.  (click title link, blah blah)  Not much of a bra, but its pretty sexy none the less.  Imagining pairing it together with some tanga panties and a sheer robe.  And of course the fuckmepumps.  Hmmmm....I definitely like it though.  I sometimes have to wonder if guys even really care about a sexy negligee.  Anyone care to comment?  Does it matter if you woman gets dolled up for you?  I enjoy the sexy feeling I get from it anyway, but as I said, I just wonder how much the men appreciate it.

      What exactly is it that is so appealling about anal sex to guys?  Just curious.  Is it because its tabboo?  Because all the porn stars are doing it?  Or is it really something thats so great that it worthy of constantly seeking?  Funnily enough, I was the one who brought up anal sex to Rick a couple years ago.  If my memory serves me, he said something along the lines of, "Thats just not something I think I could get into" as he made a bit of a surprised face that I had even brought up such a thing.  I thought of that response Sunday night, as he lubed the tip of his dick with his spit before squeezing it into my ass.  I normally prefer that he use a condom for that, because he gets me all hot and bothered to where I want him to fuck my pussy afterwards, but that night, I just let it slide.  I was lying on my side and he just got up and wrapped his body around me, embracing me tightly as he slid his cock in and out of my backdoor.  I felt warm and loved and safe.  He breathed heavily in my ear, letting out little grunts and moans before tensing up and coming inside me.  I felt every pulse and spasm of his dick letting go in me.  It was nice, but left me wanting more.    Last night on Nip/Tuck, Sean's wife had a similar dilema.  They had a round of morning sex, during which she hadn't come, so when Sean jumped in the shower, she finished the job.  I think my tongue was bleeding from biting it so hard.  I can't count how many times I've busted out my vibrator as Rick showered after a morning romp.  I don't always have to orgasm to enjoy sex, but its nice to be at least thought of!  Oh well.    There was a bit of talk of voyeurism on sexat26 today.  A particular memory came flashing to mind from many years ago.  Me and Rick had been together for about 6 months, so I guess I was about 18.  We worked together at the time and had quite a few friends who also worked with us.  We liked to have Motel 6 parties, which was basically just all of us renting a room and getting lots of booze and hanging out together.  This worked well, as there weren't too many houses we could go to where their parents wouldn't mind us drinking.  (funny how parents are lol)  Anyway, there were two other couples there with us, along with two other male friends.  We were in a room with two beds, and we snagged one bed, and Betty and Archie took the bed next to us and Eric and Donna took a blanket and pillows to the floor, leaving the two guys with no pillows or blankets, but I digress.  I laid down in the bed because I was getting sleepy and Rick jumped in next to me, pulling the sheets over our heads and kissing me with gusto that only a drunk man can possess.  There were a few whistles and comments, which seemed to egg Rick on.  He pulled off his shirt and pants, throwing them on the floor, still under the sheets and starting pulling at my clothes.  I was hesitant at first, the room was full of people for God's sake!  But at the same time, that thought was very exciting to me.  So I let Rick undress me, adding my clothes to the pile.  Now everyone's attention was on us, the two guys were tugging at the bed linens and giving a play by play to the best of their knowledge.  Eric turned off the lights, and I know Betty and Archie got into bed then to, also getting frisky under the covers.  With the lights off, there was still enough moon light to make out everything that was happening.  I heard the two other couples adding their clothes to the pile and felt very naughty.  This was also the first time Rick went down on me, and my moans got quite a few giggles around the room.  I peeked my eyes around the room, making out the figures that were fucking, and noticed that one of the guys was sitting in the corner of the room closest to us with his dick out in his hand, jerking off as he watched us.  We were young and drunk and stupid, but it was a hot experience, that was a once in a lifetime kind of deal.  The next morning, both my bra and thong underwear were missing.  I know who took it, but acted clueless just the same.  Perhaps voyeurism is like anal sex in that it is a tabboo that while you know you aren't really supposed to do it, its exciting, it feels good and gets you off just the same.

      The conclusion to The Mystery Man!  Enjoy.  The next two days drove Karrie crazy. This man who made love to her so fine just had her thought process completely a mess and concentrating on work was almost impossible. Luckily the boss was pleased with her project and he left her alone for the rest of the week.  On her way home Friday she stopped and got some of her favorite wine coolers. When she got home she put on her favorite nightshirt popped open a wine cooler and flipped through the pages of her high school annual. The pictures brought back warm memories but no clue to her lover. Somewhat frustrated she tossed the book aside and downed a couple more wine coolers. She then couldn't help but reminence how this man fucked her and how satisfied she felt after both encounters. As she thought, her hands started massaging her tits and she began pulling her nipples through the thin material of her nightshirt. Her hands then made there way to her panties and rubbed her crotch spreading her legs wide and she fingered herself through the thin material. She then sat up and stripped herself naked and got into her night stand and got out her vibrating egg. She layed back and turned on the egg and rubbed her toy over her nipples and then guided the toy down her flat tummy and down to her light brown pubes teasing her pussy lips making her hot cunt want the little intruder. After teasing herself enough she spread her pussy lips apart and put her toy right on her clit. She turned the vibrator to high and let out a moan as it's little motor started it's massage on her love nub. it didn't take long for a strong cum go through her. But then she took the egg and pushed it into her hot honey hole and rolled over on her stomach. And as she worked her sugar walls around her little pleasure maker she slid her hands undreneath her and her fingers attacked her clit she came hard and put her into a deep sleep for the night.  Finally Satuday night came. She wore her favorite light blue summer dress that showed off her long tanned legs and cut low enough to show off her 38C tits. As she got to The Plaza she went to the main desk and asked for room 17. She asked who the room was registered to but he said he wasn't suppose to say. She went to the room. A note on the door said to go in have a drink and sit in the chair in the middle of the room. Put on the blindfold. She went in and on a stand was a boquet of flowers, a cooler with her favorite wine coolers and beer. She got a cooler sat in the chair and put on the blindfold.  She heard the door open and He said "You don't know how glad I am to see you. I've been in love with you since the 10th grade. And when I took a job as a night watchman at our building I couldn't wait to come and say hello. "So why this game" Karrie asked. "For one I was thought you would just remeber me as that sweet guy from school. And two when I came to say hi I caught you in the act of pleasuring yourself and the oppurtunity was just too hard to pass up." Karrie's cheeks blushed on the thought of being caught. "Now we did have many classes together. My favorite was 7th period study hall two years in a row." Karrie thought for a moment but it didn't come to her. "Who got you through American Government" And like a giant light bulb she shouted "ANDY" She pulled off the blindfold and she was right. If it wasn't for him she never would have passed. And Andy was one of the sweetest guys in school but never thought of him as a raging hose monster as she has found through their encounters. Now are you going to stay and without hesitation she threw her arms around him kissed him and said yes.  Andy had dinner reservations. And after dinner he took her dancing. It was a wonderful evening and Karried was surprised at how Andy was so charasmatic.  As they returned to the room Andy gave Karrie a small bag which contained a white teddy and a pair of crotchless panties. She went to the bathroom to put them on. Before coming out she spayed a bit of perfume between her tits and then just above her pussy hairs. As she entered the room Andy was there in silk boxers and the expression on his face spoke anthems. After a drink he led her to the bed. As they kissed his fingers found their was to the opening of her panties and he slowly rubbed her love button. His touch was magical and a small climax went through her body.   He then went to the end of the bed and before she knew it he had her pussy over his face. He pulled apart the opening of the panties and his toungue made its way to her swollen pussy lips finding her erct clit.  Now Karrie was never been a big fan of sucking cock. But for the first time in her sexual life she never wanted anything more badly than to take this mans tool in her mouth. She pulled down Andy's boxers and his cock bopped right into her face. Her tongue hungrily lapped up his precum and she nibbled on his peehole she took his big purple head into her mouth and with each suck took him deeper into her hot mouth. She tickled his balls with just her finger nails which made Andy let out a low moan of pleasure. And everytime Andy gave a nibble on Karrie's hot clit she returned the favor by letting his big cock out of her mouth and nibblling the end of his at cock.   As they sucked each other in unison the orgasm building in Karrie's body made her let go of Andy's cock sit up straight and ride his face until the she exploded her juices all over his face and he happily lapped up all he could. After catching her breath she straddled his big cock and slowly took all nine inches into her steaming cunt. He reached up and gave her hard melons a squeeze and rubbed her nipples with his fingers. She then teasingly just fucked the head of his cock which drove Andy crazy she then slammed her ass down hard and grinding her pussy squeezing his cock with her pussy walls. She felt the head of his cock starting to expand and she rode him as hard as she could til he let out a scream and his spermjuice flooded her pussy and as she collapsed on top of her new lover and ready to sleep in arms. Completely satisfied.

      We got a book club catalog in the mail just the other day, that had a separate little flyer in it marked Video Vixens, Sexy Anime and More.  Rick looked at it and laughed, setting it aside.  He was looking through the catalog marking books he would like, (birthday coming up), and then I added, "If you'd like one of those videos, thats fine too, just mark which one you'd like."  I tried with every fiber of my being, not to laugh, or act surprised when he picked up the flyer again and remarked, "Well, I just think they would be funny."  This man has never bought porn or sex toys or even showed any outside interest in such things in his life.  I even order his Playboy for him.  Not that he doesn't enjoy the stuff once we have it, but I NEVER expected him to admit to me, to my face no less, that he wanted a pornographic tape, even if it is japanime.  The mere idea got my juices flowing.  I ordered it that same day, and will probably add it to the anniversary gifts.  Today I found it eight bucks cheaper (click title link above) and wouldn't ya know it, my previous order was already submitted.  Oh well.  A step in the right direction.  Then yesterday, as Rick was on the computer looking up free games, he found a free strip poker game.  The catch?  The girls are japanime.  Oh my.  Is this a fetish emerging? lol  Just a funny coincidence I think.  But he wasn't shy about telling me he found the strip poker game, so as I said before, it looks like we're making progress.  I'll get him over that shyness yet!

      Well sometimes it just sucks to be responsible.  Looks like we'll be holding off on the super lavish hotel for our anniversary.  Getting a babysitter, while completely possible, seems like more trouble than its worth.  We just recently moved our son out of his crib and into a twin size bed, and at grandma's house she only has a playpen for him to sleep in that hes too big for, or a bed thats way too high off the ground and in a room filled with way too many things that he could get into and hurt him self with or otherwise just destroy.  To have grandma stay here with him is also a stretch, since shes recently had surgery and is having a tough time getting around.  Damn!  But on the plus side, we'll save money, right? lol  Gawd, I hate sounding all grown up and responsible!  When did this happen?!  So, it looks like we'll stay at home, and instead I'll just invest in some yummy smelling candles and create a romantic ambiance here.  Thats fine.  But damnit, I'm still getting my lingerie!!

      Rick was very grabby when he came home last night.  Not that I don't love the attention, but there is only so much you should do in front of a two year old.  He kept rubbing up against me with his raging hard on, and finding excuses to brush up against my chest, making my nipples hard.  Once the baby was in bed, he was attacking me with dry humps, just being silly.  It was 3/4 through the movie we were watching when he surprised me by flipping my skirt up around my hips and diving into my pussy with his tongue, devouring me as if I were his last meal.  It was fantastic!  Before long we were both naked, and he had me on my hands and knees as he ate me out and teased my clit with his fingers.  He then took his dick and rubbed it against my cunt, wetting it with the mixture of my juices and his kisses before plunging himself deep inside of me.  His hands opened up my lips as much as he could so he could watch his cock thrust in and out of me.  It was so hot.  What was even hotter, was his moans of pleasure, and his dirty talk.  God!  That really gets me going!  It sounds like we have sex every single day, but we really don't.  We just happen to be in a good pattern this week.  Usually we are intimate about three times a week, but sometimes its more or less.  Sometimes none at all.  And thats when I get pissy.  I don't think Rick ever goes without sex when he wants it, but I know I do.  And then I get angry, and feel rejected and even start to feel self conscious.  I guess I just assume that he should always be in the mood, no excuses. Ha!  Thats how we're raised to think, isn't it?  That guys only want one thing.  Oh well.  For now, all is good on that front.  Amen.

      Top 10 Dirtiest Foods Will Make You Sick Here's a top 10 list that'll make you lose your appetite. Men's Health magazine is out with the 10 dirtiest foods, from bad burgers and dangerous deli meats, to health foods that can be hazardous.  10. Scallions: Uncooked, these green onions become bacterial breeding grounds. Plus they've been linked to fatal outbreaks of Hepatitis-A.  9. Cold cuts: You may be lunching with Listeria, a dangerous bacteria that can kill infants and the elderly. The deli slicer spreads it and it can grow even in the fridge.  "I actually advise that you transfer the deli meat to a fresh package, and only store up for a week," said nutritionist Lisa Dorfman.  8. Pre-packaged tossed salads: They can be one of the biggest sources of food poisoning, because the contents are often contaminated with E. Coli.   7. Peaches: Because of the peach fuzz. It's hard to clean all the pesticide off.  6. Canteloupe: Dangerous bacteria on the rind is hard to wash off. Then they are often carried inside with an unclean cut of a knife.  "There's no question that the outside of the fruit is where potential problems are," said lab director Dr. Peter Kmieck.  5. Eggs: They're associated with over 600,000 cases of food poisoning each year and over 300 deaths.   "Eggs could be a really sickening product," Dorfman said.  4. Oysters: If eaten raw they'll leave you feeling that way. Many are tainted with the Norovirus and bacteria.  3. Ground turkey: One in four packages contain bacteria. It's a concern as people substitute ground turkey for ground beef.  2. Ground beef: Because of heavy processing, ground beef's often loaded with the potentially deadly E. coli bacteria and more.  1. Chicken: With more than 40 percent of samples in one study having sickening bacteria, it ranked number one because the lab found E. coli in the chicken samples.  The researchers say that's unusual, because E. coli is not part of the normal flora, or beneficial bacteria, of the chicken.  Now, whos hungry?

      Lets talk about porn, shall we?  Now, I know for a fact that my husband enjoys porn, because a)Hes a man and b)Hes a man.  I have NO PROBLEMS with that at all!  I must say that I too enjoy porn.  Is that really so odd?  My girlfriends cringe at the mere thought of such things, I get...excited.  Now, I know that its routine for men to watch XXX videos when they want some self lovin', but is that its sole purpose to men?  Wouldn't it be equally if not more enjoyable to watch it with their wife or girlfriend and get all hot and bothered and then top it all off with super hot sex? I would think so, but tell me if I'm wrong.  I have bought Rick porn, and we have watched a few together, but 99% of the time he chooses to be sneaky about it.  Why?  He does the same thing with internet porn.  Again, why?  If the sole purpose is to get off quickly, then why can't he watch the porn, or flip through the internet pictures while I, say, give him a blow job?  Let us both enjoy it!  I wouldn't expect anything in return.  I get off just knowing hes enjoying himself.  I guess really, what I'm saying is that I want him to get all things sexual, be it actaul fucking or even just a hand job, from me and me alone.  Thats just silly and unrealistic.  How can I say I'm jealous of my husband's hand?  lol  *sigh*  But, then too, I'm partly judging this by all the blogs I read from frustrated husbands who masturbate as a last resort.  I guess I assumed that since Rick is not in that position that he shouldn't have the need to masturbate. Perhaps I'm just a sex addict.  I never thought I'd be more into sex than Rick.  Hmmm...

      Lying in bed last night, Rick leaned over to kiss me good night, all the while reaching up my night shirt and sqeezing my breast.  I wanted to give him easier access, so I sat up and pulled off the shirt, giving him freedom to do as he chooses.  He decided to play with my breasts for what turned out to be quite a while, licking and sucking and adding little nibbles here and there while his hand rested on my inner thigh, not touching my pussy at all.  After a few minutes of the intense nipple stimulation, I started to feel a strange yet similar feeling.  Surely its not...  And then I was washed over in waves of ecstasy as I orgasmed without Rick ever once touching my pussy.  Not at all!  Seeing what he had done, he quickly dove down between my legs, attacking my swollen clit with his tongue and shoving his finger deep inside of me.  I was numb from all the yummy sensations pulsing through my veins.  Finally he flipped me over, grabbing my hips and pulling my cunt on top of his cock and fucked me hard and fast until he exploded.  I just collapsed in a pile on the bed, waiting for the sleep to take over, unable to move, just savoring the tiny tingling I still felt as Rick slapped my ass and told me good night.  I slept quite good last night!

      M.N., darling?  You have the pleasure of being my first!  My first link, that is.  Thought I'd never get it to work though.  Whew!  As I've stated before, I'm a blogger virgin, so its been quite the experience figuring out all the neat little tricks.  I believe a round of drinks is in order!  I'll take a margarita, thank you so much!

      With our anniversary soon approaching, I'm excited at the thought of getting some new lingerie.  I'm sure Rick appreciates it, but I think I get the most pleasure out of looking and feeling like a sex kitten.  I've quite the array of teddies, slip gowns, and thigh high lacy stockings along with a nice variety of fuck me pumps that match well to any and all of my collection.  I would really like to get a corset, and I've had my eye on a few.  Click the link to see one thats caught my fancy.  What I would really like, is for Rick to buy me something to wear for him.  I've asked him on several occasions to do so, to no avail.  I've even given him catalogs to shop from, should he be too shy to make such a purchase in person.  Still nothing.  *insert pouty lip here*  I would feel ten times as sexy, if I were wearing something that he picked out especially to see on my body.  Something he chose to feel as he grips my hips from behind and...well, you get the picture.  Now...Pink, or lilac?  Hmmm..  Choices, choices!

      Every time I lie out in the sun, I find I have to fight the strong urge to simply strip naked, letting the warmth and air kiss my breasts and nipples, to let the wonderous senstions that the sun light gives me carress every inch of my body, from head to toe.  We don't have the proper yard for doing that right now, and probably won't be house hunting again for another three years.  *sigh*  In the mean time, I've entertained the notion of using self tanner.  I'm just concerned that perhaps the color wouldn't match.  Wouldn't that be a strange sight!

      For those wondering what happened with the mystery man of last weeks tale:  Mystery Man Returns  Two weeks had past since Karrie had the wildest sex expierence of her life. She purposely stayed late 3 times to see if her lover would return. But he did not and she was ready to hang it up as one of those once in a lifetime happenings.  Her boss was on her ass about a project that needed to be done by the end of the week and she was determined to get it in early even if she had to stay until midnight Wednesday to get it done. Then she could cruise on Thursday and Friday with the usual business to take care of heading into the weekend.  Karrie's work went much quicker than she thought and around 9:00 she was ready to make her final copies and then head home to a hot bath and glass of wine. As she stood by the copier the voice was back. "Hello again" he said "Don't turn around". As much as she wanted to see this man the thought of her last encounter with him froze her and she just placed her hands on the copier. "I though you weren't coming back" She said.  "Oh I had every intention to come back to see you." He said and as he spoke the blindfold was once again placed over Karrie's eyes.  Karrie asked several questions in a row but was given no answer as his hands rubbed her shoulders, down her back and across her ass. He then turned her around and held her close. He then said " All your questions will be answered in time. But not now. But I will tell you that I'm a long time admierer." He then kissed her very gently with just the tip of his tounge brushing hers leaving her weak in the knees. He then took her hand and led her to an office where he shut and locked the door.  He led her to a desk and lifted her up to sit on it. She then felt his fingers fumble with her hair and then brushed her cheeks and across her lips. Like last time she heard that familiar hum of approval. He kissed her again firmer this time with his tounge deeper and she responded by curling her tounge around his. Karrie then felt his fingers begin to unbutton her blouse. He slowly pushed her blouse off her shoulders and it fell onto the desk. Her bra was easily removed and his hands slid slowly around her slim waiste and up to her huge orbs squeezing them firmly and flicking her dark hardened nipples making her let out a slow long moan. He then layed her back on the desk and he filled his hungry mouth with her huge nipple sucking and nibbling the tastey treat. While running a hand across her crotch and she instantly pushed her pussy up against his hand. Knowing she was under his control. After getting his feed of her big tits he undid her pants and quickly removed them taking her panties at the same time.   He then backed off and she new he was stripping. He then told Karrie to show him her pussy. She slowly spread her legs showing her swollen pussy lips with her clit peeking out. He then ordered her pull her lips apart. And she did revealing her leaking honey hole to him. She then felt his firm hands make their way up from her ankles, caressing her calves and inner thighs. He pulled her up from the desk and kissed her firmly and his fuck finger stoking her clit slowly round and round. As they kissed her hands caressed his firm and hairy chest and made her way down his flat stomach. She was impressed with muscle tone. As he kept with his finger massage on her clit driving her into a frenzy her hand found his huge erect cock at least 9 ot 10 inches of manhood there Karrie thought to herself. She was brought out of her thought as he plunged his finger deep into her drenched pussy that made her cum as she pumped her pussy walls around those magic fingers. He then pushed her back onto the desk and he grabbed both ankles speading her legs wide as they would go and she felt the large purple head of his monster cock at the entrance of her hot hole. He began fucking her with just the head of his cock inside her while a finger was rubbing her clit. She instantly came from the combination and he could feel her pussy pulling him in as she wanted more of his giant snake.  He then grabbed her ankles and shoved all 9 inches into her as hard as he could that made her wail in ecstacy and her eyes roll to the back of her head. After another hard orgasm or two as Karrie lost count. He pulled out of her as the orgasms passed through her quivering body.   She felt his hands upon her again and he carried her to a couch and layed her down. He kissed her gently as he settled down between her legs and re- entered her. And with the gentleness of big old teddy bear he made love to her. His huge cock slowly pumping in and out of her pussy. His kisses warm and gentle. Her legs locked around his buttocks. As another cum was building in her ravaged body she could feel the head of his cock expanding knowing that he was about to blow his hot juices. He whispered cum with me Karrie and with that he shot his wad and she came with him as ordered as this man now owns her body completely.  Laying exhausted she asked to remove the blindfold but he said no. Our next meeting everything wil be known he promised. He kissed her gently good night dressed and left. Karrie got up and found her clothes. As she went to the desk for her bra and blouse she found an envlope. She opened it and all it said was Room 17 The Plaza Hotel. Satuday at 8:00. She could hardly wait.

      What could have easily been a day filled with melancholy thoughts and a tear stained facade, was suddenly brightened upon fetching the mail.  I couldn't help but smile when I saw the magazine wrapped in black plastic.  Of course, I spent time in rememberance of Kevin.  It doesn't take the anniversary of his death for me to miss him and feel somber about the circumstances of his early departure.  But I also know that while a good cry is a wonderful release of tension and emotion, its not as good a release as what the carefully concealed magazine could potentially do for me.   I sometimes wonder if I don't get more excited about Rick's magazine arriving than he does.  Tearing open the plastic, I always feel naughty, like I shouldn't be seeing the contents that were so well hidden just moments ago.  It reminds me of sneaking peeks at my dad's magazines when I was younger, and I feel the same sensation of excitement building in my tummy as I did so many years before.  I find myself completely engaged at  urlLink this section , staring at the beautifully painted women, admiring both the art and ,of course, their curvacious figures.  I can't help but imagine what it would be like to be painted like that.  Wondering how the air brushing would feel on my skin, painting the most delicate areas, and having someone hand apply the jewels.  The art is amazing, the canvas' gorgeous.  Theres alot of pages of  urlLink olympians , their bodies well toned and tuned to precision for their event of expertise.  The well defined muscles are nice, but for the most part, they are all small chested.  Apparently I'm a boob girl, and I prefer to see a woman with a more well endowed bosom.  :)  They are, of course, still beautiful to look at.  But aren't all naked women?    urlLink The Advisor  has a description of the perfect blow job, which offered me no new tricks.  Actually, it sounded rather similar to what I already do.  Is it really that much of a mystery?  But then, I suppose that perhaps not everyone truly enjoys giving oral sex as I do, and may not do it as often.  I'm still confused as to why so many women are so scared to death of come, running from it like it is radioactive.   Looking at the images, reading the articles, I found myself feeling excited.  I always have.  I imagined what pictures, which models would turn Rick on.  Which pictures he would spend more time on than others.  I imagined his dick stirring beneath his shorts as he admired the naked bodies, hoping he would use that energy on me later.  It wasn't long before my fingers lightly grazed over my pussy, circling the smooth skin with my finger tips, putting pressure near my clit.  I was so turned on, I knew it would be easy to come multiple times, and I did.  I spent the better part of the afternoon in pure self indulgence, pleasuring myself as I saw fit.  The release was heavenly, relaxing both my body and my mind.  I'd rest awhile, thinking I was done.  And then I'd decide to go for another one, and another one.   I could have taken a blissful nap, relishing after my gluttonous feast of orgasms.  But Rick would be home soon, and there was house work to be done.  Perhaps he could serve me a few for dessert tonight.  One can only hope.

      Bystanders ignore pleas of man slain at bus stationBoy, 12, calls police after adults walk away from dying man By Associated Press    KALAMAZOO -- A schizophrenic man allegedly told his brother he heard voices that told him to kill a stranger in a bus station bathroom.    Now, Kevin Heisinger -- on his way home to Illinois from orientation at the University of Michigan's social work program -- is dead.    He was beaten to death Thursday within earshot of people who never tried to help and never called police, even after they found the 24-year-old dying in a pool of blood, police say.    It was a 12-year-old who finally reported the fatal attack, police say.    Ypsilanti resident Brian Williams, 40, who has suffered from 20 years of schizophrenia, is in jail on a murder charge. He was arraigned in Kalamazoo on Friday and is being held without bond. He will undergo a psychiatric evaluation.    Williams is charged with killing Heisinger as both men were on their way to Chicago: Heisinger to return home before he started his master's degree in Ann Arbor; Williams to see his father.    The two men allegedly met in the station bathroom, Executive Lt. Thomas Martin of the Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety said.    Several Kalamazoo-area residents expressed outrage that nobody tried to help Heisinger during or after the fatal beating. But there is no law in Michigan that holds bystanders accountable for not helping someone being victimized, Kalamazoo Prosecuting Attorney James Gregart said.    No one is believed to have seen what happened in the bathroom. But Martin said several people heard Heisinger call "stop" and "help." When a man did go in to use the bathroom, Martin said, he turned around and walked out after seeing Heisinger lying in a pool of blood. The man then went for coffee at the McDonald's restaurant across the street.    Another man found Heisinger unconscious with labored breathing. He, too, left without calling for help.    The police have a substation at the bus and train terminal.    Finally, Martin said, a 12-year-old boy "asked the adults 'What are you doing?' and called for help."    Elizabeth Kutsche said she was angered by the apathy shown during the Thursday murder.    "I don't know how to express my disgust and shock," she said. "It's beyond words. I don't understand these people because they can do these things anonymously if they don't want to get involved."    For Gregart, it was another example of society becoming "tragically impersonal."    "Regrettably, I've seen too many instances where people lack caring and compassion for others -- and that involves domestic violence and child abuse," he said.    The adults gave police no explanation for not helping Heisinger, Martin said.    "Had somebody interrupted this in some way, jumped, yelled, shouted, we might be investigating an assault and battery, rather than a homicide," Martin said.    Williams' brother, Detroit attorney Amos Williams, said Friday that his brother Brian is mentally ill. He is intelligent, brother to three engineers, two of whom graduated from the University of Michigan, and a retired lieutenant colonel in the Army.    Amos Williams says his brother's intelligence makes his mental illness harder.    "It would be better, he would have less psychic pain, if he were less intelligent. But he knows he's trapped. Even at times when he's on his medication, it breaks my heart. Once, he sat down and cried. He said, 'look at you guys, and look at me,' " Amos Williams said.  I can't stand to hear the asshole who killed him described as a victim.  I don't feel sorry for him at all.  And to the pricks who couldn't be bothered enough to help save his life, I hope we never meet.

      I know I hold some controversial views on crazy people.  I believe I have a right to though.  I was traumatized, molested and nearly raped by a paranoid schizophrenic who refused to take his medication.  That would be my current father in law.  One of my dearest, closest friends was brutally murdered by a paranoid schizophrenic who refused to take his medications.  He was only 24, and the nicest man you would EVER meet.  Today is the four year anniversary of his death.  I have this funny belief that its unfair to let ticking time bombs roam around society, able to kill at a moments notice because "the voices" told them to.  They should be detained, and kept away from normal society.  I say 'normal' loosely, meaning only those mentally capable of not doing stupid crazy shit all the time with a sickness as an excuse.  In my utopian society, they would be no more.  But don't mind me, I'm bitter.   Its crazy people that cost me my medicine career, not my laziness or indecision that I so often like to blame.  I didn't/don't want to save a crazy person's life.  I would sooner have them die beneath my hands than bring them back and let them loose to reek havoc.  That sounds crazy doesn't it?  But its true, and thankfully I realized my feelings before throwing myself into a hospital setting.  Who am I to play God?  These feelings of rage, the thought of being unable to treat a patient because of their mental illness, are unsettling.  But its the truth, and I've laid it out for all to see.  Does that make me a bad person?  Perhaps not bad, but definetly bitter.  Today I dedicate my blog to Kevin, my friend who was killed four years ago today.  Though, I'm sure he would have been shocked at the content of my blog, lol, I know he would appreciate the dedication.  Its a sad day, but I make it sad.  I play the sad music, look at old pictures and letters.  Perhaps saddest of all is reading the newspaper article describing his death.  So sensless.  What is so annoying, is that I know Kevin would have forgiven the dick that murdered him.  Thats just how he was.  All my love, Kevin. xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo

      I dated a police officer for about six months a few years ago.  He often came by the house after work in his squad car, which of course made the neighbors come out in groves to see what was going on.  You'd think they would catch on, but rather, they came out like clock work, watching and waiting for some big dramatic scene.  My mother was mortified.  His name was David.  It would be a good story to say we met when he pulled me over, and rather than give me a ticket, I charmed my way out of it with an amazing blow job.  Love at first blow. lol  That didn't happen.  Actually we met under an even more entertaining occasion.  At a donut shop.  Honest to God truth.  lol  I was picking up some donuts for work, and he was picking up donuts for, well, himself.  Having not ever been one for junk food or donuts, I really had no idea what to get.  The donut lady- I don't know what else to call her, I didn't know her name, she was just the donut lady- was getting aggravated with me for taking so long.   "You act like you've never bought donuts before," he laughed.  "Actually, I haven't."  He looked surprised and then amused.  "Well then, I'll help you out."  He then proceeded to place my order for me, which all my coworkers agreed was perfect.  Of course it was!  A professional donut eater picked them out!  Poor cops.  They have such a terrible reputation.  But my God, he and his friends could do some damage to the pasty delights!  But I digress.  Somewhere in small talk, he had asked where I worked.  Nothing special, until four hours later when all of a sudden the office gets dead silent, save for the desperate whispers.  The receptionist seeks me out and very quietly and calmly tells me that there is a police officer at the front desk that would like to talk to me.  Of course, I was scared to death!  You'd think I had robbed a bank on the way to work, as scared as I felt.  I suppose it was just a natural reaction, fearing the cops.  Funny, isn't it?  But I was scared silly, my heart in my throat as I took the walk of shame to the front, coworkers whispering as I passed, wondering what I had done.   Upon seeing David, I wondered what I had done.  Did he follow me and catch me speeding or something?  That was hours ago!   "Hi...." I manage to squeak.  "Mind if we step outside?" he asks.  Oh shit!  Oh Shit!  Oh shit!  I felt all eyes on me as we stepped through the doors.  I waited through bated breath to find out what was wrong.  His serious look changed to a smile as he asked, "So how'd they like the donuts?"  Big sigh of relief, and I playfully slap him.  "You had me scared to death!"  I laughed.  "Why?  Guilty conscious?  Or did you think I followed you and caught you speeding or something?"  "No!  Of course not.  Thats silly!"  He had no clue..lol  We started dating that evening.  I really liked David.  He was very sweet and I felt very safe and secure around him.  (of course I did, he was a cop!)  He had two children, which didn't bother me at all, because I have always loved children and wanted some of my own anyway.  The problem with David was his ex wife.  Ugh.  Ultimately, she was the demise of our relationship.   It started with hang up calls in the middle of the night.  Not long after, I received a 27 page letter from her, front and back.  27 separate pieces of paper, crazy scratchings on BOTH sides.  My God.  Accusing me of being a homewrecker, of stealing her husband away, of being a whore.  Whatever.  When her daughter started to call me mommy, I knew she'd go nuts.   I was right.  David was constantly apologizing, and then threatening her with a restraining order.  She was a druggie and used to leave her children home alone when they were babies so she could go out and find a fix.  She didn't even lock the door, not that that would make it any less heinous.   The worst part of the whole degeneration of the coupling was, of course, the children.  I had genuinly grown to love them, and felt conflicted in leaving David because I didn't want his children to be hurt.  But his ex wife was just too much for me.  I couldn't handle it.  He had picked me up on his way home from work in his squad car.  Not much was said on the short drive to his house.  He pulled into the garage and shut the door as we got out.  I leaned against the car, pulling him close to me.  My fingers tracing the engraving of his name badge, feeling the pressure of his belt pressing up against my belly.  I could see it in his eyes.  His face smiled at me, but his eyes were sad, looking into mine and trying to foresee the inevitable.   "Kiss me," I whispered.  He leaned in, meeting my mouth with his.  As our tongues met, I suddenly thought to myself that we could work this out, that his ex was just a minor speed bump.  His smell was intoxicating to me, I breathed him in deeply as my fingers found the buttons on his shirt.  He reached down, removing his belt and placing it on top of the car, then pulling off my shirt and kissing the top of my breast.  My head fell back, my neck limp from the delicious comfort of his kisses.  This could work.  We could figure something out.  I so desperatly wanted myself to believe that.  With renewed passion, I stripped him of his clothes, my mouth never leaving his.  I felt his warm hands coaxing off my clothes as well until we were both exposed to each other, desperatly yearning to be closer.  He fidgeted with the back door of the squad car, before opening it.  "Here, climb in."  As I turned around, he bent me over, my hands resting on the back seat as he entered me from behind.  I felt so full,  and yet ironically so empty.  I stood up and turned around, kissing him as he lay me down on the backseat.  He leaned down kissing and kneading my breasts, licking a trail down my belly where he flicked my navel ring with his tongue.  The look on his face was desperate.  Like he was trying to prove something to me with his loving caresses.  I closed my eyes, unable to bear the intensity anymore.  He entered me slowly, letting the full length of his cock rest deep inside of me before removing it and beginning to thrust.  His movements quickened, fucking me with agonizing dedication.  It felt nice, but I felt removed from the experience.  He stopped without coming, pulling me up out of the car and tightly embracing me.  He kissed my neck in silence, waiting for me to speak.  I couldn't find the words.  "You're leaving me, aren't you?"  We dressed in deafening quietness before he drove me home.  One last desperate plea with his eyes that I could barely stand to see.  He knew why I was leaving.  He knew it was because of her.  He drove away just as the sun plunged beneath the horizon.  The symbolism was impossible to ignore.

       urlLink    I think, if I had to choose the best time of the weekend, it would be Saturday and Sunday mornings, when Rick takes care of the baby long enough for me to take a nice hot shower.  I let the hot water soothe my neck muscles and just relax in the steamy room until the water goes cold.    &nbsp; urlLink

      Why are men so hesitant to go to the doctor?  Do you somehow think that toughing out the pain makes you more attractive in some way?  It doesn't.  Rick's back has been giving him problems since late last month.  I made him a chiropractors appointment right away, only to have him cancel it.  "I don't need to go to the doctor.  I'll be alright."  Three weeks later and hes acting like hes on deaths door.  Thankfully, he finally went to the doctor on Saturday.  Sex has been minimal.  Have you noticed from my posts?  lol  Mostly remininscing.  Its not his fault if hes hurt, but gee whiz, get it fixed and lets move on!   I know all about back pain.  I hurt my back at work when I was 16 and have had problems with it ever since.  Then when I was pregnant, I had the joys of a fetus sitting on my sciatic nerve, bringing me mind numbing constant pain that nothing could help.  I just had to wait for my precious baby to move his little hiney off my poor nerve.  I know back pain sucks, but he could have been better by now.  Laying and sitting both hurt him, and every time I try to nuzzle up to him I hear, "My back!"  Finally the other night, after fooling around only to hear, "Ow!  My back!", I took charge.   "Stand up."  "What?" he asked, confused.  "Stand up.  Now."  He ever so slowly gets out of bed like an old man, belly aching the whole time.  Once hes standing, I scoot to the edge of the bed and pull down his shorts, freeing his dick and quickly taking it in my mouth.  "Oh!" he gasps, thrusting himself deep in my throat, nearly gagging me.  I cup his balls with my hand as he slips in and out of my mouth.   "Hows your back?", I ask him.  "Fine.  It doesn't hurt when I stand."  Hearing this I reply, "Good.  Then you can stand up and fuck me from behind."  I turn around on my hands and knees presenting my ass and pussy to him.  He licks a finger to wet me, but I'm already moist.  Very slowly he starts to insert himself, which I met by bucking up against him, forcing his full length deep inside me.  "Oh fuck!" I moan, as my body meets his thrusts, my ass slapping against his pelvis.  I feel his hand rest on the small of my back, pulling me onto him.   "Oh yeah!  Fuck me!  Mmmmmm....  Fuck my pussy!"  Drunk on the pleasure, I feel myself melting into the bed as my walls begin to squeeze around his cock, coaxing him to come.  And he does.  Feeling refreshed and alive, I ask him, "There.  Now how do you feel?"  "Fine." He answers.  "But my back still hurts."

      Last night, after reading a medical post, I was reminded of scrubs. lol Bear with me, I'm sharing my thought process here. Well, thinking of scrubs reminded me of my stethoscope that was so tragically ruined a few weeks ago. Thinking of my stethoscope, of course made me think of the cat who ruined it, which then reminded me that I need to clip his nails. I hate clipping cat nails. This thought brought me my veterinary technician days. ( this sounds strangely like, 'If you give a mouse a cookie'....)  Thinking of my vet tech days ,  reminded me of this:  Earlier in the day, we had gotten a call about a lost dog. She was a cocker spaniel who had gotten out of her backyard when the kids left the gate open. The owner was calling around leaving a description and their name and number, should anyone call to report finding their dig. I think her name was Cassie. Anyway, this was common, so we wrote down the information and put it up on the board, forgetting about it as we prepared for surgery.  A few hours later, just as the last surgical patient was placed in its cage, the phone rang. I heard the receptionist answer the phone, and heard her getting directions from someone and asking if they thought the dog was still alive. Upon hanging up, she rushed over to tell us that a dog had been hit by a car and the person who called thinks its still alive. It was a cocker spaniel.  Janelle grabbed the stretcher, yes there are stretchers for animals, and I ran with her to her van. I had a feeling that we would be too late, but Janelle was hopeful and sped to the scene. We saw the body right away, laying on the side of the road, cars zooming past it, choosing not to look or be bothered by it. As we pulled up behind it, I saw its front paw move.  "Quick! Shes still moving!", I spit out as I scramble out of the vehicle running up to the dog. Upon reaching the poor thing, I saw that her skull was crushed. There was no way that she was going to make it. She wasn't breathing, and her tongue was already bluish, her gums pale and tacky. Janelle saw the severity of the injuries and we shared a disappointing look. She placed the stretcher on the ground and we carefully placed the body upon it before heading back to the van.  When we got back to the clinic, the doctors were waiting for us outside. I shook my head at them, signaling to them that it was too late. We brought the dog in and took special care in cleaning up the blood with hydrogen peroxide, making it presentable, should the owner come by to claim it. She had no collar on, but matched the description of the lost cocker spaniel from earlier in the day. Janelle called the owner with the news that perhaps their dog had been hit by a car and asked if they would like to come take a look to verify whether or not it was Cassie. The owner was very adamant that it couldn't possibly be his dog. We found her too far away from home, she wouldn't play in traffic, plus she didn't have a collar on. His dog always wears a collar. He agreed to come by after work though.  Me and Janelle were the only ones left at the clinic when he finally got there. We were just about to close when he walked through the doors.  "Hi. I called about our cocker spaniel...." His sentence trailed off, as I signaled to him that I knew who he was and asked him to follow me to an exam room while we got the body. He was very tall, probably 6'3" or taller. He ran his fingers through his blonde/brown hair as he added, "I know its not Cassie. She always has a collar on. It just couldn't be her. I feel bad for whos ever dog you found though." His blue eyes darted around the exam room nervously. He acted confident that we didn't have his dog, but the fear and anxiety was palpable in the small room. He held his suit jacket in his arms, fidgeting with it as I heard Janelle tap on the door.  I opened the door and helped her carry the dog in, placing it on the table for him to inspect. Janelle quickly left the room, afraid to hear the truth.  "No."  "No?" I ask.  He drops his jacket. "No, no, no, no,no!" He reaches out to touch the dog then stops, looking at me as if to ask if its okay. I nod. He barely touches her fur before hes reduced to tears. Its Cassie.  I reach over rubbing my hand against his arm, trying to console him in some way. He plops down on his knees, his body collapsing against mine shaking with his sobs. The weight of his body, nearly pushing me over, I too get on my knees to help support his body against me. His head rests on my chest and I can feel a stream of tears falling between my breasts.  I feel helpless and overwhelmed with a desire to make him feel better. I just held him while he cried. I wanted to kiss the top of his head and tell him everything would be okay, but I just listened to him cry and rubbed his back. He was so exposed, so raw before me. If I thought that sex would have erased his sorrow, I would have eagerly agreed to take part.  I felt sleazy at that thought. Thinking of sex at such an inopportune time. But I felt connected to him. Like, if ever there were a time to have sex with a stranger, and at the same time do a good deed, then this would be a perfect example.  Of course, that didn't happen. He collected himself and apologized before we discussed arrangements for Cassie. One last goodbye to his baby, a hand shake turned hug for me and he was gone.

       urlLink    I had a dream this morning that I was alone in our backyard.  I hadn't had sex in over a year, and I hadn't masturbated in that year either.  It was warm outside, and looked to be spring, with all the flowers in bloom.  Sitting in the grass, smelling the flowers, I found my hand drifting up my leg.  I knew what I wanted to do, but for whatever reason, I felt guilty about doing it.  Finally, I threw all caution to the wind, pulled off my dress, leaving me naked and began rubbing myself.  My fingers seemed to be releasing electrical currents to my pussy, nearly painful, but I couldn't stop.  I had to come.  I felt a pain in my belly, a tight achey knot of an orgasm waiting to be released.  It was uncomfortable, but I knew it would vanish as soon as I climaxed, which encouraged to fingers to work even faster.  I felt the knot loosen, allowing the waves of ecstasy to erase the pent up tension.  I woke up having the most forceful, contracting orgasm that I have ever had in my entire life.  I could still faintly feel the ache in my belly, almost like a sore muscle, relaxing as my pussy pulsed.  The unexpected intensity left me gasping as I rode out the sensations, leaving me breathless and stunned at the same time.  I wake up in the middle of an orgasm more frequently than you would think, probably 3 or 4 times a month, always alone, after Rick has left for work and after an erotic dream.  What a wonderful way to start the day!&nbsp; urlLink

      Look at me!  I've been sent an urban legend/scam!  I feel so special.   To:    Subject:  Business Partnership Required Attn: The President/CEO I am Mr. David Tungay, Provincial Director Standard Bank of South Africa, Johannesburg Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On June 6, 2000, a foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Richard Moss made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr.Richard Moss died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Moss did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South Africa Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Richard Moss so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.Awaiting your urgent reply via my email:davidtungay4@zwallet.com Thanks and regards. Mr.David Tungay.  That money would buy a lot of margaritas and Wiggles tickets.  What a cruel joke.

      I'm surprised at the number of people using my site as an example of 'what not to do'. lol Some jokingly, probably the ones who are embarrassed to talk about sex. And others just appalled that I write what I do in good conscious.  Whats so funny about the last group, is that I usually get the most hits from their reference of me. lol Whoops! No one is tying you up in your chair, forcing you to click over to my site. (if they are, then you probably enjoy it!;0) So, the easy solution is to stop coming here. You won't all of a sudden find me posting about church sermons or casserole recipes, so stop looking! But feel free to continue using me as an example. Your stuffy friends rather like me.    I've been blog whoring, and have found some good sites. lol What, you may ask, is blog whoring? Well let me tell you! hee hee When I first started this blog, and had no one commenting, I decided to cruise the recently updated blog list, *hoping* to find an audience, or at least an audience who would talk back to me! lol I found quite a few blogs that way.  urlLink Blogging like I never blogged before ,  urlLink Road to Pregnancy ,  urlLink Rantings of an Internet Salesman ,  urlLink Blogging Without A Net ,  urlLink A Fool For Women ,  urlLink Hex, Fries and VideoScotchtape . Is your name on my list? lol Are you surprised that I found you by blog whoring? Its a dirty job...    Anyway, in the last few days, I've found some more blogs worthy of note, and that will find a home in my side bar hopefully soon. Are you surprised by the blogs I read? Not a lot of kink in there, is there? Mostly funny blogs, actually. Maybe I just want you to come here for the kink...lol No, there are some good sex blogs up there. I just didn't find them through blog whoring. We met through a Sex Addicts Anonymous meeting. lol I kid.   And now the new blogs:   urlLink My dark little corner of cyberspace ~ A day in the life account of a real life hero, a fireman. He is a doll, and you must go read his site. Everyone needs to understand what these men and women go through.    urlLink A Butterless Man ~ Ahhhh... Professor Mel!  I just simply adore his writing and the intellect that shines through his posts.  His metaphoric writing is poetry in motion, causing the reader to lose their sense of place and time as they are pulled into his world through his words.  A must read.   *Edited for Professor Mel's pleasure*    urlLink Intermediate Animal Cracker Survey ~ Oh my goodness, this site! lol Run by Tralfie, I am stunned that more people aren't flocking to his site. Hes very funny, easily comprable to the bigger funny sites, and yet no signs of his visitors. His comments and tracker must be broken. That must be it.    urlLink The Incredible Journal of a Weird Dude ~ This is another web surfing site, kinda like Rich's. Its run by Rolando, and has funny pics, clips and jokes. Very entertaining, and hes a sweetheart.    I hope I haven't forgotten anybody.    One more note, yesterday's story was not the planned Hump Day submission. That has been delayed to next Wednesday so I can add the  urlLink new lead character , remember? lol I've gotten more emails about that. Its coming, and it will be good. ;0)

      At least for August in the midwest anyway.  We're typically near 100 degrees with humidity so high, you get drenched just walking out the door.  Today, as I sit near an open window typing this, the chilly breeze is giving me goose bumps.  Its freaky!  The lows over night are in the 50's.  This is not August weather.  Something must be terribly wrong...

      We had only met a month ago when we bumped into each other outside of the bookstore at the university. I was walking one way and looking another when I slammed into a solid wall of chest. I had to look up with my head tilted up high to see his face. Tall, at least 6'3, tan, with one of those crooked sideways grins that always makes me blush to my toes. Dark brown hair cut short and tousled with dark serious green eyes. He laughed outsold when he looked down at my stunned face. No doubt my mouth was gaping open and my blue eyes were staring rudely. That's how I met Jake. It was an instant attraction that we courted with through sly remarks and brief touches. We became friends, and now here I am inside my grandmother's attic sorting boxes on Easter weekend with this incredibly attractive guy. He has a great sense of humor, and a great charm about him. When I told him I had to go home to help close my grandmother's house, he volunteered to help. Excited about keeping him to myself for the long weekend I agreed to let him come with me.We decided to stay in my grandmother's house along with my brother and cousin, so we could be away from the "adults." Being 21 is an odd place to be growing up. The weekend was going well. Saturday found Jake and I alone in the attic, sorting through boxes. He was enjoying male bonding with our temporary housemates who had decided to make a mid day run to the liquor store. I had taken some garbage out to the street and left Jake looking through old clothes."Hey, come look at this," he called out when I walked back into the kitchen. I stared up the ladder listening to him shifting through boxes. He stuck his head out from a box and smiled down at me. It was hot and he had taken off his shirt. I could see just the hint of his smooth dark chest from over the boxes. Brown nipples just barely noticeable. "Wait, on second thought," he disappeared back behind the boxes. Leaving me trying to picture in my mind what the rest of his chest looked like.I could hear bells and more things falling on the floor. A few curse words, a loud thud, then, "okay! Come here."I climb up into the attic to see him holding up a large life size wooden Mrs. Clause. He's smiling widely; tan well built arms on either side. I love his arms, lined with ropy muscles, not real big but full of force. I laugh at his excitement more than the cutout that had graced our lawn when I was a child. "I found this Christmas stuff, isn't it great?" he was dancing the cutout around. "But wait!" he sat the Claus down and hid behind it. A ring of a bell, and he jumped out wearing a Santa suit. Well sort of a Santa suit. He had on the black boots and red wool pants with the white cuffs. They were way too big, but were being held up by a pair of green shiny suspenders. He couldn't find the jacket, only the pants and the hat that he proudly wore. The hat had the white beard attached to it that he was wearing tucked under his chin. He held out his arms, "What do you think?"I smiled. I think I had never seen anything as sexy in my life. I don't know if it was the heat from the attic, our on going sexual attention, or some strange connection to that suit that I wasn't aware existed until that moment. Whatever it was, I couldn't take my eyes off of those suspenders and what they were holding those pants over. He sat down on some boxes and planted his knees apart. Smiling he patted his leg, "Come here."I walked up to him, fingering the fuzzy ball at the end of the cap. He placed both hands on my waist and pulled me between his legs, "Sit down and tell me if you've been a good girl."I sat down on his leg, putting my hands behind his neck. The furry material of his pants feeling good on the backs of my thighs from my short cutoffs. I couldn't help but move my rear back and forth a few times to feel the material just below the cheeks of my ass."I've been very good this year," I blushed, feeling silly for playing this game, but strangely turned on. "Very good?" Jake raised an eyebrow at me. He had one hand around my waist, his thumb slipping under my tank top and stroking my side. His other hand had found my knee. "Are you sure?"I studied his face for a few minutes, then looked down. There was a tent developing in the loose pants. I felt my hair clip being pulled out, letting my hair fall down over my back. "Yes sir, very good. Shouldn't the Easter bunny be asking me this?""Well, he's not feeling so well I'm afraid," Jake picked up a stuffed bunny and threw it over his shoulder. "He asked me to step in and do a check up for him on all the good and bad girls.""What about the boys?" I asked when his hand began to move up the inside of my knee."Who's the Santa here? I check on who I want at Easter. This is my chance to let good little girls be bad, and teach bad little girls how to be good."I opened my legs slightly, letting his hand slide up my thigh, his other hand brushing against my bra. "I see," I bit my bottom lip to keep from letting out a moan. I could feel my panties starting to get wet; I couldn’t seem to sit still. "H-have I been good?" Jake's hand slid up into the edge of my shorts, his fingers moving over the lace of my panties. "Too good."I stopped his hand, and stood up between his legs, "Too good, what does that mean?"Jake pulled me to him, his legs holding me on either side, his face almost pressed into the cleavage of my large breasts. "It means," he pressed his lips down into my shirt nuzzling between my breasts through the cloth, "that you need some lessons on how to be a little more bad." His hands followed his mouth, grabbing as much of my chest as they could and squeezing my breasts together. We had not been so interment before, but something about our impromptu role-play was turning me on; I wanted to let him touch me. I wanted to know what he thought was bad behavior. I could feel his cock growing harder through his pants on my thigh. “What do you want me to do Santa?”He reached behind his back and brought out an angel costume that I had worn in the 2nd grade. It was a little sparkly choir robe with lace on the bottom. “Put this on.” He reached back again and brought out a pair of my aunt’s ballroom dancing shoes. Tall high stiletto heels. I slipped behind some boxes and put on this impromptu outfit. The child’s robe was far too small for me now. The hem only reached to the very top of my thighs, and my chest was too big to zip it all the way up. The heels were a way higher than I ever wore. My calves were stretched tight from my foot being arched so high. I decided to leave on my white lace bikinis and bra.I stepped out from behind the boxes. The attic door had been shut. Jake sat on the boxes again smiling at me. His eyes going from my long legs in the heels to resting on my breasts stretching the material impossibly tight on the child’s robe. “Come here.”He pulled me between his legs and told me to turn around for him to see. He turned me around fast facing away from him. I could see our reflections in an old mirror he had set up. There was a halo on the floor with a pair of wings. “Bend over and pick those up,” he told me. I watched him take the suspenders off his shoulders. I bent down real slow, letting the robe ride up over my rear, showing the lace panties, The heels making me bend further than usual. Through the mirror I watched his eyes staring at my tight ass, his hand inside his pants moving slowly. “Put them on,” his eyes met mine in the mirror, “and come kneel down.I did as I was told, putting the wings over my arms, looking very small on my adult body. The halo was just a gold circle that stood up on a pipe cleaner and headband. I knelt down between his knees; his jaw was clenched tight trying to control his movements. I smiled up at him enjoying knowing it was me that was causing this loss of control.“Now, I have a nice treat for you,” he rubbed my cheek with his hand, then wrapped his hands into my hair at the back of my neck. “There’s a nice candy cane here, I want you to show me how you eat a candy cane.” I watched the loose pants bulge and move with the hard cock it covered. I took my hands and slowly undid the ties of the pants, freeing them from his hips. His cock sprang free. It was a lot larger than I thought, at least 9 inches and thicker than I had ever seen. The head of it was standing out with a small bead of precum just beginning to form. I stared at it for a moment until I felt a tug on my hair. “What does a good girl say when she gets candy?”“Thank you, Santa,” I replied, not sure where to begin with this new prize. I slowly slipped my tongue out catching the precum on my tongue. Opening my mouth more, I let the head slide in slowly, adjusting to the size. I can hear Jake groan. His hips move to thrust out more to my face. Both of his hands lock into my hair and pull my head down onto his cock. The end slides way down into my throat, making me almost gag. His hips are moving up and down meeting his hands pulling my hair. He is fucking my face hard, using my own hair to force me up and down on him. Suddenly he let’s go and I pull up to catch a big breath of air. “Oh no, you’re not through, keep going like that.”I take him into my mouth again, this time moving my head up and down at the same speed his hands had shown me. My hand moving to wrap around the base of his cock and move with my mouth. I can hear him letting out low growls in his throat. One hand finds my hair again and knots it around his fist. He starts pumping my head with his hand telling me how good I am at sucking his cock. I move my tongue over his head back and forth, flicking at the mushroom tip before taking him deep into my throat again. My hands massaging his inner thighs and teasing his balls. Reaching down, he pulls the zipper down making my breasts push out of the robe in their bra. Pulling my hair back hard he growls, “take it off.” I open the bra, letting my breasts fall out, hanging out of the robe. His hands grab a nipple in each hand squeezing and pulling. He squeezes my chest together and pulls me back onto his crotch. His cock, wet from my mouth slides in between my breasts. The head peeking up at me through my cleavage. I lean down and flick my tongue out on the head when it peeks through. He twists my nipples hard, causing me to cry out. “I didn’t tell you to start licking,” he said, pulling me up by my chest. He bent me over his knee still clad in the Santa pants. I can feel the robe going up over my ass as I am bent over one leg, my hair on the floor and my face swinging almost between my own ankles and his leg. I can feel my panties being pulled down and a hand falling sharp onto my ass. A loud thwack is heard through the attic, “you’ve been a bad girl,” he smacks his hand down three more times making my ass sting. Then holding me still over his knee, I can feel his fingers sliding along the crack of my ass. His fingers spread my cheeks and slide along inside. Moving down they move into my wet pussy. I can feel his fingers spreading my wet juices to my ass, “hmm you’re been a very bad girl.”He pulls me back standing up facing away from him. Pulling my legs apart he pulls me back onto his lap. I can feel his cock pressing against my ass. His hands pulling my thighs open wide, his fingers pulling at the folds of my wet pussy. His cock slides in against my wetness. Suddenly he pulls me off balance and hard onto his cock. He holds me there, sitting with his cock deep inside my pussy, we look like a very naught Christmas card through the mirror. The little wings and robe are still on my body but my breasts are hanging out and my legs are being spread wide over his own legs. With his legs, he opens and closes them making me fall up and down on his cock. His hands grab my breasts to hold me to his chest as we fuck harder. I can feel every inch of him moving in and out. My head falls back on his shoulder and I gasp for air each time he forces me down hard on his cock. His nails are digging into my breasts making me more and more excited. My toes barely reach the floor on either side of his leg as he makes me ride him over and over. He bites on my ear lobe telling me to finger myself as he fucks me. I lean back swiftly putting my hand where he asks and rubbing my clit in time with his thrusting. I’m building up a strong climax when suddenly he stops and pulls me off of him. Standing up, he bends my body at the waist telling me to hold my ankles. He leans down and bites each of my ass cheeks hard. I let out a loud cry when I feel the sting of his teeth. His fingers find my wet hole and start to finger me fast. Suddenly, he stands and pulls me hard onto him. I can feel his cock ramming into my pussy. Bent over, it feels twice as large as it was before. I try to cry out but it gets caught in my throat. Grabbing my ass he begins to fuck me harder than before. My head is bobbing up and down a few inches off the floor. The halo falls down and the little robe and wings are around my arms and headLeaning down he pulls my hair, making my head come up. I am nose to nose with the mirror. I can see him standing behind me with the hat still on and the pants at his ankles. He is fucking me so hard that the vein in his neck is starting to stick out. I can’t believe the dirty slut in the mirror is me. I am loving it. He pulls me up until his hand moves down to pinch my clit between his fingers. I cry out hard, moving my hips with his thrusts. His hands tighten on my thighs and his thrusts become deeper, longer, slower lunges. We cum together falling onto the floor with the discarded Christmas ornaments and boxes of old clothes. Catching my breath, I roll out from under him, leaning against the mirror. I look down at his face. He’s smiling that same sideways grin at me, the Santa hat is still looped around his neck via the beard. I smile. I can’t wait until the holidays.

      Unfortunatly, my Hump Day submission will be a bit late this week.  I'm finding I have to change the original character I had intended to use, which kinda throws everything else off.  So heres the thing, I need a new male lead, a blogger who doesn't mind the harmless fun of being included in a little Hump Day story.  If you are interested, email me at  urlLink good_wife00@excite.com  .  I'll need the name of your blog, a brief description of the basics (hair eyes, etc), and a name to use.  Your real name is fine, or your blog alias, or just a name you want me to use.  Email me by Saturday, the 14, to give me time to complete the story by next Wednesday.

      Three actually, but whos counting? lol  No, of course nothing sexual.  But now I know what they feel like, should I wish to fantasize...lol  I told myself today not to talk like this about the poor Wiggles anymore.  I probably would be creeped out if I read a blog where someone had an obsession or crush on some sort of children's entertainers.   Our son was in total awe! lol  Hes two, and was just shrieking in delight at being so close to his favorite characters.  They put on an excellent show, with Captain Feathersword doing Prince, Bob Dylan, Ozzie Osbourne, Mick Jagger and Elvis impersonations.  They rocked out to some 'Stairway to Heaven' on the air guitars, and all four plus Captain spoke to our son at some point.  He was in stimulation overload!  lol   So an anonymous reader went so far as to go to the  urlLink Wiggles Official Web Site  to find out where we were, huh? lol  I'm impressed.   WT, the picture I posted today is from  urlLink Garv .  Most of my stuff I've collected over time and just have sitting around in my files, so I like to dust them off and share.  I'm glad you like them, and thank you for the compliment, love.  You guys should be free of any Wiggle posting until this time next year.  lol  But then, be afraid! ;0)

      Someone just posted this anonymous comment that has left me scratching my head:     At  7:10 PM , Anonymous said… Yea the picture is there. Seems to me like you are a good writer and trying to get a book or article published. Some people go for the "great story" that isn't real. Some think you are male....      I am flattered at the compliment, don't get me wrong!  Thank you, thank you!  It means a lot to me to have someone compliment my writing.  Now tell me this anonymous, are you telling me you think I'm a guy?  Or that others think I'm a guy?  The second to last statement is odd too, as it could be taken so many different ways, simply by adding a comma or by placing emphasis on certain words.   I appreciate the compliment.  Now please help me understand the rest!  If anybody has any guesses, I'm all ears!

      Don't buy an ice shaver.  And if you get one for a gift, exchange it, or re-gift it, especially if you enjoy slushy mixed drinks like...oh, say margaritas.  Its barely after noon, and I'm happily sipping a strawberry margarita as I type this.  Damn ice shaver.  Enjoying this fruity, tequila heavy concoction makes me wish I were laying out on the beach.  Listening to the sounds of the waves crashing and the seagulls squawking as the sun beats down lovingly on my bronzed skin.   I frown as I notice the end of my drink coming near.  The beach is empty, except for the approaching cabana boy, carrying a tray with a drink replacement, tanning oil and some fresh fruit.  "Buenos dias, senorita," he greets me.  I smile, removing my sunglasses and taking in the lovely view of the man in front of me.  "Gracias," I say as he hands me the glass, taking away the empty one.  "That fruit looks delicious."  "Oh it is.  Fresh picked and practically bursting with its sweet nector."  He picks up a very large strawberry and then asks, "May I?"  I lick my lips as he brings the fruit to my mouth.  Upon biting the sweet berry, its juices seem to explode, trickling down my chin.  My hand raises to catch the drips, but he stops me.   "May I?", he asks as he comes in closely to me, stopping just before he touches me, awaiting my approval.  I manage to nod and then feel his warm mouth on my neck, his tongue erasing the sugar trail that the berry left.   Just as quickly he stands up.  "Will you be needing anything else, senorita?"  He sees me eying the tanning oil.  "Perhaps I may refresh you?" he asks, holding the bottle.  I nod.  Setting the tray down once more, he opens the container, releasing the coconut fragrance.  A quick squirt into the palm of his hands and then he begins massaging the oil into my skin, starting at my feet and working up my legs.  At the top of my inner thigh, I feel his fingers brush up against the fabric of my bikini, sending sparks through out my body.  I long for him to touch me there, to feel his body against mine, and then inside of me....  He comes to my chest and stops.  I decide to take off my top and sunbathe topless.  He smiles, admiring my exposed breasts.  "May I?", he asks, as he gets another dab of oil in his hands.  I nod, and then feel his strong hands, kneading the wetness into my breasts.  My nipples are hard as he massages over them, taking his time.   Too soon, he is finished.  "Will that be all, senorita?"  I could have sent him off, imagining what might have been.  But instead, I reach up, holding on to his belt and ask him, "May I?", as I begin to unbuckle him.  My request is met with a smile and a nod......  Damn ice shaver!  See what a bad influence it is to me?

      Okay, I promise I won't ask this again, but please tell me, do you see my sidebar correctly, with the profile pic and links at the top of the page?  If so, then why is it always at the bottom of the page for me?  I'm wondering if I didn't screw something up messing with the template the other day.  Thank you in advance for once again helping the computer challenged wife! ;0)  Oh, and how funny that the blogger ads are now advertising Yankees tickets at the top of my blog.  I guess Blogger is attempting a joke.  Ha ha ha.  Very funny.  How about advertising the Cardinals!!!???  (don't be upset if you're a Yankees fan, we all make mistakes.  lol)  I kid, I kid!!

      The weekends are always filled with errands and obligatory outings with friends and family to keep up our social standings.  Blah.  I would have been happy to stay in bed all day today.  We made my favorite drink last night, strawberry margaritas, and I drank waaaaay too many.  I have a soft spot in my heart for tequila. lol  Must be my mexican blood.  Anyway, I had the best night of sleep last night, filled with pleasant dreams and extremely restful sleep.  If I didn't know better, I could easily become an alcoholic, purely for the magnificent slumber benefits.  The buzz would just be an added bonus. lol   We went out with Denise and Dave today, for lunch followed by a movie.  (we saw Anchorman, which was hilarious, a must see)  By the end of the day, between the brushing up against me, a slight butt touching 'accident', and the erie undressing me with his eyes looks from Dave, I felt like I needed a cigarette to cap off.  I almost said something, but refrained myself.  I understand that hes frustrated with Denise, but next time I'm made to feel like a piece of meat in the eyes of a hungry dog, I'll be sure and let my feelings known.  For Dave's sake, I hope that doesn't happen.  I finally saw the Charlie Brown clip, I so desperatly wanted to see.   It lived up to my expectations~it was great! lol  But then, I love the Peanuts gang, and I adore the song, so it was meant to be.   GO CARDINALS!!  We are really kicking some ass this year!  Its rather exciting.  I'm not big into sports, but who doesn't get excited when the home team is winning?  Did you see the crowd cheer Larry Walker when he stepped out to bat for the first time?  They gave him a standing ovation.  And then, get this, when the man struck out, they again cheered for him.  Wow.  This is why St Louis is the place to be for team sports.  We had a clean sweep with the Mets.  I like the Mets, only because I hate the Yankees. lol  Which, really, I only hated the Yankees because of psycho path Roger Clemens.  Gawd, I can't stand that man.  I guess now I have to hate the Cubs, since thats where hes at now.  But, me saying I hate a team , doesn't mean anything to anybody so...anywho... lol  Two things I learned about baseball that I hate.  (Rick has been watching the games every night, which is why I even know anything about it.)  One, bunting the ball.  That is weak.  A cop out.  Stupid.  Just plain irritating.  "Its just a part of the game, baby."  Its still stupid.  Two, intentional walks, where they step to the side and don't even attempt to throw real pitches.  Are you kidding me?  What kind of pussy ass cop out is that?  Thats just ridiculous.   I am off to instigate some sex. ;0)  Hope everyone had a wonderful weekend!

       urlLink    I realized on Friday that Hans bears a striking resemblence to Rhasaan Orange from Days of Our Lives.  The main difference in appearance would be the hair.  Hans' hair is straight and a little longer compared to Rhasaan's.  They do look remarkably similar though.  Now can you blame me for fantasizing? Didn't think so.  ;0)&nbsp; urlLink

      Boy howdy, do I get some interesting fan mail from you guys!  Most common of them all being wedding proposals.  Ummm...How do I say this nicely?  I'm taken.  Notice that I am The Good   WIFE  .  You see, I already have a husband.  I call him Rick on this blog.  I think I may have mentioned him once or twice.  Sorry.  But thanks?  Today I got an email worthy of sharing.  Its odd to say the least, as it has to do with a fetish.  Not a normal fetish.  (Is there such a thing?)  Anyway, read on:   Hi Wife,      May I call you that?  Or maybe you would like to email me you real name, so that we may address each other respectfully.  Its rude not sharing your name with your fans.  I'm a big fan.  ;-}  You have something I want, and I am willing to pay you for it.  I can tell by you body dat you probly eat well, sesibly.  That makes for yummy prizes that is what i want from you.  I would like to send you a container in a well sealed box for you to deposit sum urine in for me to have.  You think its wierd?  But its not.  Its good for you, and pretty girls make the best.  How much do you charge?  I will pay most anything for urine of yours.  I can almost smell it now.  Here is my phone number and adress and you can give me your address to send you the box. ok?        Love you alot!!!! ;-}      Melvin      That is a real email, I kid you not.  By asking how much I charge, he implies I've spoken of selling my urine before.  I'm pretty sure I haven't.  Melvin, baby, you are creepy.  Blech.  "No pee for you!"  (imagine me saying that like the soup nazi from Seinfeld.  funny, right?lol)  So, be forewarned, if you send creepy email, you may just get publicly embarrased.  Or excited, depending on your fetish, I suppose.  Just don't do it!  Oh, and Melvin?  Yeah, I won't be sharing my real name either.  Sorry about that, bud.  But if anyone is in the market for selling their pee, I know just the guy to call!

I plan to share my Hump Day Erotica, probably posting them all to date, and then adding the new ones, perhaps with some exclusive to that site.  Anyone interested in writing is welcome to leave comments, taking on the writing challenges or even leaving feed back for whats written.  And of course, I hope you will go there to read my work as well! =0)  I'll probably start adding tomorrow, so keep your eyes open.

      It was a gorgeous day today, sunny and breezy with a high of only near 80.  Thats just unbelievable for August in the midwest.  Of course I decided to take advantage of the beautiful weather, and went out to tan.  I was in the middle of a sun induced coma, muscles numb and relaxed from my daily sun therapy, when I suddenly noticed I had company.  It was Santa Claus.  lol  Our neighbor bears an uncanny resemblence to jolly 'ol St Nick, and has the nicknames of Nick and Santa to show for it.  Hes in his sixties, white hair and beard, pale skin with rosy cheeks, and of course the plumpness of any good Santa look alike.  He had let himself through our gate and into our backyard and was walking towards me when I noticed him.  He had on an open button up shirt, showing off his big hairy 'shake like a bowl full of jelly' belly.  He was even less sexy than you can possibly imagine. lol  I took off my headphones, curious to know why he felt the need to barge into our yard.   "You look hot."  Did Santa Claus just tell me I looked hot?  I bet I get some awesome presents this year!  "Excuse me?"  "You look hot, honey.  Warm.  Overheated."  Maybe I won't have such a kick ass Christmas after all.  "I'm fine.  Its only 80 degrees out today, Nick."  I saw he was holding a glass of iced tea.  "I brought you a drink.  Its easy to get dehydrated in this sort of heat."  I guess hes still used to living at the North Pole, because, as I said it was only 80 and there was a pleasant breeze.  "I'm fine, hon.  And I have a bottle of water right here", I said picking up the bottle of water and showing it to him.  "But its not fresh mad ice tea, now is it?"  That it was not.  He handed me the tea, and suddenly I had this image in my head of Santa spiking the iced tea with some kind of date rape drug or something awful and perverted.  I stared at the tea, expecting to see remnants of a crushed up pill floating around in it.  Isn't that awful?  But his shirt was unbuttoned!  And I was barely dressed and here he was in my back yard after obviously noticing me lying out, even though hes not even the next door neighbor.   "Thanks, Nick."  I set the tea down.  "Well aren't you gonna drink it?"  Aha!  It must be drugged!  Bad Santa!  Bad!  "Of course I will, thank you for thinking of me.  Did you need something else?"  He seemed to hunt for some other reason to stick around, but came up with nothing.  "No, I just didn't want you to get overheated.  You, know laying in the sun is bad for you.  You should lay in the shade."  "I know.  I'll take my chances in the sun though."  "If you like the tea, I've always got plenty more."  "Thanks Nick."  And I put the headphones back on as he finally left.  That sounds mean, doesn't it?  lol  But then wouldn't you feel bad if he really did drug me?  I didn't drink the tea, my paranoia got the best of me.  I have a feeling he'll bring me more though.  Damn Santa. lol

      I was having a conversation with Denise, a very close friend of mine last night.  She is a very...dominant person.  Her husband, Dave, is submissive to a point where he appears scared to death of her at times.  There is only way of doing things, and that is Denise's way.   Anyway, Denise is currently six months pregnant.  They had problems conceiving, due to ovarian cysts among other things.  In describing their rocky road to pregnancy, she related a story to me, of when Dave had to give a sperm sample, checking his status of fertility.  "It was disgusting!  They didn't have a special room or anything, so he had to use a bathroom and it wasn't working.  Eventually I had to...  *whispering* go in and ....ahem...help him ."  I was amused that she found it necessary to whisper.  By the expression on her face, you would have guessed she was describing the most vile, disgusting thing she had ever witnessed.  Perhaps in her opinion she was.   "I couldn't even look at him while I was doing it.  It was so...gross.  I told him, 'Now you better make sure you can catch it all in the cup.  Don't you dare spill it or get any on me!'  We were in there forever!  I thought he was never going to....you know."  I can't believe he wasn't bursting with excitement, what with all her kind encouraging words.  "I told him that I would  never  be doing  that  again."  His test showed nothing of concern, Denise was put on fertility drugs, and they quickly became pregnant soon after.  Yesterday she confided this, "Me and Dave haven't had... *whispering* sex  since I got pregnant.  * laughing*   I don't care though, I got what I want! * laughing* "   I was surprised, but not shocked at what she said.  I know she had had terrible morning sickness for the first three months.  But that ended three months ago.  Was sex to her only for conception?  Surely Dave must be...well, horny as hell.  Is he really so scared of her, that he is afraid to ask for what is rightfully his?  Perplexing.  Maybe I was just lucky, or maybe I truly am a nympho, but my sex life never slowed when I was pregnant.  If anything, it picked up, with rather high intensity.  Yes, I was slightly nauseous in the beginning, but only ever got sick twice throughout my entire nine months.  I took very well to being pregnant, and seemed to crave sex more than ever, coming more easily and with heightened intensity.  Rick and I were both working overnight at the time and would often have sex before going to bed in the morning  and again upon waking in the afternoon or evening.  There was no fear of an unintended pregnancy, so Rick always came inside of me, which of course was more pleasurable to both of us.  Once I went on maternity leave, Rick would come home during his lunch hour while I was blissfully sleeping.  I would be awakened by him licking my pussy before he inserted his dick.  A quick hard fuck and a kiss goodbye.  This happened nearly daily, and led to pleasant dreams afterwards.  Once the baby was born, literally hours later, I was desperatly horny.  I knew that sex, the way we knew it, was weeks away.  6 weeks, to be exact, time for the episiotomy to heal and for things to go back to normal.  Every book I read, everyone's friendly unsolicited advice, told me that I would not miss the sex.  That I would appreciate the break on top of not having time to even think of such things.  "Don't worry, you won't have time to miss sex with a new baby!"  They were wrong.  There was nothing wrong with me.  I loved my baby more than anything I had previously known.  But I missed the closeness that sex brought between my husband and me.   Our first night home from the hospital, as the baby slept blissfully in the bassinet, I gave Rick a blowjob.  He acted shocked, surely expecting a sexless nun of a wife for the next month and a half.  I couldn't help it.  I had to feel the closeness.  I didn't masturbate, or have sex until I was released from my doctor, but I gave Rick regular oral sex, knowing that if for whatever reason he were to be out of comission for any amount of time, that he would do the same for me.  Normally, if I'm turned on enough, I can come just by him playing with my breasts, licking and nibbling the nipples as he kneads the meaty flesh.  Breastfeeding took that away, but I was still content with our arrangement.  Sex is part of what makes me feel like a woman, and there is no reason that anything should take that away from me.   That being said, I can't help but wonder what went wrong with Denise and Dave.  I know I'm an exception to the rule, but shouldn't there be some sort of primal urge to fuck her husband?  Why doesn't he just say something?  Its been six months!  I don't think Rick and I would be as close as we are, if we didn't regularly make love.  At this rate, they won't be having sex  until Denise decides she wants to get pregnant again.  No wonder men get angry and frustrated.  Its unsettling how disturbed she seems to be with all things sexual.  If she had any idea what my sex life was like, I think she would faint.  Dave would appreciate it though. lol

      So all of a sudden, I'm hearing about this hilarious clip of 'Hey Ya' dubbed to a Charlie Brown clip.  The people go on and on about how clever, how funny, how brilliant it is.  Dying of curiosity, I try to download it from the provided links,only to find that all the links are dead.  United, the Charlie Brown people, ordered a cease and desist order to people linking to the clip.  How will I ever live, having never seen said clip? lol  If anybody was quick enough to download it and would like to indulge me, please email me.  I've just got to see this clip.  Thanks, loves!

       urlLink    The sky has suddenly become very dark, threatening rain as the faint sound of thunder grows louder, signaling the storm to come.  You can smell the rain in the air.  The breeze picks up, revealing lightening bolts between the swaying leaves.  The thought of the force and intensity of the storm is exciting, and tends to have me hanging on Rick, wanting to match nature's passion with our own.  Gotta love a summer storm.&nbsp; urlLink

      I thought I might have a Hans story ready for today's submission, but that didn't quite pan out.  Instead, please enjoy this one:  The sun was brightening the room in a haze of white gold. Tamery noticed it when she rolled to her back, her eyelids prickly with the realization that it was full day in the world outside of the bed and breakfast suite. The next thing she noticed was how her hand did not land on the warm firmness of Joshua's thigh when she reached for him. Her eyes fluttered open to find her missing lover.He was sitting at her side watching her wake. His tousled black hair curling in all directions around his perfect smile. Dimples flashing in the right corner of his full soft lips. Sleep still clung to his eyes and he looked as if he had been thoroughly loved. She smiled a contented smile knowing that she was the reason for that sensual expression."Hi," she whispered, stretching like a cat her knee brushing his thigh through the sheet.In reply, he leaned down and kissed her softly on the lips. His tongue dipping slightly to taste her bottom lip before his lips sealed against hers. It was his morning kiss, and she loved those the best. He leaned away from her, and produced a fresh cut single flower. Tamery smiled. The flower was a fresh sunflower, large and bursting with life. It was perfect. Roses were overrated, and Joshua had never been the average type. He was an artist, with artist eyes for details, artist senses for vibrant things, and artist hands for guiding the right lines and stroking the right contours. Those hands were guiding his fresh cut prize across the top of Tamery's chest. The yellow fringe caught the sheet covering her body and began to guide it down exposing her breasts. Her sensitive nipples hardening at the touch of cool air and the familiar tingling began between her thighs as she watched him watching her. The intentness of his stare could make her surrender all defenses. His eyes fixed on his uncovered treasure, she felt warm and loved. He let the brown middle of the flower guide around each nipple; the silken petals of the flower caressing her skin like lover's hands. Tamery arched her chest against the flower, causing the sheet to slide past her navel. She watched him at his game with the sunflower. He smiled at the goosebumps he produced on her skin, and the tight fullness of her erect nipples. Tamery watched the exposed skin of his chest from his open shirt. The tan span of skin that looked copper underneath the white dress shirt winking out at her, the hollowed line in the center of his chest, the little scar above his navel. She reached for the thin white line of it, one finger touching it. Joshua sucked in his breath at the touch, then reached for her hand. He placed the fingers to his lips, kissing and sucking the tips of each one as his other hand guided the flower down lower, to grace her navel, then lower still. Taking her fingers from his mouth, he moved them to the opened button of his jeans. Under her palm, she felt him hardening, throbbing against the jeans making a pulse against her palm. Tamery raised up, circling her arms around her lover's neck and inviting him into a kiss. She sucked on his bottom lip until his mouth opened for hers. Her tongue sliding inside to mate with his and show him the way he was making her feel. Joshua guided her back to the bed, his own body covering hers as they went to the fluffy downs of the bed. He settled between her thighs on his knees as she slipped his shirt from his broad shoulders, throwing it to the side. She reached for his jeans, as he leaned back to retrieve something from the foot of the bed. His cock sprang free of the denim, long and hard as he came back to her with a small basket of strawberries. Joshua moved Tamery's hands from his hips, and held them lightly wrists together over her head. Leaning down, he picked up a berry in his mouth, the bottom part sticking out of his mouth. Smiling at her, berry in his teeth, he made a long line with it's tip from her navel to her neck.The rough texture of the fruit making Tamery's skin tingle. He guided the berry up to her chin then to her waiting mouth. Tamery bit the exposed end of the berry as the kissed, sharing the fruit between them. The sweet freshness of it tingeing her lips before he kissed them clean. She smiled at him and his cleverness. She reached for his face but he held her wrists still. "Ah ah," he smiled, one thick eyebrow raised, "I promised you breakfast in bed, and that you wouldn't have to lift a finger." With that reminder, he dipped down for another berry. Slipping it into his mouth the same way, he moved down to circle her nipples. The texture making her large breasts ache for the softer feeling of his lips, but exciting all the same. Tamery raised her hips, rubbing against the soft denim of his old jeans, teasing the neglected member that she had abandoned before the fruit buffet. Joshua let out a low groan when she succeeding in rubbing her hips against the long shaft. As repayment, he placed the berry in her mouth, to bite the end again. This time he took his half and rubbed the wet hollow inside around each nipple. The sweet juice sliding along her chest. His tongue followed close after, lapping at the juice and sucking each delicate bud into him mouth. He licked and sucked at them until Tamery's persistence with her hips became too much to bear. In a quick instance, he sprang away removing his jeans then pulling her up to her knees on the bed with him. Kissing each other passionately hands exploring each other's bodies. Palms touching backs, fingers along spines, kisses to necklines, caresses to backsides as they tried to melt together. Joshua leaned back on his knees, and pulled Tamery up higher. Holding onto her hips, he guided her onto his hardness. Sliding in her with the sensual ease of a perfect lover. Their bodies becoming one, Tamery riding her lover, astride his lap, and Joshua holding her there as he thrust from below into her warm tight inside.Tamery made low moans as she buried her face into Joshua's neck as she rode him. Kissing his neck as her hips rocked in small circles bringing her body up and down his hardness, the feeling of him buried deep making her moan each time. She clung to his neck, feeling as if she would fall if she didn't hold on tight as they moved together. She felt his hand in her hair, coiling the long curls around his fist until it touched the nape of her neck. He pulled her body back, making her arch back onto the bed as he increased his pace from below. Tamery's body was bent like a bow with Joshua trusting faster, the new position making him feel tighter inside of her. Reaching back again, he brought out a small glass of wine. While holding inside of Tamery, he dripped the red contents onto her bent body, rivulets running down across her breasts. He held her up off the bed to lap at the small streams as he continued to move deep inside. Tamery took the glass and poured the remainder into her mouth. She pulled Joshua down to share the drink in a kiss as they quickened the pace. The need to find each other's release was nearing, they both sensed it, and strived to arrive at the point at the same time. Joshua took another strawberry and placed to rigid end against Tamery's wet folds. Pressing the berry near her hooded center, he held her hips tight to his for the end of their morning breakfast.The ridges on the berry pressed against Tamery's clit, and slid between their bodies each time Joshua moved inside. Soon the berry found it's way into the perfect angle and began making Tamery uncoil from the inside.Joshua felt her tighten around him. Felt her hands digging into his shoulders, her love bite on his shoulder and knew it was time. He thrust harder, holding her by cupping her sweet rounded ass and pounding into her in long strides. She began to shake, and he felt the strawberry mash between them, juice running onto his balls, and she held on tight. A cry escaping her mouth, but catching in her throat. In that span of time, his own breath caught, they came together in one terrific pause of time. They collapsed together, rolling to their sides in the sticky bed. Berries and wine were staining the sheets from their careless tumble. Tamery reached for Joshua's hand as they lay side by side catching their breath. She kissed his palm and placed it on her belly. A sign of contentment from a well-spent morning affair. "I think I like breakfast in bed," she said a flirtatious smile on her face. Joshua smiled too and looked at her face. Hair askew, lips swollen, a dab of berry on her cheek: he thought she was amazing. "I thought you might. Everyone loves fruit."She laughed. Her short snort then a giggle that she gave when she had something amusing on her mind. "Breakfast is the most important meal of the day they say."Joshua rolled to his side, his hand cuddling her cheek and he smiled. "Hmmm, yes. I thought we'd try oatmeal next time." They laughed together too tired to do nothing else but listen to the day begin outside.

      Don't you just hate it when somebody has  urlLink pictures of you  that they promise they will never share, and then you go to their website and see them posted on their blog?  Some people have no respect for private moments.   Bad Arthur!

      Me:So how was work today, baby?  Rick:Pretty good. Oh man! I saw a picture of Mandy's girlfriend today. She is   smokin'  !  Me:Oh yeah?  Rick:Yeah, she is pretty hot! She had a picture in some kind of gay pride newsletter. I was surprised when Mandy showed me her picture, because Mandy is kind of...not as hot.  Me:Hmmm....  Rick:*smiling* She was pretty hot.  Me:(becoming less amused) *sigh* Okay. So what did she look like? (expecting a description of a Salma Hayek look alike)  Rick:Well, I didn't really even get a good look at her face.  Me:Then how do you know she was 'smokin'?  Rick:She was pretty hot.  Me:What was she wearing?  Rick:A swimsuit.  Me:Okay.  Rick:(still smiling)  Me:(not smiling)  Fella's, don't do this. Its great and all that he is comfortable enough to tell me who he thinks is 'smokin', but this conversation was just stupid. Anytime you can make a 5'8", size 4, D cup woman feel fat and ugly, you're using bad judgment. Somebody tell me I'm pretty!! lol Preferably my stupid husband!! He didn't even see her face. Sheesh.

      We are one week away from our son's very first concert. Yes, we will be going to see the Wiggles next Tuesday. I think I may be equally excited to see them! lol We have front row center tickets, which means I'll be ever so close to three of the objects of my mommy affections. *swoon*  The story of the  urlLink Wiggles break up  has surfaced again. LOL! It amazes me how gullible people are. I like how the story closely mimics that of the Beatles. Very clever. And apparently believable to some! I wouldn't mind 'wiggling' with a few Wiggles, or the good Captain, as far as thats concerned. Though I have had many a sweet dream about said affections, I promise not to share them here. lol I'll just keep those tid bits to myself! ;0)

      After what feels like weeks waiting for it, I finally got what I wanted last night!  lol  (you know what I'm talking about! ;0)  Rick had just gotten out of the shower, and I was teasing him about something.  He didn't like what I said, so he pounced on the bed and tackled me, holding my wrists down tightly against the pillows, threatening a tickle attack.  I tried to wiggle free, but he really had me pinned good.  Noticing my predicament, he pulled my wrists down to my side, still firmly holding me still as his tongue traced a line up my leg.  "You don't have to hold me down for that," I say.   At that, he let go of me, sitting down between my legs and reaching his hands up underneath my ass, lifting my bottom half up and towards his face.  I felt a soft kiss on the bare skin before he ran his tongue up and down the length of my slit.  I was already dripping from the mere thought of what was to come.  He was very soft and gentle, which accentuated every movement and made it that much more pleasurable.  Pulling my lips into his mouth, he lightly sucked on them, tasting me and wetting me with his kisses.  I felt his hand walking up my thigh, before reaching up and spreading my pussy, opening me up wide, exposing new areas to be licked.  The cool air on skin that is rarely uncovered was nice, but made me feel overexposed and vulnerable.  Every part of me was focused on my spread lips, trying to anticipate Rick's next move.   As he came down to kiss the new skin, I felt his finger slowly entering me.  He sat up and focused on fucking me with his fingers, going deeper and deeper as he took in the site of my open hole.  He softly took his other hand and probed near my clit, before gently pinching it with his fingers as he quicked his movements with his other hand, still deep within my walls.  I wanted to get out a dildo, and have him fuck me with that, giving him a better view of me, and giving me the added depth and girth, pehaps reaching down and rubbing my clit for him as he watched and plunged the silicone dick in and out.  But I sensed he was enjoying finger fucking me, and may not wish to forfeit that to a toy.  Pulling me closer to him, I could feel the tip of his dick, sliding against my well lubricated pussy.  I wanted to sit up and impale myself on him, to feel his shaft against my walls.  Rick knew I wanted him, and got up on his knees to accomodate.  In a painfully slow motion, he inserted himself, one tiny bit at a time.  I wanted to buck up against him, but sat still, enjoying the tease.  When I finally felt his balls sitting on top of me, I thought I would explode in ecstasy.  He started to pull out, but I held him down, lifting my hips and wrapping my legs around his back, giving his cock that extra half inch of depth that made my box erupt into orgasm, squeezing and stroking his shaft from within.  "Don't move," I begged, as I rode out the waves for several minutes before allowing him to pull out.  Once the contractions slowed, Rick grabbed me by the ankles, ripping my legs open, making me again vulnerable to him.  A quick lick from pussy to clit and he rammed himself into me.  I gasped in surprise, his arms spreading my legs even further, so far they nearly touched the bed.  His movements picked up speed, fucking me hard and fast, balls thumping against my ass.  I could feel another orgasm building as his grunts indicated that he too was close.  He pulled out just as I was about to climax, so I quickly fingered my clit as he exploded on me, and joined him in orgasm.  Ahhhhhhh! *contented sigh*

      Okay, I have been playing around with the links option, and think I have figured out what I did wrong. Lets see, shall we? ;0)  Click  urlLink here  to see this site translated in Smurf. (you may have to be a child of the eighties to appreciate this one)   urlLink Here  is the link, should you want to translate another page to Smurf. (you know you want to!)  And finally,  urlLink here  is where I got that link, from  urlLink Rich's blog . He also has lots of cool tips for your computer, that are completely over my technologically challenged head, but are sure to be groovy.  Hope I got it right this time!

      Or at least mine are/were.  My veterinary stethescope was near a hundred dollars, no frills.    Thats the cheap one.  My 'people' stethescope was engraved and otherwise just plain spiffy.  It was also quite a bit pricier, but it was  a gift.  Imagine the pain of finding said spiffy stethescope chewed in half, one part sitting in the litter box and the other part still being chewed on by a soon to be extinct kitty.  Also, I feel ill seeing the wide range of prices on stethescopes online.  Someone should have told me about that  before  I spent all that money!  I keep telling myself that they are probably really crappy compared to mine. lol  Anything to ease the pain.

      You all know the large sexual appetite I have, but if there is one place I feel should be 100% sexless, its Disney World.  (well, theres lots of places that should remain sexless, but they don't pertain to my story)  The Magical Kingdom is just that to children~magical.  They shouldn't be exposed to any sick type of perversion at Disney, its just twisted and wrong.  Rick and I went to Disney World for our honeymoon, and I don't even think we kissed in the park.  Not to say we didn't have fun, in fact we felt like kids, running around the park and experiencing all the attractions with eager child like enthusiasm.   Its disgusting to think of some jerk getting off by dressing up in a costume that children will be instantly drawn to, and then inappropriatly touching them.  Surely theres a special place in hell for these sickos.  I understand Disney's side, about wanting to alter the costume so as not to link the Tigger character to such a lewd act.  I tend to think that won't be possible though, as it sounds like the guy's lawyer buddy is also a pedaphile with a similar job.  How do you "inadvertantly" touch a 13 year old's breast?  Blech.  And the bastard was dressed as my favorite Disney character.  Makes you think twice about the innocent 'characters' roaming around the park.

      Rich asked a question that I believe was asking whether or not my husband reads this blog.  (again, I hope I'm not misinterpreting this lol)  He does not.  He knows that I blog though.  I told him the day I set it up, and he asks me everyday how its doing.  I almost told him the name of it, only because I am proud of it, and have had many compliments on it.  I've come so far as to ask him, "Have you ever heard someone say 'a taste of the good life'?", basically building up to tell him the name of my blog.  "Yeah, why?"  And I chickened out.  I immediatly pictured him retaining the name and looking it up.  Thats what I would do, anyway.  Hes asked to read my blog, and I've told him, "You don't want to read my blog.  Its like an online journal.  You aren't into that kind of thing."  Which is true, and he agrees.   I'm not 100% positive how Rick would react to this blog.  (could I possibly say the word 'blog' anymore! lol)  Its basically devoted to him, really.  A recollection of our intimate encounters and such.  But perhaps that is what would bother him the most.  The intimacy being shared online.  He wouldn't be surprised to find out I was attracted to Hans, I told him myself, and he thought it was rather humorous.  I really can't think of anything on this site that  would  surprise him.  I love my husband, and I believe my postings are proof of that matter.   Actually I can think of something I posted that may embarrass him.  The terrible trauma my pillow experienced. lol  But for crying out loud, if seeing it in black and white will make the madness stop, then I'm all for it! lol   That aside, I don't believe there is any reason for me to feel guilty about this site.  And should he some day stumble across it, I don't believe we would be any worse for wear.  Its the internet, and its completely anonymous.  Names have been changed to protect the innocent. lol   Now I pose a question to you.  How would you feel if your wife/husband ran a blog describing your sex life, just as I've done here?  Say you are Rick, and found this site.  Tell me how you would feel.

      Well, my plans were thrown off a bit last night.  We ended up staying up later than intended watching the Cardinals/Giants game.  Almost gave up in the first, when Matt Morris' lovely pitches gave the Giants a 7 nothing lead.  Holy cow!  But once he was replaced, the game got interesting.  It came down to one poorly thought out play in the end, that let the Giants win by only one run.  Bummer.  But it was an exciting game.  I'm being called into the living room now to watch tonight's game.  lol   We finally got to bed at around 12:45, and I was exhausted after the whole day at the picnic.  I really just planned on sleeping, I didn't even have the energy to fantasize about Hans. lol  Rick had other plans.  His hand went up my night shirt, and feeling no underwear, he was quick to wet his fingers and begin playing.  Normally this would signal me to be more active, but my exhaustion kept me still and let Rick do as he wanted.   His right hand kneaded my thigh and ass, as his left reached up to my hair, lightly tugging it.  I could hear the sound of his lips on his fingers, as he lubed himself with the spit, before I felt the pressure of his dick against my ass.  Very slowly, I felt myself open up around his fullness, letting him inside of me.  His right hand soon found my breast, grabbing it with urgency, trying to convey to me his pleasure.  With each small thrust of his cock, he delved a little deeper, his panting growing stronger.  I reached my right arm behind me and squeezed his ass with each jut of his pelvis.  Rick is so verbal during anal sex, its such a turn on.   He continued tugging at my hair, forcing my neck back as he fucked my ass with growing intensity.  As his grunts became louder, I knew he was close.  "Ohhh...mmm...I'm gonna come in your ass!" he spit out, just before I felt his shaft pulsing deep within me, pumping out his load.  He slapped my bottom before pulling out and kissing my neck.  ( does this count for non-pull-out sex fairest? lol  just curious ;0)   I'm usually very active during sex, but every once in a while, I enjoy being Rick's sex toy to be used as he sees fit.  This is usually when he chooses anal sex.   Well, I'm told the Cardinals are winning so far, so I guess I'll go catch the rest of the game, hopefully not to be disappointed!  They still have the best win/loss record in the league.  Yay!  Listen to me, being all sporty!  Rick would be so proud!
