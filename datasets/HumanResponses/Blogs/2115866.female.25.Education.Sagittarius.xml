      Ever since I started writing about soul mates last night I've been thinking about nothing but...  I mean not only what if you didn't recognize them as the other half of you, but what if, God forbid they were married or had died or were gay?  What then?  Does life just end? Or do you go on and find a mate that just seems suitable to you as a spouse?  What is the plan for if for some reason you couldn't BE with your soulmate?  If they're married or whatever does that mean they aren't actually your soul mate and have discovered their soul mate in their current partner?  In that case, they probably weren't your soul mate to begin with but just say they had settled for someone and WERE your soulmate, what then?  So many questions and so few answers....  Which in my opinion just would suck and stuff...  Anyway thats it for tonight its to bed with me, before I think of other things that could get me in more trouble...  :0)  Laters....

      Today for the first time I heard a reference to Tigger in one of my classes...  I've been in education classes for like 2 years and my declared major until last semester was elementary education and it took this long to get a Tigger reference?  Damn skippy, talk about your running behind...  It was in my 10 oclock class this morning talking about unorganized classrooms and the professor made a comment about kids bouncing off walls like they were Tigger...  Cute huh?  :0)  Also in class today, I started thinking about where I'm going to live after graduation next May...  Sure with mom in Houston for a bit while I interview for jobs and get certified and stuff...  But after that, where do I want to live and work?  Up til this last summer I would have said New Braunfels, hands down....  Now its a toss up between Austin , San Antonio, San Marcos and New Braunfels..  Austin, I like but I don't know if I'd like living there...  San Antonio, its a city in south central Texas, close to the hill country and the beach and New Braunfels, as much as I've come to adore it, is a bit of a tourist trap...  So yeah, decisions, decisions and stuff...  Which brings me (kind of) to the subjects of blind dates...  I have to decide whether or not to to go home and once I decide THAT I have to decide if I should let a friend of mine set me up or not...  He made me promise to at least consider it, and what can I say he caught me at a weak moment (8 am he called and I was still asleep, unable to form any sort of coherent thought...) and now I'm beating myself up over it... I adore this guy, he's one of my really good friends, but there are very few people I trust to set me up and none of them are straight guys. (as this particular friend trying to set me up is.)  I don't trust blind dates, I've seen too many end... on less than friendly terms, shall we say...  The only time I've been set up (wasn't actually a formal 'set-up' more like matchmaking) was my best friend Natalie with one of her now husband then boyfriend's Marine buddies...  It might have worked out too, had he not gone AWOL and schizo...  He was a really good guy, just my type, but it just wasn't going to work since he came back paranoid about 'the man' getting him...  So yeah there ended my brief foray into blind dating...  Speaking of dating...  I've been thinking about soulmates lately...  Yeah I believe that everyone has a soulmate somewhere and when you meet them you just somehow know, you know?  But I just got to thinking, what would happen if we didn't recognize our soulmates?  Pass them on the street or in traffic,and don't even give them a second glance because we don't recognize them...  Kind of a scary thought....  But on a brighter note, I'm more and more sure I'm going home on Thursday for the weekend!  I miss my house and my town and my Firehouse  and my Galleria and my Central Market....  (ok so maybe I don't own them, but I should at least have stock in them I go there so often...)  And both my sisters will be in town, how sweet is that?  All 3 Fritz girls loose in the city...  *evil laugh*  :0)  Anyway its time for lil ol me to hit the hay hay hay...  I'm still exsausted from yesterday... Anyway, laters....

      I hate it when men cry...  Perhaps hate is too strong a word...  I sympathize greatly with men who cry...  That sounds more accurate.  It rips my heart, to see a guy reduced to tears...  I can't help but cry too.  But I watched Tarzan tonight on the WB, and when Travis Fimmel, as Tarzan, walked into the room he lived in as a boy, tears running down his cheeks, I started to cry too...  It was such a moment...  I don't know if its that he's a really REALLY good actor to make me believe he's a guy thats lived in a jungle for 20 years and comes back after being kidnapped by his evil uncle only to fall in love with a cop and has some major issues with his family overall and knowing who to trust and not to trust or that hes a really hot guy crying...  Either is a distinct possibility.  But then again I've always had a weakness for blonds, shaggy haired or not...  Which brings to mind an episode of Cribs I saw today...  With Paul Walker...  Gawd I love that man...  Plays guitar, surfs and looks amazing to boot...  What's not to love?  Yeah its another one of those blond guy things, horrible of me I know...  But anyway, my day....  Actually let me start with yesterday....  We didn't ever go wedding dress shopping, in fact we didn't leave for Russellville until about 9 or so last night...  Enjoyed the hot tub, as always and started my own fan club....  So far, I've got a lab, a sheltie, and cat as members, any other applicants?  :0)  So anyway we didn't leave there until dawn after a night of doing laundry, and watching both the Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring Special Edition AND the Two Towers, we finally left about 7 or this morning and by 8 am I was in bed for the first time all night...  So yeah its the first all nighter I've pulled in years....  Without drinking (ok 2 sips of a margerita) or live music or surrounded by smoke or even studying for that matter...  A rather nice change I find...  :0)  So needless to say I slept most of the day, almost till 3...  Had to run to Walmart and get Dr. Pepper, as I was COMPLETELY out...  Thats a bad bad thing as everyone knows...  :0)  But anyway, other than that, my life's not all that exciting at the moment....  Though heres a bit of trivia for you....  Why is it that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is called that when the true story happened in someplace like Wisconsin?  Why does Houston have soooo much crime?  And lastly, why do I feel as though I've opened a Pandora's box by letting certain friends of mine, who happen to be very opinionated, know that a website like this existed?  :0)  That's about it for now...  More laters....

      School sucks, but its nessacity....  I mean come on how teachers do you know withOUT a bachelor's degree in something or another?  At least I get the hell gone in May...  Speaking of graduation....  I'm pretty sure I'm skipping my own and going to Lauren's in Ft. Worth...   To me its only a walking across a stage and getting a little piece of paper a few monthes later to prove you've survived the college experience....  I've got enough memories to do that thank you very much...  I think in college I can honestly say I learned most of what I know about the world in college....  Kinda ironic since I grew up in Houston, and then went  to college in small towns, that just happened to be in 'dry' counties  *throat clearing* "Yeah, right..."  ANYWAY...  even though I grew up in H-town (aren't I o so ghetto now?) I was fairly sheltered, by my family and then by my friends...  I had to get out in order to discover the true me...  The oxymoron that is me that is...  Or walking contradiction as Brody likes to say....  Its always been true and I suppose it may always be true...  Cuz if it wasn't I'd be a schizo, in which case that would just suck...  Speaking of college and high school and friends I got to thinking today about how I've burned alot of bridges with people I was friends with or at least friendly with in both locations...  And now that I look back and realize that it makes me a bit sad because some of them were awesome people in their own right.  And ya know I love awesome peeps... And not so awesome ones on occasion...  Though I think everyone can be awesome in some way...  Whether it be in the looks department or in some facet of their personality that is just soooo.... unique you just can't help but want to be around them you know?  Which kind of but not really leads me to birthdays....  Mines not till the 6th of December...  A Saturday this year....  But James's B-day is Sunday so we're gathering around ye old hot tub hopefully with some cocktails Saturday night to celebrate....  I need it after the week I've had...  But I digress, So anyway Heather and I are going to look for wedding dresses tommorrow in Russellville and sort of make a day of that and then go to James' so she can do laundry too...  She can't seem to find what shes looking for and I personally think she's just going to wind up making it anyway, since shes so handy dandy with a needle and thread and stuff...  And while we're out and about we'll see if I can find the pieces to complete my pirate outfit....  If worse comes to worse I can always look for something if I go home next weekend, which seems to be looking like more and more of what I want to do, since not just Linz will be there, but Lauren's driving down from Wort Forth....  Oops I meant Ft. Worth.. hehehe....  I watched on the edge of country tonight and the first video I see is Charlie Robison's 'Right Man for the Job', where he's doing nothing more than walking around a town looking like a pimp, cane and all...  Good name for ol' Charlie, Pimp Charlie Char char....  Hardy har har....  :0)  Then at one point in the video he joins a break dancing group...   Either very scary or very funny depending on your point of view I'm leaning toward the scary side...  Music television leads me into the subject of sellouts...  The listypoo goes like this: #1 Toby Queer, #2 Kenny Chesney, and #3 Green Day (though I love the fact they made punk more popular).   Toby becase he made the ultimate insult to a song or truck and appeared, playing his guitar in a Ford commmercial singing one of his songs....  Its one thing for Fowler's, Cooder Graw's,  or Cross Canadian Ragweed's songs to be used for a Dodge truck commercial, but Queerish's song for Ford?  Its an insult to Ford!  I drove one for 3 years and sure we had issues, but it survived my whole family, 3 beginning drivers and my mom, as well as my aunt and one of my cousins...  Not alot of people can say that about anything!  As for Kenny Chesney....  He needs 4 or 5 other guys to write his shitey little ditties a 1st grader could write....  Though y a 1st grader would I shudder to think...   Female singers in modern country music are simply overplayed....  Faith Hill's ok in small doses, Shania Twain I can't stand anymore, and I love Reba, but the Nashvegas isn't putting out a lot of her stuff her lately, maybe because she's been on Broadway and TV and stuff, but who really knows for sure?  Sure I envy them all their success, but I still can't stand the Nashville sound.  Though if a guy is hot like Keith Urban, Dierks Bentley or Andy Griggs, I'll give him half a chance if only to stare at them....  I'm not ashamed to admit that, I'm a woman and I enjoy men, so whatcha gonna do?  Sue me for all two dollars I currently have?  That'd just be wrong...  :0)But anyway back to female singers... I think that chicks like Fannin Franklin and Miranda Lambert deserve more props than they're getting...  Though Miranda WAS on Nashville Star...  However successful that was...  That guy sucks too...  A demo singer for 10 years and still plugging away?  And he had a family to support too!  Also wrong...  Unless his wife was an independantly wealthy woman or something...  I've dated musicians, they don't make a lot and most of what they make goes to traveling expenses (food, hotel, equipment), recording, and probably what seems to me the biggest expense, alcohol...    I mean how much Jager can you possibly drink?  On that note, I think I'd better wind this down and go to bed, so I'm more fully prepared to shop till I drop tommorrow, though if I do it till I drop, then I'll be gone till Christmas...  Although, wedding dress shopping seems to take more out of me than that, even though I'm not doing more than just giving my opinion on the stuff Heather's trys on...  Oh, well...  Laters....

      So I just got back on my computer to try to search for some stuff on a movie I was watching earlier, but for some reason Yahoo, MSN, and Google, my 3 usual search engines refused to work....  Don't they just suck...  So I'm sitting here listening to late night talk shows, trying to figure out whether or not I'm going to go home next week for Fall Break....  Its only a 4 day weekend and 2 of those would be sent traveling...  But Cooder Graw and Boland and the Stragglers are at the Firehouse....  Ya gotta know I love me some Monty...  ;0)  The only thing I love more than Monty is some Bleu but thats about as likely as me surfing a 50 foot wave bare ass naked...  But anyway I don't know whether I'll go home or not.....  I'm also trying to figure out whether or not Pat Green is playing at UCA on Nov. 13th, cuz its on his webpage but I've heard from 2 guys here on campus its been canceled because his wife is having issues with her pregnancy....  I'm inclined to believe them but I think I'll call UCA just in case....  Its not like the world will end if I don't see Pat play, since I saw him with Phil Pritchett and Cross Canadian Ragweed back in July and thats the first time in almost 2 years I've seen him live....  Last time was at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo....   Oh, my, those were some good times...  *evil laugh*  :0)  Also it dawns on me, since I do my best thinking at night, that I have no idea what's wrong with the world today...  UT lost to OU, ok I can understand that, OU is better (shh, lets keep that on the downlow) but I gotta be loyal to my TU, ya know?  Even though we all know that when they play A & M whom my loyalties switch to....  :0)  As for the world series (should that be capitalized?), I could have predicted that in the preseason....  At least on the part of the Yankees...  The Marlins just got lucky playing Chicago in the playoffs....  How the Hades did THEY get into the playoffs?  Did someone die, or get bribed?!?!?!   What the heck happened to my Astros?  Too much drama with the changing of the home fields and then the changing of said home field's name like 4 times in the preseason?  Ok, ok so I forgive them, since they were closer than they ever have been....  Which leads me into Ahh-nold.... Not really but we'll pretend it did... Who voted and how the hell did he get elected as governor?  Can anyone actually understand anything that man says?  Can he even run even though he was born in Austria or wherever???   NEway I should get to bed, even though my 10 oclock class tommorrow morning has been canceled, somy first class isn't until 2...  Actually my only class...  Go me huh?  NEhow hi ho hi ho its off to bed I go!!!  Laters....

      It just occurred to me over my dinner of Smores Pop Tarts, that for those of you who read this, that I put nothing about myself...  Sure I put stuff about my life, but no background info for which someone could form a mental image of me or what my life is like...  So here's the dealio...  I'm a 24 years old, 25 in December, female type person.  I'm from Houston, TX originally and I'm a senior at University of the Ozarks in Clarksville, AR....  I graduate from this popsicle stand in May and plan to move to Central Texas, most likely San Marcos, New Braunfels, or Austin areas...  I like traveling, all sorts of music, reading, kids and animals....  Don't like liars, cheats, or drama....  I'm 5'5", green eyes, average build, currently have red hair and wear glasses....  Currently single, but have a couple of prospects....  I'm boy crazy, so shoot me....  I'm a smart ass, and I think I have a good sense of humor.....  But that's about all I can think to put here for now, unless I go into detail on my current crush, who I can go on about forever, but I won't, you can thank me later....  :0)  With that, I'm gone again....  Laters....

      Hey, yall... Wow, my very first post...   I feel almost all powerful...  *insert evil laugh*  Today, not alot happened.  Though I should have gone to see one of my professors, she wasn't ever in her office....  Doesn't she know she should be awaiting my every whim?  Hehehe...  Today was picture day so of course I had to dress really nicely, and I did get a few compliments...  Oh, by the way, this is the outfit I bought at the Gap for like fifty dollars and when I tried it on asked the 3 guys waiting on me if they'd do me in that outfit...  Nice reaction on that one....  Gawd I love being a redhead!!!     Yesterday I went to Russellville and found another 2 pieces for my Halloween costume, who knew being a pirate was such work? Now to completely change the subject, cuz I'm just random that way....  :0)  I just saw Reckless Kelly's 'Nobody's Girl'  video followed by Cooder Graw's 'Better Days' video on GAC, and I almost cried, seriously...  All these bands I love are starting to get so popular they're on CMT and GAC and stuff....  And I can now watch this program on GAC where I'm ALMOST guarnteed I won't be forced to see Tim Mc -ew, his wife or Kenny Chesney or Toby Queer (sure hes from Texas, but that doesn't excuse his behavior, his songs, and his overall being....  Anyway I think thats if for today....  Maybe I'll go to quarter beer night since i don't have any homework....   Laters.

      Since its been a week since I last did this I'll recap my week right quick...  Monday - stressful day from hell...  seems as though everything I had to do had to be done Monday....  Plus pack and stuff to leave on Tuesday...  Tuesday drove home to Houston, hung out with my mom and sisters, went out for a piece of pie with Brody to celebrate his birthday, came home, discovered text messaging with my sisters and slept....  Wednesday, went to the mall, shopped a bit ate lunch with a friend and his roomie...  Went home hung out with my family some more, rented Boat Trip (don't see it), and Bend it Like Beckham (very good), made stuff for Turkey day, the usual...  Thursday ate lunch about 1 ish with mom and my sisters as well as mom's boyfriend John and my sister's boyfriend Mike, as well as Baby whose a family friend....  We sat around talking and eating for hours...  Literally we didn't leave the table till 4....  Only then to move into the living room for another hour or 2...  Friday, more shopping, this time for birthday presents for me...  went out for my birthday dinner at Vincent's...  Had the world's greatest margerita pizza there...  I like margerita pizza but I didn't know it could taste so good....   Then my sisters and I went to see Love actually...  Very, very good...  Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, never a bad combination....  Came back to Arkansas Saturday in order to avoid today's traffic...  Missed seeing Bleu at the Sidecar Pub though...  Which I do regret, but I'll be spending New Years with him at the Firehouse so its all good....  Today, I slept late and started unpacking, ate, and was finally able to fully check my email...  Which I haven't read since Friday...  112 messages in my Yahoo inbox alone...  Currently watching Cats and Dogs, which is interesting to say the least...  But anyway on the way back yesterday I had some interesting thoughts...  As well as creating some....  unique road games...  I made up 3 new games (that I can remember)...  One was "Ew, what's that? - The Road Kill Game", can you guess the rules?  :0)  Another was how many 18 wheelers can I pass in 5 minutes....  Again self explanatory...  :0)  And the last was one you can play anywhere, Name that Tune...  An oldie but a goodie for sure...  :0)  As for interesting thoughts here's my current view on religion...  Yes I believe in some higher being that created humans and the earth (though in 7 days???), but I don't see this being as male or female (though my friend Sean calls him the Big Dude in the Sky), nor do I see this being as being a vengeful or angry god...  I think that he/she is more like a loving parent or guardian angel...  One who knows whats right for you and what path you should walk in life, you just have to trust and have faith that things will work out as they should (as hard as that may be)...  I also believe that the Bible is wrong...  From the feminist point of view its full of complete and utter bull about the role of women in history...  Take Adam and Eve for example, Eve took the apple from the snake, sure, but snakes are phallic symbols and maybe she was horny, who knows  for sure?  But Adam, on the other hand, didn't have to take the apple...  So why did he?  We may never know...  As for pets having souls, thats another load of hooey (as well as a bone of contention I have with most organized religions)...  I think that pets not only have souls and go to heaven tehy become intergral parts of a family...  And lastly, there's the whole homosexual issue....  Every organized religion I've ever seen has not wanted, not allowed or not advocated gay marriages or gay issues....  Which is just irritating, vexing and downright upsetting to me.... Seeing as to how one of my best friends is gay and I've debated the issue of religion with him for years...  And I'm starting to agree with him, no religion wants gays involved with it...  And they don't realize what they're missing out on.....   Gay men are the world's greatest shopping buddies/confidante as well as not being back stabbing bitches (most of them) than a lot of girls I know (but not all)...  Anyway thats about it for now, unless I wanted to write about a dream I had about a friend of mine's brother's ex roommate...  Nah...  Laters....

      So its been a rather interesting weekend to say the least...  I've had more alcohol in the last 4 days than I have in the past 4 monthes...   Ok, so that might be a slight exaggeration, but not by much...  Thursday night, Friday night and last night I've had margeritas out the who-ha along with about half a bottle of champagne...  I pulled my second all nighter in the last 2 weeks, whereas, I haven't done that in freakin' forever...  Amazingly enough, almost the exact same people kept me company...  Well at least 2 of the same people....  Peaches wound up hanging out with Amanda and I and we stayed up till like 8 this morning...  That was tons of fun...  hehehe...  :)  Once again like all we did was watch movies and flirt, but that was fun too...  Flirting always is....  :)  Oh, and by the way he hates being called Peaches, he glares at us every time we call him that...  Quite funny really...  I would say we should hang out with him more often, but alas, everytime we do we stay up all freakin' night...   Not a bad thing, usually, but today I've been trying to do homework and not getting alot accomplished...  Speaking of which I should probably get back to since I have at least 8 pages to type up and 42 tests/activities left to find before 2morrow...  Lucky me, huh?  I was going to get started on all this stuff yesterday but I got the world's next to worst (Monday being the worst) migraine...  Not conducive to doing homework or reading of any sort really...  :0)  Besides that only one of my teams (football) didn't get their butts kicked....  Rice University, who'da thunk it?  Meanwhile, U of H, the Texans, Baylor, and TCU all got whomped on....  While Texas Tech was only completely and totally abducted by aliens, subjected to anal probes and sent back as what seemed to be pod people....  I have never been to dissappointed and impressed by the other team so much as I was in this game...  I found there is a reason that OU is #1 in the rankings...  They're good...  Damn good...  Anywho, hi ho hi ho its back to homework I go!! Laters...

      Ok, lucky for me I'm Irish German and don't get drunk easily...  Though with the frequency with which I drink, I'm surprised, really I am.  For example, i had a little bit of margerita, 2 half glasses of champagne, a half glass of mimosa (half champagne/half orange juice) and then a full glass of mimosa....  Hence the reason I am so lethargic and nice and toasty warm....  Though my toes STILL aren't warm.... They never are as most everyone who knows me realizes....  :0)  Runs in my family, just like bossiness...  I'm not drinking for any other reason but to celebrate my singlehood....  Tried something, failed at it.... Moving on....  Though for a while I felt as though I was in junior high with all the he said she said he said that you said gossip I heard...  But you know what?  That doesn't bug me now...  I'm too darn happy to give a flying flip in hell...  Wheeeeeee......   Laters....

      I go home in less than a week....  Tuesday I leave here and go home, and Wednesday morning I wake up in my own bed...  As comfy as my bed at school is its too small...  For sleeping alone or with someone, or doing anything else in it for that matter.... Needless to say it'll be nice to sleep in my own bed again...  Even though no one will be there to share it, except my sisters, and they don't really count cause you've always done that....  (no not that, sleep, get your minds out of the gutter.)  Speaking of my sisters, theres a bit of drama there....  My youngest sister went with her boyfriend to Dallas and she didn't get to spend a lot of time with our other sister, who lives in Ft. Worth, which is why I thought Lauren (in Ft. Worth) was upset with Lindsay (the one who went to Dallas)....   Turns out its only because Mike (the boyfriend) who at 28 is 8 years older than Lindsay (whose 20)... And thats the only reason....  I think Lauren forgets that our father was 19 almost 20 years older than our mother, either that or it effected her differently than me (I'd date Mel Gibson if he was single and I had a shot)....  Either way she's a bit narrow minded about it....  Says guys that much older are scum....  Ok, La, if you say so.....   Speaking of having a  shot with guys you're (I'm) attracted to...  I've realized something...  I'm a little sister to some, sure, and one of the guys most of the time, but I am still a girl and a tease to boot...  But no that's not what I realized, though that is a pertinent fact, I realized that in order to have a shot with a guy you've got to see him on an almost daily basis, which usually is no problem, (and I knew b4 but realized yet again - sort of blond of me I know) but with my current crush....  I only see him once every couple of weeks, so probably nothing will ever come of it, but hey its nice to have a crush....  And I realize too that just reading these blogs makes it look like I'm boy crazy (which I am) but also that it makes it look as though I live my life around them which I most definitely DO NOT....   Anyway its off to do yet more homework.....  :0)  Laters. PS The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show is on tonight, whoo hoo!!!!!  Go me!!!!!!!!!!

      A friend of mine told me I'm the sort of person who, when I find something I really like, whether it's a guy or a musical group or a movie or whatever, I pour an awful lot of energy into it.  He then went on to say that it's not necessarily bad, but I tend to get bored with something or someone real fast because my attraction to it is so intense...  I've thought about that alot and things I've done in that and its true....  I'm not obsessive but when I'm into something or someone, I go overboard and I can't figure out how to stop or slow down....   Kind of like going on a roller coaster, then bungee jumping, and sky diving one right after the other, so you get the adrenaline high of one, don't have time to recover and then get more and more adrenaline till it feels like your going to explode....  You know?  Its not a necessarily bad its just not a good way to conduct relationships...  :0)  Like I get a new CD or movie and I can't take it out of the VCR or CD player, whatever the case may be, till I get sick of it and then I rarely listen to or watch it later.  That doesn't work with men...  They won't sit around till you(me) make up your(my) mind and wait for you (me) to make up your(my) mind when you(I) want them...  Its not fair and its not nice, to run hot and cold like that....  But I'll figure it out eventually, I always do...   In other news, I went to the playground down the street today for an assignment I had to do and stayed there for a bit longer just spending time with myself, which I haven't done in a while....  No music, no TV, no distractions of any sort....  It was nice, I got some things taken care of....  Found my center, and cleaned the slate, so to speak....  I even had a moment!!!  I found out some stuff about myself, I hadn't realized...  Things about my expectations, the obsession thing, and my goals....  I left the park at about 3, smiling and feeling so much more refreshed....  Anyway, thats about it for today...  Laters....

      I talked to my mom last night and as it turns out we're both pissed at our bank...  They said they put the money in my account in September but I never saw it...  I've been looking for my September statement and I haven't found it yet, but when I do...  Oh, boy are they gonna get it!!!   And if I'm wrong, though Lord knows if I am it'll be a first for a Fritz or Daley, then I'll deal with that too...  Today though I had a massive migraine so not much got done....  I went to my 10 oclcok class and came home for lunch and about 1 or so my entire head started pounding...  It's only been in the last hour or so I've started feeling normal again...  There for a while it was so bad my vision was blurred and I was queasy...  Also in my 10 oclcok class I found out something that made me feel small and vindictive...  One of the people I'm not very fond of, who thinks he can sing and play guitar but can't carry a tune in a bucket....  Well I found out that he is lucky to even be alive....  A girl I know and I were discussing this and she's like yeah back when he was 13 he had a brain tumor/cancer and he has a scar across the back of his head from where they did surgery....  He was so sick from chemo and radiation he could barely walk and had to have assistance to get from class to class....   All I could say was, Oh....  And feel abot a millimeter tall....   Made me think about Link and when he transferred into SBMS back in like 7th grade and how supportative everyone was of him...  He was bald and was allowed to wear a cap and bandanna and he was the only one in school allowed to do that...  He made it through and was (and is as far as I know) one heck of a sweet guy....  He was a cheerleader our senior year, so I think he made a pretty full recovery....   :0)  But anyway other less weighty issues I've thought of...  Let's see, I decided today that it sucks to loose relationships with the families of exes (whatever sort fo ex they may be)....  One of my ex friends has the world's greatest parents and since I don't speak to him, I don't speak to them....  Another instance, my sister's ex boyfriend....  He was like a little brother and his mother and I were like 2 peas in a pod...  But since they broke up in June, I haven't spoken to her....  There are a few others I can think of but those are the 2 that are most recent and that I can think of off the top of my head...  Thats it 4 nowski...  Laters....

      Ok so some conclusions that I've come to this weekend....    1.  I'm not mean, just very much a tease...  ;0)  2.  I am in fact a tease....  3.  I like to flirt (doh)  4.  My taste in men is questionable....  What happened to make me draw these conclusions? Lets see, my friend Chuck came into town and we hung out and stuff...  Friday night me, Heather, Chuck and James went to the coffee house and I flirted with Dillon...  Then O'Neal showed up and Heather and I were talked into going to see Matrix Revolutions (Or whatever new Matrix movie it was that came out this week) with Adam and Andrea...  Then we all (except Andrea cuz I think shes scared of us) went back to our house where Amanda joined our happy little group...  There was a bit of drama when Chuck thought he lost his wallet, turns out it was in James' car...  That was sort of funny in a its not really funny, but it is cause I had the giggles sort of way...  Anyway we all wound up watching the end of the 2nd Harry Potter, the 2nd Matrix movie and Jay and Silent Bob Strike back....   James, Adam, and Heather all left and/or went to sleep....  Chuck, Amanda, O'Neal and I all stayed up to 6 am, though I think I was the only one who didn't cat nap.  Sure I laid down but I was fully awake and mostly coherent.  Had fun playing with O'Neal....  He should hang out with us more often...  Actually Heather and I discussed this later and thought that maybe we should have some sort of group get together once every couple of weeks, since we hardly see out little group of friends anymore.... And we rarely if ever have company over, and hardly ever have guys over....  It makes me very very sad as I LOVE guys....   There's a whole lotta estrogen around this house, too much at times I think....   Anyway where was I?  Oh, yeah, playing with O'Neal....  So we finally did it... Went home or to bed that is, though not together.....  :0)  So Saturday (amazingly enough I woke up at noon!)  Chuck, Heather and I went to visit Clif then went to Walmart....  Then we came home ate and went to Paul and Brandy's....  Eventually Adam and James came over, we drank, talked, and pretty much watched Paul play a video game...  Pretty much a fun time....Today Chuck went home and I slept late and finally checked my email for the first time since Friday and now here I am about to do homework!  Lucky me huh? Laters!

      Well, I heard something really disturbing yesterday and I woke up to hearing on the news this morning, and again at lunch...  And I'm sure if I looked at the local paper I'd see it there too....  A little girl who was only 10 (10!!!!!) was killed in a fire that destroyed her house.  Her mother and father escaped with her 2 younger sisters.  That's not the worst part of it...  The fact that when firefighters when in they found the girl, Molly, CHAINED TO HER BED!!!!  It makes me sick to hear about shit like this....  A friend of mine first told me about it in class yesterday and I almost burst into tears...  I half expect something like this in Houston, or Dallas, bigger cities you know?  Lots of crime, lots more sickos...  But for it to happen in Clarksville, a town of only about 7 thousand, supported mainly by Tyson, Walmart and the college, it just seems....  There isn't really a word for what it is....  Its just wrong, sickening....   And a plethora of other adjectives besides.... I suppose that when I'm up here, I forget about things like traffic and crime and all the other disadvantages of a bigger city....  Anyway I'm going to go work with Connie, todays my last day with her....  I just want to go up to her and give her a huge hug...  You know, reaffirm that life isn't horrid....  Laters.

      Well there are at least 4 things I can think of I wanted to talk about losing touch with friends, Custer's last stand, Cross Canadian Ragweed, and immature attitudes towards attractive members of the opposite sex.  First of all losing touch with friends...  I have come to realize recently that I've lost touch for whatever reason with a lot of really good friends.  A couple from high school, and some from my first year of college and relationships that developed while I was working and other friendships that I've had at U of O....  For instance, I'll hear from a friend of a friend of the sibling of a friend or one of my siblings about whats new with an old friend...  And that sorta sucks.  I know long distance relationships of any sort are hard to keep up, but I think this is verging on ridiculous....  But that could be just me...   This has also got me thinking more about high school, and I don't know why when that part of my life is over and I've moved on and let go of whatever happened there....  I guess its just I've been watching too many talk shows that talk about reuniting people with their high school crushes and I think for just a minute or so What if I called about one of my old crushes?  What could happen?  (or not happen as the case may be.)  But then reality slams back into me and I realize how stupid that sounds and how much I'd have to be clinging to the past in order to do that, and my life is so much different now, better (so much so) than it was in high school, so why can I not quit thinking about it here lately?  Maybe my sister's graduation from TCU sort of triggered it...  And the fact that 7 years after I graduated high school I'm finally graduating college...  Sure I took a year off and only like a semester's worth of hours trasferred up here from LMC, but still that fact that all said and done its taken me 6 years to get through school combined with the fact my degree is going to say general studies makes me feel ashamed of myself...  Like I've screwed up my college career....  When I know a lot of it was remedial classes and some of it was repeating a couple of classes, that makes me think I'm graduating dammit and that makes me proud of myself...  You know?  I mean only about half of my graduating class that started college wound up at HCC and about a quarter of those didn't finish at all....  That makes me feel better...  Ok onward and upward and off my soap box....  Next thing on ye old agenda, Cross Canadian Ragweed...  I saw a CCR decal on the back of a white blazer....  Not so unusual I know, but on the back of a white blazer with Arkansas plates in the middle of northwest Arkansas of all places...  That made my afternoon...  :0)  Next, Custer's last stand...Was anyone else uunaware that he was considered a hero?  I grew up thinking he was the bad guy, but I saw this thing on the Discovery channel this morning that was debating on whether or not he was a hero or whether he was outgunned, outmanned and outmanuevered....   The people doing the program decided on the latter and I was hooked on it for an hour....Luckily I had nothing else planned...  Lastly, immature attitudes....  I ran into a guy I dig at Walmart tonight and I couldn't think of a thing to say to him, I was completely tongue-tied it was so horrid!  I got the freakin' head nod, you know the one 'hey I see you, whats up?' head nod....  Worse still I was on the phone with someone and he was wondering what was going on...  Yeah, that was hard to explain...  Anyway thats it for now....  Laters.

      I started the Indiana Jones trilogy today...  A friend of mine told me something about the Temple of Doom (that Dan Akroyd had a cameo) and I wasn't sure whether to believe him or not...  So I've watched the majority of the Temple of Doom and sure enough there he is right in the beginning as the British guy at the airport just like Adam said....   I apoligize for doubting you...  :0)  I'm also preregistered for next semester, I've signed up for 16 hours even though I only need 10 to graduate...  I've also decided I dislike Amazon.com, I was supposed to get some books I ordered at the beginning of last week and I was supposed to get them on Friday, but its Monday and they're still not here...  Argh...  At least there's only 2 weeks until I get to go home...  :0)  Whoo hoo, go me!  Other stuff: Jack Ingram's new CD comes out Tuesday though I'm probably going to wait till my birthday to get it...  Honeybrowne's new CD comes out at the end of the month, thats also going to be a birthday present.  I found out Bleu Edmondson is going to be at the Sidecar Pub the night before I leave Houston to come back up here...  I'm probably going to go its just I'll have to leave early, cause that place is all the way out off 290....  And I have to drive 10 hours the next day...  Also since I started thinking about me being nice vs. me joking too much/teasing too much, and I've decided that I'm sticking with that old adage, "If you can't say something nice don't say anything...."  Though I have to admit I even have certain expressions that people can read easily that tease almost better than if I had verbalized it...  So yeah, I probably need to work on that as well...  Anyway I have to go do some more homework, so I'll write again laters....

      So this weekend, I have been called mean more times than I can count.  Now I don't know if its just me being overly sensitive or a fact.  Though if it is fact, that just scares the everloving shite out of me since I've always been the 'nice' girl....  Even when I was working retail and for the last few monthes I couldn't stand it, and got a little cynical, even then I was STILL a 'nice' girl.  So have my jokes suddenly gotten more abrasive or what, but I think I need to work on being more sensitive overall.  I've always needed to work on that, but I'm getting better at it I think...  An early New Year's resolution if you will.  I heard a good thing this weekend too, if you're upset, sad, angry whatever, just write it down and let it go.  Sort of like a catharsis, ya know?  I think thats a good way to think of this blog thingy... In other news, I think I've decided that this will be my way of updating my friends on what's going on in my life, how I feel that sort of thing....  Course I need to email all the ones that I can email and all that good stuff, but I'll get that done... Just like the article review thats due tommorrow by 4, that I haven't written, but have found an article for...  Hmmm, lets see what else....  I've been feeling very festive lately, Christmasy even....  I've been listening to Christmas carols, watched a Christmas movie and found myself on the way to a test on Friday humming Christmasy music....  But then I've sort of been ready for Christmas since like June or July...  Go me, huh?  The countdown to Christmas for those wondering is 46 days...  27 days until I turn 24 (December 6th for those planning on getting me something), 18 till Thanksgiving, and 16 days until I go home for Turkey Day...  And yes I counted twice just to make sure....  Also turns out I nixed 2 weeks of school without realizing it when I was planning out the rest of the semester....  I thought Thanksgiving was week after next and there was another between Thanksgiving and Christmas break...  I'm only a little crazy I swear!  :0)  Anyway I'm off to bed, would anyone care to join me?  ;0)  Laters!

      Okay I have nothing original to say today, so here are a bunch of quotes.....  "Do not meddle in the affairs of dragons, for you are crunchy and  taste good with ketchup."  "...I was going to tell you, but I never had the courage...I always  dreamed of the moment though. I'd take you aside so we could be alone, hold your hands in mine, and we'd stare deep into each other's eyes... Then I'd tell you how i felt; that I'm in love with you... We'd move closer  together...Then we'd kiss... You'd break the silence  by saying "I love you too"... Then we'd kiss again...But, it was only a dream...Then we said good bye, it was over just like that... It wasn't meant to end this way..."  "The statistics on sanity are that one out of every four Americans are suffering from some form of mental illness. Think of your three best  friends. If they're okay, then it's you." Rita Mae Brown.  "Time is not a factor in love because love is timeless..."  "To trust is to unshield your heart and place a dagger in the hand of another"- Shediandi  "Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change,  The courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to hide the bodies of those I had to kill because they pissed me off."  "A girl and a guy can be just friends, but at one point or another  they will fall for each other. Maybe temporarily, maybe at the wrong time, maybe too late, or maybe forever..."  "Love is...Running into his arms, Colliding with his heart, And  Exploding into his soul."  "Don't play leapfrog w/ unicorns..."  "It hurts to love and not be loved - It hurts more to love and not be  able to tell..."  (the story of my life)

      More quotes...  "How can you be friends with someone if everytime you look at them, it  Makes you want them even more?"  "Life is like the mail...sometimes you just don't get it."  "You don't know how hard it is to get over you when every time I see  you my heart begins to smile." (how true is this, for at least one guy I know...)  "Sometimes reality doesn't live up to my dreams."  And lastly one that sums up my entire high school career...  "Everyday before school I try and look my best, but then I come to  school and see all the rest,they are beautiful and popular,the exact opposite of me,but I hope that you can love me for what I can be."  Thats it for today....  Laters....

      Okay, so much for saying I was going to do this every day...  It dawns on me I just don't have that sort of time, unless I cut out a bit more sleep or don't eat, or something equally stupid...    At least I try to get it done every day and its the thought that counts right?  Besides, what if nothing happens to me one day, or I have nothing interesting to say?  Like that could happen I know...  But I'm only saying what if, not actually saying it happens...  Even my dreams are interesting, and not always in a sexual content, to the surprise of many I know...  One odd dream I had the other night was that I was in a plane crash and I was in denial that the plane was actually crashing...   That was a bit strange to say the least....  Oh, by the way I told mom about dropping that math class and she was very matter of fact, if a little dissappointed about it, but understanding at the same time...  Very cool of her I think...  Let's see what else?  A few new crushes...  Though one or 2 are reruns of the same old thing...  Its vicious cycle, but I've seen them more in the last week than I have in the past 2 monthes, and physically and personality wise they're both very much my type...  Both from Texas...  As are all my new crushes...    One old crush that has sorta been revived is a guy I haven't seen in forever by a dream I had about him a couple of weeks ago, how insane is that?  Hmm let's see what else?  I spent about an hour scanning pictures into my computer and putting them into my Yahoo briefcase picture folder thingy...  I ordered some stuff off of Amazon.com, waiting for it to.. uh.... get here...  Yeah, get here thats it...  :0)  My exroomie Mel is in town for the weekend and we're just hanging out and stuff, we just got back from the coffeehouse and we're about to watch 40 days and 40 nights for the umpteenth time (at least on my part, seeing as to how I OWN the darn thing...).  Thats about it for now...  Laters...

      Well, I finally did it....  I dropped my stupid, unneeded math class...  I'm down to 12 hours from 15, but it doesn't effect my graduating in May...  Dumb thing didn't even count toward anything!!!  Except my GPA and more hours towards graduation....  I only need like 7 hours overall and 10 upper level hours to graduate so fuck it...  Speaking of fuck...  (Sorry just finished reading Scott Copelands thoughts so I'm in a bit of a cursing mood...)  I can't fucking believe I was having sex dreams about the professor....  I mean he has to be mid 40s, balding, and bookish, thats just sort of disturbing.  Oh, and also disturbing is the fact I can't quit thinking of all the ways I'd like to kill the dumbass muthafucka old ass German who made me ashamed to BE German for 2 seconds (then I got my Irish up :0) ) that thought he was God's gift to women, human and animal alike (ew)...  He was almost 50, hadn't taken a shower since Lord only knows when, scraggly hair and beard, beer gut and HE COULDN'T HOLD HIS LIQUIOR!!!!  He had like two beers and he was gone...  I mean, Gawd I don't drink that often and I have a far superior alcohol tolerance...  Hell, a freshman on orientation weekend has a better alcohol tolerance than he did!  Anyway enough about that dirty old man...  Stupid ass perv tried to follow me to my room after I laughed at his asinine remark about following me to bed...  Good thing I'm a paranoid city girl and I'd locked the door, he tried to jiggle the handle and THEN tapped on the door...  I was on the phone with a friend of mine and I was trying not to kick his ass out of MY house, only the fact that he had an adorable Rott puppy saved his wrotten hide....  ANYWAY thats really all on him....  Speaking of puppies... Mine would have been 15 today if she was still alive...  That'd be one old lady, at least in dog years....  People age, she'd be getting her driving permit...  hehehe, an apricot toy poodle behind the wheel, how hilarious is that?  :0)  Let's see what else?  Oh, yeah my New Year's plans have been firmed up a little more (at least more than they were) and I'll be at the Firehouse watching Bleu Edmondson (sigh), Stoney Larue, and Wade Bowen & West 84, drinking champagne... feeling no pain till early morning...  Dining and dancing with every pretty boy (even though they're trouble) I can find......  I just got an email my test at 10 in the morning is canceled, which is a good thing cuz I'd actually forgotten I'd even HAD a test....  Not a good thing I know...  At least now I can go get the oil changed on my 4runner and flirt with the cute boys at the Castro place...  :0)  Anyway I'm off to bed cuz for some reason I can't stay up past 1 anymore...  How horrible is that?  :0)  Neway night and I'll talk more smack about people laters......  :0)

      Wow its been a while since I've done this...  A week and a half to be precise...  Gracious, all the things that have happened this week!  Or should I things that HAVEN'T occurred this week?  Well lets see the day after my last post (Thursday) I went home to Houston....  Friday and Saturday, shopped, Sunday came back to Clarksvegas after a brief stop at my local Krispy Kreme shop for a dozen to go....  (Gawd those are so my weakness!  And oh so bad for my hips and tummy...)  I had class all week...  2 tests, one on Tuesday and one Friday...  Halloween was fun, I went as a pirate chick, sword and all....  Amanda and I went to the dance for a bit, there were at least 4 other pirate chicks, and one pirate, none of which had a sweet sword like me...  We then proceeded to Shanghai my other friend Matt into going to Dodge's and Walmart with us..  You know out of the 5 or 6 Matts I've ever met, he's the only one that's not trouble with a capital T-R-O-U-B-L-E....  And I've finally learned my lesson, NO MORE MATTS!!!  Alas I had to do it the hard way and date 2, but learn I have...  NEway, today I relaxed, slept late, went to Russellville to go to Hastings came back and went to see Brother Bear...  You know going to a movie on a date night when your single by yourself is rather liberating...  No arguing about who pays, no awkward conversation, and trying to slip away from grabby hands....  Course that last one is only if you dont like them...  :0)  Oh, one thing I did want to mention, I had a dream about a guy the other night (surprise surprise I know) one whom I've known most of my life and had a crush on on and off all through it...  At one point in time I thought I was in love with him...  I haven't seen him in a couple of years, since the last time I went to see him play at Fitz's I think, but every now and then I'll hear a little  something through my sister or my best friend....  Yeah anyway had a dream about him, nothing sexual, more comforting than anything else, though I only remember scraps and pieces of it....  This got me to thinking, not obsessing, just thinking...  I used to think he was the perfect man and there was just a sense of rightness there, though that was probably one sided just like my thinking I loved him....  What a silly teenager I was...  But then again aren't they all?  :0)  But there are still certain characteristics I look for in people overall and in potential boyfriends that belong to him, though not solely...  Why did he have to go around and start kissing boys in clubs?  Out of all the people in our senior class I never thought he'd be one of the ones to come out of the closet...  Though, there were a few others that have since that I sorta always thought might be...  At least 2 I know of for sure...  NEway enuff about high school it wasn't great, college is all right, and real life should get even better....  hehehe...  Laters...

      So, we just got back at about 5 or so from being in Brownwood....  For those that don't know where that is...  Its like 2 hours west of Austin, sort of near Abilene and Stephenville....  I have a grandmother, both aunts, various cousins and their children (also my cousins) all there...  The rest are mainly around San Antonio...  The branch that isn't quite so....  Crazy....  :0)  Thats a good word for what they all are.  People ask why I'm completely insane....  Well, just take a good look at my family....  All smokers, a few in and out of jail, all married young, with kids no less....  To top all that off that ask me why I'M not married with kids.....  Yeah, after all the sucess and bad marriages they have from marrying so young, having no jobs, and being a chain smoker, as well as being obsesely overweight...   Yeah, I want to be part of my family...  Don't you?  :0)  We left Houston Saturday and came home today and I'm doing a few loads of laundry just to get the smell of smoke off my clothes...  We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express and yet still somehow all my clothes reek of smoke....  So yeah, I gots to do some laundry...  :0)  The trip itself wasn't that bad, I love traveling with my mom and sisters usually, but all we did when we got there was sit around a smoke filled house, kids underfoot, and talk BS all 3 days we were there (mostly repeating myself about why I WASN'T married or having kids like it was going out of style....)....   Well 2 for Lauren and Lindsay, since somehow they got to leave yesterday, I still don't know...  Then my mom invited over my cousin Matthew's oldest daughter, Cheyenne, who is 6 years old and a pistol....  She's so outgoing its crazy!!!  Random people at McDonalds she was like,  "Hey, excuse me, ma'am, but I know you from somewhere.  What's your name?"  And it usually turned out she did...  Strange, I don't remember ever being that outgoing....   So she spent the night with us and proceeded to wake me up about every 2 hours by smacking me in the face with a hand...  Of course she didn't mean to, but it still bugged me...   I guess I just started to loose my patience with her after being around her and 5 other kids all day....  That and an indecent night of sleep had me rethinking my future plans, top that off with how inadiquate my mom can make me feel without even meaning to...  Yeah, not a good night all in all....  We finally left around 1 ish today....  I still want to be a teacher of course cuz I mean I still love kids, but I know I'm really not ready to be a parent yet...  Good thing I didn't plan to be one for at least 5 years.....  :0)  Anyway thats about it for now....  My dryer just went off and GWE Radio is about to come to the end of Shot full of holes....  :0)  O, real quick...  I got my family into Doug Moreland over the weekend (his humor is right up there alley) and one of my step uncles is a musician and is planning to play one of Doug's songs at one of his gigs...  Kinda kewl I thought.... NEway laters!

      All my Christmas shopping is done!  Whoo hoo!  This has been the most stress free holiday season I think I've ever had...  Well, with the exception of the traffic...  Every single one of my shortcuts back to Mom's house had traffic!!!  How could they?  :p  I got all my presents, Mom's, Lauren's and Lindsay's in only 2 days...  I think that's some sort of record!  Lauren's present I got to go back to Cactus Records for...  I'll take any excuse to got there and look around and/or buy stuff...  I also found Finding Nemo at Best Buy.  Its on DVD, but its still Finding Nemo!  Hehehe...  Only thing I don't have that I'm not getting until after Christmas is my cell phone...  :0)  Tonight Mom is taking us all to the ballet, its the Nutcracker I think...  God, I haven't been to the ballet in...  Years....  But yeah, all my presents are bought and have been wrapped.... So Christmas is definately going to be off the hook!  Uh, I mean, going to rock... Or something...  I've been listening to too much rap here lately...  Neway I'm off to try and get ready for tonight, Mom wants us all ready to eat at 6 and ready to leave at 6:45...  Doubtful, but we'll see...  Laters.

      Its Monday, Houston, and here's what's not in today's Chronicle ..  I should know I just got done looking at it...  :0)  So, Monday...  No longer a day from hell with classes from 10 - 8 at night...  Its a nice, nice thing....  I still haven't done any Christmas shopping, though its on my list of stuff to do today and tommorrow...  I know exactly what I'm getting for Mom and Lauren, but Lindsay's an unknown at the moment....  And I get to go get all my presents....  Hehehe...  I'm going to Cingular tommorrow to look at new phones and see if I can find one with a camera in it, you knwo one of those cool flip ones that you can take pictures with?  That would be awesome...  :0)  So, I'm off to eat lunch... And maybe I'll be nice and unlaid the dishwasher too while I'm in the kitchen....   Then to Highland Village and Best Buy...  And if I have time maybe even the Galleria *gasp egads*...   I know its completely insane to go 3 days b4 Christmas, but I haven't seen the tree yet and I haven't been there since...  I think the last time I was home in October or did I go over T-day break?  I'm not sure...  But anyway I'm off to eat and try to find Finding Nemo  again  .....  Who'da thunk it'd be so hard to find???  I was at 3 different places where I can usually find it no problem....  No luck at all...  Of course this may become a trend...  Me wanting something thats hard to find for Christmas that is, not going 3 different places...   That's everyday type stuff...  :0)  Last year it was a digital camera, this year its Finding Nemo, whats up for next year?  Neway thats it for now!  Laters....

      So I got back to Houston safely and soundly...  Though exhausted as usual...  :0)  Soooo, Honeybrown at the Firehouse is so not going to happen...  Sorry, Fred, next time...  ;0)  I started out this morning at about 8:30 after a long, drawn out good bye to Heather, who won't be living with us since she had to go and graduate, the punk...  We did find a new roomie however so they can't kick us out of the house like they were threatening to this week....  But Heather will be back...  She still has to finish her grammar tests....  :0)  Last night, Ana, Mel, Heather, Elizabeth (a friend of Ana's), and I went to see Mona Lisa Smile...  A very cute movie, though not sure if I liked the ending...  Then we went home and packed, me for coming home, Heather for moving out...  Of course I overpacked as usual, and Heather got little to no packing done, also the usual...  :0)   I did have an interesting thought in the car, weird and kind of obscure, but interesting nonetheless....  Who decided that when horseback riding you had to mount on the left side?  Why not the right?  Is it because most of the world is right handed and therefore left brained?  I don't know...   Also passed over a creek in East Texas that made me think of O'Neal...  Peach Creek...  I had to call Heather and Amanda and tell them, it was hilarious...  :0)   Also while I was driving home today, I noticed how many out of state plates there were...  Not just in Arkansas, but in Texas too...  Weird places like Maryland, Virginia, and places as close as Tennessee, New Mexico, and Louisana...  Even a couple from Michigan of all places!  I know its winter, but aren't all the snowbirds already here?  Oh, wait it may be cuz Christmas is this week...  Doh...  :0) So I got back about 6:30 tonight, talked to mom and Linz for while, ate dinner with mom and John and they're currently watching Pirates of the Caribbean....  Meanwhile I'm contemplating either going to bed (even though its only 9 at night) or unpacking the rest of my car....  Need to do the later in order to do the former, so I had best get with it...  O...  Also I get my bedroom...  At least for tonight...  Since Lauren gets back tomorrow... And as we all know she   is   the boss of all of us....  :0)  Anyway I'm off...  Laters....

      So Finals are almost over....  One more day...  Two more tests...  Well actually only one and a half..  One at 9 on vocabulary and applications of stuff and a take home to finish by 2...  I'm doing pretty good I think....  Saturday I go home (whoo hoo).  Honeybrown's playing at the Firehouse Saturday night, though I seriously doubt I'll make it...  Let's see...  Aside from Finals my life is relatively boring at the moment...  Sunday morning I'll wake up in my own bed...  Well, techincally the sofa sleeper... Unless Lauren comes home Sunday instead of Saturday in that case I WILL wake up in my own bed...  Whoo hoo...  :0)  Laters.

      Well, its Sunday night and I'm still recuperating from the weekend...  No, no drunken stupors or passing out in ditches this time...  :0)  Friday night it snowed...  Not just a little...  Like a downpour for a couple of hours...  There were a couple of inches that actually stuck to the ground no less...  Heather, and I were hanging out with Mel and Ana and watching movies in the living room when it began....  Then it turned to rain and that was the end of that.... Mel and Ana spent the night even though they only live across campus, it was fun...  Its been awhile since I've been to a sleep over...  Co-ed, girls, whatever....  Saturday, we all went lingerie shopping with Heather, since she's getting married next summer and before she left next week she wanted to get a bunch of girls' opinions on what she should get...  We spent almost 3 hours there and she wound up registered there too...  Just think what'll happen when I get married, 2 words, Victoria's Secret....  Ah, I need to go shopping....  :0)  Saturday night we went to James', this time it was Heather, Amanda, Matt and I to go hot tubbing...  Fun stuff, hot tob in the middle of the winter...  It was great except the getting in and out part...  :0)  Then we stayed up most of the night watching movies with the help of James' parents' digital cable....  I got to watch Animal Planet for the first time in 2 weeks....  It was very, very nice...  We left about 10 or so this morning and got home about 10:30ish...  I got a couple more hours of sleep, Amanda went to work and Heather's been working on homework...  So I supposed you could say I've had two sleep overs this weekend after a long dry spell...  Cuz technically when Peaches comes over it doesn't count, since we seem to stay up all night...  Sleep overs are only sleep overs if more than 2 people sleep... :0) Finals start tommorrow...  I have two tommorrow (One at 11 and 6) and two on Friday (one at 9 and the other at 2) and I'm debating on whether or not I want to go to Ft. Worth after my last final on Friday and stay with Lauren and go home Saturday or just go home Saturday...  Lauren's leaving Saturday so it'd be cool either way...   Last night before we left I was watching TV and I came across CRL on GAC and Pat Green was on...  I watched that for a while (i only caught the last 15 minutes) and it dawns me...  Texas music is taking over the world...  *evil laugh*  Last week Charlie Robison's song 'Right Man For The Job' was used as one of the background songs(you know the ones that play in the background while stuff is going on on the TV show) on MTV for that show One Bad Trip...  Before that, Nashville singers were getting material from Texas songwriters....  And 2 words....  Dixie Chicks....  Natalie's dad is a major producer for many Texas musicians, as well as being a musician himself...  So yeah, look out its coming at ya, live and local..  And it doesn't cost an arm and a leg to get into a concert, at least not usually...  :0)  Thats about it 4 now.  Laters...

      Ever since I saw Trista and Ryan's Wedding last night I haven't been able to quit thinking about weddings....  Well, actually this has been going on a while...  I used to be addicted to Wedding Story on TLC, and one of my roommates is getting married to her boyfriend of the last 5 years next summer, so I hear alot of wedding stuff from that quarter...  I pretty much have chosen, my dress, rings (engagement and wedding band), colors (though they vary every couple of days), kind of have chosen the location, whose going to perform the ceremony, only thing missing is the groom...   I don't really want to get married any time soon (least not for a year or 2 and no kids for another year or 2)...  Is this my biological clock's way of telling me to get my butt in gear and search for Mr. Right more in depth?  Not that I haven't searched and kissed alot of frogs....  ALOT of frogs actually...    NEwho I guess I'll eventually figure it out...  One day after all my finals that is, until then I have more than enough stress...  Laters....

      Well, its a good thing I didn't go to Fayetteville last night, as much as I adore Bleu Edmondson and Cross Canadian Ragweed....  It freakin' snowed!!!  Sure it was only flurries that didn't stick to the ground here, but school was canceled for a friend of mine who lives just a little north of Fayetteville...  So, yea, it must have been pretty bad...  Its just it was cold, wet and I hate to drive at night, as well as it was a town I didn't know and a bar I'd never been to, so yeah, not gonna happen...  So I went to the poetry thing instead at the coffeehouse...  Dillon wasn't there, so I couldn't flirt shamelessly...  He did tell me though last time I talked to him he was still 2 hours short of graduating and he's taking summer school, so he'll still be here next semester.... Heck, he considers himself a townie now, so yeah...  Anyway last night after the poetry was over this guy, Brandon, I'm only sort of acquainted with (hes a sophmore and hes always at these things and he's into Pat Green like me....  Though unlike me he can play guitar....  But anyway some random guy wanted to meet me adn since he looked like he wasn't even out of high school yet, I shot him down gently...  Made like I just had to leave in order for my roomie to go do her homework and couldn't talk....  A very nice brush off but a brush off nonetheless...  I don't think Brandon knows how old I actually am or else I don't think he would have tried that....  :0)  Or if he knew my no townies rule (unless its Peaces or Dillon), as I haven't had any luck with them, nor do I want to...  :0)   I've also rediscovered an old, not so great, habit.  Though I did find out something about myself to be proud of too.  I found that no matter who asks me, or what it is being asked about, for some reason I just can't say no...  That has the potential to get me into a lot of trouble...  It has before and it will again, but for now its under control...  But the good thing, on the other hand...  I discovered I can stand up to my mother without sounding like a smart ass or immature....  I can make my point in defense of myself without sounding irrational...  Kind of kewl if ya ask me....  :0) Anyway I think I'm off to bed...  I have to get up early and get some more hours at the daycare down the street...  Laters....

      Ok, so I fell asleep ungodly early last night....  During Jay Leno's monologue, if that tells you anything....  I woke up to Unsolved Mysteries and changed it to Winnie the Pooh cause Unsolved Mysteries freaks me out whether I'm awake or half asleep...  Then I saw another episode this afternoon while eating lunch....  That got me thinking about my friend, Steve....  Well, I think he's still my friend since we haven't spoken in monthes, but that's just how our relationship since 98, at least, seems to work...  Neway, he always compared himself to Tigger, which I thought was cute....  But now, years later, I can definately see the resemblance...  Thinking about Steve got me thinking about this one particular Christmas carol....  Its to the tune of Walking in a Winter Wonderland, its called Walking 'round in Women's Underwear...  Very cute song....  Newho, I was going to go to Fayetteville tonight buthave changed my mind for the millionth time since hearing about it....  Actaully the weather changed it for me....  Rain, cold and dark, not my favorite combo to drive in even for Bleu Edmondson...  :0)  Oh, yea, and Cross Canadian Ragweed, too...  But mainly Bleu....  :0)  Oh, well, I'll see him New Years, if not b4....  So I guess I'm going to the WA Press thingy tonight instead....  At least there I can flirt with Dillon...  A little at least...   hehehe...  Let's see what else is occuring?  O, yes, since yesterday was the day from Hell, with all the stress and the work and the rushing to get things done and turned in and the screaming and the moaning that was done I figured I could take today off from work of any sort....  Though I didn't sleep late, didn't have classes, and only had to call someone to tell her I wouldn't be in her office for our appointment at 2:30 as I usually was....  Its been great so far but I need a back rub like no one's business....   Let's see....  Oh, yes, my major complaint about women....  I know I am one,  but I was ashamed to admit it last night when I witnessed one of the worst travesties ever on television...  I recently (like 3 weeks ago) got addicted to this show the Average Joe, where this chick, Miss Missouri, Melana, picks form a lot of 'average' kinda guys....  Plot twist occuring when 3 'hot' guys are thrown in the mix...  Though some of the average guys were attractive and 2 of the hot guys were just...  ew...  The third guy (and one of Melana's final 2) Jason seemed like the average guy to me....  Though he seemed absurdly laid back (some of my best friends are the stereotypical surfer 'dudes' and even THEY'RE not this laid back) and he looked like he was fake and baked (i.e. self tanner and/or tanning booth)...  While the other guy Adam, was decent looking, funny, always smiling, successful, and treated her like a princess...  Well, Miss Melana in her infinite wisdom picked Jason, the student/waiter, who she had immediate chemistry with and enjoyed kissing, and not much else....  Adam on the other hand enjoyed a friendship with her, romanced her, and they both implied a future together (i.e. having kids together, moving to the same city....).  So I thought Adam was a shoe in, since everyone knows good relationships are based on friendships...  Chemistry is nice I know, but it can fizzle out quickly if there isn't any sort of foundation to back it up...  And to top it off Jason, the winner (as much as I hate to call him that), came out and shook Adam's hand and then Adam got on the bus and Melana and Jason started to make out, while Adam was still there and could see them through the window of the bus, how inconsiderate is that???? Anyway....  Trista and Ryan's wedding is on on Wednesday and at least I know that will end better....  Shoot its pretty much a guarentee that it will end better....   Laters.....

      Happy Birthday to me happy birthday to me....  Well, okay maybe not today, but yesterday....  But I claim the whole month as mine gosh darnit...  :0)  If Mom can claim the entire month of February on the basis of having a birthday at the end of the month, why can't I do the same in the beginning of the month?  Its not like I don't know someone with a birthday almost every other day from last Friday to January the 12th...  So I can*throat clearing*  help  them celebrate, so to speak...  :0)  But anywho, I don't feel any older, I feel just the same as I have all the rest of the year....  Of course most birthdays I usually don't feel my age till the middle of the next year (July - ish), so we'll see...  Man a quarter of a century old....  First time I heard that I was like, that's old....  Now I'm like thats just funny....  Its like time goes on and theres nothing you can do to stop it and when you reach certain points in like (i.e. mile markers in life - 16, 18, 21, 25, 30, 40, 50, etc.....) certain things are supposed to happen and have been done...  I'm a bit behind in that I'm not out of college but by gummi beary I will be in May....  But I'll catch up quickly...  Though I'm not planning to get married till a whole lot closer to 30 than I am now...  Unless something completely unforseen, like Mr. Right, comes along, in that case I'll make an exception...  Though whose to say he hasn't already and the timing hasn't been right?  Ok, this is beginning to sound too much like the blog about soulmates a few weeks ago...  So what did I do for my big 2 - 5, you may ask?  It was rather dull actually...  Slept late, ate lunch, showered, went shopping at the new Hastings in Russellville, picked up dinner at the Cracker Barrel, and came home to a little bit of a surprise party....  A few friends had come over and as soon as I walked in the door confetti was thrown at me, birhtday wishes shouted, and clothes taken off (ok so not the last but got your attention didn't I?)....  We had birthday cake, the thing looked like a torch with all the candles on it, but I got it all in one breath....  Hehehe....  I guess the older I get the more hot air I'm filled with?  hehehehe....  Watched tv, went to the coffee house, came back watched most of Pirates of the Carribbean b4 going to bed....  So it was almost your average Clarksvegas Saturday night....  Almost, but not quite...  :0)  Also I found out that there's a WA Press (a poetry thing) Tuesday night when I want to go to Fayetteville....  So Decisions must be made....  But I'll worry about that tommorrow (isn't that so Scarlett O'Hara of me?)....  That's about it for now....  Laters....

      Well, I got more birthday stuff today...  A package from mom, with a couple of birthday presents (baseball caps I wanted) and O'Neill promptly tried to steal one...  Silly boy...  I also went to Walmart tonight and got cake mix, icing and candles for the big day...  Still don't know what I'm doing, aside from going to Hastings...  Might go the the play, Peter Pan, here on campus, not sure yet....  I don't know if we're going to the Winter Formal tomorrow night either...  It doesn't even really seem worth it...  Went to the Halloween dance and knew like a handful of people and dance like 2 or 3 times....  So yeah, not really sure if its worth getting all fancy smancy in order to only go for like 15 minutes...  When I could spend quality time getting drunk and watching Pirates of the Carribean, yet again...  Oh, or I could go to see Haunted Mansion since I have that free ticket from buying the Pirates DVD...  Hmm, let's see what else?  Have two or 3 major things due Monday so tommorrow (Friday) and Sunday are going to be devoted to getting those done...  Cuz Lord knows I won't get any of it done Saturday...  I'm also debating on whether or not to go to Fayetteville on Tuesday, Bleu's opening for Cross Canadian Ragweed and I want to see them both, but I don't know it just depends on a bunch of stuff...  That's about it for now I suppose....  Laters....

      Ok, so this week has been incredibly, insanely stressful beyond belief....  Not as bad as last Monday, but its getting there...  It seems as if everything that my professors want turned in is due between today and Monday...  Its insanity I tell ya, pure insanity....  :0)  Anyway, Saturday's my 25th birthday, and I still have no definite plans yet..  I got my first birthday cards from my aunt and grandmother....  I talked to mom tonight and she said she was sending me some 'stuff' and she wouldn't elaborate, and usually you can't shut her up, so I know something's up and its probably something for my birthday...  Which would be pretty darn sweet...  :0)  25...  Man, that's a fourth of a century old....  I've been working with a girl who is 7 years old, it turns out that she was born on my mom's birthday my sophmore year of high school....  I suddenly felt very old...  But I'm over that now, so its all good...   I don't feel as bad as I did about graduating so far out of high school since I found out last week that another guy O graduated with is graduating in May too, that made me feel tremendously better...  He took off a bit more time than I did, but still he graduated in 97 like me and hes graduatuing in 04 like me, so its all good...  :0)  In other news we started decorating the house on Sunday and we're still working on it...  Perhaps by the time we go home for the break it'll be done...  :0)  I also bought Pirates of the Carribean yesterday and proceeded to watch it for like the 4th time...  At the moment I'm about half way through the bonus features (that alone took an hour)....  There was also a voucher to see The Haunted Mansion free...  Pretty sweet deal...  :0)  Thats about all for now, unless I write about my obsession with certain reality tv shows that all end next week...  Sux to be me, huh?  Laters....

      " Education makes people easy to lead, but difficult to drive;easy to govern, but impossible to enslave. " - Henry Peter Broughan  Or   "The greatest glory consists not in falling, but rising every time we fall."  - Anon.  That second one I especially like just for its inspiration factor.    So yesterday morning and Tueday morning I woke up to Pat Green, pretty sweet deal...  I was wondering how that could be and when I woke up this morning I hear that its a university run radio station and from 6 to noon it only plays Americana.  Go U of O!  :0)  COurse the fact most of the kids here if they're not from Central America or Arkansas are from Texas (mostly Dallas) so I really shouldn't be surprised...  Yet, I am....  :0) So night b4 last Amanda and I were watching Free Willy 2 (it was the only thing on TV, so sue me!) and towards the end we were discussing how it seemed like Willy never got hurt, regardless of what he did...  This started a discussion about Superman and how he never got hurt.  So I bust out with the Super Willy and we started giggling like mad women....  Kelpt that up for the rest of the movie...  Earlier that day I'd been talking to a friend of mine about a professor (whose been wheel chair bound since college due to polio) and we kept looking around, since we were about 200 yards away from her office, and JC (also in a wheelchair) said I hope Dr. ____ doesn't walk in. He caught himself and we looked at each other and bust a gut... So yeah Tuesday was a good day for laughs...  :0) Right as I went to bed last night I started thinking...  There are companies that make radios that only play soothing sounds that help you sleep and I was wondering if they made one that had 'Sounds of the City'....  I doubt it seriously, but its weird not being in a big city sometimes, especially since mom moved so close to downtown and I hear them more ofter than usual...  Oh, well, I'll live....  Just going to have to fall asleep with the TV on low volume as usual....  Thats about it for this afternoon...  I'm off either to Walmart, nap, or do laundry....  Lucky me....  Laters.

      I read in Galleywinter that someone’s cat died today and there was this awesome outpouring of sympathy and support for him.  That to me was just amazing.  Made me wish that I had found Galleywinter when Tiffy died 2 and half years ago.  Then again I might not have been able to do much productivity wise, shoot I couldn’t have I know.  I was barely able to pack and I don’t remember anything between the day she died what happened after we buried her and the next week when I went back to school (I know I packed up my car, drove 10 hours, unpacked my car and got stuff out of storage).  I don’t know what else happened that week.  In fact I really don’t remember getting registered and going to class, but I know I did it.  I don’t remember much until the first weekend back when I broke down on Heather’s couch.  It’s not just my horrible memory, I really, REALLY don’t remember what happened.  I was in shock, I was in denial and I was blaming everyone.  She was 12 years old, I shouldn’t have been surprised but there is NO way to prepare for death.  Sure she had been sick, but that doesn’t guarantee death.  If it did I’d be dead a million times over…  :0)  Between the acid reflux, playing hooky, injuries, and cramps, that’s got to be a good 2 dozen times…  Not including all the times I came close, being an accident-prone child (and yet I never broke any bones! Mainly it was stuff like skinned knees, sprained joints, pulled muscles… Pretty sure I tore something in my knees but it doesn’t bug me too often so I don’t sweat it…).  But I was also a tomboy, which might have contributed to that…  :0) Oh, I figured out why I like Sharon Osborne today!  She reminds me of my best friend’s mom…  Whose like my 2nd mom…  Except Sharon’s a bit more out there than Mrs. T….  :0)  Ms. T. is the way with Disney the way Sharon is with dogs...  She also loves to talk in that baby talk voice, which may contribute to why watching Sharon, makes it a bit like home, with an English accent...  :0)Neway thats about it 4 now...  Laters...

      I woke up thinking this morning and I couldn't go back to bed.  For some reason I couldn't get it out of my head...  Ok, enough with the rhyming stuff...  So yeah I did wake up thinking about some stuff...  Someone told me last week that I shouldn't base my opinions/politics on stuff my dad believed and after going through a very thorough 12 step program (or not) I agree.  So I go to thinking where do I stand (insert ye olde country song "You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything" by Aaron Tippin) on certain political issues...  So I came up with a little listypoo...  1.  I'm Pro-Choice (always have been) 2.  Bush sucks, I don't care if he is from Texas, he's just a good ol' boy trying toprove to his dad he can do it, too.  Sure he handled things after 9-11 admirably, but I still don't see the connect bewteen Osama (who is still on the loose) and Saddam. 3.  The U.S. should take care of its own business before trying to stick our noses in other people's bidness.  It's arrogant and Godlike and its wrong. 4.  More money should be taken from other programs and put into education (this could also be 3 B) and other programs geared toward children.  This is not because I plan to be a teacher, but also because teachers get little respect as people tend to misinterupt their job descriptions.  Being a teacher is not a 40 hour a week, 9 month a year job.  Most vacations are spent in workshops and lesson planning, and constructing units that will be interesting to children, as well as maintaining their classrooms (i.e. bulletin boards, arranging furniture, etc.) and also put a good chunk of their own cash into making said classrooms better and more comfortable for students. 5.  I believe in protecting the environment but not at the expense of the economy (does that make any sense?). Cows are good, mad cow disease is bad....  What possessed people to feed animals other animals of the same species?  That's just cannibalism and humans don't have the most glowing resume for that....  If it affects humans that way, don't ya think it will animals too? 6.  Recycling is good and I try to do it. 7.  In no way I am I treehugging, PETA loving, Greenpeace wannabe. 8.  I am a liberal Democratic who is open to new ideas and enjoys learning new things.    And this last one isn't so much a political thing so much a thing about myself in general...  I will always be an idealistic optimistic wench...  Sure there were about 3 monthes of working retail where I wasn't but out of 13 monthes, you're bound to have some times you don't like your job...  Also if you have a correction, different opinion, or just want to bitch at me in general (I can take it believe me) my email address is sunnychic78@yahoo.com. Okay, I'm going to make dinner....  Laters.

      So last night I received my first obscene phone call....  That is my first obscene phone call on my school/land line and it was someone I didn't know...  (yes a few of my friends have done it playfully and vice versa...)  I don't mind, in fact it was rather complimentary to me, once I thought about it.  Of course it was at 4 A.M. so my thinking at the time wasn't real clear...  Let me explain briefly.  About 4ish this morning, my roommate taps on my door, saying the phone had rung and it was for me(waking me from the deep contented slumber where the only reason I would get up would be to go the bathroom).  So I mutter hello (course it sounded more like an incomprehensible 'lo) and the guy on the other end is like "I need some poon tang!!!"  He was drunk and he made another comment about how he had heard I was good in bed in dirty detail...  I simply hung up.  He didn't identify himself, except to rustle some paper by the reciever and stutter his name, which I couldn't hear or process, but I figure it was someone on campus, since my number's in the directory but not the white pages and none of my friends (with the exception of my family) have that number, they all know to call my cell 1st b4 anything else cuz I usually always have it with me...).  So, this afternoon thinking back on it, I'm starting to think that he was complimenting me since I haven't slept with anyone up here in at least 2 years (Slept (James, O'Neal, and them don't count that was simply falling asleep in the same room not full on cuddle fest)OR had sex... I've been keeping a low profile at school).  So yeah this guy saying rumors were floating around about me I choose to take as a positive and not a negative, just becase if I did take it as a negative that just wouldn't be me.  It would also make me really paranoid about being at a small school and knowing how fast and furious and ruthless rumors at this place can be...  So I choose to ignore it and just focus on other stuff.  Besides I'm sure it was a one time deal.  If not then I'll take it up with George or Joe and if I have to President Niece or CPD....  At home I would be really paranoid just cuz Houston isn't known as the safest of places and my attitude there is WAY different than here.  There's only one lock on the door here compare to the 3 at home (WITH a security alarm)...  So yeah, just a tad bit different......  Oh, yeah, and for some reason Galleywinter isn't working tonight, I tried restarting my computer but that didn't help any..  Darnit...  I guess I'll just go to bed then....  Laters!

      So I got back from the movies about an hour or so ago...  Mel and I went to see Win A Date With Tad Hamilton...  A good chick flick, with just the right amount of cheese...  So yeah, classes today, my 11 o'clock got canceled so I only had the 10 and noon...  And I couldn't stop watching the clock...  It is Friday after all.   Yesterday had class till 11 then proceeded to waste 45 minutes of my life in a meeting I didn't need to be in, though I did get to see some people I hadn't seen in a while.  Like since before Christmas....  I got a part in the mail for my computer, since the sound still doesn't work, but its the wrong part so I have to call Dell and bitch at them some more... They sent me a part to go inside the CD ROM and I need a wire for the external hook up.  While I was in the bookstore opening it, Adam thought my package from Airborne Express said ABORTION Express...  Cracked me up beyond belief...  We got to talking and he doesn't remember the last time he saw Peaches, so I'm thinking he's not avoiding me, just doing other stuff (sleeping, smoking, and being a lazy arse sort of things...).  So I may give him a call hasta manana and see if he can fix my 'puter for me....  Then later on in the afternoon, I worked on a bulletin board for Intergrated Methods -Language Arts & Social Studies (one of my ed. classes) with Kristin for almost 2 hours and still didn't finish it till this morning...  She pointed out to me I was wearing my CCRW Got Weed? shirt and later I realized I was ALSO wearing my Miller Lite, Champange of Beers baseball cap.  Then I realized to my growing horror that I had been all day....  To both of my education classes!  What will they think of me as a potential teacher while I go around wearing beer/pot paraphanalia (sp?)?  I guess its a good thing I'm going nontraditional certification and graduating in May...  :0)  NEhow I suppose thats it for this evening...  Laters.

      " The only thing you're perfect at is being yourself ." -  Meghan Barry  Another quote from my daily calendar...  I'm really digging this thing...  It's got tons of stories and quotes and stuff that are funny....  Tommorrow's is Eleanor Roosevelt and I originally heard it in the movie The Princess Diaries....  " No one can make you feel inferior without your consent. "  Another really good one...  :0)  Also very true.  I discovered that the shaving cream I've been using for the last week or so is the same one my dad used to use, while he was still alive.  I don't know how I know it, I just do.  Its like I smelled it and it was familar and I just couldn't place it but today it hit me...  It's Daddy's old shaving cream...  Kind of made me tear up...  But in a good way.  Sort of the way Aramis cologne does...  It's weird even after over 10 years that I can still miss him so much....  Weird, but nice...  I was always a daddy's girl and spoiled to boot...  All my sisters and I had to do was ask with a pout, "Pleeezz, daddy, I neeeeeed this."  And we usually got it.  I can't remember one single occasion where he actually said no to us....  We had 3 dogs at one point cuz he couldn't say no to all of us wanting our own dog....  Mom sort of had to be the disiplinarian and still is to this day, but not nearly so bad as what we thought she was...  No its more like loving guidance with a bit of bossiness thrown in...  All 3 of us got our bossiness from her....  :0)  Let's see.... Guy drama....  Wow, I actually have some!!!  A friend of mine, let's call him person C...  Thinks that Person D (another friend of mine) and I were serious when making sexual innuendo...  Sure we came on a bit strong, but nothing unusual, at least not for me...  :0)  So now person C won't hang out with us any more or at least thats what person D thinks...  I'm not sure myself....  But I'm going to talk to him in the next couple of days and find out for sure, cuz goodness knows I don't need any drama, boy or not in my life...    Thats about it for now.... No wait my Wade Bowen dream!!!  Now, I don't remember all of it but it wasn't at all sexual.  All it was was he and I eating birthday cake...  I don't know whose birthday it was and there was no food fight, but it was sort of weird...  Maybe cuz of that Wave on Wave parody I did last week?  Who knows?  Now thats really it...  Laters.

      So I got my first graduation present today...  Though I don't actually get it till May, I was told its waiting for me...  Mom got me a 1 karat diamond necklace in the shape of a heart at Market in Dallas...  She never got my message about the fake Louis Vuitton, but its all good, she knows I've wanted her necklace for a very, very long time....  So as she said, now she doesn't have to die for me to have it, the one she got is the daughter of hers.   Kind of appropriate since I'm her daughter....    I was watching TV last night and while I was on MTV a preview for 2night's Osbournes (which I completely missed) came on and Ozzy was talking about having a hobby.  He was like, "Sharon, you buy dogs as your hobby.  I want to buy a gun...  Then you can buy the dogs and I can shoot them...."  Or something along those lines.  Now I love dogs, but the way Ozzy said and the fact it was Ozzy that said it, made it hilarious....    I was at Walmart earlier and of all the things I could possibly find, I found Mom's brand of Tofu pups (meatless hotdogs) and I almost bust a gut when I saw the Walmart version of the 'health food section'...  Some mushrooms, lots of Tofu and tofu products, and some salsa and guacamole...  Though I'm not sure who those last two are health food...  Anyone?   Bueller?  Bueller?  Anyway thats about it for now... Laters.

      So I've watched Amistad in honor of MLK day, but that's about it since we didn't have class, I slept late and was lazy in general.  Read a book I got at Hastings, dropped some bills off in the mailbox, ate at Subway...  That sort of thing.  I called Cingular to find out why I was being charged 10 $'s more than usual...  Turns out I was paying for text messanging and directory assistance, both of which I thought was included.  $1.21 for directory assistance and $7.20 for text messanging...  10 cents a message!  So I called Customer service and changed my plan a bit so I get 100 text messages for 2.99....  I don't want to even think about what my next bill will look like since that one ended 12-21 and the amount of text messages I've sent since then....  New Years Eve at the Firehouse alone will probably be astronomical!!!  Oh, well, I'll deal with that when it gets here...  Thats it for now.  Laters.

      I got to thinking yesterday morning… Actually its what woke me up in the first place…  I was thinking about living in San Marcos versus living in New Braunfels and I was thinking if Mark lived in San Marc, how funny that would be, but if the Brauns lived in New Braunfels…  Well, that would just be freaking’ hilarious…  Course that might just be just me that thinks that’s funny, but isn’t that all that matters?  :0)   In other news, this school sucks, but what’s new there?  Sure we get today off, but we only had a lousy 3 weeks for break, its 10 hours away from home, its overpriced, we have dial up, since they’re too cheap to hook us up to cable which we’ve proven is actually cheaper…  But that’s not the worst of it.  It seems as though no one has been able to answer my questions.  At least not till after the 28th of this month when the academic council meets.  So I’m stuck in limbo till then, actually it’s whenever they deem it necessary to tell me what’s going on or I go demand answers.  Which do you think is more likely?  If you picked the latter over the former than you’d be correct.  I don’t have it in me to just sit on my laurels and wait, the 29th(it’s a Thursday) I’ll be in the admin building bugging the heck out of the registrar, the vice president, the academic dean and even the president if I have to.  Because by golly, I’m graduating in May with flying colors, and I won’t let some professor’s mistake keep me from it. Also Friday I learned that I like talking about myself and all my LD/ADD stuff.  I like comparing it with others’ experiences and to inform and just to generally share what I’ve been through because of it.  It’s not the first time I’ve realized this, since I’ve participated in panel discussions about it, but it was firmly reinforced talking to a friend of mine about her kids who have ADD (2 out of 3 – imagine that!) and comparing my experiences and hers with her kids.  It was a really cool moment. But this weekend in general has been fairly uneventful, went to the animal shelter (had trouble not taking home the world’s cutest dog…  :0) ), went to see Cheaper by the Dozen with Steve Martin (very cute – really funny), slept late, watched videos, went to Russellville (Hastings, and Long John Silver with Mel), and to Walmart (of course).  I was really silly and bought Finding Nemo on VHS...  So now all my Disney movies are on VHS and I have Finding Nemo on DVD and VHS...  Go me,huh?  All in all a pretty normal weekend, bored out of my gourd.  I was going to call Peaches, but never did.  Oh, well.  Tonight its homework and catching up on stuff I recorded off of TV last week (lots of Sharon and The View),  Lucky me, huh?  Laters.

      Not much of note today....  Class till noon (in my 8 am class there are actually 19 guys and 2 girls - I counted. Only about a 4th of those would I even consider dating, most are baseball players....), Galleywinter for awhile, Walmart, Movie Gallery, and home...  Housecleaning and unpacking....  Thought about going to Hastings, never got out the door...  Made dinner, watched TV, and hungout on Galleywinter....   I'm afraid I'm a wee bit addicted now...  Oh, well, I'm not paying for internet access, the school is...  hehehe....  :0)   Only a few really interesting things that happened today is I saw an old friend in town and that got me to thinking about some stuff one of my roommates told me...  She thought he had a thing for my last year, after I had a crush on him, as always seems to be the case for me....  I asked her why she thought and she said it was 'just a feeling' so now I can't quit thinking about him, is that not insanity?  Oh, well, I'll live as always.....   Dell was supposed to call today and hasn't.... So I still have no sound on my computer...  So still no GWE radio... *sniff sniff* :0(    I have to wait until after the 28th of this month to learn whether or not I'm officially off academic probation and homefree for graduating in May, as well as getting out of the JLC and into the Student Support Services instead....  That really sucks.... I think I'll go to Hastings 2morrow after class....  Cheer myself up with a new CD or 2.....  We have Monday off and I had thought about going to Dallas but I think I'll just stay here and annoy Peaches and sleep late instead....  :0)  Laters....

      Ok, so I've been thinking....  (A dangerous proposition I know)  I've decided a few things...  1.  I would rather say that my mom lives in the River Oaks section of town than say her new place is in Midtown...  Midtown isn't that great...  Whereas River Oaks, kind of impresses people.  Then again I could say she lived in Montrose, THAT would say alot...  :0)  2.  The week of April 12th and the entire month of March must have really bad weather or something cuz I know a shitload of peeps with December and January 12th B-days...  Seriously, there are at least 12 I can think of in December just off the top of my head, and 4 on the 12th of January...  What's that tell ya?  :0)  3.  I'm addicted to the Galleywinter forum....  urlLink    I can't quite going back every couple of hours and I just discovered it like Sunday....  Thats pretty bad...  4.  I knew it would rain yesterday, as I washed my car on Monday and without fail the day after I wash my car, it ALWAYS rains the next day...   Los Lonely Boys were on Conan last night...  They were alright.  I'm not sure why I like them, I just do...  They don't look like they would sound good live but who knows, it might just be me....  Pat was supposed to be on GAC tonight, I don't know if I just missed it or what cuz I was watching Pirates of the Caribbean in the living room and taping Angel in my room at 8 and 9...  So I'll have find out about it 2nd hand....  Bleu and Stoney are playing at the Surf Club next week and Becca has already promised to take pics when she goes...  Those two are just hilarious together...  They play off each other and its just classic....  Maybe I'll get lucky and she'll call me when they play like she did last time...  Maybe I'll get even luckier still and they'll play together while I'm home in March, I know Wade's in Houston one day that week...  Shoot I'd just like to see Bleu again and again and again....  I'd like to do a few other things to him as well, but we won't get into that here....  ;0)   So I'm in class today and my 11 o'clock class is Inclusive Legal Practices and I realize how much it is like my high school government class, only geared more to the educational aspects....  In my 10 oclock class, Behavior Management, I actually did the assignment early without realizing it...  I also, unwittingly, drew it like my mom's classroom 2 years ago when she was teaching 3rd grade.  BTW the assignment was to draw our ideal classroom....  :0)  NEway I'm off to bed (early I know) but I have an 8 am class so my alarm's set for 6...  Ew...  At least there are 16 or 17 semi attractive males and only 2 females...   Reminds me of home where the ratio is 6:1... :0)  Lucky me huh?  :0)  Laters!!!!

      So I did it...  I procrastinated doing homework last night and wrote Wade on Wade just like I said I would...   It's pretty much the same words, with some structural changes and it sounds a bit dirty which in my opinion makes it funnier.  Also its only a rough copy adn I was just playing with the words....  Here it is... Mile upon Mile, he’s got no direction He’s just playing the same ol’ game He’s just looking for some kinda redemption Just afraid to say your name So caught up in pretending What he’s seeking is always true He’s just looking for a happy ending  All he’s looking for is you  And he came upon you Wade on Wade You’re the reason he’s still here Is he the one you were sent to save And he came upon you Wade on Wade  He wandered out into the water And thought that he maybe he would drown He knew exactly what he was after He knows about going down And that’s when he found you  Not afraid any more You said,” you know I always had you, baby” Just waiting for you to find what you were looking for.   Chorus  Wade on wade, wade on wade  Chorus  He made the clouds break and the angels cry You ain’t gotta walk alone  That’s why they put him in your way And then he came upon you Wade on Wade.  Chorus   Repeat Chorus  Pretty bad huh?  I let a few of my friends hear it and they laughed...  So yeah...  Just wanted to share...  :0) More laters.....

      "You'll never reach your destiny when only traveling on the shiny days...."  - Unknown  Another one from my teacher calendar....  Very true as well...  If you don't move forward how will you ever reach your goals, ya know?  Its sort of like the one where it something about you'll never reach your destination when your standing still...  I find this only helps reinforce my New Years Affirmations (not resolutions, affirmations....  Resolutions I break far to easily...  I've explained this already.....  After New years eve...).    So Thursday Pat Green plays in Little Rock and Ragweed plays in Ft. Smith on Friday...  And I just found out about them...  So surprise, surprise, they're sold out...  Oh, well, I'll live.  I might get to see Willie Nelson over Spring Break, if I can get a ticket to the rodeo...  More than likely not, but its all good...    Today was the first day of Tuesday Thursday classes and I have an 8 o'clock, but at least I'm done by noon...  In my 8 o'clock however, I am one of only 2 girls and there are about 15 guys...  I like them odds....  Though most of these guys are sophomores and juniors, some are only fair to mildly attractive so maybe not...  We'll see...  I took the world's greatest nap today...  From about 5 or so till about 7, when a friend of mine called to tell me his computer had crashed...  I HAD set my alarm but it didn't go off, so it was definitely a good thing he called...    I went to Walmart earlier to get some school supplies and the fog was nearly overwhelming...  It was scary as all get out when you can't see things you know are like right there cuz the fog was hiding it...  But I got home safely and soundly so its all good...    I have a 3 day weekend this weekend, the school is doing a bowling night on Friday and a dance on Saturday, but I'm not sure I'm going to either...   I was thinking about going to Dallas and meeting up with my mom and sister and hanging out, but who knows....  Speaking of school sponsored stuff...  A guy named John Rush was playing here (independent music guy the student activities board had brought in)  and I got there just in time to hear a really good story....  He met Pat Green in Nashville a few years ago when he (Rush, not Pat) was playing at this bar and Pat drives up in his tour bus with his band and everything and Rush thought nothing of it cuz it was in Nashville and everyone seemed to have those things...  He said Pat put 40$'s in tips in his jar and asked to play a song or 2, Nash let him and sat down to drink a beer...  After a few songs Pat asked if he could play some more and Rush told him sure, he'd never been able to get paid and drink beer...  While he was telling the story I was thinking then obviously you've never been to a Texas musicians' gig, cuz they all seem to...  But the funny thing (no that wasn't it) was that he called Pat a cross over artist, he didn't really play country it was more like country rock and I was like finally someone in Nashville recognizes good music!  Its about damn time....    Anyway that's about it for now I have about an hour of homework (and I'm going to try to make up more Lyrics to the newest hit song, "Wade on Wade"...  hehehehe....  :0) ) to do so I better scoot...  :0)  Laters.

      An honest 7 year old admitted calmly to her parents that Billy Brown had kissed her after class.  “How did it happen?” gasped her mother.  “It wasn’t easy,” admitted the young lady, “but three girls helped me catch him.”  This is one of the reasons kids just make you smile, ya know?  They remind you of when life used to be simple.... That’s part of why I want to teach.  That’s from my year long teacher calendar, its got a bunch of little stories and stuff about teaching.  I don’t know if they’re supposed to be inspiring, but they are.  At least to me.    So anyway, I got back to Arkansas Saturday night and went to bed at like 11:30 and slept till noon Sunday.  I wasn’t tired or anything… (sarcasm)  So lets see, Thursday night I spent debating whether or not to go see Mike McClure at the Firehouse…  I wound up doing laundry instead… I love Mac, but I gots to have clean clothes too!  :0)  Friday I spent running last minute errands all over the Houston area…  Ok, so it was around the Galleria and River Oaks, but that’s my idea of what the Houston is…  :0)  Friday night saw Return of the King with Mom as we were the only 2 people I know who HADN’T seen it…  So after 3 and a half hours I was thinking, good movie, kinda long, and GAWD I GOTTA PEE!!!  Exactly in that order no less…  :0)  The drive back was long and tedious once again.  I got started late since Mom wanted to talk to me about school and Spring Break…  We’re thinking about driving through the hill country and seeing if we can find any early blooming bluebonnets…   That would just be kick ass… :0)   So I get back Saturday, see Los Lonely Boys on Austin City Limits, fell asleep (out of pure exhaustion not cuz they’re boring – cuz they definitely are not!)  about half way through…  So Sunday was spent unpacking (still not done) and watching TV…  Saw that Tupac video, Dying to Live, and I got to thinking about something one of my friends said and I found myself agreeing emphatically…  He said that 2Pac was a prophetic like or psychic, man, cuz its like he saw his own death…  How insane is that?  On top of that the video is just haunting and just plain… sweet….  Also found something really funny on one of my Yahoo groups, or was it galleywinter.com (I can’t remember) where Wade Bowen was being made fun of, which is ALWAYS fun…  Blamo said,"If Wade had a clone he could stand on his clone's shoulders and you could call him Wade on Wade."  That so just cracked me up…  And according to someone else, Wade said it when he was drunk and just imaging that just made it even more hilarious….  I also read a bunch of stories about the Big Ski Trip in Steamboat....  Some funny shite went down....  ;0) So today was the first day of class…  Cheapest tuition and books ever, seriously….  A little over 8,000 for tuition, room and board and just under 200 for my books…  Pretty sweet deal…  Classes so far seem manageable, though I have an 8 oclock 2morrow morning, but I’m done by noon…  So in a way its good, but it also sucks…  Oh, well, I’ll live and I may even eventually adapt!  :0)  In other news, I finally washed my car…  First time in monthes…  I spent like an hour washing and drying and Windexing the beast…  And now she’s all pretty and ready to go…   Where I’m not sure, but we’ll figure it out when we get there!  Laters!

      So I had like 7 hours of sleep last night, more than night before last by I was awoken at 9 this morning by a ringing phone....  I didn't get to it, but it woke me up...  Turns out to be my sister's best friend/roomie wanting to see if my mom was home...  Then my mom's best friend (also my best friend's mom) called and asked if mom was home, she forgot mom started school... I can completely understand why she would with all that's been going on in her family...  Then I called Linz's roomie and promised to help her out, so I got up and showered and changed clothes.  When I called her back she said it was all taken care of...  Then my advisor from school called and we spent a good 10 minutes on the phone...  I go back to getting ready for the day and the phone rings  AGAIN  and its the car repair place saying Lindsay should bring her car in ASAP...  So I spent 2 hours trying to get ahold of her and we dropped her car off about 1 or so and went out to lunch and then to the Galleria...   They didn't have my Kate Spade refills...  The woman there was like we no longer carry Kate Spade paper products...  As if paper were revolting and the fact it was Kate Spade even worse...  So we come home so Lindsay can grab her face wash and then I drop her off at her apartment down the street...  I came home, checked my email and get on my messagers for a few minutes....  I got to talk to a friend of mine I hadn't talked to since before Christmas Break...  I gave him some really great advice (it involved Britney Spears and weddings - I called it pulling a Britney...  hehehe...)...  :0)   Then I went to Target and bought some stuff I really, really needed...  Face wash, shampoo, that sort of thing....  :0)  I came home and did a bit of cleaning before going to Krogers....  Came home, made dinner, cleaned up the kitchen and going to go watch either Finding Nemo or 7 Brides For 7 Brothers....  Wait a sec, I rented Uptown Girls!  (How could I forget???)  So yeah I'm off like a prom dress...  Though, I didn't go to my prom, so my senior formal dress didn't come off in that sort of fashion as I went with a friend who had a girlfriend and I'm not that sort of girl....  So once again I'm gone, laters!

      I've had an interesting day to say the least...   I took Lindsay to the body shop (by MHS over half an hour away from the townhouse and her apartment on I-10 no less...  We got off at Wirt and took Westview, brilliant idea there...  All 5 schools on that street had just let out so there was traffic there too....   Lucky us, huh?).  She had to get her side mirror checked as well as some other stuff...  Turns out they can't do any of that without the new mirror which doesn't come in till 2morrow...  They told us to bring it back 2morrow between 2 and 3.  I asked her (after stomping my foot childishly, of course....) if she could get anyone else could take her, turns out her current boyfriend is working as may her roommate, who just got back from London (England)....  So I may be delaying my trip to New Braunfels till Thursday.  Depends on her roomie's working situation.  So after we were done there we went to the mall and went to Abercrombie & Fitch and Skankever 21...  Oops I meant to say Forever 21...  :p  So at A & F we run into Linz's old manager Kyle, he confused me with Lauren, the best sort of confusion I think, she's really pretty, tall, blond, skinny...  Book smart, but not very smart about everyday stuff....  Though she does know a lot about MTV shows and SNL....  :0)  But yeah, Kyle, hottie.... *fanning self* Nice body, dirty blond with light blond streaks (probably fake), and did I mention nice body?   Lindsay told me he had gotten her current man's old job as district manager and that they used (her boyfriend and Kyle) used to be friends as well as roomies, when Mike (Lindsay's boyfriend) quit A & F told Kyle to quit speaking to people who 'didn't work at A & F any longer'...  That was just wrong of them, but the asswipe actually did quit speaking to Mike, how putrid is that?  But anyway, we met Mom at Starbucks in the mall and as it turns out I went to high school with one of the girls that worked there...  Been awhile since I've run inot anyone from high school...  Probably last time I went to see John Price play at some club or another, it was a virtual high school reunion....  So after that I went over to Marshall's and Loehmann's and Ross's looking for a new gray sweatshirt jacket and black aerobic pants...  Found the pants, but not the jacket...  I'll go to Old Navy and see what they have 2morrow if I don't go to NB....  Also need to get my eyes checked b4 I leave town as well as go to Needless Markup (also known as Neiman Marcus) cuz I need a new 2004 planner refill for my Kate Spade planner...  So many things to do, so little time....      Last night mom told me that my best friend's entire family is pretty bad off at the moment...  My best friend is having surgery on Friday, her father's recuperating from cancer and cancer treatments, and her older sister just had a miscarriage after trying for years to get pregnant and being pregnant for a month...  There was a heart beat at her doctor's appointment last time but she went in the other day and no heart beat to be found...  They had to do a DNC, pretty much a removal of the fetus, or an abortion...  But the fetus is already dead and it can be unhealthy for the mother to wait for it to abort naturally, as on occasion it won't...  (God I learned alot in my Early Childhood class last semester....  :0) )  Only her mom and younger sister are completely healthy (knock on wood)...  Poor girl...   Tonight I've been reading about suicide among teens and some other that just made me think...  If I died tommorrow who would remember me?  Would I have regrets about things I hadn't done or said?  The answer to the latter is yes...  Though I can't say I know many people who could answer no to that question....  Mainly I regret things I haven't said to people I care about, and I wonder would they know how much I care about them, friends, family, or just guys I'm attracted to even?  Things I haven't done...  Oh, boy, they aren't too numerous to name I just can't think of a good example of one...  I'm not contemplating death, its just the unlived life, you know?  What do you want to do that you haven't done?  Or said in a particular situation that would have sidelined a fight or posssibly begun a romance....  Makes me wanna do it all, see it all,  feel  it all......  I want to take life and squeeze every last bit of joy, love, hate, envy, sadness....  Everything there is...  Just squeeeze it till there's nothing left....  Perfect song for the moment came on, Walt Wilkins "Night Rain City" on GWE Radio...  Main line is "It was one of those moments....  You can keep for the rest of your life..."  How appropriate for my frame of mind...  :0)  NEway thats it for this evening....

      So I watched the movie version of the play Hair the other night and realized that I have never seen a movie that covered so many social issues...  Stuff like the Vietnam War, racial issues, hippies and stereotypes associated with them and a whole lot of other stuff, but by the end I was sort of depressed...  So I watched Almost Famous, cuz the stupid DVD player wouldn't let me watch Finding Nemo....  Darn electronics...  Last night Mom, Lauren and I went to Hugo's for Lauren's birthday, not till next Monday, but she goes back to Ft. Worth tommorrow so we celebrated last night.   Then we went to the Museum of Fine Arts for the last night of the Heroic American exhibit and I actually saw the original Starry Night by Van Gogh, my most farotie painting ever....  It was smaller than I had expected, kind of like the Mona Lisa at the Louvre in Paris...   Today I'm off to the Galleria to run some errands and maybe tommorrow or the next day I'll go to New Braunfels...  Who knows? :0)  Laters!

      Egads a New Year!!!   Is it 2004 already?   What happened to 2003?  It was here and then it was gone....  Well, Happy Belated New Year then everyone....  Personally  I'm still recovering from New Year's Eve.  Not the drunk hang over type recovering, as I only had half a glass of champagne, but more the fact I didn't get to bed till after 3 in the morning and my body's not used to that schedule anymore...  I'm getting old, don't ya know?  I'm in bed by 1 usually....   :0)  But anyway New Year's Eve....  Oh, my....  It was a freaking blast!   My friend Becca was supposed to come up here from Corpus but she got sick and couldn't, so I went to the Firehouse by myself.  Not a huge deal as my few friends here in town don't like going to bars like that, they prefer more of the club type places or their own living rooms....   Sillies....   NEway, NYE rocked my socks off!  Brandon Ryder, Randy Rogers and Bleu Edmondson all played there and it was soooo incredibly great!  First time I've seen Bleu play since last summer, second time I've seen Randy Rogers, and first I've seen Brandon Ryder....   Brandon did 2 hours or so of playing then Randy and band (including the ever adorable Brady Black) and just after midnight Bleu and the boys took the stage...  Coby got to do the count down, but he did it in such a Coby like fashion, very dramatic faces and pauses for effect.  Then Bleu started to play and I swore I was over him in the first 5 minutes he played, and then he smiled....  Darn that man!  He's just got the worlds most devilish smile where it looks like hes planning some form of mischief and he wants you to join him and then hes just having so much fun on stage on top of that, how can you not love that?  :0)  He did one of my faves, Soul Shine and as an encore he did one of my other faves, A Good Thing....   Too bad he didn't do either of my others, 2 Penny Vengeance or Live Oak Lullaby, but maybe next time....  I haven't hear him do Soul Shine since the summer of 2002, or so I think....   Anyway Randy and Brandon got up on stage with him for a song or two and Randy kept coming back and just laying his head on either Bleu or John Mike's or Coby's shoulders....  At one point he even kissed Bleu on the cheek it was soooo cute...  Bleu kept yelling at the audience sing along if you know the words and came back for like 4 encore songs....   He was like I can stay here as long as yall want me....  That was just sweet!  At one point during the very last encore song he got down in the audience (what was left of us at 2 am) and was standing next to me just watching his band, that was pretty cool too...  :0)   There were some really rude people there too who kept pushing and shoving and jumping around, I got elbowed in the boobs more times than I can count, but I wound up talking to some really sweet lady up front and another girl and her boyfriend, so it was all good.... Oh, I forgot to mention, Randy during his set was talking to a couple of people up on the balcony and it turns out there was a couple who had been married 43 years...   43 years, man, thats a long time....   Neway everyone applauded them and then he launched into Blow up doll and someone brought out a blow up doll that got tossed around....  All in all a good time....  So I got home about 3ish....  and barely managed to wash my face and change clothes b4 falling into bed...   Ok, so someone asked what my resolutions were for this year...  I had 3, but I'm down to one.... 1.  Don't curse (broke it about 12:15 when Bleu said something about are yall having a good fucking time....  I yelled back Fuck yea!), now been amended to don't curse so much..... 2.  Eat Healtier (not going to jeapordize myself and say lose weight, just eat healthier) 3. Can't remember #3, but I'm sure I broke it too......  :0) So yeah thats about it for now....  Laters!!!!

      Ok, so its been almost a week since I last posted but I've had darn good reason!!!   1.  The dog 2.  I need to sleep 3.  I've been busy with Galleywinter 4.  I've been in class  But for the last 2 days and for who knows how long my internet connection is fubar....  I don't knwo whats going on with it but if it keeps up for the next day or so I'm calling computer services...  Then who knows how long it'll take to get it fixed???    So yeah if anyone needs to get ahold of me for whatever reason, email me at sunnychic78@yahoo.com.  I'd say call me but my cell is fubar too....  Stupid technology...  So much for thinking this week would be better than last week...  Laters.

      So yeah I can't take the new Allman Brothers CD out of the player...  Techinically its not new I know, but I just got it Sunday, so I'm all bout it at the moment...  I can't seem to get past #3 a lot of the time...  Soul Shine...  I love the Government Mule version and I adore the way Bleu does it too, but there's just something about the original that just sounds...  right.  Of course, 6 or 7 years ago, I don't think I would have ever in a million years felt this way...  Ahh, the Chaz years....  I should have known then that pretty boys were trouble and saved myself alot of heartache later on...  Course immediately after the Chaz period of my life I couldn't listen to Margeritaville without tearing up...  Let alone any Buffett or classic rock...   Took me a while to understand as much as I liked him, and as much as the music has lots of memories, I love the music.  Hard to believe its that simple...  But in this case it is.  No matter what else happens I love the music....  Back to taking the CD out of the player...  I did finally put in Boland today, found my copy of Pearl Snaps and listened to it on the way home from McDonald's...  In other news, I'm still sick...  No clue whats wrong, I know its not acid reflux, but I went to class and then came home and took a nice long nap....  Amazingly enough I also talked to my whole immediate family today...  I talked to Lauren on IM, called Linz and caught her on the way to Cabo, I thought she meant Mexico but I forgot about the bar/restaurant....  Then I called Mom and talked to her for a few minutes...  My cell phone sux so I'm going to Cingular tommorrow to yell at them since I've had it like 2 monthes and its already acting up...  Um, thats about all for now...  Laters!!!

      "S-W-I-N-G Hold my picture til I ring Hard to handle, easy to hold that’s right I’m all woman, all woman, all woman I’m easy to hold." - Terri Hendrix  That's been stuck in my head the last 2 days....  Not a bad song to get stuck...  Better then the Hairbrush song from VeggieTales (did anyone else NOT know its a Christian children's program???).   So yesterday I slept late and missed class.  So I missed walking to class with Zach....  Hung out at the house, went to Walmart, Galleywintered, went to the shelter, ate dinner, and attempted to help Mel study...  That didn't work out real well....  I don't really study well with others and my methods are completely different from hers... Class this morning and then that test at 11... It was soo short...  I ran into Mark and he had Sadie with him...  She's grown SOOO much, but then puppies usually do...  I spent a little while tossing the ball for her before going to my noon class....  After class JC and I decided to work on our flannel board presentations...  We finally settled on Friday after calss since we're both busy until then...  I ran into Little and he gave me a little may backrub b4 he had to run to class....  Another reason I love baseball boys....  Strong hands....  Then I ran into Josh in the ed lab and got another little back massage....  Gawd I'm such a back rub whore....  But since Chuck and James graduated and I was at home, I haven't had many in the last month or so...  It was soooooo nice...  After that came home for lunch and went to the shelter again, this time with the Amandas and somehow we wound up bringing home a dog...  We'd talked about it, but this dog was perfect (by their definition)  and he was about to be put to sleep tommorrow.... So we paid the 15 $ to spring him from the joint...  We brought him home and then went to Walmart and got about 40$ worth of stuff...  He hasn't stopped pawing and scratching and whining at the backdoor for more than 5 or 10 minutes at a stretch...  We've walked him numerous times and he's done his business, but he still scratches and whines...  I don't know what to do about it and I think both the Amandas are at a loss as well...  I wouldn't have agreed to get him if he hadn't have been so cheap and about to be put to sleep...   There were other dogs that were going to be as well, how did we end up with this one?  I have nada clue...  I would have rather have had one of the middle sized females(one or two of them acted as though they'd been abused) adn the most adorable timid hound mix (including India when I was volunteering at CAPs) boy I'd ever met...  He acted like he had been abused as well...  Raising your voice or moving to quickly scared the bejesus outta him...  Aw, man, now I wanna go back...  :(  Anyway I don't feel good and I'm tired...  And I still have homework to do...  This just sucks....  Not even talking about  my current crush seems to be making me feel better (I'm onthe phone as I type this....) Anyway lets see what I can get done b4 the Bachorlette comes on...  Laters....

      "Did you ever see Dallas from a DC-9 at night? Well Dallas is a jewel, oh yeah, Dallas is a beautiful sight. And Dallas is a jungle but Dallas gives a beautiful light." - Jack Ingram  So, yeah I've got Dallas on the mind for some reason...  Could have something to do with my recent musings on people from Dallas...  I figured out that the majority of my exes have been associated with it in some form or fashion, whether it be that they were born there, lived there as a child or currently live there....  I think there's something in the water there that makes the guys hot and irresistable to me?  Most recently there's Zack...  Too pretty for a guy, but he's a sweetie to boot...  Good thing he's not dating Julie anymore or I might feel bad...  Speaking of Dallas, Jessica Simpson...  Is it just me or is she a blow up doll like Randy sings about?  No, wait her name's Wendy!!  Gawd, that was mean....  Oh, well...  Even I'm entitled to be a bitch every now and then.   One reason I'm a bit of a wench might be the lack of sleep...  I had like 3 or 4 hours last night... I quit talking to Kev and Sarah last night at like 3 or so and I got ready for bed and settled into bed...  Bam, the phone rings....  Its Nathan, in tears about his latest fiasco with his boyfriend..  Same song different tune...  Made me realize how much I miss my boys...  I called B this afternoon near tears....  Not just cause of that, but I got an email from a friend of mine that got married like 2 years ago, turns out his wife is pregnant and due in September...  Then I start listening to Nobody left to run with anymore by the Allman Brothers in the car and I got to thinking how true that is for me...  Most of my friends have significant others and a couple have kids/or are having kids... So yeah I was in a bit of a funk....  I was happy for Chuck and Cara, but at the same time I was thinking, but they're younger than me!!!   Anyway so that prompted me to get B to promise me we'd do something all together at some point this summer since we haven't all been together since....  Sometime around the New Year's of 2002-2003...  Sure I've hung out with Nate, and Sean and again with B, but we haven't all (including Tom) been together since then...  With Nate and Sean in Santa Cruz, and Tom in Baja and me in Arkansas for school, it hasn't been easy...  At least now B's in H-Town so we can hang out more than we used to...  But my point before with the friends with significant others...  I always feel like a 3rd wheel and I just want everyone to know come hell or high water you're all welcome at my place...  Where ever that may happen to be...  More than likely New Braunfels...  Hill country for sure....  :0)  Thats about it for now... Laters!

      "And if you asked me I would smile.  And we could sit and talk awhile.  But there’s just too much to hide.  And I got nothin’ left inside.  I'm just a little bit crazy..."-BEB  Ok, so there's one of my theme songs...  The other?  "Trouble'' by Pink...  There's a few others for various moods but those are the main ones....  :0) I saw a really funny/scary commercial today...  With the Muppets and Jessica Simpson for Pizza Hut...  The basis for the whole commercial was Jessica and Kermit falling in love over pizza with a very jealous Miss Piggy jumping in... Oh, yeah, a shout out right quick...  To miss Amanda Jo, for helping me fix my links!!!  :0) Lets see, my cell phone's been acting up and I went to Cingular last night but they had already closed...  AT 3 PM IN THE AFTERNOON!!!!  Freaking insane....  A stupid pinprick local yokel redneck good ol' boy cop followed me almost all the way home...  Just hoping I'd do something stupid, I bet!  Yeah, right....  Not in AR I don't.....  Or in Okieland...  No stoopid chit allowed there, at least driving wise...  Anyway, so I was going to go to Rville to the movies, but I woound up staying in town cause it was snowing like an hour away and I didn't know if it would in Rville or not...  It didn't.  Besides I didn't want to risk not having a functioning cell phone in case of emergencies....  That would suck worse than being single on VD....  V-Day was pretty unproductive...  Talked to some of my Galleypeeps til early this morning...  Woke up at noon hungry... Made pancakes, showered...  I was listening to the Phantom of the Opera soundtrack and I got to thinking, if it wasn't so freaky and the Phantom wasn't a nutcase, it could be a very romantic play...  It was gorgeous today, I went to Walmart....  Then I went to Rville and to Hastings.  Got a couple of CDs cheap...  I asked if they had the new Doug Moreland and according to the cutie pie I was talking to, it doesn't come out till March 2nd..  I tried to 'splain to him it was already out...  Don't think I got my point across.  Some weird old guy was like following me around, so I made some phone calls to appear unapproachable.  Mom's doing well after her surgery Friday.  She doesn't have school tommmorrow since its Presidents day...  Lucky her...  Let's see what else?  Currently I'm working on an article review for tommorrow for intergrated methods and thinking about going to bed...  In fact I just might and get up early and work on this stuff some more....  In fact I think I just might...  G'Night, and I'll talk to yall laters!

      Ok, so it dawned on me after I blogged the other day, I might have come off as a jealous shrew, when in fact, I could care less...  I think Bleu's one of those unattainable kinda of guys.  So yeah, the only times I get to be a shrew at a BEB concert is when the drunks start shoving me around...  Then its on till the break o dawn...  :0) But anyways, since I last blogged, I've done laundry (took me almost 3 hours to get it done), been to class, Galleywintered my ass off, eaten, slept...  Oh, yeah I was up till like 5 Friday morning talking to Kara and Kevin (everyone else went to bed by like 2)...  It was greatness...  Yesterday I went to class on 4 hours of sleep...  Good thing we didn't have to do a lot of thinking...  I ran into Mark at the elevator and we got to talking, turns out he went to the bar for quarter beer night and was completely hungover....  I had a good laugh at his expense....  I told him we should get drunk together sometime, and I had completely forgotten one thing...  He's got a little freshman girlfriend...  Oh, well, there are other fish in the sea....  Anywho, Amanda brought Corinne to class, since she was 'sick'...  Theres some stuff going on there, that might prevent SissyK from going on to 8th grade....  Though it sounds to me it might be the teachers fault in this case more than the students...  And not just cause I adore Amanda's kids in general, but the way Amanda told it, this teacher is just a big goober...  My stuff from Vicky's Secret got here....  Yah!!!  :0)  I also brought Manda's flowers home for her, since Jessi couldn't get ahold of her....So I Galleywintered some more, watched Lion King 1 and a half, very cute movie...  Talked to some of my Galley peeps and then crashed about 12:30 or so and woke up like an hour ago, with the song Masquerade from Phantom of the Opera stuck in my head...  Weirdness...  By the way for those that are wondering, not only am I a garage gurl, I'm also the perfect girlfriend (how am I still single?), my inner child is 10 years old, I would be a Cosmopolitan if I were a drink and am an Aesthete ....  For those that have done the Quizilla quizzes you know what I'm talking about....  :0)  Oh, and I also got a 328 (You are definitely a kinky player) on the kinky quiz, I took it before and only got a 243 I wonder what happened?  :0) Oh, yeah, by the way, Happy Freaking Single's Awareness Day!  :P  I think I'll just treat myself to a movie unless I get talked into anything else...  I won't know for sure till I'm doing it...  Laters!

      So I was thinking in class this morning about Bleu Edmondson, and how people that are fans of his are the "Southland Mob'' and I got to thinking...  Its not so much the Southland Mob as "Bleu Edmondson's Harem"...  No, no, seriously...  Check this out, every time I go to see him play, there are scads of scantily clad girls all over the place...  Most come with their boyfriends, but there's a select group of girls that mob the stage (yes I'm usually one of them, but thats not my point) and they'll just stand there and jostle for the best places to stare and drool and flirt...  Its freaking ridiculous!  Sure there are a few guys that are there to get drunk and hear the music and then there's Coby's fan club....  :0)  Not even going into that... Also though I'm curious how BEB's Southland Mob, aka Mobsters, don't get confused with Morrow's Mobsters...  Not everyone likes Cory, but they're into BEB or vice versa so yeah....  Just randomness there....  :0) I'm off to return a movie, and get an oil change....  Laters.

      I LOVE MY MOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Okay, now that we've cleared that up....  :0)  No, really, she is the best.  I was bitching about not having my low fat brownies and having to go like 8 places and still not finding them....   Then surprises me with 2 boxes of mix...  Gotta love that...  I think I like it even more than if she had made it and sent it, cuz now I can eat more dough!!!  :0)  hehehe...   I dyed my hair last night...  I'm a redhead again....  For the last time till October....  The whole blond thing is a blessing and a curse....  March I start streaking naturally, and no matter what I do I go blond all summer....  Oh, well.  I'll live.  I always do!  :0) Did I mention I LOVE MY MOM!?!?!?!? Other than that I have to decide what errands I can take care of this afternoon...  Its either, do laundry, or get the oil changed (as well as get gas I'm down on like E)....  Whichever I don't do today I'm doing tommorrow or Thursday....   I'm running low on clothes, (as in I'm out of socks)  but I'm also almost 1000 miles over and a week late....  We'll see.... Did I mention I LOVE MY MOM!?!?!?!?   Thats about it for now.... I LOVE MY MOM!!!!!!!!! Laters gaters!

      Okay so since I blogged earlier, I've thought alot about the choices guys make....  Why is it that they choose the bitchest, most snobby, snotty, illmannered sluts they can find over perfectly nice, pretty girls like me?  Oh, wait I just answered my own question...  Sluts.  Hehehe...   I mean I know its not all guys, but it seems to be the majority of the ones I meet.  I'm perfectly nice and cute to boot....  And yet the majority of the guys I like go for the aforementioned bitches...  It has a tendency to make a girl a little pissed....  This girl in particular....  I usually don't mind being the 'little sister', its actaully fun most of the time.  But when I want a date....  Let alone a relationship....  Yeah, therein lays the gray area......  Anyway with V-Day fast approaching, my whole status as a single chick is sorta shoved to the forefront with a cattle prod....  Ouch...  Anyway thats all for now.....  Laters!

      So I just got off the phone with a friend of mine, after half an hour listening to him bitch and complain about the female species....  I usually don't mind listening to my friends rant and rave, cause I've done it to them a time or two....  But with him its the same rant...  Ever since his divorce became final last year, hell before that even...  He's complained about women...  When he was single, he wondered why he couldn't get a date, when he had a girlfriend he wondered if she'd leave him for another man, or woman even.  When he was married that insecurity multiplied....  It had hand in causing the divorce, I think.  It caused the woman he married to cheat...  She found another man that wasn't so insecure and could trust her fully...  Which I can understand.  But my friend won't believe it had anything to do with his issues with trust.  When in fact, it had everything to do with it...  But yeah, so he's an extremely embittered, insecure man on the way to being a recluse and I'm feeling that as his friend, I'm helpless to prevent that from happening.  I think he might just have to deal with it himself, because as much as I adore him, he's never listened to my warnings about his attitude and he's not about to start now...  So as much as I hate to do, I might just have to let him deal with this on his own since I have so much other stuff on my plate at the moment, I don't think I'm equipped to deal with his stuff...  I'm tempted to call him back and tell him to see a professional...  I might just do it, cuz its the last semester of MY senior year and I refuse to get caught in any sort of drama...  So yeah, I'll be here for him, but I won't let him berate me for being a female just because he's got problems with himself...  Yeah, its not like he's going to read this so I suppose I'll HAVE to call him back and tell him this...  Dude, I'm nobody's scapegoat....  :0)  Thats all for now...  Laters!

      So I've learned some new stuff in the last couple of days... First and foremost, I'm off academic probation!!!!!!  I found out for sure yesterday after getting a bunchof hmm and hawing from the school for the last week or so....  So go me!!  :0) I also learned that because I have (had) an alcoholic parent I'm more likely to have an addictive personality.  That explains SOOOOO much about me and certain habits of mine.  I get into stuff (music, guys, whatever) and I won't talk or listen to anything else for days or weeks.  Then I drop it for the next thing when I get tired of it.  And the cycle repeats itself....  Wow, huh? Umm, lets see what else...  Oh!  I talked to my Mom on Monday and said my car payment was due so I don't question cuz she's my Mom and she seems to be right about 98 % of the time.  I mail it like she said to, even though I had mailed a payment like 2 weeks ago...  I didn't question her.  Talked to her again the next day to tell I'd mailed it and she was like "No, I told you it was your car INSURANCE NOT the car PAYMENT..."  So we argued for a few minutes and she finally conceded I might be right...  Wow, take a picture someone, its a Kodak moment!!!!  :0)  I talked to her again yesterday and she told me she was sending me something in the mail, so I'm thinking its something for V-Day and it might be my brownie mix...  At least I'm hoping its my brownie mix, the ones I made were too chocolatey (never thought I'd say that!!!!) and I bitched about it to her.  Usually when I bitch I get what I want...   Egads, I'm spoiled...  Naw, I'm not.   I rarely ever bitch about anything or want anything thats too unrealistic....  I'm just a sweet, innocent, nice girl...  ;0)  And if you believe that I've got a bridge in Arizona I can sell ya, crosses right over a canyon, great view, going for cheap!  Hehehe....  I crack myself up!  :0) Here's poem before I go.... My life is sad but beautiful Loving, but filled with hatred. I'm looked upon as the underdog, But I know I'm somebody And more than that I'm myself My mind is free But my body is shackled. The door of hope is locked, The key to life is in my mind.  -S.H. Hard to believe that came out of one of my education books, isn't it?  Okay thats it for now...  Laters!!!

      So its raining...  It hasn't stopped raining since about 3 or so this afternoon and its been sleeting on and off to boot.  Its cold, its wet, and now its dark...  And I hate all of the above....  So yeah it sucks monkey balls.  People further north have already canceled stuff 4 tomorrow...  We of course never cancel classes unless there is 6 inches of snow on the ground AND ice on the roads.  So yeah, I still have that test at 8 am...  God I have 8 oclock classes....  I woke up an hour earlier than usual by accident and yet I was still late for class...  Oh, well.  I was going to go to Fayetteville and see Pat Green, but I have this test tommorrow and then this rain/sleet/snow stuff started...  Just found out the Bachelorette will be on later tonight because of some sort of contractual obligation to basketball....  Earlier I thought I was going insane trying to find it...  I was like American Idol's over, where's the Bachelorette!?!?!!?!?  Nice to know the mind's not completely gone....  :0)   I spent about an hour or so gathering info for Matt Powell's manager, so that maybe he could play in Arkansas (hopefully while I'm still here).  That'd be sweet....  :0)  Let's see.....  Mom and I argued tonight about something she said on Monday, she finally agreed I 'may' have been right...  Always nice to know I can win an argument with her.  :0)  Checked my voice mail on my cell and I had like 12 messages starting from like the 6th of January.....   I even had one from my aunt and grandmother thinking they had called my sister Lauren's cell and leaving me a voice mail like I was her, even though my message says MY name....  I called Lauren to let her know that and wound up leaving her a voice mail....  Oh, I found out I made an A on my Inclusive Legal test from last week....  Also got the finals schedule and found out for sure I can go to Ft. Worth on the afternoon of the  May 7th....  That was my only concern about getting to Lauren's graduation on the 8th by 10 am...   I didn't really want to have to drive it at night or early in the morning, so its all good.... Thats about it for now.  Laters!

      “I did it all for the brownie mix, yeah, the brownie mix…”  Somehow that doesn’t have the same ring to it as “Nookie” but it applies to me.  I went to all 3 stores in Clarksvegas and the 5 in Russellville looking for my Sweet Rewards Low Fat Brownies…. And not one place had them!  Walmart I know had them at  one point since I’ve bought them there b4, but I just had this horrible brownie craving and nothing else would do.  Finally wound up settling on the regular kind with the full fat.   But while I was driving to Russellville and back I realized something….  Well, I knew it b4, but it got reinforced on Friday.  It seems like no one up here knows how to drive….  They get in the fast lane and go slow, leave the turn signals on with no intention of turning, turn with little to no warning, pull out in front of you with inches to spare and pretend like its an everyday thing….  Flicking them off, honking and general gestures of extreme emotion don’t seem to phase them, they just wave and smile like they’re in a freaking parade or something!!!!  Ok, rant officially over….. Chuck came to visit this weekend from Norman.  He wound up staying at the Monkey’s house and we all hung out for a while Saturday night.  I played Monopoly for the first time in months and Star Wars Monopoly for the first time ever.  It was definitely interesting.  Friday night I hung out with Mel and went to the Coffehouse.  Then yesterday I was sick, so I chilled at the casa, nothing too impressive occurred…  Pretty much was on Galleywinter whenever I wasn’t reading, eating, or watching TV…..   That’s about it for now.  Laterski!

      So today hasn't been that great...  In fact its been rather nonglorious....  It all started with getting up late and ends a few minutes when I go to bed... Ok, thats a fib only this afternoon sucked greasy brown monkey balls....  Classes were all right, did well on my Inclusive legal test I think, and turned in my book for Intergrated Methods, everyone I showed seemed to like it...   Came back to the house and ate lunch, read for a while, and checked my email, that's where my trouble started.....  I got an email from a friend of a friend saying that my ex, we'll call him Brandon, had a new girlfriend that was sweet and cute and her name was Amelia (name changed to protect my own ass...).  We broke up at the end of last year and we've remained good friends...  Fact of the matter is I was sorta hoping for a another shot...  I figured it was a long shot, but to hear I could have been knocked over with a feather...  I did a bad bad thing and called him up in a tizzy...  My feelings were hurt and I acted impulsively (see - without thinking).  That helped me a bit...   I asked why he didn't tell me and he couldn't come up with a good answer.  Then I asked how long they'd been together and he hemmed and hawed a bit but never really gave me an answer...  Which is making me suspicious...  But I got over the shock and hit anger and so I went to Walmart and conducted a bit of retail therapy...  Nothing like I could have indulged in at home, but it helped me a bit...  But I got Brother Bear and watched that (after American Idol of course - I can't believe they got rid of Amy - I loved her!!!).  Now League of their own is on and I'm thinking about going to bed....  Gawd I can't wait for tommorrow, I'm going to the primary for a couple of hours and that always makes me feel better.....  Laters!

      Wow,I've been really bad about blogging lately....  But I think midterms, and Spring Break are pretty good reasons...  Last week I sorta just chilled, didn't really have much to say....  Thought about blogging Friday but ran out of time before Heather got here....  So since the last time I blogged.....  Let's see...  Tuesday night had a dream about Bleu and salad dressing that was in no way erotic....  Last night I had the same dream about marrying Austin (though why I would want to I have no clue....).  I ordered a new PG sticker and baseball cap, and I'm getting new speakers for my computer sometime this week (sound at long last!).....  Friday I was feeling really overwhelmed...  Had some school drama and was so stressed I actually cried....  How rare is that!?!?!?!    Holy, shit, Micheal Buble looks like one of my exes sans facial hair a wee bit skinnier...  No wonder I like him so much... Even though he does look like a vampire...  Sorry he's on Wayne Brady at the moment couldn't help those observations....  Anyway, I found out Aisha's 5 monthes pregnant...  She seriously doesn't look like it...  I made chicken and dumplings last week and had leftovers till yesterday...  I never thought about it till KEVIN said something, but they really are just glorified soggy biscuits...  Good thing I like biscuits!  :0)  Heather was in town this weekend, we went to James' Friday night and then she left Saturday and I went to see Dirty Dancing 2 Saturday night...  Sunday I spent most of the day doing homework...  I felt really good when i went to bed, I was just sooo productive and I'm soooo not used to that on weekends....  :0)  Talked to Linz Saturday and she was on the way to a party at Lake Travis with Meghan...  Mom was in Austin too, but for a conference....  Let's see what else...  Oh, yeah, I wore my BEB shirt (the one he signed for me) and I can't tell you how many times people asked me who is Bleu?  Who signed that shirt?  So I got to explain to the locals about the wonders that are the Bleu Edmondson Band....  :0)  Yeah, so thats about it for now...  I have to go find something to do...  Its glorious outside and I feel totally non glorious for being inside....  Laters!!!!!!!!

      So its Monday, once again and I'm back in Arkansas and back in classes...  Lucky me, huh?  I came back yesterday instead of Saturday so I got to spend Saturday tooling around H-town...  Saturday night I spent helping Mom with a bunch of stuff for a conference this week in Austin...  Friday night Linz and stayed up till like 5 in the morning Saturday...  I had actually planned to leave Saturday but that didn't happen when Linz appeared at 11 pm, saying lets do something....  We hung out and talked and stuff till  like 2 in the morning....  Then I wound up on AOL for a couple of hours...  Speaking of which, Kevin was complaining he never gets a shout out in my blogs...  So, guess what, Kevin?  I got 2 words for you, guess what they are? :0)  hehehe...  I crack me up....  :0)  Anyway I spent most of today in class...  Came home ran some errands, went to Russellville to Hastings and now I'm home, thinking about going to Wallyworld for some stuff I need....  Anywho thats bout it for now....  Laters!

      So, its Friday, Houston, here's what youwon't find in todays Chronicle....  Or least not that I know of since I haven't looked at it lately....  So since the last time I blogged, I finished midterms Thursday....  Then Saturday I started home....   Then I had 2 blowouts and some other stuff outside Texarkana Saturday, so I got towed into town (Texarkana), and found the service dept. of Toyota closed and as it turns out they had to order parts on Monday and it was all fixed Tuesday....   Or so I thought...  But I get ahead of myself...  So I was stuck in a Courtyard Marriot in Texarkana Saturday to Tuesday...  I finally get back into Houston Tuesday night and Wednesday I run errands around town so Mom and I can go to Gruene Thursday...  More car drama, it has to be put in the shop and fixed again....  Insurance got involved and long story short I just got it back on the way back from New Braunfels tonight....  But in better news I did just get back from New Braunfels....  :)  Ok, so it was like 2 hours ago, but thats beside the point....   We went to Gruene yesterday and hung out in town and went to Gruene Hall last night to see some blues guy play...   Then we stayed at a place called the Gruene Apple B and B (tackiness incarnate and they charge out the wazoo to boot!)....   I got a new Gruene Hall shirt and Doug Moreland's new CD AND a Stragglers shirt (Property of the Stragglers - though I don't know if I would really want to actually belong to any of them, the whole band guy thing.....)....  Then today we went to San Marcos and did the outlet stores and I got a couple of pairs of 9 west sandals....  Good times....  Then we went to Wimberly and Canyon Lake to just sorta see the Hill Country...   Mom tried to convince me to live in Wimberly instead of NB, but she went about it all wrong, she emphasized stuff I don't like and dissed NB...  Bad way to go about it, she should know better than that by now...  I also found out b4 we left yesterday that Bleu was playing in Galveston, I told mom and she was like we could do that instead, but as much as I adore the man (even with the band guy thing and the fact he looks like a turtle without his hat) I needed a dose of hill country...  And I got it thank god....  Though most of the time we were worried about the damn car....   So it was good times, but not exactly relaxing times...  Now I can't decide whether to go back to school 2morrow or Sunday...  I'm so tired of being in a car and traveling and I know I won't get any homework done on Sunday (which is one of my main reasons for going back early...) so I just don't know.....  I'm all gassed up and I have cash, just have to pack so we'll see....   Thats about it for now...  Laters!

      Is no one home today?!?!?!   Thats the 5th call I've made and gotten a voice mail/answering machine!  All I wanna know is if my middle sister wants a copy of Soul Gravy....  Did I mention that I got that yesterday?  ;)  Whoo hooo!!!  Yesterday was a good day, regardless of the fact I had to go to Cingular twice (did ggt my phone fixed though), missed my 8 oclock class and got lectured by my 930 prof...   Then there was the almost embarrassing dress slipping down...  In a room full of kindergarteners at that!!!   So yeah, anyway since I last blogged, we got a cat, kitten actually....  Went to class (except that pesky 8 oclock one yesterday), went to see Hildalgo Friday night (pretty good), stayed in with the roomies Saturday night and watched a bunch of movies....  Actually I've hardly been on Galleywinter at all in the last week, come to think of it....  Weirdness....  Saw Brent on the way to Walmart Friday....  There was a suprise....  He tried to act all friendly and shit and wave and smile, but I wasn't having any of that!  I played like I was messing with my radio and since I was wearing a baseball cap, it worked pretty well...  Speaking of exdruggies finding religion, I got lectured by Joe of all people last night, but then so did both Amandas so I don't feel too bad...  Actaully I didn't in the first place it was all I could do not to laugh when I was on the phone with him....  It was some funny shit....  He didn't even get my Angel joke...  Irony, Joseph, irony....  But it is good he's quit all the drugs and shit...  Ya gotta be impressed when a 19 year old knows more than I do about drugs....   Kinda scary actaully...   But anyway, its midterms this week and life is hectic and stressful...  Had 2 tests in the last week, plus a take home due today and another tommorrow morning, PLUS a puppet show on Friday...  Plus all the work that's been due, that is now late...  But whats new there?  :)  I also have to pack half my crap while I'm at it...  Its priobably a good thing I don't plan to leave till Saturday!  Thats about all for now, I have to go study for this test....  Laters!

      "My dog is worried about the economy because dog food is up to 99 cents a can. That's almost $7.00 in dog money." - Joe Weinstein  So lets see in the week or so since I last wrote...  We've gotten Buck (the dog) a new home (12 acres, lots of otehr animals, and 4 kids to boot!), had a virus that turned out to be a worm on my computer...  That was a fun couple of days!  So I spent TX independence Day getting my computer taken care of...  Lucky me huh?  Speaking of which here's a little something I found about that....  Sittin' here the 2nd of March,  Sippin' a beer got my shirt all starched.  Friends stop by to sing and play,  Celebrate Independence Day   You can call him Bubba,  don't call him Tex.  'Cause today's the day  we pause and reflect...   'Bout them good 'ol boys,  who took to the wall,  Raised that Lone Star flag so tall.  Santa Ana killed 'em, the very last man  but that bastard's dead and Texas still stands...   -- "Independence Day" by Chris Wall  Good song and very appropriate I think....   I've been having a bunch of wierd dreams, most of them involving what I like to fondly refer to as 'band guys', also known by most people as Texas/Reddirt musicians...  And one about Tom Brady...  That was kinda odd...    Average Joe and Bacholorette ended badly....  Won't go into detail but now I have a huge crush on Matthew from The Bacholorette...  Even though I know what trouble Matts can be.....   Speaking of Matt's I ran into Moreland th other day....  We might go to see Hildalgo this weekend....   I hope he doesn't get the wrong idea like he usually does....  I hate fending off gropey hands.....  I wonder if he asnd Doug know that their families have their own personal town of Moreland in AR?  Probably not....   Also I found out I'll be home the last week of Rodeo...  I might even get to see REK and Dierks and Pat...  That would be the shiznit!  That and the Hill Country road trip should make it one hell of a Spring Break!!!  Too bad I also have 2 Dr.'s appointments that week too...  One at 8 am Monday (how am I going to get up and get accross town for that one I haven't figured out yet....) and then a teeth cleaning/lecture session at 1 Tuesday...  Lucky lucky me...  But at least I'll be home!!!  I have to do a shit load of homeowork today and go to R-ville to return some movies at Hastings and go to Cingular, since my cell phone still isn't fixed..  Some heads are gonna roll soon if they don't get on the ball....   And I'm just PMSy enough to be the one doing it.....   :0)  Laters!

      So its been one hell of a weekend....  Heather and Melly were both in town Friday night and we wound up hanging at the coffee house and watching Cheaper By the Dozen...  Heather left Saturday and Melly and I went to Russellville....  Damn, that was one memorable trip...  On the way there we get flicked off by some random (rude) old guy...  And we keep passing each other and the chick in the back seat keeps looking back at us like we were going to go off and road rage on their asses...  I was laughing so hard I almost cried...  When we got to R-Ville we went to the Toyota place and I got the # for the service dept. to call in the morning and then we went to Staples...  I was convinced I could find a Power Point program for less than 50 $'s...  Was I wrong!!!  Cheapest I found it was 110 at Hastings later that day....  So after Staples we go to Walmart and Hastings....  By this time its din din time so we grab Whattaburger (not to be confused with Whataburger)...  Where we run into Box, whom I haven't seen since he broke up with Sofia like sophmore year...  Wow...  He hasn't changed a bit...  We didn't have time for more than a hi and how are you and bye, but its interesting to run into people after so long...  So yeah, we brought dinner back to the house and watched Secondhand Lions....  Mel came over and we went to the coffeehouse to see Some Guy Named Robb (yes that was the name of the band....) play...  We stayed there till almost 11....  One point in time Lala called me (drunk) and Robb was like let me talk to her and I'm like no I don't think so so I went outside to finish our conversation...  All night long whenever he asked for requests I would name a song or an artist and he kept threatening to kill me, throw drum sticks at me, etc...  A normal concert experience all and all...  :0)  He kept replying name someone who isn't good, so I finally got him with New Kids on the Block...  He actaully kinda hummed/sang the first line...  Funny chit...  Also funny, the fact he reminded of Bleu a bit...  Looks wise and the way he played mainly...  ( can safely say Bleu would probably look good with long hair... :0) )  So yeah that had me crushing on him a little....  But everyone knows what bad news band guys are so yeah, no....  Came home and watched TV and went to bed...  Woke up, ate, watched TV, Melly left, did homeowork, and checked my email...  I found out Katie got hurt in a car crash from Kevin....  (Thanks again for the heads up, Kev!)  The way he put it she was in some dire straits for a while, but she should pull through...  I felt a whole lot better after I got on GW and read the updates...  Kev didn't (until now of course) know about my sensitivity to car crashes...  Its not nearly as bad as Heather is, but I do tend to worry more than I normally would when I hear the words 'car crash'...  If yall could send up a prayer or 2 on her behalf, as well as for her family and JD, I'd appreciate it sooooooo much....  Thanks, yall! Also Amanda got an apartment (we won't go into that sensitive subject tonight....) and they charge like 150 $'s extra for pets, so she got rid of the cat...  Gave him to friends of hers here in town...  (won't go into how I feel about that either....) Other than that, I'm just playing catch up on homework and stuff...  Last week of classes and then finals...  Oh, I talked to mom, Lala and Linz tonight...  We're all set for La's graduation in Ft Worth on the 8th....  Whoo hoo!!!  Anyway thats it for now...  Laters!

      So there are tornadoes north of town...  Lovely, lovely...  Its just sooooo been my week this week...  That was my version of sarcasm for those that don't know....  The car broke down yesterday...  The guy that looked at it thinks its the back end (again...) and the earliest I could get it back (if every thing works out) is Tuesday...    For those that want to know....  I dropped off my graduation announcements and as I was on the way back to the house and coming around the turn from the coffee house, hit the curb a bit and the car started slowing down...  I tried to floor it with very meek results...  I thought it was the tires so I pulled over and got out to check them all...  They were fine so I got in to try to back out and every time I switched gears it made a whiny sound and the stupid bitch wouldn't move at all!!!  I called Amanda, we kidnapped Andrew and he looked and dianosed it as either the transmission or the back end and since he used to work on cars, I'm inclined to believe him...  So then I called Triple A and got my car towed to a garage here in town...  They're supposed to call me today or tommorrow to let me know whats up and give me an estimate....  Damn Toyota....  I shouldn't have gotten out of bed yesterday....  Least Amanda made dinner and it was awesome...  And I got to finish watching the Rundown and we watched Honey tonight....  Stoopid tornado siren interupted that towards the end...  Least Heather and Melly wil be here this weekend so I won't get too bored....  hehehehe....  :0)  Anyway I think I'm going to try and ignore these stupid thunderstorms and go to bed....  Laters....

      Ok, I'm tired and Golden Girls is on...  Is someone trying to tell me something there?  :0)  I'm almost done with my graduation announcements...  I've got a few left and I'm almost out of stamps....  So hurry now and send me your address if you want one!  Get em while they last!  LOL....   Seriously, I still have that damn glue taste in my mouth... After most of a smoothie (yes the guy there tried to hit on me again....  Thank God I was on the phone with Becca or I might have been forced to speak to him....  Just cuz you know my name and that we're both from Houston, don't expect me to fall at your feet...) and a cookie and a few sips of DP no less....  Damn, its nasty stuff, I tell ya!   Does the date4/20 have the same meaning as 4:20 I wonder???  And if so is it possible to smoke ALL day??? :0)   So, yeah, Natalie emailed me and I emailed her back and got her phone # so I need to call her in the next couple of days....  Oh, speaking of Nat...  I now know 2 people going to Iraq...  Well one's already there but her hubbie is being shipped out in June...  Reminds me, I haven't talked to Mike or Merc lately....  Last time I heard from either of them they were both in Cali though in completely opposite directions....   I went to bed early last night...  Made it to both my classes...  Ran into Zach for the first time in awhile (ran into Smalls yesterday on the way to class), talked to him for a bit....  Went to the primary....  Filled out a stoopid survey for the stoopid school.....  Had lunch at Subway...  Amazingly enough I ran into Greg.... Wow, he hasn't changed much since I last saw him and Pete and Brian....  I don't think I've seen him since they graduated...  Pete's still in Tyler, Brian is still Brian (Lord love him and help the world.....) and Greg is still dating Casey...  (the biatch....  She's always treated him like shit and yet he stays with him????  I so don't understand...  :0(  )   The cat's acting psycho....  And I've started calling him Butterscotch for some reason....  Becca hit a cat on the way home....  Reminded me of Nat hitting a squirrel i driver's ed and the time I hit a armadillo on the way home from work one night...  Ah, memories....  She and and Rich went to see the Alamo and I had to reassure him that it wasn't a typical Disney flick....   Poor boy was really worried about that....  :0)  I talked to him and I realized how mature he sounded...  I remember back when I used to torment him cuz he was smaller than me (and he's always been like a younger brother...) and now he's graduating high school and way over 6' tall...  Am I feeling the years?  Perhaps the Golden Girls reference will help clarify that for ya....  :0)  Anyway I'm off to see a speech by a special guest speaker for bonus points in Intergrated Methods....  Laters...

      Hi, hi, hi....  Happy Sunday....  I apoligize in advance for lots of misspelled words and funky phrases... I'm tired and I'm still recovering from last night....   Friday, I went to the movies with Mel and saw the Prince and me....  Yesterday, Amanda and Julie came over and convinced me to go to Little Rock witht them for Amanda's B-day party...  So we (Me, Julie, Amanda and Matt) get into to LR bout 3 and go to Dwayne's apartment...  We hang out there, go to Park Plaza mall, and then picked Heather up at 5:30 at her hotel...  We met up with O and Nicole just b4 6 at this placed called Crazy Hibachi....  Turns out to be one of those Japenese resaurants like Benihana's where they cook the food in front of you....  A few tidbits were learned here...  First off Nicole is remarried....  To her best friend (poor man)...  But she has a baby and he's from her first marriage...  Weird...  Julie and Jeremy are engaged...  I knew they were dating, had no clue they were that serious....  Also the steak that that place was kick ass...  Seriously...  I had a piece and I was like groaning, it was soooo good....  Anyway, so after dinner we head down to Markham....  We try this one piano bar Nicole had talked about (her and O had both went home by now and btw without speaking a word to me...  Interesting....).  The bar tender was rude and the drinks sucked (they had nothing frozen!!!).  So we try this other place and they have no frozen drinks either...  So we finally settle on this other place with no cover and a live band (called the Swinging Johnsons...  They also threw condoms out on the floor...  I'm still not sure if it was a joke or innuendo...).  By now I was buzzing....  A couple of Kamikaze's and a margerita and a most of a daquari will do that to ya...  Then I sipped off Dwayne'sLong Island Iced tea too...  Whoo, boy, did I forget how strong THOSE were....  So anyway I danced a time or two...  Dwayne, Julie and Amanda went to play pool....  Heather went to the ladies room and I text messaged a couple of my friends and one to my sister....  A creepy weird guy tried to hit on me...  Ew ew ew...  Anyway Heather came back and she Matt and I went for a walk and wound up on the river bank...  Talking and stuff....  Amanda called us and they came down from the bar....  We all walked along the river bank and found a playground...  We immediately (most of us anyway) started to explore it and play...  Then we went to Heather's hotel and hung out for a bit...  Then on the way back to Dwayne's to drop him off, we ran out of gas....  2 am, on the interstate, in a bad part of town we run out of gas....  It was an intersting experience to say the least....  So we finally drop Dwayne off and get going and finally get back to campus about 4:30 this morning....  And I finally made it into bed about 5....  I woke up at 10 and I couldn't go back to sleep...  And my stupid nose wouldn't quit running...  So I'm going to eat my left overs and watch Cold Creek Manor with Mel...  Just as soon as I shower that is.....  :0)  Laters!

      First and foremost a shout out to Melly...  The world's greatest roomie...  Even though she had to go and graduate, the goober....   So on the the show....  :)  I talked to Chuck and Melly last night for the first time in a while...  (Thanks for pulling me out of the doldrums, yo...)  Talked to Chuck about the Amanda situation...  He had some suggestions...  Not sure if I like them, but he was trying to be helpful....  Melly and I relived the past with talk about the MMC, way back inthe day and all the peeps that are famous or nearly famous today that were originally on the show....  Kinda cool...  Melly also told me that my last entry, was really enlightening...  And I've thought about it and it really is...  I mean, my dad's still a big part of me, even though he's dead, cuz I mean I look like him (except I'm a girl), I have his mannerisms and I think like him...  I've got his blood running through my veins and his last name (least till I get married and then it may change, maybe not...).  Anyway other stuff...  I realized something yesterday...   I was on GW and someone said something about being mean (prob. Kevin....) and I made a crack about love hate relationship....  I just wanna clear something up...  Kevin and I have a very unique friendship...  Its not your usual hey how are you, talk for a while and go your seperate ways....  But Kevin and I are a weee bit different...  I'm a nice person (people always like to talk about how sweet I am - not to sound conceited...) and most of my conversations are normal (ie hey whats up, etc...).  But with Kevin, its different....  We go at each other, claws extended....  Interesting, yes, normal, no...  Which I don't really mind, I actaully rather enjoy our talks...  So I just wanted to take this chance to announce something...  Drum roll please....  Kevin is my newest boy toy....  Hehehehe....  Of course he didn't know it till now....  But there you have it....  Any other applicants?  Brian?  ;)  Anyway I'm off like a prom dress...  Laters!

       WARNING: This entry is very introspective and may make you teary-eyed!!!!!   Ok, so I don't usually post twice in a day, but I had a moment earlier and I just wanted to share....  I was playing with the cat earlier and one of my pictures fell off the table somehow...  It was the old pic of my dad, me and Lauren way back before Linz was born...  The stoopid cheap frame broke so I had to go to Walmart and get a new one....  But my moment....  Extreme Makeover home was on and I fell in love with Ty AGAIN....  He was sooo sweet and the little old lady was so grateful and so happy...  It was greatness...  I shed a tear or two, as well...  (my rule - no one cries alone around me, whether it be on TV or up close and personal....)  Still not my moment, yet...  So I went to pick up my picture and I toss the frame and I look at the picture and I realize, I had almost forgotten what he looked like....  He died in '90 and I've had this pic for a few years, but I've never looked at it...  I mean really looked at it until tonight....  I stared so hard, that the picture went out of focus...  Have you ever done that?  Been so intense in a task or a look that everything else just faded out?  Its one hell of an experience...  I wondered when I was looking at him, what he was thinking when that picture was taken (it was predivorce and pre Linz - so who knows?).  Had he come to the realization that he was alcoholic yet?  Did he have ulcers yet?  Did his smile looked a little forced or was that just my imagination?  Was he always so unhealthy looking or was that me?  Then I wondered about the funny little things like I wonder if Lauren knows how silly she looks almost bald?  Or that I look good without bangs and glasses....  And why in the world did mom dress us so identically all the time? (once Linz came along it got worse until we all rebelled when I was in jr. high....)  Anywho I went to Walmart and got a new frame, I don't like it as much, but it'll do for now....  But I still wonder if the image I've always had of Daddy was a fantastic image that was almost larger than life or just the image every little girl has of her daddy, who can do no wrong.....  Yeah, anyway....  Thats really all for now...  Laters.....

      Ok, first and foremost since he was complaining about it....  SHOUT OUT TO KEVIN....  (Better, dear? ;) )  Sorry yall he thinks he's the greatest thing since sliced bread, but what he doesn't realize is that my heart belongs to Dennis Quaid?  LOL...  Love ya too, Kevey-Kev!  Other shout outs...  Katie, I love the new colors on your blogger!  Lavinia, you da woman!  Kara, and Sarah its had to say which of you is cooler!  JD - You may be from Georgia but you're all right by me...  Jason and Brian, Yankees God love em, but cool nonetheless...  And Stu, dude, you own!   Ok, enough with the shoutouts....  On with the show... Last night AIM was being a bitch and kicked me off, my connection timed out and then my freakin' computer froze on top of that!  How annoyed was I?  Very...  So I went to bed....  Made it to my 8 oclock, found out I have a C in there....  Came home, at breakfast, went to EC 2...  Aye, now there's a worrisome class...  I'm not sure how well I can do....  If I don't make at least a C I can't graduate...    And Lord knows I'm not having that!  After class I went to an OSEA meeting.....  Anyone wanna buy some raffle tickets?  :0)  Came home, had lunch, checked my email and chilled on GW....  Watched Ellen and Wayne Brady....  Made dinner after Oprah and talked to Heather....  We had a nice long discussion about Amanda and her new man, and some old history that we'd been through thats very similar....  As well as about her wedding and fiancee and my classes.....  We didn't really come up with a solution to the problem but I feel better just talking about it...  Amanda went home for the night and took Andrew and his friend David with her....  Umm...  Okay....  You've known the boy like 2 weeks and you're already taking him home?  Wtf?!?!?  I don't care if your brother wants to meet him, Joe wants a lot of stuff doesn't mean he'll get it all....  Geez..... In other news...  I finally watched Far From Heaven....  Um, next time I rent a movie, remind me to read the back cover....  I don't mind movies that are made to look old, or gay guys, but the drama and the fact Dennis Quaid was a gay guy was a little hard for me to swallow...  (he had no gay mannerisms, which even if he was trying to hide it, should have been apparent....  And making out with the guy in the office didn't count....  Any guy can make out with any other guy (they don't though, thank goodness....).)  Lets see what else?  AI is on a little bit, but I'm finding I don't care so much about that...  So I think I'll watch Friends....  O, o, before I forget....  Becca, I actually used something you taught me today!!!!  I cut the kitty's nails all by myself!  He wasn't sure what to think, but now he can't scratch us up as badly....  And he can't climb on stuff (like us) and he gets this cute bewildered look on his face, like what the hell....  Its adorable....  :0)  Then Amanda almost yelled at me...  I hope you didn't use nail clippers....  I'm like, duh, yeah, George I did, that's what you're supposed to do...  She's like no, he's a kitten you're supposed to use special kitten trimmers...  I'm like what the f????  Anyway enough of that....  I have a 3 day weekend and a bunch of work to finish up/do and an invite to Little Rock on Saturday night for Amanda Y.'s B-Day party...  So we'll see what happens...  For now I'm just sleeping late tommorrow and meeting my IL group at 11 to work on our case studies....  Thats all for now....  Laters!

      I forgot to mention yesterday about the whole Zach/Josh/Mel thing....  I don't kow how, but its cute anyway....  Mel and I were coming back from Hastings the other day and we see Josh and Zach out jogging together, now I love them both dearly, but they are far too pretty (esp. Zach since he grew his hair out...).  Then we saw CPD and I joked that we should stop the cop and tell him to arrest Josh and Zach, cuz they were far too pretty to be guys...  See, cute, huh?  :0)  I also ran into the other Zach and talked to him a bit...  He's working full time out at the winery and so he hasn't had a lot of time to hang out...  Too bad he's fun to hang with....   Also haven't talked to Monkey or ONeal lately....  Wonder how they are?  O, ran into Mark today on the way to class and guess who hit the button for me?  Mark of course...  He did and then looked at me and was like old habits die hard...  And I was like thanks for calling me old, biatch...  Funny moment of the morning there...  GW still isn't working, damnit....  I don't know why, it just isn't....  Angel's on...  AI was on a bit ago, but I didn't really watch it...  I'm finding its not as great as it was...  And I can't figure out why I had a thing for John Peter Lewis...  I thought he was cute!?!?  Umm, ok...  Call it a weak moment....  Oh, well, its on to bigger better things...  No class Friday...  I'm not going to the primary 2morrow so I have like a 3 and a half day weekend....  Heather and Rashaun are supposed to be in town this weekend for Alumni weekend and Heather's supposed to bring Katari...  Speaking of which I need to email her...  Hm....  I was going to have a Dennis Quaid movie marathon today, with Frequency and Cold Creek Manor and Far from Heaven if I had time....  But I fell asleep right after lunch and woke up at 5 or so...  So I only watched Shaft...  Not a Dennis Quaid movie, but classic nonetheless....  Let's see its baseball season...  Haven't picked my teams yet, but of course the Astros on the list, just cause they're my hometown team....  Other than that I haven't got any favorites at the moment....  Depends on what other teams have guys with the best butts I suppose...  hehehe...  I'm soo bad, but I'm sooo good at it!  :)  Sweet, Knight Rider reference on Angel....  Hehehe...  Not much else going on here....  Laters!

      I've come to realize in the last few days how much I've been isolating myself from my friends...  A wee bit with my friends at home (not so much Nate and the boyz, or Becca or my GW peeps....  And W and Doug and Scott and both B's, but more Natalie....  Ok, maybe only Natalie.....), but more here at school...  I've run into a bunch of people I used to hang out with a lot (last year/last semester) and they've noticed I'm not nearly so....  visible on and around as I usually have been....  There's only a month left of class left so I don't know what to really do if anything at all about the whole situation... Speaking of friends....  I've been thinking about writing Natalie for the last week or so, but I haven't done it...  I don't know why, we've always been friends and gone for weeks and weeks without talking (though never this long)...  She emailed me back in February and I emailed her back but never got an answer...  I was going to call her when I was in town, but with the whole thing with the car and Texarkana stuff, I never got around to it....  How does one repair a friendship such as ours, I don't know...   Geez, I'm soo not in the know anymore....    Actually I do know something....  I have a 3 day weekend (actually 3 and half since my last class is over by 11 Thursday morning....).  It could have been 4 if Mel had been right about the assessment day thing...  Its supposed to be a gorgeous weekend, so that oughta be greatness.... :0)  Not much is happening, other than I missed my 8 oclock this morning since I overslept...  I thought about making dinner but got Sonic instead...  The cat's spent most of his day napping in my bed...  Makes me wanna take a nap too...  Having him around has made me realize I've missed having a cat, even thouh I'm not a cat person...  How weird is that?   And no Bec, I don't want Pecos back, thank you very much!  :0)  And as per Kevin's request, there is no mention whatsoever of Dennis Quaid...  No mention of Dennis Quaid movie marathons, how good looking he is...  No nothing...  See Kev, I actually listen sometimes.... :0)   The whole situation with Amanda with her new amour I believe has been resolved....  I hope...  I really should like his greasy, smelly friend more than I do...  He digs Doug Moreland and punk rock...  Or not...  :0)  GW isn't working for some reason....  I finally hooked up my new speakers today and they ROCK!!!  I also put my new PG sticker on my car....  Gilmore Girls is on so I'm watching it.....  She just made a drunk dial...  Go Rory...  Not that I know anything about drunk dials, mind you...  I NEVER drink any sort of alcoholic beverage....  Yeah, right....  Anyway thats about it for this evening....  Laters....

      Ok, so a few apologies first and foremost...  To everyone....  I wrote that last entry at midnight last night which is technically today, but I kept referring to Friday as yesterday....  To Kara, whom I accidently called Katie on my tagboard....  (I blame the drugs!!!!) And to Becca, since I talked to Linz tonight and she said she didn't want Pecos...  But she does want a pet for her apartment, just not that particular pain in the ass....  :0) Happy Easter yall!!!  Hope the Easter bunny was good to you!  And since I last posted I realized a few things that needed some adding to and/or tweaking...  Numero Uno, the Alamo paid such close attention to detail that they even got the fact that Sam Houston rode a white horse named Saracen and that Santa Anna after San Jacinto, tried to disguise himself as a regular soldier...  Though they said nothing about the mulatto chick that had been 'destracting him' ;) and came to be known as the 'Yellow Rose of Texas'....  Anyway enough Texas history for the moment...  Also I realized that I was wrong about the voice thing for Dennis Quaid and Bleu....  Bleu has a smoker's voice all rough n stuff....  And Dennis Quaid has a husky voice with a hint of an accent...   Speaking of Dennis Quaid *sigh*...  He was mentioned in one of my ftrashy romance novels today...  They were watching the Big Easy (God I love that movie!!!) and talking about one of the sex scenes...  Thought that was sorta interesting.... I need a pedicure, yo...  My feet are not quite pretty enough to be wearing my flip flops and stuff like I have been....   Does anyone else find the combination of Bob Dylan and Victoria's Secret strange???  First the commercials and now theres some sort of deal about a Bob Dylan CD at VS...  Weirdness....   Oh, now I can say I know 4 people who have been in a Mexican whorehouse (though why I would want to I don't know....)...  Isn't that just lovely?  Even lovelier is the fact one of them is one of my exes....  Though it occured AFTER we'd broken up, thank God....  Ok, I'm off to do an article review thats due tommorrow....  Laters!

      I realized shortly after I posted yesterday, GW is down till 4-11-04...  It worked briefly enough for me to post that and a few other things as weill...  So if you do want to read that story you'll have to wait till after 4-11.....  Sorry, yall....   Last night I went to see Ella Enchanted...  Was going to see the Alamo, but the drugs and the rain mixed with darkness screwed me up so I didn't think I could drive the 20 miles required to go see the Alamo...  So I stayed in town and saw Ella Enchanted instead....  Its a damn cute movie....  Take your mom to see it for Easter, hell, take your sisters, aunts, and cousins while you're at it!  Yes its a chick flick type movie...  But funny nothing less...  So I went to bed at 10:30 last night...  Thats the earliest I've been to bed since like jr. high.....  Course I kept waking up like every 2 hours till like 6 this morning when I finally managed to sleep till 10 or so.... (so being 11 ish...)  Got up, showered, and went to Russellville, and FINALLY saw the Alamo....   By the way, I've officially taken myself off my meds....  I noticed very little change and the side effects were hella bad....  So the Alamo...  WOW...  Dude, that is one helladrama...  From the beginning to the end....  I hardly noticed the passing of time (it was 2 and half hours long almost and most of yall know how bad my ADD is, and if you don't then you do now....).  I'm a huge Texas History buff and to my knowledge they got everything right on...  And they showed the point of views of the Mexicans and the Texicans....  It was incredible...  It had the guy that played the bad guy (Johnny Tapia) in Bad Boys 2 as Juan Seguin, and Billy Bob Thornton as Davey Crockett, Jason Patric as Jim Bowie and Dennis Quaid as Sam Houston...  It showed that these men weren't just myths or larger than life heroes, it showed them as men with faults like any other...  It was greatness...  I left the theater moved beyond belief and walking a little taller...  I'm from Texas, screw you....  :0)  Hell mi familia has been in Tejas since 1832...  My dad's family has been in and around Seguin since then....  I've got Texas Rangers (law enforcement not the baseball team), Army, Navy, and Marine personnel, and teachers in my family tree....  I was born in Texas, raised in Texas, and I'm going to die there one day (not anytime soon, hopefully)...  But anyway I also left the theater crushing on Dennis Quaid (again!)...  I don't know why but every time I see that man....  *sigh* He and Bleu both have voiesI can listen to all day....  Bleu's got more a whiskey rough voice and Dennis Quaid is more... smooth I suppose....  Anyway so its almost one and Amanda just left with her new crush and one of his friends to go play pool...  There's something about him that makes me uneasy I'm not sure what...  Its just an instinct, I suppose...  And after all these years I've begun to trust my instincts again, so I think I'll just stay on my guard, just in case...  The fact I heard a little girl (ok so she was like 15 or 16) say here comes trouble (and look like she meant it) and said his name as he walked by, so I know she was referring to Amanda's Andrew....  Yeah that didn't help my discord.....  Besides he's a townie and I know from experience how bad that can go....  Anyway on a brighter note, I text messaged a bunch of people last night before the movie started, including one to Lauren...  She had Honeybrowne and Reckless Kelly (2 of our favorite bands) at a sorority thing a week or 2 again and I hadn't talked to her about it yet, so I texted her instead...  She sent me a reply early this morning...  And I quote...."I was drunk, I don't remember much...  But I'm sure it was good..."  Silly girl....  Anyway thats about it for now....  Laters!

      So I'm bad, bad girl...  I haven't written all week...  Life has been a bit hectic....  School and stuff have taken up the majority of my time... Then when I'm not in class, I'm sick and/or asleep....  Then on top of that a friend of the family is in  the hospital....  If you really wanna know the whole story there:   http://www.galleywinter.com/main/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=17361 (copy and paste it...)  Yeah, its soo non glorious...  Then Thursday, I went to the emergency room cuz I was having trouble breathing...  All they would tell was that I had lots of mucus...  Well duh, dude it allergy season..  So they gave me a couple of Rx's and told to follow up with my regular physician....  Thanks for the astute observations dude....   So my friend W called while I was waiting and I told him I would call him back I was in the ER...  He freaked, and called "Brandon" who in turn called me freaked out....  Of course I was asleep at home by the time he called with my phone on silent so he freaked out on my voice mail....  I called W b4 I fell asleep so he explained to "Brandon"...  So then when I woke up I called "Brandon" back and got lectured....  Lucky me...  I swear he was acting as though we were still dating it was weird...   Nice but weird...  Especially with the whole dating another girl thing....  I'm not really sure what to think on that front....    On with happier subjects though....  I slept with a man Thursday afternoon for the first time in months...  He was blond and cute...  And he weighs about 7 pounds and his name really is Trouble....  If you haven't figured it out by now, he's a cat....:0)  I was taking a test Thursday morning and one of the questions was name two kinds of movement and the first thing that came to my mind that I almost put were 'drunk and sober'...  Yeah, that would have been interesting...   I've also made up a new language...  Canuckology....  Its all Jason's fault....  Instead of certain words you use Canuck instead...  I.E. Instead of  F You its Canuck you....  Gotta love how humorous that is... Got my new PG hat and sticker in the mail, as well as my new speakers and graduation annoucements... Donald Trump has something in common with my dad....  The hairstyle is similar and the whole aura of power....  weirdness.....  And Trump's hand thing when he says your fired is exactly like Emeril does with "Bam"..... Was watching Nashville Star today it was a rerun of last weeks with Willie Nelson songs....  George Canyon sang one of my faves, 7 Spanish Angels....  I'd buy his record and he's not too bad to look at....  There was also a sign in the audience Nashville loves Willie and I was like, who DOESN'T love Willie?  The Warren Brothers told Jennifer Hicks (why does that name sound familiar?) that she cried more than Chris Cagle....  Much as I love him (Lavinia - you know I do!!!) I think they had a point....  It seems every time I see him on TV (not in videos), he's sniffling and/or on the verge of crying....  On this season of Nashville Star I'm predicting Brent Keith as the winner...  I don't like him, but he has though pretty boy (read - GAY) Nashvegas seems to like and look at the name...  Is he related to Toby Keith?!?!?   All right that's about it for now...  Except for my shout outs.... Kevin is a doof, but I love him anyhow...  Katie, Sarah, Lavinia, and Kara ROCK...  Jason, maybe a Canuck but cool in my book....  Brian will always be the Tampon God....  Becca, nothing but love for ya!  Happy belated B-Day, John, sorry I missed it...  Meghan B. - Happy B-Day girlie!!!!!! If I forgot anyone I apologize in advance.....  :0) I'm going to see The Alamo tonight whoo hoo!!!! :0) Laters!!!!!!

      So I really shouldn't be blogging at the moment....  I have a file folder game due tommorrow at noon and I've barely even started....  But here I am and here I'll stay....  I slept till almost 2 today so I can stay up late tonight....  :0)  Lets see, Friday on the way to class I fell in lust 4 or 5 times, I think thats a new record even for me....  :0)  So in Behavior Management we watched a video about bullying...  Dr. Betty couldn't get it to work at first and then she got the sound and then the picture to work....  Of course the sound was pumped up and it was some sort of punk song (never expected punk in an educational video I must say....).  She jumped like a foot in the air when the music came blasting through the speakers...  It was freaking hilarious....  Even she laughed about it....  Before last week I wasn't very fond of her, but I'm finding myself liking her more....  Kinda weird, but cuz of the circumstances of the last few weeks, I've seen her true colors so to speak....  Anyway she said something about there being lots of trouble in a class and I instantly thought of Amanda's cat...  LOTS of him in a class....  Then she went on to say something about no trouble and he poofed out of my mental pic....  Kinda funny...   Lets see what else?  Oh, Rashaun was up for the weekend and I spent most of yesterday talking to him...  He and Zuri are finally engaged and they plan to live in Dallas for 2 years starting in the fall....  Then I went to see Jersey Girl with Melissa last night....  It was sweet and sad at the same time, I couldn't stop tearing up....   I came home in the mood to watch some senseless violence and so I went out and bought The Rundown....  Hotties and senseless violence, the perfect combination....   Sean William Scott is right up there with Paul Walker on the hotness scale.... OOOOO, before I forget....  I talked to "Brandon" Thursday and we're cool again....  I'm still hurt but I understand his reasoning better....  So yeah, I'm Alison and I'm single and ready to mingle....  How you doin'? ;0) Had a weird dream the other night...  Actually a few weird dreams....  Last night there was the one about Kid Rock in the Old West....  A few nights ago it was shopping with Jackass in JcPenney's....  Weirdness.... Anyway back to doing homework.....  Laters!

      I've had the world's worst time getting motivated to do anything this weekend....  Part if it is just out and out tiredness and part of it is the fact I'm scared my stoopid car will break down   AGAIN  ...  And I have no more tows left with AAA if I do...  Dammit...  I did go to Walgreens twice testerday, Blockbuster, Kinkos and Petsmart...  So I suppose thats a step in the right direction even if there all within a couple of blocks of the townhouse... I was going to try to go to the zoo or the ASPCA to look at animals, but the only ways I could find were on the freeway...  I know you don't have to take the freeway to the zoo, I just have to figure out the way again...  Oh yeah, don't know if I mentioned it or not...  My car's not allowed on the freeway..   Course getting to Memorial park where thespeed limit is 40 mph makes me nervous now...  Since the faster I go the louder that stoopid whine gets...  I swear that is the world's most annoying sound!!!!!  Ok, enough about my car....   Lala drove in from Ft worth Friday and I was gonna spend some time with her Friday night but she took off with Linz and I wound up watching the Haunted Mansion (finally) and Monty Python and the holy grail...  Not as funny as I remember it...  Talked to Chuck, actually I had to call him to figure out if I had the right Monty Python...   Speaking of funny...  My mom called me drunk Thursday night...  and asked me to come pick her up about 20 minutes away over by the old house...   Bewteen getting linz and going to pick her up she called no less than 4 times and her teacher friends that were with her called me twice...  That was some funny shiznit...  How often can you say you were your mom's DD???  :0) Talked to Mel and Melly in the last few days...   Talked to Becca too...  Mainly to tell them this story....  Did a bit of catching up too...  Meg emailed me about a potential girls weekend at the end of June....  That would be too much fun...  Our little group set free on the city of Dallas...  Quick someone warn the DPD!!!  :0) Sean and Nathan are coming into town this week for a week or so....  I have to call the HPD and let them know...  ;)  Doug at the Firehouse Thursday, Harry Potter Friday, and Firehouse again for Honeybrowne and the Lost Trailers....  Sean's pressing me for an answer...  Nat's got me going to one of those singles mingles 104 does at Jillians (or is it Gillians??)...  Geez...  I don't think anyone wants me to be single...  I want to date around a bit... Which I suppose that would let me do...  I mean you aren't required to MARRY anyone you meet there...  Hmmmm....  Keep my options open I guess?  Thats about it for now really...  Laters...

      And the saga continues....  Both the car and my love life...  Though the latter may not be written about much as I know at least one other person involved reads this....  The car I got back on Friday, Mom went to Brownwood....  I went to Matt Powell/Randy Rogers at the Firehouse, though I only stayed for Matt...  Flirted with a guy from Randy's band, can't recall his name offhand...  Saw M and he seemed surprised to see me since he's friends with B2...  I told him just cuz we broke up didn't mean I was gonna boycott music...  Silly man....  Went to Linz's apartment about midnight and watched Win a Date with Tad Hamilton even though I had already seen it with Mel...  Went home about 2 am, and couldn't sleep....  Saturday went to see Bleu and Stoney at the Firehouse...  Awesome times as always....  I got there about 9, heard a couple of Stoney's songs, talked on my cell phone quite a bit....  Bleu came on about 10 or so and rocked as always...  He's such a cutie pie...  He had a new guy  in the band, Matt...  Hottie-patatie there...  If only I didn't already know Matts in general are trouble with a capital T (the majority not all...).  Didn't get to talk to him but shot the shit with Stoney and Jeremy (his fiddler) for a bit...  Then Bleu and Stoney went on acoustic and just swapped turns playing songs, occasionally joining in to sing with the other....  Stoney was drunk and hilarious...  They play off each other sooo well.  It was hilarious how they were talking about Stoney and Wade arguing over Bleu....  I couldn't stop laughing...  Called Bec and let her listen to a few songs...  Finally it got shut down about 220 or so with Stoney drunkenly cursing...  Still sorta funny, then Bleu led him off and I left...  Got home and got to bed about 3 am....  Sunday I don't remember so well...  I know I hung out with Linz...  We went to the Park and then went to see a late showing of Shrek 2...  Monday...  Hung out with Linz, made a shitload of phone calls about my car, insurance claims, and my grades (which I still have not gotten) and then went to school to help Mom pack up her room and then she took me to Pappasitos for dinner...  Gawd I love those chicken enchiladas with salsa verde....  Today I hung out with Linz, watched you got served (sucked ass) and then went to the Galleria (got complimented on my shirt "Why exersice my body for something my mouth did? - some funny shit right there)...  Came home, watched Miracle and made dinner.... Talked to Nat today too...  EVENTUALLY we are going to get together it just hasn't worked out yet....  Pretty boring day... Oh, yeah, Thursday I got my hair cut!!!!  Its sooo cute and I'm loving it...  I got 2 inches cut off, and more layers added, so now it looks like I actually had body in my hair!!!  Whoo hooo!  Of course ponytails are a wee bit harded but hey who cares....  I love my hair!!!!  :0)  Thats really all thats been going on lately...  Unless I go into this weird ass dream I had about Brody last night...  It was him and B2 (probably brought on by the drama last weekend) based on a conversation we had that could have gone entirely different direction...  Put your mind in the gutter, next to mine and you'll figure out part of the dream...  Also I notice I've been cursing alot more and I don't know why...  I still need to find a job...  (anyone know of anything in Houston that requires a college degree and I can work around kids??  Oh, yea and it has to be part time so I can get certified to teach at the same time...  Not too much to ask right?  :0) )  Anyway thats really it for now...  Laters!!!!

      There oughta be a law against being up this early....   Course this particular feeling could be from lack of sleep on my part...  Went to bed at like 2:30 and woke up at like 6:30...  I forgot how icky 4 hours of sleep made me feel...  Sure its only been a few weeks since I last did it, but thats besides the point!  :0)  I had to though in order to borrow Mom's car today...  I'll explain about mine in a sec.... Linz and I had this talk to other day about how we felt like we were just visiting West Gray, even though her apartment is down the street and she's lived there almost a year...  And Mom's lived here at the townhouse almost 2 years...  But I was driving down Memorial on the way home (tons faster than I 10...) and I realized how right she was...  I felt like I was on my way home, and I almost turned down our old street...  Wow...  I haven't done that in at least a year... Also, I'm officially registered to take the THEA (TASP) test on June 19th at U of H Downtown...   Found out for any program I want to get into I have to have that passed and stuff...  I'm reordering my scores so I can see for sure if its only the math part I failed (I'm pretty sure it is the only one though...).  So I have to have that and my transcript PLUS the application and appplication fee for any program I try to get into...   As well as a criminal background check thingy...   Want anything else, my first born maybe???  :0) Ok so my car...  The ongoing drama...  They fixed the window, after fixing it found the one that had been put in in March wasn't a Toyota part, so it wasn't covered under warranty, but the job was already done so there was nothing else that could be done...   They found there is yet MORE damage from back in March, so I had to get the insurance company involved yet AGAIN...  I have to call the guy back this morning to take care of some stuff....  Then one of the adjusters can go out to Don McGill and ok the repairs and in a few days I can go pick it up...  Hopefully on Friday....  Otherwise my plans Friday night might be shot...  Though if I don't have it back on Saturday, I'm crawling to the Firehouse on my hands and knees in order to see Bleu....  And don't think I won't....  :0)  Anyway I told my Mom (in a moment of weakness) that if the car wasn't ready I'd go with her to Brownwood...  What was I thinking???   Lets see what else...  Went to the park and walked last night and then ate at Becks....  Oh, so exciting...   I have a bunch of phone calls to make today (much like yesterday...  Lucky me....) and then some errands to run before I meet mom at school and help her pack up her classroom stuff...  Then we're off to Escalante's for din-din...   Then hopefully we'll get back in time for me to be able to stream the feed off of 92.1's website,  so I can hear at least PART of Bleu's acoustic thing at the Icehouse...  :0)  Anywho thats about it for now...  Its off to make phone calls I go....  Laters!!!!

      Wow, 2 posts in 24 hours...  Be ef ing impressed...  Course part of the reason is cuz I'm board outta my goard...  Waiting for Toyota to call me back and tell me when my car will be ready, so I don't really want to get on the phone and have them call me but the line's busy....  Besides I have no idea how to use call waiting...  I've never had to use it so why bother knowing about it?  I also have to make a few other phone calls to find out how to get certified and to Nat to say hi....   I just read Scott's thoughts for the first time since I've been home...  Wow, I forgot how much he uses the word fuck....  Almost missed the season finale of Charmed last night...  I went to Krogers and Blockbuster and at 730 rushed home...  (turns out dinner wasn't ready when I finished that last entry - she was just calling me to get to to run some errands for her...)  Dinner was ready, so I ate quickly and caught the end of Charmed...  Watched Calendar Girls...  Also watched Step into Liquid and part of Loose Change...  (both surf movies for those that don't know...)  I had just talked to Sean and Brody both so I was sorta in a surfy type mood...   I can't do it, but most of my guy friends are surfer boys so I like being able to understand them a bit better...   Found out Don has a solo CD out...  Rob is a sweetheart (knew that b4 but just relearned that last night...).  Jesse Billuer (sp??) has balls of steel...  Dude's paralyzed surfing 2 years ago and was surfing (sorta improvised board where he laid on his tummy and got pushed into waves...) a few monthes ago...  Wow.  Co-co makes a good bad ass wanna be...  He hates it when I call him Co-co...  Wonder why that is?  :0)  I don't know why I ever thought the Malloy brothers look nothing alike...  They do extremely so...  Keith and Chris have the same eye and hair color and the same body build, while Dan has the same face structure as Chris, same smile and even though he's a bit taller, the same build...  All gorgeous as hell...  Chris and Dan have such easy smiles and Keith has that whole quiet....  thing going...  There is just something about him that just sorta....  I don't know.... calls to you?  He's got those piercing blue eyes and that lovely blond hair that just sorta falls into his face...  Meanwhile Dan I find out is a musician...  Chris draws and has opened his own company...  Damn why do these boys have to be so talented???  I think this may be the only set of brothers that I've had a crush on every single one at some time or another...  Wow....   Also I didn't realize (well I had heard but never seen...) that there was actually surfing in Wisconsin...  Someplace called Oshkosh on Lake Michigan...  Hey Brian, ever tried that chit??  :0)  Anyway, enough of the surfers for now...  Stoopid Toyota hasn't called me back yet...  I think I might have to call them in the next few minutes....   Oh, back to surfers for a sec...  Sean.  Love him to death, but the boy wants to set me up...  I've written what I think of that particular concept and I told him in no uncertain terms what I thought of it then and what I still think of it...  He was like and when was the last time you had a date?  Um....  I couldn't answer cuz I don't remember...  For the last year I've been so involved with the whole B2 thing (B2 is his new name now for those that didn't know...) with the are we aren't we thing...  I haven't been ready to date...  Then with school on top of that, I haven't had time to date...  Now I'm home and he's like what stopping you now?  I really don't know.  Maybe I've been making excuses hoping to get back together with B2?  Maybe its the fear factor?  I haven't dated someone else in so long, dating's sort of a scary prospect...  Anyway I did promise to at least thing about letting him, just for the sake of sorta getting out there again...  Getting my feet wet so to speak....   He pushed me for a deadline and I told him by the time he came to town I'd have my mind made up...  Brody didn't like the idea too much but with our history he's bond not to like any idea that involves me dating someone thats not him...  Anyway I'm gonna go call Toyota back and make my other phone calls...  Laters!

      Anybody want a bottle of Jaeger?  :0)  Its like the only bottle of liquor I have left and I'm sure as hell not gonna drink it...  That stuff makes me ill...  Nasty ass, liquorice (sp??) stuff...  So lets see whats happened since Wednesday?  Not alot...   :)  Car's in the shop...  Kind of limits what ya can do, ya know?  So Friday I was supposed to get it back..   But the part hadn't come in and isn't expected in till at least Monday (2morrow)...  So we've been a 1 car family all weekend...  And I have to say its been interesting to say the least....  I was going to go see Bleu Friday night in Galveston...   But by the time Mom got back with the car, I was a bit in my cups...  Then she said I couldn't borrow her car to go any further than a mile away...  Got my back up there for a sec...  I couldn't even go to the Firehouse to see Cooder Graw...  Well ok fine then...  I'll do shots instead...  :P  So I watched Love Actaully Friday night and talked to some of my GW peeps for a bit...  Then about 11 or so remember I was supposed to call Ali Nicole to let her know whether or not I was gonna make it to Bleu...  Damn forgetfulness...  Saturday...  Almost all afternoon was spent cleaning...  Turns out we aren't going to Galveston till one day this coming week...  As long as its not Wednesday I don't care....   Wonder if CJ had his party???  I was supposed to go to that too...  But since I thought I was going to G-town I told him I couldn't go...  Damnit...  So instead we cleaned and I went to see Mean Girls (again) with Linz...  Came home, talked to Nathan (egads I miss that boy! and the rest of the boys too....).  He's gonna try to come to town in the next week or 2...  He made fun of my most recent crush...  Told me I only wanted him for his shopping skillz....  Normal conversation for us...  :0)  I asked him if he would be bringing anyone with him....  Very nonchalantly...  He saw right through it and was like, am I bringing Keith or any of the Malloys? No.  Don, probably not, Jack Johnson (yes he does actually know Jack Johnson...), nope, Sean maybe and Ramon, not sure...  He knows me sooo well!!!!  :0)  So I get off the phone with him and talk to B1 and 2...  Wow...  Pretty amazing to talk to both of them in one night...  B1 had just gotten home from Galveston, he'd been there all day surfing...  B2 was in Dallas playing a gig (are they still called that?!?!)...  Both were doing well and we made plans (not all 2gether of course they'd kill each other over me....  DON'T ASK (its a long complex tale...) ) for sometime in the next week or so...  Linz came back over and we wound up hanging out and stuff...  Today we got Baby and went out to lunch at LaMadeleine and went to see 13 going on 30...  Pretty cute movie....  Mark Ruffalo is a hottie...  Came home and Mom is looking up stuff on certification for teaching (which I have been looking up myself- she just doesn't seem to believe that...).  She seems to want to keep me in H-town for a a year or 2 at least...  While I'm thinking move out and a have a job by the end of 2004 if not then at the latest beginning of 2005...  So yeah, we have to get everything figured out before we fight about something needlessly...  Checked my email and got a long ass one from Kevin...  Sounds like he's going through some stuff like I went through working retail....  Let's see...  Mom's making dinner and I need to go to Soundwaves...  Wonder if they're closed yet?  Hm....  I love that place it sells CDs/DVDs new and used AND its a surf shop besides....   And since they closed down Shannon's in the mall I have nowhere else to go unless I'm in Corpus or Galveston...  Anyway I'll ramble about surfers and stuff later...  I'm cold, and dinner's ready...  Laters!

      Hi yall....   If you don't see me online in the next day or so its all Lindsay's fault...  She's taking over my room (which includes the computer/internet) in order to study for finals...  So yeah, don't worry if I'm MIA for a bit...  Blame it on my baby sister....  :0) Funny story I almost forgot about...  When I got lost in Okieland last week, I went over the Blue River...  Not spelled right of course, but I laughed anyway...  But at that exact same moment Curtis Lowe came on the radio (A Skynard song Bleu likes to cover)...  That made me stop and then start laughing all over again... I'm taking my car to Toyota today and hopefully it doesnt take them too long to fix it...  And then I can go to Galveston Friday to see Bleu...  Yesterday I went to Cingular and they have to send my phone to the factory so I won't get it back for 3- 4 weeks...  They gave me an equally piece of crap Sony Ericcson till then...  How tempted am I to just go back and buy a new phone???  VERY... So I come home and I seriously thought I was gonna drown on Westheimer the water was so deep in some places...  Got home safely and soundly though...  :0)   I spent like 2 hours on the phone last night and used up most of the battery in the loaner phone (WTF!??!?!?) and now the loaner phone won't charge for some reason...  Nah, I don't want to go  back and throw it in their faces....  Not at all...  (for those that don't know it, that was sarcasm....)  Anyway while I was on the phone with Becca she was looking on the webpage for the Surf Club and found a band called Monkeys Doing it...  That cracked me up...  Still does...  So if you see something about monkeys doing it anywhere...  Thats whats going on...  :0)  Anyway I have to go Linz is back and she wants the room back....  Laters!!!!!

      Its Sunday Houston, here's whats not in todays Chronicle....  :0)  Quick update... Thursday, packed, sorta watched friends (saw the beginning and the end - the important stuff... :0) ) and studied...  Friday took a final, finished packing, went to Ft Worth (got lost in Oklahoma on the way...  The exits aren't numbered worth a damn!!!!).  Ran into Nat after stepping into the lobby or the Renaissance Worthington...  I think I may have been a bit abrupt with her...  I was tired, stressed and hungry, as well as caffeine deprived...  Not my best of moods...  Lauren showed up a few minutes later...  We almost scored free drinks at the bar there...   If only mom hadn't shown up...  Friday night went out to dinner at a little italian place in downtown Ft Worth...  Stopped at this little place called 8 0's, listened to a band for a bit...  We need more places like that in Houston....  Then we went back to the hotel and I fell asleep b4 11!!!  (so we didn't make it to the Stockyards...  Mainly since Lauren said people that hung out there were 'shadesters'.  Her word not mine...  Gotta love Lauren and her unique vocabulary!  I wonder where she gets that from? :0) )  Woke up at 8, watched some TV, got ready for graduation, went to brunch with Lauren and Mom and John (Chapman not Price - far as I know JP was still in Austin...  :0) ).  Lauren gave me a cute little case for my glasses and a cute little cleaning cloth thingy...  Mom gave me my diamond heart necklace she's been teasing me about since she got it like 2 monthes ago...  As well as a nice bit of cash to shop for teacehr clothes with...  Sweet deal!!  So checked out at noon...  Walked around downtown for a bit,went to the the Barnes and Noble (that is one hell of a big B & N!!).  Thought of Kev and Brian there...  In the discount section there was what had to be the world's longest books on the history of baseball...  Kev - you should go get it, its right up your alley and right down the street! :0)  Anyway graduation at 2....   Saw Lauren, Kelly and Saylor, as well as our cousin, James graduate....  There were a few funny moments...  The nursing students had silly string and confetti and threw it when they were announced....   The badn had silly string and confetti too and whenever one of thei friends walked they went wild with it....  Also a few very meloncholy moments...  They honored a woman who had been murdered with a posthumous doctorate, and a girl who was SUPPOSED to have graduated that died last week, had her diploma handed to her mom and sister...  I teared up there...  The whole audience went wild and the guy announcing had a bit of trouble getting to say the next name....  Anyway we left at 4...  Went back to the hotel, and had champagne...  Dropped Lauren off at her apartment and headed home...  Got back to Houston about midnight...  Almost immediately fell asleep...  Course I talked to Linz for a while (she was here studying when we got back...) and then we promptly over slept for mom's breakfast in bed...  Wound up making chicken ceasar salad for dinner and strawberries for dessert....  But guess the first place I went today???  :0)  Cactus...  Got the new Mac CD, Willie live at billy bobs and James Otto...  Then went to B & N for moms presesnt and then on to Krogers for dinner stuff and food for me... Came home, checked the email (found out there was some sort of drama with Katie while I was gone...), made dinner and watched chasing liberty...  Now here I be done blogging for the day and thinking about watching girl with the pearl earring...  :0)  (ok, so maybe this update wasn't so short...  :0) )Laters...

      Ok so would anyone NOT like to give me hard time today?!!?!??  I swear to God, its so damn frustrating...  So first of all I woke up at 8:05(might have something to do with staying up to 230 talking to Kevin and them... ;0) ) and I had a final at 8!!!  Get there at 8:15 and I'm the last one to present my powerpoint...  The stoopid computer gave me trouble and wouldn't find my powerpoint...  So I taught from the handout...  After class the prof. gave me a hard time about what I hadn't and hadn't turned in...  Then I find out that I was supposed to be at graduation practice last night..  I went to the registar and told her...  She then informs me, walking is an 'understood' mandatory part of graduation...  WTF!?!?!  Who the fuck understands that?!?!?!  I've told people all semester I wasn't going to be here for it and then this bomb drops...  Theres some obscure rule that you have to walk the stage as part of the graduation requirements...  So I go to the dean of students and theres a whole hollabaloo...  Its all sorted out as of about 5 or so...  Also Toyota was giving me fits...  In order fix something they messed up I had to pay 32 dollars...  What that heck?!?!!   Anyway...  on to better stuff...  I am going to Ft Worth 2morrow after my final and I'm done packing...  And after my final at 8 am...  Speaking of finals I had one 2day at 11 and I found out this stuff about graduation right before it...  Great timing, huh?  It was 7 questions, all essay and application and it turned out to be almost 6 pages long typed...  And my hands were killing me afterward...  Oh, interesting random tidbit...  Driving to Russellville yesterday to pick up my car, I look at the other part of I 40, the one going the opposite direction, and what do I see?  A surfboard on top of a car...  I didn't see what the state plates were but I cracked up laughing...  Anyway I have to pack, its off to Ft Worth 2morrow and Houston on Saturday after the ceremony...  And then Mel's coming over tonight at 6 to get some dinner and to watch Friends....  Its gonna be sad, but greatness at the same time....  :0)  Laters....

      Ok, so I was talking about this to some friends last night and I still haven't figured out the answer.... WHY do guys shave their heads and then grow facial hair?   Its only made worse by the fact that the now Hal's bald head is white as a freaking sheet...  And now the rest of his face looks way too red...  AND the fact he was wearing a red striped shirt that made him look like a candy cane... (that could be a good or a bad thing depending on how you look at it....    )Too damn bad I somehow find him hot.....    A little shout outage....   SARAH!!!!  I'm still convinced you and Diana from AI are like twins or something...  Becca!   Hey chica!  Lavinia, isn't dressing up your guy friends soooo much fun?? (even with all the grumbling and bitching and moaning they tend to do, the outcome outweighs the complaints....)  :0)  That reminds me I need to shop for teacher clothes when I get home next week....  :0) Ok, thats it for the moment with the shout outs..  I talked to mom the other night and she was in Floresville for the funeral and eating dinner at 930 at night....  Dinner at bed time, bad bad mommy....  :0)  I talked to Cheyenne (my cousin Matthew's oldest daughter) for a while...  I think she's only like 6 years old so our conversation was a lot of hellos and how are yous and me trying not to giggle...  Obviously the child does not talk on the phone a lot...  That bodes well for her parents phone bill in a few years....  :0)  Then I got to talk to Lauren briefly...  Told her we need to get mom drunk this weekend...  She laughed and sorta agreed... My mom is freaking hilarious when she's drunk...  :0)  And I have the feeling she could use a little letting loose and howl time...  But then shes also got a final in her master's class next week so I might just have to drag her to Galveston next week....  Kill two birds with one stone so to speak...  See Bleu and make mom feel better...  Both good in my book.  Especially after the fact she almost broke down when I asked what she wanted for mothers day...  Damn that was really insensitive of me...  I realized how bad it was after I said it...  Anyway....  So anyway someone asked me the other day, what is it that makes guys from Dallas different from guys in any other town?  So I made up a list of different towns and my impressions of the people and the city in general....  Dallas – attitude, stuck up, confidence, and gorgeous (usually but not in all cases….)  Ft. Worth – Billy Bobs, TCU, JP, Lauren, nice town, kind of dry (weather wise)   Austin – laid back, cool, hippyish, fun, crowded…  Houston – a bit of attitude but fun, as well as good drivers (unlike the crazies in Dallas), good people all around….  Corpus Christi – laid back, fun, windy as hell  New Braunfels – awesome times, fun people, lots of drinking…  San Marcos – SWT!!!!!  :0)  San Antonio – eh, its okay…  I always seem to get stuck in traffic there….  Texarkana – Good God, there is like almost nothing there but freeway!!!  I will never again get stuck there...  Nacogdoches – fun times, SFA, cute boys  And for Sean/Nathan and the boyz… :0)  My one California town….  Santa Cruz – cold, cute, and wet…  (it was raining the one time I went there)  Oh, yeah I almost gave away 'Brandon's' identity last night when I was talking to my GW peoples...  I'm just glad no one seemed to notice...  Course now everyone is trying to recall every word I typed, huh?  :0)  So I'm going to get ready, Mel's coming over after her meeting at 1 and we're going out to lunch and to pick up my car in Russellville....  :0)  I'm extremely happy to say the least...   Oh, random fact...  I just learned that a lack of protein can cause a person to get bruised more easily...  :0)  Anywho I think thats about it for now...  Laters!!!

      Ok, so no death talk today...  Today I have boy drama!  Wow, talk about your long time no sees....  :0)  2 different situations, but only one I can do anything about at the moment...  HAL IS BACK!!!!!!!!!  Happy happy joy joy....  :0)  I thought I'd seen his truck on the way back from Pizza Pro, so I called Chuck to ask him if Clif was back yet and it turns out they got back from France last Thursday...  So I exercised tonight and just 'happened' ;) to go down his street...  hehehe...  And there he was in the front yard...  I swear you've never seen a girl so happy as I was...  Still am a bit...  :0)  Europe did nothing but good things, for something already good...  Kinda like chocolate....  :0)  Anyway he's in town visiting (and I think graduating Sat. -didn't have time to ask...).  I got one of his super duper bear hugs....  God I've missed those...  Every other guy hugs me like I'm going to break...  Its ok every now and then, but once in a while a girl (me) wants to feel crushed....  Ya know?  Part of the reason I think I like athletes, they're big and burly (most of em) and even if they give you a oh my gosh you're gonna break soft ass hugs, it still feels good...  :0)  That and Hal's from Dallas, too..  And I've discussed on   MANY   occasions my weakness for the guys in/around/from Dallas...  :0)  Other than that all I've done is study and eat today...  Fun stuff huh?  :0)  O! O! O! I did find out my car is ready to be picked up!!!!!!!  How awesome is that?!?!?!?  I can't go get it till Wednesday, but its ready and I don't have to miss Lala's graduation in Ft Worth like I thought I might have to...  Whoo hoo!!!!  I did find out however J won't be in town...  He'll be playing in Austin...  Stoopid boy...  Anywho, thats about it for now...  Laters.

      So I've kinda run through a gamut of emotions this weekend....  Strangely enough I  STILL  haven't cried...  This is the girl who sobs like a baby at Hallmark commercials....  I did do some research this weekend on grief and its stages, though I can't really classify where I am at the moment, but I did find out its ok not to be crying so I don't feel nearly as guilty as I did....  Though from what I read its only ok as long as you can express your grief in some other way...  I haven't found that way yet, but it won't overwhelm me like after daddy died...  Course then I was only 13 and completely unfamilar with extreme emotions...  Now at 25 I think I experienced the majority of them...   I posted something in the John Wayne and Jesus section of GW and I'm realizing how lucky I am to have friends like the ones I have from GW...  They're all such great people...  They came through when Katie was hurt last week and they're coming through for me now, and I don't know if a lot of them have any idea how much that means to me... Katie, Stu, Kevin, Brian, Sarah, Kara, JD, Lavinia, Jason, Matt and whoever else I might have forgotton, thank you and I love yall so damn much!  Ok, now I'm on the verge of crying.... Anyway.....  I talked to mom tonight and she's still in shock I think and a tad bit angry at her sisters who both live close to (one actaully with) my grandmother....  Turns out she'd been having stroke like symtoms for a week or so before her death... And mom was going through the what ifs, exactly like I did after Tiffy died a few years ago....  Sure, my grandmother and my dog are two completely different things, and I hate to say it but I was closer to my dog than my grandparent....   In the last few monthes I've gotten to be ok with her dying (even though she died 3 years ago)...   I finally let go of my anger at her, at the vet, and at even God....  I quit talking about her in present day terms and I can talk about her now with a smile....  Anyway back to Mamamaw...  Lauren's feeling guilty as I suspected, Mom's goin to Floresville with John 2morrow afternoon, Linz can't go to the funeral cuz of finals, Lauren rescheduled a final to be able to go and I'm   STILL   carless....  And mom agreed it'd be too long and too far a trip for me to try to come....  And I have 2 finals that day....  So yeah I'm still confused about the whole Mamamaw dying thing...  I'm not in denial, I'm not angry, and I'm not in shock anymore...  So what do I feel?  I'm not overwhelming sad, though I do feel kinda melancholy...  I'm oversensitived to mentions of grandparents or people talking to grandparents, but I'm not breaking down in tears.... I'm not exactly jumping for joy, and I'm not really anything in particular when I think about her and her dying....  Does that make me a horrible person???  Cuz I do feel guilty as hell that I don't feel anything...  Its kinda upsetting, cuz I'm usually brutally honest...  I feel like I'm lying to myself, but about what???  Her dying?  No, I know she's dead.  I'm not unaffected...  I know how I should feel, but I also know what I DO feel....  And the two don't mesh....  Any advice or opinions???  Email em I'll take anything....  (sunnychic78@yahoo.com for those that don't know by now)  I don't want to get home next week and my family is suddenly all in tears and I'm the only one thats not (like when daddy died)....    I sure as hell don't wanna get sent to a shrink again like I did then and everyone was convinced something was wrong with me, cuz I didn't grieve in the same way as everyone else....  Damn, I hate death, it just confuses the hell outta me...  Laters....

      All right so I can finally sort out my feelings enough to write them....  I got a call from my little sis this afternoon and after a bit of the usual small talk, she sorta slips in Mamamaw died today and goes on with the conversation...  I'm all like what?  Back up the boat a sec, chica...  She's like yeah, today about noon....  She went in her sleep...  I was shell shocked to say the least....  I acutally went into shock and had to stop myself from curling up in a little ball and avoiding everyone....  I've never been close to my grandmother, but to hear she's dead....  It just sort of rocked my world off its axis....  Her funeral is next Tuesday in San Antonio...   I don't know if I would go even if I could...  (I have 2 finals that day and I'm still carless.)  Not because I didn't like OR love her, just the opposite...  I did... do...  did I suppose, love her....  Sure she drove me crazy with her nosiness but thats what family does...  Its just ever since I heard I can't cry...  Its like I think I should.... Its part of the grief process, and my eyes hurt like I wanted to cry and couldn't and I feel extremely guilty for feeling that way....  So then I've been trying to avoid thinking about it or her at all and now I'm at the point it doesn't feel real, regardless of all the condolecences and stuff...  I actually hearing those....  Mainly cuz I don't really feel like she's dead.  And for now with everything else on my plate maybe thats a good thing...  I've been saying for a while I can't take much more....  And if I let it, this could overwhelm me and I really can't handle it right now...  Maybe that makes me sound like a bit of a bitch or insensitive or whatever, but thats my coping mechanism...  Maybe once I get home it'll hit me, and it'll suddenly be real.... My last living grandparent is dead....  I don't know....  I'm just really confused at this point in time...  And really stressed at the same time....  Anyway, I love you all and I'll talk to you laters!!!!

      Ok, so in the last week let's see what's happened....  I just got back from Dallas about an hour ago....  Good times there....  Linz drove me up when she went to Ft Worth she dropped me at Megs...  Meg's dad made us dinner last night and breakfast this morning...  He's such an awesome cook as always....  Last night we went on a CJ hunt and spent about 2 hours trying to find him...  Called Muston, Chuck H (who is moving to Ft Worth Wednesday w/ Cara to go Seminary...  There's a shocker for ya!), his cell and his parents in San Antonio....  Still no CJ...  So we got ready to go out and headed out...  In the car my Lauren calls me up and says shes lost linz in downtown Ft Worth...  She's in tears and I'm trying to calm her down so I can understand the situation....  She suddenly busts a gut and is like "Gotcha!!".  I got sooo peeved with her, even the fact she was drunk (which a drunk Lauren is a very very very funny Lauren) didn't calm me down...  I hung up on her and a few minutes later we pulled into LaBare's...  Very smoky, 10$ cover, expensive semi decent drinks....  Felt kinda skeezy...  A bunch of hairless (almost completely) guys in the equivalent of tighty whities didn't do much for me personally...  Most of the guys were overly buff, or not very attractive and lap dances cost 20$....  The waiters were cuter but slimeballs....  I got an ice cream (rainbow popsicle) from the 'Ice Cream Man' also the birthday boy, Jamie...  :0)  He was a cutie and the most normal looking stripper there...  We left at like 230 after taking a pic (10$) with the dancers....  I had a sprite and a kamikaze and I was done...  Thats just sad how low my tolerance is now...  Question, what makes a guy decide to be a stripper???  There was one guy who reminded me of my cousin, Gary a few years ago, long stringy hair, cowboy hat, and a gut....  EW EW EW EW...  Another one reminded me of my boys, blond, built, and his get up/gimmick was being a surfer boy...   I tried not to bust a gut when he came out in his wetsuit and surf board, and I so wanted to go call the guys and tell em....  There was another guy who was also a hottie and reminded me of one of the covers of one of my romance novels, who did a Crow/musician type character face make up and all...  Anyway so we get back to Meg's about 3 or so and Mel and I fall into bed and Heather was violently ill (she was just that drunk.... ) Kris took care of her and I think Meg went to bed I'm not sure, since i was out like a light....  So Mr Ball made us waffle for breakfast and then we went and watched movies most of the afternoon...  Linz came and got me at like 3ish and we headed back to Houston and now here I am....  B4 yesterday....  I still have car drama....  The insurance says the problem is with Toyota and they someone there screwed something in too tight or not tight enough....  The rental car didn't work out...  They ran my cards (debit and credit) like 4 times and neither worked...  Later that night I used it at the grocery store and guess what?  NOOOO PROBLEMS AT ALLL!!!!!  Stoopid Hertz and their stoopid machines....  I didn't even know if I was going to Dallas or not till Friday night when Linz offered to take me...  Saw 2brothers....  tried to go to the notebook but they were sold out half an hour b4 the show even started.....  I took Linz out for her bday lunch and we went shopping on Thursday and then Mike took her to Cheesecake factory for dinner...  She went to Ft Worth to celebrate with Lauren...  And they had a ball....  Even though they did go to bed at like 1... Mom got off to France all right...  Finally after like hours of delays becuz of the rain she's finally gone...  Whoo hoo!!!  Anyway more rain is expected this week...  I'm goin either out to lunch with Nat or to a movie with her and to Katy to see how to take care of the dogs and the house since I start doing that Thursday till she gets back from Cali....  W told me all about the wedding last Sunday and boy have I got some blackmail material for some very good friends of mine....  hehehehehe.....  Oh, yea, turns out the X had strep...  Smarty pants went ahead and went to the wedding and had a good time and even got drunk...  Reallllll intelligent move right there....  Anywho I need to finish unpacking so yeah laters and stuff....

      Ok, completely serious post here.....  No boy drama, no music stuff....  Straight up serious shit... And beware it may be a bit disturbing to a few people....  Pretty much an R rating for all the little kiddies, or maybe NC 17....   Anyway this guy I know on GW is going through something huge and majorly traumatic and just plain mind blowing....  He's depressed.  Not just that little bit down or got the blues but out and out suffering from depression so bad you don't wanna get out of bed...  That got me thinking about something I haven't thought about in years...   I guess I sort of choose NOT to think about it because of the awesomeness that is me now...  :0) (no problem with humbleness here, huh? :0) )  Ok, not many people that know me now know that I've been through my own up close and personal bout with depression...  I didn't do the medications, though some thought I should....  I was in high school and nothing seemed to be going my way...  I got in a funk that slowly developed into my not wanting to go out of the house, I had the world's worst time getting out of bed even...  It was like this dark pit that kept sucking me down...  I did nothing but cry it seems for months...  Someone yelled at me, I cried, someone smiled at me, I cried....  It didn't matter what was said, even being looked at wrong I burst into tears....   I had thoughts of suicide....  I was almost obsessed with them...  I was convinced no one loved me, not even my own mother....  If it wasn't for my boys I don't know what I would have done....  I'm convinced if they hadn't been there I wouldn't be alive...  They literally saved my life....  They all took turns calling me and coming by the house...  Taking me out to the beachhouse for long weekends.....  And I didn't have to be nice or polite...  I was actually a huge bitch and they didn't care....  You know the phrase, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger?  I think this applies to me and my relationship with my boys...  If they hadn't have called me and let me be a rude bitch and come around when I had run all my other friends off and not only put up with me but drag me out and force me to have interaction with the world as a whole...  Later on a shrink would say she thought I recovered because I had come to terms with my fathers death (4 years b4), I say its all because of these guys I not only prospered but that I lived period.  They know how I feel cuz I tell em I love em but I don't think they realize how grateful I am to them and will always be.  Depression isn't something to be laughed at or taken lightly.  It can be life threatening, emotionally distraught, and physically debilitating disease....  I'll write about the wedding Sunday tommorrow or the next day, I'm drained now....  Laters.

      Ok, I'm not as nearly freaked out about today as I was last night...   I've had a few friends to 'talk me down' so to speak...  I did crash at like 1030 though which I can't ever recall doing and I got up at like 545 (BEFORE THE SUN CAME UP!!!).  W called about half an hour ago...  He was on his way to the wedding...  He actually invited me to go with him (he said to shock the hell out of 'our' ex but I think he just wanted to talk to me completely alone about something....  That and his girlfriend had a family emergency.).  I told him about the test and he got me to calm down a lot, though I am starting to get a headache, not a good sign...  After the test is over I think I'm coming home and taking a name...  Maybe tonight I'll go see the Terminal with the boys...  Oops time to go wake mom up...  Done...  Anyway when I was talking to W and I told him when I got married he'd be the best man regardless of the groom and he told me the ex had said the same thing...  Kinda funny since he's the ex's best friend and I'm the ex's exgirlfriend....  You're not supposed to be friends with your ex's friends but heck what can I say?  I buck convention.  :0)  Then again I'm also still kinda sorta friends with the ex too so I guess I'm just breaking ALL the rules....  :0)  Actaully I've tried to stay friends with most of my exes, only one or 2 I have no idea where they are (One's in the Navy somewhere and another just dissappeared into thin air - though I think he moved back to Dallas).  Oh, back to the best man thing for a sec, W told me the ex had said the same thing....  For some reason he's been mentioning him alot, either that or I'm just paranoid...  Oh well who knows, it'll all work it self out in the end...   Linz is floating the Comal today with her boyfriend and some of his friends she invited me but I have this test so I can't go...  I think its just the Guad that's being a bitch this weekend...  Least I hope so...  Anyway I'm off to review for a few more minutes and then go take this damn test...  Laters!

      Man, I so would have won that bet....  That is if I'd been betting...  :0)  But I know better...  Or something.  I was right about him...  So I'm not too dissappointed, not like I can afford to get sick anyway...  He called me on his way home this morning and I'm hoping maybe his mom has more luck getting through to him than I have.... In other news, STILL no progress with my car...  Insurance is still trying to get its head out of its ass and help to to get it fixed...   Didn't have lunch with B today, he had a lunch meeting sprung on him and so I wound up having nachos at home... Most of today was spent studying...  And studying some more....  This test in the morning is really starting to freak me out...  It seems like no matter how much I study I'm never gonna be ready....  I drove downtown tonight to try to find U of H Downtown and I wound up driving around for like half an hour...  Came home and mom volunteered just to drop me off in the morning...  I was all about that!  So all I have to worry about is finding the right building...  Geez like I need to freak out any more than I am.... Oh, funny story from last night (not so funny at the time) mom was being all overprotective and stuff last night...  Like she hasn't been in years and years...  Like back when I first started telling her where I was going when I went to see JP play at Fitz's back in like 98....  She called me on my cell at like 11 asking when I'd be home...  Lucky for her I was about to leave anyway and then b4 she hangs up shes like make sure you get someone to walk to your car....  I'm like umm kay sure...  Never had to b4 and didn't plan to start (and succeeded).  I've never felt unsafe at the Firehouse, a plethra of other things but never unsafe....  So I get home at like 1130 and her light's on and I go into say good night and she's out like a light, she'd tried to stay up and wait for me!!!!  What the heck?!?! Yeah I thought it was cute and sweet but rather annoying all at the same time...  I crashed at like 1230 last night and I had the world's hardest time falling asleep...  Tossed and turned and woke up like every hour...  So of course when I get a text message from Meg at 730 I'm awakened out of a deep sleep the best I've had all night long....  Dammit.  So I finally gave up even trying about 1000....  Mom's yelled at me twice today...  Once about money and another time about being unemployed...  Personally I think she just needs to get laid and get off my case....  I've told her b4 I'm looking, but no one seems to be looking for me...  And I am looking I have at least 6 applications out and numerous phone calls made and on Monday I'm going to Highland Village and the shopping center on Silber and I 10....   If worse comes to worst I'll try the Galleria...  But I really don't want to cuz I can't imagine spending more than a few hours there at a time let alone a full day???  Umm, I'd prefer not to thank you very much.....  Anyway its back to studying (fun fun fun I tell ya!!!  Or something....)  Laters!

      ok, 2nd post of the day...  Another quickie...  Went to the Firehouse, the boys tried to surprise me at the Firehouse, and they wound up going back to Kemah without seeing me....  Matt was good, not a big crowd but I kept nodding off for some reason...  I tried caffeine but that didn't work...  So here I am home b4 midnight, sad, huh?  I left a message on B2's voice mail for him to call me b4 he leaves town in the morning but I don't think he will cuz he fears either getting a lecture (which he will anyway) or giving me what he has....  So we'll see how it goes...  B and I are going out to lunch 2morrow...  Study break for me, lunchtime for him...  :0)  Still not sure where...  But most of the day will be spent studying so it has to be quick...  2morrow night I'm probably studying some more...  The test is Saturday at 8 am at the U of H downtown and I have till 1 to finish it, and I can use a 4 function calculator PLUS I've had a tutor twice this week to help me refresh my memory on some stuff so it shouldn't be nearly as bad as it was b4....  Also part of the reason I might have been so tired is that I woke up earlier than usual (Ok, so 830 isnt really early, but it sure seemed like it after a night of tossing and turning...) to watch Jesse James (sigh) on Regis and Kelly....  He was on some other talk show earlier this week too (Leno I think) and he's single again!!!!  :0)  And again my Florence Nightengale complex was activated by him too since he had a little crash in a car and had messed up his leg, his nose, his ribs and he had a black eye...  Poor baby...  Anyway, needless to say I'm in lust again....  Thats about it for now...  Laters!

      Oh, my, God!!!  That stupid, idiotic, moronic fool of a man is just beyond all my comprehension!!!  What is normal when you begin to come down with a highly contagious disease?  Bedrest, and lots of fluids right?  No no not for this idiot...  He has to go and expose himself to other people and vice versa tonight....  I told him he oughta cancel or at least postpone till he felt better but does he listen to me?  Noooo of course not...  I understand people are depending on him but he needs to take it easy for a few days so he doesn't get sicker and he doesn't make people sick...  And it kills me cuz I can't go there and take care of him...  Damn Florence Nightengale response of mine....  Least after tommorrow he's off for a few days and hopefully he'll take good care of himself...  Though knowing him the way I do, he won't...  Stoopid man...  Ok, enough with the raving for now...  I just had to get that out... I'll post more later since I have to go finish getting ready to go see Matt play tonight...  Should be a good time.  Forgot about ol' stoopid head and the TASP on Saturday and just relax for a few hours....  Laters!

      I'm sooooooo bored......  Somebody entertain me dammit!!!   I don't have anything to do for another hour or so when I start to get ready to go out tonight, but for that one hour I have nothing planned, nothing to do and no motivation to even try....  I'm actually bored enough to have calculated the amount of time in the past week or so I've spent shopping...  Almost 15....  Bewteen the Galleria, Highland Village, Steinmart, back to the Galleria and Highland Village (again)...  Thats alot of hours logged in retail, just for shopping!!!  Wednesday, Thursday, AND Friday were all spent just shopping....  And only on ONE of those days did I even buy ANYTHING....   Anyway, so aside from shopping, with Nathan, by myself (when I bought everything) and then with mom I've been at the Park and at home and jobhunting....  No grades yet, the car's not fixed and the insurance chick still doesn't know whats going on....  So I have to call school and insurance again on Monday and try to figure all that out...  Go to Highland Village and up the street to the shops there and apply for jobs on Monday too...  Aye, I'm gonna be busy Monday!!!  I still at some point have to organize the garage like mom wants me to, so that all my stuff doesn't look all cluttered and everything...  Speaking of that Reynosa is driving me NUTS!!!  I can't ever spend so much time with her ever again, she starts the nagging and won't stop!!!  And she's only been back in town like 2 days!!!!  The boys told me they've started reading this thing too whenever they get the chance so quick shout outs to them....  B, Nate, Sean, Tomas, Sup, yall?  :0) Last night I was going to go to Django but I had the worlds worst headache so I didn't...  Bleu and Matt are both playing the same night across town from each otehr next week so I have to decide which to go to....  Cooder Graw's playing at the Firehouse at the end of the month so I gots to go there....  We're going to PF Changs to celebrate Linz's B day tonight since mom'll be in France for the actaul day her youngest turns 21....  I need to call Nat back again, she called earlier and I called her back but she hasn't called me back so I should call her back again....  Phone tag can be sooo much fun....  :0)   ( This bit done around midnight Saturday night....)   I forgot some stuff earlier and some other stuff has happened since....  I crashed in Kemah (as in slept not literally!!!) Tuesday night at B's place, it was like old times just me and my boys....  Guitars, smoke and beer....  And me with a tamborine....  Thats right, ladies and gentlemen my hidden talent, I can play the tamborine!!!!  :0)  It was pure greatness....  We've all been hanging out alot lately, catching up and that sort of thing...  Since mom's been out of town they've seen the new place and hung out here, since we have digital cable...  :0)  Gawd I've missed having them around.... Went to Walgreens earlier and I realized something....  I've gotten really bad about my mutterings of doable and not doable....  People are starting to notice and look at me strangely (not that they didnt b4....)....  Went to Blockbuster and got the Robin Williams on Broadway DVD (pretty funny shit), almost hit on a guy when his girlfriend was standing right there....  Not cool at all...  Mom took us to PF Changs for LInz's Bday...  The food wasn't that great but the atmosphere was nice... After that I came home and W called....  We wound up at Starbucks, pretty much almost closed the joint down...  We haven't hung out in a week or two so it was definately nice...  Though he seemed to be in the mood to extole the virtues of his best friend and ex roomie, my last ex boyfriend...  I don't really know why...  B2 and I talk all the time...  W didn't tell me anything I didn't already know...  Well except for the whole B2 listening talk radio bit....  That I had no clue on...  Made me feel a bit guilty for making him listen to my stuff constantly...  Then I remembered our tastes in music were similar (he even got me into a few bands I didn't know about) and that feeling quickly went away....  Though when I got home I felt kinda sad since I know things will never really be the same, B2 and I dating and all of us hanging out and stuff...  Those were good times, dammit...  But I'm also happier single the majority of the time than when we were together so I think that this is the best way for both of us...  Irregardless of what he says about his break up with Emily or Andrea or whatever her name was that he just broke up with..... Ok, ok, enough with the guy drama....  On to cool stuff...  I was in Harold Powell trying on clothes and Heaven by Los Lonely Boys comes on....  Very cool.  Then this morning I was eating breakfast and the MTV awards show from the other night was on and during Best Onscreen Nominees when they announced Johhny Depp and Orlando Bloom as nominees, they played the instrumental part at the very beginning... Also very cool. Question....  Is there a proper way to hit on a guy at the park?  A protocol if you will....  Cuz I'm kind of at a lose when I want to flirt with a guy, its kinda hard when you're just passing each other by...  Should you stalk them till they stop?  ;0)  Stop when they stop for water, etc?   Flirt in motion?  Throw phone numbers at them?  Any suggestions, any at all?  Email em :sunnychic78@yahoo.com!   Oh speaking of email...  The last few days whenever I've gotten on my Hotmail it has a little link you can click for a little quiz that askes "Are You An Average Guy?"  Cracks me up every time I see it.... Oh, I do have a musician crush again (aside from B2 who I will proably always have a crush on....), most people on GW will probably already know jus tby the way I talk about him, but since I saw him last weekend, I've been a bit ga ga...  Horrible I know...  I have not a shot in hell but its still fun to think about...  :0) Anyway thats about it for now...  Laters!

      First off shout out...  Kevin, just cuz he's dork and he told me he wanted one or else...   (Love ya Pluto!! :0) ) On the the show...  I hate rain...  It seems like its done nothing BUT rain since last night and its expected to continue for the rest of the week...  Lovely...  Mom told me she's definitely coming back Thursday night so I have to go out to Hobby to pick her up at about 8 ish...  Got my Cingular bill today...  123 $'s...  WTF?!?!?   They're saying I went over like 151 minutes and charging me 41 cents a minute...  They're sending me a detailed bill so I can dispute whatever I feel I need to...  All this rain has made me feel really sorta blah...  So I haven't really gotten much done...  Yesterday I went to the grocery store and Barnes and Noble and I went to Cactus for a few while I was over there...  Ordered some books for mom (and I've been driving her car - with her permission)...  Made some calls...  According to the insurance chick its all the fault of the guy in Arkansas so she has to get ahold of him to fix it...  She said it should be completely resolved by Friday...  Good thing I have mom's car to drive, mine drives me nuts after like 5 minutes of driving it...  Went to the park for a short walk, since the rain looked imminent.  I discovered I have 2 bad hanits there...  One I sing out loud along with my CD...  Two I tend to mutter 'doable' or 'not doable' under my breath when passing guys....  Whether they're with friends, by themselves, with girls it doesn't matter, I still say it...  I really need to stop cuz one day someone's gonna call me on it and I'm gonna have to brazen my way out of it or get my ass kicked....  Could turn out good on the other hand, but I'm trying to see all the possible outcomes here....  So if you're from Houston and at Memorial Park and you see a chick in a UT shirt with a CD player muttering under her breath...  Thats me....  :0)  I'm not crazy, just trying to keep myself entertained....  :0)   Anywho today...  Went to Houston Shoe Hospital and got my sandals (they fixed them, yah!!) and then went to Walgreens to pick up some stuff I forgot at the grocery store...  I was gonna go to the Galleria but traffic was hell and I just wasn't in the mood...  Pretty amazing I know...  Me not in the mood to shop...  Its a Kodak moment...  :0)  Sean and the guys just called me from Kemah and we'll probably hang out tonight...  I need to call Natalie too since Scott left last week...  Anywho thats bout it for now...  Laters.

      Quick...  Someone remind me exactly how bad musicians are to date!!!! I fell in love like 5 or 6 times last night...  And some random guy told me he loved me...  I'm like thats nice, dear, now let me by...  Some other dude kept trying to feel me up...  Yeah, I think not, dork...  And some chick kept touching my ass...  No clue what THAT was about...  Oh, yeah did I mention I was at the Firehouse?  This isn't just me rambling about weirdos...  Its me rambling about weirdos at the Firehouse...  :0)  The Lost Trailers played and I fell in love with their music (which I happen to be jamming to now...) and them...  Ryder seems to be the sort of guy I used to date and Stokes was just cool like that...  Manny I didn't get to talk to, and Andrew (I think is his name - the bassist) talked to me for a few and he was an all right guy...  The drummer I never saw...  I got a tshirt and both CDs...  Pretty much spent everything but like 2 dollars last night...  For once I didn't feel retarded dancing since everyone else was too...  Always nice.  :0) Honeybrowne played next and Fred is still a cutie patootie...  Some guy behind me was shouting that he had a nice ass...  The chick in front of me actually slapped it..  Some funny shit there...  Alex...  There are not enough words to describe Alex...  Awesome guitarist, sweetie, cutie pie...  Thats a nice start....  The other two guys were new since the last time I'd seen them (its been a few years)...   Clay got up for a couple of songs and I fell in love yet again...  Damn, that boy's only gotten better looking and sounding...  how could he?  But I heard my song (texas angel) so I'm happy...  A couple of girls beside me were like rating how hot each of the band members were I was trying not to laugh...  Bewteen bands I was outside talking to Becca and 4 kids (looked underage) were hauled outside by the guy I think was the owner and lectured and kicked out, I think they hadn't paid or something....  I wasn't feeling too great so I left and went to house of pies with Sean and the boys...  Came home at like 130 or so and immediately got freaked out...  The TV downstairs was on the home shopping network and I pushed last and it went to GAC, neither channel that I had had the TV on earlier in the day and Mom had been gone since just after lunch so it couldn't have been here...  The alarm wasn't going off or anything so I'm just extremely weirded out...  I wound up crashing at Linz's down the street...  Came back and started my laundry...  I need to shower and stuff so I can go to the Galleria like I DIDN'T do yesterday....  I also need to go to Academy to look for some new running shorts and sports bras....  I need at least one cute outfit and then I'll do the retail job hunt manana and see how that goes...  Thats really all thats going on here...  Laters!

      Ok, I had this really weird ass dream last night...   Somehow the movies King Kong and Jaws meshed in this particular dream...  And Chris Cagle was there...  (I'm sure Lavinia will appriciate that fact - and that he sang Breath In Breath out accapella.)  I don't remember much of the details except Chris Cagle and I were running from King Kong and jumped into a harbor filled with boats...  Enter Jaws...  We hide out in one of the boats and from there....  Just use your imagination....   ;0)  Anyway very strange dream all in all... So yeah, my life...  Lets see went to the Park again yesterday (with Linz this time) and it was hot as ballz...  Came home, finished reading Harry Potter (the 3rd one) and went to see the movie last night with Mom and Linz....   Damn good movie by the way...  Some of the stuff if out of order, and a few major details are missing but there's only so much you can stuff into 2 hours and 19 minutes....  Came home, went and hung out with Sean, who got into town yesterday afternoon...  Came home about 1 or 2 and went to bed...  In an hour or so I'm taking mom to the airport so she can go to Florida...  After that I'm either going to walk at the park or the Galleria....   Tonight is Lost Trailers/Honeybrowne at the Firehouse, so if you're looking for me, you know where to find me!  :0)  I didn't make it to Doug's thing Thursday, I was going to, but I got caught up in something else and I was so unmotivated to go out...  Thats about it for now...  Laters....

      So I put my hand on the doorknob fully intending to go to the park for a lap or 2 and its been thundering and lightening quite a bit the last few hours....  But the moment, the EXACT moment I put my hand on the doorknob, the sky lets loose with torrents of rain!  Sure walking in the rain can be fun, but thunder and lightening too?  Thanks, but no thanks....  I don't wanna die b4 I hit 26!  :0) Anywho...  Today I spent most of my afternoon shopping...  Highland village and River Oaks village to be precise...  Mainly it was trying to gauge what would go well with what and not have to do a shit load of returns (ala Lindsay)...  That and the fact I wasn't in the mood to try anything on....  I'm going to the Galleria 2morrow to do some more looking...  Mainly at Banana and Betsy Johnson I think...  If I see something in a window I won't turn down a trip inside whatever store it is...   Yesterday I also spent shopping and running errands...  I'm fairly certain I went to almost every store on Westheimer between here and Chimney Rock...  I know I didn't but it sure felt like it...   Let's see what else...  I've been really health conscious this last week...  Watching what I eat and shit...  Every night but tonight I've walked for an hour...  Sunday up Allen Parkway with Mom (with a pause to watch the dogs play in the fountain) and every other night at the Park...  Night b4 last I was gonna flirt with this one guy who started flirting with me, but my mom was there and exasperating me with a lecture...  So I didn't get the chance to....  Oh, well I'll live I'm going to see Moreland at the Firehouse tonight so I have to go get ready...  Laters!

      Dayum....&nbsp; You realize if you don't usually use the phrase 'shit hit the fan' how many people think there's something really desperately wrong with you???&nbsp; Its not that bad...&nbsp; And contrary to popular belief I am NOT running away to Corpus, I've had this trip planned since Monday (or Sunday...) BEFORE the stuff that happened yesterday...&nbsp; So this trip will provide an oppurtunity not only to have a kick ass time in Corpus but to get away from the current situation...&nbsp; So yeah, again, get me on my cell if you need me b4 2morrow night...&nbsp; I probably won't get back till like 8 or so...&nbsp; And like the saying goes, if at first you don't succeed, try try again..&nbsp; I probably didn't hear it the 1st time or I can't get to it at that exact moment...&nbsp; No need to leave a voice mail, I haven't been able to check those in weeks....&nbsp; Laters!

      Name - Alison  Gender -&nbsp;Female  Sexy Body Part Is - Your Ass  Special Talents Are - Blow Jobs.  &nbsp;   Gage and every other guy I know should get a kick out of my special talent.....&nbsp; And yes my ass is very nice thank you very much!&nbsp; :0)&nbsp;&nbsp;  I can't tell you the amount of people who have asked if I was ok since Friday...&nbsp; My phone wouldn't quit ringing yesterday...&nbsp; I talked to almost everyone I know...&nbsp; Friends of friends were calling me and telling it was gonna be ok..&nbsp; Now thats some cool shit right there...If any of yall (Sean, Nate, Brody, Be, Dub-ya, Nat, Wade,&nbsp;Tomas, Ra, Zac, Melly, Linz and anyone&nbsp;else I may have forgetten!!!!&nbsp; ) &nbsp;read this, thank you for the love, its much appreciated!&nbsp; I don't like being in limbo like this, but for the moment theres nothing I can do about the situation.&nbsp; I don't like NOT being in control of my life, but in this case there's no help for it.&nbsp; At least not till 2morrow...  Anyway...&nbsp; I went to Cactus today and they don't have the Answers (the CD not to my problems :0) )&nbsp; The only Blue October they had was History for Sale...&nbsp; Which I already have...&nbsp; The same at Borders...&nbsp; So I'll probably just email Justin's dad or beg Gage for a copy...&nbsp; Believe me, at this point I'm not above begging...&nbsp; Or bartering sexual favors, whatever works...&nbsp; :0)  Lets see what else???&nbsp; Oh, I was up to 230 this morning and I slept till almost 1...&nbsp; Haven't done that in a while...&nbsp; Stayed up late talking to Kevin and Gage and playing on GW with Kara and Meg and Kristen.  Also watched State Fair with Sean and part of the Greatest Show On Earth..&nbsp; I've been in a very classic movie stage for a few weeks now..&nbsp; I don't know why, but I'm rolling with it...  I think I may be addicted to bagels.&nbsp; Had one for dinner then again for lunch today...&nbsp; OOO also had a killa pon de huevos (or pon dulce whatever theyre called) from Fiesta...&nbsp; Those are good for a meal, or&nbsp;a snack!&nbsp; :0)&nbsp;  Stu has called me both Friday and last night so I got to heard some Trailers...&nbsp; That was pure awesomeness!!&nbsp; :0)&nbsp; I'm tentatively planning to go to Corpus Thursday to see them myself and drag Becca with me...&nbsp; IF Nat pays me b4 then...&nbsp; I can't go to Billy Bobs Friday much as I'd love to cuz La's coming back into town and its the day Linz leaves for Montana...&nbsp; I'd try to, but La's boyfriend dumped her Friday (a traumatic weekend with the Fritzes I tell ya) and its her 1st break up so she needs me to be around...&nbsp; I'm such a good sister...&nbsp; :0)&nbsp; I may or may not try to drag her to the College Station Trailers show, depends on how she feels...&nbsp; Sunday regardless I'm going to the Sidecar for Bleu and Stoney...&nbsp; Anyway thats about it for now I think...&nbsp; Laters!

          "Sorry, I have a headache, not tonight, dear..."&nbsp; I'm thinking that might be my excuse if I don't go to Cory...&nbsp; IF I don't go...&nbsp; I'm still not sure...&nbsp; I do have a massive migraine brought on by all the stress I've been through today....&nbsp;&nbsp; I've cried at least twice... Not full on sobbing but crying nonetheless...&nbsp; Sean couldn't calm me down, but the more people I talked to, the better I got....&nbsp; So while I still have a bad headache at least I feel more positive about everything thats going on...&nbsp; Let me recap my day here.....&nbsp; Talked to CJ and Gage till the wee hours of the morning and went to bed....&nbsp; Woke up, mom wasn't home so I puttered around and finally finished my laundry....&nbsp; Then I showered and had lunch and mom was back...&nbsp; She asked to see my grades so I brought down the envelope from the Registrar, asssuming it was my grades...&nbsp; It wasn't...&nbsp; It was a letter from Dr Taddie, the dean of academic affairs, saying I'd been academically suspended...&nbsp; Called school, found out it was a boo boo, but that I had not passed one class...&nbsp;&nbsp; Behavior management with Dr Betty.&nbsp; Which keeps me from fulfilling my gradaution requirements, meaning I haven't graduated yet....&nbsp; So then Mom yells at me...&nbsp;Like she went off on the lecture of my life....&nbsp; About my life.&nbsp; Calls me lazy, unmotivated, and pretty much fat...&nbsp; (though who doesn't need to lose a few pounds?)&nbsp; Thats what made me cry...&nbsp; She yelled about me not having a job, also made me cry...&nbsp; So I spend most of the afternoon on the internet trying to figure out where I can take that one damn class...&nbsp; She comes back and yells some more...&nbsp;&nbsp; I tear up but I didn't cry that time...&nbsp; Linz comes over, I run an errand and come back and get lectured some more, but at least its not yelling....&nbsp; Linz and I go upstairs and we're talking and stuff and she reassures me mom'll get over it and quit being so harsh...&nbsp; She leaves and I call Nate...&nbsp; He calms me down no matter what...&nbsp; Talked to Brody next, he offered to come over after work and talk some more...&nbsp; I'm sorta talked out now so I told him no...&nbsp; But we'll all 3 get 2gether b4 Sean leaves Monday.&nbsp; Mom goes to see that 911 movie and I run some other errands (not to self - whole blasting Blue October is good for anger, its NOT good for a headache...), and talk to Melly and Natalie...&nbsp; Nat made a good suggestion, take the class by correspondence instead of going back for one measly class or trying to transfer a class up there....&nbsp; So I'm gonna get on the ball Monday and call the school and ask about that and any other options I may have...&nbsp; Meanwhile I've also tentatively made plans to go to Heather's wedding in all the hoopla...&nbsp; And now here I sit, talking to Gage again and debating about whether or not I really feel like going out...&nbsp;&nbsp; So I'll eat dinner and figure it out...&nbsp; GW is being a P&nbsp;O S so I'm outtie...&nbsp; Laters!

         This comment thingy is new....&nbsp; (at the bottom of each entry...)&nbsp; I wonder if I should keep my tagboard if I have comments too?&nbsp; Hmm I dont know....&nbsp;  Anyway, so I had no luck with the job hunt today...&nbsp; Went over to West U, filled out a few applications, but only 2 places were biring for sure....&nbsp; At least my car seems to be working fine (thusfar at least...).&nbsp; Thank goodness for small favors I suppose...&nbsp;        I worked on the template and updating my links on this thingy...&nbsp; Talked to my GW peeps last night, haven't done a late night chat in forever...&nbsp; Only a few people weren' t there...&nbsp; Kayce, Jason, Brian (though he was there briefly b4 going to bed)...&nbsp; A bunch of new people were there too...&nbsp; Brandon, this dude we know (I say we like we're a cult or something...&nbsp; :0)) from GW and our Yahoo group...&nbsp; Gage, a sweetheart of a guy who seems to get the shaft when it comes to chicks and at times it seems like life in general....&nbsp; And a few others as well....&nbsp; Made things interesting...&nbsp; We had a lot of conversations going on all at the same time, good times...&nbsp; :0)  I was going to go to the Firehouse tonight for Matt Powell, but I didn't make cuz I am one broke ass mo fo...&nbsp; Least till Nat pays me (which she says she will soon...)...&nbsp; I'm still planning to go to Cory at the Racetrack 2morrow...&nbsp; I do have just enough for that....&nbsp; But I might have to bypass Wade/Stoney Saturday...&nbsp; I haven't seen wade in monthes...&nbsp; Though I did see Stoney a month or so ago with Bleu and I'll see him in a bout a week and a half with Bleu at the Sidecar come hell or high water....Talked to Nat, she might not actually punk out on me 2morrow, but I'm not jumping to any conclusions there...  Been working on my laundry most of the night and catching up with mom every spare moment....&nbsp; She went out for drinks with a&nbsp;friend she hadn't seen since who knows when and just got back about an hour ago...&nbsp; And my laundry STILL isn't done...&nbsp; Did I mention I was almost out of clothes?&nbsp; :0)  Still need to make plane reservations for Heather's wedding...&nbsp; Cuz there is no way in hell I'm ever driving back up to Arkansas...&nbsp; Thats a good 2&nbsp;days of driving!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd rather fly and carpool with Melly and/or James...&nbsp;&nbsp;        Sean and I have been doing more writing together than usual, probably since he's leaving on Monday...&nbsp; Gawd what am I gonna do without my Seany???&nbsp; I've gotten so used to having him just a phone call away..&nbsp; Sure he'll be just a phone call away now, but he'll no longer be across town so I can just run over whenever I want to...&nbsp; Darn boy, why can't he be like Brody and move back?&nbsp; His girlfriend is moving back, so I'm thinking he can't be far behind...&nbsp; He only has like 14 hours left till he gets his degree in Economic Studies...&nbsp; So he'll probably move back in December after he graduates....&nbsp; Hopefully....&nbsp; :0) I have a new crush...&nbsp; Not saying who&nbsp;he is or anything, but I think a few people know who he is...&nbsp; And he'll just stay a nice little secret infatuation of mine, cuz nothing will ever come of it...&nbsp; He's completely wrong for me, but hey when has that&nbsp;ever stopped me from being in lust?&nbsp; :0)&nbsp; Alrighty I'm off to fold yet MORE clothes....&nbsp;&nbsp;Geez, its a good thing I didn't buy anything when I was at Buffalo Exchange today...&nbsp; Like I could afford to....&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; :0)&nbsp;I'm also waiting for Stu to call me from the Trailers show at the Tank....&nbsp; I love Stu, he's the world's most terrific guy...&nbsp; He takes pictures (lots) at concerts and calls you from them...&nbsp; You get to live vicariously through him...&nbsp; Its greatness!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok now I'm really gone....

      I'm so sore....  I should have stretched more...  I only did 1 time around the park, though it was faster than usual since Mom went with me....   Yes, mom is back from France and is back to bossing me around as if she hasn't been gone...  She got back yesterday....  I went to the airport and picked her up...  (59 north in 5 oclock traffic, what a good daughter I am!)  And I still have to figure out how I'm getting to Arkansas for Heather's wedding...  Options are still open there...  But back to mom, she and i have done almost nothing but visit since she got back...  She had a great time in france and I did have her talked into goin to New Braunfels this Saturday but she punked out...  The Trailers are playing at the Icehouse so I'd like to go but I can't drive back to Houston at midnight...  Me+dark+driving=no bueno...  So she says she wants to do something with me next weekend....  Hell, thats the Trailers as BB's, so I'm gonna see if I can talk her into that if I can scrounge up some tix...  So we will see...   And yes she has already inquired about the job situation and no she didn't yell...  Though she did a bit when she found out I hadn't passed the TASP/THEA....  Claims I didn't study enough...  WTF!?!?!? So yea I'm still unemployed and I still haven't heard from a lot of the places I've applied or inquired at...  So I'm going to start making calls tommorrow I think....  O, btw, mom was impressed the plants were still living, I told her frankly so was I...  :0)  For those that don't know, I can kill any plant...  I had an aloe vera plant for a few monthes and then it died.... And for those that don't know, aloe is a member of the cactus family...  A plant well known for its hardy nature...  And I killed one...  Yeah, I so don't have a green thumb...  In fact I may have the black thumb of death...  LOL!!!!  :0) So anyway I have to straighten out my money issues cuz I wanna go to the Firehouse for Matt 2morrow and the Racetrack for Cory Friday and Wade and Stoney Saturday...  And if I don't get it all straightened out I won't have to money to do jack shit....  And Nat still hasn't paid me for the weekend of the 4th, though she says shes going to cut me a check soon...  We'll see....  We'll also see if she comes through and goes to the racetrack or if she punks out...   In other news Sean leaves Monday for sure....  No changes in plans allowed...  He has to get back to Cali...  This makes me very sad...  Its been great having him and Nate both in town (nate went home to Cali last week) since I so rarely get to see them...  But I lose not only a really great friend when he leaves but a wonderful cowriter...  I make the poems and he sets em to music and lets me pretend I can play guitar...  Though I can't play a chord to save my life....  :0) Ok ao I'm hungry...  I'm gonna go get some food...  Laters....

      So I was gonna go to see Blue October tonight but Gage (the stinker :P) got sick and couldn't come...  to town...  :D  hehehehe, I crack me up...  Its probably a good thing he couldn't and I didn't go anyway cuz since I ate dinner I feel like I'm gonna be sick...   That and the fact I don't feel comfortable going downtown by myself at night and not knowing anyone...  Like I was telling Gage (i.e. the stinker :D) I have a deeply ingrained sense of wanting to keep my body safe...  :0)  I was thinking about going to the Firehouse to see Randy Rogers (and his cute bassist) play but now I don't think so...  Sean's on his way back from Kemah with his guitar...  :0)  We're gonna do some writing, if we can stop giggling long enough...  :0)  Lala called me from Vegas, she's 'misplaced' her credit card and is trying to find it and called me for the # for the company and mom' s number in France...  I'm supposed to call CJ at some point, but with Lala being at a lose of something so major, I don't want to tie up the phone lines, just in case she tries to call again...  (Sorry, CJ)  Linz called me from the Gristmill wondering about the cover 2night at the Icehouse, so I looked it up and Django and Cory are playing there, 15 $'s general admission...  I was looking over some old poetry today (had to dig through the garage for my big ass binder of stuff)...  I found I have some really corny, lovey dovey type shit and some very embittered sounding stuff...  Kind of an interesting mix there....   For those that are wondering what I've done with the rest of my day...  Slept most of it...  Went to bed at like 1 this morning, woke up at 4, went back to bed at 7 and work up at 11...  Then I took a nap for like 2 hours this afternoon....  The time I've been awake I've spent cleaning...  Fun times, I tell ya!  :0) Also I've gotten a lot of questions about Jacob and I don't know who all I've explained it to but here it is for the millionth (and last) time...  He's a friend of Sean's, who I met at the fireworks display, and went on one (just one) date with to the zoo on Thursday...  We had fun, but I think we'll just be friends...  I talked to him and he agrees...  So we'll hang out, we'll be friends, Ali's still single....  Taa daaa!  :0)  Anywho I think Sean's here so I'm outtie... Laters....

      ok, quickie entry since Linz is on her way to pick me up to go to the park.... Numero uno...  The date went well...  The zoo was a great place for a first date...  It was overcast and it rained while we were there, but otherwise good times...  There were sooo many kids there....  I wasn't expecting that, even though it is summer....  By the way, if you're wondering, some people don't like to have their ass grabbed....  Sure I'm not one of them but I found out he was....  Oh, well...  Thats only one strike against him in the overall picture....  He was funny and we had a good time...  Did the train ride for the first time in years and fed the ducks...  We did miss the Bird Show at 1 and at 3...  Oh, well...   Now the interview...  Not so good...  I was almost late, but did make it on time, only to be told the woman who was to interview me wasn't there yet...  I wait around another 15 minutes for her to show and when she does theres no apology...  So far, I'm not loving this place...  We sit and chat for a few minutes and then she's like thank you for coming in, we'll call you....  (does the line don't call us we'll call you ring any bells?)   So I leave and as I'm driving away I realize she didn't ask if I had any questions about the company and then I realized I didn't so it was probably a good thing...   So the conclusions for today...   Hope the guy calls...  We talked about getting together this weekend, so we'll see how that works out...  The thing at Chico's I'm not sure I want to work out, especially not if everyone's attitude sucks like that woman's...   Tommmorrow morning I start cleaning the house and organizing the garage.....  Fun times.....  :0)  Anyway I have to go change b4 Linz gets here....  Laters!

      WARNING, WARNING, WARNING....  Spiderman 2 is really overrated...  Saw this afternoon and it was cheesy as all heck...  Parts of it were romantically cheesy, some parts of were cheesy horror movie-ish and one part that was even cheesy 50s movie wannabe...  I saw the first one and I liked it well enough....  But this one...  Its like they didn't know what to do...  I saw it with Natalie and we couldn't stop talking about it and giggling.... In other news, we're not going to Corpus this weekend....  I'm gonna try to go to my first Blue October show instead and Linz and Mike wanna go with, so we'll see how that works out...  I think Randy Rogers is playing the same night thought so I'll have to figure that out later....  Cory Morrows at the Race track next week (Lavinia -  you planning on going?)  I may be there with a few friends....  I need to make my plane reservations for Heather's wedding still....  I also need to find out when Mom gets in...  Her last day in France is Tuesday, but I don't know if she's getting in Tuesday night or Wednesday morning... Well the last 3 days I've spent most of my time shopping...  I made a killing at the Galleria yesterday and got a bunch of old movies (musicals, The Muppet Movie, and some others....) and I only paid 30$!!!  Classic!  :0)  I found my 2 favorites at Borders today....  Spent another 30 on those....  (Anchors Aweigh and State Fair, for those that wanted to know...)  Talked to Toyota for the first time in like a week and the car drama continues....   I'm waiting to hear back from Roger in Houston now after he talks to the Toyota in Russellville and the insurance guy in Arkansas....  Will it be fixed b4 mom gets back in town?  Who knows? O, o, o...  My 4th...   In one word, boring.  But hey I like it like that....  I was at Nat's house most of the day looking after the dogs and cleaning and stuff....  Got back to the house about 6 or so (thats when I did that quizzie thing) and the guys came over about 8 (after getting stuck in traffic on the way in from Galveston).  We drank margeritas and beer, ate lots of bbq and then we went down Allen Parkway and watching the fireworks there....  Cute stories there....  One little boy sitting behind us claimed if the fireworks didn't start soon he was leaving....  And a little girl behind us, once the fireworks started, kept squealing and telling everyone how cool, and awesome and pretty the fireworks were....  Dont ya love kids?  I couldn't stop smiling...  I had my boys, cute kids behind me, alcohol in the system and kick ass fireworks to watch...  Thats my kind of holiday....  :0) Oh I saw another guy that could be Bleu's twin when I was at Best Buy the other day...  From the back I thought it was him....  Kinda cool.  On a sad note, I heard Doug's dog got run over by a car on the 4th...  Poor Doug, that dog was his best friend....  Next to Bubba of course....  :0)  Anywho thats about it for now...  Laters!

      Ok, warning.....  I am a teeeeennnssy bit indruxicated....  I was supposed to meet up with the guys...  Or were they coming over here?  I can't remember...  But I made margeritas and I started drinking them....  And I finished the whoooooolllllllleeeeeee thing all by myself....  Probably not the wisest of moves...  Oh, well, its all good....  I thought about going out earlier but no one good is playing anywhere and no one wants to go to the movies, including me, so the guys were gonna come over....   Oh, yeah, thats right.....  :0)  And we were gonna get indruxicated together and watch movies and stuff....  BBut now they are passed out drunk in KEmah with no DD and I sure as hell can't drive to Kemah like this...  So yea we arent gonna get together 2night....  O my Andy ROddick is a hottie....   Sorry, SNL is on and ANdy's the host...  Such a hottie, too bad he and Mandy broke up they were so cute togther.....   Speaking of celeb hotties....  I saw the Notebook yesterday and I have got to say, Ryan Gosling turns out to be anotehr of the MMC hotties....  Boy howdy did he....  Hes everything I like....  Tall, tan, blond, blue eyed, and musically inclined....  *sigh*  Yea so I have a bit of a crush so sue me.... In other news I've been housesitting/dogsitting for Nat since Thursday and she gets back Monday....  Shes paying me 200$ to do this... And I don't mind doing it whether I get paid or not....  Well except for that damn puppy....  She currently has a mastiff puppy that loves to jump and hasn't had its nails trimmed, but she doesn't know if shes gonna keep it or not....  But anyway the jumping and the nails have made for my arms being hellascratched up....  BEar is still the big sweetie pie...  And Tabasco....  Well its amazing how well mannered he is compared to the last time I dogsat for him....  Course last I did he was about 4 monthes old and had a case of the runs....  Didn't make for the greatest weekend there....  But I don't knwo what Nat thinks she can do with 2 mastiffs and a lab if she decides to keep the puppy....   Anywho Linz went to Austin today with some of her friends and we have an invite to Corpus next weekend for Micheals bday...  He turns the big 1!  :0)  Its the day b4 Randy Rogers at the Firehouse and Blue October downtown (still dont know which of those I'm going to....).

         WARNING WARNING ,  this is gonna be one long ass post.....       So since I last wrote... I went to Corpus a week and almost a half ago to see the Lost Trailers play at the Surf Club... (they opened for Creager.) Took lots of pics, if you'd like to see em (for the first time or again) the address is....  urlLink http://photobucket.com/albums/v416/alibob78/  Pics from the wedding coming soon.... And if you don't know who the Lost Trailers are  urlLink http://www.losttrailers.com/ , try it and I bet you'll fall in love!!! So anywho, CORPUS... I visited with my family (her neighbors) then Bec and I went to the Surf Club about 8 ish, just in time for the guys to go on... We get up close to the stage and we're all like jamming out... It was greatness... I made a few DD (Drunk Dials for those that don't know what DD stands for - though in this case I was sober)'s. I am still so totally in lust with Manny and Ryder, both members of the band... Becca and I chilled during the break and I got my Averly Jane Tshirt that I've been wanting... Didn't get a chance to talk to the guys since they had to get to Ft Worth for the show at Billy Bob's the next night... I heard from some friends that rocked.... :0) Becca and I only stayed for part of Creager's set and the we went back to her house... Later that night we went out to the beach for our traditional lookie lookie session... Which turned out to be not so much lookie lookie as avoid the tar.... :0) We went out on the Pier and I think we shocked some fishermen by talking about sex... Whoo hoo, score one for me!!!! We went back to Becca's and watched a movie and went to bed... Woke up late the next day, ate lunch, tried to see my family again, they weren't home, so I came back to Houston...      Most of last week I spent all my free time looking for a job... Almost to the point of obsession but still nothing... Thursday I ran some last minute errands so that I could leave on Friday...     So Friday I fly to Arkansas and Melly meets me at the airport, she's been there an hour or 2 already, since she left early... We go on the longest drive ever to El Dorado and get lost once we get there... Finally find Heather's house just to find no one home... Call her cell, they're all at the rehearsal, and one of her relatives comes over to guide us there... The we get there in time for the end of the big rehearsal dinner... Dez, and Meg and Kristiana and Christina were all there (they were the bridal party they kinda had to be... :0) ). Heather's dad is still convinced I'm JP... Umm, ok, you're known me how many years now?!?!? Chuck was there too as was Craig and Amanda Y. too... Chuck was an usher and Craig was the best man... James was the other usher but he didn't come till Saturday... So anyway Friday night, the girls get together at Meg's hotel room and Dez has hired a stripper... Young, semi buff, bleached blond, almost (wink wink) completely shaved... He was dressed like a cowboy and I thought he looked ok but I wasn't attracted to him in the least... Hence the reason I tried to avoid every lap dance possible (though I did get stuck with 2 or 3 - found out there was no sock in his g string). He seemed like a beginner, he was very awkard at first, movements and attitude wise...( for those who want to see what he looks like...   urlLink http://flickr.com/photos/49503057804@N01/  ).So anyway we're drinking the the stripper is doing his thing... The night goes on and he leaves... Ms Ball and Amanda Y come back up (theyd been visiting downstairs since they didn't want to participate). And we all leave Meg and her mom to go to bed... Amanda goes back to her hotel and Christina goes home, and the rest of us go to Heather's house since we're all staying there... We stay up visiting till almost 2 and go to bed... About 315 am my cell rings (its right by my head since I put the alarm on) and who do I see calling me? Gage. Who I think may have a death wish for daring to call me that late... I slept like crap the rest of the night but he finally explained to me last night that he'd been trying to call Ali Nicole... Anyway we all wake up early and get ready and go to the church... Heather's mom and grandmother both stayed up all night working on the gown and the dresses for the bridal party.... Wow... Whodathunk older ladies could pull all nighters? Not I for sure.....We spend a few hours getting the chapel and stuff ready then another hour or so getting everyone ready... The wedding still happened almost 15 minutes late which I've heard is normal... It was very pretty, the groom cried when the bride walked up, the bride cried too... Zuri and Rashaun showed up late too... The reception went on afterwards, and I served ice cream as I promised I would.. Though I didn't realize the ice cream was the CAKE until I got to the reception... Yeah they were melting since the hall had no AC and had been sitting out during the ceremony... So it all winds down about 4 ish... Heather felt ill so we all went back to her house, me, Melly, Heather, Chuck, Dez, Craig, Katari, and Meg (eventually she showed up). We all changed clothes and Heather started opening presents. We spent most of the early evening doing that and making sure the cards for each gift said who they were from and what they gave... Then we all went out to dinner and to the hotel where Dez/Craig and Heather/Katari were staying... We wound up watching the Whole 10 Yards, which I fell asleep during... Melly and I went back to Heathers about 1 ish... We immediately go to bed. We wake up about 8 or 9 and get ready to go... By 10 we're on the road back to Little Rock. I make my flight with time to spare and the plane was early (WTF!?!?!). I get home about 4 and I do nothing since I'm so tired... I go back out to Hobby at 9 to pick mom up... I almost cried when the rent a cop told me I had to circle the airport since i couldn't just sit there waiting for mom... I was just that tired... We get home and visit (Lauren and Lindsay were both here making cookies). About 11 or so I crash... Hard. I woke up at 11, only because Lauren came in and was playing on the computer... I ran some errands today but I still haven't unpacked...      Oh yea I forgot the great part... I came back yesterday and the 2nd floor AC isn't working, so the repair guy is coming bewteen 11 and 2 tommorrow. So all the fans are going full blast and I'm just glad the 3rd floor unit still works!!!!     Ok I don't think I forgot anything... And I have to go clean the kitchen anyway.... So laters!!!!
