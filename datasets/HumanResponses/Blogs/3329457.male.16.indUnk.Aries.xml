      Now is it just pathetic when all your friends ditch you in the same day? Thought so... Yesterday sucked. I did nothing... All day and all night. I fucking walked around town like a worthless bum, then came home, and did a lot more nothing. I couldn't sleep last night... Too much shit on my mind. So I just laid awake in my bed for hours. I finally got like 5 hours of sleep. About what I got night before last. I can't wait to get outta this fucking town... This place is just depressing. You really do have to be fucked up all the time in this town to keep from being depressed, just about. I'll go without anything for a while and it just fucking sucks. That's the way it's always been. I'm not suffering from withdraws, here, people... I'm pissed off, depressed, and I don't know what all right now. Confused, mostly, like the rest of the world...

      I'm really fuckin' tired... Not mentally, but physically... From today and yesterday. Yesterday I helped work on Adam's 'ped with him all day. Then walked around town doing different things, all for a reason, not just being a bum, and today I actually WORKED on his 'ped, once again, all fucking day. Literally. From the time he got out of school untill a little bit ago. With the exception of walking from his house to mine to get my mower so he could mow his lawn. I'm 'bout done with this shit...  I don't know why I bother writing in this god damn thing. It's a waste of my time. It doesn't help anything, and no one reads it. I don't feel comfortable writing what I'm really feeling 'cause the wrong person may read it, hah, if anyone reads it at all. I'm about to say fuck this place all together and just go ahead and pack up and move to NC whether I like it or not. I would without a doubt if it weren't for a few people, like Kyle, because he's just about the perfect musician friend, and Adam, well, just because he's Adam, and he's the closest thing to a twin I have. Which is probably because we're family. And there's a few other guys, but girls just suck. I'll never understand any of them. And guys tend to get frustrated when they don't understand something, heh, which goes back to Adam's 'ped. That thing is a bitch, but it's running pretty good now... Actually it's not Adam's at all, it WAS Adam's, but he sold it to Opey, but we're fixing it up for him, I keep forgetting that... WHO FUCKING CARES, HUH?

      Wow... Life sucks. Well, I won't say it sucks, because it's not like I'm having the worst time of my life, it's just.... Not like it was. No, wait, it IS like it was, and that's the problem. Nothing around me ever changes. I've been living on the edge of my seat for a while now, waiting for some action to happen. What kinda action, you ask? ANY! And no, I'm not talking about sex. Anywho, it's like the future never comes. GOD I CAN'T WAIT TO GO TO NC!!! Finally some fucking change... If this place still sucks as bad as it does now when I come back, I'm gonna... I don't know what I'll do, but I'm sure I'll be pretty irate with whatever it is... Yesterday was decent. There was a gang of us hanging out in my garage. Drinking, smoking, playing guitar. I'm not naming names 'cause people might start getting pissy about it. ...Ok, I really don't give a fuck now. It was me, Kyle, Chris, Gabe, Lefty, Cat, Robbie, and Ryan. But hardly everyone was there at once. Everyone kept leaving and coming back. Then everybody got really fucked up except me (and Robbie and Ryan, but they left earlier than everyone else) and left. And... it was only like 10. I was mildly disappointed. Fuuuuck it. I think I'm gonna call Kyle up and see if he made it home alright last night and if he wants to jam today...

      I almost said something about not being able to sleep lately, but I'd be lying. The last couple of nights I've slept pretty good, but for about a week straight before that, I couldn't sleep for shit. Kinda makes me wonder if that has anything to do with that being my week of sobriety. Well I gotta go, I'll finish this later.  Anyway, my week of sobriety sucked, in a way, but it was also pretty decent. It went by really slow and was pretty boring, but at least I wasn't fucked up. I back to my old habits now, but not as hardcore. I'm not letting it affect shit I SHOULD be doing. I mean, if I need to go do something, I'm not gonna sit around and get high or drunk instead. I don't know, I need to quit altogether, but it's not all that easy. One of the reasons I'm going to NC to visit my mom is to come clean. Hell, I might even quit smoking cigarettes while I'm down there. My step-dad's a dickhead and won't let my mom buy me cigarettes, so I'll either stock up while I'm here or just quit. I'll probably just quit... I need to get away from everything too. Just a break from my normal life. I think everyone needs that once in a while, and this is my chance, so I'm going to take it.

       Verse I  She's always wanted more, more than she sees, But bases her life, on broken memories, Her past sticks to her, like an annoying little burr, She never looks for the truth, but the truth finds her.   Chorus  Someone please help her remain intact, 'Seems every time I try I make less impact, She's growing apart from me and forgetting me too, I never really got the chance to prove what I could do...   Verse II  Her lack of motivation's left her in a saddened phase, It may last months, it may last years, but years turn into days I heard you out, took your advice when my mind told me to go So here I stand with my hand out to you, you're more useful than you know

      Well... This would be my first...thing, I guess. A lot of people use this to help vent their emotions. Hell, I suppose I'll try it. I have something I've wanted to get off my chest for a long time now...  I'm becoming an 'emotional' person again, which probably doesn't make sense, so let me explain: I was an emotional wreck for the longest time, then, sometime around June/July of last year, I just stopped feeling almost completely. Nothing really made me happy, sad, angry, anything. I was just... here. I think I know why, but I'm not sure (I'm not going to name names).'Person A' (Which I will continue refering to as 'A') I think had something to do with it. I had liked her ('A') for the longest time, over a year. That year that I 'liked' her we became best friends and talked every day, all day, a lot of times. I finally got the balls to ask her out. Well, we went out for like a week and a half at the most, and it all went to hell. I had some kind of break-down that even scared the hell out of me. I hope I never go through that again. I broke down because I was scared to death of losing something I worked so long for. But in the proccess of worry about it, I lost her... I don't think anyone, even her, ever has or ever will understand what she meant/means to me. She's the one and only girl I can honestly say I loved/love. I know that's true because in that time I was "emotionless", she's the only thing that brought me any kind of emotion. For a while, we would go weeks without talking, but not a day went by that she didn't cross my mind at one point or another. I know she's moved on... I'm sure she did long ago... But I can't help but to think to myself every day what it would have been like if I hadn't had that break-down, if we hadn't broke up, if I had another chance...

      Alright, I have nothing to say... I haven't had anything to say for like a week, perhaps more. I've been pretty happy, and I don't write when I'm happy, because it makes me feel like a little girl, and I think I speak for at least a few other guys when I say "I don't like feeling like a little girl.". I've been exposed to some killer music recently though. Slipknot's new one and A Perfect Circle's new one (thanks Kayla). I like 'em both a lot. Best music I've come across in quite a while.  [Safe from pain, truth, and choice, and other poison devils, see, they don't give a fuck about you, like I do] {APC}  Gotta love that song... And I've already run out of shit to say. But I'm being stalked by Kayla and Kat and they both want to molest me, so I'm gonna be retreating to the mountains for a few days... Farewell, you bastards [The Twat Hemselph]

       Hello, my people...   Yes, yes, it's been a while. No reason, really. I'm just sick of my stupid computer. And... I've got the farts right now. They're horrible... But I'll live. Everyone else in the house probably won't, but I will. Eh, lets see... Did a little bit today. Got up at 8:30 to go over to the court house for the shit with my mom, which didn't go as expected. But that's okay, she doesn't have a leg to stand on witht his whole deal. She calls up here and stuff from time to time. As a matter of fact, I talked to her for a good hour not too long ago, then today, she was standing not 4 feet from me, and she didn't say one word. Now that's just shitty... I haven't seen her in a good 8 months, and she doesn't say a word. As much as shit like that doesn't bother me, it actually kinda did... But anyway, we left there, and ate at Cici's. That place is the bomb-diggity... Then we came home. I crashed out for about 2 hours... I was tired as hell. Then Kat, Kayla, and that one Melissa chick stopped by for a bit... Then Luther and I went to New Castle for various shit. He had to get some stuff for his truck and take back a movie, and we had to get concert tickets. YAHOO! X-FEST IN ONE WEEK!!! Came home... And Kat, Ryan, and Christina Raunchy were here... Hung for a bit... Kat left... Chris left... So it was down to me and Ryan. And we just kinda hung out the rest of the day, pretty much. We walked around... Talked a lot... Got Robbie... He walked around and talked with us... Robbie went elsewhere... Ryan and I walked around more... Talked more... Attempted to get Tommy's lazy ass out of his house... Didn't work... Then Ryan and I came back to my house... And I sat next to him... And I... Rubbed his leg... And we decided it was best to go inside... And have sex... On my bed... No, I'm kidding. I wouldn't do that. Katrina would grow insanely jealous. So here I am. I've just kinda been playing guitar and shit of that sort for a while. And... Kayla's just gonna die if I don't write something in here, and I have nothing better to do, so here you are... I think I'm gonna poop... Yes, that's what I'll do... I'll probably write something later, 'cause, uh... I've still got shit to say, but I've got even MORE shit to... well... shit. So, see ya later, and \rock on/

      Hello my people... Today hasn't been that great of a day. I woke up, went to muncie, got pissed off for some stupid reason which I'm not even gonna mention. Then I came home, and was preparing to spend the rest of the day/night alone. I was gonna get drunk and play guitar for the rest of the night... But Adam and Craig came over and I ended up going up to Craig's and hanging out. Then Kayla, Kat, and Ryan walked by and I ended up hanging out with them for a while. Then I came home... Changed guitar strings... Watched TV, just fucked around. I'm tired... Not so much physically, but more so mentally. I've just been in a shitty mood a good part of the day, and done too much thinking for my own good. And now I'm gonna bore whoever reads this... The whole thing about being single gets to me more and more these days. Not that I have a problem with it, don't get me wrong, it's awesome. But... After a while, ya start feeling alone... And I see everyone around me with boyfriends and girlfriends and happy and everything, and it just gets to me. Yeah, I guess I'm a 'likeable' person, but it never goes any further than that. I guess I'm doing something wrong... And I'd like to find out what it is. I don't know, I'm just so tired of being alone... Good day, people. [The -Lonely- Twat Hemselph]

      Kayla... I hate you. You've passed your blogging obsession on to me. No, I don't really hate you, but ya know... Uh... Anyway, this has been a decent day. And don't worry people, I'm not gonna bore you with my daily events this time. Well, I will, but I won't make it as boring as last time.  Yet again, I've been exposed to some great music today. I was never big on Saliva, but their new song, entitled "Survival of the Sickest" is pretty cool. Totally different from their previous material. That, and I happened to see on Strata's singer's AIM profile a link on mtv.com to listen to their entire CD before it's released on Tuesday. So, I did what any Strata fan would do and listened to it. Although I had already heard half of it, I gave it all a good listening. I'd have to say they're probably my favorite new band. As a matter of fact, I think they're the only new band I like. The newest band since them that I liked was SES. Most of you probably don't know who Strata is. They do have a video for a song called "The Panic" now, though, so maybe some of you will discover them. I've been a fan of their's since I saw them along with SES, and Trapt on the SnoCore tour a few months ago. Perhaps you've heard of Downside? Ah, maybe not. That's what they were known as before Strata. But enough about them...  My beloved Keeetty is feeling a bit... down. "Shitty" and "Worthless" are the words she used to describe it, I believe. I think she needs her a man. Them there relationship withdraws are a bitch. I don't get 'em too much anymore though. After a year, I'm getting used to it. Still a bitch though, man... So K@, I feel ya on that note. But I need to shut the fuck up now, so I'll catch y'all on the rebound. Good bye, and good ridance, my fellow fatasses.

      I usually don't do this in the morning, but... I'm bored, and I need something to do. Yesterday was pretty cool. Kayla, Kat, and Tonya came over and made 'Grandpa' food for his birthday. Mashed tators and friiiiied chicken. Oow, and salad. It was all pretty good. It was food, though, it was good to our broke asses... Then... We went on a walk everywhere. Ended up going to the park... That was fun, I suppose. Then Kayla's knee went gay on her and we came back. Then we just kinda laid around in my room. And uh... Kayla kinda crawled into the kitchen wrapped up in my blanket. She looked like she wanted to be left alone... But she looked so sad, I didn't wanna leave her alone... I probably should've though. Oh well... Then it started raining. And we took them all to Kayla's. Came home... Sat around. Watched TV. Did nothing. Went to bed about 12. Couldn't sleep. Then it started storming about 1:15 and I got up and watched and listened to it. Then fell asleep. And that was about it. I was happy it stormed though... I've been waiting on it for a while. Anyway, yeah, yesterday was decent. But I've got a weird feeling about... something... I haven't quite figured it out yet... But I must part. Peace, cunts. [The Twat Hemselph]

      Howdy there, good neighbor... Today has been... Eh, it was decent. Didn't really do too terribly much, but then again, I rarely do. I got up, fucked around, watched some tv, ate, Kayla called, got in the shower, Kayla called again, went to richmond, came back, played video games, talked to Kayla online, Anthony came over, talked to Kayla on the phone again, went up to Craig's and talked to a bunch of people I haven't talked to in forever... Craig, Mike, Sarah, Dustin Stamper, Adam, Amanda, Chris Walters, even Ogle's black ass was up there. And uh... Now here I am... And now that I look back and read this... Kayla, we talk a lot, dude. Not complaining or anything. It's usually pretty entertaining. Besides, you gotsta have somebody to talk to while your 5 year-old is camping, I reckon.  Adam and I talked for a while. Ever since his woman got her license, I really don't see much of him. I saw him for like... 10 minutes about a week ago. And tonight for a while. Aside from that, I haven't talked to him in several weeks. But I guess Randy is wanting jam sometime and throw Adam a 'birthday party', so I guess that's gonna happen some friday. Maybe this one. I say "guess" a lot because I haven't even talked to Randy, I'm just going by what Adam's telling me. So further more, I 'guess' I need to call Randy and get the 4-1-1 on this birthday party shit. And even FURTHER more, I 'guess' I need to get my fat, lazy ass off the computer and go do something constructive. Like... Watch ATHF. Yes, that's what I'll do... Later on, cunts.

      Well now... I'm fuuuucking bored. This has been a gay day. I can almost say it's been a gay week altogether. But mainly the day. I haven't done anything. I sat around, ate, talked on the phone, ate some more, got high, ate again, talked on the phone some more, played video games, drove around with Jeff for a bit, came home, and here I am... AHHH, I need some excitement in my life. It's the same shit every day. Hmm... I need a lover. Yes, that's it... I might actually look for one if I wasn't so lazy. And, ya know, I have someone in mind. Kinda... I don't know, I try not to worry about it. Anywho, Kyle's going to Seattle in about a week, he says. And he said the first person to come up with some money could go with him. It's like $240 though, and there's no way in hell I could come up with that. He's going to do some work for his uncle, so it'd be for money, but still man... $240 is a lot of money to a broke-ass such as myself. It'd be an awesome trip though... I've always wanted to go to Seattle, it rains a lot there. Or so I've heard... I think I'll just stay here and pray for rain. Not really, but hey... Anyway, I'm outta here. {Good day, dildos} [The Twat Hemselph]

      Woah... I haven't wrote in this in about a year. Heh, I bet nobody even bothers reading this anymore. Oh well... That's what I get for being lazy. Life's alright, I reckon. Nothin really exciting has happened since I last wrote. No offense to my people... I consider "exciting" like... A fucking monkey flying out my butthole. Or... Anthony's penis flying out my butthole. Haha, sorry nagger, golden opportunity. But anyway, I've come to the conclusion that if I wrote only when something exciting happened... I really wouldn't be writing much, 'cause monkey's flying out my ass is a rare occasion. Anywho... What's been going on, you ask? No, you didn't ask, you're a fucking computer program, but I'll tell you anyway - Um.... I've just pretty much been hanging out with my peoples. Kayla, Kat, Anthony, Bobby, Jeff, and once in a blue moon, Adam. Chris and Kyle stop by every now and then, as well. OOW! Something exciting (not to you, though, I'm sure): I got a bridge for my guitar, finally. NO MORE CHOP STICK! WAHOO! Well, actually I used a hanger, after sanding down several chop sticks and figuring out it just wasn't going to work. I think I'm gonna be seperated from my girls for a week though... Which isn't exciting at all... I'm not too clear on that whole thing, guess I should probably ask about it. Ah, perhaps it's a good thing. I'm sure they're burnt out on me anyway. I'm not an exciting person at all.  [Turn and pay attention, I lay on the table all my thoughts, Here's my story concerning love, And the feelings that I've fought,  I've tried forgetting everything, My past of the yesteryears, But I'm constantly reminded of times, When your words brought sudden tears.  I'll keep everything inside of me, Let it fall on my own deaf ears, I don't wanna fucking hear myself... It's the fault of the past 2 years.  And it's not I can't make up my mind, I did, and got the cigar, Then you disappeared in haste,  Again, you're so close but too damn far...] {Me}  Oh... Beautiful... But anywho, I'm outta here. See ya later, mother fuckers. [The Twat Hemselph]

      Hmm... Hello... Tonight was interesting... Went to X-Fest. It kicked ass. Linkin Park was awesome as usual. I was kinda disappointed about The Used. But they were still good. Snoop was decent. Less Than Jake was surprisingly good. And KoRn was much better than they were at Ozzfest last year. All in all, it was........ A good concert. Betcha thought I was gonna finish that with "...another brick in the wall." No... I wasn't... But KoRn did! And... I'm dead tired. So is my voice. It's not gonna function properly for a week. And I'm pissed off, and sad. My wife left me. For my brother's, I think. She thinks I like her little sister, but, she's sadly mistaken. I'm getting frustrated with this... Guess there's really nothing I can do. No one believes what I say, so, fuck it. Yeah, hope you enjoyed my monthly blog. Good night. [Taylor]

      This is too hard... I can't keep up doing this, children. It's killing me. Not really... I don't know. Shit's been decent lately... I guess. Um... I need a guitar. I left a guitar over at Wade's a while back, and, well, mom went back to NC yesterday and she took my guitar... That pisses me off. A lot. It wasn't hers at all. Dad bought it for me. That bitch. I hate people. Fuck. Uh... Today was ok. Nothing special. Not gonna explain it. I don't feel like telling anyone about my day. It's pointless. Nobody cares. Um... I need a bigger penis. Later on.
