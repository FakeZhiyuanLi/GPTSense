      The quiet sounds of New Hampshire are sweet music to my ears, which recently echo with mind-numbing traffic that weaves through Connecticut culture.  A state that contains identity in its proximity to more sultry, attractive states and booming, energetic cities can only be left wanting, stranded in a persistent state of pursuit, reaching stretching its highways northeast to southwest, lining the state with as many exit points as possible.    Demonstrate to the youth just how many ways you can leave, find someplace else to call home, someplace else to satisfy needs that this home never knew existed beneath the bored exterior of teenage anger!  Exit to someplace different, or the same, but new to you, to call home, so that someday you can stop leaving, running, pursuing every day and rest in a place that has peace in its own identity.    Someplace you don't speed from on Rt.84 when weekends finally arrive.  Someplace you can dive into head first, eyes open and smiling.  Not a place where, when you attempt to dive, you hit your head on granite.  There is little depth, just more roads, faster, bigger trucks, and genuinely happy people.    Family and friends keep this place with so many ways out a sweet place to stay, with endless hours of laughing and fun, enough to make any place a home, any place warm to come back to.  Open arms, smiling faces, cheap beer, and camp fires convert those screaming exits into after thoughts.    I find myself remembering that I'm leaving, longing to stay in a place so safe, but know that though I can fit in for a few weeks, this isn't where I belong.  I know I'll get the travel itch again, escape to Boston or Nantucket to visit with college friends, return to this home, realize that its not home, just a temporary home base.    I'll hug my family and friends, kiss the new babies and hope they don't do too much growing, and leave again.  Soon, though, I plan to stop leaving people and places; my grandmother would really appreciate my having a true permanent address; she'd like to stop referring to me as her "wandering granddaughter"!

      Hello, hello.  So glad you could join me, take time out of your doubtlessly busy day to take a peek here.  As this site is newly born, I will have myriads of improvements to make, thoughts to jot down, and travel stories to share.  I may have some opinions you'll disagree with, and some that may offend or insult.  Please develop a tougher skin, know that I mean no harm, have no intention of damaging your ego, threatening your lifestyle, or poking at beliefs:)  If you are infuriated, please write me!   It'll be outstanding reading for sure, which I know I'll enjoy.  Really though, I'll most often log what I've been experiencing in my travels south of the US.  If it bores you, please stop reading; I would hate to be the cause of frustration and wasted time staring at a sterile computer screen!

      Large by Salvadoran standards, two story&nbsp;stucco apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool tile floors, and my feet still stick to them.&nbsp; My own bathroom, which I share with creeping bugs, whose little legs I can hear if I listen hard enough.&nbsp; I make a concentrated effort not to listen too hard.&nbsp;   roommates, full of energy, spunk,&nbsp;desire to explore, and a general disdain for all things that creep and crawl.&nbsp; Entertaining at times.&nbsp; I let the moth flutter about the room, my sticky arms, our drying clothes, and&nbsp;Jamie swats the&nbsp;air&nbsp;with a rubber flip-flop.&nbsp; Yes, yes, I think I will love&nbsp;living with these girls, in this place that will be our home come hell or high water!&nbsp;   Wealthy foreigners in the wealthy part of town.&nbsp; A view of the city, the hustle bustle, and a volcano across the valley.&nbsp; I´ll climb it eventually, but with the company of the armed tourist police, whose job it is to protect hikers, campers, travelers.&nbsp; Get used to never being alone, not even to stroll in the&nbsp;evenings, hike in the woods, or shop downtown?&nbsp; Could you do it?&nbsp; Do you think I could?&nbsp; If you know me, you know I will, and I´ll love it&nbsp;because&nbsp;this&nbsp;is what I&nbsp;choose.&nbsp; I´ll cherish my alone time, and embrace the togetherness I´m surrounded&nbsp;with.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I did it, I fell of the veggie boat and into meat-land during my trip home.&nbsp; It started slow, with a slice of honey-turkey from the fridge, then a sausage link.&nbsp; On Nantucket, I spotted the ultimate betrayal of veggie-hood: the homemade hamburger on a hard roll, complete with onions, tomatos and a pickle.&nbsp; I knew then, as I saw the woman at the next table take a whopping , juicy/greasy bite that I was going to finally do it.&nbsp; Yup, I ate the whole burger, bun grease and all.&nbsp; And I have to tell you, it&nbsp;was damn good!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink Today , I dove into a Turkey Club, and old favorite, and was amazed at how much mayo was present.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Why on earth do people need to slab white goop onto bread before they apply white meat and bacon?&nbsp; I'll never understand.&nbsp; Now I'm sleepy, probably a post-turkey effect, which I haven't experienced in years.&nbsp; I'll try to resist napping, so that I can on the plane this evening.&nbsp; We'll see.&nbsp; Adios CT!

      I don't know how to leave here.&nbsp; So&nbsp;I won't.&nbsp; I refuse to say goodbye to people I'll see again soon, at the very latest one year.&nbsp; I haven't gone out for drinks goodbye.&nbsp; I haven't started talking about leaving, let myself even really think about it.&nbsp; I can't.&nbsp; I can't handle the&nbsp;mental and emotional&nbsp;process&nbsp;of leaving a place&nbsp;dear to me again, not again in such a short amount of time.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I've already said goodbye to Portland, and&nbsp;I'll return there this week as a visitor.&nbsp; I can't&nbsp;say goodbye; I'm an emotional wall because&nbsp;I need to be.&nbsp; I can't afford to crumble, not now, not when there is little to no support, none that can be there always.&nbsp; I smile&nbsp;and reassure people that I'm ok, that I will be ok.&nbsp; After all, if I express uncertainty, how will my family be&nbsp;OK as I live a life in a place they can hardly imagine, can only think the worst of?&nbsp; I am solid because I need to be here, that is the role I play.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'll hug people like I usually do as I leave- something I'm rather good at by now- know that they care for me, and&nbsp;I for them.&nbsp; I love the people in my CT life dearly, miss them often, and long for a time when I was happy here, when Roxbury was all I needed, and these people filled me up so that I needed nothing else out of the world other than a Friendly's lunch, and a slow drive home&nbsp;with a&nbsp;beloved friend, the type of friend you could never hug long enough, could never write enough letters too, and wish you had more time to sit on the porch with and let time pass slowly together.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  But really, that time never existed much&nbsp;beyond 10th grade.&nbsp; It existed in a bubble of my life&nbsp;for a&nbsp;month&nbsp;this summer, but I've always had that wandering eye, with feet that constantly itched to run elsewhere, see more, do more, be more than Roxbury seemed to offer.&nbsp; Maybe&nbsp;a&nbsp;time when I'm ready to stop here is yet to come, or maybe I'll always be a visitor in my hometown.&nbsp; Either way, I'll always cherish those lunches,&nbsp;past, present, and future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I wish I could be happy here, spending mornings driving to a nearby job, evenings in local hangouts passing time with family or friends.&nbsp; I wish I could&nbsp;relax every Sunday for dinner with my Aunt, Uncle, cousins.&nbsp; I wish I could have Grandma's homemade&nbsp;"pizzagane" at&nbsp;Easter, warm out&nbsp;of the oven- not&nbsp;thawed from a 6 month sleep in the freezer.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I hate that the beautiful baby cousins&nbsp;I kissed goodbye to today will appear enormous when I see them again.&nbsp; Gabriella won't simply drool on my shoulder and giggle when I tickle her belly during diaper changing rituals.&nbsp; She'll be bigger, fussier, mobile, and teething.&nbsp; She'll do things, have discovered the wonder of her own feet, be crawling, or-gasp!- even walking!&nbsp; She'll be a fun toy for her brother to torment, and not recognize me.&nbsp; Giuseppe, hopefully, will have only a few shy moments as I try not to gawk at how big he is, how much smarter he seems for a 3 1/2 year- old, and how I hate that I miss them both so much, and he'll&nbsp;ask me to play&nbsp;"crash"&nbsp; with the grammar and confidence of a 17 year old.&nbsp; I never thought I'd be a person attached to babies, and I'm not, unless they're around!&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The late evening in Milford, mild bar-hopping with my brother and cousin, reassured my sense of&nbsp;place.&nbsp; I know this isn't the place for me.&nbsp; There are many&nbsp;bars in the world I've felt comfortable in, at home with&nbsp;both&nbsp;the scene and compnay.&nbsp; This wasn't&nbsp;one of them, and I know this isn't my home.&nbsp; Now, the bar scene is not how I judge&nbsp;a place, of course, but it can definitely be one of the many deciding factors.&nbsp; In this case, it is merely reassurance.  &nbsp;  I wish&nbsp;for many things,&nbsp;but I don't wish my life different.&nbsp; Deep down, it feels right.&nbsp; Afterall, I created this monster, and&nbsp;if I don't love it, who will?!&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Finally, our government has made a huge step towards stopping Bush from going too far into the narrow-minded conservative hole.  Gay marriage is alive, and I predict it will thrive!  I hope gay couples around the country continue to show us straight folks messing with marriage how it's really done.  Hurrah!    I have a renewed faith in our system, despite my cynical, cranky disposition regarding government.  This is definitely the first time an act of congress has made me smile, have more than a grim outlook on the future of the US government, and made me proud to be an American- particularly one who backs congress' decision. Today, congress actually represented me, my views, beliefs, hopes for the future of our country!  I'm nobody in particular, but they stood up for my values today.    True representation is possible.  I hope the world notices this act of congress, in addition to the Iraq war.  I will sleep well tonight; big brother is looking after us:)

      A fabulous escape from Connecticut on the island that is a land of plenty.  I can't think of a place I've been to that is more upper-class American than this island of cedar shingles, house-sized yachts, and people freshly dressed from this season's JCrew Magazine.  It was obvious I was not one of  them .  The first night, a man not much older than myself bought 100 shots at $6 a piece for anyone in the bar!  $600 without batting an eye!  Now, when I'm on vacation I surely purchase a couple of rounds for friends, but 100 shots is on the edge of obscene!  But, I suppose, if you've got the money to spend, generosity is nothing but good.  In this case, it was nothing but expensive, delicious liquor.  This place where adult, sophisticated men wear pale pink pants with stiff navy blue blazers, proudly sport gold cufflinks complete with their initials in sligtly raised gold, buy their wives diamond tennis bracelets on a whim, and drink martinis on their private yacht at 10:00 AM is hardly a life I recognize.  Where do these people come from?!  Most of the people who were not part of the young, foreign, struggling, service working crowd were people whose names end in Roman numerals.  John Windsor III.  Charles McDowell IV.    Their wives are named Buffy, hire a 14 year old nanny to play with their kids on the beach while they sun their personal-trainered bodies and read romance novels.  Any mother of four young children I've known does not have time to fine tune a body to magazine-like proportions- she is busy playing, teaching, chasing, wiping noses: mothering.  She did not hire someone to raise her kids while she perfected an even tan.  I realize I may sound bitter, cynical, or resentful.  Maybe I am, but I did try to simply observe, not judge.  However, that is impossible when I get patronizing looks as Steph and I go into a store that has dresses miles out of our price range, but styles that are just right.  As I come home, I tell everyone about the $465 sandals I tried on, and really liked.  Damnit, a smidgen of me is envious.  I liked those shoes, and wish I had an elegant party to wear them too, let alone a fabulous dress to match.  Guilty.  Still, this trip was not about money at all, though I realize Nantucket itself really is.  It was about escaping with my college friends.  And as we partook in all the typical reunion vices- drinking, dancing, smoking, sleeping on the beach, hangover movies- one lasting impression I have is of how very out of place I felt in town.  I was not a local, couldn't even blend in as a tourist.  I was clearly part of the working group, if only a visiting friend.    Despite all of that, when you're with people you've shared your early 20's with, the background fades away and becomes just that.  You really look at one another, sense who they are and how they live, the part they played/play in your life- 4 intense years-and know that you are a better person for knowing them.  I have grown beside them and because of them.  We have seen the best, and ugliest parts of one another.    This weekend, we were dormmates once again.  We ate greasycheesy food at 2AM.   A friend cocktailed at the local bar, getting us a deal on drinks.  I shared a room with my roommate and her boyfriend.  We napped in the middle of the day.  Really, nothing has changed except our geography, and location is merely a detail.

      I feel as if time has stopped, as though I'm stuck in humid air that doesn't change, nor allows it's surroundings to move.  The thick, day old pea soup of my life. I stick to everything, and the tiny gnats that I'm now remembering too clearly get stuck in the tight corners of my eyes.  They force me inside at the best part of the day: when the sun goes down, the dog is calm, and the stars begin to dance.  I'm aching to dance, fly, spin, scream, cry, shout, feel alive!  I can't breath, but that's all there is to do here.  I'm resorting to old pastimes, napping, ingesting too much sitcom television.  I can hardly stop pacing in frustration enough to read, write, think about anything outside this small world.  People go to sleep at 9 PM after a few hours at the local pub that has five lonely booths, and two lonelier rugged pool tables.    I'm too critical because I don't have a life here.  People do and they love it.  Work, play, friends and family, entertainment of some sort.  Maybe someday I could, but days like this it is unimaginable.  How do people, single young people particularly, stay satisfied?  I envy their peace, clarity, and ability to make more out of a place than what is obvious to visitors.    I was once an insider, and I ran vowing never to return.  I'm now a visitor, wonder why I would ever return for such a long period of time.  The romance of coming home has faded into reality, and it is just like I remember.  The people continue to make me smile, and I wish I could take them all with me.

      Today it rained so hard, the house glowed.  Little drops fell like the dead and sprang up with equal speed from the newly painted grey deck, the old-but-sturdy shingled roof, and the low-maintenance white vinyl siding.  Home, sheltering my family that seems to be held together by love, denial, and good cooking.  The rain provides me a thunderous quiet, making this house that is anything but large and hollow, seem precisely that because I feel I cannot leave.  The rain is a locked door, a heavy curtain blocking the outside.  Even the dopey dog hides, seeks companionship with the disgruntled horses who try to step on him as the thunder shakes away any thoughts of venturing out.  We are forced to stay inside, look inside, which is always scarier than looking out.    I often would rather run, sprint through world and swallow it whole, examine what I haven't digested at a later date, any later date.  This year, I have been examining my innards with a strong, clean microscope.  Though surprising at times, I like my findings.  Hurrah!  I have all the necessary parts!  But alas, I'm not assembled like most people I know, which makes both me and my path a bit peculiar to onlookers.  Most of the active participants realize my assembly quirks by now, I hope!  Yesterday I attend two annual events: the family picnic and the town fireworks.  Both events are full of people who make me smile, good jokes, food, lots of drinks, and people I hardly recognize.  I go down memory lane with some, talk about current events with others, and recap my life and future plans in 30 seconds with most.  I'm now a pro.  I can wrap up everything I've been through in the four years since I've seen these people in a tidy little paragraph.  I can whip out the speech in a moment's notice, when the questions are asked.    To them, my life appears to be a cliche, or a tunnel I've recently poked my head out of to say "hello" to them from.  Maybe they're right.  Before I came home, I was so incredibly tired of my life and drama that I didn't think I could discuss it with a soul.  I wanted to forget it all for a few weeks and rest, get emotionally recharged for when I head out again, so I'm able to fight the loneliness of the world with action and vigor.  Who knew that coming home would help me put my experiences into a display box to examine at a distance, as if they're someone else's'.  Following the fireworks was a small gathering at a friends house.  This means six of us drinking beer in the back of pickup, by the cloud-covered moonlight in front of a friends' parents house- where he is unhappily living until he marries in 3 weeks.  Interesting, fun.  Memory lane, but better.  I enjoy hanging out with old friends not out of nostalgia, as had been the case in past years.  I can pay attention to people and enjoy their company for what it is now, not what it was.  I cherish who they are, what they have to say, their courage.  Thrilled to realize this, I wonder if maybe this is a place I can someday call home again, because I know better than to think home is simply a place.    The rain has stopped, but the lightening continues.  Things are clearing up, and summer is only a short storm and an starry night away.  Maybe I'm growing up after all.

      Things were weird, just strange.  Leaving is such a bazaar act, taking months to plan it, weeks to solidify and let go of relationships, friendships, the slow changing process.  Sometimes I want it to be quick and easy, pain-free, like a five year old pulling off a sticky band aid.   I carry the weight of this city, my place here, my leaving, my relationships, on my sturdy legs, leaving my ankles throbbing as I lay in bed, alone.  They are swollen with experience, lessons learned, and early morning runs up Mt. Tabor, which might as well be the highest mountain in the world at 6AM.   The process is so much of an emotional process that I am left exhausted at the end of the day, unable to place where my energy has gone, realize that I've been spreading it across Portland, blanketing the city in as much of me as I can let go of so that it'll remember me when I want to come back.  So that I won't be a foreigner here, that I'll be able to call it home if I choose it again.  So that I'll have friends to come back to, a neighborhood where I was once a regular.   I dance in a club too late on a Wednesday, spin, glide, laugh, follow, trip, smile.  I step and twirl and fly through the early hours of the morning, leaving a piece of me on the floor, while the remnants slowly drive my tired bones home, I collapse into bed with throbbing feet, wake up too soon smelling like men, sweat, tasting the sweet salt of my life.   I drink thick beer in smoky bars with supportive friends.  We shoot darts in crooked waves towards the bull’s eye.  We shoot pool and smile while we question our skill vs. luck.  Pitchers are finished, stroll happily home, and as I doze off to sleep, I suck in the cool night air that seeps into my window and I howl at the moon.   I sit on my front porch smoking cigarettes, people watching, chatting, and saying nothing with my wise-for-her-years friend.  The hours pass slowly, the evening is timeless until her husband calls, offers to pick her up.  We delight in the next hour as dusk cloaks us with a light mist.  Then I’m left alone with the evening, and me and the night have endless romantic hours as we stroll through time, my neighborhood and go home together and fall asleep with our bodies luxuriously tangled.   I sleep and absorb energy from the full moon that lights up my room in the dark.  And the days keep coming, demanding more and more of me, and I open up and pour my heart again onto the streets, into the people in silent goodbyes.  I dive into this city, let it swallow me whole.  When we're through swimming through the spring together, it'll spit me back out, and I'll land alone in a foreign country, to start the home-making process again.  Friendless, language-less, eyes wide open, vulnerable and searching for where I may belong in a place I may not belong at all.   My goodbye tears are sweet, decadent streams that I would not trade for anything.  I created these rivers of emotion, and I'll ride the rapids and know they could never dry up for good.

      Hola amigos. It´s me here, trying to focus on work this beautiful Sunday afternoon. Of course I¨m at work, getting ready for the week, so that I can leave school before 5 PM this week. If I¨m well planned, my life will be happier, I¨m sure.  However, I am unable to focus. Yesterday was relaxing, yet productive. I finally took a run in this seemingly exercise-free city. Of course, I was subject to a few less-than-welcome comments as I trotted by men lounging on sidewalks, but all in all, it was a pleasant experience. I¨ll need to go very early in the morning, or late in the evenings to avoid mind numbing mid-day heat. I also may elect to walk up the mountain to school as a form of exercise; this could be good for both my rear end, and my attitude with the kids. I¨m a much calmer teacher is if expelled some energy early in the morning!  Last night was Daniella, one of my roommates, birthday. So true to form, we went out to celebrate. Early in the afternoon, the new gaggle of friends surprised her with a delicious Salvadoran caramel cake and small gifts. Then, after the older crowd went home, we lounged, dressed up, and hit the town. A new friend here, Marco, and a friend of his were our local male companions (something helpful for gringas new to a Latin country), showing us several good bars and hangouts, and two great places to dance.  At our first bar, Zanzibar (which is a slang term for El Salvador), we were caught in the pouring rain and delicious thunder storms. As many bars are outdoors, the umbrellas swayed, women ducked, men protected drinks from ending up on unsuspecting laps, and everyone laughed and shrieked as we ran as quickly as women can in heels to the new, underground section of the bar. Very cool, very cool.  Next, we went to a club in which Jamie and I were very nervous about seeing one of our students. Man, some of those seniors look old! So, after a few free drinks thanks to ladies night, we changed locations. The last bar was the best, with casual dancing, and an older crowd where I did not fear student interference. Ah. So, we dance. We spun, bumped into struggling cocktail waiters, laughed, drank, and had a nice time. It was not a rave of a birthday for Daniella, but a fun night just the same. She managed to get a phone number of the bar manager, so she considers the night a success. A potential friend, or just one more person to know in the large unknown city is always a good thing.  This morning, I woke up at 11. Hurrah! After two episodes of Sex and the City, leaving us longing for someone special to kiss, Daniella and I went to our favorite sandwich place, Lido. Their turkey sandwich kicks the butt of any sandwich I´ve had in the states, including Bowers Bakery in Portland, and the Washington market turkey-on-a-hard-roll. Yup, believe it. Complete with French baguettes, two types of cheese, a Jack Daniels dressing, and smoked turkey breast, I am well fed, have leftovers to snack on if necessary, and am ready to work.  Now I¨m off. Hasta Luego.

      I thought teaching was supposed to get easier the more years you tack onto your resume. How wrong I am. Today I was handed the most demanding schedule of classes I´ve had yet, large portions of literature text books from the 80´s (which were sucky for kids even when they were new), and a book titled  Literature from England, Classics for Christians .     In the large, intimidating grammer book, there are complete passages from the bible, so that we Christianity can be pushed as we discuss sentence structure.  Ah! Needless to say, I will be using those book sparingly at best. Am I really in a place where Harry Potter is banned, and there are no class sets of novels? Yes, yes I am.  The upside- I still like it here. People are fabulously accommodating- to both my novel requests and my poor, tired Spanish. I´ll be loaded with planning, but I anticipate it getting easier- glad I traveled when I could. Though, you know me; I´ll make time for myself, my pleasures outside of students (whom I do genuinely love) if it kills me!  Soon however, I will need some alone time- there has been none so far. I feel a creative, solitary urge coming on. Hopefully it´ll soon be satisfied.  Kids come on Thursday- Ah!

      My compadres nap soundly in our quiet, air conditioned, dumpy hotel.  For $25 per night, we were thrilled to have both TV and AC- that is nothing short of a miracle for central america.  I find solace in recapping this trip for you.  I am afraid to report, Montezuma has caught us all, in varying intensity.  Danilla has it the worst, while Jamie and I have only occasional sprints to the nearest bathroom.  After this day of lying around the beach, swimming in very warm, clear blue water, taking shade-breaks, sipping/guzzling fresh piña juice, and munching on homemade coconut bread bought off of a local young kid- who should be in school- we feel much better, well rested, and rehydrated.  Tonight, we´ll walk the streets of this poor carribean town in search of stomach safe dinner, cool piña coladas, and take a soothing, evening swim as the sun sets.  Tomorrow, we return to San Salvador viaa 10 hour bus ride.  Adios!

      A week off before we begin school. The city is on vacation this week. Ain´t that great?! I wish cities in the states would choose one week a year to close everything and enjoy their surroundings!  Me and the girls decide to take a little trip with all of our free time. So, at 5AM today, we were on a fabulous, air conditioned bus to Copan: a location of massive Mayan ruins in Honduras, on the border of Guatemala.  Here, now in this air-conditioned internet cafe, I stink. My arms were sweating today. My calves were dripping. I can´t drink enough water to satiate my desperately dry throat, and cool my melting body. Clothes are sticking everywhere, to every part of my body, leaving my underwear in a sticky, twisted knot near my waist, stuck to a leg, too low on my stomach. I have never wanted to strip in public more than I did today!  The ruins, however, are nothing short of amazing. How those little Mayans, thousands of years ago, created such architecturally interesting, intricate, and ornate work baffles my mind. It makes me want to get involved in some pottery classes. I´ll download pictures when I get back home in San Salvador.  Small, one-woman tienda´s , crooked stone streets, men on horseback, local commodores with homemade tortillas, fresh frijoles, and satisfyingly milky horchata. The town of Copan is traditionally Central Cmerican, more so than the big cities which are mostly striving to be the US, which is both bad and good. They have a long way to go, but all those damn chains have made it here- arrgh!  Tomorrow, we take a bus to Tela, on the Caribbean side of Honduras, for a few days on a beautiful beach. When I begin to melt, I´ll seek solace in the cool, blue waters of the coast. Right now, we´re off to shower, and find us a couple of cervezas.  Hasta Luego
