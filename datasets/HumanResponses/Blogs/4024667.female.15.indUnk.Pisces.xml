      I can't believe myself, today. I find myself milling around the house, procrastinating about practicing SAT's, reading "Scarlet Letter", reading "1984", learning words, wishing to GOODNESS that Justin would just call me or talk to me somehow, where I can say "I love you" and he would reply with the same. I know that I am wasting this awesomely beautiful day, the intensity of the sky won't last forever, the green grass, leaves, trees, bushes, flowers will be gone before we can comprehend it. I just want confirmation that, yes, I am thinking of you, yes, I do miss you like crazy, because I certainly am going insane with missing him. I can't contact him! I don't know the number, I don't know when he's online, if he is online for that matter, I can't believe I am so depressed on such a beautiful day! It is perfect outside and I just turned down a ride to the pool. I am so pathetic! I can't believe my lethargy. I just want, so badly it literally hurts to think about it, to talk to him. So weak. Weak, weak, weak. :( It sucks, and I can wait around all day online or sit by the phone and I know he won't call, but there's always that LITTLE CHANCE that MAYBE he will think "hey, I should call Becca" or "hey, I should IM her" or something crazy and totally out of the ordinary  . Why why WHY can't I get him out of my head?! 

I am wasting my summer and my sister isn't helping. She is desperate to go shopping for back-to-school stuff. I AM NOT READY, I SAY! I am not ready to buy new things for a school year that I am not ready to start! I can't stand thinking about it right now, and I know it is because I have so much I haven't gotten done yet, that I will get done! I need to get it done!

I did well in my tennis match today, I beat this kid (Robbie) 10-2 in a 10 game pro-set. It was pretty cool, considering my serve was very nice to me :) Thank you, serve! That was a good day we had there, wasn't it? There was some brutal rudeness in the other matches, though. I can't believe what this 15-year old, 4' 9", red-haired kid was saying to our team! He was so smitten with himself and his mother was egging him on. She was practically bragging that he is in anger management, which is not something I would want other mothers or kids to know, and I was thinking "what a horrible excuse," and many more horrible things I can think to write, very derogatory and crude and, well, bad. But I will refrain from doing so, I do not need to be bigotted. (yeah, you go look up bigotted, good word to know)

I need to go run, or do something, or play something, or HIT something I am so contained within my brain that I can't think anymore! I need less distraction and more motivation, more inspiration! Darn it!

I am ranting and raving, prattling on and on. Just don't think anything of this entry, because it is the first time I have had this many negative thoughts in a very long time. I wish I could be enjoying the time I have left, not willing it away just so I can see (or at least TALK to) Justin.

AHH! At least I get to go to Ellen's for the night, and talk about things to get my mind off of whatever. Eep. Help me, help me! I'm sinking!

I fling myself in desperation
wanting relief of stressful thinking,
remembering when my biggest concern
was just to breathe in and out again.
You catch my as my seemingly sturdy walls
come crumbling down around my feet,
my fingers flailing for just one piece
to remember how things were.
Carefully, one by one
you build me right back up again
standing on my own two feet
with your body sharing the precious heat
to warm my emptied soul,
and when I gaze up
beyond my teary eyelashes
always, your knowing smile,
"everything can be all right now"
arms linked to compress trembling lips
sweetest words coaxed from a practiced tongue.

      Today was the final day of swim practice for the Braddock Heights' summer swim team! I must say, it has gotten me into terrific shape! I feel great! I love swimming, although some practices were very intense... Anyway, I never seemed to get bored of getting up in the morning, walking up and back from the pool, and swimming countless laps in an over-sized pool. The ending of a swim season that we never officially participated in-- a total of zero meets! Who honestly wants to get up at 5:30 AM to go swim in a cold pool until 12:00 PM? Not my favorite thing to do... especially on a Saturday morning! So this ending was an interesting one, considering we were never really official swimmers of the league.

We got home from swim practice, and found that our maid was cleaning the house. She not only took 5 hours, but stranded myself, Erica and Sue on the porch for 4 of the 5 hours, when all we wanted to do was make some pretzels and eat some lunch! We had no food until 3:00. That's a long time to wait for lunch. I was so ravenous I wasn't thinking very clearly... I fear I have been very testy lately, what's going on with that? Hmm... I should play more tennis. That would probably cure something!

We ended up making our pretzels, they kick butt. I had a pretty uninteresting day other than that. I am going to play my tennis match tomorrow in Leisburg. Fun times, I hope! And I hope I play better than I did yesterday! Whee! I'll have to pack a lunch, or at least some tid-bits of food. 

I am very excited, though, to be going over to Ellen's for a get together with our closest friends!! This will be wonderful considering I haven't yet seen Connie or Ari as of yet this summer!

I went on a lone trip to the pool today, and besides reading, just dwelled on the kids and their parents and how they interact. Everything is so happy, blissful and innocent, not to mention the love that just envelopes you! It is so very sweet to feel that, and it brought back buckets of memories from the pool with my dad. For example, until we were too old to do so, my dad would throw us out of the water from his shoulders, hands and sometimes head! It was so much fun! We would try doing flips, and back dives, and all sorts of tricks. Helicopter was my favorite. We would race from side to side in the pool, and dad would always win. Mom wasn't much of a pool person, but once, after discovering that she walked/jogged with her friend Jan, I decided that I wanted to try it. I sprinted off without her, and I think she came after me, but I knew to stop at the stopsign. I couldn't cross the street alone at that point. My parents were furious and picked me up in the car... I was terrified, but pleased with myself for my speed at getting up there. I've loved running ever since.

I believe that being a child of that age is the most wonderful thing in the world. I wish I could be a little, little kid again. I remember how new everything was and how big everything and everyone was... oh, the wonderful kid years!

I feel like I'm growing up way too fast. I want to be a kid forever and ever. I love being a kid! Kids rule!

I also realized today that religion and faith is beautiful when people have really found it. I have found that the people who really believe have let it come to them... and that is exactly the answer I've been waiting for when it comes to believing in something that concrete. :) When it happens, I will let it.

I am eager for tomorrow. I need some sleep, though. Tomorrow I will be getting up way earlier than I have in a while! So, goodnight. I wish I could speak with Justin, just to say "goodnight". I wish he would tell me "goodnight". :) Goodnight, moon!

      What a day! I get home from a grueling swim practice to my desire to do something nice for my family by using oil on the furniture out on the terrace. I told my sister I was going to do it, and of course, she follows, even though she said to me that she didn't want to do it. I had my hands full of a phone, paint brush, paint-stirrer, can of paint, Ginger Ale and sand paper. In walking my decrepit dog down the driveway, my sister got miffed that Zoe (dog) couldn't make it. So she took off her extra anger and frustration on me. I don't know why, but I snapped and said, half yelling, "I would have gotten you a paintbrush but I had too much crap in my hands!" Her weak rebuttal was "Fine!" So I am in a huff now, finding her stupid paint brush, and when we find it, it is crusty and destroyed, so I tell her to wash it off or soak it in Coke (powerful stuff) and she does a slipshod trial. Urg! I was furious by then. All I'd wanted to do was oil the table! So I do half of the table, not any of the chairs or benches, and she comes out and makes me feel so bad and angry that I just give up and give her the paintbrush and she finishes it. The funny thing was she acted like it was a competition for attention and doing nice things. At that comment, I was done. I couldn't tolerate her today. I really can't stand that much together-time with her. She is so obnoxious! And of course, tomorrow I will feel bad about saying all of this, and like her as much as ever. She is a good person, just very competative about our parents' liking. It is so annoying! 

Sue got here and it was my extreme desire (need, more so) to make pretzels today. We did not have flour or kosher salt. URG! So now I am just frustrated, tired, sore and huffy. Our pretzels sucked, we have no food in the house, and many other conversation bits that consisted mostly of complaints reverberated through the kitchen for about an hour. Insane, and relieving.

Later on, I called Ellen to say I couldn't give her a ride home. I fell asleep in 3 minutes, not even realizing it, and missed Ellen's call. Silly me. I was so pooped that I couldn't really wake up for the remainder of the day. I was groggy when going to the antique store, had to quickly abort AOL and left Alex before he could finish what he was saying (I am sorry, again, I did not mean to be rude.)

At tennis, I played horribly. It sucked very much. I learned that our tennis match this Saturday is in Leisburg (way to give us a great heads-up!) approximately 45 minutes away. That's a long way for a silly tennis match that we can't even practice for because our "coach" doesn't show up. (This is a lot of complaints isn't it? Not even satire is being used! Just plain complaining... Oh well. I won't be using too much more lineage for this) Anyway, so I have to figure out who I will be riding with, if I will be playing, and "all that jazz!"

As of now, I am sleepy and sweaty, a deadly combination. I must ask myself, half heartedly, "Do I really have enough strength to turn on the shower, wash my hair, dry off, dry my hair and THEN go to sleep? I really just want to sleep now... But then I will feel grimy in the morning. But I will go to swim in the morning! All the sweat goes away!" etc. My debating brain cells. Interesting, eh?

Some good news, though, I talked to Greg today. We caught up about little brothers stabbing themselves with idiot-proof carving tools, girlfriends, boyfriends, online journals. :) It was nice to talk to him, but we were both tired. Very tired. And hungry. Hm. I am thinking that he and Allison are good for each other. More on this later. 

Oh! The bit more good news! Justin got back from his cruise today (maybe not so great for him) and I got to talk to him for all of 4 minutes online!!! :-D That made me very euphoric for all of 4 minutes, then a super-crash...  he left without me being able to bid him farewell... it's horrible. I can't understand why I have horrible timing. Ah! So now I probably won't converse with him for a long time. Probably not until he returns. AHH! 10 days! I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG without talking to him...

I need some sleep, and also am desperate to get over my concieted nature these days. I am sorry for ranting and raving, but that is the purpose of this, right?

      Today was a good day, for the most part. Erica and I went to swim practice, swimmed our butts off with the 5 other people that decided to come, then walked home. Soon after we prepared a lunch and took it up to the pool. I was starved, but Erica didn't eat (weird?) so her sandwich was inedible by the time she was hungry for it. Silly girl. We talked to Chirs Goulard, who is glad his dad is out of the hospital after a huge cuadrupal-bypass surgery... ::gape:: he's feeling fine, though, so that's good. He's a funny kid, but this random girl started a conversation with him for 2 seconds, moved all of her stuff, uninvited, to our table while we were eating and feasted on our food without asking. This, not even knowing her name, was very obnoxious. She did not get the hint, and continually flirted and hit Chris, which was an odd and annoying spectacle. I wanted to be rid of her, so I got in the pool, and by that time one of Erica's little slutty classmates had joined our table. I didn't want to hear or see any more, so we left. Oi.

Later on, Erica had left, I went running, further damage to my feet, and blisters that are beginning to bleed. Ew, and ow at the same time. It was a good run, though. I really enjoy running, minus the dogs. (we have some vicious dogs on the street.)

This evening, I made dinner for the family, which was very good. A wine sauce over grilled chicken and asparagus. I was pleased, too bad I managed to make Dad mad in the meantime. It was a good dinner, though, and I hope it made up for some of it! I hope I can make more recipies, because it was a great way to get my feet wet. I am going to be a great cook someday!

I am not feeling very social, now, and am not interested in talking to anyone. I keep having these vivid dreams that confuse me. I am generally running away from something. ::sigh:: oh well, I have nothing interesting to report. I ought to stain the table tomorrow, clean up my room and read more of my book. I plan to finish "The Scarlet Letter" before Justin returns. (Justin has been gone a week, today, or at least since I've been able to see/talk to him.) I am very eager to talk with him. 

Until tomorrow, maybe with news! (for a change)

      I wake up this morning to rain beating down my window, and in rolling over and seeing it is merely 8:20, and raining, and I have no desire to walk the 1/3 mile up to the pool for swim team, I roll back over and dream some more. Falling back and forth through sleeping and dreaming, it was nice. I haven't been able to do that in a while!

To compensate for no activity in the morning, I ran with my iPod around 4:30 until 5:20. It was nice until the blisters came... ::sigh:: they still hurt, and itch.

I must say, I have a complaint to make to pop-stars of today. Today's bashing is directed to Britney Spears. I was mindlessly searching through channels past the weather channel when it was looking stormy today, and reached MTV. I saw "making the video" as the show, but it certainly was NOT making the video! I was trying to relax myself before doing some yoga, mind you. I sit down to stretch, and Britney comes out on stage in a robe, singing this very sexual song, too sexual for the 75% of teen-and-younger (average age, I believe, is 11) watching them. So she strips off her robe, singing about "the intensity of the touch of her hand..." blah blah, whatever, and she isn't wearing anything but the sparkly strip-suit with glitters all over it. I was so embarassed, watching alone in my house, mind you, that my face turned bright red, but for writings' sake, I figured I may as well figure out if I could write more bashing. The camera continually goes back and forth from her to these naked (just boxers) men that are girating over beds, TV screens and chairs, and for a lack of a better word, have obvious boners. There are screens with beds behind them and red lights and people are having SEX behind them! Britney is in this little cup-chair teaching the kids about sex, how to have sex, what sex is, what sounds to make! How much money would you bet that those little kids go home and write in their journal that they saw Britney do it, so they want to as well. The music is all lip-synched, too sexy and suggestive for such an impressionable audience, and my GOD WHY WERE THEY DOING THAT ON STAGE?! It was horrific! I couldn't take any more after that. I am sure it could go nowhere but get worse.... it was disgusting. I am horrified at America's pop-culture. You wonder why 11 year olds are watching their calorie intake? You wonder why teens starve and binge themselves to stay thin and "sexy"? You wonder why the percent of minors (under 18 years of age) are getting breast implants and having procedures done to their bodies to "fix" themselves?! You wonder why America is so screwed up in the head that we can't even be happy with ourselves?!?! I cannot think of how bad things will be when my children are growing up, barely accepting themselves, glued to a TV image of the woman/man they want to become that is perfect, airbrushed, nude, and far too sexual for their genera. It is disgusting, appaling, absolutely wrong! I can't believe what people with so much money they could pay for a cure for AIDS or give counsel to every person they messed up. I think it is a sick world. I am ashamed of our world. We are disgusting, humans.

I wish I could fix things for newer generations, telling them "be happy with yourself, there isn't anything you can give back for a new part" instead of broadcasting sex-filled imagry with perfect girls, advertising Botox and lyposuction and plastic surgery... I don't know... That's enough of that.

So, I have not much more to say, and Mom is on call, so I will find something else to talk about. 

Hasta luego.

      "Come away with me to my fairy-tale. We can play pretend until the break of dawn, and dance with the dew drops as the sun sings its way into the sky. Take my hand, come laugh with me! We'll chase the butterflies and bees until we cannot breathe. You'll see, we will be happy until the end, just you and me."

So, how are you today? I hope you responded with "good" or something of that sort. I was in a weird mood today, easily irritated. But, that is beside the point, I am afraid. 

Today's chain of events: me going to the dentist, going to check out some fabulous books from the library! Talking with Alex and Dan, and avoiding (successfully!) TV all day! :) 

I have no Cavities! None at all! I also opened my jounral on the computer, which was collecting non-existant dust, and wrote for an hour and a half to catch myself up. I wrote 6 pages! That's a lot of typing, so my fingers are kind of tired tonight. Pardon the shortened entry.

I have such good people in my life! Today, I feel like talking about Dan. Dan and I never really dated, seeking a pain-free relationship (turning out to be the exact opposite!) but that was long ago, and we are best of friends at this point. I cannot say how nice it is to have someone to talk to that isn't a girl, that won't blurt it out, and who can be trusted with everything. We have been best of friends for a long time now, and he has always been very patient and soothing when things arent exactly going right. I hope I do a good job at comforting him when he is feeling distressed! He is a very kind and compassionate person, who would rather harm come to himself than any of his friends. He has gone through some intense ordeals in his life, and conquered them at full force! Huzzah! :) He is an amazingly strong person to deal with issues he has come to face, and I admire that to the highest.

I fear I am dwelling on Justin a bit heavily, and allowing myself to miss him too much. It is interesting, I missed him like mad when I left for Montana, but I had things to keep my mind busy there. Now it seems like I cannot go 5 minutes without a cluster of thoughts of him coming to my mind, me being euphoric, then discovering he won't be back for another 2 weeks. If only I could talk to him! Just for a few minutes! Just to tell him I am thinking of him and love him like no other!!!

Whine.

Sorry for whining, guys. I'm over it. I am feeling quite tired, now. But, oh! I must remember! August 20th, 8:30 am. Pictures for the hall for tennis. REMEMBER THAT! ::hits head::

Goodnight

      What a day. My day starts out on the wrong side of the bed, I'm not awake at 10:30 (pathetically late for me) and grouchy with my mother (this trend continues throughout the day, mind you... trouble is in store for my conscience!) At this point (10:38 AM) I am still stuck on a dream I had of the Segals all coming to the Braddock Pool instead of Montana. Bill was very skinny and sickly-looking. He must have been ill. I was talking to him and walking around the concrete lip around the water and I couldn't keep my balance. I fell in quite a few times, but I blamed it on me being sick, which I was not. I kept thinking about Justin, and knew that this was a day I should be with him, but he was away somewhere and I couldn't see him or talk to him. Bill took me over to the fence where there was gravel on a small hill, and when we walked up, the hill traveled with our feet and wouldn't end. This dream was very annoying and pathetically true-- I miss the Segals, I miss Montana, I miss Justin and I am feeling sad for my grandfather who has problems with his balance. There is more to it, I am sure, like the hill may represent hiking up the mountains or the steps taken to become a better person (whether that means physical, mental or emtional health, or maybe health has nothing to do with it.) I'll just cut the interpretation short, as I don't particularly feel like disecting it. 
I must say, before I seem rude in not mentioning it sooner, as I should be excstatic about today, that July 25, 2004 is Justin and my one-and-a-half year "anniversary". The interesting thing is, and this is a depressing point, he was neither here to share it with me nor available on the telephone. So I was completely lonely, celebrating with no one on what should have been a happy day. I was not really unhappy, just lazy. I never changed out of my PJs. That doesn't EVER happen. Only on Christmas Day, and rarely then because we have company. I wasn't able to see anyone or keep myself busy in any way except watching TV (which is a horid habit and I refuse to watch any TV for the rest of summer other than a new show called "The 4400" that I am currently trying to watch weekly. I am not very good at it, and have missed 2 of the 4 episodes...) playing the piano (more like pounding) and reading. I took a nap, which explains my hyper nature at this point, and thought of Justin a lot. 
Last night I looked through my entire hard-drive to find my journal I was keeping. In finding it, I realized how I have been in love with Justin for a very long time. I started the journal on Feb. 17, 2003, which is 9 days after our first date (to the movies, RC theatre, Sam, Neera, Joe, Kaitlyn, Justin and I to "The Recruit" at 4:30 PM--I know this because I found the ticket stub in Dad's car yesterday) And even then, I was completely enamored with him. I must (shamefully) admit that I still referred to him by his last name. A simply vile thing for a girlfriend to do! How silly of me! :) (that trend ended in early March.) I don't think there was anything negative about him in there. Just a few comments about a certain talent show that I won't revisit, but regret and will feel bad about forever. I have a weird protective instinct... probably derived from my sister looking older than she is. End of that story.
So back to this diary, it is full of sweet things about us and how incredibly happy he made me and there are lists of things I love about him, it's very silly-sounding, but I was smiling the whole time in reading it because it was so refreshing to see how far we've come, and how my feelings for him have developed and grown so much stronger and deeper. The time I've shared with him has been no less than heavenly (hence, the title) and I would not have rathered it any other way. There are so many things I love about him, but since I am new at this online-journaling, I am timid in writing them all down. I find things between a couple so intimate or so plain are best kept between the two. It is a very personal thing talking about a relationship. 
Which brings up this question: Why are onlookers of long-term relationships very interested in the status, development and even interaction between the couple? For example, the annoying and very perverted question, "What have you guys done?" I have seen asked a billion times of my friends... and they answer! Openly! About their physical relationship with another person completely uninvolved! I cannot answer that question! I will not! "What have you guys done?" Why would anyone on earth ask something like that and actually expect an answer?! I am putting that one to rest. To anyone reading this, refrain from asking all couples of one week, one year, one decade or anyone for that matter what they have done with the opposite sex. It is a very personal thing to be discussing, and if they openly tell you because they trust in your closed-mouth response, good, but if you ask this question out of the blue, I do hope you will a) think before asking, b) don't expect an answer, and c) if you recieve an answer, by goodness, DO NOT SHARE THAT INFORMATION! Stay out of other peoples' buisness, darn it!

I wasn't completely anti-social today, although I didn't get to see people face-to-face. I caught up with Greg, who called me and informed me of his new and budding relationship with Allison. I must say, it is a very sweet thing to hear because he is a very nice, smart and talented person. (I know this because I dated him for a mere month. It was an interesting month, but we weren't at all prepared for something long term. Well, one of us wasn't.) He is a lot like me, actually. His dad is a doctor, my mom is a doctor, he is musical, philisophical, and very intelegent, etc. I enjoy our conversations very much. Today's main topic, other than him sharing his love life, was religion. He and Allison are not the same religion, which is not a problem at all. She is a firm believer in Christianity and he is Jewish. We discussed that having blind faith is dangerous, and that the Bible is composed of people who had blind faith and it worked out. How many people weren't mentioned, (assuming, for this entry, that the bible was written in the time of Jesus or at least has truth in it) that got screwed out of their blind faith? One must ask questions about religion in order to have an understanding of what they believe. You cannot know all the facts to make a good assumption other than a book that may not even be real. I cannot possibly think that everything in there is true, considering Jesus probably did not have time, while waiting to be crucified, to write the Bible. Maybe he did, I don't know, and I won't know, but I do know that when I have a good perspective on life and make my own choices and decisions, I will move into having faith. As of now, I believe highly that there is a higher power. Whether that is a God, a goddess, many gods and goddesses, I am not sure, but when I decide to do my homework and research it, I will figure things out for myself. I do not want to be sold religion or be told what to believe. (or recieve forwards that tell me I will die if I don't pass it on because Jesus will come down and burn me or something horrible of that nature.)
See, the best part about talking to Greg is we get into arguments where we are both on one side and we discuss it like we are debating. But we debate the same point. It is amusing and good for thinking and saying things that you need to say. Debate practice, if you will. 
Today I also talked to Alex who I met last summer at tennis camp. He is a very nice person. He recently visited Germany with his teacher and fellow students, and I am interested in seeing pictures of this trip. When we were at tennis camp, he sang to Jill and me on the bus back from the movies. "Your Eyes", which is a sweet song, and he has a good voice too! 
"Your eyes
as we said our good byes
can't get them out of my mind
and I find I can't hide

From your eyes 
the ones that took me by surprise
the magic came into my life
where theres moonlight, I see your eyes

How'd I let you slip away 
when I'm longing so to hold you?
now I'd die for one more day 
cause theres something I should have told you-
theres something I should have told you

When I look into your eyes
why does distance make us wise?
You were the song all along
and before the song dies-

I should tell you-
I should tell you-
I have always loved you
you can see it in my eyes"

Isn't that a beautiful song? I should get the music to it. ::sigh:: I hope I will be able to see him sometime soon. I like playing tennis with him, he is good. We have a lot of things in common, like a love for Root Beer. haha!

Those were happy notes of my day. I wish that I could speak to Justin, though. Where is he now? I wish I could kiss him on the cheek and tell him that I love him. :( ::wish wish wish:: I guess it doesn't work if it's not possible to happen. 

Well, as I have nothing more to talk about, I will be off to bed. Maybe I will have better dreams! 'Night.

      Today I got up early to go play a tennis match. I was nervous to some extent because of my lack of play for so long. I surprised myself, though, and played quite well in singles with Lindsey Main. I won 6-4, 6-2. Singles is fun, I need to work on some consistancy problems, though. 
Afterwards, I went to the farmers' Market with Mom and I bought my orchid! It is so beautiful, resembling a tiger. It is very exotic-looking. We bought lots of produce and random things, it was nice. I saw this kid who bought a huge sunflower and I though it was so sweet. He smiled at me, and I smiled back. He had a nice smile. It was a good start of a day.
Later, Wenning called and after our hour long conversation, she invited me over. I went over at 2:00, and we chatted about China and MT, shared pictures (China is amazing!) and played around with computers, iPods, and music files that didn't work! Then, I saw her goodies from China (ink, pens, pen sets, acrylics, etc--too much to write!) It was quite awesome! Lots of pirated manga! So cool! We checked out ebay for "belts" (tablets, but we had to disguise the name so her dad wouldn't know what we were discussing!) It was so much fun. We walked down to Collamor's, but it was closed (ugh) and so we got some food at Subway. The second time that it has happened--Subway rather than Collamor's. 
The day was great! Mom and dad are now at dinner, and I have written all I can for this entry. I have had, for 3 days, Amber stuck in my head. 

Amber is the color of your energy.
Justin, I love you. I miss you.

      Today was my first day of an 18-day examination period of my life. This 18 days will be spent completely disconnected, to my discontent, from Justin. He left, officially, for South Carolina early this morning.
I'm not in the mood to be alone, really, but I am keeping myself busy. I am trying to reconnect with my wonderful friends from school, and today was Ellen's day.
Recap: We played tennis, talked about APEX and the Scarlet Letter, discussed new ideas for the new year! Remembered, fondly, the last year, and tried our best not to pass out in the humid heat. Here is my list for new things for our APEX group for the summer and upcoming school year:
> Have the group together for a reunion before summer ends. It really would be a shame not to.
> Become mentors/ tutors of new APEX students (we were the guinea pigs--we should give them what we didn't get) 
> Set up a support system via email or telephone for the new, impossible course lists for next year. Agh!

Extensive... hm.
So yes, today I am feeling down. I skipped swim team because of horrible nausea and pain. I should have gone, I love the water.
I ended up walking up to the pool later with Erica anyway, it was nice. I am so irritable with Mom lately. I need to work on that. 
I have discovered that I hate IMing people. For example, last night I was very sad when Justin was talking to me, as he was leaving, and it was broken conversation. Totally frustrating, because I couldn't say what I felt and he didn't seem to be in the conversation much either. Just an example, I am not being critical. It is just a thought-there is no one at the other end of your IM. Just responses from people that make them up. Who knows who you are really talking to! Is a screen name proof enough?! What happened to face-to-face conversation, and phone calls. I love phone calls... I can talk to people for hours and hours on the phone, but online it isn't really that person. It is another person that abbreviates words like wuts goin on? nm, u? SO ANNOYING! I am thinking of giving up IMs for a while, just emails that say more than a line of useless talking things.
Ugh, see, irritable. I wish it didn't matter. It is a nice way to talk to people you can't talk to on the phone, but I'd really rather talk with a voice.

      Today was a day for flyfishermen! I planned a day for Justin and I to go to the pool and Middletown Park for a flyfishing lesson. :) What a great day...
We met at the pool, and swam for about 45 minutes. We talked, shivered, laughed, played and it was wonderful. I love swimming with him, although I needed to keep moving to stay warm. I wasn't trying to swim away, though it may have seemed so :) He is gorgeous in the water... how can he be so tan?! Lacrosse camp is a wonderful thing *-*. We got out and talked for a while, warming up. (I think he was pretty much freezing the whole time in the pool! haha) I gave him my towel because it was warm. I love his towel (it smells exactly like it did when I borrowed it last summer.) ::rememberance:: We walked home together (slowly) and he held my hand... (I love holding his hand!) He's so warm all the time... anyway, we got in the house and fed him some pesto (I gave him a blue rubberband) and we got ready for the park.
It was such a playful lesson! We were almost completely alone in the park, which was sweet because it was a beautiful day, and the water was nice, and everything was blooming and green. It was quite romantic-- it made me extremely happy! I taught him knots, which he mastered, and he wasn't too bad at casting either. (A little work will come in future fishing lessons) Anyway, we threw this huge fly in and played around with the fishes and he caught one!!!!! It was such a cutie! (A small bluefish) It was sweet :) He loved it, and didn't want to stop fishing, which is incredibly relieving because of my desire to have him come to Montana (someday)... 
It was so much fun being with him today... I loved sitting on his towel messing around with flyline and tying flies... it was total bliss. :) I can't wait to fish with him again. I want him to catch a trout, not the stupid MD fish. I love him so much, it was a very impressive day for him. :)

      So today I will simply recap the happenings of the Ringle trip to Montana!
We drove into Jackson Hole, WY, and stopped for lunch at a small Mexican restaurant (called Abuelito's, if I recall correctly.) We window shopped the town for an hour or so and then traveled through Yellowstone to our hotel in Ennis, Montana. On the way we stopped at Old Faithful (in the rain, haha) and the Galytan (a river) to fish. I caught nothing! After dropping our stuff off in the room, we set off for the dam below Ennis Lake. I caught nothing, again, but Erica caught 2 and I think Dad caught something. (Erica caught very few fish on the whole trip, so this was a good day!) 
One night, coming back from below the dam, the moon came up from behind the mountains and it was HUGE! It lit up the whole sky, somewhat like the sun, and it was so astonishing we couldn't stop staring!
It is hard to recap every event from the trip on a daily basis, so a basic over-all of events will have to do!
We reunited with the Segals (William, Nick, Betsy, Bill--no Allison, as she was taking an Organic Chemistry course at North Western) and met some new people! (Bonnie, Gabor, their kid Marta, her husband Charels, their kid Calem, somehow related to the Segals. Then, Monty, Betsy's brother, his wife Jinette, and their kids Ansel [a year older than me] and Mia [a year younger than Erica]. Also, Bug, Betsy's sister, her husband Randy and their dog, Lillie.)
We fished with the Segals, mostly, but we did go on a float with ALL of the crew listed above (minus Jinette, Monty and Mia) which was quite a feat! I was on Randy's boat with Ansel and Erica. I caught 1 fish, Ansel caught 3, Erica with 0. We had food fights, discussed allowances, talked about interests, talked about jobs, talked in spanish (fun), learned insults in spanish (ex: eres una mariposa de pato, or, basically, a fairy. haha!) Then, we pirated oreos and special chocolate from the other boats. We ate a lot on this trip, mind you. A LOT! 
Everyone was having a good time on that float! It was very nice to finally meet Randy. He is hillarious! :) What a nice guy.
We ate lunch and dinner with the Segals. Most dinners were around midnight, which is not unusual for Montana, just because of the lack of time constraints on a vacation. Also, fishing can go until 10:30. It is so much fun with the Segals, anyway. It keeps things interesting. I hope they will open the doors for new social oppertunities because goodness knows we need it! It's great meeting people through them. 
One of the nights we united at the Segals' home, Nick and I devised some explosives. It was very fun, although the fuses did not work. It was not a very successful show, but it was fun blowing up coke cans!
Erica and I went on a float with William (I caught 4 fish, Erica caught a HUGE one, but lost it.) It was very, very awesome to talk to him. He is incredibly smart and modest, not to mention hilarious! It was very cool to talk about music with him. He likes Eminem and has produced raps from the background music of some Eminem songs. They are very technical and have well thought-out lyrics. I enjoy them very much. In our conversation about music and rhyming, The Postal Service came up with "Such great heights". I was not aware that anyone would know that music! :) We talked about a lot of things; friends, boys, girls, parties, poor judgement, etc. It was very fulfilling. 
William also played the piano every night, mostly Mozart pieces. It was so relaxing to listen to. He is a wonderful pianist. I should burn the CD Besty has with his recorded music. We stayed in their house for 2 days (the 4th and 5th) and he would play as we went to bed. It was absolutely beautiful... 
On the 4th of July, the Ennis Parade was the main event! All of the buisnesses of the tiny town made floats and drove (slowly) down the road in front of a huge crowd. There were hundreds of hundreds of people! It was very fun and funny. Lots of pictures. Afterwards, we ate lunch with everyone and set out for fishing. That night, everyone (people we didn't know, mostly) went to Virginia City for dinner and fireworks. Everyone in the bar was drunk, and very rude when it was time for the fireworks, but it was all-around good. The waitress tried serving 30 people at once, which was stupid, and it took an hour to get our salads. During that time, the kids' table (Mia, Ansel, William, Marta (is she a kid? No!), Calem (too young) Nick, Erica and me) drew things. It was very fun. Nick and Ansel had a crush on the waitress (not that attractive, if you ask me) but she was "taken". It was funny to see them flirt, though! :] 
We did some hikes while in MT. Bill, Betsy, Nick, William and the Ringles went up to Indian Creek. I caught a fish there, not much else for anyone (Nick got a couple--though he is a Guru and that is incredibly admirable. I wish I had that drive!) It was very pretty. Betsy got lots of pictures. The water was cold and fast and beautiful. Even when it rained!
Everyone went up to the Gravelly Road for wild flowers. It was intoxicatingly beautiful. Ansel, Mia, Erica, Nick and I went into the woods (why? I don't think there was a reason...) and after about 10 minutes, Nick spotted some scratch marks on a sappling with sap still dripping. They must have been from a bear, a small one, with a mother around.... so we ran out of there. It was a bit scary... thank goodness we didn't get ourselves into a bad situation! And thank goodness Nick has good eyes...
Lots of pictures on the Gravelly, so many wild flowers! (I may have to post them) 
We went to Cliff Lake on the last night... how beautiful! That may be the most beautiful place I have ever been. The water doesn't move, and there is no civilization for miles and miles! There is infinant wild life and trees and fresh air and fish and... oh it was so perfect! The sun went down, a breathtaking sunset coated the sky. It was wonderful.
The stars are also wonderful because of the lack of humidity and fumes. It was such a wonderful trip, going home was impossibly hard. Saying goodbye to the Segals alone was really hard. :( I hate leaving. I wish mom and dad had bought the million dollar property (not mentioned, but it was too much of a temptation to buy, and shouldn't be mentioned. It was a big house with a piece of river.) so we could have visitors ourselves. :) I can think of one person I would have loved to have with me...

      Mom and Dad left with Bill and Besty at noon for "The Producers", a hilarious play where a bankrupt producer bribes his financial assistant to produce a spoof-play, a sure flop, to make some money! It is hilarious! I am angry they did not take us with them. They could have included us, though Dad said there were not many kids under my age. That was to be expected--some crude humor was involved. Erica and I did not have anything to do, so were amusing ourselves with ripping music for the iPod, watching the Olympics, chilling out... etc. It was very bogus. I was lonely, wanting conversation and someone (only one person, really) to hold my hand and give me a hug. 

I must say, I could have chosen a better time to run... I decided to go run in the rain! The only bad thing about it was I had to concentrate too much on protecting the iPod. It was so nice to run in a summer rain... oh yes! It was quite an experience... :) I came back to the house totally soaked! It was exhilerating. 

After I got home, I cleaned up the house, then made a quiche with Erica. It had brocolli, chicken, peppers, tomatoes and cheese in it. GOOD! I like quiche. I, unfortunately, spent 3 hours trying to find a quiche recipie and I was spelling it wrong. 

I am trying to deal with plans that Mom is making for my grandmother to come out. She makes my mom too stressed... I don't want to see how things go where she is staying in our house! AH! 

I want to talk to Justin. ::sigh:: I am selfish. 

I am going to bed, the Olympics are getting a little bit boring, considering we have watched them ALL DAY! AH! Goodnight :)

      I skipped a day. It will go down with me to the grave. Today I hung out with Wenning! ^.^ She is my favorite person to be around! She's a very feel-good, smart and funny person. More things than previously mentioned, so many more!, but none the less, it was really great getting to see her. We cooked ourselves lunch (pasta with tomatoes, arugula and garlic--yum!) and it was very fun cooking with her! It tasted great! I can't believe, though that Mom made me cook it for them later (I had salad). In fact, I am not happy with Mom now, she is acting very hypocritical. Oh well! Over her, anyway... Wenning and I tried desperately and fruitlessly to download the manga/anime onto my computer last year.... eep! It's annoying! Hopefully I can sort them out... :(. I loveth manga and anime because of that girl! I officially succeeded in purchasing her a tablet (A.K.A. "belt!") for her today! That was very cool. It should arrive next week. More beautiful art from Wenning Xu! Whee! Yeah! So, the Olympics started today, too. Only the opening. It took roughly 5 hours. I did not watch it all. I talked to Justin :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) I love him!
Yes! I adore being with him, he makes me a better person. I love everything when I am with him.
I must go, I am pooped! Goodnight, then.

      It is pouring down rain outside, accompanied nicely with thunder and lightning! Quite a beautiful thing, if you would ask me. I love storms. I was standing out on my balcony (metal... stupid though, thinking back!) and letting it rain on me... How can the drops be so warm? I thought to myself... I love the rain! It is such a nice feeling to get drenched... and these are the big raindrops, in which you can hear each individual one hit your skin if you listen hard enough! I am hoping that this will pass, though. I do want to see the meteor shower tomorrow night! I also would like to go fishing.

So, I finally did it-- I broke my record of doing one of these blogs each night! I skipped last night! Yoga ran over the time I had left for it, and it was already today by the time I could have written. (You catch that one?) 

Today I hung out with mom! She did some errands at a nursing home... it was depressing :( we were in an elevator with this woman who was so distressed and crying for her home and family... and it looks like she had been a resident for a while! I was trying to hold back tears, and it still make sme choke up a little when I think of her face... so contorted with agony! How hard it must be to be confined not only by your disability but your age to a foreign place with people taking care of you and so much confusion all the time... not in a very memorable environment! I would hate it... it made me very sad.

On a lighter note, I finished Scarlet Letter. Now I don't know what to do with myself. I finally figured out why I prolonged the story--I wanted to read something. I shall read Great Gatsby now. Good-o!

Mom and I stopped for lunch at the Tasting Room and got filet minogne with frites! Yeah! It was delicious! Yum. We celebrated Dad's birthday today, although his real birthday was yesterday (happy birthday Daddy!) and it was cool. He got some presents :) and some cards :) and some cake! 

My day was otherwise uneventful. Wait, that's a lie. I went school supply shopping but did not get everything I needed! Other than THAT, my day was uneventful. I am simply enjoying the rain, which I think is diminishing now :( sad, really. Oh well! I need some sleep and Yoga time! Goodnight!

      Today was great. Impeccible beauty, relaxation, no sister around, reading, walking, cleaning... talking to the one I love more than anything else in the world :) making plans, being happy! I had such a great day! Erica is currently attending a horse camp with a woman who has been teaching her lessons since she was 6. This is a troubling factor now, considering Erica has (a) purchased a horse (b) is boarding it in another stable and (c) has much outgrown the nest. She has finally made huge strides that she has always wanted to make (ex. showing, having her own horse, paying her way through pampering this horse) and this teacher, Lois, of the out-grown place cannot provide that for her anymore. It was bound to happen. Anyway, so Lois is giving Erica an unusually hard time about not going to both weeks of the camp because Gavin (horse) is having problems with his feet... this does not make sense to me. I do not understand how she can hold a grudge against someone who helped her build her new barn... heartless, it is. So she wasn't too happy in coming home today. It was nice to have her back. She is much funnier when we don't see each other all day. Upon her return, we decided to go to the pool instead of me running and her tred-milling. It was a very nice evening for the pool. The sun was setting so the light was just beautiful--very dense and liquid-like to begin with, even without the water. The reflection off of everything wet made it so much more beautiful. There weren't many people. It was so relaxing, freezing, and refreshing! Why haven't we gone later before (6:00 PM-ish)

How wonderful it is just to lay outside and read. Even if that book is "The Scarlet Letter" (which I have 20 more pages to read! Huzzah!). I was very happy to do so today. It was a lazy day, sort of, other than cleaning the house. I finished the job of dog-sitting. Our neighbors returned home today. I should have left a note for them, but I did not think of this soon enough... +_+

Whee! I am so happy! I get to celebrate my dad's birthday (which is really tomorrow but not celebrated tomorrow because of the horrible times mom and dad get home) on Wednesday, see Justin on Thursday, Wenning on Friday, buy my concert tickets on Saturday... possibly go flyfishing on Sunday! Wheee! Huzzah!

Goodnight! I am feeling fine and want to do some yoga! I was bad and skipped last night!

      What a wonderful day today was! I am excited to say I went to Justin's BBQ with all of his family today. Well, SOME of his family. I am having a hard time believing there could be more... but they were all wonderful and nice! I love that I can be around so many people, even though I knew no one and had a diffcult time at first in starting conversations... but it went smoother when the food was out! It is so nice to get to meet people that are so... wonderful! I don't know... I guess it is because I have not much family of my own. 

I talked to Justin' grandmother who got into talking about Kerry's position in the election (she is very republican) and so she got Justin's uncle into that conversation... then, somehow, we started talking about kids with anger management problems and their ignorant parents, so I jumped in with the story of the jerk at our tennis match in Leisburg, and that started a conversation about tennis. It turns out that a girl at the BBQ, Brittney, plays tennis for Walkersville. She played 3rd doubles and played against Cat and Kellie. Our girls were not to polite to their girls. We were talking about them a bit! There was so much great food. Justin's mom gave me some watermellon to get rid of the huge load they had that no one seemed to eat. It was such a great time. The best part was I got to hang out with Justin! We played pool and watched a movie, all with his cousins, etc., and it was so pleasant! I love him so much... it was so hard waiting for him to come back, but it was worth it in the long run. I cannot wait to see him again! Hehehe! He got me rum balls (candies) and a shirt from the Islands! The shirt fits perfectly and is very cute :) I love it! And the rum balls are awesome! I am afraid to eat too many--there is rum in them! They are delicious... yum yum!

I am so tired... cannot think of what to write now! I will write more when I have more energy! Today was wonderful and I am so happy I got to share it with Justin and his family! :)

      Justin is home! He came back! From South Carolina! I am so incredibly happy! And tomorrow I get to see him :) For HOURS! And meet all of his family! I shall enjoy myself immensely. I can't wait! I've waited for so long to see him, it seems. Eighteen days is a very long time to be away from someone that close... I am so happy you are back, I am so, so, so happy!   
my heart sinks   
i move involuntarily   
there is no light left for me   
and then   
thank heaven   
you speak to me   
and i awake from the dead   
light shatters through my eyes   
piercing the darkness   
and i love again   
color returns to my cheeks   
with a once forgotten smile   
i am happy   
you made me happy   
and i love you   

I love you... I am so glad you are home, Justin. You are something greater than I could deserve. I love you! I love you! I love you! I am so excited to see you tomorrow! Today's events are not important, just tennis and taking care of dogs... I am just so happy Justin is home. :) :)

      Today we recieve the schedules:

 Semester one:
   >AP World History - Hozien
   >English 10 - Leonard
   >Spanish 4 - Neuland
   > Biology - Sterger

 Semester two:
   > Chemistry - Thomas
   >AP World History - Hozien
   >Biotechnology (term 3) - Staley
   >Comm. Tech (term 4) - Nelson
   >Pre-cal - Szpara

Exciting schedule, hmm? Well, today I am just drained. I have done nothing else but move today. For example, we went shopping through the mall in less than an hour, going to every store (and I don't even know why were shopping again today anyway) but it was nice--except that we didn't find anything worth buying! How obnoxious. I did purchase the Modest Mouse CD, entitled "Good news for people who love bad news". Appropriate for the Americans. And humans in general. ::scoff:: Today I do not think I will be able to talk to Justin. I have run myself dry of missing him, it's like my body is grinding itself down to nothing now that it has lost its inspiration. I am a pathetic mass of flesh and feeling. I do not know how to comprehend much now, I suppose this happens when one loses their muse. I cannot focus on one thing. Now, my brain is going from one thing to another, and it feels like I have no heart, just an empty, cold space where it may have been once, but I don't know if I can remember that point. Yesterday my heart was swollen and today it has evaporated into sheer vacuum space. Frictionless, air-less, nothingness. Less than nothingness, there is not even 'nothing' in a vacuum, as one knows who has taken physics. Sheesh, I am boring. I miss Justin too much today, and I can't do anything to make him come back sooner. I hope he calls me tomorrow when he gets in. I think I will shatter without hearing from him. 

Getting my schedule today makes me scared. I fear I will not be able to see Justin at all. I really don't think I can go on with a whole school year without seeing him between classes. Luckily enough we have time to find one another for a few blissful minutes of something so minor as staring into each other's eyes, just to memorize the patterns and dwell upon them for the next class. That would be fulfilling. I was thinking, in trying to sleep last night--a daunting and fruitless task, mind you-- how perfect our seats were this year as freshmen where we could just hold onto each other for a mere 9 minutes, but now the new freshmen will have to sit there and we will be pushed into the middle-crowd, less privacy. I will miss this spot. Good memories. I do hope that we share a lunch shift next year. Hope! I have hope, and considering I do not know his schedule yet, I am hopeful and dreadful at the same instant. I feel like huddling in a small corner at this moment, I feel small and useless. 

Summer is dwindling. I am currently using this time to babysit dogs, (dog-sit?), reading like mad, lazing around! Sleeping! Ahh! Snap out of this! I want to fish, I have been running, and get high off of it daily (oh yes, running with music to live by!) It is a wonderful thing. I am so lost for things to do. I wish I could play tennis every day. I am very lathargic. Sad ending. So much for the end of summer being a blast. I think I will just dwell on going to a concert :) That brings smiles to my face!! Huzzah! :) Music is my haven... I am such a confusing person, I cannot tell you! It is impossible to continue this argument with myself without boring the audience, which consists of few to begin with, but to stop the vent would be trecherous, moreso than continuing... so then, what more do I have to say? I am eager to have something stable return to my days, make them brighter, have something to look forward to in the day, something (someone, rather) to run for, to hope to see driving by, or run into in Safeway, or talk to for hours into the night, then think about later that night... Urg, doesn't this self-pity just rush over and constrict your stomach upon reading? I am much in need of a hot, sunny day where I can go and ebb my pity away with the water. It was too cold today for the pool. A mere 70 degrees. Wow. I went on a walk with my mother, though. My mommy and a dog I am taking care of. He is named Dakota, and is a German Shepard. He is large and intimidating and I love him. He is a good walker and a lovely dog. He recognizes me when I get to the house, obviously glad for the company, and is sad to see me leave. :) Dogs are great things.

I must stop this, I have so much jumbled in my head but can't get it out right now. Things must clear up in a few hours. Few hours meaning something like 18, at least. Come quickly, my love! I have waited for you for much longer that I am willing to wait!

      Today my heart is a fleshy mass of swollen massy flesh. Why can't I just be happy genuinely, through and through, without these little twinges of "oh man, life isn't so great" but I can't think that way! SUMMER IS ENDING! Urg, so I am not having a bad day but things went wrong anyway, but what kind of day is it when things ALL go right? A NONEXISTANT day, and dont you come up to me and try to make me believe otherwise. I am unconvinced and will remain so. Perpetual happiness is impossible and if you have it I really hope you enjoy looking around you and seeing what a crappy job human nature has done to provide perpetual happiness. I also hope you perpetually-happy people enjoy hearing about the non-happiness of others. maybe you can provide us all comfort, and ihope we dont drag you down with us! Sorry about that, I miss Justin. And today, we went to the movies to see "De-lovely" STUPID MOVIE! DON'T SEE IT! It will possess your mind with boring thoughts! So we snuck out and into I-Robot, and saw the last 30 minutes. Not bad, but we didn't get to see how it began so it was a pretty crappy day all around. Other than that, I took care of the dogs down the street, walked my dog, ran for 30 minutes, and ate dinner around 9:00! Whee! I am totally pooped from sleeping horribly last night, so goodnight!

      So today was the day of shopping, eh? I was not exactly prepared for this news. I was keen on running and swimming and eating little. Oh well, this plan worked. Mom got back from her hair appointment around 2:00, so we headed out from there. We hit down-town Frederick, going to Orvis and some art stores as well as book and clothing shops. It was nice, but the heat was oppressive. We got some gifts for my dad for his birthday next Tuesday and some stuff for myself too! I got three pairs of well-deserved pants, and three books: one on Astronomy (it will come in handy VERY soon!), one on biodeversity (facts about animals and biology!) and one on calculus. Very cool! I will PASS that course, I tell you! Pass it! I will start as soon as I finish that persistent "Scarlet Letter"...

After arriving home in a storm, I was whisked away to babysit for our neighbors and their girl Kia. It was cool, we watched the Simpsons and talked about vacations and school starting. She has grown up a lot. My dad brought over steaks for dinner (thank goodness! I was starving) and they were awesome! Yum yum yum. :) It was a good day, but I am afraid that other than what I have written, there is not much else to write about! :-\ 

Plus, I am distracted with this journal, and want to talk to Justin (wow, I think this is 3 nights in a row I've talked to him on-line!) without interruption! So goodnight, goodnight!

      As was the plan, Ellen, Wenning, myself and Connie met at Connie's for her belated birthday celebration! Ariana could not make it because of finding the place. I did not have a gift, and frankly, was embarassed! But this is to pass, because I have a good plan! Executed later! So, Go-Karts were first, because at this point we had nothing to do and thought that Ari was to join us, so we decided to amuse ourselves in the waiting time. The majority (Ellen, Wenning and I) were wearing sandals, which is not allowed, so we had to rent these acrid, pungent, not to mention squishy, tennis shoes... it was disgusting. I was against it! But I am glad I caved in. Anywho, we started out on the small course, where Connie miraculously managed to spin out and Wenning hit her (twice). After this, we moved to the larger course where we, unfortunately, had to share with boys that were very competative, and rammed our carts with frequency! I was angry with them. They must have passed us 5 times! Amusing to some extent. My brakes didn't work--that was interesting, too. 

After the Go-Karts, we discovered Ariana was not to be joining us, and after icecream and slushies, we went to play Putt-Putt. It started out friendly enough, the balls were cooperating, going in the holes occasionally, but by hole 8 (of 19) the balls were getting hot just like we were, (it was swealtering! No clouds, no shade, no breeze, humid as steam) we decided to help the balls along a bit! It became more a game of hockey than mini-golf. Very amusing! We all ended up with hole-in-ones on almost every hole! It was hilarious. Wenning spent most of her time raging against her ball and then having to chase it out of trees, bushes, gravel, sand... :) fun times! We were so exhausted from heat by the end of the round that we basically loitered around the water fountain for 20 minutes soaking up all the cool goodness we could! Water doesn't usually taste that good... After that we all went out for pizza, sharing stories about vacations and horror stories about coming home. It was fun! Then we all trecked back to Connie's where she opened her presents and we played with her dogs. At that point it was time to leave, so we said our good-byes and thank-yous, and got taken home! What a great day! 

After getting home, I ran 3 miles. That was kind of stupid in the heat, but it felt good. It's a weird sensation breathing but feeling like you are breathing in liquid, too. It was relieving. I came home, made some dinner for the family which I did not eat (pizza, remember?) and stretched instead. I finished my book, "1984", which depressed me greatly! He gives himself over to Big Brother! No! It couldn't have ended that way, I would have guessed it but did not want to admit it. He no longer loves the woman he loved so deeply, and she no longer loves him... it is really sad. It ended so abruptly that I was looking for more pages! I suggest it to anyone--it is a good read. Erica decided to be an internet hog tonight, which half-explains my late entry, so I performed some Yoga. Tonight's pose that struck me as interesting and hilarious was the Lion where you actually stick your tongue out as far as you can and bulge your eyes while sitting. It is very funny to look at, and thought I was alone while doing it, I had trouble not laughing! I guarentee that there is a picture on Google of it. Check it out. 

I actually am talking to Justin at the moment (on-line, of course) and I need to remember to call his mother about the BBQ Sunday. REMEMBER THAT. :) I love him. I can't wait until he comes back, it's impossible to be without him. I wonder if he is thinking of me as often and with such intensity as I think of him? Something nice to dwell on before sleeping :) 'Night.

      Today was not special, but it was a good day, none the less. I am sorry to say that I did not get to talk to Justin today, but the night is young! Maybe he will surprise me and turn up on line later! I can hope! Anywho, my uneventful day was made up of swimming laps, eating lunch, reading, more swimming, catching up with Brian (!) and napping. It was very relaxing. I learned that I am going to join my sisterhood tomorrow for Putt-Putt :) Yay for Connie's birthday! I can't wait :) I love seeing everyone! I am also very excited about this weekend... it will be a great weekend, I can say as much to be exactly true! I am so very happy today, and I am not sure how to pinpoint why... it is odd, how a day of complete relaxation can revive a person. Undoubtedly, I have no news. I am completely blank of stories, thoughts, feeling, even, except for this numb-happy feeling I have. :) Goodnight, sweet dreams!

      Today was wonderful! Absolutely fantastic! Super-terrific! (Alright, enough with the annoying adjectives) But, really, today was very good. Last night I went to Ellen's for the night, and that was so much fun to see Connie, Wenning and Ariana as well as Ellen! We played games in her pool, ate tons of food, played Chinese checkers, watched "Ocean's Eleven" and "Robin Hood, Men in Tights", talked (a lot! more on that later) and had fun! It was so cool-- I can't believe I haven't seen them more this summer. It is unreal to me that we can be so close but so far away. Vacations are annoying, sometimes. 

When it was time to go to sleep, we all talked for a while until Ellena dn Connie fell alseep. Ariana and I could not find the desire to be un-hyper, so, after realizing we were both dehydrated, we moved to the kitchen to talk more. (This is at 2:00 AM) We talked about everything--from family to 9/11, to Bush, then leaving politics to talk about love, friendship, more family, experiences, memories, stories.... it was such a relief to talk like that with such an intenity of listening and learning and the interest shared. It was very informative and relaxing to talk to someone in such depth. I learned lessons about tolerance, family, acceptance, love, friendship, devotion, happiness.. and that was all from 2:00-5:00 AM in Ellen's house... it was amazing! How else can I put it? I wish words could do it justice. It was a wonderful session, very theraputic and enlightening. We eventually decided we should go to bed, and slept from maybe 5:30 - 8:30. We had to leave at 10:00, which was sad :( but it was such a great time! We will do that at my house next time! Ha!

Today I basically slept off my afternoon, and upon waking, I realized that I needed to read the Custom House. I got unusually absorbed in that, probably because I just needed to get my mind on something stable rather than drifting in and out of sleep. I was almost finished when the phone rang and Erica came bounding up the stairs, screaming that it was Justin! I was so shocked, to the point of disbelief, really, because I thought she would be kidding about it. She wasn't though! It was wonderful to talk to him! He wished me a Happy Anniversary for 18 months, and was extremely sweet on the phone. It sounds like there are some tropical storms brewing around South Carolina--I hope all is well there for the remainder of his trip. When they get home, his mom planned a BBQ that I am invited to and I will get to meet his grandparents on his mom's side! How cool! I can't wait, it will be fun. I am trying to figure out what I will bring food wise... hmm... Anyway, I was so excited to talk to him that I missed the preparation of dinner all together, which wasn't entirely a bad thing. It felt like I only got to talk to him for 5 minutes (really probably a half hour to forty five minutes, I didn't want to keep count) and it made me so giddy that Mom and Dad were laughing at me. I've been walking on a cloud all night, and hopefully I don't fall asleep on the keyboard and miss him if he gets online, as stated earlier. I miss him so much but I am just so happy I got to talk to him! ^.^ Happy happy! :) I'm dead tired but want to talk to him so much! I am silly, I know, but it was just what I needed to get through the next seven days. I think I would have burst if I hadn't heard from him. Oh, how much I love that boy! 

:) :) :) :) :) 

Just the little things that make days great! I love it! Life is sweet with little things! Beautiful dreams to all.
