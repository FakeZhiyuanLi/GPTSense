      i think its fitting that blondie gets first mention.  i'm talking to her right now and well i miss the child.  one of the few people who's actually sincere and can take part in an intelligent conversation.  and, of course, i miss being smacked in the face by all that blonde hair [blondie doing xena without weapons].

      i've spent the evening going through 18 cds picking out songs to rip.  the cds just came in from interlinc, a youth group resource for christian music.  most of the music is generic.  but there are a couple of albums i found worthy of more time.  for some of the stuff i cant really tell why its classified as christian.  could be anything, especially when you cant understand the lyrics.  while the cds would rip i read a few chapters from  'Guns, Germs, and Steel'  by Jared Diamond.  its been a while since i've read anything on anthropology.  the author, a evolutionary biologist of birds, writes about the differences in rates of progress among different cultures all the way from prehistoric times; the cause of and consequences of said differences.  i've also started  Quicksilver  by Neal Stephenson today.  i hadnt planned on reading anything stephenson [never heard of him until march this year] until i came across a critique of his book,  Snow Crash , in another book,  How We Became Post Human .  well, once i started i couldnt put it down.  lol.  then i read  Cryptonomicon  which wasnt half bad.  and last week,  Diamond Age , which was quite good.  a couple of my friends were in Dubai over the weekend.  they got back an hour or so ago :-)

      1.	Life is a series of choices.  Sometimes things may or may not happen whether you choose otherwise. 2.	Raise the level of expectation and you raise the level of disappointment. 3.	Everything eventually passes away.   4.	People are fallible and will eventually fail you. 5.	Life can be as simple or as complicated as you make it. 6.	When you have nothing to lose, only then can you live. 7.	You have nothing to lose when you stop trying to hold on to anyone or anything, when you stop trying to stop change. 8.	Friendship will always be a distant second to a relationship. 9.	If you care too much, you will be hurt. 10.	If it works, stick with it.  If it isn’t broken don’t try to fix it. 11.	Once you know what you like, do it and you will learn contentment. 12.	It takes courage not to conform to the masses. 13.	People will never truly understand you.  There is a divide between you and everyone else that cannot be crossed.  It is what makes you unique. 14.	Strength comes from doing your duty, even if it is unnoticed. 15.	No relationship is true unless you keep the faith. 16.	Sacrifice and duty are easier when there is loyalty. 17.	Love is more a choice than an emotion. 18.	Truth is not a concept.  It is a person – Jesus Christ. 19.	You are restless not because you don’t know yourself.  You are restless because you don’t know the Truth. 20.	Your path in life, your identity, your choices can only be understood in relation to the Truth. 21.	Don’t bother impressing other people.  Let them impress you. 22.	When you stop chasing that which you think you must have, then you find it.  If you do not, then learn contentment. 23.	Responsibility is more important than rights. 24.	You live among stupid people.  Teach them or be consumed. 25.	Pain makes you stronger.   26.	Anything and everything can teach you. 27.	You don’t have control over what emotion comes over you.  But you do have control over how long it lasts. 28.	Don’t go native.  You are only passing through. 29.	You like to think of yourself as basically good.  You are not. 30.	If you are addicted to something, then you are less than human.  An addiction is anything that is master over you. 31.	Once you see your path, stay the course.   32.	Boredom is a state of mind. 33.	Novelty and happiness are not the aims of life. 34.	God is not your cosmic bellhop.  But knowing him is the answer to every need. 35.	If you don’t make a conscious choice, it will be made for you. 36.	The desert is preferable to the city. 37.	Talking about feelings and Self-esteem are overrated.

      i had forgotten that i had created a blog site. lol.  carol reminded me.  well, since i seem to have quite a bit of time on my hands [voluntary leave for a month] i think i may give blogging another stab.  i've been reading  urlLink Andrea Williams  blogs for a while now.  she finally found a job.  whoo hoo!  and its one she wants :-)    i'm still unsure as to what and how much to post.  by nature i am not someone who tells much about myself, even to my friends.  its almost 0400 and i need to find a better hour to sleep.
