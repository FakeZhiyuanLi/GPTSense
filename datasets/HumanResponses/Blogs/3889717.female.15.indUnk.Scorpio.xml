        Some people come into our lives and quickly go. Some stay for awhile and leave footprints on our hearts. And we are never, ever the same..    Yeah, we're ok now.. But I can feel that there's something wrong.. I don't know what that is. But I hope I'll soon find out. I'm so glad we're ok. But things.. will never, ever be the same again.. I assure you that..

        Im ok now! Or should I say we're ok now??? haha..     Tribulations or Misfortunes that happened last week:         July 14 '04, Wednesday-  my beloved doggie Tel'C died. She didn't manage to have a baby..      July 16 '04, Friday-  this was our induction ceremony. Everything seemed to be just fine at the beginning until there were PASAWAY PERSONS that caused our party, party to end. And unfortunately, I turned bad trip because of some not-so-good reactions, comments or whatever that is. Another thing was TEL was there. Of course, for me thats not good. (at the moment that is)      July 17 '04, Saturday-  Ahbi's birthday! We were supposed to have a life in the spirit seminar but I decided not to attend. Reasons: a.) coz of non'stop pa'ambon think I have a flu b.) my voice became hoarse. VERY HOARSE! and c.) tnx to my seatmate, vince, I experienced non'stop UBO all day long.. It was also my kua's nd friend's bday. Stayed outside until 11 pm coz of long'talk time bout our lives. Slept at around 2 am making time pass by making my blog and todo'kdramahan in friendster.         July 18 '04, Sunday        I promised myself I'm going to attend today's seminar because we found out it was really fun! But I had 2 conditions, that is if I'm going to wake up early and if my UBO already flee because of Bisolvon. I thought its impossible for me to wake up! Fortunately, I was awaken by my tremendous coughing at around 6 a.m.! (too early for the mass which was at 8). It was in my mind that I didn't want to go. I just wanted to go back to sleep. And then, Glaiza called me at 7:55 a.m. (5 minutes before the mass). I said I won't go. After I pushed the off button of our cordless phone. I suddenly dialed Glaiza's no. talked to her and hurriedly went to the bathroom. It's like an angel whisphered that I should go! Gosh! My sister was on the bathroom. Still have time to decide wether to attend or not. After almost 20 minutes... I'm already at our school heading my way to the church (even got there earlier than my 3 other friends!). And I just prayed at the mass  "Lord, kayo na po ang bahala sa akin. Sa amin. Thank you po!"      The speaker was really great! I really felt the warmth presence of God. The Holy Spirit surrounding me and lifting my head up. Its as if I was looking at the tremendous light. A light that I can see even if my eyes were close! I don't know if its just because of the tears. But now I know, it really helped me a lot! All those praise and worship songs! Its really great and fun! And of course, because of that seminar, my heart was as light as air. Rising up there in the sky. And that is because of God.    Now, Telu Mi and I are ok. I texted her. I texted my friends "peace be with you". They can't understand what's happening to me. I can't to. But what I surely now is, I'm better. I'm a changed person.. And I love my brand new, improved self.. =)

         My mind is now completely empty. While my heart is completely emotional. And my soul's completely searchin'.. For somethin' that I completely lost.      Home  Thinking back when we first met I remember what you said You said you'd never leave me I let go of your hand Built my castle in the sand But now I'm reachin' out again And I'm not letting go Till you  Hold me Mold me Sometimes I feel so all alone See I gotta find my way back home So why don't you Shape me Make me Wash me whiter than the snow I gotta find my way Back home  Master upon my knees I pray I just want to be the clay Put your arms around me Place my life in your hands Lord I know I'm just a man I know you understand This time I'm not letting go Till you  Anoint me Appoint me Sometimes I feel so all alone See I gotta find my way back home So why don't you Chastise me Baptize me Wash me whiter than the snow I gotta find my way  'Cause I'm lost and alone I've been wandering Long enough to know Humbly I search for you And I'm not gonna rest till you  Choose me Use me Sometimes I feel so all alone I'm on my way back home So why don't you Direct me Bless me Wash me whiter than the snow I'm on my way Back home    Well maybe I know the way back. Back into your arms where I can feel your tight hugs. I really want to. 100% of me positively wants to be with you again. But then again, why should I? You seem to be so contented and happier on where you are right now. Wherever or whatever that is, it has nothin' to do with me. Maybe this is for the better. Or maybe not. Still can't fully decide what to do. Only single act is roaming on my mind. And that is to stay where I am. Lips closed. Eyes wide open. And thoughts wandering everywhere. Everywhere near a pen, a keyboard, or simply here in my blog. I'm lost without you. So can you just please lead my way back home?? Or do I still have a home? A nook somewhere inside you.. somewhere inside your heart..

       AMEL LARRIEUX   Darling I want you to listen I stayed up all night, so I can get this thing right And I don't think there's anything missing Cause a person like you, made it easy to do I've waited for so long, to sing to you this song  Cause your eyes are the windows to heaven Your smile could heal a million souls Your love completes my existence You're the other half that makes me whole You're the only other half that makes me whole  I think the angels are your brothers, yeah They told you about me, said you're just what she needs And I find myself thanking your mother For giving birth to a saint My spirit flies when I say your name If there's one thing that's true It's that I was born to love you  Cause your eyes are the windows to heaven Your smile could heal a million souls Your love completes my existence You're the other half that makes me whole You're the only other half that makes me whole  You make my dreams Come true over and, over again And I honestly truly believe You and me are written in the stars I live my whole life through To giving thanks to you  Cause your eyes are the windows to heaven Your smile could heal a million souls Your love completes my existence You're the other half that makes me whole You're the only other half that makes me whole     miss YoU... How I wish I could sing this to you..

         "Heart over Mind or Mind over Heart?!?! I think Heart over Mind ka Mary!"  -jacqui pasco      Whhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaattttttttttttttttttt????????? Me?!?! A "Heart over Mind" person?! Yeah right! Well jacqui (if you're still reading my posts) if I REALLY am one, Tel and I could've friends again now.. (Well, answered Candymag Quiz and results were really the former. Still, I can't believe it!!!!!!!)  Well, thanks to your Physics book! Texted you   tnx sa buk!   you replied   Wlcme  . My god! You texted in the simplest way you can. I bet you kept editing that until it came out in an as-if-you-dont-even-care manner. Might as well erase the e. Besides, its just a silent letter. But I've known you so much already. Huh! Or do I???  Well, that made me feel even colder. Thanks to you! Already made a final decision. (Just wish I can really do that!)  FORGET YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    First steps to forget you:   1.  Stop doodling your name at the back of my notebook, 1/4, 1/2 crosswise and lengthwise and 1 whole sheet of pad paper.  (WE MUST SAVE TREES!!! I am a Rotarian. Remember that!)   2.  Stop being distracted when someone mentions your name.  (JACQUI!!! Can you please help me by not being a... BITCH?!! haha.. jus jokin')   3.  Stop daydreaming of you.  (Can't evaluate well on my math calculations!!!)   4.  Put all memorabilia  e.g. pictures, letters, pictures, and more pictures!  away on the darkest side of my room where I can't be tempted to reminisce, etc. (tried that already but I eventually placed them back again!!! BITCHY ME!!!)   >>> Or then again... Maybe I shan't try to forget YOU?

        "6,8,12"    Ooh, ooh Do you ever think about me? Do you ever cry yourself to sleep? In the middle of the night when you're awake, Are you calling out for me? Do you ever reminisce? I can't believe in nothing like this I know it's crazy How I still can feel your kiss  [1] - It's been six months, eight days, twelve hours Since you went away I miss you so much and I don't know what to say I should be over you I should know better but it's just not the case  It's been six months, eight days, twelve hours Since you went away  Do you ever ask about me? Do your friends still tell you what to do? Every time the phone rings, Do you wish it was me calling you? Do you still feel the same? Or has time put out the flame? I miss you Is everything okay?  [Repeat 1]  It's hard enough just passing the time When I can't seem to get you off my mind And where is the good in goodbye? Tell me why, tell me why  [Repeat 1]  Sing it for me Ooh, ooh

         While listening to this song, I shall think of you.     Here I am, thinking of you. Can't concentrate on my thoughts. So many words that want to be typed. But I just can't seem to arrange them in a unique manner. As I read 'Friendship on the Rock' before, I was never been so happy. I felt so loved when you gave me the scrap book. I never thought a lazy, walang-paki-sa-grades person could write such a wonderful masterpiece. You're even better than me! And then again, I guess you could use a copyreader.  Yeah, you're absolutely right. Our friendship was really on the rocks! WAS. That is. That we have to part our ways and start our own lives. How did you know??? That was like 3 months ago when you wrote that! Maybe from experience. Coz as far as I know you're always like that. Leaving your "FRIENDS?!?!" behind. I always say that to you. That someday I'll also be one of your LIMOT NA friends. The kind that you said you'll never leave but then again did. Yet, I wasn't prepared. Even though I surely know this will come. I always thought of such situations. Dreamt that we're in a huge fight and there's absolutely no way out. I'd cry for nights just with the mere thoughts. But then again, I'll be happy. Coz we're not apart.  Now, its not a dream. I'm not on a hazy cloud anymore. For all I was scared of was surely happening.  Its been weeks since I last browsed our scrap book and read your letters. For its just hurting me more to see them. Taking a ride back to all the happy and hideous days. I can't even believe we all surpassed those. But reminiscing all your promises is what I can't bear. And still hope it will come true. It's only even now that I know the meaning of 'cynicism'. Silly me..  Well yeah. I surely hope all these trouble we'll fight once again. But things are different. Before, the problem was other people. The people surrounding us. Its easier to fight for we're together. Now, we'll have to do it the other way.. on our own..    >>>Bought a gift for you, hope you'll like it!!! It must've been a thought-of-us-together gift but then again, I got coward... love yah.. {think I'm gonna be this way forever.. talking to you using the net, can't use friendster to express my thoughts anymore, found out you've been reading bulletins! BULLSHIT! thanks to blogger... =)}

       By Kambal Telu Mi      I suppose I'm not really asking much out of life, I have stopped searching for one, big, tremendous, earthshaking event to happen to me. Maybe, I've stopped believing that things can last forever...     I don't know if it's cynicism. I don't think so. It's just that I know people have to change and they have to live lives and they have to go away.  We have to grow old and it's very sad. Well, maybe, one can still remain young, somewhere in the hidden corner of his heart. I don't really know...  All I'm asking is to have experienced having a FRIEND at one time or another. If I have been able to experience that person is my friend, then that is enough for me...  We don't have to see each other everyday because I know that that's not important. We have been a part of each other and no one can take that away from us. That part of each other we shall always keep in our hearts and it will never die. Maybe it will just be pushed at the back of our minds, at times when we have to think about the things occurring at our daily lives. If we want to remember, it will always there to recall, to treasure, and to cherish. Well, I guess that's what last forever.  If I've truly loved you and given you something of myself, then that is enough for me. If I never see you again, nothing will be changed because you already made your place somewhere in my heart and will always be there no matter what.  It makes me sad to think that we had part, then I shall remember the happiness that we once shared and I shall not be sorry. Perhaps, not seeing each other everyday will prevent us from doing things we'd like to do together and knowing everything about each other but I will only have to think that for a magic moment in time we shared something. And that something seemed like everything. Our being apart now doesn't make it less special. Time and distance have no power over what we once shared.  Every time I want to be young again, I shall think of our times. I shall laugh again as I laughed then. We may grow old, but that special thing will always remain fresh and young.  I don't ask much. A moment in time is enough for me to be happy. For I never did care how long, only how much that even for a while can last a lifetime.  If someday we meet, after all these and the magic is not there, it will make me sad. But then, I don't have the right to judge why it has to become different. We both have to change and to grow and if we're both happy this way, then I shall be contented.  But for now, we have to go our ways, somewhere along; the road has to branch out. I take my path and you take yours but shall be happy thinking that once, our roads did cross, and we walked together.

          What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.      uhm.. nothing much to say now. I saw you AGAIN. Of course, you always visit on Thursdays. Yet I dont know why you're always there. Kinda feeling jealous to the one you're up to. Whatever!!!!!!  How I wish a friend is really a single soul dwelling in two bodies. Yeah right.. Every time i see you my soul just makes me want you more.. Now, everything's just sooo damn different! haay.. what a life!!! Not in the mood to dwell on my feelings.. After an exhausting day, seeing you on your new white dress, sinking into sentimental music which songs are all dedicated to you.... I think I can't handle one more dramatic thought..  humm..  "Absence makes MY heart grow FONDER"  WHATEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!

          Here I am again, typing my thoughts. Making evidences of what I am truly feeling. Just wanted to sing.. "All those sleepless nights.. All the tears I've cried.. All the pain I kept inside.. I kept asking myself why, you had 2 say goodbye..". Only the thought was somehow different.     I'm so sad. My feelings full of anger. Anger to myself. Why did we have to come up to this point? After times of pure joy, here I am stressed and worked out. I can't believe everything will just end this way. It didn't come with a notice. I thought everything was just fine. "All is fair in love and war". Nah.. One would suffer more.. The other would just be lonesome as she can. But what can I do?? My heart and mind seems to concur. They are now both shouting to let go.. But somehow, there's a small voice within hoping we'll get back. Not even sooner. Even if it takes a hundred years, it will still wait. I don't know where it came from. But I, myself, am still longing for you..  Every time I had a glance at your face I feel the pain. Not the kind I felt before. The one when you broke my trust. Now, I feel the pain of not having you back. I just wanted to hug you but I can't. To touch your warm presence and embrace your glorious love. Coward as I can say. Afraid of so many things. We have been through many storms, but this time its different.  Do you still feel the pain? How bout the love? Are you even thinking bout me? Missing me like crazy?? My pride is on the top of its lungs. My ego is like on the pedestal it wont take even a little step back. I don't know. Its just not the same as before. I'm not the same when I met you. And I miss the soul that I was. This fucking life.. I'm just sooo damn stupid..  I'm still hoping this won't be the end. I don't know if I'm geared again to fight. But I sure hope I am. I can't promise you anything. My heart's still in pain. I wish you could just come and heal it up.. like you always did.. =(

       Why must there be joy if there soon comes sadness?? Why must there be love  if  anger will fill yourself?? Why must there be laughters if there would be tears?? Why must there be thoughts if those are not real??  I know were not the same but I still keep on hoping That there would be healing for this pain that I'm feeling  Do you still need me? Or not?? Do you still want me to stay?? If I'm just a burden.. Maybe I should just go away  Why am I like this?? I, myself, don't know why.. This feeling of emptiness This feeling I hide  Useless, invisible, I'm gone like a wind.. Well, I'm ashame of this feeling This non'sense of my being I wish I'm the air, your reason of breathing  I know its not important But why do I cry?? Why am I empty?? Your hard as a lie!  So, why do my thoughts just stay at my mind?? Why can't I tell you what I'm feeling inside?? What must I do?? If it doesn't matter to you! Do you really still need me?? Or all these aren't real????

       Pablo Neruda   Tonight I can write the saddest lines.  Write, for example, "The night is shattered and the blue stars shiver in the distance."  The night wind revolves in the sky and sings. Tonight I can write the saddest lines.  I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.  Through nights like this one I held her in my arms. I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.   She loved me, sometimes I loved her too. How could one not have loved her great still eyes.  Tonight I can write the saddest lines.  To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her. To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.  And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture. What does it matter that my love could not keep her.  The night is shattered and she is not with me. This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.  My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her. My sight searches for her as though to go to her. My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.   The same night whitening the same trees. We, of that time, are no longer the same.   I no longer love her, that’s certain, but now I loved her. My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.  Another’s. She will be another’s. Like my kisses before. Her voice. Her bright body. Her infinite eyes.  I no longer love her, that’s certain, but maybe I love her. Love is so short, forgetting is so long.  Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.  Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer and these the last verses that I write for her.

                        "The rain may be falling hard outside, But your smile makes it all alright. I'm so glad that you're my friend. I know our friendship will never end."                  Hey! Wala lang! As usual, you, once again, made me smile. Haha. It's not laughter.. but a smile that touches my heart. Just really had great time last night! Though, our conversation is quite short, I'm still happy coz I saw you even just for a moment. I'm really happy!!! Very much! Hahaha.  Well, everyhting seems to be perfect and normal right now. Just like the old times, old conversations and old days. The only difference is the 4 of us seems to be very busy. Or maybe its just me who's very busy?!?! But what I surely know, even If one of us is missing, and the others are having fun, that one person will surely not be left alone. For in our hearts we're always together..     These are the times I hate the most. Times were silence fills the atmosphere. And all I can think of is our days. I read once again our scrap book, and of course tears fell from my eyes. I miss cm, ahbi, aly, you, the whole gang. What I miss the most is the December season, where cm and me walks after the simbang gabi. December 13, '03- when we went to the mall and you gave me pompoms. Grabe! That must be my happiest moment with all of you! Those times when laughters filled our souls. Well, tama na ang kdramahan.. As you've said "baka dalawin na tau sa mental nyan!". Humm.. This is enough. All I really wanted to say is, "Thank You!" And there's absolutely nothin g to wish for..

						      EVER WONDER POEM   Ever wonder how much pain love brings?     How much joy it will give you and bring you to heaven?     Ever wonder how sweet the chocolate even if it's already melted?     Ever wonder what's with the heart that makes it beat?     Ever wonder what's with love that drive us crazy?     Ever wonder if the two bird in the wedding really love each other that couples like two of them kissed?     Ever wonder having a child in your womb and taking care of it for 9 months?     Ever wonder how difficult it is to be drowned in a pool?     To see that there's no one who cares?     Ever wonder why I write this stupid question?     Ever wonder what hurts most is to write nowhere....think nowhere....be crazy typing this than think normal?     Ever wonder it's time to sleep?      Ever wonder this........how fucking love is?   Maybe?
