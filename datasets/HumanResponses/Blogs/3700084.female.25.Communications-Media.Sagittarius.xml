       Here I am gorging on chicken wings while I type with one hand. But Yummy those wings are goooooooooood.  I woke up around 10:00 am. I got my 8 hours sleep but I have no idea why I'm still tired. Could it be depression or is that that I'm not sleeping that deep sleep especially when I'm PMSing now? I'm clueless. It's nothing new though. I've been suffering from this for years. I even have dark circles under my eyes for as long as I can remember. Maybe I'm amemic. That's probably the reason. All I need is stabilty in my lifestyle. A routine of some sort that from time to time, I'd get out of to spice up my life. At the moment, I have night time classes that make me feel uptight for some reason. I never really liked them. I'm hoping that soon though that I'll start my internship and then I'd have a rountine then. Sleeping a certain time and waking up again a certain time for a while. Another thing that's been bothering me is that I'm PMSing. A girl's nightmare along with the actualy menstral. My whole body just messes up and doesn't want to make me rest. My mood suffers to the degree I'd be ready to snap somebody's neck.   It's Funny how one little thing can change a mood. As I was typing this my doorbell rang. I had no clue who could it be. I looked through the peep hole and to my surprise it was the mail man. I got sooooooo damn excited. I was waiting for this moment for a while. I finally got the package my dad sent me, at least one of them. I believe there's another one on the way. I know I might be a sap for wanting to watch this but the package was a couple of VCD for SuperStar ( The Arabic version of American Idol)  Well, I used to watch it with my family when I was back and as a singer myself, it's a good thing to watch to get a good idea how to be even a better singer. Where I am right now, the show doesn't run and it's totally sad because I miss it, especially that one of the contestants looks like somebody that's sooooo close to my heart but yet far from me on the other side of the world.  Well, I'm watching it while typing this. Anyways, I'm done with this, I'm going to go off watching it on my couch now. YIPPIE!!!!

       So here I am writing on here for the first time so I'm pretty excited. As soon as I finished registering and am getting ready to start. I decided to turn on my lights because it's getting dark and I personally don't like to be in the dark. I even have a night light when I go to bed. Anyways, back the original story... So I turn on the lights and sat on my desk to start on this when I saw the lights flickering, I heard the electricity and the worse thing is I saw sparks from the fuse box. I almost had a heart attack. It's just funny that my cats ran to see what the heck were those sparks. Thank Goodness the fuse box is high up where they can't reach it. Anyways, I just had a heart attack thinking that my place was going to burn down. I'm glad all is fine now though... What a way to start this blogger. :)
