      Hiya, my name is Misty. I'm 16 years old, I'm in 11th grade, I live in Washington state and I go to Inglemoor High School. I guess I should talk about my hobbies...hmmm...well, where should I start. I love to cartoon and work on my Cat Shack comic, play basketball, and hang out with my friends. Hmm......I supose I should be telling you all about how perfect my life is and how great and peachy everything is but then I would be lying. Dont get me wrong, I have a great life, I have wonderfull friends, a great boyfriend, I'm blond, thin and have great parents who are there for me. But, I guess I could be happier. Ok, enough of this depressing shit. I'm getting sick of it. So, ya. Sometimes I wish life could be like how it was in elementary school. No, I'm not talking about how much I wish that I could eat paste still or anything, not that I ate paste or anything....., but I wish that you could hang out with guys like you could when you were in elementary school. Back then you could hang out with boys and play tag with out having dirty minds and thinking about the wrong things all the time. You know? It just seemed so perfect back then. I also miss how innocenct everyone was and how perfect it was. Like in 8th grade at Northshore Junior High I had a friend named Andrew, he was so cool and he was in my Creative Cooking class. We were really good friends and we would always be goofing off in the middle of class and the teacher would always be yelling at us to stop goofing off and to sit down. ^.^ Those were the good ol days. I told my friend Liz how I liked Andrew, and she said she would talk to him for me. I couldn't wait to hear what he would say. She came back to me and told me that she had asked him if he liked me and he had said yes. A million thoughts ran through my head that day. When i would go to the movies with my friends I would ask Andrew if he wanted to hang out also and normally he would say that he ould love to. One time I remember I went with a few friends and him to the movies, when the movie theature in Totem Lake was still open, and we went to go see a movie and it ended up that the movie wasn't playing at the time we went, and so we walked to Pizza Hut across the street and we ate Pizza and chatted and had tons of fun. Then we went back across the street and walked to the stores and my friends went into Denny's Pet Shop and Andrew and I went into the Big 5 sporting shop and we were just talking and laughing. He told me about how much he loved to play tennis and he asked me if i knew how to play. I told him how I wasn't very good at playing tennis and he was like "I should teach you how to play tennis sometime, so you can get better." and I was like "Wow, that would eb really cool." Ok, I know what your thinking, corny right? Well, it wasn't. It was the sweetest thing because by saying that it basicly showed how much we were good friends. It was cool. -.- But ya, then it gets all complicated because after that he came over to my house and my dog Penny had never before seen another guy really come over to the house other then my dad, so she started to growl at hima  little and my mom beat Penny's but for wanting to bite Andrew. So, we played basketball and stuff outside and then he went home. The next day he said that he didn't really want to come over to my house anymore basicly because of how my mom beat my dog.....but remember, if my mom hadn't hit my dog, she could have hurt Andrew....so it was weird after that and one day he gave a necklace to this girl named Danielle, and I kind of got hurt because I was immature and I thought that he liked her more then he liked me and that's when he told me that he had never said that he liked me, even though my friend Liz said that he said he did, and he told me that he never had said that to Liz........ya, what do you expect, I was in 8th grade and very immature.......but anyways, ya, I kinda freaked him out a lil because I got hurt by it and we didn't really talk for a while after that, so we kinda ignored each other for a while.....then I met this guy named Brandon, the worst mistake I could have ever made in my whole life, and talked to him all the time after that. Then, a few days later, Andrew started talking to me again, he actually started to talk and hang out with me again during Cooking Class. I was really happy and confused all at once but it didn't matter to me because by hanging out with Brandon it made Andrew sorta jelous in a way and he started to hang out with me again. So, I would hang out with Brandon more and more to get Andrew to notice me. It seemed like once I started to hangout with Brandon, that a few of the other guys in my classes started to talk to me a lil more and they would ask about why I was going out with Brandon, it was very odd. I didn't really understand it and dont really understand it today but ya I'm getting off topic. Oh and when I would go to dances with Brandon and my friends Andrew would always be looking my way with an expression like why him? Ya, after 8th grade though me and Andrew never really talked to each other, it's kinda sad really............the same still holds today because of how odd it was. I really miss that but it probably will never change....... *sigh* Oh well, I guess. I have to go now, that's probably enough blabbing about that for today. Thanks for listening and if you have anything to say about what I said please feel free to respond because I love to hear from people about stuff it doesn't matter if you even type something that you think was rediculas because most of teh stuff was a lil anyways LOL!!! Well i gtg.   -Misty
