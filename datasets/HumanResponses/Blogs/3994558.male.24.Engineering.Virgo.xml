      The goal of this entry is to highlight the problems relating to the current state of affairs in online dating. Also, I propose a new model for online dating which should resolve most of the problems discussed.     AUTHOR'S BACKGROUND:     I am not, by any stretch of the imagination, an expert on dating. However, I followed with interest this phenomenon since 1998. I am now, and have been for several years, a member of several online dating services. As such, I have insights in both the history and the diversity of the online dating community.    [ODSP: Online Dating Service Provider]     PROBLEM #1: The way ODSPs make money alters users' behaviour     There used to be a time when most everything on the Internet was free. For various reasons beyond the scope of this entry, it is no more. At that time, the classifieds and, as a subsection, personals, were a whole different world.    The problem with online dating pay sites is not about money. I understand that ODSP are there to make a living, must pay for bandwidth, have a staff to maintain the site and usually do a good job. As such, they deserve compensation.  This is not the issue.    The issue is that paying changes the behaviour of online daters. Beyond the somewhat problematic aspect regarding not being able to contact all the people a user is interested in, due to monetary limitations, there is the fact that women do not want to pay for dating in general.    It is usally accepted and recognized that women should not pay while dating, whether on the first few dates or ever, especially if the woman is in the pursuit of a long-term relationship. This behaviour is reflected online by the refusal to buy "credits" / subscription and accepting that men will contact them at their expense.    Back when personals were free, women contacted me after reading my profile. However, with the new pay system (whether pay as you go or flat fee, contacting other member is ALWAYS something you have to pay for) women do not contact me. It is implicit that men will pay to contact them.    It is true that some sites offer free, but very limited, ways of letting another user know that you are interested. These will be discussed later in details.    The fact that you should pay to contact other members limits women in the ability to interact with their selection and exclusively focus on their preferred candidates. The fact that ODSP, whether deliberately or not, do not recognize this truth seriously limits the online dating experience.    (yes, I am aware that this problem would be solved if women all got out their credit cards and decided to pay, but it probably easier to change the system rather than try to change women's habits, as a whole)       PROBLEM #2: There are too many men and not enough women     It has always been like this. It is like this on every site. Regarding online dating, there must be at least 5 men for every woman.    The reasons for this situation are numerous and complicated:         women are afraid of online dating (due to media hype/ urban legends/ horror stories) or do not consider it to be a "romantic" option       women do not understand online dating     women, in general, are less computer oriented and might not use the Internet as frequently       online dating / personals are still, in general, considered "loser" and "last resort" and women don't want to associate with that image        The consequence of this imbalance in representation is that women's attention is solicitated too much and that, correspondingly, it is hard for men to stand out from the crowd. While men are dying of thirst, women are drowning in too much attention... The women are overwhelmed with smiles, hotlists, emails, instant messages and other site-related gimmicks and this situation prevents them from finding the few good guys amidst all the presented candidates.     Beyond making harder for compatible people to match, women often become disillusioned by the experience. They were promised to find their match, and all they were given was a truck-full of willing and ready dating candidates, some less than noble. Bad attitude, developed by this situation or initially present, is discussed next.       PROBLEM #3: Women's attitude towards online dating is bad or they just don't take it seriously.     Some women approach online dating as entertainment. These women are usually bored, serial daters, superficial or just want to see what can come out of it. Others have been overwhelmed by the response, and decide to become hostile or insanely demanding to limit response. Others were "convinced" by someone else to put a profile and are totally uninvolved in the activity. Finally, others are just horrified by the lack of quality of the response or solicitation of an inappropriate nature.    Here are a few "typical" bad attitude red-flag text samples found in bad profiles:         I was bored     I don't think this is going to work     I was dared / convinced by my friends     OK guys, if you don't look like Brad Pitt don't bother     If I read your profile and it doesn't take my breath away, I'm not replying      Online dating can be fun. Also, I believe it to be a great way to meet people and to get a quick idea of what they are about. It is my belief that the experience must be changed to be more woman-friendly.       PROBLEM #4: Unclear online dating procedure     Most ODSP have complicated sites, complicated search options, and complicated layouts. While all those things are good when understood, they generally are not.    Most ODSP do not provide enough information on how their site should be used.    Here's an example of how Lavalife (for example) should be used:         read profiles     smile (indicates interest to other members, FREE) to interesting candidates     if a candidate smiles back then write to the candidate      This should be the way it's done. I like you, you like me, let's talk. However, this is not explained anywhere. In fact, smiles are not understood. Worse, smiles and other free ways to contact are usually considered bad because they hint towards the fact that you do not have enough money to write an email (not FREE). Which might or might not be the case.    Personally, I don't want to write (read: pay) to get your attention when I can smile (read: FREE) to get your attention. Regardless, a look at my profile will tell you if I'm interesting to you or not, I don't need to write for that. It wastes my time and money but that might be the point. (this is  another issue though)    If ODSP provided a better framework to match up members, a lot of frustration could be avoided. The online dating experience should be made as pleasant as possible.       A NEW PROPOSAL FOR ONLINE DATING:     In the following paragraphs, I will describe how an ODSP should organize their site and the whole experience as a whole.    Like before, the first thing required by both men and women is to create a profile. The type of profile already available will do. However, the profile MUST contain at least one picture.     Most sites allow filtering of profiles "with photos only". This is important because "a picture is worth a thousand words". Even if the number of women online is much less than the number of men, that still represents too many profiles to read. As such, "serious" daters should have a picture in their profile and should expect the same from others. Better yet, some sites allow  for multiple pictures and this greatly enhance the selection process.    Only men's profiles are available for browsing / searching, women's profile are only made available upon contact. As a consequence, women must contact the men, men have no way to contact women until first contacted by them. The service is entirely free for women. For men, either a flat-rate monthly or a fee to open messages. Incidentally, the messages could be hidden and the woman's profile reviewed before accepting the fee.    Only being able to browse men's profiles solve 3 problems. First, it greatly diminishes the solicitation of women's attention. Women only contact men they are interested in and are not "bombarded" with requests. Second, because the service is free for women, they can really focus on the candidates that interest them. Finally, the dating procedure becomes clear. Women contact men, contact is free for them and paying for men. Men review messages and  communicate with interesting women.    The site should be divided in sections with regard to intent. For example, Lavalife has 3 sections: "intimate encounter", "dating" and "relationship". HOWEVER, there is a lot of confusion between "dating" and "relationship". Following common sense, dating first, and a relationship follows if dating is right and, consequently, "dating" and "relationship" should become one section. But there could be a "just looking for friends" section created to compensate.    The sections are a good thing because it separates people with totally different intent in parallel, non-touching, universes. No wasting time looking at profiles of people who want a one-night-stand when you are interested in a more serious type of relationship.       CONCLUSIONS AND ISSUES:     This new way to present online dating switches the focus from women to men. It is my belief that this would be a better system because, by its nature, it does reduce or even eliminate the 4 problems discussed above.         the service becomes free for women.     women are not solicitated by the masses.     the experience empowers women and might give them a better opinion of online dating. And because women have to do the work, only serious candidates will bother.     the procedure is simple.      Of course the problems discussed above does not apply to same-sex dating. I am not familiar with these issues in that context and suggests others to voice their opinion on the subject.

      I guess this is the beginning.    I've been feeling like ranting a lot lately.  Lots of things that piss me off which need to come out.  I guess my goal is just to rant a lot.  I might diversify and actually provide useful information / comments.
