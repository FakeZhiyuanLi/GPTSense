      What the hell is wrong with me? I seriously need to get myself fucking checked out cause my mood swings are soooooo randomised. I was in such a good mood today! I made a lovely dinner, I came on here for a cha, ye ok so Andi told me that we gotta postpone again, but that shouldnt set me off. Its just the little things that get right on my tits, like the fact that im stuck here, and it aint gettin any colder. I feel sorry for my friends cause when I let loose I REALLY let loose and I treat everyone like shit. I used to think that I was a nice guy y'know? But look at how many enemies I made, and how many friends I lost in the last year! Its obvious somethings fucking wrong with me. You'd think that after all that I'd treasure my friends, but noooooooo I take them way too much for granted. I even do this to Andi. I come on here and I get annoyed cause he doesnt reply as fast as some. Now what the hell is that!? The guy does have a life besided me! I hate myself right now, and no I wont come back with a fucking post saying "oh wait i love myself" cause i just totally dont right now. I wish that there was something that could just stop me from being a dick all the time, and make me even remotely acceptable to people.

      We've all got fears right? Some big, some small. I'm scared of a number of things, but most of all it's spiders. I'm one A-class arachniphobe. Most people don't understand why I'm so scared of them (cough cough Andi in Return of the King - "It's only a little spider!") But its just absolutely everything about them that I just can't take. I mean they're everywhere, with their eight legs, their sudden jumps and their oh so nasty webs. I haven't told people about this, but I have a re-curring nightmare that I've had for almost two years now. In it, I'm tied to my bed, and a huge black widow just descends on me and starts poking at me. My parents wonder why I'm up a lot at night. It's because Ive been throwing up from the nightmare. Am I just weird? Just I seriously can't go near them. There's one in my livingroom right now, which I found when sorting out the TV. It's like the size of a finger nail, but still I became completely frozen when I saw it. Lucky for me that if I see one whilst in the presence of someone, I can usually supress my fear into a subtle "Oh my God", which is why I may not seem that scared. But everytime I see a spider I feel like my insides are turning themselves inside-out, and now that we've entered summer I'm sooooo scared that Im gonna spaz out at an in-appropriate moment.  I know I might seem a little pathetic here, but hey it's my blog!!

      Yo ma sistas! I cooked the Scottish Banquet for da malasians today, which went off a treat. And they were so great! Who knew that people could laugh that much?? Tis now 5 to 12, and as usual Im listening to music and talking to Andi/Angus. OMG in McDonalds on Tuesday Kris came in, and Jennifer and I were sat right beside him. Luckily I just kinda slid round the the mad central bit out of sight. How awkward! Lol I think Andi's gone in a huff with me because I pointed out rather "enthusiastically" that he was designing prom dresses. Poor lil mite.Im kidding Andi if you're reading this!! Anyways aye. Love me xxx

      Next week Im goin to Andi's house (finally!!). Im so excited, but at the same time slightly worried. The last two times that Andi and I have been "together", there wasn't a lot of intimacy, due to the fact that they were both in the cinema surrounded by a bunch of strangers! So now it's gonna be properly, em, proper. Just me and him. Now I'm not saying for a minute that I don't want to, because I do, and I'm going no matter what. But I'm just concerned that maybe I disapoint him. I haven't been intimate with many guys, and I just wanna show him how much he means to me. But what if I'm not any good? Not to go into the technicalities of what may happen, but there are two things that I'm worried about. One will most likely happen, the other may, or may not. I'm sure you can guess what the latter is. Now Andi hasn't done it either, but he just has this thing about him (which I really admire) which gives him this calm, laid back look at what may, or may not happen. If you are a regular viewer of my blog, then you may have noticed that I don't particuarly like the way I look. Now Andi tells me he thinks I look great, but I just can't see it. And it's vice-versa with him, (though if you saw him you'd know I'm right). So I just wanna look nice for him, which I may be able to do with good hair and a fab outfit (which Ive already decided on - Casually grungy, with white-trend moments). This isn't gonna be two gay guys meeting for casual things that may or may not happen. We both care a lot for each other, and it's gonna be really nice, and intimate. Andi looks out for me, makes sure I'm comfortable with what we may, or may not do. I just know that I'm gonna have untitled in my head the whole time(or even better Andi if it was on!!!) Love me xxx

      Oh my God I came across the best song today. It's called "untitled" and it's by Interpol. I know I seem to harp on about him, but it makes me think of Andi sooooo much! It's so nice, and just em...nice! Anyways. Mums malasian and Indian peeps are coming for dinner tomorrow, so I had to make a hell of a lot of scottish food, which wasn't the most exhilirating experience I can tell you! Next week's gonna be so amazin! No more exams, going to Andi's, getting me new Cons AND I'm going to Paris! Go me!!!! So Im gonna go watch bad girls, will and grace and then I shall chat some more! Tarra for a bit. Love me xxx

      You know what? I am so fucking tired of people treating me like shit for no reason. This has been the case for well over a year now. I don't know what the fuck it is. I'm a nice guy, ye ok so I have my moments when my temper gets the best of me, but so does everyone. So why the hell do so many people dislike me? I mean did I do something to fucking offend them?? Some people don't like the fact that I'm gay, but im not gonna turn into a sad little cunt like Ryan and be all "oh i get so much shit cause of my sexuality". Fuck that. I just wish people would realise that it's the fucking 21st century, and that we ARE here, we ARE queer, so get the fuck used to it. I said I wasn't gonna go into that. Ah well screw it. Im so fucking pissed off today and I have no fucking idea why. Maybe that Im gonna look like a complete spaz by only being able to take three highers. Maybe that I started crying reading another part of Andi's play, despite it not being that emotional. Or maybe it's that once again I feel fucking useless, feeling completely worthless to everyone and that I should just fucking disappear. I hate all those pricks. I hate myself. And I am so fucking angry!

      Oh my God I got such a fright today! Andi came on and was all "oh my god state a you" n stuff, sayin how he never liked me n stuff!! Turned out he was pulling my leg, but still I got so upset! Luckily for me though he couldn't stop apologising, so If he's reading this then he's got another thing to "do" to make it up when I go to his house! (Which is now changed to next week). And Ryan! Oh my God I couldn't believe him. His screen name was somethin about horniness, so me being the way I am, told him that the thought of him being horny is icky. He replied with "Oh. Well I think the same of you. Hand-job boy" I was actual stunned! This is the boy who "claims" to have given a bj in a public toilet not two days ago! He's such a fucking fanny!!!! Grrrr him. Well anyways Im gonna go make dinner so I'll mibsy talk again tonight or tomorrow. Love me xxx

      Just thought I'd explain the name. During summer I get natural blonde highlights coming through in my fringe. Now when this happens I get so weird! This seriously isnt a joke. I seem to turn into a complete bin! I start acting ditsy, I get soooo easily distracted and I forget what I was gonna say! My friends all notice it, and for some reason Jennifer and I seem to get closer.......:P. Anyways. Just worried that Andi will find this pure weird and slap me on the spot. So I apologise in advance for next week! Love me xxx

      Ok so Im sitting here, 14:28, and I'm bored cause no peeps are on msn. So I think ill write all about the people in my life. Some are good, one is not. But here we go anyways.  Louise - She's my everything. We started off as chemistry buds in third year, but our friendship grew and now we're best mates. Louise is great, she's so fucking pretty, but she can't see it. It's a shame. We have such a laugh together, usually at other people.  Jennifer - My, em shall we say "Care-free" gal. Lol. She'll probably kill me for that. I completely love Jennifer so, so much. We do have our moments sometimes, but all that aside she's great. I try to look out for her a lot, because again she's so beautiful. But that gets her a lot of un-wanted attention. She's the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, big chested gal that loads of guys treat like a piece of meat. So it sucks. No one hurts ma Jennifer!!! Lol.  Heather -  Mon trés petit ami. Lol. Many, many people have described Heather and I like Jack and Karen. We go around, critisising(?)others, having a laugh, and if we pull a joke, no matter how bad, we do the jack and karen "exhale laugh", then high five. Heather's great!!  Charlotte - What can I say? I have the biggest laugh with Chaz. We seem to find nearly everything funny, even stuff we shouldn't really laugh at (the sexy beasts to name a few). Charlotte and I pretend to fall out a lot just for drama, it's so much fun. Days would be duller without her. (Oh God I sound like a fucking tree hugger!)  Joe - At last! A guy! Lol. Joe and I have known each other for ages, and over that time we've grown pretty close. Even though, sometimes, well actually all the time, we rip the piss out of him, it's only in a light hearted way. Joe does have a tendency to get pissed off easily, but you ust deal with it. Hes ma wee buddy. (I say "wee", he's actually like 6ft 1 and I'm like 5ft 9!)  Emma - It would take too long to write everything about this gal down here. Clifnotes version: Start of third year, Emma and I start hanging out. Best friends till the start of last summer. We kinds grew apart, new friends, text message errors blah blah. So through the start of fourth year we didn't talk that much. But over the last few months we've really started growing close again. Not totally, but I really feel we've become good friends again. It's great!  Daniel, Laurence and Madeleine - Grrr. These peeps were once my best friends, and we done everything together. But then one day, they hear a stupid rumour, and our friendship is over, just like that. They really hurt me a lot, but I'm sooooo over that now. They can go fuck themselves with razor blades!!!  Ryan - There is sooooo much about this boy that I hate. His looks, his clothes, but most of all his attitiude and general personality. The guy thinks that being gay means you automatically go into random sex acts (which btw he sooooo hasn't done) and acting depressed all the time. He used to fancy me, and as an aftershock of that he's tried to start relation/friendships with all of my peeps! Including Andi, which had caused a massive big emotional crap heap a few months back. But all is good now. Ryan is out on the street, Andi say's he only wants me, and now everyone hates Ryan!  Andi - I put this guy last, because I wanna show that this comes from the bottom of my heart( see what I did there??) I completely love this guy. We met over faceparty, and were cyber buddies for a while. We both felt a slight attraction, so we went on a date on valentines day, which involved "fun" things, then because it was so good we went out again the following week. We've grown so close over the months, been through ups and downs (though mostly ups), and now things are really starting to heat up. Although we can't actually go out exclusively, I feel that what we have is just as special. Andi is just amazing. He's funny, intelligent, so loving, so wonderfully weird, very cute and "innocent". I think he's very good looking, but again he just can't see it. Im going to his house on Tuesday (the 18th), and it's gonna be great, because as he put it, "not just cause I'm gonna get some, but because I'll be near him". I can't imagine life without him.  So that's most of the peeps in my life. There's actually plenty more, but these are the most important (apart from Ryan, I dont care about him soooo much. Just wanted to put him in here to illustarte a point). I'll talk again tonight. Love me xxx

      Hey ho peoples!!! Em Ive tried soooo many times to keep a diary, all of which have been big failures! So I thought I'd try this new-fangled thing called the internet, and it seems alright! Lol. Well what can I say about today? My weekends used to be so full of fun, but now since certain *achem* "changes" have taken place, I don't go out much. So today I went looking for lights, had a luuuuuurvly steak dinner (made by moi), then I watched spun, and it's soooo good! So I came on the net, and started talkin to Andi (youll find out more about him soon enough). It was weird, I felt all drunk and happy, but I hadn't had a drop! So anyways. We were talkin, and he told me he's finally had enough with Ryan (again, you'll find out more), so told him off. And then! BIG REVELATIONS PEOPLE! Andi is a common whore! Lol nah he'd hate me for that. Basically he's been seeing a few of us (five actually) but he got rid of four of them, saying he only wants me, which I find so sweet. He says he loves me, and I love him. We're not in love, but we just have really strong feelings for each other. I read all of his post, and he said that he had to keep reminding both him and myself that we cant go out exclusively right now( we're both kinda busy). I respect that. It's sometimes hard, but I find comfort in the fact that he genuinely wants me. Its great! Anyways Ive ranted on for long enough now. Goin to Andi's house on Tuesday so were talkin about that. Talk soon. Love me xxx

      This is how I was feeling earlier today.....  Oh My God I had the BEST day with Emma!!!! We decided that we'd go into town for coffee (yeah like THAT would actually happen) and it was just great! We were in burger king for aaaaaages just catchin up n stuff which was great fun, then we went wanders for ages! Prince's square - went to the basement and then got lost!! And on the way up Buchannan street (for like the eighth time!) we were stopped by the fucking weirdo gouranga guy with the weird yellow rash! Felt kinda bad though cause we were both doin so well, and then as soon as he announced that there was chanting monks on the CD I pure burst out laughin in his face, with Emma following en suit. Aw wee shame for da man. So then back in E.K traversed to Emma's for a tad to see her folks and bro cause I aint spoken to them in ages!!! So yeah twas great!!!!

      Neddy introduction.............. xxHeyho peepoz!!xx Lol, ok that was a bad attempt. Hey there! So what's been goin on? What is going on? And what will go on? Today on Homo.....  Well what a busy cunt I've been! Thursday we went on a trip to the Edinburgh barracks for the big army trip open day Extravaganza!!!! 'Twas alright, we broke down on the way there, got there, it pissed it down, we ate, talked to hot army men who think they're funny (and actually they were rather), watched the mad demonstration thing with bikes and tanks. All good. BUT! The 40 of us had to share the bus with like 8 guys from Belshill Academy. I swear to God they were the most fucking rude and horribly racist guys I've ever met. They were making a hell of a lot of fun of the rejects (which granted, we do everyday but never to their faces, and we also never go as far as to call wee Tony, a retarded kid from 2nd year "gremlin") and then they turned on this girl in 3rd year. Now at first we hadnt heard them, but we started picking up on what they were saying to her. Stuff like "Dirty black bitch", "Boo" and occasionally saying stuff like "Where's my white hood?" I felt like fuckin deckin them, but of course I wouldn't 'cause I'd get the crap beaten out of me. But it was all good 'cause as they started to leave we all chucked bottles and done a MASSIVE cheer. Felt great!  So then Thurday night was the school show, cleverly titled "This isnae broadway!". I have gotta say it was reeeeeally good. A talent show, but with a script, and with a hint of a Glaswegian twist. Some of it waspure class. There was this little girl from 2nd year (I think) singing and her voice was just amazing. Throw in some proper Glesga Banter, dancing, singing, acting, and an arse dressed up in Old mens clothes and you've got a show! I of course was looking FABULOUS! Lol. But the weirdest thing! Madeleine's boyfriend Adam, whom I've never formally met, kept staring at me! At first I thought I was just being paranoid, but Jennifer and Joe said they had noticed it too! It wasn't like a glare or anything, just looking......How rather odd.  Anyways moving on. Tonight is the big eviction in Big Bro! I swear to God if Dan leaves ill cry! He's great, and Vanessa's just a bint! Plus poor Emma! Locked in the bedsit, AGAIN! She didn't even do anything for fuck sake! Bastards!  Well I'm gonna sign off now. I think Andi's out with David and so won't be on, and Angus has like disappeared off the face of the fucking planet! I say that, and he'll probably come on in like the next five minutes! Trust me....  Love me xxx P.S I really gotta get more peeps readin this cause I never have enough comments. Cheers to those who do, as in Joe and Andi. Lol.

      Hey YALL! Wanna hear somethin funny!? You'll be pissin yourself I tell thee! Well when I came home, I went on Andi's blog, as I do everyday when I get home. On today's post, theres a little warning at the start sayin how I'll be upset if I read on. Now come on chaps and chappettes! Like that's gonna make me NOT wanna read on!? So read on I do. Andi pulled the guy David that he likes, as I was sure he would and so no surprises there. He also subtly mentioned the name "Aaron", which I dismissed. So ye I'm jealous and over-whelmed, but good! And then....lol here comes the funny part! I decided I'd go on Kris's livejournal, just to see what the blonde cunt has been doin with himself. So im reading HIS post, and he talks about going to the catty, with his friend Aaron, and his friend David! Now here Im like "wow this is quite a coincidence!" and I should probably let it be. But me, being the curious cunt that I am thought "Lets investigate angels!" So I took the link to this Aaron's journal, and what do you know! On his friends list of journals, theres a new post entitled "David and............ANDREW!" Reading into this I find that it was indeed my Andi canoodling with the friend of a cunt I dislike. Isnt the world waaaaaaaaay too small!? Oh the hilarity!  But wait! It gets BETTER! Davis post is all "best night of my life" and Andi agrees! On Davids livejournal, Aaron has commented "you're gonna get sexed!" and below, is a comment from Andi, saying how Aaron may not be wrong!   AND my fone is semi-broken! To quote the great Billy Conolly - "Isn't life just a fucking bowl of cherries?"

      Over the past year, Charlotte, Heather and I have come to know and love several, shall we say "special" members of the East Kilbride community. Here's a few of our friends:-  1. The Sexy Beasts Our favourite clan of retards. Discovered almost a year ago, and have grown and expanded since. We have, Mhari senior, with an un-quenchable thirst for life, and lard; Jenni-B senior, a personality and mouth as crooked as her hand; "(haeh)", who parades around in sun-glasses, which cover most of his small head; Wig-woman, woman, with a wig; The reject, who wandered around behind the sexy's, hoping to be accepted, and finally was in March; and the newest member, Cellulite Sally, a.k.a Regina-Pie Mc'eats-a-lot. What a crew.  2.Exorcist lady This horror has been plaguing our dreams for quite some time. With an extremely striking resemblance to the posessed girl from the exorcist, except she is, we think, about 65. She wanders the centre in her water-proof, banged up shoes and hair clasp, searching for a place to have coffee. Her gaze paralyses you on the spot with a mixture of terror and hilarity. God bless her and her coin purse.  3.Muttering Martha A recent addition to the troops, muttering Martha travels from mall to mall, in lively conversation with herself. Much is un-known about this troop, except that her favourite colour is tangerine, and that she dislikes eggs.  4.No-sideburns guy A wannabe sexy beast. Rejected from the gang, he spends his days aiding in the town's busy bus station. A poor fellow, with no side facial hair, and a dark blue fleece which has seen better days. Poor guy.  5.Gurt Friends, and Ross must dance with the over-weight ginger girl. East Kilbride is home to the real one. Standing tall at approximately 6"3, her long tangly hair, freckles and oh so large glasses give Gurt an almost giantess appearence. She is known to appear with a long grey skirt, met with knees the size of grape-fruits and kankles. A rare sight.  Last but not least.... 6. Goofenetta VonCockling  Our favourite resident slash. This he/she has been spotted on several occasions. As yet, we are un-sure as to whether this is a man in his probational year as a "woman" before having sex change surgery, or if he is just very effeminate. Or if it's vice versa, as the sex is actually un-certain. Long flowing blonde hair, owl spectacles and black, scaffy clothes, a fine example of our citizens.  God bless all the troops, and their cotton socks.

      Yall recently Ive been getting in to a new type of music. I'm into all except metal, but over the last few days I've found myself downloading songs that I wouldn't have before. And would you believe.......................................they're love ballads! I mean what the fuck is that about!? Tonight I''ve d/l'd "All by myself" by Eric Carmen, "Without you" by Harry Nillson and "Who's gonna drive you home" by the cars!! Talk about depressing!!! Its crazyness. And speaking of crazyness.......IM IN FIFTH YEAR! There's so much! Fucking Band 1's, RPR's and extended essays! And all the while I'm like "aye". It's so different! BUT! I think I'm doin alright so far. I've decided to do "Dangerous Liasons" for my RPR, so that should be fun. Anyhoo..........Tarra for a bit kid! Love me xxx

      Today I officially started fifth year. I just thought I'd say a few words about it - FUCK SHIT BASTARD BALLS TITS ARSE FAAAAANY! I can't believe I'm actually gonna put myself through it. The sheer pressure that was laid upon us today made me feel physically sick. Mrs bloody Hayburn standing there telling us that there's no more games, it's the real thing. Now I know that this year is meant to be hard, and I accept that. But it isn't helped with all the new rules and shit. For instance, we are now expected to have a 95% attendance rate, or else letters are sent home. I get headaches nearly every day, and a migraine headache usually once a week. I've never been able to force myself into school when I've had one of these, and I don't this year will be any different. What's more is uniform! Apparently if we are caught without full uniform we're actually sent home! Now I'm a good student and I do as well as I can, but I'm not the best. After October 5th (my birthday) they'll be able to throw me out if I don't perform well enough. Looks like this lil camper is going home :(. Love me xxx

      Today I officially started fifth year. I just thought I'd say a few words about it - FUCK SHIT BASTARD BALLS TITS ARSE FAAAAANY! I can't believe I'm actually gonna put myself through it. The sheer pressure that was laid upon us today made me feel physically sick. Mrs bloody Hayburn standing there telling us that there's no more games, it's the real thing. Now I know that this year is meant to be hard, and I accept that. But it isn't helped with all the new rules and shit. For instance, we are now expected to have a 95% attendance rate, or else letters are sent home. I get headaches nearly every day, and a migraine headache usually once a week. I've never been able to force myself into school when I've had one of these, and I don't this year will be any different. What's more is uniform! Apparently if we are caught without full uniform we're actually sent home! Now I'm a good student and I do as well as I can, but I'm not the best. After October 5th (my birthday) they'll be able to throw me out if I don't perform well enough. Looks like this lil camper is going home :(. Love me xxx

      Hey hey! I was in town for the first time in 3 months today!! Twas great. Just me 'n Louise. What a larff. We mucked around for rather a long time and then went to see the prisoner of azkaban which is just CLASS!!!! I saw Kris (I spit on his name!!) and I wanted to see Andi cause he was in too but I didn't :(. So blah blah, good day, we met monica and Laura on the way of home (Monica is the NICEST and most up-beat girl you'll ever meet) and so we were chattin, and she's taking travel and tourism! So I won't be a complete Nigel. But OMG on the train right there were these Neds up the back and I was totally shittin myself cause two of them were completely out of their faces and hte girl kept goin "I'm so fuckin steamin" in that real Neddy tone and I was soooo scared that she was gonna come kill me! Lol. But luckily the bastards got off one stop after central (Crossmyloof of all places!) and so twasn't that bad. So we were walkin home, had to do a MASSIVE pee at home. And now Im here all by myself because the rents and bro are away to troon for the night and because SOMEBODY didn't seize the chance to come over! Lol. Love me xxx  (P.S to somebody - Im only kidding!)

      OMG!!! Madeleine and I have made up!! She texted me earlier sayin that she was sorry, and we were chatting n stuff! Im so happy! Ive spent seven months without her, and to be honest I secretly did miss her even though I wasn't liking her too much. But it's all good now! Andi can't come on Saturday cause he's going partying tomorrow (silly rabbit) but it doesn't matter! Cause I am HAPPY! Lol. Quite sad, I know. So what have I done this week? Went to Pizza Hut (cococted a little seasoned coke with charlotte for joe) and saw Trow, which is shoooooite! Did a MASSIVE clean-up today and am now talkin to lil buddy and going on random websites! Oh what fun!!! Love me xxx
