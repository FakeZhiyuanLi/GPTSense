						   We have received word that Hastings 2005 is in the making. This means it is time to prepare the new troops.    October 2005 is not far off, if you consider building and buying swords, armour and tunics. We already use the Vikings steel combat standards as our own and we have done so since 1999 whilst preparing for H2K. If you want more information send us an  urlLink email .

						   This was a reenactment of the Battle of Hastings. On October 14th, 1066 duke William of Normandy defeated Harold Godwinson, then King of England, to become forever immortalized as William the Conqueror, the first Norman King of England. He was crowned on Christmas day 1066. 934 years later an international force of over 1200 men and women, including over 100 horse, took the field before Senlac hill and refought the battle...We were there...     urlLink     Some of the Canadian Norman Expeditionary Force's (CNEF) members (from left to right) Cory James, Some guy from France, Ryan Jones, Kelly Titus, Icelandic standard bearer (yes he is really from Iceland!), Chris Armstrong and Peter Fuller.   urlLink     King Harold and his retinue inspecting the Saxon Line. That was a lot of angry Saxons to charge!   urlLink     Every 5 years the battle is staged at Battle Abby in the town of Battle, England. In October 2005, the CNEF will return to England to win glory for our Duke once more and the fields of Sussex will ring once again with the battle cry "DEUX AIE!"

						   Founded in 1999 Deux Aie! Is a group dedicated to recreating the Norman Milites and Comes of the 11th Century.  We are a living history group so we strive to have our equipment and clothing as authentic as possible and all combat is done with "live steel".  Each member is responsible for their own safety and actions while attending events, weapons practice and shows.   If you want to be a part of the Norman Milites, an Anglo-Saxon Huscarl, or a Viking Hersir please contact us at:  urlLink Deuxaie@aol.com

						   Thanks to Ryan for taking some great pictures of the group, there will be more added when we have some. View pictures after the jump...     Reynauld d'Oustmont    urlLink     Also known as Ryan Jones has been an avid re-enactor for over ten years now and still does multi-period re-creation from Ancient Rome to The French and Indians War. He is the founder and current head of Deux Aie!    Thorgeir the Slaver    urlLink     Paul Dunn has been a member of the SCA and of the XXIst Legion RAPAX for many years. He has now joined the ranks of Dark Age re-enactors as a particularly nasty Viking, with a slight attitude and drinking problem. Lock up your Daughters! No, Really! It is for your own good.    Conrad de Mortain    urlLink     Cory James joined Deux Aie in 1999 in preperation for Hastings 2000. Since then He has also become the signifer of Legio XXI RAPAX. As long as he gets to swing pointy weapons at his friends, Cory is a happy man. When he is not tyring to rape and pillage his neighbours, Conrad de Mortain can be found in the squaller of his castle trying to remember which pile of clothing he left his fiancee under!    Raudebjorn the Red    urlLink     When Raudebjorn's face goes red then watch out he is probably about to smight you! Sometimes found amoung the ranks of the Normans, Raudebjorn causes trouble everywhere he goes, yet he is never seen around Count Reynauld d'Oustmont. Perhaps he is one of the Count's allies?

						    urlLink Museum of the Regiments  is having their Soldiers of the Two Millennia show.  We will be there, will you?   Museum of the Regiments is once again presenting a living, breathing, battling exposition re-enacting 2000 years of military history. From the Roman Empire through Medieval times, to the Age of Chivalry and on to modern day militaria, we will present the realities of the universal soldier through live presentations and music. The day will be filled with marches, drills, live jousting matches, mock battles and interactive vignettes.  Just a toonie ($2) for 2,000 years of thrilling, living history. Don't miss out on the one-of-a-kind event everyone in the family will love!  August 14 & 15 10:30-4:30
