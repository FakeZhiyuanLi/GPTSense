      I just learned about Blogging last night on the news.  I thought it was interesting. I wanted to do it too.  So, here goes.  I am not sure what to put in here.  Today has been a "blah" day.  I'm ready to go home.  The sun is out and it's so nice outside.  It only stays this way for about a month and then it's boiling hot outside and you begin to sweat the second you walk out the door.  That's Texas for ya.  Or Ya'll.  I'm an accountant, and no, I'm not boring.  I just happened to do this, not planned or anything.  I do like my job and I've been here for almost 7 years.  Can you tell that I get bored?  This is the perfect solution for that I guess.  I have three dogs and a part time cat.  My cat, Buddy Lee, has been coming and going lately. I think it's because it's Spring and he's not fixed.  I know, shame on me.  If he would stay home long enough, I'd take him to get fixed.  I've got two Pomeranians and a mut.  I love animals.  I would love to live on a farm someday.  Well, I'm not sure how stupid I sound so I better stop now.

      Jack Nicholson once asked "What if this is as good as it gets?" and I wonder the same thing.  It seems that we're always striving to be smarter, skinnier, funnier, or more popular among our peers.  Am I just going to die trying?  I wonder how much I do for myself and how much I do for others?  My therapist told me, after I unloaded on her about my marriage, that I'm a victim.  I cringed when she said that.  I don't want to be a victim, but I guess I put myself here and if I don't do anything about it, then I am really just a glutton for punishment.  God, it's sad that I'm too lazy or scared to make any advancements towards happiness.  I just take things day by day and nothing changes.  The only thing that makes me happy is my son.  My son also drives me up the wall sometimes, but I'm sure that's normal for a toddler.  At least he doens't know any better which is more than I can say for my husband.    Well, I keep on trying.  I go to the gym, I try and eat right every now and then.  I lay awake at night and think of how great I looked right before I got pregnant.  I had lost about 30 pounds by running and eating right.  I looked so good.  I was wearing a size 4.  Those jeans, which I refuse to throw out are in my closet now.   I look at them and tell myself that I'll wear them again soon.  I wonder where my self control has gone?  I was so good, but now I see a cookie and I fall apart.  If I could just get myself back to where I was.  I was in the "mode".  Nothing could stop me.  Nothing could tempt me either.  Geez, I was so good.  It is harder now becuase I have a son and I can't just go out the door and run anymore.  I bought a running stroller but somehow it's broken and the wheels are flat.  Good excuse, huh?  That thing is a real pain in the ass anyways to run with.     Well, crap, duty calls.  Gotta work.

      I'm back.  I'm also bored.  I have been feeling so numb lately.  I think it's the Effexor.  I just feel blah.  I don't really have any emotions but anger.  That's great for my husband, who I take everything out on.  Things are so great on the homestead.  I'm trying to take things day by day though.  Some kid bit my son this week.  I know which one too.  A little brat with a shaved head.  That little shit.  He's like 6 years old and my son is 16 months.  Talk about a bully.  My poor little man.  If his Gamma knew, she would throw a fit.  Tristen, my son is so clingy right now.  I guess it just goes with his age.  He's a Momma's boy for sure.  That's okay, in a few years he won't want me anymore, he'll want his Daddy to play sports or other "manly" things.   Right now he literally hangs from my shirt while I'm tyring to do stuff.  I'm the only one who can rock him to bed and hold him most of the time.  He's so sweet though.  He's already a little dare-devil. He climbs on everything and gets up on the table.  Every one says he's "all boy".  Well, my stupid contacts are killing me so I'm going to check my insurance to see if I'm elligable to get some more.  Ciao.

      Wow, I really need to blog more often.  It's been a long time.  Well, where to start?  The past two weeks have been very crazy for me.  My life has been flipped upside down and then back around again.  I found out just before Memorial Day that I was pregnant.  My husband and I were very shocked, and then exicted.  My husband swore that it will be a girl.  I thought so too.  I tried to hold off on telling everyone, but within a few days I had told everybody.  I went to the doctor and did all that fun lab work and so far, I was four weeks and everything looked okay.  Four days later I started bleeding.  This didn't happen with my first pregnancy so I freaked out.  I kept on bleeding and I called my OB but he was not there and my old OB was on call for him.  Yuck.  All he said was for me to lay down.  I did that.  I knew though, deep down, that it was over.  My husband told me to quit being so negative but it wasn't that at all.  A woman knows her body and I knew this wasn't right.  The next Tuesday my fears were confirmed.  A miscarriage.  I cried and I cried some more.  I felt that I was to blame.  I felt a relief as horrible as that sounds and then I felt guilt.  I felt a lot of things.  I didn't know that one out of every ten pregnancies ends up in miscarriage.  I'm just glad mine happened so early.  So, me and my husband decided to try again in about 3 months.   At first we weren't sure we were ready for another baby, but after this has happened, I guess it makes you want it more.  I had already had my mind wondering about my little girl and what we would name her.  I thought about what I would decorate her room in and I even came across my old baby clothes and a dress that I wore home from the hospital when I was born.  Every day it gets a little better.  If I sit and think about it, I want to cry again but I know I've got to get over it.  My body has been in shock basically.  All the pregnancy symptoms have gone now and that is another part that makes it hard.  I had actually started to "feel" pregnant.  I have been spending a lot of time with my son and I'm so grateful that I have him and he's healthy.  I love him so much I can harldy stand it.  He's so beautiful and perfect to me.  I really am blessed to have him.     Work... work.  I feel so unappreciated.  I keep telling myself "just wait until our reviews in August"... I can't wait.  I have so much to say.  I am the fastest and most efficient person in this department and I want the title to back that up.  I was promoted to "Senior" accoutant a couple of years ago but my boss's boss shot that down.  Probably becuase they don't want to pay me more.  I've been here for almost 7 years now and I think I deserve it.  I know that everyone is replaceable but I would like to think of myself as an asset to the company.  My husband resigned from his job.  Normally I would be so mad at him but his boss was a scum ball.  This guy owns the company and treats all his employee and customers like shit.  He does this bait and switch thing where he sells them a very expensive door and then installs a cheap one instead.  He takes people's money and doesn't order the product.  He's on credit hold with several vendors.. I knew my husband shouldn't stay there long.  So, now he's trying to get his own business going.  Precision Door and Trim.  I helped him pass out flyers door to door th is past weekend.  He's been getting calls and has a few jobs lined up.  I hope it works out for him, and us.  It's very scary but I see so many people with their own company's and they do very well.  Look at his scum bag boss, he's a crook and has a huge business.  Oh, and he also punched my husband when he came asking for his last paycheck.  We're suing him and taking him to court.  The police came out and seem to be on our side.  They said that this isn't the first time they have delt with Bobby.  They want him out of business and so do I.  Well, I better get some work done.

      Happy Birthday to me.  I am 26 years old today- well, at 6:23pm I will be.  We had a get together for my birthday yesterday at my brother's house.  It felt surreal.  It felt like a dream, it always does when the attention is on me.  I woke up with a sore throat yesterday morning.  I went out with my girlfriends Saturday night and had some fun.  I hate being the fat girl though.  I did the Limbo contest and lost.  My friend Sarah with her big ole' boobies almost won.  She just broke up with her boyfriend a few days ago.  She seemed fine to me though.  She's so skinny and cute, she will have no problem finding a transition guy or two.  So, well, I had my first orgasm in like 2 years ago the other night.  Talk about relief.  It wasn't a great one, but at this point I'll take what I can get.  My husband and I talked seriously about our marriage on Saturday morning and I cried and told him that I can't imagine my life being this way forever.  He said things can change, blah blah blah.  Whatever.  My friends called me today at work to say that I should call Shannon for a booty call.  Lord knows I've played out that scenario a million times.  Right now, I guess I'm just not in the mood.  I'm not up to my full potential today.  I feel kind of sickly and it's Monday.  It's so weird to think about cheating on your spouse and not sense any guilt.  I feel like I deserve to.  That probably sounds horrible.  Like I told Jana, Shannon doesn't count as cheating because I have slept with him before!  Right?  Is that the rule?  Geez, I'm awful.  I wonder what I would tell Tristen if I cheated on his daddy?  How could I explain it so that he didn't hate me?  I'm such a chicken shit though, I'd probably never do anything anyway.  I sit back and think about it.  BUT, if he just happened to be at the same bar as me one night.... Well, we could talk, right?  I am too fat to see him now.  I've got to loose some weight first.  I went to the gym today and ate an Atkins friendly wrap.  I'm determined to get this lard off.  Well, gonna go now.

      I don't blog nearly enough as I should. I got in a fight with my husband last night.  He told me I was bitter like my mom was when she was married to my dad.  So, I said maybe when I'm forty-something I'll find true happiness like her too.  So he said are you happy?  I said no.  He got up, broke the lamp and went to the couch.  I laid there for a while thinking.  I didn't really care to go and get him but I figured I should.  I did because I'm married and you're supposed to do that stuff, right?  Even if you don't give a shit.  So I went in there and told him to come to bed.  He said that I'm weird and one day I'm fine and then I go and say something like that to him.  Then I asked him why he told me I was bitter?  He didn't have an answer.  He thinks that if we ignore our problems, they go away.  We haven't said anything else about last night and I bet you anything he thinks it's all fine again.  Meanwhile, it's another unresolved issue for me.  We went to the lake over the weekend I saw couples loving each other and saying nice things about one another.  I was so jealous and sad.  I don't have that.  Am I supposed to suffer through a marriage like that?  I feel that my husband doesn't want me sexually and I know it's my fault.  I am fat and ugly and don't have anything attractive about me.  I've always blamed myself.  I was thinking yesterday about how much I need passion and that stuff and I figure if he won't let me get a divorce, then he's going to have to let me cheat then.  I can't go on for the rest of my life only having sex once every couple of months.  Maybe that makes me selfish but I can't help it.  I'm only human and I don't think I'm asking that much.  My life is miserable sometimes.   I dreamt of walking around a mall looking for any attractive guy I could find.  I just wanted to have sex with someone, anyone.  I wish Brad weren't in San Diego...

       Jeremiah,   I am writing this to you because it seems any time we try to talk, it turns to an argument and I think I am done with those. I've been doing a lot of thinking lately and I keep coming to the same conclusion. We fight so much and we are both so angry and I worry about the effect it has on our son. I am going to move out. I don't want to argue about anything and I'm willing to listen to any requests you might have about Tristen or anything else. I am so afraid of hurting you, but at the same time- you have been hurting me for so long. Maybe you don't even realize it, or it's a subconscious thing. I keep a lot buried inside and now it's festered up and overflowed. I've never felt so worthless in my life. I know that a lot of this is due to me and all my problems and I need to work on those. I have realized though, that I can only work on these on my own. Time apart will help us realize what we both want from life. There's no way that Tristen would not benefit from this. Right now he has two agitated and angry parents who yell at each other an at him daily. It hurts me to the core to think about what we might be doing to him. I love him more than life itself and that's why this decision is so important. We will always be linked together through Tristen even if we do not live together. I want to be happy, and to find happiness. I cannot find it with you right now. I beg you to understand my decision and to let me do what needs to be done. If I stay, I will only become more bitter and hateful. I can't even stand myself these days. I care for you and your feelings and the last thing I want to do is hurt you or take anything away from you. I promise to never do that with Tristen, but as for myself, I must go and sort out my thoughts. They say if you love someone, let them go.       Love, Shelly

      Omigod, I'm screaming on the inside. I'm ripping and tearing and I want to bust loose so bad. Isn't it horrible to know exactly what you want but don't know how to get it? Screw all this fear! Can't something make this easier? I wish he would hit me. That would be the best thing ever, then I could leave and not feel the guilt. Maybe I should provoke it? What am I saying? Am I nuts?  Every time I read an email from Brad, I smile so big and I can't even make myself stop. This big, goofy ass smile across my face. I started reading "The Notebook" last night and the romance and passion has taken it's toll. I want that. God, do I want that. I want to feel love again. I want someone to want me, right here and right now. I want that kind of urgency. I have to realize that I control my destiny, no one else. What am I going to do? I can't even afford a divorce I think. I don't know. Only if it were uncontested. I bet he would argue over every last detail. He can't stop me from moving out though. Where would I go? To my mom's? That's so far away. Ugh....

      Call me a hopeless romantic, but I think that I'm destined to find my true love out there.  I don't think the one I'm with is that at all.  I've made up my mind.  I don't want to have another baby.  I'm not going to.  What I want is to get a seperation.  I want to start my own life over again.  I want my independance again and I don't ever want to marry again.  I remember getting into fights in the past where when he threatened to leave I would cry and beg for him to stay.  My heart would freeze and hurt but know.... oh no.  When we fight and threats start, I feel relief.  I feel like, is this it?  Will this be the last fight?  Can we get a divorce now?  I'm so afraid.  Not of being alone, not of starting over.  I'm afraid of hurting him and I'm afraid of what I will do to him.  Not one person can say that Tristen would be better off if we stayed married.  We would both be better parents apart.  I just can't do this anymore.  I'm too young to be in this spot.  He'll be home soon and I don't want him to read this blog.  Marriage is so stupid and pointless to me.  Why do you want to tie yourself to one person and have to agree with everything for the rest of your life?  I want to be me again.

        It all started with a dream about a monkey. Thursday night I dreamt that Brad was in town and I met up with him and his friend. We first met up in my room, at my dad's house. My sister was sitting there with me and my dresser fell on us but I got out of the way. My sister's head was bleeding and stuff and I was so mad at the dresser. I took it outside and threw it on the ground and broke it. I remember that I think I had my pajamas on and make up from the day before. Then it went on to a street in Duncanville. I was standing there with Brad and his friend and I kept kissing him. He was a little stand-off-ish. I was watching someone's spider monkey and it kept running and jumping all over the place and I ended up having to put the damn thing in my purse and zipping it up. Brad went home and went to bed and I came there and tried to get him to come back out. It was weird.    I called him on his cell phone on Friday afternoon. He answered but I could tell he was in a car with the windows down. He said he was in a jeep. I could barely hear him but he asked how I was and how Tristen was. I told him that I would call back later when I could hear him better. I went to my softball game after that. Jeremiah went to watch the Tyson fight so after I got Tristen in bed, I snuck outside and called him again. No answer. I left a message. I never heard back. Oh well. I don't know if it's Brad, or the idea that he represents. Something different. Any guy seems perfect when you live with Jeremiah. He basically called me out on Thursday and said that I'm a bad mother. He said I don't watch Tristen good enough and that he only gets hurt when I am watching him. He can make me feel two inches tall and I think he likes it that way. It's wierd because I don't see myself with him for the rest of my life, but I don't know what to do. I'm scared... I'm also torn. One day I want to have another baby and the next I want to get the hell out. He wants to sell our house and build another one. All that does is scare me. I don't want anymore comittments. Then I think, I'm such a looser. How can I encourage Jana, who's pregnant, to leave her man when I'm too chicken shit to do it myself? I guess it's easier for me to tell Jana that but I realize how much harder it is to actually do it. I can convince myself that she'll be okay and better off here but can she do that for herself? I guess if I could snap my fingers and make anything happen, I would have a rent house that Jana and I could live in. We could raise our kids together and be there when times are tough. You don't need a man. You don't  have  to be married. When did it get easier to stay and take the abuse than to leave and set yourself free? What do I tell my husband? You irritate the shit out of me and I want to start seeing other people? Yeah, that would go over real good. He almost hit me again the other day. I didn't change the cat litter so he took the cat and was trying to leave and take her to the pound. I threw a plastic cup at his truck and he came charging back out and forced me into the house and I was sure he would choke me or something. He restrained himself though. I don't need that drama in my life. Not in front of my son either. Woe is me...
