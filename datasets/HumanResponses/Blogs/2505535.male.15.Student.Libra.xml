      Just got home from a gig, it was most fun, but most of the bands sounded the same.. just differed in how well they played their songs.  But I got some Racer X and a cupa tea, so I'm alright. Alot of ppl have spotted me in Beanos, w0o! I am most proud, I must go there to see it myself. Seeing as I'm a *regular* hehe *proud*  I keep going to bed later and later, and waking up later and later, I'm gunna try and get back into routine in the new year.  Morrowind's going well, maybe I should play less of that.. it can't be healthy..... hehe

I haven't checked my mail in a while coz of the whole xmas thing, so best go do that now. Tomorrow I'm gunna get on with playing video games and watching DVDs, got Office Space aswell, that's really good.

      No more school, today the last day of the term was the most pointless yet, got no work done, sat through assemblies, etc.. but got our reports back, mine was alright, some ppl ended up with absolutely shit reports.. hmmm Time for a cup of tea then some warcraft, still got all my christmas shopping to do.

      Ok, first post, hopefully I'll be able to update this quite often. Right now I don't have much to say though, it's the run upto  urlLink christmas  and I haven't done enough xmas shopping.. ah, I'll do it next weekend, and hopefully some in the week when school ends, any other term and it would've by now, but this ones the longest.. grur. Got an easy day tmz; music, economics, RE and Games - piss easy, hehe. Won splinter cell the other day, it was one of those games I started and never finished, but it was most easy. Oh, I got my clarinet grade 5 results back today, a very solid merit, 125 to be exact, 5 off a distinction.... back of the net. Mmmm, SiKth, I've been listening to too much SiKth, I'm gunna go back to some Patton soon, and then maybe create some bad music with Buzz and Goldwave, and add it to my  urlLink collection

      Almost the end of the week, excellent.  Alot of weird stuff in the news recently, tuition fees - that sucks, and the Hutton thingy, shame about Greg Dyke reseigning, ah well, I don't think anyone knows who to trust really.  I saw Freddy Vs Jason last night, it was actually pretty good, but could've been alot better, its understandable how most people thought it to be a failure, but hopefully the AVP Movie won't be a repeat of this.  And it's been snowing, not that you don't know, but it's something to mention, but now it's all slushy, hopefully it'll snow again tonight, or maybe keep snowing through February, doesn't look too likely, but seeing how this recent snow suddenly appeared from no where (to be fair the news/weather did meantion it) our chances of snow have increased.

      Ah man, really full atm, got back from Croydon about 45 mins ago, saw Scary Movie 3, it was really funny, then went to Pizza hut.. there were 15 of us in total, I ate so much, I think the bill for my table (6 of us) came to about Â£40-50 I think.  Ah man.. we musta talked to much bullshit, something about warcraft 2, and stuff, most fun, but now I'm pretty full, re-eating again once I got in wasn't such a great idea, and Elliott was most nice and gave me and Dave a lift home, w0o!  I think my dad's gunna make me and Dave tidy our room tmz, but he hasn't mentioned it since last wed.. so I'm hoping he's forgotten.. it's pretty likely that he has, but he's often quiet about these things anyway.  Oh, and I finished El Goonish Shive, now I can just read the updates, so that's good, I think I need to stay still alot now, and get alot of fluids, lol.

      I've just read a whole load of  urlLink El Goonish Shive  it's a pretty fucked up web comic.. but really funny and a great story line.  I was feeling a lil ill earlier but it went, seems most people arn't too good atm either. But my Primus DVD - Animals should not try to act like people, arrived today, it's really good, all their music vids, live shows, it's proper bo I tell thee.  Got a loooong day tmz, but atleast school's fairly easy. Right... back to El Goonish

      Just got back from SikTh, probably the best gig I've ever been to, I met Mikee before the gig started, he was completely off his face...   "how did u reconise me? I'm in disguise, man" his dreads were sticking out the side of his hoody.. wasn't too convincing...  lol, it was really cool, the gig was being filmed and recorded, and they played Peep Show and Mikee did the whole of "When Will The Forest Speak" Most fun, but now I'm tired and need some sleep

      Already had one week back at school, kinda getting back into the routine, but it's just the effort, but seeing Sikth next week, so that's gunna be cool, and I ordered a Primus DVD "Animals shouldn't act like people" should arrive tomorrow or the day after.  Been playing Praetorians a bit, it's a pretty cool game, but hard, got an English speaking thing on Wednesday, dunno how that's gunna go, I recon I'll do alright, just we were only told today.. hmmm

      Going back to school tomorrow, eek! >.  So I'll try not to waste my last day of the holidays, today I've already watched 3 hour long American TV shows: SG1, Farscape and Angel, it was kinda cool, I'm planning to go play some Mario Kart DD now that Dave's awake. Already got Toad + Toadette, w0o! pwn3d.  Yesterday I ordered tickets to see SiKth, in like 5 places there was only 1 left, took us ages to find a place where there were at least 2, eventually wayahead had some, w0o! damn lucky, I think all tickets are gone now.. or as good as.

      Ok, just got home from a gig, was much better than I thought, went with  urlLink Dave  and  urlLink May  which was cool, we saw Bingo Tonight and Transposed, I was suprised, Bingo had improved alot and sounded really good, if ur reading this any bingo guys (which I doubt) u were pretty damn awesome.. even thought it's not the kinda music I go for.. I'm not a huge fan of Christian Punk - quite a weird/nice concept.  Sam May's dad gave Me and Dave (and Sam obviously) Which was nice of him, his driving is either too fast, or my 'rents are really cautious drivers, lol, I'm guessing the latter.  Saw quite alot of people there though, which rocked the mizzhouse, Charm and Jen decided to take so loads of caffine pills, which meant Charm's arse started to vibrate, apparently is was 9/10 amazing, whatever that means.. Alot of guys from my sixform were there, Ging and Tom where taking alot of photos, the gig was in Wilson's school, why are all schools so much nicer than mine? And apparently "you don't touch a brova's pig tails muffa fukka" but u know I don't have t' pizz- pizz -pizzup wit dat mi brizane.  School this week was really hard, and I've got another 5 weeks of this.. turns out it was 6 weeks till easter, dammit. We got a new English Teacher "Mr. Twohig" and parents evening is next week, which should be interesting...  I wish I had an interesting weekend ahead of me, but I really don't, I'm gunna have to find something to do, or end up trying to be spontanious, and end up going outside to be bored and cold rather than inside bored and cold.. but then again I do need to go out to buy more video games, I'm in short supply. Beyond Good and Evil is supposed to out now, and cheap cas no-one bought it on PS2, so it's cheap on GameCube =D  Why is Russia called Russia.

      Well, that was the half term, and school tomorrow, I'm gunna have to wake up at 7 >.  Also I played some SWKOTOR, which was fun, I just got off the leviathan. So yeh, and my dad's calling me for some my cup of tea, so I'm having to rush. Seeing as I'm gunna have not as much time over the next, 5 (I think) weeks expect updates to be not as frequent but longer in general.. hopefully.   urlLink Oh yeh, and I added 2 more songs to my soundclick, so give them a listen if u have time.

      Nearing the end of the half term. PLAUGH! well, it wasn't wasted, on wednesday there was a Sparrow Family outing, which I attented, to a farm. Deen farm, tiny, free and took 2 hours and 30 mins to get to, and 1/2 an hour to get back, lol, well, back to Croydon. Was most fun =D  Thursday, lazy played alot of Warcraft with Dave (oh man, I'm sounding like  urlLink Jon  and Comand and Conquer) lots of stalemates and wasted time there.  And today.. much the same, but Alex from down the road came round, and we played south park, gauntlet legends and Sonic Shuffle =D most fun.   I haven't been able to get a good lie in all half term, the alarms I use for school somehow got turned back on, and we kept forgetting to turn them off, and this morning my neighbours decided to start putting up shelves first thing in the afternoon which of course meant loud hammering and such like, dammit, only 2 more days of half term.. ye-arr, I wanted to see Ashley tmz in Croydon, but can't.. dahh, hopefully next week I'll be free.

      Last night was Conner's birthday party, it was really good, played alot of Halo, watched Alan Partridge, Bo 'Selecta, Ali G, played more Halo, it was cool.  And today, I went to Croydon with Amy, Ben and Anna, it was cool, I bought, Fantomas - Delerium Cordia (which is really good, I'm listening to it now) and Dream Theatre.. can't remember the name of the album, but the songs are really good.  Alot of people are at the Cartoon, seeing Felix XIII and some other band - so no-one's online, partly why I'm finding the time to update this. Delerium Cordia is suprisingly good, I recomend it.. I think I need something to eat now.. pizza hut wasn't enough, and a cup of tea...

      So that band I saw last night.. ruled! they were actually really really good, very talented, very powerful strong melodies and stuff, saw some ppl there I knew. So that was cool, and I won Shemnue today, and already done one disk of Shemnue 2 which is good.  Me and Dave got a valentine's card today, there was alot of effort put into it, we even suspect it was hand delivered (no address on the letter) and there was a chicken in the middle, and it's beak opened and closed as u opened and closed the card. Most impressive, and it didn't say who it was from, weird... but expected from Valentines cards, lol.  Well, I'm being kicked off the computer right now, by a certain self proclaimed Jammy Bastard, Dave, who at this present moment in time is "doing the worm" on the carpet *roles eyes* Bastard.

      ok, so, that was the last day of school, for a week at least. I think my dad's taking me and Dave to see some band he likes tonight, apparently they're really talented, not what I really listen to, but it should be interesting at least, and he seems to be really eager, but doesn't really want to go alone.  And now I have alot of time to burn, gunna use most of it up on Shemnue and Shemue 2, then maybe some other Dreamcast games. I think I'm gunna by Fantomas's new album (Delirium Cordia? or something along those lines) and also the latest Tomahawk Album - Mit Gas, and if I still have money left.. Sonic Heroes =D and I've got to get Conner a birthday present, have no idea what to get him, I'll prob end up getting him money as requested.

      So, recently I've been remixing one of my older brother's songs, dunno the name, but it's about a Sega Hero Character called Chuck who shoots skulls out his belly? I think I've done quite well with it, just gotta smooth off the edges in Goldwave, then I'm done.  Had the Cross Country on tuesday, that really sucked, 3 miles, 35 mins running, I came 28th though, out of 125 people in my year, *proud*  Shemnue's getting better, gunna have the 70 man battle any day soon. So, "I'm a Celebrity.." ended a few days ago, now who couldn't see that Kerry was gunna win? It's all this follow up stuff on what the celebrities "really" thought about each other that annoys me. Can't they just let the show end. Meh.  And, tomorrow is the last day before the half term! Yay! and it's Conner's birthday thing on monday, so that'll be fun, and I think I'm going out tuesday aswell to Croyon.. wait.. yeh, I am. So that'll be fun. I'm pretty sure I'm meant to be going other places.. but I can't remember right now, I think I'll get a cup of tea then it'll come to me....

      Please disregard the last post...  I started Shemnue today, it's such a magical game, had alot of fun playing it, I think it's for the best, I'll be able to play Shemnue 2 after.. with the same save!! *gasps*  I'm gunna get a nice long lie in tomorrow morning, then play lots of shemnue =D  Just watched "I'm A Celebrity.." quality watching time, I recorn Lord B or Kerry should win, that'd be cool.  No one's online, well, I say no one.. no one I talk to, my toes itch

      So, it's february. I hate French. I really do. It's not funny anymore.  Anyway, got a mufti day this friday, that should be fun, and there was this puzzle day today at school, where they got "gifted" people to do puzzles, none of us were convinced on the choosing of the gifted, i.e. A dumbass like James Bolten goes.. but the genius Hwang doesn't.. and there was alot of other cases like this.. almost no-one was in French. . . .  I've been getting this weird rash/burn thing on my arms recently, where my arms go red, and feel like they're on fire..  I'm a celebrity get me out of here is on! must dash!!!

      Just got back from the wind band concert like 30 mins ago. I am also tired, for this I blame the clocks. I was pleased with the concert thing, I didn't cock up once or get lost =D  I've just gotta somehow manage to drag myself through wednesday, thursday and the friday 1/2 day and I'm home free. I've been listening to alot of faith no more recently. I have a 2000 word essay in for Friday, coursework *sigh*  I don't have any plans for the Easter Holidays, I must make some. I don't have anything else to say, so have a good remainder of week everyone who reads this, oh and I'm in the new SikTh video, the crowd's blurry, but u can catch glimpses of Me, Dave, John and Ben, sweet. Cya fuckers. ^_^

      This weekend was cool.  Friday, Jen, Charm and Charl came round for video games (Sonic Shuffle) and tea. That was fun.  Saturday, had normal theory lesson, end of the term for that, so no more theory for 3 weeks, and also that evening went to Heva's shindig party thing, me and Dave got her lots of poundland goodies for her birthday, there were alot of drunk people, and I wasn't one of them - it was tres tres amusing. Oh, and Charl got me and Dave hair clips, they're white, light pink, pink and all of them fluffy, nice.   Today I met up with Gemma and went up to London, we went to the Science museum and the natural history museum, that was cool. Lots of dinosaurs and sparkly things. I bumped into a few people on the way home randomly, Cassie, James and Nikki. Interesting.  I'm now entering the last week of school until the Easter Holidays.. can't wait. *shakes with excitement* and now to play some Deus Ex 2.

      Hey, I feel I must update, but not too much has happened, so this is partially just to let you know - I'm not dead. Incase a few more days went by with 0 posts.  But yesterday I did meet Helen and Charl after school at the station for a good ol' chat. That was fun, and Dave has had his piano exam and soon to have his flute exam, which with any luck my 'rents shall buy him Splinter Cell 2 for all the hard work.  I'm finding myself in need of more and more money with all these awesome (yes, they're that good, awesome, eyy) games coming out, I plan to get  urlLink Harvest Moon: The Wonderful Life , and also Dave just bought  urlLink Deus Ex 2: The Invisible War , and I plan to buy the essence of Jon's older computer when he comes back, 'coz he's just upgraded his with his birthday money.  Well, that's all from me until sunday (I'm guessing Sunday anyway, I seem to have made a routine of it)

      This weekend was fun, but it passed too quickly, still 2 weeks until the Easter Holidays.  Saturday morning I did 3 and 1/2 hours of Tai Chi, which was fun, then when I got back Charl came round, we played video games and drank tea.  Today, Charl, Jen and Charm came round, that was fun, we watched some  urlLink ATHF  and south park and managed to play some Sonic Shuffle that was most fun. Excellent.  Oh yeh, Monster Magnet are playing here soon, and so are Fantomas, RAWK! =D

      Got a Focus On Fitness day tmz. Yeh, so new layout, I like it.  Ging, Hattie and Prav came round today for 5 mins, but I was asleep, plargh! Tom informed me they were doing Life Drawing or something. Hmm, interesting.  I saw the new urlLink  south park  today, I recomend everyone goes and  urlLink downloads  it, if u have broadband that is, it used bit torrents which is gay, but it works. It's called fun with weapons, but u can see older ones to which haven't been released here yet.  My older brother is 20 today, go  urlLink Jon.   Not much else to report really, oh, the Nintendo DS to have instant messaging, and I started reading another web comic,  urlLink Chugwork Academy

      So, weekend up, eh? Yet again. Well, it's expected seeing as weekends are a continuous thing.  Ok, friday, Charl managed to get herself grounded for the weekend, oh, and she told me so on msn (see, I said I'd mention that) -  so that lead to no-one coming round on sun, which also meant I managed to get further in Zoo Tycoon Complete.   Saturday, had the normal Theory Class and Clarinet lesson, then sometime in the afternoon Helen came round, we played video games and drank tea. I won every game we played *smug grin* but Helen killed me once accidently in Halo by reversing over me in a warthog, that's a jeep for those non-Halo players. Dave was my only competition, but he can't shoot for shit. Heh heh.  Sunday, nothing happened, if u've been paying attention to this post you should know why. I've been following the  urlLink Nintendo DS  quite closely, some really good games should be coming out soon, hopefully. =D

      Last two days haven't just been uneventful, but also incredibly boring, for instance, in a French cover lesson we had to.. wait for it.. count how many words were on the front page's of newspapers then compare that ammount to another newspaper.. Yes, the entire front page, sentence by sentence.. then if we finished that we were allowed to number pages in our books. For Fucks Sake.  But English today was fun, one of my teacher's accidently fired a BB Gun at someone, then tried to convince us it wasn't a BB Gun, just a "light air rifle" *rolls eyes* It's a gun, that shoots BB bullets, therefore a BB gun. Silly English teachers. I tried to get a detective hat for my play in English -  GCSE speaking and listening - drama - but none of the english teachers had one.. but for some reason they all offered me their BB Gun they had around.  Right, that's all from me today, need to play some more Zoo Tycoon Complete!

      Today my sister is 13.     On the plus side this means more cake tonight, I managed to get some yesterday to, excellent.. cake..  And I also had a jamming session, even though there was a lead crisis we managed to get everything together and it all went smoothly, we were loud and funky (plus in tune and in time) Alan offered to fix one of my leads, which was really cool of him. Everyone played really well, fun fun fun.  I have a large range of movies I could watch tonight, my sister got a few DVDs for her birthday, and my mum found a whole load of cheap 2nd hand DVDs when she was shopping, which includes all the batman films! *gasps*

      So, weekend update, eh?  So Friday had a mufti day, much fun. I managed to break a string on my guitar, so I'm gunna replace them all, I think it's still the same set I started with, they so crap and old it's just not funny, luckily I already had a spare set in case of said event.  Saturday, Charl came round and we (inc. Dave obv) had tea, then played video games, then went to the Tate Modern, and met Alice on the way. We spent a silly ammount of time in the mirror-ceiling-light-hall place, it was cool. Then we met Alex Bate randomly in Victoria Station, he'd just had a panic attack, but was recovering when we met him, but he seemed alright, which was good. Then Alice came round afterwards and we listened to the Crazy Gods Of Endless Noise, oh the funk, and drank tea at the same time.  And today was my sister's birthday party - which means 13 13 year old screaming girls running around my house - Me and Dave tried to escape the house, but our attempt failed, no place to go to that we could be arsed to go to. We had to stay in this room all day and play Civ 3, at least I'm king of the world.. I must go, got to see Cruel Intentions, sweet.  *salutes*

      First post of the month, Pinch Punch and all that shite.  My Dad's at my parent's evening right now, hopefully things should run smoothly. I don't have much homework, so as you see, I'm posting on my blog, I wish I had more to report but things are quiet at the moment.. too quiet...  Oh, I suprised myself by managing to play a solo, the one at the beginning of "Minibosses - Wizards and Warriors" but I also managed to get RSI or something, Repeatative Strain Injury, It gave me a sharp pain when I put pressure on my little finger, so no over-practicing for a while..  Oh yeh, my school banned the whole of year 10 (me) from the cantine at my school, for what a few people did (broke some new lockers) it was one of those "u'll all punished till someone owns up" deals, but cos the cantine started to lose money etc.. they had to let us back in today, but on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday I beat the system, by getting my 6th form mates to get me food. Thanks guys.   I think it was an eleborate scheme to get us to buy food elsewhere, seems a convincidence that fair trade week in our school was also that week =P If I owned a shop over the road I'd always just come into the school, give the lockers a good kicking - so everyone gets banned - and everyone would have to get food from me.

There was a mufti day on wednesday which was good, but it's been raining all week, and I now have a sore throat which is hindering my ability to talk and to drink tea. There's a 3 day weekend this weekend - but I'm more focused on a shorter 4 day week next week, and the fact that I get to miss french on monday - And according to that *points up* I'd be a heretic, sounds more cool than any of the others =P

      Yeh, this weekend has been cool so far. Went to Carmen's 18th last night, it was alot of fun, the "tops-off" game made an appearance, so that was fun. There were alot of nice people there, Luke, Jamie, Carmen (obviously), Becca, Suzie, and then I met some more people there who were cool, a bunch of guys and girls I didn't know, but I did talk to a guy named Sam and a girl named Tory... won't go into detail there.  And today I had my music and theory lessons as normal, my clarinet teacher was very impressed by my Lutoslawski, cos it's a grade 7 piece, and I can play it, w0o - that's what "smart practice" can get ya, apparently 8) ...  After that when I got home, Charm, Jen, Kathleen and Charlotte came round, we didn't have any tea, oh well, but we did hang out at the back of my garden talking and such. That was cool, and I still have sunday, for which I have no plans. I don't think it's *too* late to organise something, just can't really be arsed, it is my day of rest. ye-arr *pirate noise*ye-arr

      I haven't done that much this week. Went to a gig at the cartoon, Teenage Diaries have improved alot since I last saw them, I was most impressed.  Yesterday was fun, went on a picnic thing in Beddington Park with Sara, Becca, Amy, someone who I can't remember their name cos I only met them that day, George (who I'm still not convinced actually exists, and also only met that day) Tom and Dave, we played poo sticks with cookies.  But after that we went back to Someone's for a party, it was excellent, lots of people were there, we played the "Tops Off Game" which involved chanting, and everyone with their tops off - as the name suggests. Also I don't recomend mixing tea with alcohol, both are nice, but not together, I am only glad I didn't try the bacartea.   For some reason I also have a new hat, it's black with gold patterns on it, and pink and green little ball-bearings stuck on, and in some places little mirrors. In total I spent about 12 hours out of the house, from 2 to 2, which was nice seeing as it was my kitchen duty day - yeh beat the system. Rock.

      On Friday Me, Matt, Dave, Alice and Conner saw Mark's play "Alice in Wonderland" it was "quality entertainment." Mark kept hiding his face behind his top hat, he was wearing some sort of silly suit, and fucked up his lines at least 4 times, the best thing was the look of suprise, definately worth the steep Â£5. Most fun, even though we were almost caught using our flash camera, which were strictly banned, hard to be subtle with that, but we ducked out in time as soon as the play ended, some women was looking for us.  Then on saturday I went upto Camden with Alice to meet her friend Lou, also met Charm and Jen there, we spent a good 50 mins in burger king while Alice and Lou went for a "walk." I didn't buy anything there, in Camden everything is either too expensive to buy, or too shit and not worth the money.  And I have proof that my dad is insane. Today he handed out a sheet of paper to the whole family instructing us on when our Rota days for kitchen duty were and what we were expected to do in general around the house, after every bullet point of what we had to do to it said "don't like it? Then go live in another house and be a pig there, not ours" or sometimes "don't like it? Then leave" Which was worrying and also meant me and Dave spent a good 4 hours tidying our room, but at least now it's stupidly tidy, we threw away so much crap, filled about 6/7 big black plastic bin bags from our room and Jon's. It's taking up the whole of the hall.

      Oooookay. Tuesday Charl (who is atm on holiday) and Kathleen came round, that was fun, played alot of Mario Party 4 - which I won, but it was a good game, the gap beween us all on the leader board was very close, except for Charlotte who sucked =P. Then there was Tai Chi as normal, which was good.  Then there was wednesday, that was fun, played alot of C&C Generals, w0o, and sometime in the afternoon Charm and Jen came round, we drank tea and debated Asylum Seekers, that was interesting, and the tea was nice, Jen didn't drink her's, she said it was "hot nothing" pah.  Today - booked tickets to Mark's play, which is tomorrow, we went all the way down to the theatre with Matt at 11am, well, it was a 5 min walk, so not that impressive. Then after me and Dave went to Croydon and saw Gothika with Alice, we randomly bumped into Alex on our way to the train station, we're all to buy tickets. Jen and Charm were going to see Gothika aswell, but couldn't cos they spent all their money the night before getting pissed with some guy we only know as Alan, but it was worth it apparently, so that's nice.  Before I forget, Helen came back from Germany today with everyone else who went to Germany. She specifically asked me to edit this post and mention it, so here I am, adding a whole new paragraph just to say this. Apparently her partner for the exchange was a retard. Social retard.  Oh, and a few days ago this bus driver let me and Dave on for free cos we were twins, weird, no?

Saturday, I had my clarinet lesson as normal, afterwatrds me and Davce met Charl and Alice in Croydon, we saw Scoodby Doo 2: Monsyter's unleased, that was alright, it wa sa happy cheesy happy chessy film, most fun. But that evening I went to Alice's, and we watched Res Evil, and the end of American Beatuy, and we also manged to play Halo, w0o! We're quite far now.  Ok, now no-opne is on msn, and it's 3:12, even though my computer clock is 1 hour slow, due to a computer upgrade, and and btw, Jon is home now, incase u hasn't noticed. Today was good, we played C+C Gernarals I beat Alex and Dave, it was cool, and we just finished playing Mario Party 4 with Drinkikng rules, why ddi I agree to that if I suck at it so much?

      Yeh, last night, Fantomas ruled, and there was a really good support band aswell from Belgium, called  urlLink Flat Earth Society , they were impressive.  Not much happened today, played some video games, and some computer games, did some revision, saw Jonny English, kinda relaxed day, and I plan to repeat it tmz.  This post is too short, so here's a  urlLink funky beat  for your amusement.

      Morning everyone, I'm kinda tired.  Yesterday was the last day of school, and after that I went to Croydon with Dave, Rachel and Louise, for coffee and I had some cake. Then we went back to Rachel's for a cup of tea and then back to mine where Helen and Alex joined us, we watched the last ever Friends and Big "evil" Brother.  Today after music lessons and stuff and so on, I'm going to Fantomas with; Dave, Jon, Laura, Paul, Matt, Brooke and Ollie (I'm sure I've mentioned this list of names before, but you're getting it again) That should be most cool - I'll let you know how that goes.

      Yeh, not been upto much recently, did the 1500m today though, so I'm kinda worn out now, just a little. I'm about to go out soonish, within the next 45 mins. Also I've been playing quite a bit of Dk 2, seeing as I bought it for Â£5 - classic game.  Oh, and my Fantomas tickets arrived today, there's gunna be a few of us going; Me, Dave, Jon, Jon's friend Paul, Matt, Brooke and Ollie, and I think my friend Ashley is gunna be there to, so that's cool.  Jon would also like everyone to go to  urlLink this  website and sign the guestbook so they look popular. They're a kick ass band.  I get a cup of tea for that last paragraph.. kinda like advertising, but go there anyway, or he'll cry.

      Morning all, I only just woke up an hour ago.  I've been having a good week so far, Jon came back on wednesday, we ordered 6 Fantomas (RAWK) tickets for; me, Dave, Brooke, Matt, Jon and Paul - we're all seeing them in a week or something... Jon brought games with him, "Metal Arms: Glitch in the system" to name one, it's alot like Fur Fighters if anyone's played that before, but it's much better cos of; tanks, smoother gameplay and you're all funny robots.. sweet..  Yesterday was alot of fun, after school me and Dave met up with Rachel, Helen and Louise and went for coffee again, even though it was overpriced it was still worth it. We sat around in starbucks talking until we decided we had to leave, the staff people putting the chairs around us up and all. Heh.  Then we went back to Rachel's so they could all get changed, then went back to my house (yes it is mine.. all mine..) where we bought SEVENTY pounds worth of pizza. But it only cost Â£42 cos we bought it using special offers, we had garlic bread and salads and everything - only me and Dave finished our pizzas, but Jon ate alot of his plus alot of garlic bread, so hats off lads. Oh yeh, and we made Alex (who was also there) eat a very hot pizza slice.. it was more amusing at the time and we filmed it, he wasn't allowed home if he didn't - we hid his shoes =D  Hopefully the rest of this weekend will go well, going to Croydon today with Dave to meet Dave (lets just call him "Brooke" or "women features") which should be fun, I wanna buy another primus album, cos I'm only 1 short of owning them all. (except the live one, but that's only a compilation really so it doesn't count as much, but I'll buy it anyway at some point) Then on Sunday I'm going round to Alice's, yes, lots of Halo and tea. Heh.  Have a good week all. Hopefully this nice long post makes up for not updated at all this week, that was mostly just to piss off Matt for constantly asking me to update multiple times in one day just cos he was bored on msn.

      I think it's about time I made an update, not many people are online this early on a sunday morning, and  urlLink Brooke  just went offline to go to his guitar lesson. But I'm playing along to "the girls of porn" by Mr. Bungle on Jon's 5 string bass.  Friday was fun, after school, me and Dave met Louise, Helen and Rachel and went to for coffee, which lasted a suprisingly long time - until about 7, much fun was had by all. Although Helen didn't get the shoes she wanted.  Didn't do too much yesterday, had theory and clarinet as usual, which was why I didn't go to Soho with Brooke and Louise.  Today I have nothing on, so I'm play gunna video games, and computer games, and waste time on the internet, like now.

      Oh, and I'm gunna have to post again today, otherwise Matt will hit me =P And I think it's best not to edit the last post and get it muddled in with that.  So anyway, he would like to apologise for the last post he made me do, yeh, u know the one. There, Matt, now stop bugging me about it.

      This last week has gone really quickly, and school tomorrow, but the half term is not too far away.  Friday was really cool, me, Dave, Matt, Luke and Wellsy went to Adam's, we spent most of the time out of the house. Adam lives in a proper village where everyone seems to know everyone, quite a nice place. I dunno how much I can expand on that, but I might explain it in person (or on msn) if *you* ask me.  Saturday was tiring, I wasn't feeling too well, and there was the routine clarinet lesson and lazing around. But I played alot of Warcraft and tried to avoid the internet, and my Dad came back from Sweeden, apparently the country is 3/4 times bigger than the UK but has a population smaller than London, almost no-one no-where, like looking out into a city center and seeing 2 or 3 cars parked and a few people at max. Apparently houses are much much cheaper there aswell, but high taxes due to the electricity, gas, water etc.. having to spread so far.  Sunday wasn't so fun, didn't go to Alice's in the end, but I did play alot of Civ3 - I have relit my addiction to that game.

      Ok, Matt is making me update my blog, he's high, obviously, he said he's attracted to me, and chronic is manditory, and anyone not doing it is gay. He also say's he rules. He's at his friend Stan's house, I think they're being gay. Lets leave it at that.

      I've had a good weekend so far, David Brooke came round yesterday for video gaming madness, he lost EVERY game he played against me, and every game against Dave, but he did win a 'Me and Him vs Dave match' =P, lol. But it was a good day of video gaming, and it's safe to say he got surved. Heh. He kicks ass at FPS though, and we all bought chips and onion rings, much fun was had by all.  Today me and Dave went round to Alice's for video gaming and poor quality gore/horror films like "Urban Legend" and "Valentine" which were most funny. Still lots of confusion about Me, Alice and Lou, well we're not confused, just stuck in a dilema. I won't go into that, 'cos I might say something I'm not supposed to and cock it all up.  One more day of the 3 day weekend and it's already started, I need some sleep now, cos the internet is boring me and I need to do some english coursework.

      It seems a bit early to go on the 'net, but I just saw Gladiators for the first time in years, I never realised how cheesy and crap that program was.  I got a migrane yesterday, so didn't do much but sleep or lounge around, and today hasn't been much different, but for some reason I woke up really early (well, early for a sunday at least)  And now I have Alpha Centauri, it downloaded at last, but now I'm just waiting for the expansion pack to download so I can be an alien race, heh.  Oh, and if you haven't seen it yet, check out the flame war type thing in the comments from my last post. Yeh, thanks to those who were on my side, that's really everyone who posted, minus the lone knob-end. Well, 'nuff on that, don't want to start another one.

      Last night I went to a gig at the Charles Cryer, it was of poor quality, but I was only going to socialise. All the bands were pretty damn poor, Anna's band seemed very dressed up, and they had no drummer, and had had only one practice, and their bassist had dropped out to, so the had just found another one very recently. But they weren't as poor as the 13 year old emo kids doing Staind covers, sorry, there's just something about young emo kids being emotional with guitars that gets to me. Also playing "Solid Air" - the band Mark Doerr (son of my History teacher - I got an A in hist this year, rawk) is in, which we all agreed were a bit boring, so I got onion rings over the road. But I guess I had fun anyway, but I left early at around the time Alice left cos I couldn't be arsed with staying and seeing the end of the metal band "I EN-SLAVE YOU!! YOU EN-SLAVE ME!!!"  I've got almost all my school end of year exam results back, only the French writing and Music, cos my music teacher is incompetant and has been away all week, well, actually she turned up both days *just* after our lessons.. grur..  I'm not gunna bore you with my actual results for each subject, but four As, four Cs, and 2 Bs, which was good, seeing as 3 of my Cs were in the sciences which I really don't care about. Supposedly we're supposed to go up 2 grades from those to our actual GCSEs. More people than usual are failing this year, and my  urlLink history results  are on the school site for some reason.  Now I'm going to take over Japan in  urlLink "Shogun: Total War, Warlords Edition"   Rawk.

      Went to a party last night, it was great, saw loads of people there, and we were rocking with Sam and his friend to Orange Goblin - "We're gunna rock in a minute, but first we need to drink some warr-terr" On the way home we walked, from the other side of Pearly, through the airfield, which was realy amazing, then through Roundshaw, then through Wallington into Carshalton to my house for tea. Win.  Played some Civ3 multiplayer with Dave and Jon yesterday, it's not that good multiplayer, cos I find it goes too slow, and then I talked to a most drunk Alice on msn, she was drinking jug after jug of pimms, then I went off to said party - for which I had only 5 mins warning of - "We have to leave. Now."  But right now my throat is sore, and I just finished my coffee, yeh I know I should be drinking tea, cos it's tastier, but I figure coffee = more awakeness.  Right, that's all the talking you're getting from me, 2 posts in 2 days? CRAZY

      Haven't been able to get online recently cos my internet has been buggered, my dad's computer breaking which kinda sucks but hopefully it'll be fixed soon, we're using a crappy computer to channel the internet atm so that's why I'm online.  Today has been fun, well, yesterday, cos it's techniqually saturday, but I had my last exam and went to Croydon after with Dave and Rachel, we met Helen and Louise as normal, but not for as long, and they were speaking German *looks scared*  I bought a book (soul music by Terry Prachett)in Croydon and a DVD for my dad for father's day, it's Bill Hicks, I hope he likes it, we said we wouldn't get him that, and he said suprise me, so we decided to get it for him, heh, I think he'll like it, cos he likes most comedy stand up type people.  Then a load of people came back to my house (charl, Alice, Heather, Rachel - ok not that many people, but my house was crowded cos of mess and my whole family) and we watched a poor film "The students of Nuke'em High" or something along those lines, it was fantastic and crap at the same time, kick ass.  When I came online today I realised I had quite a few (actually only 4, one from him, and 3 others, all had apologies on the end - so maybe not 30 like he describes) e-mails with the same message from Brooke bitching at me cos I didn't say bye to him on msn, well, that was actually cos my internet buggered, so please if you would like send an e-mail to this address:  davidbrooke1165@hotmail.com  and calling him "Fryer Tuck" or "women features" =D I would be most pleased. Heh =P Oh and also go to  urlLink www.alexio.co.uk  and look on the forums for ways of getting a free mask.

      Today I had my 2 and a half hour long economics exam, it wasn't as bad as it sounds, exams aren't too bad, neither is the revision really, it's just the fact that all my mum says to me during this exam period and the weeks leading up to it is about revision, well earlier she did tell me she hated my hair =( dargh, the exams are almost over.  Today I had a shower for the first time in a long time, and now I'm clean and my hair is bouncy - more "volume" I think, but it keeps getting in my eyes, and I may suffer from sun burn more cos I have lost my pretective layer of dirt. Heh.  Now I am full, just had tea, and I ate too much, and soon I'm having fruit salad, yum. Oh yeh, and there is a comment thing now on this blog that you can leave comments on, so use it *points* yes that means *you*

      This weekend has been good, and I even managed to get some revision in. Went to the fair both days, saturday was more carnival and I saw some people I hadn't seen in a while and met some new people, saw Amy Szott, and Anna C, and talked to this guy Tom who I've seen around, it was all good. Also met up with Hannah, Helen, Alice, Charl, Kathleen, Wesley, Gareth, and then 2 of their friends James and Natalie.   Today was also pretty fun at the fair, saw a few people today; Rachel, Louise, Carly, Alex, Jen, Charm, Jax, Heather, Sam, Ollie and that was about it. Went on quite a few rides, like that nice big "King Loops" one which steals everyone's money when u go upside down, and the carousel which we weren't spun enough on. Then afterwards Jen, Charm and Louise came back to mine for some tea and a some  urlLink Alexio Project  (that link is a bit dodgy, so try refreshing, ctrl+f5-ing etc..)  Going back a bit to friday, I bought "Kyuss - Blues for the red sun" and we had coffee as usual, Dave bought two 99p videos. Brooke joined us for coffee with his gf Nush. Also Rachel couldn't make it (she abandonded us for Ollie Hutchings! =O how can he be better than me, Dave, Brooke, Louise and Helen? *gasp* =P) Brooke is now gunna join us more for coffee and we also did a bit of trying to embarress him infront of Nush, heh.  Well, more exams this week, Economics tomorrow, it's a 2 and a half hour long exam, eeek! Essay style writing and stuff, apparently that's not enought time according to my teacher, bah, I think I'm about as ready as I'll ever be.

      Today I had exams  Music - which was a joke, it was basically the revision sheet we were given but with blanks in.  French oral - went very well, I was 2 marks off an A* and it was the exact same exam I'm gunna get next year for GCSE. A whole year to try and up myself 2 marks.  English media - very hard, and there was almost nothing to get from the sheet, no facts/opions, clever techniques, just a webpage and an article on Wayne Rooney.  Tomorrow I just have RE and then it's the weekend, yay, should be good.

      This whole week has gone really quickly, but I don't actually have to go into school until Wednesday. Even though it's only year 10 end of year exams they've given us exam leave and I don't have any exams on Monday or Tuesday.  Last Friday we (Me, Dave, Louise, Rachel and Helen) all went for coffee, and Rachel saw Ollie on the way, so he joined us as well, that was cool. I also bought a Kyuss album " urlLink ... And then the circus leaves town " Then I went home and did some revision, then went to Rachel's with Dave and Heather, for food which Rachel made herself, lasagne for the main meal and then meringues for dessert.(I probably spelt both of them wrong) I was most impressed with the cooking, we had wine and sat at the dinner table and everything, it was great. Then we watched Mulholland Drive, I think I understand that film now, a bit better than I used to anyway.  Yesterday I did revision, and played this new RTS Jon got, called " urlLink Besieger " it's actually really good. Then went off to that gig in the Holy Trinity Centre, like everyone was there almost, and the bands played well, I mainly went for Joe Master cos I was eager to hear what they sounded like, and they were really good.  After said gig I went to Beddington Park with Hattie, big Tom, Emma and of course Dave. We went to the rope swing and there Daniel joined us, that was most fun. Then we all decided to go home, but cos Ging likes walking the streets at night and Tom lives just round the corner they came back to mine for tea first.  Today I only really woke up, and my mum has already told me I'm doing loads of revision today, she keeps telling me to do revision I've already done, but I plan to half half my day with revision and besieger.

I only just woke up, I would've updated this last night but everything digital orientated (basically tv and the internet) died last night, but it seems to be ok now.  Today I'm gunna stay in and get some revision done cos my exams are only a week off, but I also plan to get in some video gaming.

        I just got back from my holiday in Barcelona, it rocked.      First, we stopped off in France for 2 days in a hotel in Cahors to break the journey down a bit, there was much staying up late hiding in people's rooms so the Tutors couldn't find us. But Sam wasn't too good at that so he got us all caught twice - the second time we managed to get 13 of us in a  small  bathroom. We played a concert to some Americans, they gave us a standing ovation (cos we rock) But then we had to go watch them play, they played some Jazz, which was good, but they were all pretty fat.    Then, in Spain we went to a theme park, a water park, lots of bars, the beach, different concert venues, swimming pools and general Barcelona city centres, and I was with alot of good friends, which was nice, along with the weather - hot and sunny everyday, but somehow I didn't burn. w0op. Dave also managed to buy the hat he's been after for ages, and I got a mug from the theme park. The 8 loop roller coaster "Dragon Khan" kicked ass.    On the last night after the last concert there were the awards, I got a joint award with 2 other people "Tosser(s) of the tour award" this is refering to a drunk night of me being stubborn, silly and general refusing to go to&nbsp;bed - which&nbsp;made some people laugh, and gave some others&nbsp;a headache...&nbsp;and the other two people being sick everywhere, so I was quite good compared to them. That's 2 awards in 2 years (last year, me and Dave got the look alike award) and that's pretty damn lucky, cos there are about 60 people and about 10 awards, and it meant I got bubbles and a clap from everyone. Oh, and James "can't get it up" sorry... had to put that "in" joke in there somewhere.

       I'm going to Barcelona today, and I won't be back for 9 days.     &nbsp;   Last night I went to Jenny's fancy dress party, it was cool, everyone there (except one or two people, who got beats) was in fancy dress - I went as Julius Caesar, but was mistaken for Jesus/some sort of Greek God twice, and Sam was also Julius Caesar/Jesus/Greek God. Ollie was a pirate, Jamie was wearing a wetsuit, Ging was a women, Rob was a black man, and there were more pirates, cowboys, people in suits, slipknot&nbsp;etc.. Much fun.     &nbsp;   This last school week has been long and easy, monday I didn't do much, 'cos we had a French cover, and watched videos in other lessons. Tuesday was a school trip to the Imperial War Museum, which meant we got back late, and Wednesday was sports day; I had to run the 200 m  and the 4x300 m  relay. I came 5th in the 200 m  out of&nbsp;6 people, but Radcliff dropped out, so only 5 people ran..&nbsp;but I got the same amount of points as if 6 people ran and I was 5th, so that was nice. When I got home I worked on my English coursework for  hours,  but it was worth it.     &nbsp;   Then thursday was also long and boring, and I worked for ages on my maths coursework that day aswell, very tiring. Friday - all the coursework got handed in, and I managed to get out of Double History by playing in the house Cricket. I didn't really play, I just sat on the side lines, and somehow we won the match with only 2 batters, and Mr. Mochan said he'd give us all 7 house ties if we won, so I'll be expecting them soon. Heh.     &nbsp;   Oh, and the Flat Earth Society album I ordered arrived yesterday, and its tres good. I'm off to my clarinet lesson soonish, then I'm leaving not long after, so don't expect a post for ages unless I find a computer there.     &nbsp;   Ta ra.   &nbsp;

      Last day of my 3 day weekend. Last night was alot of fun, went round to Heather's where there were lots of people, we watched  urlLink View Askew  films; Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma, by the time we'd watched all that it was 3am so I decided to walk home instead of staying the night and seeing one more (Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) cos I was tres tired.  And friday I had an inset day, it wasn't so great, but in the evening Jon and Big Dan came back from somewhere, and we played Mario Golf, the term "Doing a Daniel" is now what we use for when someone completely fucks up their putting.  Don't think I'm gunna do much today, but right I'm talking to Brooke, he's very happy.. heh heh.. Then I'm gunna play some more video/computer games, as always, yay.

      This week so far has been a bit pointless, I had 5 cover lessons on monday, and the 3 lessons I did have were PSHE, where we do nothing anyway, and History where (cos we have Doerr) we don't do anything either.   Oh, and I figured out that in fact I was awake 30 hours at the weekend, and I got 15 hours sleep on sunday night. I don't think I'll do that again for a while, the tiredness isn't too fun.  Played in a concert last night, it went well I thought. Only 1 more week of school left after these last 2 days, cos I'm not here for the last 1/2 a week, gunna be in Barcelona, w0op.  Today Mrs. Mott gave us a party. It was shit. She sat there eating and making David Brent style jokes while we sat around talking to each other *shudders* I swear if she were only a bit more fat her eyes would disappear into her face. >.  Ok, nothing else to report really, so I'm gunna play some computer/video games now, and get a cup of tea.

      I'm feeling a bit whurr right now, cos just got back from a party, yes, it's the morning, and I didn't get any sleep at all, but it was fun.  Friday went to coffee as usual, with Louise, Brooke and Helen. Brooke had loads of hickies, which was tres funny, I also managed to buy Rach's present whilst in Croydon - we got Â£9s worth of poundland goodies. Then went to a party that evening, it was great, saw quite a few people there I knew, who I didn't expect to see there. So that was cool, and when I got home I returned to find Jon had bought Mario Golf. Sweet.  Then yesterday I had theory and clarinet lessons with a tiny hangover, but that didn't bother me much, I just sat and worked quietly. Then went off to Rach's party, lots of friendly faces there, and a drunk one to (agressive retard) heh, so that's the second party with someone pissing on furniture, but this time it was intentional. Got there about 7:30 and got home around 10:30 in the morning, so that's about 15 hours of partying.  I think I just about managed to get all the relevent information in there in that post, missed out detail and other interesting things happening to me (otherwise I'd have nothing to tell you in person =P) but that was about the rough outline, and lack of detail goes hand in hand with lack of energy, which I am severly lacking right now.   So onto a day of recovery, monitoring my body clock and Mario Golf.

      Yesterday I played alot of ' A  ge Of Mythology ' which is pretty kick ass, then I went through the    Delirivm Cordia    experience - listened to the whole thing in the dark, quite good really, hear more and more things each time round. Then in the evening I watched 'Starship Troopers 2' which I '"ordered" off the net; it was really good quality cos it was DivX, yay!  And today ' H  a  r  v  e  s  t   M  o  o  n  :   I  t  '  s   a    w  o  n  d  e  r f u   l   L i  f   e ' had already arrived before I woke up, I woke up around 10:30, and I only just stopped playing now, I've been snacking to maximize game time, and now I'm considering going nocturnal, this is one of the best games I've played in a long time.

      Today has been eventful...  Woke up early at 9 so I could change my euros back to pounds: e40 came to about Â£25. Went home, spent them on Harvest Moon on amazon, should be here soon. Then I realised my Age Of Mythology torrent had downloaded, so I installed that, using Daemon-Tools for the CD emulation - it's actually a pretty kick ass game.  Then I went to Sam's, collecting Leah on the way there, it was a 20 min walk to somewhere in Hackbridge, we watched the ring, ate (microwave) pizza and ice cream, then went home, it was pretty cool. Me, Dave and Leah got a lift with the Doerr's which was nice of them.  But as soon as I got home my mum was in a bad mood, I keep having to avoid talking to either of my 'rents cos they always tell me off for the state of a room in the house and make me tidy it; when it's blatantly been my sister who messed it up. Bloody favortism, I think it's just cos my sister has just got braces and has been milking it by putting on a lisp.  Then Jon left today aswell when I was out at Sam's, he's on a 10 day tour with his new band "Teeth," but he might be back in the middle sometime, apparently it's gunna be really "rock 'n' roll" with the tent and the vans and stuff.  Dave's making pasta, so I'm gunna go eat that soon, and then play some Age Of Mythology until I have to leave to Tai Chi, which my mum has already had a go at me for cos it'll be awkward her taking us, but she refused to let dad do it? Ok, pasta is done, best go, Dave 'tis calling me.

      Been back a while now, went to Carly's shindig (yeh, I really hate that word, but I'm using it anyway, so ner) a while ago, that was cool, we watched alot of Family Guy and Resivoir Dogs, w0op.  Had a (mario) party thing last night, it went well I thought, we had pizza, hola hoops, whiskey, wine, rum, mario golf, mario party, and there was a good turn out of people to. It didn't take much effort to get my room tidyish again, but there's a coke stain and a blood stain on my carpet; luckily I was away when Ging was producing "bits of brain," I think it was the double shot of rum that did it - my one made my eyes water.  Well, that's all for now, I've got a sudden craving for  Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 .
