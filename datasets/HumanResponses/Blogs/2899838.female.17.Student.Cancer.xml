      Tired. Not Interested. Money can make you do desperate stuff.  Like hanging on to a creepy job. Like making calls to strangers and promoting stuff that you will never believe in. I never liked this job and never will. Period. Alas! There has come a need and I am the chosen One to suffer. Why...and I also asked my fren azu 2 join with me in this.... Sin!  Nah! Life's too short for regrets... Perhaps.

      Watched  Ghillli . Twice.  Want to watch it again.  Vijay    simply rocked in the flick. Can't believe he's turning 30 this year. Everything was great about the film.  Hero, heroine, songs, dance and even the villain. Need money fast. Want to watch the movie all over again. Loved "appadi podu". I have become daring over the last few years... Previously was afraid of going to theatres. feared someone would take notice of my presence Now... fast forward 2004, feel that films are meant to be watched only in theatres and should be watched only in theatres... There's no "kick" in watching films in vcds and stuff A film's grandious stature can only be felt in a cinema or theatre for that very fact... Hey, m not a film distributor or something... Just a opinion! Check out  urlLink Ghillli 's review.

       Ruud Van Nistelrooy , A killer on the pitch. His ball skills are unbeatable 'tho there is one minor glitch... When watching Ruud Van Nistelrooy No matter what your aim, With eyes like that, one finds it hard To consentrate on the game! My heart is filled with love for Ruud And locker littered with pics, And try as i might not to think about him It's a habit I just can't kick (no pun intended) So who needs David Beckham? Cole, Owen or Henry? As gorg' as they are, and well as they play, Van Nistelrooy's for me!"   urlLink www.ruudvannistelrooy.com/   Ruud van Nistelrooy is one person who can really make me go weak on my knees. He represents utter perfection for me in every sense.     urlLink www.rvn10.com  !

      "Vous parlez espagnol?" "Non, je parle anglais." stoned. Boring, difficult moment. French lessons, i don't know anything except"j'mappelle Isabelle" and "je suis Singapourienne" and yes!  "Comment tui t'appelle?" Now i am doing an online french quiz. Dismal scores: 1/8 then 4/8... new score..1/7 Wow!  My mum would freak out if she sees the way i'm doing french. "Elle est infirmière?"-that's the question and  m suppose to come up with a answer... Let me see.. What to write? "Oui, elle travaille à l'hôpital Cochin." Finally correct.
