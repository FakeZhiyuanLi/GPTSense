      T-- and I had the pleasure of spending last week on a work-related retreat. It was a good time catching up with old friends, making some new ones, and reflecting on how we serve in  urlLink the coolest organization in the world.    The organizers of the retreat were considerate to build in some free time throughout the week. T-- and I are adventurous sorts and love exploring new places. But then reality set in on our free afternoon. We were in Syracuse, NY. In January. In a wicked snowstorm.  At least the hotel had a pool.  I love being in the water. I don’t have to carry on a conversation deeper than saying “Marco” or “Polo”. I can’t plan a to-do list. I can't multitask. All I can do is lay back and by embraced by the liquid. I love the spell of displacement it casts. I shut my eyes to keep out the medicinal sting of the chlorine. Water flows inside my ears and muffles the sound of the outside world. I float around, not conscious of space, not conscious of time.  THOK!  My head lightly bumps against the side of the pool, breaking me out of the water’s trance. I look out the window and see snow flurries chasing each other around in circles. I look up and see ice and snow on the skylight above me. Then I take a deep breath and surrender myself once again to the pool.

      Hello, fellow 'bloggers'!  I've been a friend of Gizmonic Guy and his 'Groovy Gizmonic Gang' for some 7 years now and I must say that it is an honor to be invited to be a part of their 'blog group'!  I'm certain that Mr. E. was anticipating my first foray into the wonderful world of blogging to be some sort of treatise on one of the obscure horror movies I enjoyed in my youth, a recollection of all the wonderful local-origination TV programs I grew up with in the Cleveland viewing area (thanks again for the book about Cleveland TV, Giz Guy!), a dissertation on the finer points of the musical output of Christian rock group Daniel Amos, or perhaps even an intricate look at my fascinating life-long hobby of lint-collecting.  ...But NOOOOOOOO!  Instead you're stuck with me being all 'serious-like' and 'deep' right off the bat!  Fear not, though.   This will not be some long-winded meditation.  I just wanted to share a DEEP THOUGHT that occurred to me tonight.  ...And I shall be brief!  For those of you who don't know me, I work for a local television news operation.  And in that capacity, I am occasionally called upon to produce a 'promo' for the newscast.  Well, I have to tell you that INITIALLY I always approach such assignments with much fear and loathing.  I mean REALLY...how do you make a newcast - especially a LOCAL one - seem exciting?!?  Well, I'll guarantee you...it ain't always easy!  But I find that no matter how much I may dread the task when it first comes my way, I always find that creative 'spark' eventually.  - And once I DO, I'm off and running.  Now don't misunderstand me here.  I'm not talking about my work as if it were some great masterpiece.  ..."Gone With The Wind" it ain't!  Shoot, it's not even "Scream Of The Wolf" (see below)!  But I find that the creative process makes me 'come alive' like nothing else!    Some artists work in the medium of music.  Others put their thoughts down on a canvas.  Some put their heart into a piece of pottery as it is molded on the potters' wheel.  Me...I like to shoot and edit video!  If I look back at my past, I honestly have to say that some of the happiest moments in my life came when I was involved in something creative!  For example, a friend of mine who works in local radio, Lee J., has collaborated with me on several video productions.  The first one was a project for my class at J.C.C.  The second was for a comedy show Lee was putting together to perform at the 'Reg'.    Both of those incidents found me feeling so 'up' and happy, it was like I was off on a week-long 'bender' each time!  The process of coming up with an idea, shooting the various elements needed to put that idea into action, and then editing the raw footage into a linear story-arc - and ultimately seeing your idea played out on a video screen just gets me so pumped up!  (OK, OK...I know I'm weird!)  But wait...here's where the DEEP THOUGHT kicks in.  (You thought it would never get here, right?!?)  I imagine that that's one of the reasons God loves us so much.  Stay with me here.  ...Think about it.  - In the process of creation, He's made something from nothing.  From nothingness, He created a complete Universe - one full of galaxies, solar systems, planets, animals, micro-organisms, plants, and people.  And he even created YOU.  Not by any random chance did the molecules and cells of your body come together to form the unique creature that is YOU!  (I don't care WHAT the Darwinists try to tell you!)  God must look at his creation and feel the same 'high' that I do upon finishing a creative project - only on a level at least a MILLION times more intense, of course!  - It's that feeling of satisfaction, you know?  You've put a lot of creative thought and hard work into your project - whether it be a video production, a piece of pottery, a musical composition, or in THIS case, a real live human being.  God is immensely satisfied with his creation.  He said it Himself in Genesis 1:31 - at the end of the Creation story - "God saw all that he had made, and it was very good."  God loves me!  ...And God loves you!  Don't ever forget it!!!

      Have you ever had the feeling of reading the right words at the right time? The reading of Rainer Maria Rilkes Letters to a Young Poet was one such experience for me... I can only describe the process as a bone-dry sponge hitting the water: the hardwon wisdom shared in the short tome seemed to saturate its way into my inmost being.  I was delighted to discover that from the very first letter, Rilkes words gave voice and form to my internal musings about the creative process; by the end of the book I was imagining that the poet was writing his letters directly to me, as  mentor to student.   Ive been thinking a lot about artistic endeavors lately. So much discussion about books, music, cinema or painting tends to revolve around the word controversial without ever seeming to get around to the heart of the matter: What truth about the human condition does the work convey?  Its as if were so shallow and idea poor that were stuck confusing cleverness for genius; we hail a man an iconoclast when he was merely being shocking.  Maybe the reason we dont see much great art anymore is that we insulate ourselves too well against the hurts and pains of existence. A life untouched by disappointment or tragedy will probably be left unexaminedtheres no impetus to explore the deeper meaning of things. And thats exactly where Rilke would have us go to perfect our writing.   To Rilke, your first and foremost audience is yourself. Your work will have a truth and clarity if you write about the things that you know and that are important to you: everyday events, memories, and even insignificant things that you hardly notice happening around you. Just as in any other creative art form, personal meaning is everything.  Solitude is absolutely essential to this process of discovery because answers dont come easy (if at all) for many of lifes questions. Many experiences, both good and bad, seem to just leave us with memories and question marks hanging in the air. Isolation rewards the writer, not with the answers, but an increased clarity about the human condition. Not Absolute Truth, but with the truth as he understands it. Its that conviction that breathes life into writing and makes it real.  Ive received great comfort from that. Maybe my greatest agonies and disappointments are the kindling by which my writing will ignite. Perhaps then, through this patient and steady process, my deepest wounds may become my greatest glories.

      Input, output, pennies, dimes. Try to balance your checkbook When you don’t have the time.  Cable, Electric, water and waste. So much consumption; got to keep up the Pace.  Practical, simple, generic or cheap. The most for my money, BOGO’S can’t be beat.  Coupons, credits and special offers Often eat up more time, Than fill up the coffers.  When columns are straight And numbers add up, No questions’ too hard  As long as it don’t cost too much.  Payday, profit, excess or flush. Money’s no object when you’re in the glow of Friday’s blush.  Life is stable, my butt’s off the hook, When I manage to maintain balance in my Blue checkbook.

      Sunday nights haven't been the same since Agents Mulder and Scully closed the book on The X-Files and vanished off our TV screens in the process.  No more nasty things creeping around suburbia after the sun goes down. No more experiments run amok. No more government cover-ups.  What are poor nerds like me do to fill the void?  Television thrives on the stealing of good ideas. I was weaned on the tube back in a magical time called the 1970s, when every single show in prime-time seemed to be a spin-off of Happy Days or All in the Family. But the highly-paid creativity thieves of network TV have never been able to create a decent counterpart to The X-Files.  Remember Dark Skies? Does The Burning Zone ring a bell? Did you catch Strange World in the few weeks it was on the air?  X-Files creator Chris Carter almost pulled it off with Millennium, but the program too quickly settled into a “serial killer of the week” format until its self–destruction in a confusing plotline which occurred after most of us had long since stopped watching. A surprising non-hit which aired in its big brother’s coveted Friday night spot.  The crucial element to the The X-Files, which all of the imitators seemed to miss, was its believability. I realize that might seem a contradiction in terms while describing what is essentially a modern-day spook show, but the key to a good fantasy is keeping one foot firmly planted in reality.  The Brothers Grimm knew it, weaving their tales around common people and events before introducing more fantastic elements... Edgar Rice Burroughs did too, and conformed his Tarzan and John Carter of Mars books to elaborate biographies, family trees, and timelines... The Night of the Living Dead (1968) is probably the scariest horror picture ever made because filmmaker George Romero placed it in modern-day Western Pennsylvania rather than a gloomy Transylvanian castle.  What works in fairy tales, books and movies works on television as well. The original Star Trek masked the dodginess of its futuristic sets largely because of a likable cast and a refreshing lack of technobabble (dilithium crystals not withstanding). Rod Serling and Richard Matheson wrote compelling characters and storylines into The Twilight Zone that kept people on their edge of their seats every week. The Jon Pertwee episodes (1970 - 1975) of Doctor Who had a higher shock quotient than the rest of the series by bringing an endless parade of alien menaces to the bell-bottom wearing England of the seventies, rather than some space station set far in the future.  I think the judge of good sci–fi, fantasy and horror television is how well the program allows people sitting at home eating corn chips on the couch the suspension of disbelief. It’s easier said than done. That’s why for every Star Trek, television execs churn out dozens of Cleopatra 2525s.  The X-Files did genre television one better, which was to achieve a level of believability more on the level of drama programs like E.R., Homicide, or NYPD Blue. It seemed that no matter how outlandish the plot in TV guide summary, at least from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Sundays, it could be happening in your hometown -- or worse yet, your basement!  Closing the book on The X-Files was a sad day for science-fiction fans, of which I consider myself. The program will be missed.  But hope is on the horizon! Nerds left scrambling for a paranoia–inducing fix need look no further than the series Ultraviolet. But don’t don’t expect to find it channel surfing. It’s a British import from Channel Four Television, and is only available in this country as part of a DVD boxed set from Palm Pictures.  Ultraviolet is the story of homicide detective Michael Colefield, trying to track down his best friend and partner, who disappeared mysteriously on the eve of his wedding. Colefield’s investigation soon runs afoul of the covert organization CIB -- a cooperative venture between the British government and the Vatican.  Why are its agents using strange weapons like rifles with ultraviolet sights, charcoal–tipped bullets and tear gas that smells like garlic in its campaign against a common counterfeit ring? And how is his best friend tied up in all this?  Before long, Jack finds himself drafted against his will into the enigmatic organization and uncovers a decidedly supernatural conspiracy that affects not only his best friend, but the fate of the entire human race.  The production team deserves praise for its iconoclastic approach to a too-familiar legend that in lesser hands would probably turned into a campy mess along the lines of Buffy, the Vampire Slayer. The acting and production values maintain a high-level of believability throughout, with plenty of shocks delivered over six episodes.   Ultraviolet is compulsory viewing for fans of the macabre. The conspiracy builds to a nail-biting climax that leaves you guessing until the last edge-of-your-seat minute. And until Chris Carter and company get on the stick with their promised series of films, it’s the closest thing we’ve got to an X-Files revival.

      Can You Drink the Cup is a book of meditations by the late  urlLink Henri J.M. Nouwen , a Catholic priest, psychologist, educator, and social worker. In this slim volume (111 pages), he uses the metaphor of a cup to describe life. Drawing much from his work with the developmentally disabled, Nouwen demonstrates the rare ability to express the most profound ideas in simple everyday language. By the first few pages into the book, I felt as if I knew this remarkable man -- he really seemed to be sharing his heart.  This isn't the Purpose Driven Life. It's not a step-by-step guide to finding fulfillment in your life. Nouwen celebrates "drinking" the good things that life has to offer, but he doesn't shy away from the adversity that we are all served as well. His message is both simple and profound: that living life to the fullest comes through drinking all of it, and that God can give us the courage to do so.  Recommended reading!

      The clan and I went on a most excellent roadtrip today to the  urlLink Albright-Knox Art Gallery  in Buffalo. Its permanent exhibit was a lot larger than I anticipated, and the collection had a nice variety. I've been thinking a lot about the state of the world lately, and it occurred to me how fortunate I was to have the luxury to walk around a gallery looking at art.  We aren't enthusiasts of any particular period or style. It was interesting to discuss with my kids (7 & 10) what makes a particular painting or sculpture interesting and why one picture over another makes an emotional connection. My daughter, H--, was quite adept at articulating her impressions.  On the other hand, my son, N--, tired of the experience and was looking to move onto our next stop (The Apple Store) as quickly as possible. I took him aside and explained that an art gallery required patience to really appreciate the work, and he would enjoy himself more if he lingered at each piece rather than rapidly move from painting to painting. He enjoyed the few examples of pop art in the museum, but was still a little too young to appreciate some of the other work. He expected each painting to be realistic and couldn't understand why "the people look so weird." On the other hand, he got a belly laugh out of any artwork displaying a nude figure. Ahh, to be a 7 year old boy again...

      Here I am joining this Experiment House Blog with my husband, old friend of my husband and another old friend of my husband. But if you want to become technical about it, I'm one of the oldest original "friend of my husband." So it all makes sense.  Usually the token chick is little more an afterthought in sitcoms and movies when it come to their placement with small groups of guys. The Little Rascals had that brunette girl, the Batman sequel had Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl, Seinfeld had Elaine and these guys have me. I have something more than comedy genius or a cool super-hero costume, I have a history with these guys. I know where they come from, they make me laugh, and they even like to read the stuff that I write. That's way better of a deal than Batgirl's offer.  So cheers to the guys that asked me to join in and never have called me the token chick of our group. Stay tuned for more developments from the Experiment House. This Clubhouse welcomes the girls.

      B-- was the closest thing I've ever seen to a ghost. She had already long been attending the church by the time I got there in the early nineties, and I'm ashamed to admit that I didn't take the time get to know her until this last year. She was quiet and meek, and spoke her words slowly and carefully. To have a conversation with B-- required one's full attention. If one made too much noise it would drown out the sounds of her words. If one moved around too much or gave the impression of being distracted it could scare her frail form off and she would recede away into the mist. When everything in my life screamed at me to go faster and to multitask, B-- made me slow down and enjoy the moment.   B-- was part of a small group of us who got together on Sunday evenings to pray, read scripture, and encourage each other in our faith. It became apparent in our conversations that she was the rare person who walked with one foot on earth and the other in eternity.  And now she is fully in eternity with the God that she so knew and loved.  B--, I miss you.

      Understand my heart. Can you? Will You? Try to see. The hope for a future. A hope to be me.  The days to fill And nights to rest. What could be better, What could be best?  To breathe deep,  To laugh loud. To hope for the unbelievable, unconceivable – Only the imaginable.  Perfection, protection, transportation and time- My heart understood, A life so sublime.

      Remember when TV movies didn’t suck?  It was back in a mythical time called the early 1970s. Why, I remember having to walk twenty miles in a blizzard just to pay the cable bill. Barefoot even!  But it was worth it. And I’d do it all again in a heartbeat just to get another glimpse of Marcia Brady. TV was wonderful then. Conflicts always came down to a simple matter of black and white and were easily solvable in a thirty to sixty minute time slot. Just like in real life.  Television was the “plug-in drug.” And Americans were darn happy about it! It allowed us to ignore things like the Vietnam War, the changing roles of women, civil unrest, and Ringo Starrs’ solo career.  Teachers would often scold that TV was making us into a nation of idiots. We ignored them and continued doing multiplication with our fingers. Ralph Nader warned us that TV was molding us into a unthinking nation of consumers. We scoffed at him and went right back to making out our Christmas lists. In September. Psychologists counseled us that TV was going to give us short attention spans.  Sorry. Where was I?  Oh yeah. TV movies. Unlike the 1980s, when every single made–for–television film was about some mean disease disrupting some nice woman’s perfect life, the networks of the 1970s made movies that entertained. You know, stuff that would make a viewer proud as a peacock!  Doesn’t the following list of films just send you into a groovier, happier place: The Feminist and the Fuzz... Satan's School for Girls... The Ghost of Flight 401... Where Have All the People Gone?... Well, I could go on...  How about Nightmare in Badham County... Shark Kill... Cotton Candy... Sweet Hostage... Killdozer...  Want more? The Sex Symbol... Bad Ronald... Terror on the Beach... and the subject of today’s review Scream of the Wolf.  A made-for-TV werewolf movie? How can you go wrong? You can’t -- especially when you have the winning team of Peter “Mission Impossible” Graves, Dan “Dark Shadows” Curtis, and Richard “Twilight Zone” Matheson on your side!  The film opens on a lonely, mist-shrouded country lane. Not in Transylvania, but somewhere almost as scary -- Northern California. In a really freaky point–of–view scene, a werewolf chases down its first victim -- a hapless salesman looking for a phone.  The next day. Cue 70s funk music with horns and that guitar that makes a sound like which–a–choo which–a–choo which–a–choo. Cut to an arial shot of five police cars speeding down the road to the body of the victim and his demolished convertible.  I have a few observations to make about the (never named) town’s ineffectual police force. The murder occurred late the previous evening. In this shot, the bright sunshine and direction of the shadows leads me to believe that it is obviously midday. Was it really necessary to risk life and limb racing down a serpentine mountain road with sirens blaring 12 hours after the murder occurred?  I can only surmise that speeding around and running the sirens makes this collection of Barney Fife’s feel like real G–men or something. Because there isn’t a single shot, no matter how mundane, of police cars in the entire film when the sirens aren’t yelping! My favorite example of this is when six cars and 1 highway patrolman shut down the entire street, pull into city hall, and walk inside to give a press conference. I pity the poor souls that work third shift in this town.  Another thing I noticed is that this tiny little town has a huge police force. One time I counted eight cars, a dozen uniformed officers, and numerous bloodhounds at the scene of a murder. Don’t get me wrong -- I’m a big proponent of more police protection -- but property taxes must be awful.  But having a police force the size of Hannibal’s army doesn’t do the slow-witted sheriff any good. So he does what any good law enforcement official would do in his situation: he consults an expert, in this case “Mr. Weatherby”, a writer of wildlife books... Not to be confused with that other Mr. Weatherby, the rotund principal of Archie fame.  Sometimes the lead casting of a film is pure magic. Can you imagine anyone other than Clark Gable bringing Rhett Butler to life in Gone With The Wind? Or some hack actor like Ronald Reagan replacing Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine in Casablanca? I now proudly submit to this list Mr. Peter Graves for his groundbreaking role of Mr. Weatherby in Scream of the Wolf.  Alas, no one else could have brought such life and sparkle to lines such as:  “Have a little coffee.”  and  “Sure, come on!”  Plus, he’s so cool in this movie frost started to form on my television. He gets to drive a showy red sports car. He lives in a palatial bachelor’s pad on a cliff by the Pacific Ocean. He even can ignore his girlfriend for weeks at a time and get back in her good graces just by flashing that winning smile of his. Did I mention that he gets to drive a showy red sports car?   Man, I wish I was Peter Graves.  Since bit players in horror movies stubbornly continue to put themselves at risk with the full knowledge that a killer is on the loose, more people die. My vote for best victim is the guy who goes walking down the same exact road as the first murder the very next evening. (I actually had to play that part of the DVD over to make sure that it wasn’t intended to be a flashback.) Honorable mention goes to the couple making out in the trailer. Their approach to, uh, petting, seems to be wrestling around like bear cubs on an old blanket. And because this is a made-for-TV movie, the only item of clothing that is removed is their socks. You just can’t make stuff like this up, folks.  Peter Graves points out to the police that the murderer’s tracks always change from four footprints to two in a just few steps. Even though this information will have the average four-year old screaming at the screen, “It’s a werewolf, people,” neither Peter Graves or the police make that connection.  But one person does make the connection: Peter’s girlfriend played by Jo Ann “how–do-you-prounounce-my-last-name” Pflug. She pieces the whole mystery together and even spills the beans on the twist ending not only once, but TWICE in the first half of the movie. Look for those scenes and marvel.   Is Scream of the Wolf worth the four or five bucks the DVD will run you at a department store? I’d say yes. It isn’t Citizen Kane, but it is a pleasant way to zone out for 78 minutes and delivers some fun shocks along the way. Even a dozen unresolved plot threads and a silly trick ending can’t ruin it.  Anyway, have you looked at TV Guide lately? The best thing on tonight is What’s Happening to My Knee? One Woman’s Battle with Osgood-Schlacter's Syndrome of the Tibia Tuberal!

      I gotta tell ya... It's tough finding a decent radio station out here in the sticks... There's just way too much pop clogging up the airwaves -- Britney, Christine, Jessica, and Justin. I truly wish Clay Aiken WOULD become invisible! It just seems like wherever I turn the radio dial I'm going to hear the same 20 or so artists.  If you think that infomercial have ruined television, automation has killed local radio. There are just so many "canned" formats out there right now. Having an announcer pre-record his bits all in one sitting may be economical, but it's a drag to listen to. I want to hear some comments about the news item that played 10 minutes ago, or what's going on right now in the weather, or on the street outside the studio.  I've observed that radio has become a lot more professional over the last few years, but has lost a lot of personality in the process. (That's not to say that it's the talents fault. I know so many capable people in the biz, but they aren't the ones running the show. In many cases, the ownership-management isn't even in the same state as the station.)  I've turned to the internet for some of my listening needs. I'm addicted to a radio program called  urlLink Vinyl Cobwebs . A new show gets posted every week (or so) out of Salt Lake City. The DJs, Donovan and Premium Deluxe, aren't slick or professional sounding. They are politically-incorrect and drop-dead funny.  They're having fun and it comes through the speakers. What kind of music do they play? Oldies. Real obscure ones. One-Hit Wonders. Novelty records. Doo Wop. Big Band.  Check out the link to the right and download the latest episode in mp3 format. This is the way radio should be.

      My wife and I work for The Salvation Army in southwestern New York State. Most people assume that means we work at a used clothing store or something. Actually, we pastor a small church (!) for the organization that seeks to be "a church for people who don't like church." We aren't really trying to be some hip, modern production, (one visit on a Sunday morning would disprove that theory) just a community of people who can be authentic with each other and God.  We took a trip on Sunday to visit  urlLink The Freeway , a newish Salvation Army church in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. It's always beneficial to see how other people approach establishing a new church. Keep the good ideas and dump the rest and all that!  We really enjoyed ourselves. Authentic community and nice people. We'd recommend it to anyone in the Hamilton area. Our approach to "doing church" is very similar, and we found ourselves comforted by that fact. It's hard doing something new in the church, and it seems like no matter how sincere your intentions or how good your results, that there are always people ready to "throw a stone" that you aren't doing it the old-fashioned way. It's natural to second-guess yourself sometimes, and my wife and I had been doing a lot of that lately. As my wife joked on our drive out of Hamilton, "It's nice to know we aren't the only crazy ones..." It was good to meet some people who knew the joys and struggles of establishing a nontraditional church plant.

      I just noticed that it's already February 29. That month went by fast! Here are a few of its highlights:  T-- and I have been running around like insane maniacs trying to satisfy all the demands of work. My mom decided to give us a much needed break by taking our kids for the whole Valentine's Day weekend. I'll admit it -- I was looking forward to three days of bliss and decadence. Unfortunately, the romantic weekend began with me waking up with a fever, sinus infection, and a headache. I looked in the mirror and discovered that my tongue was dark green, which is something I only thought happened in cartoons. So I spent the weekend on the futon with the remote control. T-- made the best of it by dragging my sweaty, shaky carcass to  urlLink Max & Erma's  in Erie for an early afternoon Valentine's Day hamburger. I felt like such a loser. I didn't even have a card or present for her as my wallet was missing and I hadn't been able to leave the house (let alone drive) for the previous few days. What a sport -- she let me live anyhow. The storybook evening abruptly ended around 7 pm when I started to pass out in a store. Who says romance is dead?  Not once, not twice, but three times in one month I got to hang out with my good friend B--. I've known him for about fifteen years and don't get to see him nearly enough. We got to spend some time talking about our place in the world, good books, and our faith. B-- is a real authentic guy and he was just what I needed to perk me up in a month adrift in budget woes at work, cold weather, and the flu bug harassing my whole family.  My sad tale of my $288 dollar dinner... T-- and I decided to spend my 36th birthday at a fancy restaurant in Buffalo. We were also going to spend a fun evening with a friend who was moving to NYC. But our front passenger tire had other ideas and blew out on the NYS Thruway. You can imagine what condition the rim was in as I driving 70 mph at the time. But we were safe, and spent the evening at McDonald's while the Pep Boys fixed the car next door. The total? $8 on dinner, $280 on the car... I can't wait until our anniversary! Maybe we can eat at Wendy's while the Neon gets a new transmission!   I had the privilege of sitting by the bedside of a friend during the last few hours of his life. D-- pretended he was an awful curmudgeon, but he really had a good soul. He spent the last couple years of his life caring for his mentally retarded brother and it's one of the greatest examples of love between two people that I've ever seen. Bon Voyage, D--. (Also -- I've really been struggling with the whole "pastor thing" lately. I felt so inadequate in that hospital room with a dying friend, and grieving family and friends, but paradoxically this was one of the few times in the last couple of months that I felt like a minister. Odd.)  Last Friday, J-- organized a trip to see comedian  urlLink Ken Davis  in North Tonawanda. I'm a big fan of religious satire, but I usually shy away from the whole Christian comedy thing because it's so rarely done well. But it turned out that this show was just what the doctor ordered to dissipate some of the stress of my last few days. Thanks, J--. You make church fun. (My 7 year old son hated, hated, hated this event. At one point during the show he turned to the man next to him and said, "This guy's not funny. Pass it on." Afterwards he summed up the evening by saying, "This was the most pathetic thing I've ever seen." The rest of our group thought Ken was a blast, though.)  I have yet again missed the monthly meeting of the  urlLink Allegheny Region Macintosh User Group  meeting in Warren, PA. I love Macs. They love Macs. They are my kind of people. Despite the best intentions of my Palm Pilot, I always find myself forgetting the monthly meeting date and time. Sheesh. It's like being gay and sitting alone in a closet while there's a roller disco next door. I resolve to make it to the March meeting!  And that was the month that was... February 2004...

      Roald Dahl uses a wonderful mix of sarcasm, realism, and fun in the delivery of “James and the Giant Peach.” The characters are solid and well defined. James is an inexperienced but compassionate leader, Spike and Sponge are consistently nasty, and the collection of creatures inside the peach  all take on believable personalities; even if the setting is filled with fancy and imagination.   The seriousness of themes that Dahl covers in this book may be surprising. Some of the situations experienced by James and the other characters are: death of family members, abuse, neglect, interpersonal conflicts, war and fear of the future; but Dahl  manages to balance stressful situations with care by adding strange or silly occurrences so as not to overwhelm the young reader.   Dahl uses each difficult situation in the book to allow for the further development of James’s character. In the beginning of the book James is happy and carefree, living in a loving environment with parents, family and friends. He has little to be worried about and is only concerned with his happy little world - but nothing outside of this self focused life.  The sudden death of his parents cracks open the security and self concern of his life; and he finds himself living with his two evil aunts. The aunts Spiker and Sponge are very selfish and vain women, spending their time feeding their obsessive egocentric appetites. The only reason James even exists in their world is so he can serve them.  James takes on all of the adult responsibility in the time he lives with his aunts. James cleans, chops wood and waits upon to wants of these awful women. The work he does is unrewarding and difficult and the home atmosphere is cold and uncaring.      James is at the ultimate limit. He once lived a life full of caring and contentment and now his world is dark and lonesome. Because James has seen such a dramatic change  in his personal life, he begins to look outward for ways to improve it. This change is important, because it is the beginning  of James realizing that there is more to life that just his personal world. James begins to understand that somewhere, there is a better, happier way to live and he must do something to change the status quo.  Up until this point, James never has taken a time-out. He has been in this battle for a very long time, and it is time to admit that it all is just to much. This change in James, a willingness to take a chance, is a catalyst for all the character development there is to come for him.  At this pivotal moment , James meets someone who has the power to change his life. He meets a small, strange little man. Odd that this character could be so important, but often times we are deceived by appearances - aren’t we?  Amazingly, the bag full of glowing, green, living, crystals this strange little man possess contains ... “more power and magic in there ...than in all the rest of the world put together. This is it! This is what James needs! The weird, little man advises James what to do, and what not to do with this wonderful gift , and he disappears.  James runs to do what he was told, but in his hurry he falls and looses his treasure and hope for his future. In this movement when failure looks certain, the power of the crystals begins to work their magic on the old peach tree in the aunt’s dreary, overgrown, garden.   The magic in this story is so influential that it could be said to be a character itself. When life seem hopeless and overwhelming, the magic crystals are dropped into James’s life like, well ...magic. Some readers my criticize the magic  of “James and the Giant Peach as too predictable, but I feel that Dahl uses magic to turn and alter the plot in unexpected ways. This idea of  magic also supports the idea that there is a power beyond our own strength. The magic of the crystals enter into the base of the peach tree and cause a series of fantastic and wonderful things to happen. The old peach tree bears a beautiful, overgrown peach that draws visitors from all over England to see it.   The aunts are now more concerned about themselves than before and focus their attention completely on making millions from the sale of tickets to see the giant peach. James has changed, as he looks to the outside world for some hope. He thinks that this wonderful peach represents how different his life can be, compared to how horrible it is at the moment.  The aunts have remained the same in character, only becoming more obsessed with their greed for more. James is left cold and hungry, to do only more work for his aunts, and in spite of his aunt’s repeated warnings to keep away from the peach, he is drawn to it’s enormous base to get a closer look.  Change, excitement and curiosity  are  evident as for the first time in this story the approach in description of the scene takes on warmth, color and an overall positive feeling. The peach is " soft and warm and slightly furry, like the skin of a baby mouse."” James finds a opening in the bottom of the peach and climbs in. He is not the hesitating, fearful boy he was only a few moments ago; he is overcome with excitement and nothing is going to stop him now. When James enters the  opening of the peach , he is entering a world that is totally foreign to him. The entrance leads to a tunnel, and the tunnel leads to the “stone” or center of the peach that has a little door cut into it. When James opens the door and enters the main room, he is bombarded by the voices of creatures beyond compare.   The cozy room is fill with adult sized insects, that vary in species as well as personality. First, there is a genteel  Old-Green-Grasshopper, a surprisingly kind but enormous black Spider, a sweet scarlet Ladybug, a worrisome earthworm and a sassy mouthed Centipede. James, being so used to his aunt’s abuse, backs away from the creatures in a panic and looks for a way to escape.  The creatures speak to him, making sure James knows that they don'’t want to eat him.  James carefully listens to the creatures, initially out of fearful obedience, but remains attentive due to his growing curiosity.   The group of creatures inside the peach are diversely different from each other. The Centipede proudly describes himself as a “pest”. The Earthworm describes himself as "a  useful and much loved creature."”  The Old Green Grasshopper is a “musician.” Lady Bug modestly tells the others that her kind is much loved by farmers for the service of eating harmful bugs and keep their fields healthy. Miss Spider knows that she is helpful in her life work, but is bothered that people don'’t think as fondly of her as they would a lady bug. "“It is very unfair the way Spiders are treated"”, Miss  Spider says, as she explains how Aunt Spiker flushed her father down the drain just last week. Later, she tells how Aunt Sponge violently squashed her dear grandmother, whom was accidentally  trapped in the sticky ceiling that had been freshly painted. The descriptions of life from a bug’s point of view, allow the reader to become connected to characters. The young reader can relate to all creatures because at some point in life they have felt like, a pest, as a useful and well loved person , as a musician or entertainer , as well as  having their motives misunderstood or despised -  even when doing a good deed.  The reader is likely to pick a favorite character from this band of over grown insects, based upon personal experience and the feelings evoked when reading about each character. Dahl shows a great ability in providing colorful supporting characters. even though they a fictional, because  they are so easily connected with. James finds himself, in a very short period of time, caring a great deal for the welfare of his new friends. His quick acceptance of  these first frightening creatures only encourages the reader to open themselves up to their quirky but lovable personalities. This experiment in a child’s acceptance of the odd and unusual, continues to drive home a primary message of this  book. We need to give everyone a chance to grow,  before we short-sightedly place limits on what they are capable of achieving.   As the story continues, the reader is introduced to some more subtle creatures that are living in the peach with the rest of the group - glow worm and silkworm. These two are quieter the the others, but they are shown as helpful to the others partially because of light and string they produce when needed. The fact that they are quiet does not suggest that they are less important, in fact it shows that because they are permitted to use their gifts and skills - that they are indeed are appreciated.  Throughout the story, James is given many opportunities to help in dire situations. After centipede chews the peach free from the old peach tree and the evil aunts are killed as  they stand in the path of the runaway peach, James seems to be released from the fear and despair that had bound him for so long. In the midst of rolling down the aunt’s hill, billowing into the village, and bouncing across the English countryside, James and his friends in the peach splash into the ocean in a  somewhat ruffled  and confused state of mind. But James now seems more determined to enjoy the adventure at hand.  At this point in the story, the creatures are full of bumps, bruises and a sense of fear of what on earth can happen to us next. James take the lead at this time to calm  his friend’s fears and give them the direction they now need. It is out of compassion and concern for the others, that James patently explains that they will be all right as they bob along in the ocean in their wonderful peach.   For James and the others, the crisis's keep coming, from need of food and water to shark attacks; but each time a problem arises James finds an answer. His solutions range from logical (Eat some of the peach.), to quite creative (Lasso hundreds of seagulls with rope made by Silkworm and Miss Spider, using earthworm as “bait”, in order to lift the peach out of the water.). Each situation causes James to consider that his choice could be the wrong one, but this fear of failure does not keep him from doing his best to help his friends.  This test of James’s character  reinforces another theme in the story; you must be willing to take a risk when helping others if you are to make a difference in people’s  lives. In other words: How can you expect people to follow you if you are not willing to lead?  Often times in leadership situations, the hardest thing to deal with is interpersonal conflicts. Either someone in the group thinks he/she should be the leader or someone dosen't trust the leader’s direction. James has opportunity to deal with both of these situations during the adventure-filled voyage. Unfortunately, the Centipede and Earthworm are the foremost culprits in all of these disturbances. James  adores both of them, but their actions cause many difficulties for the crew on the trip. As James devises his fantastic plan to escape the vicious sharks, Earthworm fusses and fumes that this idea will never work. In his close refusal to help the others, he wastes precious time and energy  needed to succeed in  escaping from the sharks. When James takes control of the situation, by going with earthworm to assure his safety on his dangerous task,  earthworm reluctantly agrees to help in the effort. It is only after the peach is  flying with the aid of the  five hundred and two seagulls, that Earthworm believes in James as a leader. It is interesting that though the Earthworm is blind (earthworms have no eyes), he has to experience or “see” James' ability to lead before he believes it.   Centipede proves to be the least able to follow James' leading in comparison to the others, due to his desire for everyone’s attention (Centipede has a game show host personality, complete with jokes, dancing and clever songs about their adventures.) and his inability to control his own behavior.   Throughout the story, Centipede is constantly picking on one member of the crew or another. Much of the time his insults are directed at Earthworm, one of the harshest during the shark attack: “"My dear Earthworm, you'’re going to be eaten anyway, so what difference does it make whether it’'s sharks or seagulls?” ...” You will be a martyr... I will respect you for the rest of my life.") It is in this rough manner Centipede carries on his conversations and it causes many arguments. Centipede’s irresponsible behavior often puts the other crew in jeopardy. After the successful escape from the sharks, Centipede breaks into song and dance and in his distracted state dances right off the top of the peach into thin air. Miss Spider spindles out a line and James reels over the side of the peach to recover Centipede from the freezing water below.  The result of his careless action leaves Centipede shaken, Miss Spider frustrated by his behavior, and James reinforced in the role as the level-headed leader.  As the peach floats gracefully through the clouds, the crew discover a strange species of “Cloud Men”, that work at high altitudes making hail, rain, snow flakes and rainbows. The entire crew is amazed and  fearful of the Cloud Men, except Centipede; who instead of quietly observing the odd view casts insults at them. Centipede’s outburst causes the Cloud Men to launch a full assault of hailstones causing several of the crew to be injured as well as the peach taking so much damage that it begins to leak peach juice. Next, the dripping peach collides into a freshly painted rainbow - sending the Cloud Men into a full attack. The Centipede finally takes some positive action by chewing off the seagull lines the Cloud men shimmy down in attempt to down the peach. At the end of this attack, the peach is dripping juice more than ever and Centipede is covered in rainbow paint that has dried so he can’t move or speak. In a final effort to repay Centipede for the damage done, the Cloud Men turn on the faucets. The water pours down, drenching the crew completely as though they had walked through a waterfall. The only benefit if this is that Centipede is released from his prison of paint and is free to dance and sing once again. One redeeming quality of Centipede though, is that he does not give up easily when a fight is to be found. The problem though is that he seems to look for fights. In spite of his flaws, Centipede serves a valuable purpose in this story. Centipede’s stories, songs and antics provide much of the comic relief need to balance to stressful and serious themes dealt with in this story.   Night has passed at last, and the crew find themselves stunned to see the coast of America in the early light of dawn. It seems impossible that crossed the ocean so quickly, but much of what they have lived through would have seemed impossible if they hadn't lived it. James finds the peach quickly approaching New York City, and is left to come up with a solution to a new problem. How do they get down? As he works on the solution, all of New York City recognizes the approaching orange mass not as a giant peach,  but as a bomb threatening the safety of the city and its citizens. Centipede is given the job of chewing off the seagull lines a few at a time  to gradually lower the peach to a gentle landing. The plan is working and the peach is dropping slowly until a jet swishes by the peach, cutting all the seagulls lines leaving James and  the crew plummeting to the ground. The city , James and the peach crew all fear the worst and they all share whatever quick words of comfort they can in the midst of their calamity.   Magically, the peach lands directly on top of the Empire State Building. It is perfectly perched atop the building with the needle  running directly through the center of the giant peach. The crew inside the peach was secure, but New York still did not know what this giant orange ball was or what it’s intention was. It was not a bomb, or a ship from outer space, but what it was they did not know for sure.   Here we are again, where something unfamiliar, or odd is dropped into our lives and we don’t know what to do with it. The initial reaction to the crew of the peach is what you would expect: fear, bias, rumor and confusion. It is only when the Police and Firemen see James and listen to what he has to say, that they understand that the Centipede, Grasshopper, Miss Spider, Ladybug, Earthworm, Glow Worm and Silk Worm are "the nicest creatures in the world."  At James' declaration and song exhorting the wonderful qualities of his new friends, all of New York welcomes them all as heroes and long lost family. Not only do the adults immediately fall in love with James and his friends, but the children of the city  embrace them as well. James invites the children of the city to eat the peach as the city celebrates the new friends that have come join the community.  James and the Giant Peach is a lovely story, complete with a happy but educated ending. The city is delighted, the children adore James and the fantastic stories he tells , and the crew of the peach find fulfilling jobs and new friendships in New York City. Most of all, James is finally, truly, happy. He has a happy home constructed out of the peach stone in Central Park . He has new friends  to play with every day, and old his friends from the peach crew visit often.  James has seen the good, the bad and the good side of life once again. The love of his parents he will carry with him always, the lessons of greed and selfishness of his aunt’s he will never forget. By gaining a better understanding of all people, no matter size, shape or species; James has learned some valuable lessons. 1.) Give both the eccentric and common folk around you the time and opportunities  to grow into their capabilities. 2.) You can take care of yourself by taking care of those around you.  There are millions of people out there, and every one of us has some growing to do. The journey for each and every one of us is different and filled with many obstacles. It is through these challenges, that we define what in our character needs to stay ...and what needs to go. If we hold onto hurt and loss for too long, we can find ourselves bound by bitterness and pain - unable to help ourselves or anyone around us. James had a great deal of hurt he could have held on too. but clinging too it would have paralyzed him.   Take a risk. James did. Try something impossible. James did. Open your heart to a new journey. James did.  Even though the road James took to arrive at a place where he could feel safe and loved was difficult, he never returned to be lost to despair. Even when James’s future seemed to hold no promise, he never let go of hope for a better future. Take the first step, there’s a whole world out there and the journey’s just begun.

      I have a confession to make. The second-to-last thing I feel like doing tonight is writing in my online journal, and the last thing I feel like doing is being funny. (The reasons will become apparent in a future journal.) But I made a promise to myself that I would try to write something every day, so here goes:  Ever notice how movie theater marquees abbreviate the titles of movies? "The Passion of the Christ" becomes "Passion", "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the Kings" becomes "LOTR". I don't mind one bit. In fact, I rather enjoy the mental challenge of deciphering whether a marquee proudly announcing "LEAGUE" seeks to infer that the theater is playing "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen", "A League of Their Own", or "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea". But my imagination got the best of me when I saw the following sign outside the Arnott Mall proudly announcing:  THE BUTTER EFFECT  I imagined this scenario: Struggling with high blood pressure and lack of energy, Ashton Kutcher devises a technique of traveling back in time to inhabit his slim childhood body. He discovers that the weight watcher journals he keeps under his bed are a means by which he can travel into the past so he can switch all the cola in his parents' refrigerator to diet. As he attempts to lower his cholesterol, he finds that every trip into the past causes him to have weird blood sugar levels in the present, leading him to travel back again and again and causing irreparable damage to his arteries.

      I saw a sign outside of a bar and grill in Mayville NY. It advertised:  BIG ASS FISH FRY FRIDAY  Did the sign maker mean to imply that I'd gain a big ass if I ate their fish fry? Or does it mean that I need a big ass to be served their hearty fish fry, in which case I'm sure I'd qualify. Or does it mean that I would have to be a big ass to get suckered into ordering their putrid fish fry?  It's so nice to see local merchants support with the Lenten season with such sensitivity.

      Whew. What a day. It began with a budget meeting, which is never good, and ended by the bedside of a friend who is dying. It would be inappropriate for me to try to write something witty and funny about some B-Movie, and I'm too close to the grief of my friend's condition to articulate my feelings in any coherent fashion. So I just thought I'd share something from my favorite birthday present,  urlLink Celtic Daily Prayer: Prayers and Readings From the Northumbria Community :  "All that I love into Your keeping All that I care for into Your care. Be with us by day, be with us by night; and as dark closes the eyelids with sleep, may I waken to the peace of a new day."

      I saw another commercial last night for  urlLink Valtrex , that new drug that is supposed to supress Herpes outbreaks. Ever seen an ad? Young and beautiful twentysomethings dance around a garden. They go sailboating and hiking. They run through parks flying kites or holding balloons. They splash around in a fountain. C'mon -- do you know any couples that actually do anything like that? I didn't think so. One would get the impression from repeated viewings that contracting a venereal disease is like holding a winning lottery ticket. Then I realized that I had finally got the message of the ad campaign:  "people with herpes have way more fun than the rest of us." It was so obvious that I don't know why I didn't see it before.  Man, I wish I had herpes!

      There's no doubt as to exactly WHEN it began.  It was the Academy Awards show of 1978.  There I was - a young movie fan totally prepped (Jiffy Pop popcorn and Coke ready to go!) for what SHOULD have been the coolest night of my life thus far!  ...But, alas, it was not meant to be.  From Innocent to Cynic in one fell swoop!  Oh sure...they tossed it a few bones.  Seems like they even had some sort of musical number with a few Stormtroopers thrown in or something.  But when "Star Wars" took home not ONE major Academy Award that night, my "Oscar Orneriness" began!  I mean...COME ON!  What was NOT to like about this stunning achievement in modern-day film?!?  "Star Wars" had it all...action, adventure, romance, intrigue, spirituality, awesome special effects, a fantastic musical score, etc., etc., etc.   I thought SURE it was a shoo-in for Best Picture, Best Director...some sort of BIG award.  But NOOOOOOOOOOO!  The best it could manage was to pick up a few 'scraps' thrown its way in the areas of technical achievement.  When my youthful hopes were crushed, I soon came to realize that the only films considered 'worthy' of Academy recognition were those that:  (a) were set in 18th or 19th century England, (b) were written or produced by Woody Allen - or any other accepted member of the Academy 'Intelligentsia", (c) starred Meryl Streep, (d) were the most serious type of DRAMA imaginable - usually involving someone suffering through a terminal illness, a terrible divorce, or a death in the family, or (e) featured some combination of the above!  It is with GREAT interest then that I try to put aside my long-held cynicism and look toward the upcoming Academy Awards night for 2004.  Is it possible that the Academy elite might actually consider "The Return Of The King" - one of the most powerful, thought-provoking, and thrilling films it has ever been my privilege to enjoy in the darkness of a completely 'Sold Out' theatre - for the Best Picture honors?    Only time will tell of course - but it appears that many of those 'in the know' think that it might actually happen!  Whodathunkit?  - A film that actually 'speaks to the masses' winning a Best Picture Oscar?!?  Maybe there IS still hope for the world of American Entertainment!  (Insert your own joke about the original "Star Wars" film being recently subtitled "A New Hope"!)

      With the Lenten Season approaching on Wednesday, I decided Tuesday afternoon that I would give up soda pop for Lent. You know, the whole "give those couple of bucks a week to charity" and "pray for the hungry when I was craving a Coke" sort of stuff. Anyways, I was driving back from Buffalo very late on Tuesday night and picked up a Pepsi at Kwik Fill. I noticed when I got back in the car that it was 12:00 am on Ash Wednesday. That plan lasted long!

      I had the opportunity a few years back to participate in a "Seven Habits of Highly Effective People" seminar. After a lot of reflection, I finished the week by preparing a personal mission statement. It doesn't so much reflect "what I want to do" as much as "who I want to be." A yellowing copy still hangs on the wall of my office, and I still refer to it from time to time when I get overwhelmed at the craziness of life. Here it is:  I want to be a Christian without being religious. I want to unlock that dusty sanctuary and let God out. I'll follow Him around to find out what He does on the other six days of the week. I'm gonna set aside a little time each day to intoxicate myself on the Person that likes making stuff like the harvest moon, zebras, thunderstorms and funny people like me. I want to know what it all means.  Wisdom has all the answers, but she doesn't give 'em up until you catch her. I'll start running smarter... I'll search for her in places that I used to pass by with a dismissive look. I'll dig for the elusive needle-in-the-haystack even though I know it'll probably cut me when I find it.  You see, truth is both comforting and scary at the same time. Pleasure, pain, history, misery, joy, jazz -- there's something to learn and pass along in each one, so I gotta drink it all down. The nourishment will work through my system and give me the strength to act in accordance with what I've learned.  My purpose is to communicate discerned truth to people in a way that they can understand... Sometimes with words, sometimes with pictures, but mostly be the way I treat them... What they do with the message is up to them, but I can always pray.  Finally, will I know that I am successful when the choices I've made during the day allow me to go to bed at night with a clear conscience before God and people.  August 15, 2000

      Dear Fox Network:  I just caught a TV promo for your newest show: THE GREAT AMERICAN SPELLING BEE!!! It sounds real entertaining, and I imagine it will go over better than your alternate plan of just pointing a camera at an aquarium for an hour.  If ideas are that hard to come by in Hollywood, I would like to offer my services as a television executive. I have a wonderful concept I want to discuss with you that would have the Fox Sports Team providing color commentary for the Pillsbury Bakeoff.  Describing your network programming as "a vast wasteland" sounds like I'm damning you with faint praise.  IAN  P.S. Hope you aren't planning on winning the February Sweeps.

      “There is nothing more to say – except why. But since why is difficult to handle, one must take refuge in how (p. 9).”  There are some stories that are so terrible, that hold so much hurt and loss that the how is what can be shared minus the why. Pecola was born to wounded parents, in a broken down house, after the last ember of love and warmth had died away. Sometimes you hear stories of what isolation can do to infants. If no one comes to care for his or her needs: being held fed and loved; the child languishes and dies. Pecola’s mother had to go back to work when she and her brother were young. Her father was there when he felt like it, but was drunk most of the time anyway. The home was ill attended to, and if her parents were there together they would fight. Glass flying, voices screaming, and all Pecola thought was…if I had blue eyes everything would be perfect.   It amazes me how children will absorb the chaos around them, excuse the violence around them, and say it wouldn’t happen if they were good, obedient or beautiful. That is such a lie. Children don’t choose whom they’re born to.  Pecola’s existence is one that astounds me. A girl like her, with a family life like hers’- how did she survive?  In a drunken stupor, her father sets fire to their ramshackle apartment because he wants everything to be over. The fire is extinguished, but the destructive power of her father’s rage is only stoked. As her mother tries to pull together a shabby household, Pecola leaves to stay with another family in town. This family isn’t rich. But there is a warm bed, milk to drink and two girls to be her “sisters”. For the first time Pecola has some semblance of a family, even if it is only for a few days.   Pecola has to use the survival skills she learned at home, to make it at school. Rumors about her father’s sexualized and drunken acts spread like wild fire, making her feel more ugly and lost than ever before. Her new “sisters” defend her from the mob of merciless children. But over time, the attacks become too rash for them to continue to provide.  Pecola finds friends where she can. She is particularly fascinated by the Fancy Ladies that live close by her salvaged apartment. She enjoys their songs and sass, although she is too naïve to understand their humor. They don’t tell her she is ugly and she doesn’t feel invisible in their presence.  Pecola is invisible at home. The house is more dead than alive. The only sign of life in it are her efforts to wash dishes or read in the corner of the room. He brother leaves home, as the atmosphere of death is too much for him to bear. Her father sees the clean dishes, read books and the reminder of long lost memories of love and Pecola’s mother. His anger, pity and fear culminate in his misdirected desire for his own daughter; for the life she holds. He rapes his twelve-year-old daughter on the floor of the kitchen. He gives her his death, he takes her life and he leaves.  Pecola’s mother ignores the terrible truth of what has happened, but she has finally received freedom from the chains of this sad man. Pecola is lost and still feels that if she were beautiful, all would be well in her life. She goes to see a Magician to ask him for blue eyes. The man is a fake and is entirely crazy, but he promises her blue eyes –beauty. She believes him, and the madness that infected the magician is passed to Pecola. Although there is no physical change, Pecola believes her eyes are blue. She has the bluest eyes.     Reality takes root and Pecola is found to be pregnant with her father’s baby, and she can no longer go to school. She feels that all the talk and stares are caused by jealousy over her wonderful eyes; instead of the stigma she carries within herself. The people in her town curse her and her baby, her mother pretends the rape never happened, her “sisters” are afraid to talk to her, and her Fancy Ladies disappear from her life. Pecola is now invisible to everyone.   Her baby comes too early and dies. News of her father’s death makes way back to town, but no one seems to care. Pecola has wrapped herself up into the fantasy of beauty and has no attachment to the world around her. Everything that motivates her is the assurance that she is beautiful. She spends her days wandering in the town dump, eating out of trash bins and dancing through the piles of rotting refuse. She could care less, because she has the bluest eyes in the world. She is beauty.   If Pecola had been born to another family, she wouldn’t have been christened ugly at birth. If her mother ‘d loved her for whom she was instead of what she looked like, her spirit would have had a chance to thrive. If her father would have given her bread instead of a stone, she could have had a life. If her community had reached out and held fast, she could have been transformed by their love. Pecola remains to be what her dim world made her: ugly in appearance, sick of mind, ill in spirit, sexually demonized by rape and wandering in the town dump. Like Hamlet, Pecola’s father dammed her to death before she had a chance to live. Madness and death are the “sisters” she now holds on to.   The Bluest Eye tells the “how” of Pecola’s life, the “why” is revealed by the people left to tell the rest of her story. The debt of violence, death and despair is too expensive for anyone to pay – even if they have the bluest eyes.

      Creating a life that is full of meaning is a challenge for each individual to achieve. Meaning is often represented by an individuals’ successful personal achievement. This success is often viewed through the glasses of academics, material belongings, social status or acquiring a well-rounded healthy psyche. There are many reasons many people never achieve this kind of marvelous life; poverty, personal disability and poor resources begin a long list of “could have been except…” reasons for little achievement in life.  Sarah and Elizabeth Delany were two black women that easily could have fit into the “could have been except…” category, but instead lived their days with sapless courage and determination. In their biography “Having Our Say”, Sadie and Bess speak honestly about the challenges of growing up and living life as black women during socially stressful and dangerous times. Both Sadie and Bess lived long lives filled with the experiences many of us can’t imagine, living to be over 100 years each. These women were born into post Civil War southern society in the late 1880’s to a former slave, black, and college-educated father; and a mulatto, college-educated mother.  The largest question posed by the Delany sisters was, “Is it more difficult to be black, or to be a woman in life?” Both women were raised to achieve all that they could in life and were expected to show great determination to gain a proper education. Persisting to achieve more in life sometime put Sadie and Bess in dangerous situations. Once Sadie was almost lynched because she talked back to a drunk, white man that entered the segregated train car and spoke coarsely to her. It seemed that before anything else, people attacked Sadie or Bess first because they were black and second because they were women in a world that wasn’t ready for them. Prejudice was found in unexpected places for Bessie as she recalls her graduation from Columbia University, “ I suppose I should be grateful to Columbia, that at that time they let me in but they beat me down for being there! I don’t know how I got through that place, except when I was young nothing could hold me back. No, sir! I thought I could change the world. It took me a hundred years to figure out I can’t change the world. I can only change Bessie. And, honey, that ain’t easy, either (p.114).”  Their story passes from their childhood, into early education, then their move to Harlem during the cultural awakening and then on to their days at Columbia University. Most individuals stop the process of learning in life. After they get their degree or dream job people often feel that they have done enough. Bess and Sadie continue to be student’s of life even after achieving their standard breaking careers, as the first black woman dentist and the first black woman high-school teacher in New York City. Education was the motivation that developed their minds and spirits, helping them to learn from life in any circumstance. Bess said, “ You see I still have the urge to change the world. The truth is, you’re born a certain way and there’s some things you can change, and some you can’t”(p.200). Education was something they could use to change themselves…and maybe the world.   Sadie and Bess lived through segregation, Negros and women gaining the vote, World War I, the Great Depression, World War II, integration, Vietnam, The Cold War, JFK and Martin Luther King’s assassination and many other pivotal historical events. But the most amazing thing to each of them is that they have lived beyond the limited reach of those people and ideas that tried to hold them back. Sadie exclaims, “ We’ve out lived those old rebby boys! That’s one way to beat them! That’s justice…Truth is, I never thought I’d see the day when people would be interested in hearing what two old Negro women have to say. Life still surprises me. So maybe the last laugh’s on me (p. 209).”  Sadie and Bess Delany tell their story of changing themselves in such a powerful way that I can’t help thinking they changed the way someone thought, reacted to or treated someone that was different than themselves. Prejudice is the like trying to see with a wool blanket over your head, it’s irritating and blinding. The Delany sisters pull the blanket of prejudice off of one hundred years by living with courage and determination. Sadie and Bess did more that change their lives; they changed mine by sharing their amazing story.

      A mysterious stone -- a religious artifact from the middle east -- is igniting controversy in Great Britain. Incredible rumors spread about the stone's magical properties, which include healing, travel through space and time, and telepathy.  If you haven't yet guessed, you're in  urlLink Charles Williams  territory again. This time the subject is his second novel,  urlLink Many Dimensions , first published in 1931. This book differs greatly from my introduction to Williams, the complex and dense Descent Into Hell, as it is a much more straightforward, almost breezy, read. The book is filled with witty, well-defined characters and a storyline that begs a reader to keep turning the pages.  It is revealed that the stone is composed of "first matter" -- the original matter that God called into existence at the creation. The stone was entrusted to King Solomon, who referred to the stone as "The End of Desire." But mankind, in its fallen state, has its heart set on many desires. Some people want to use the stone for good (such as healing people or improving intelligence), but the object has been consecrated for Holy purposes, which goes even beyond our notions of "good." Debates over the correct use of the stone causes unexpected conflict between common people. Even worse is the desire of the government and big business to exert power and control over an object that they simply do not understand. Using the stone for evil ends leads to calamitous results. Everyone desires the stone, but few desire the One who gives the stone its power.  Charles Williams books can be hard to find, which is a shame because I simply could not put this book down. Here's hoping that someday soon he'll get the recognition he deserves and find a place on bookstore shelves with C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien.

      I received the sad news yesterday that my Aunt Evelyn passed away. She was the last of my family's large number of great aunts and uncles. It's impossible for me to sift my memories of her apart from her large white country house and sprawling property because I so very rarely saw her anywhere else. Lebby, as she was known by everyone, opened up her big yard to the rest of the family for any and all occasions: Labor Day, 4th of July, Memorial Day, graduations, and any birthdays that were lucky enough to fall in the warm weather months. I wonder how many bonfires, sparklers, and rounds of Jarts and croquet were enjoyed over the decades? Those lazy days were much more than picnics, though. They provided us with a way of staying connected as a family.  You didn't go to Lebby's house because you received an invitation. You went to Lebby's house because you belonged. People would just drift in over the course of the day, even if only for an hour or two. And it was O.K. to bring a member of your extended family, or a friend, or a girlfriend. As I get older I appreciate more and more her rare gift of hospitality.  Lebby never had children of her own. But you would never guess it, from the warmth and kindness that she showed to all of us kids. She never displayed the impatience of someone who expects children to be little adults -- quite the contrary, she was the type of grownup that had the ability to converse with young people in a genuine and authentic way. We all mattered to Aunt Lebby.  So it was in a rather somber mood that my children, my mother, and I took a drive around Chautauqua Lake to see the Ice Castle. Every year we somehow miss the winter festival itself, but manage to at least take the trek to Mayville to appreciate the community's handiwork before it melts away. The temperatures were in only in the 30s, but it felt warm after our recent bitter temperatures. The sunshine had already eroded away the detail at some of the ice sculptures, obscuring the artist's intent. But the Ice Castle itself was still standing bold against the panorama of the lake. A green-blue light shone through its walls in the most strangely beautiful way. My mom and I took turns photographing the castle. She commented that it would all be gone in a month and we would only have the photographs left to admire.   And it needs to be so. Winter will soon give way to the Spring. And Spring will bring with it something much better -- green grass, flowers, warm breezes, and sunshine.   In the same way, Aunt Evelyn's passing is really her transition into the springtime of her life. She has taken up residence in a new homestead with a new yard. For the first time, she's the one walking into a family gathering already in progress. And she's basking in the hospitality of the One who loves us all.

      It doesn't take too long when you look into the lives of infamous or famous individuals before “stories” emerge with tales of sacrifice and challenge. There are stories of actors struggles to make it onto Broadway, politicians who finally win their campaign for office and writers that finally get published.  I would like to suggest that the true essence of every individual's story is not found in the remembrance of their “glory days” or in the cumulative fruit of their labor.  The most poignant stories come from an individual's daily execution and pursuit of their hopes, skills and dreams. So much of our life’s value is based upon the bottom line that often we miss the point of the creative act altogether.   The joy and purpose of creating something is not in accessing the material value of a created work; but in the act of creating and expressing a thought or idea - even if no one ever sees the creation.  I feel our society can either overstimulate the ego of the creative individual by funneling their efforts into profit in lieu of purpose.  Because our society is more interested in the marketability of what is created opposed to the act of creating; critics often trample the enthusiasm and efforts of the creative individual.  Criticism often stalls and often stops the creative efforts of many individuals, because they are told it is foolish to work on something that holds no material value.  When you apply this idea to anyone’s life and work ethic, how much of our motivation is based upon material reward and the expectations of others?  While critics and society do play a part in creative effort, the final responsibility and motivation falls upon the individual who desires to create. In her book, “A Circle of Quiet”, Madeleine L'Engle says that true creativity occurs when the individual acts outside self and selfconsciousness and wholly concentrates on the act of creating and fully participates in the act by taking an investigative and childlike approach to creating.    The key to understanding and approaching any creative project begins when we look at it through the eyes of a child. A child doesn’t consider the value of a sandcastle before he builds it, or wonder if a song makes sense before he sings it; the child builds his castle because he wants to make it, and he makes up a songs because he wants to sing it. Many people are paralyzed to create anything simply because they‘ve forgotten how to play.   As a child, I remember how I could escape my home, family and even myself when I would play with my crayons, Barbies and a tape recorder.  Once when I was in Kindergarten, I remember spending an entire Sunday afternoon playing with the hair of one particular doll. She had a hair extension that made it easy to create unending options for fabulous hairdos. I gave her pigtails first because that is what I wore, and then I took that out. I tied it like a hair band  so she looked like Alice in Wonderland. Then I decided to do something with Barbie hair that had never been done before. I was going to create something new. I twisted and tied her hair this way and that. I teased, fluffed and tucked her hair into the most extravagant “up do” that my six year old mind could muster. My plain blond Barbie had been transformed into the most elegant doll on the face of the planet... at least to me.   There was no way that I could let the rest of the people in my world live out the day without seeing my wonderful creation. My sister thought it was neat, my brother just grunted at me, my Dad said it was nice, but my Mom gave me a great idea. She told me that if I was very careful, I could take my doll to school for show-and-tell on Monday. I was so excited. My Mom had never let me take a Barbie to school before. I must have done something really amazing with doll hair for my Mom to let me do this. So I packed her in a soft hand towel, wrapped her in something to keep her from getting wet and put her safely in my bag for school. Before I left for school the next morning, my Mom told me something very wise. “Keep your doll in your bag until you get to school and it’s time for show and tell. You don’t want anything to happen to her hair.”   Walking with a hop in my step and swinging my blue bag with my name on it, I proudly climbed aboard my bright yellow bus with a huge smile. I remember thinking that day was going to be great.   It was great. I told my friends what was in my bag. I told them that they would have to wait to show and tell and that it was going to knock their socks off!   J-- was sitting in front of me and she had been listening to my conversation with great interest. She was in first grade and usually was rather nasty to everyone, especially to little kindergarten girls with long brown pigtails. Today for some reason, she thought I was really cool. I was rather impressed. If this was what hairstyling skills can do for a person, I was gonna be set for life.   Things were going great, until J-- asked to see my doll. If I said yes, she might be nice to me. If I said no, she probably would pull my pigtails. I took a chance. I took my doll out of my bag, out of my water tight wrap, and out of the dishtowel. J-- seemed somewhat impressed and smiled as she asked to “hold” my doll. I had already blown off my Mom’s advice not to show the doll and that was risky enough. Now I was in an unexpected, insecure situation. What to do.  As I pondered what to do, J-- yanked the doll from my hands, ripped the fluffy wig off of her head and screamed, “ This is what I think your stupid doll!”. As she stomped the hair extension under her stinky, untied sneaker and into the tracks of the sticky, muddy floor of Bus number #5, I was dazed, angry, and shocked.  I was somehow able to get my doll out of her rough, clenched hands and pick up the soggy wig before she did any permanent damage. I held my tongue, at least for the last four minutes of the bus ride. But when I got to school and saw  my teacher, my tears began to fall as I retold the horrible story. I don’t remember what happened to my doll or what happened to J--.  I did remember that even if you make something you think is great, someone else may still hate it.  In the passing of time, I realize the best lesson to remember from this nasty little story should be that my focus shouldn't’t have been on what my family, teacher or even what J-- thought of me or my doll. My focus got off track when I became selfconscious about what I had created. In the end, I didn't’t stop playing with my doll’s hair. I did stop looking to the critics for the value in what I created and I kept on playing.    The act of creating can be art. By using words, numbers, colors and actions; lives can be encouraged, dreams can be realized, and the imagination can be freed to go and play - all for the sake of playing.  The act of creating can be like prayer. When you pray you speak what is on your heart and mind. You focus all your attention, concentration, and hope into words free of pride and criticism - all for the sake of a prayer.  Creating can be like loving someone. You support the person you love with understanding, loyalty, and hope; giving of yourself because you can’t help but to give - all for the sake of love.   Living a life that allows the freedom of creative thought provides every human with the ability to be and become their true ontological self. People can pursue and develop gifts that would have been dismissed or discarded, if the motivation is to enjoy the process of play. Creativity enables every persons’ life story to be shared without needing to be the center of the world it is shared with.   So let the musician play, even if there is no audience. Let the writer write, even if there is no publisher waiting in the wings.   Take out your dolls and try to create a new hairdo. Don’t be afraid to dance at your next wedding reception. Open your box of colors. Look at the names on the crayon wrappers and smell the pages of  your coloring books. Let creativity free you to create an amazing life, not just amazing things. Create a life full of Barbie dolls, art, wedding polkas, prayer, love and crayon colored pictures on your refrigerator... all for the sake of playing.

      A radio revolution is taking place in a musty little basement in Salt Lake City. It is there in a makeshift studio that "Donovan" and "Premium Deluxe" put together Vinyl Cobwebs, a weekly internet program devoted to playing "obscure oldies all the time."   In an era where radio stations refuse to take listener requests but then pay thousands of bucks to consultants to tell them what listeners want to hear, the DJ–driven Vinyl Cobwebs is a real anachronism.  Culling playlists from nearly 10,000 obscure vinyl records rescued from local thrift stores, Vinyl Cobwebs treats its fans to the best rhythm and blues, rock, soul, psychedelia and novelty records that they've never heard. That's what keeps people from as far away as Australia and China downloading the program each and every week.  I.F. recently caught up with music and comedy mastermind Donovan to discuss broadcasting, oddball humor, and how a creepy Colonel Sanders mask purchased on eBay inspired an underground movie.  I.F.: There’s not a place in North America where you can’t find an oldies station or two on the radio dial. Why put a show on the internet?  Donovan: First and foremost, 99% of every oldies broadcast station is consultant driven, meaning that they are geared towards making money thru advertising, etc.  They are limited or "handicapped" as we call it, to playing a limited set of tunes that are deemed worthy by the listening public.  This includes only the remembered hits. To sustain a show of obscure oldies we found no other avenue but to put it on the internet.  No corporate oldies stations would take a chance on our eclectic format.    I.F.: Any college kid with a nose ring and a CD collection feels qualified to gripe about the radio industry. But you guys actually know what you’re talking about -- you have legitimate broadcast backgrounds.  Donovan: Legitimate! (laughs) I guess you could say so... I worked for several years here in Salt Lake City back in the early 90s for KTKK and KCNR, both talk stations. Premium also did some stints at community radio playing his brand of oldies but goodies.  I.F.: What do you enjoy best about being on the internet?  Donovan: The fact that we have don't have a program director! Total freedom. We can just let loose, play whatever we feel like playing, say whatever we feel like saying... That's what makes Vinyl Cobwebs so great. There's no real formula, just two guys spinning what we call "the platters that matter."  I.F.: How has the internet community reacted?  Donovan: We've received quite a lot of praise over the craziness and wackiness of the whole format of the show. We've also had some insulting e-mail in regards to our lame antics and characters on the show.  But we love those insulting e-mails almost more than the praise! The funny thing is that 90% of the nay sayers keep e–mailing back every week, so we know they're still listening!  I.F.: It must be like a car wreck... They can't look away...  Donovan: Yeah, right. Some listeners complain weekly, yet they've been on board for years!  I.F.: Oddball humor and hip old records aren’t the first things that come to my mind when I think of Salt Lake City. What’s it like living in the backyard of the Latter Day Saints?  Donovan: Maybe the whole obscure oldies trip we're on comes from living in a strange environment. Utah has a very strong counterculture, and we feel that might contribute to our strange and sometimes devious humor on the show. Everyone has this crazy idea that people in Utah, particularly Mormons, live like the old Quakers of yesteryear. But in reality they drive cars, have electricity and some of them even drink booze! Shocking!  I.F.: Your creative partnership with Premium Deluxe has expanded beyond the radio program. Tell me about your first film venture, Wun Blee Chun Dee.  Donovan: The film follows the plight of a 40 year-old man living with his parents who has a nightmare where a mentally challenged indian gives him his indian name -- WUN BLEE CHUNG DEE! He discovers that this holy name means "heart of a chicken" and embarks on a journey as the Chicken Man -- in a Colonel Sanders mask -- to lead all believers unto the Lord!  I.F.: I'm speechless! Did you ever wonder if you were taking the humor too far?  Donovan: I've never thought that things could go too far! What makes film making fun for me is pushing the envelope. My criteria is that if something makes someone laugh, then it's funny! It doesn't matter how politically incorrect it may be deemed! I've always loved bizarre and b-movie stuff like John Waters and David Lynch films.    I.F.: Joe Bob Briggs would be proud.  Donovan: When we first showed the film at the Utah Media Arts Festival, we saw first hand how some folks were uncomfortable with some of the footage, especially the blackface scene we included. Yet some folks were rolling in the aisles. I guess it just depends on what kind of outlook you have on life.  I.F.: Did any professional media critics see the film?  Donovan: I don't think there's anything "professional" about the Utah Media Arts Fest! It's one of the cheesiest amateur film fest showings around! So no real "media critics" had the opportunity to lambast the film. But reaction from the audience was wild. Love it or hate it, people always had something to say about it.  I.F.: Were you making a statement about religion and race or just being silly?  Donovan: IF a statement exists among the content of Wun Blee Chun Dee, you can find it if you have an open mind.  I.F.: ?  Donovan: Actually, I've never liked it when anyone, including movie makers, story writers, song writers, etc. goes out and insist that you understand their message. It's all up to the listener or viewer. What they make of it is what they make of it... How's that for avoiding the question? I should be a politician!  I.F.: Or a member of the Salt Lake Olympic bid committee!  Donovan: --  I.F.: When should our readers expect to see Wun Blee Chun Dee at their local movieplex?  Donovan: (laughs uncontrollably) How's that for an answer? It  should be left among the wasteland of movie wastelands. However good or bad it may be, it's meant to stay underground.  I want it to stay underground.  I.F.: You guys are really on a creative roll with the weekly radio show and your first movie. Where would you like to see the Vinyl Cobwebs empire end up?  Donovan: I believe that Vinyl Cobwebs will be appreciated more when it's gone. You know, how the old artists never were truly appreciated until they died. They never got to see their paintings sell for millions of dollars. I hope someday 40 or 50 years from now, someone somehow will be shopping in a thrift store and be intrigued by a copy of Wun Blee Chun Dee they come across in a dusty old bin of stuff or maybe find a Vinyl Cobwebs show on CD.  I.F.: The same way you and Premium came across most of the gems you play on your program.  Donovan: Or try this scenario on for size... A consultant-driven radio station discovers that people want to hear more than Surfin' Safari for the millionth time and decides to syndicate Vinyl Cobwebs for all to hear!  I.F.: So mote it be!  Donovan: It would be great to wake up some of the stale music radio stations that salt and pepper this terrestrial earth!  I.F.: Are you ever concerned about the recording industry killing off the internet radio community just like they polished off Napster?  Donovan: Not really. The industry is more interested in killing the big guy than dealing with hobbycasters like Vinyl Cobwebs. That's why I love the fact that our show, our movies and our lives will stay in the small time underground. There are people out there who don't want us to sell out. Those are Vinyl Cobwebs kind of people!  I.F.: To a lot of your fans, you guys are like “the little DJs that could.” What advice would you give to those poor souls who feel stifled working in the communications industry?  Donovan: First -- poor baby, you feel stifled! Second, never do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. If you are unhappy, get the fuck out!  Curious about Vinyl Cobwebs? Then point your web browser to  urlLink www.vinylcobwebs.freeservers.com  to downloaded this week's program in convenient mp3 format files or  urlLink www.live365.com/stations/215676  to listen to an 24 hour a day streaming webcast.

      One would get the impression from my recent blog posts that all I do is read books by Christian Mystics. So I thought that I would dispel that myth by reviewing some comic books.  The Marvel Essentials series is a cheap way for people like me to buy back my childhood. Each edition reprints about 500 pages of the early years of Marvel Comics in one convenient paperback book. One drawback is that the reprints are in black and white, but what do you expect for fifteen bucks?   urlLink The Essential Incredible Hulk Volume 1  collects a few dozen of Ol' Greeny's early appearances in Marvel Comics between 1962 to 1967. That's really not a lot of output for a character that has become one of the most iconic in the Marvel stable of characters. A little bit of comics trivia for you -- the original run of the Hulk was cancelled after just 6 scanty issues. The Hulk was kept alive through guest appearances in other mags until he landed a steady gig as a co-feature with Giant Man and Sub-Mariner in Tales to Astonish. It wasn't until 1968 or so that sales warranted the Not-so-Jolly Green Giant getting his own book again.  This book is probably the best evidence as to why it took so long for the Hulk to move into the limelight. (Sorry about that last pun.) While the Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde meets Frankenstein premise seems straightforward enough, it seems like writer Stan Lee didn't really have a handle on the direction the series should take. For instance, is the Hulk a hero or monster? Some stories have him saving humanity only as a byproduct of his own selfish actions. Other issues portray Bruce Banner intentionally turning into the Hulk to fight crime, ala Batman or something.  And how does Bruce transform into the Hulk anyhow? The first few issues seem to indicate in the best horror movie fashion that the metamorphosis happens at sundown. Others show the "don't make me angry" schtick familiar to TV viewers. And for a run of a few issues, Bruce uses a gamma ray device that he built to change back and forth at will.  Much of the book is made up of stories culled from Tales to Astonish in which the Hulk only made up half the comic. The shorter page count doesn't lend itself to what Marvel did best -- developing characters and fantastic story arcs. Unlike Spider-Man, it's hard to get involved in the lives of the cast of characters. It's hard to sympathize with an anti-hero like the Hulk, and the military base setting just seems too far removed from real life as opposed to the New York setting of most of the other Marvel characters. Sometimes the Hulk appears to have Banner's mind and an antisocial chip on his shoulder, sometimes he just appears dumb.    The inconstancy finds its way into the artwork as well. It seems as if the whole bullpen handled the penciling at one time or another, including Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and Bill Everett. Some artists only drew one issue, which leads to a lack of consistency in the look of the supporting cast of characters.  I'd recommend passing on this one. If you want to take a look at Marvel Comics in its prime, check out the Spider-Man or Fantastic Four Essentials instead.

      If you've followed my previous posts, I've already told you about why we went to visit the seminary, our adventures dodging SUVs to get there, our tour, and where to get a good cup of coffee in Suffern. This post is intended to describe my experience of Saturday evening and Sunday morning.  T-- had gone into NYC to visit Times Square. I decided to stick close to the hotel for the evening break. Although I had thus far enjoyed the weekend, there is only so much socializing I can do in a big group before I need to draw away by myself. I took a shower, read my Bible, and prayed for my family and friends a few hundred miles away.  I spent a lot of time in thought about full-time service and ordination. After all, I'm already doing most of the work and getting none of the perks, I liked the seminary, I love school in general, I have no financial reasons not to go, the seminary had good facilities with kids in mind, my wife desperately wants to go, I met and got on well with many of my potential classmates, and everyone says my wife and I would make great clergy. All pluses, right? Sign me up right now!  Try as I did to psych myself into going to school this fall, I just didn't feel any assurance that this was the right move for me to make. (Note: When I write "assurance" I'm writing about something more than a gut feeling. What I mean is something more mystical, in other words, an inner assurance of the Holy Spirit that I was making the right decision.)  T-- was still in NYC at 9 pm, so I went to the evening meeting by myself.  urlLink McNair Wilson , a former Disney Imagineer and art director for  urlLink The Wittenburg Door , was performing his one man show, From Up Here. Using just a ladder, a rumpled scrap of paper, and his own imagination, McNair dramatized a number of stories from the Bible in this witty show. Combining religion and humor can be a risky proposition, and I've seen it done badly before, eliciting more groans than laughs from the audience. McNair held our group of 300-plus people spellbound for his entire show. The hour zipped by way too quickly.  After the play, McNair spoke a few brief words to the audience. He said something to the effect that he had long ago decided that he had to be himself, because if he wasn't true to who God created him to be, he was keeping God's creation from being complete. In just one sentence, McNair crystallized what I had been feeling all weekend. The blunt truth is that being an ordained member of the clergy isn't me. And strangely enough, that realization was accompanied by a strange and wonderful assurance.  Sunday morning was the biggest Salvation Army meeting in which I had ever taken part. One of the things I love about the Sallyann is the clarity of preaching, because its more used to talking to regular people than theologians and scholars. Commissioner Lawrence Moretz held to that tradition as he delivered the message, "Ministry -- It's high, It's holy, It's hard."  So that's the way I found myself "Suffern the Weekend Away" on February 6 - 8, 2004. I gave the call to ministry an honest shot. I absolutely loved the seminary but at the same time didn't feel like that was the path laid out before me.

      I helped D-- and his mom move into their new apartment today. I'm not sure how much help I was, considering I'm still getting over the flu and didn't have my natural verve.  D-- has gone through the wringer over these last few years. It's all too personal to share in a public blog like this, suffice to say that if I wrote his experiences in a short story you would assume that it was all too outlandish and melodramatic to be true.  It's nice to see how good he's doing now. He finally has a decent paying job, has gone back to school and is doing great, and has a nifty new apartment. I sincerely hope that the next few years of success will outweigh his recent trials.  I'm crossing my fingers that he doesn't break a mirror in transport!

      I just won a free song in the Pepsi/iTunes promotion! Okay, so it wasn't like I won the Publisher's Sweepstakes or anything, but I hardly ever win anything. (I once won a day-glo lunchbox at school and a copy of The Gospel Reloaded from the  urlLink HollywoodJesus  website. Other than that, I'm a real Schleprock!)  How cool. All I had to do was open up my iTunes player, click on the store and enter in the code that was printed inside the bottle cap. The store allowed me to search under artist, song title or album title, and even would play a 30-second preview of each song. After much indecision I finally settled on "Are You Gonna Be My Girl" by Jet. The song was even downloaded straight to my iTunes music folder, which is located on an external hard drive. This is why I love Apple -- they make everything so simple to use.  The promotion is pure genius. I'm an old-stick-in-the-mud that wants something tangible in my hands, like a CD and artwork, but the freebie convinced me to try the service. I'll admit it -- I'm hooked. The instant gratification of clicking my mouse and owning the song. Also, I could really grow to like the idea of picking just the songs I like, rather than sinking twenty bucks on a whole CD. (For instance, I would never have purchased the whole Jet album.)    I gotta tell ya: considering the ease of use, selection, and low price of 99¢ a song, Steve Jobs may have invented something that will prove to be way more addictive than crack!  P.S. The whole "tangibility" thing was an issue with me a few years back when I switched from traditional video editing to using a nonlinear system. It took me awhile to shake the anxiety of turning off a computer that contained my whole day's work without seeing the reassuring presence of a videotape on the shelf!

      Sometimes someone else's words can express my feelings better than I can express them myself. This comes from the pen of  urlLink Thomas Merton , a Catholic Monk, Christian Mystic, and poet. It's from his book Thoughts on Solitude.  A PRAYER  MY LORD GOD, I have no idea where I am going.  I do not see the road ahead of me.  I cannot know for certain where it will end.  Nor do I really know myself, and the fact that I think that I am following your will does not mean that I am actually doing so.   But I believe that the desire to please you does in fact please you.  And I hope I have that desire  in all that I am doing.  I hope that I will never do anything  apart from that desire.   And I know that if I do this you will lead me by the right road  though I may know nothing about it.  Therefore will I trust you always  though I may seem to be lost  and in the shadow of death.  I will not fear,  for you are ever with me, and you will never leave me  to face my perils alone.

      Will someone please tell me when staying home sick became a bad thing? I remember what a blast it was as a grade-school student. At the slightest cough or sniffle my mom would swing into action. Extra pillows, some Vicks Vapor-Rub, lime Jello, and free refills on the Canada Dry. My father, who normally detested my predilection of all things science-fiction, would even stop at the B & B Smokeshop and buy me some comic books. The big softie. I really hit the jackpot when my older sister had to babysit -- I could always wait for her to go down to the basement to smoke (a big no-no in our household) and then sneak into the living room and whittle away the day watching TV. The only loose end to tie up came the next day and it easy: handing my teacher the note from my mom that said, "Please excuse Ian for being ill."  Contrast that Nirvana with the adult sick day. The day begins at 8 am by calling in to the office. I dread this part. I was raised in a strict Pentecostal church until I was eighteen, which causes me TO FEEL GUILTY ABOUT LYING EVEN WHEN I'M TELLING THE TRUTH. Then people want to know from which meetings I will be absent. And everyone knows that I'm only a phone call away. In fact, dozens of coworkers with whom I've never spoken suddenly call me up to "touch base" about some "project" so I can be "in the loop." It is now 8:03.  Coming down with Scarlet Fever seemed like a perfectly reasonable trade-off for getting some time off at Pleasant Township Elementary School. It was "me time." I believe Steven Covey would classify it as "sharpening the ax." All I think about now are the things I need to accomplish when I get back to my office. (I actually dreamt I was in a budget meeting as I dozed in bed this afternoon. No kidding.)   And don't even get me started about the lack of Jello. You know who gets to dote on ol' I.F. as an adult? That's right, the guy looking back at him through the mirror. No mommy or daddy appearing on the horizon to get me to the doctor, so I might as well lay in bed and die. Not that I'm pouting, you understand...   The social interaction of being a sick adult is a bust. But the physiological factors aren't gravy either. I had all the "biggies" as a kid: the above-mentioned Scarlet Fever, Chicken Pox, Strep Throat, Influenza, and everyone's favorite, Diarrhea. But no matter how high my temperature, no matter how achey or painy, no matter what part of my body was expelling fluid, I can't ever recall feeling miserable as a child. My pet theory is that my elementary school body must have been so "showroom fresh" that it even felt good to barf.  P.S. One more sick story before I pass. One time when I was sick with a sore throat, my teenage sister insisted that it must be mono. When I got back to school a few days later, I got mixed up and told my third-grade teacher I was out with a venereal disease!

      Here's a blurb from the latest edition of  urlLink Sojomail :  Sundance Film Festival documentary award-winner  urlLink Super Size Me: A Film of Epic Proportions  follows the life of 30-year-old Morgan Spurlock during a month-long self-inflicted binge on McDonalds. For 30 days Spurlock, director, producer, and human guinea pig, had to eat everything on the menu at least once and if he was asked to "super size" it he was obligated to do so. All the while Spurlock was visiting three doctors (a cardiologist, gastroenterologist, and a general practitioner) to monitor his health. At the end of 30 days he had packed on almost 30 pounds, his cholesterol skyrocketed from 165 to 230, and his liver had become so damaged it became "toxic."  urlLink Super Size Me: A Film of Epic Proportions  is being shown in limited cities across the U.S.

      B is for bully, who rigs a fight. B is for bawdy, uncouth with delight. B is for bitterness, bundled up tight. B is for brilliant, for dark not light.  B is for boxy, cold and restrained. B is for battery, hatred unchained. B is for buffoon, sweaty and loud. B is for bastard, unlimited and proud.  B is for beautiful, butterfly or bless. But this kind of B has nothing to do with the rest. A bully, so bawdy, with bitterness so brilliant. (I don’t want anything to with all this B-ness.)  Your boxy, battery and buffoon-like behavior;  Makes me wonder if you ever wanted a savior.  B is for bastard, this suits you so well. This B describes the life you lead – You’re the extension of Hell.

      The bulk of last Friday and Saturday was spent touring the grounds and participating in seminars at the college. It was nice to catch up with so many people T-- and I have met over the last five years and make some new acquaintances, too.  Being a seminary and all, our opening session on Saturday morning had a worship band. It featured an -- uh, shall we say "interesting" bass player. While the rest of the band played the worship standard, "Lord I Lift Your Name On High," the bass player was perfectly content to plunk away on the bass line from "The Joker" by Steve Miller Band. I was hoping that the next song would be "Shout to the Lord" to the tune of "Fly Like an Eagle," but no such luck. The best part of the set came when a band member's jacket fell on the floor and the bassist stopped playing in the middle of the song, walked across the platform, picked up and carefully folded the jacket, set it down on top of a monitor, and finally schlumped back to the rest of the band to finish the song. (I found out later that he was a last minute replacement for the band's regular bassist. Good thing!)  We also had the good fortune of knowing our host couple, with who we shared our meals and received a tour of the campus via the local Starbucks. It was great visiting, but I did have a strange sense of deja vu being led around from classroom to classroom. It finally occurred to me that I had done something very similar thirty years previous during Kindergarten Roundup!  T-- and myself love school and really enjoyed sitting in the sample classes at the colleges. There was just something very charming about the two of us sharing a classroom, although she was the one who carried my books around! Actually we missed out on a great deal of the classroom instruction as a faulty fire alarm necessitated evacuations of the building three times on Saturday.  The wide-eyed innocence of kindergarten roundup coupled with the high-school highjinks of false alarms -- now that's what I call a well-rounded educational experience!

      I forgot to mention that we saw the craziest thing on our trip. There was a SUV parked halfway up a considerable snow bank. It was so unbalanced that a snowflake could have landed on the driver's side and flipped the whole thing on it's roof. It wasn't like the parking lot at Outback Steakhouse was full or anything. It was just like someone decided that they wanted to park as close as possible to the restaurant. Silly driver. I realize that commercials show SUVs doing impossible things like driving up a sheer cliff face, sloshing through raging rivers, or flying through hyperspace. But precariously perching one side of a vehicle on a giant snowbank is just a bad idea, no matter what impression Madison Avenue has given you!

      It just occurred to me that I never mentioned why I went to NYC in the first place. The obvious reason was that we were driving and being chaparones to a group of high school students and young adults who wanted to learn more about service in The Salvation Army. But the other reason was so T-- and I could devote some intensive time to exploring a call to full-time service. We already pastor a small church, but aren't ordained ministers. If we continue along this path, it's something that we'll have to take care of sooner or later. The two additional years of education would help, too!  Full-time Christian service isn't a career, it's a lifelong vocation. It's not something you choose out of a book of careers -- it's something that God chooses you for. The church talks a lot about the word "calling," which is more than common sense, or even desire to help people. A calling to ministry is an inner prompting from God to that specific work. So we took a few days to get away from all the busyness and noise of life to... listen...

      T-- and I spent last Friday driving out to a weekend at  urlLink The Salvation Army's seminary in Suffern , just outside of New York City. Wouldn't you know it, the weather conspired to make it one of the worst days for driving, ever. It warmed up just enough to rain, and then turned to ice. It added an additional two hours to what is normally a 6-hour drive. We saw 7 accidents on the way there, including a semi-tractor trailer on its side.  We were suffering from a definite shortage of Fahrvergnügen.  18-Wheelers used to draw our scorn, especially in bad weather. But the new object of our disaffection is the Sport Utility Vehicle. What is it about these big metal boxes that turn soccer moms and young urban professionals into behaving like they're tank-driving Soviet stormtroopers putting down student dissidents in Czechoslovakia?  We observed a lot of SUVs passing on the inside lane, driving way too fast for conditions, and following other drivers too closely in an attempt to speed them up or convince them to move to another lane. Hey SUV owners! What is it that causes you to be in such a bigger hurry than the rest of us? Is your life that much more exciting and eventful than other mortals? Are you so important and integral to the scheme of things at work that your boss makes you show up 15 minutes earlier than the rest of your coworkers? Or is it possible that you're as human as the rest of us, with the exception of an extra-small bladder, and T-- and I are just misinterpreting your frantic attempts to find the nearest rest stop as uncharitable commuting behavior?  Probably not.  Hey SUV owners! You have no right to get churlish with other drivers even if your vehicle cost more than their entire home. Remember that you own a rapidly depreciating vehicle, not the whole friggin' road!

      Here are the ingredients for quick spaghetti: Tomato sauce, ground meat, various herbs and spices, pasta and a group of hungry people.   I guess the magic happens when you invite people to share the "quick spaghetti". It's the mixture of taste, smell and creative individuals that make a dinner so common, so uncommon.  We asked a few co-workers over tonight on the spur of the moment and with "quick spaghetti" as the main dish - it was the best meal ever. (I'm not saying that because I cooked either.)  Color, warmth, laughter and relaxation. On a chilly February night, the meal we shared became a form of therapy for our family and friends.   It was unexpected, but familiar. The company was family and people we work with everyday, but we learned something new about each person. The two girls - H and Y both 10, got to spend some giggle time eating by themselves at the small kitchen table. They felt comfortable, excited and grown up for the independence of their special seating arrangment. The youngest - N (7) was happy to eat his pasta and bounce between the "grown-ups", "girls" and "the game cube". The grown-ups, L, R, I and T shared stories about family, adventures from when we were young, and concerns for today and tomorrow. The moment was imperfect and unpredictable, but it was perfect and peaceful just the same. It felt like home and it was magical.   Many times I used to pass by opportinities for "Quick Spaghetti" nights, because of the clutter of daily living and my fear of missing the mark. You know what? I don't care about the mark anymore. Martha Stewart dosen't live with me, but if she want to come over for quick spaghetti, salad from a bag and french bread and cake bought from the local grocery store, she's welcome at my house. Because "quick spaghetti" is magic.

      I finally fulfilled one of my life-long ambitions: I read a Charles Williams novel! Now maybe this doesn't seem like an earth-shattering event to you, but considering that Mr. Williams is frequently out-of-print and I am frequently out-of-cash, just purchasing the book was a big step in my self-actualization.  Williams was a contemporary of C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, although his works have never proved as popular as his more-famous friends'. The book, Descent Into Hell, has a much darker tone than anything this side of Narnia or Middle Earth.   Did I just type "darker tone"? I meant DOWNRIGHT SCARY. To Williams, the "spiritual world"” coexists --and quite often collides -- with this physical realm. Spirits roam freely over Battle Hill. A young woman meets her doppelganger to unexpected consequences. A man chooses the embrace of succubus to the uncertainty of a real relationship. The book examines the greatest of all loves -- laying down your life for another's -- and its opposite, the state of being so self-centered that you can no longer love or be loved.  Descent Into Hell isn't an easy read. Williams' prose almost comes off like poetry, and the many references to myth and legend had me reaching for the encyclopedia more than once. The novel jumps back and forth in time and space without giving obvious cues. But the experience was worth the challenge and I look forward to tracking down his other works at used bookstores.

      What can I say about March 2004 other than it was unpredictable? We experienced some nice weather early on and I convinced myself that spring had arrived --  urlLink Punxsutawney Phil  be darned -- which made it all the harder when the snow came back with a vengeance. The shell game with the weather was so typical of my experiences over the last few weeks. Just when I had decided on something, circumstances tossed everything around. I would arrange an evening with friends or a field trip with the family, only to have someone come down sick or have car problems at the last moment. It was a month when I had to roll with the punches, and I have the bruises to prove it...  The church is going great. It's amazing to see what a caring community this group of people have developed into. Even when things had me so stressed out, like new programs handed down by my denomination or conducting my first funeral, people from the church rose to occasion and saved my butt. That's why I got so depressed when hints kept getting dropped that there were "painful changes coming in September." But T-- and I had the opportunity to sit down with some of the leaders on the statewide level who assured us that closing down the ministry has never been discussed, and that a change like that can't be implemented by a leader on the local level. It was a great relief for me personally, and helped lift the depression I've been under.   In between every single member of my family coming down with the flu, I did manage to sneak out a few times. I saw  urlLink The Passion of the Christ . Liked the movie, hated the hype surrounding it. Went to  urlLink Freeway Church  and had a great time, as always.  Thank God for good friends. March would have been unbearable without 'em. V--, J-- #1, and J-- #2 always seemed to show up at the office and take me out to lunch just when I needed it most.  urlLink Mister Magical Surprise , the blogger who never blogs, even showed up for a quick visit from Vermont, so we could talk about the important things in life -- like DVDs and  urlLink Doctor Who . And B-- kept me entertained with his dispatches from internet cafes scattered around Israel, Turkey, and a place I couldn't find in my atlas called Urgup!  I've never owned a WWJD bracelet, but if I did, the last 31 days would have convinced me to trade it in for one that says WTF. In spite of all the strangeness, I realized what a great bunch of friends I have, and how many of the things I worried about worked out in the end, so maybe March turned out to be a pretty good month after all. Here's to April!

      Watching the  urlLink 400 Blows  and  urlLink La Strada  was a great change of pace from watching more mainstream films. Both defy an easy genre classification -- they were both funny and gut-wrenchingly tragic at the same time.  The films were small. I don’t write “small” meaning trivial or insignificant. I use the word to convey that the films were character driven rather than spectacles. They were intimate; I forgot that I was watching movies and felt like I was observing the occurrences, both big and small, of these people’s lives.   I liked the realism of the characters in the  urlLink 400 Blows . Take Antoine’s teacher, for instance. At the beginning of the film, he struggles to keep control of a classroom of rowdy boys. If that was his only scene in the film, he could be classified as “the mean teacher” because of the harsh way he deals with the students. But later on he shows genuine concern for Antoine over his mother’s death. The next day, he almost jokes to Antoine about his punishment. One temperament, but many different reactions -- just like people in real life.   urlLink La Strada  takes the idea one step further and taught me that it’s possible to create very unlikely characters but still make them behave in believable ways.   The films used so much more than words to create emotional depth of character. The way that the mother ( urlLink 400 Blows ) studies her face in the mirror conveys the regret that she feels about the direction her life has taken more effectively than words could have done. In  urlLink La Strada , Zampano’s rough handling of Gelsomina reveals what a cruel brute he is. Appropriately enough, they part ways  in winter, which is cold and is associated with things dying.  I think the theme of the  urlLink 400 Blows  is that a person decides his own identity. Getting caught in the classroom with a racy picture starts a chain of events that puts the boy on the road to ruin... Antoine begins to define himself by imagining, “I deface the classroom walls...” (I am a bad child.) He later tries to define himself as Balzac; however, this proves disastrous.   urlLink La Strada  wrestles with the universal question, “What am I here for?” The Fool suggests that everything has a purpose. Gelsomina decides that her purpose in life is to be with Zampano, even though I suspect that she would have rather gone on with the Fool.  If you're in the mood for a different sort of film, why not try out the foreign or subtitle section at your local library?

      Yesterday we took a group of friends up to visit  urlLink Freeway Church  in  urlLink Hamilton , Ontario. It's about a 3 hour drive from our home, which gave the seven of us plenty of time to enjoy each other's company. We took a different exit off the QEW this time which gave us a much different impression of the city. In January we came in through the "industrial sector." Picture factories straight out of a Tim Burton Batman film spewing black and grey smoke everywhere. But this time we drove in from a different direction and saw that Hamilton is actually quite a nice city -- nothing at all like the setting for a Mad Max movie that our previous trip had led us to believe. I think their whole economy is based on  urlLink Tim Horton's  and  urlLink Pizza Pizza  shops, as we seemed to pass them every block or two.  We made it to  urlLink Freeway  in plenty of time for its 6 pm meeting only to discover that the location had been moved that evening for a special art gallery/coffee house. Luckily for us, we ran into  urlLink Chris  from the church who gave us directions. Turns out it was only around the block, but when you don't know your way around the city...  As always it was a blast to hook up with  urlLink Pernell  & Company. They had set up an impromptu gallery showcasing artwork by members of the church and young people from the drop-in center next door. There were some poetry readings and some great music, too. It wasn't what we were expecting, but it turned out to be just what my leadership team needed -- just to relax and have some fun.  urlLink The Freeway  is a group that knows what church is all about. Check 'em out if you're ever up in the  urlLink Hamilton  area.

      I remember enough Dale Carnegie to avoid discussing politics or religion in polite company. After pursuing input for my latest blog post, I can add a third taboo to the list: warning labels on music. It seems that everyone has a passionate -- if not well-informed -- opinion on the topic.  The use of parental warning advisory labels is a particularly contentious issue as it touches on musicians’ freedom of expression, young people’s rights, and the rights of parents to be, well, parents. It my intention to examine the history and the implementation of the stickers. I also hope to clear up some misconceptions about the labels, and to offer some personal opinion on their effectiveness.  Parents teach their children to be safe. When a child is a toddler, a parent will tell them not to touch the stove because they will get burnt and to hold their hand when they walk down the stairs so they don’t fall.  As a child grows, the messages continue, but reflect their growing independence, examples such as don’t talk to strangers and look both ways when crossing come to mind. By the time the child reaches the teen years, the instruction is still there, but reflects an even greater freedom: don’t go on an unplanned date and obey the speed limit are just two examples.  Parents also enlist the help of other institutions that reflect their value system such as clubs, religious organizations, and educational institutions. The goal of this instruction is to foster a child over time into a fully functioning member of adult society. But what if someone who doesn’t share a parent’s values captures a child’s attention? Will a child internalize or emulate social ideas that could prove harmful to itself? The prevailing train of thought seems to be better safe than sorry based upon some of the restraints put in place on entertainment consumption for children and teens.  Popular culture that appeals to young people and adult restraints go hand in hand. In the early 1950s, anxiety over sex and violence in comics led to the creation of the Comics Code Authority, which held sway over what subject matter could and could not be portrayed in comics. In the late 1960s, the Motion Picture Association of America began its ratings system that assigns movies to different age categories based upon content. More recently, the National Association of Broadcasters has added a similar ratings system to television that allows a parent to block programs of a particular rating on newer televisions. Post–Columbine concerns over violence have seen a ratings system added to video game cartridges.  Rock n’ Roll was always cast a suspicious eye by authority figures even from its earliest days. It was an art form enjoyed by both blacks and whites in a time when segregation was the status quo. The “jungle beat” was accused of encouraging everything from juvenile delinquency to loose morals. (If you ever have an opportunity to look over an old tract or pamphlet denouncing rock ‘n roll notice how many thinly-veiled racist slurs are used.)  The sixties were the decade of discontent. Popular music was adopted as the soundtrack to the protest movement of the 1960s. Musicians became spokespeople on issues of civil rights, the Vietnam War, drug use, and religion.   The proliferation of FM outlets and the diversification of radio formats in the 1970s allowed many rock bands to push the limits of acceptable content far away from the more community-oriented airwaves of AM radio. It became possible to be a successful recording artist without benefit of a hit single. Punk rock demonstrated a fad that sold records despite receiving very little airplay on any format of radio station—the records spewed out a variety of antisocial anthems that wouldn’t have been tolerated by the FCC. (In Britain, where punk was more popular, the artists experienced a great deal of radio censorship.)  The advent of MTV in the eighties saw rock music enter a visual age that went far beyond the pelvis of Elvis and mop top haircuts. Radio became secondary to music videos in breaking hit singles, and the short clips had much to do with building a band or solo artist’s image. Some videos, like Dire Straits’ Money for Nothing or the Cars’ You Might Think used cutting-edge visual effects to get attention. Many others showed bands affecting a macho swagger against authority figures, such as Twisted Sister’s We’re Not Gonna Take It. Other music video directors gave heed to the low budget filmmaker’s muse: breasts are the most inexpensive special effect. Artists like Prince and Madonna got a lot of press out of sexually–charged images in songs and videos.  Although there were calls for regulating the music industry from groups as disparate as fundamentalist evangelists to the PTA, most historians regard the first shot of what would be dubbed the “porn wars” as the day that Tipper Gore, a senator’s wife from Tennessee, brought home the album Purple Rain and put it on the record player. She recounts the incident in her book, Raising PG Kids in an X–Rated Society:  "In December 1984, I purchased Prince’s best–selling album Purple Rain for my eleven–year–old daughter. I had seen Prince on the cover of magazines, and I knew that he was the biggest pop idol in years. My daughter wanted his album because she had heard the single “Let’s Go Crazy” on the radio. But when we brought the album home, put it on our stereo, and listened to it together, we heard the words to another song, “Darling Nikki”: “I knew a girl named Nikki/Guess [you] could say she was a sex fiend/I met her in a hotel lobby/Masturbating with a magazine.” The song went on in a similar manner. I couldn’t believe my ears! The vulgar lyrics embarrassed both of us. At first, I was stunned—then I got mad! Millions of Americans were buying Purple Rain with no idea what to expect."  This is the part of the story where the average parent would toss the LP in the trash or return it to the record store. But Tipper Gore wasn’t the average parent. She was the wife of a senator and had the connections and influence to do something about it. With a group of eight other wives of prominent Washingtonians, she formed the Parents Resource Music Center and held a meeting to raise public awareness about the issue in May of 1985. A letter presented to Stan Gortikov of the Recording Industry Association of America explained their ambitions:  "It is our concern that some of the music which the recording industry sells today increasingly portrays explicit sex and violence, and glorifies the use of drugs and alcohol. It is indiscriminately available to persons of any age through record stores and the media.  "These messages reach young children and early teenagers at a crucial age when they are developing lifelong value systems. Their minds are often not yet discerning enough to reject the destructive influences and anti-–social behavior engendered by what they hear and see in these products.  "Because of the excesses that exist in the music industry today, we petition the industry to exercise voluntary self–restraint perhaps by developing guidelines and/or a ratings system, such as that of the movie industry, for use by parents in order to protect our younger children from such mature themes.”   The conservative mood of the country was on their side and the PRMC capitalized on the exposure with editorials, magazine covers, and numerous television interviews about its proposals. But nothing could prepare have prepared it for the media frenzy surrounding the congressional hearing on record labeling in September 1985.  Who can forget the image of Frank Zappa and Dee Snider addressing members of congress? Or the rock–musician–turned–youth–minister reciting the lyrics about the guy pooping on a girl’s face? Although it made for some interesting television viewing, the hearing accomplished little, if anything, towards the implementation of labeling records. In fact, in doing research for this paper I couldn’t find a pressing explanation for the hearing. Congress didn’t intend to consider any legislation regarding record labeling  and the Recording Industry Association of America had already agreed to develop a system of warning stickers. So why were the hearings held? I can only suppose that it was a show of muscle to insure that the Recording Industry Association of America followed through on its promise. In any event, it still took another five years (!) to get the RIAA to make good on its promise for a universal warning label on music.  In March of 1990, black and white stickers bearing the words PARENTAL ADVISORY EXPLICIT CONTENT first appeared in record stores across America. Individual record companies choose to participate or not, and it is they, not an independent board (like the MPAA) that decides if an album warrants a warning label.   A warning label, in my opinion, was the best way to balance out parents’ concern with artists’ rights to free expression. In a perfect world, I could end the paper here. But as Tonio K. once sang, “This ain’t no perfect world.”  In an informal survey I sent around my company’s intranet, I asked 40 parents to describe what warning stickers were, who decided what CDs get labeled, and what the stickers mean. Only one answered correctly. The most common answer was the government decided which albums get labeled and the presence of a sticker makes it illegal for a minor to purchase the album. What I found most disturbing was the impression that most of the responders were happy with the system as they imagined it: to let an official body decide what their children could and couldn’t listen to.  I also spoke with a record store employee on condition of anonymity (Not because I was asking for a sizzling expose about the shady dealings of his employer, but rather because of the fear instilled in chain store employees). She couldn’t recall a single time in the last year when a parent was involved in a music purchase with their child, beyond handing a twenty over. If a minor wanted to purchase a stickered product they just brought along an older sibling or friend.  Which brings me to another result of the warning labels. Many stores restrict purchase on stickered product to people under the age of eighteen. Other retailers, like Wal-Mart, Sam’s Club and K-Mart won’t stock stickered product in the first place. It’s given rise to “clean” versions of an album (songs deleted or edited) being offered by record companies as an alternative.  The issue has come a long way since 1985. Who would have guessed that at a recent summit of hip hop industry leaders and artists that they would adopt a resolution to expand the warning labels to advertising and the internet? But no simple tool can take the place of parental awareness in raising a child.

      I layed in bed last night, restlessly tossing and turning. I couldn't will myself to sleep anymore than I could have willed myself to fly. My wife, T--, hadn't been feeling too well before bedtime, so she was downstairs sleeping on the futon. Otherwise, I would have probably just toughed it out in the dark, but instead found myself turning on the light.  Tuesday was a tough day. I spent it cleaning my office, and came across so many old files pertaining to the church. So many dreams, so many disappointments. Looking at those old bulletins and idea files, I couldn't help but get caught up in the hope and excitement of the early days of my work. But now the dreaming is over. My workplace is giving every indication that the outreach work we're involved in will be dead in the water by October.   One o' clock, Two o' clock. I stressed. I read. I stressed some more. I read 1 John. I read a chapter in Walter Wangerin's  urlLink Book of God . Great. It was the part where Jesus turns all dark before and during the Passover. I stressed some more. I leafed through the latest issue of  urlLink Macworld . Stressed. Tried to lift my mood with  urlLink The Tabloid Bible , but the laughs weren't forthcoming. More stress.  "I've been proactive. I've sent out some resumes, called my contacts. I even have some really good leads." But my lack of self-confidence betrayed me. The darkness seemed to press in on the one lonely lightbulb burning in the night. "What if I can't find a decent paying job? Where will I work? How will I take care of everyone?"  I should have been happy last night. I was happy last night. It was my daughter's 11th birthday. We went out to eat and had a great time. We were all silly and loud. I looked at my daughter across the table and noticed what an attractive young lady she has turned into, with friends, hobbies, and opinions. I couldn't have imagined any of this when we brought her home in 1993 -- a fragile little bundle. How things change.  How quickly, too. What's 11 years, anyhow? Just a few thousand ordinary days. When H-- came home from the hospital her mom and dad were just newlyweds, with little experience of the harsher realities of life. Today it seems like we've survived every trial imaginable -- a miscarriage, broken dreams, financial difficulties, even a brief separation. Conflicts within and without. But we survived.  Tonight we went to Applebees to celebrate. Okay, so it's not Planet Hollywood. But when H-- was born, eating out was out of the question. I worked three jobs but couldn't get ahead. T-- and I didn't always know how we were going to buy formula, diapers or even pay the rent. (I remember a few years into our marriage that going out to McDonald's every other week on payday was a big deal.) The south side of Jamestown isn't going to be mistaken for Beverly Hills anytime soon, but it is nice to be able to celebrate once in awhile, buy groceries, and not have to worry about taking the kids to the doctor!  In 1993, I had a certificate from a technical school. I never imagined that I would ever have a college degree. But now I have a few of 'em. In 1993, I had a job. But now I have a profession. In 1993, we rented a chilly apartment. But now we own our own home. Or at least the mortgage company lets us think we do! All those changes. All in just a few thousand ordinary days.  Life is funny like that. How did I go from being a DJ and video editor to pastoring a church and doing public relations? I've changed so much emotionally, spiritually, and socially. The little H-- laying in her crib would hardly recognize me. Heck, I wouldn't recognize me.  A few dozen people will gather for church next Sunday. They will come in bearing every kind of wound and burden imaginable. At about the midpoint in the meeting I will approach the pulpit dressed in my silly blue pilot's uniform, and give them something that can help them make it for another week. I can only do this because I have hope. I have been through dry spells so long that it seems like rain is nothing more than a cruel rumor. But the rain did come. I have been desperate beyond words and seen things work out. I have seen my marriage crumble away to dust, but somehow, get drawn back out of the tomb like Lazarus. I have drawn on reserves that I never knew I had. I have seen the providential hand of God at work.  All in just a few thousand ordinary days. I remember thinking, "Today's troubles will be tomorrow's victories." I was comforted by the thought. I read a chapter of Brennan Manning's  urlLink Abba Child , said a prayer, and slept at peace. (I also had dreams that comforted me, but for the life of me I can't remember what they were about. Just the warm feeling they left me with.) I woke up and the birds were singing.

      Christians get wood over the silliest things. The current one is over The Passion. People are talking about how this film is going to spark a religious revival in America. Now, I thought The Passion was a good film -- maybe even a great one. But to assume that one movie is going to make the U.S.A. into one big Bible belt just isn't going to happen.  Just like it didn't happen after 9-11.  Just like it didn't happen after the "seeker sensitive" movement.  Just like it didn't happen after the WWJD craze.  Just like it didn't happen after the Promise Keepers movement.  Just like it didn't after the Republican Revolution.  Why are Christians so eager to latch onto the Next Big Thing when the last dozen Big Things are lying discarded in a landfill somewhere? Why does the church get caught up in the frenzy of the latest fad like it's some teenybopper shopping for the latest trendy sneakers? Is it so desperate about its viability that it needs to continually clutch at straws?   Imagine a hospital that has turned into a health club. The patients aren't there for surgery -- they go go there to maintain their health. They ride exercise bikes, lift weights, and do Tae Kwon Do. But the problem is, they never got around to taking the hospital sign down. So once in awhile, someone comes to the emergency room because of a life threatening illness, or a gun shot wound. Nobody there knows how to do surgery or even diagnose anything anymore. One person tries to put a terminally ill patient on a treadmill, someone hands the man bleeding from a gunshot wound a band-aid. They leave with their pains intact. They were lucky -- they got more attention than most. More often, someone walks into the emergency room, takes one look at the exercise equipment and exits because they know they need a real hospital. One day, the hospital hears about a movie playing down the street about Dr. Lister. "Finally, a movie about surgery!" they say. "Now people will be lined up around the block to come to our hospital!"  This is the church today. It's a club for nice people who have it all together, but there's not much there for people who really have problems. People walk in all the time burdened and wounded, but get the message in a hundred different ways that they don't fit into the church's reality. It must be confusing as hell to the uninitiated, because the church should be all about finding compassion, forgiveness, healing, wholeness, and dare I say it, God?  Frankly, the church needs to get more interested in people and less interested in converts. After all, you don't need a motion picture, or a bracelet, or a stadium event to help people. Maybe if we stopped cheerleading a movie and actually paid attention to the words and deeds of the Person it was based on, both the church and the world would be a better place.

      I've been part of an ongoing discussion with a few friends about how many of our contemporaries from the 70s and 80s have walked away from the Christian faith. From my church youth group alone, I can only identify maybe 3 or 4 of us out of a group of about 20 people who "kept the faith." I started to reminisce about the good old days -- 1980 to 1986 -- at the Assembly of God in Warren, PA. I remember the cold, somewhat smelly room in the basement where we would have C.A. Group. (C.A. stood for Christ's Ambassadors.) At best, youth group was a blast; at worst it got you out of "big people church" on Sunday or Wednesday nights. We also had the coolest youth pastor by the name of Steve Scott. We put him through hell, because we were bratty little kids, but we loved him dearly. I wish I knew how to contact him now, just to say hi.  Remember all the rumors that you heard if you grew up an evangelical Christian during the Carter and Reagan years?  1. The Moonies owned Proctor & Gamble. If you bought P & G products, you were supporting a cult! 2. A computer in Belgium had the name of every person in the world on it, so the Anti-Christ could keep track of who had "the mark of the beast" and who didn't! 3. Rock groups hid backwards messages in records to corrupt youth! 4. Jesus was coming back soon! (As in no later than 1983 or 84!)  And how about our heroes? People like Jimmy Swaggart, Mike Warnke, Jim Bakker, and Pat Robertson... They all reassured us that we were we right and our culture was wrong. They all told inspiring stories that made living out our faith sound so easy. But we then we moved from youth group into adulthood and found out that life wasn't so easy after all. As our heroes one-by-one we're exposed as frauds, it hardly seemed a surprise at all.  Inside the church we tsk-tsk our friends who have drifted away from the faith. We surmise they weren't committed enough... the pull of sin was too strong... or that they were deceived by different philosophies. The truth is that they were deceived. They were deceived by all the B.S. that was spewed out of the Krazy Kristian Kulture for the first eighteen years of their life. They bought into the easy faith, where people always colored within the lines and a few Biblical principles could solve every problem.  It doesn't really amaze me anymore when I hear that an old acquaintance has walked away from the faith. I guess I'm more amazed that any of us are left.

      I sit here and type these words while my is foot propped up on a stack of pillows. I am suffering from an acute attack of gout. Yes, gout. I mean, seriously, have you ever heard of anyone other than a pirate suffering from gout? I feel like I should go to the dentist right now and be checked for scurvy! Luckily, gout can be treated with a minor change in my diet, increased water intake, and some medication. But until the condition is alleviated, I will have to make some lifestyle changes:  1. Incorporate eye patch, hook, and peg-leg into my business-casual attire. 2. Trade-in dog for a talking parrot. 3. Only refer to wife as "wench" and son as "cabin boy." 4. Withdraw money from bank and bury in treasure chest in back yard. 5. Fly the Jolly Roger from the radio antenna on my Dodge Neon. 6. Build gang-plank onto front porch. 7. Answer phone by saying, "Ahoy, Matey!" 8. Substitute traditional peanut butter sandwich with hard-tack at lunch time.

      Is there a connection between television viewing and senseless violence? Most everyone seems willing to muster an “armchair opinion” on the topic, but Ann Marie Seward Barry makes a learned and convincing case for an affirmative answer to that question in her book  urlLink Visual Intelligence .  Sometimes writers who tackle this subject appear too biased to state a convincing opinion. But Barry doesn’t appear to bring an agenda to her research. I don’t mean to imply that she’s detached from the subject. It’s just that she doesn’t let her passion about this serious issue bypass the considerable amount of information she collected. Instead of putting me on the defensive as many lesser writers could, her scholarly and methodic approach allowed me to convince myself.  Barry chose a good cross section of trustworthy sources, including the American Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, the Center for Media and Public Affairs, and the National Institute for Mental Health. She also utilized a variety of physicians, educators, and statisticians in her writing. Avoiding for the most part special interest groups lends credence to her conclusions. The only source I question her using was Ted Turner, because he has such a reputation for making inflammatory—and not always well thought out—comments. I understand why it’s tempting for a writer to make use of such colorful comments, but “you’re known by the company you keep…” A minor quibble.  Barry doesn’t write in generalities. She very carefully defines aggression and violence. She doesn’t make an ultimately futile case for a connection between a specific TV program and a direct violent action. Instead, she proposes that repeated viewing of violent media is a desensitizing influence to young children. Preadolescents build an “emotional memory” that connect violent images and pleasure—later senseless acts might just be a way for the subconscious to relive happy moments setting in front of the TV.  The effect of media violence is a complex issue—so complex that it’s hard not to spot a misassumption or a flaw in the communicator’s logic. But Barry logically builds her case and finds reliable statistics and sources to support her argument to its chilling conclusion. I suppose that the best analysis of her work is that it motivated me to pay closer attention to what my children are watching!

      I've been feeling so out of place lately. Circumstances are causing me to make some major life changes over the next few months. So many people I know are pushing for me to move in a particular direction, even though I don't believe that's my destiny. I try to articulate how I'm feeling and my thought processes, but they just give me back spiritual clichés and pat answers. I feel so alone. But I draw great strength from this prayer in  urlLink Celtic Daily Prayer: Prayers and Readings From the Northumbria Community :  Lord, help me now to unclutter my life, to organize myself in the direction of simplicity. Lord, teach me to listen to my heart; teach me to welcome change, instead of fearing it. Lord, I give You these stirrings inside me, I give You my discontent, I give You my restlessness, I give You my doubt, I give You my despair, I give You all the longings I hold inside. Help me to listen to these signs of change, of growth; to listen seriously and follow where they lead through the breathtaking empty space of an open door.

      “"Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.”" -- Matthew 5:13, The Bible (KJV)  I read this passage in my morning devotional reading. Although I realize that Jesus employed these words as a metaphor for Christian witness, I couldn'’t help but think about these verses in relation to my recent reading of Roger Streitmatter's excellent book,  urlLink Mightier Than the Sword .  Salt.  It’s a preservative. It’s a purifying element.  Salt is also painful. Who hasn’t heard the saying-–cum–-cliché “rubbing salt into a wound”?  At it’s best, the Fourth Estate offers more than just a simple recitation of the facts of an event. It digs deeper. It lets the public know the implications of the events. It interprets what the event means to the average person in the street. It doesn’t wait for the story to come to them, it goes off in search of the story.  Just like salt, at certain critical points in this nation’s history, the press has functioned as a preservative of the American ideals of freedom and justice. Just like salt, brave newspaper and magazine reporters have used the power of the press to purify bad elements out of society. Just like salt, the social upheavals caused by the media’s exposure of the injustices of big business hasn’t come without its share of pain.  Although this country has always had its share of crusading journalists, many people consider their golden age to be the first dozen years or so of the twentieth century. At the turn of the century, the American Dream seemed only to be benefiting the rich and big business interests always seemed to be holding all the cards.  Sound familiar?  Into this landscape of injustice and corruption stepped a group of brave men and women journalists that came to be known as the Muckrakers. The origin of the unique moniker is explained in Streitmatter’'s book:  "The term that ultimately came to define this journalistic phenomenon was coined by President Theodore Roosevelt, who led the larger reform movement that the journalists helped to spark. During the Progressive Era, government attempted to reassert its control of business through myriad new agencies and regulations. The youthful and buoyant Roosevelt supported journalistic reform, but in one of the volatile moments that defined his personality he lashed out at the crusaders for finding nothing good about society but looking constantly at the negative elements -- as if raking muck. The epithet took hold, and the golden age of reform journalism became known as muckraking."  Muckraking is sometimes confused with yellow journalism. This is incorrect, although there are some similarities. Both chose topics that appealed to common working people. Both employed an emotionally engaging style of writing. Both paid off big in the circulation wars between newspapers and magazines. But the muckrakers were accurate in their reporting, something to which the yellow journalists could never lay claim. Yellow journalism also tended to emphasize lurid stories as an end unto itself. Although sordid details were also a crucial element to the crusaders’ writing, muckraking appealed to something higher.  It demanded change and got it.  Lincoln Steffens investigated the runaway corruption in city and state governments and the adoption of the city–manager form of government is a lasting monument to his writing. Ida Tarbell acted out a contemporary David and Goliath story with the Standard Oil Company. The fruits of her labor are still felt today through the many public works of the Rockefeller Foundation, a charitable trust which was set up as nothing more than a savvy public relations move. Ray Stannard Baker chronicled the abuse of power through labor unions and ousted corrupt leaders in the process. Upton Sinclair’s novel  urlLink The Jungle  shocked the public with unsanitary conditions in food plants and poisonous ingredients in medicines. The nation’s outrage paved the way for the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906.  What would our lives be like today if the crusaders hadn’t shined a spotlight into the dark corners of America?  I sometimes wish they would return.  Think about it: We moan about our dependence on foreign oil when in reality most of what we use comes from our own soil. Elected officials consistently vote down school vouchers while sending their kids to private schools. The USA thinks its the policeman of the world. And since people don’t see any of this on the evening news, none of the situations exist.  Muckraking was a unique win-win situation for publishers where public service and earning a profit peacefully coexisted. There’s no doubt that the stories sold newspapers and magazines. But they also made America a better place.  I don’t think that balance could be maintained today as the media itself -- AOL/Time Warner, Disney/ABC/go.com, MS-NBC -- is the monopoly that needs reformed. And just try printing or airing anything controversial when everyone on the fringe left or the religious right is so willing to protest the advertisers who are footing the bill.  The Fourth Estate sells us all of us short when it’s satisfied with glossing over stories in a detached fashion.  Because there’s nothing worse than salt that’s lost it savour.

      I love  urlLink Citizen Kane . I have seen it dozens of time since college. It always bugs me that anytime I talk about the film someone has to gasp: "Rosebud..." It's not like it's the only line in the movie or anything. Here's my favorite quote, and it wasn't even delivered by  urlLink Orson Welles :  "A fellow will remember a lot of things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me. One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry, and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in, and on it there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on. She was carrying a white parasol. I only saw her for one second. She didn't see me at all, but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl." -- Mr. Bernstein, played by  urlLink Everett Sloane

      I saw  urlLink The Passion of the Christ  in Erie today with a group of friends from church. It doesn't quite sound right to say that I enjoyed the film -- quite the contrary, sometimes I had to avert my eyes from the onscreen action. So maybe it would be more accurate to say that I regard the film as an outstanding achievement. It's obvious from the first shot to the last that director  urlLink Mel Gibson  was captivated mind and soul by this outstanding story.  "It is as it was" is an oft-repeated quote attributed to the Pope regarding the film. I disagree with that statement -- while the film is reverent with its subject matter, it is still a dramatic reinterpretation of the events of the Gospels, with additional scenes written in to flesh out the narrative. I didn't pick up on anything anti-Semitic in the narrative; indeed, the Romans come off much more as the villains of the piece. I was a little surprised to see the character of Satan portrayed by a woman. Was Gibson trying to make a statement by that unique approach to casting? Nobody I've talked to about the film seemed to notice or care. I wonder if people's reactions would be different if the character of God would have appeared in the film played by a woman? Worth thinking about.  I first heard about this film last year on Harry Knowles' outstanding movie website,  urlLink Ain't it Cool News . I have to admit that when I first heard that there was this Jesus movie being shot in Aramaic, my first thought was "this movie is going to sink without a trace." Foreign language films do bad enough in the USA, but movies that utilize uncommon languages, like  urlLink Incubus  (Esperanto) and  urlLink Deafula  (sign language), end up gathering dust in a film vault somewhere. Boy, was I wrong. The Aramaic actually helped me suspend my disbelief in a way that a group of classically trained actors with British accents never could. (There are subtitles for key points of dialogue.)  A common mistake that many Biblical epics make is that they try to cover too much ground in one film. Remember  urlLink The Bible , which tried to condense most of the book of Genesis into one movie? Gibson shows a lot of wisdom in selecting a relatively short period of time for his narrative: the betrayal, trial, and crucifixion of the Christ. (Random flashbacks flesh out the characters, and the resurrection is briefly glimpsed at the end.) I grew up hearing this story all my life, so it was easy for me to put the story in its wider context; I wonder how much sense the film makes to people that haven't had as much exposure to the Bible?  I have read a few articles in which reviewers, obviously moved by the suffering, question who the characters are and what motivates them. A few suggest that perhaps the story should have included more of the events leading up to the events of Holy Week. But that wasn't the story that Gibson wanted to tell. Many of Jesus' teachings can be found in other religions and moral codes. Even the concept of blood sacrifice as a way to appease the gods goes back into prehistory and many varied cultures. But the important difference in the Gospel is its focus on Jesus as the perfect sacrifice for all time to an imperfect mankind. And that's a story worth telling.

      PEOPLE OF EARTH, MY NAME IS JOEL. I’M MAROONED IN SPACE. I’M THE SUBJECT OF A BIZARRE MOVIE-WATCHING EXPERIMENT, AND NOW I GUESS, SO ARE YOU.  That’s how comedian Joel Hodgson once summarized the premise of his television program,  urlLink Mystery Science Theater 3000 . One of the few television programs not produced in New York or Hollywood, MST3K (as it is known by its fans) began in 1988 on a small UHF station and quickly moved to the national spotlight on cable television every week through 1999, all the while never leaving its home base of Minnesota.  Since the television production capabilities of the North Star State were somewhat lacking in comparison to its counterparts on the east and west coasts, the creators wisely stuck to a simple visual style that could have just as easily been shot in the 1950s as the 1990s. That’s not intended as a criticism. Quite the contrary, its chintzy visual charm would allow the program’s best asset—it’s humor—to take center stage.  For the bulk of its run, the show featured only two real sets: the control room of the Satellite of Love, where a human guinea pig and his robot (puppet) friends are held captive, and Deep 13 (later Castle Forrester), where the evil mad scientists plan their latest schemes. Each set is only ever shot with one camera—there are no reaction shots or cutaways. If the director of the episode wishes to draw our attention to a particular object on screen, the camera operator just zooms in over the course of the segment. The actors play more to the camera than to each other, which is very appropriate, because we aren’t watching characters on a television show, we’re watching an experiment in progress shot by a never seen robot named Cambot.  But the program is more than just a demented puppet show. At the end of one of their rants on pop culture or a song parody, the mad scientists activate the movie sign. The wall in the back of the set opens up and the camera (actually, we, the viewers) travels down an odd looking tunnel that finally ends up in the theater.  The theater segments, accomplished by a relatively simple special effect, is the main visual element that is identified with the program. Even channel surfers who stare blankly when confronted by the show’s title will immediately recall the image of an old movie playing with the silhouettes of our heroes sitting in movie theater seats at the bottom of a screen. That’s the bulk of the program: the crew of the S.O.L. making wisecracks during an entire feature-length movie.  The simple format works surprising well, probably because the writing is so strong and varied. A bit of witticism that hinges on an obscure reference to a Greek play might be followed immediately by a fart joke. The surrealistic host segments allow the performers the flexibility to stage both Green Acres and Ingmar Bergman parodies. (One area of humor that the stable of writers tends to shy away from is overtly sexual jokes; a bonus that makes it one of the more family-friendly shows on TV.) The concept and the humor are so distinctive that it allowed the show to get away with numerous cast changes over its ten-year run without missing a beat. The concept even translated without a hitch to the big screen for the S.O.L.'s one and only motion picture venture in 1996.  With the  urlLink Sci-Fi Channel  canceling the program last January, the only place to observe the Dr. F's diabolical experiments now is on DVD.  urlLink Rhino Home Video  has released numerous single episodes and boxed sets. They're definitely worth a look for bad film fanatics, horror/sci-fi buffs, and comedy lovers.  Puppets, stage-bound skits, and overdubbed movies. King Solomon was right: there is nothing new under the sun. But even if MST3K wasn’t the first program to use these ideas, it did combine them in a most original way. And isn’t that what a successful experiment is all about?

      I just finished  urlLink Lion Country , the first of  urlLink Frederick Buechner's  quartet of books about the not-so-right Reverend Leo Bebb. The first thing I have to say is that this is a funny, funny book that I could not put down. The book is written from the perspective of Antonio Parr, a sometime writer from New York City, who buys a mail order ordination from Bebb's diploma mill in Florida. Antonio infiltrates the seedy operation to gather information for a juicy expose to bring down Bebb and jump-start his writing career.  That goal isn't quite as easy for Antonio to achieve once he reaches the Sunshine State, as he finds himself sucked into world of the Church of Holy Love, Inc. and gets entangled with its inhabitants:  Lucille Bebb: The reverend's scary wife, who numbs herself with special "Tropicanas" to forget the wounds of the past.  Sharon: Lucille and Leo's promiscuous adopted daughter.  Brownie: The forever put-upon and theologically unsound chancellor of Bebb's "Bible College," who was raised from the dead by Bebb under dubious circumstances.  And finally --   The Reverend Leo Bebb: The ringleader of the whole circus. Is he a snake living off "the Lord's payroll" or a dangerous crank? Or is he being used of God to accomplish some strange work?   urlLink Buechner , a Presbyterian minister, is a master of language who makes each paragraph a joy to read. In lesser hands, this setup could be  urlLink one more example of religious fiction populated by cardboard characters , but Buechner accomplishes the impossible: Antonio—and the reader—begin to actually care about this cast of misfits.  Authenticity in the church means a lot to me, and I got some big laughs out of Bebb, who is the epitome of every pastor who's message only makes sense on Sunday mornings. I've worked in a few religious organizations—which can be great, but also has exposed me to the seedy underside of things and the questionable crap those goes on behind the scenes. Too often authenticity is punished while "playin' church" is celebrated. I'll be honest—there are times when I want to leave this whole church thing behind. But it's just as true in my situation as in Lion Country: the church may drive you nuts and be guilty of a hundred other sins and dysfunctions, but it's still God's method for conveying his message to the world. And somewhere in the midst of all that dirt and muck, some diamonds can be found.

      Apple’s advertising campaign,  urlLink Switch , is a big step in the right direction for the computer giant. Previous campaigns, such as Think Different, which exclusively focused on artistic-types who already form the company’s core market could be criticized as “preaching to the choir.” But this new campaign does a wonderful job of sharing Apple’s gospel with the unwashed PC-using masses.   The TV campaign avoids the glitz and pizzazz usually associated with computer commercials. In fact, the ads are about as low-tech as they come: just people standing against an opaque background. Only two of the nineteen ads feature b-roll. The music, with the exception of the ad featuring rappers De La Soul, eschews pulsating synthesizers in favor of piano and banjo in a soundtrack that can only be described as a “shuffle.” Instead of polished actors, the ads feature real people—real looking and real sounding people—from a variety of walks of life (business owners, students, parents, musicians, etc.) describing the virtues of Macintosh computers. The whole package is a folksy approach that sends a message to viewers that what they’re seeing is genuine. Each ad would have been just as effective if filmed in the person’s home or work environment, but the white background unifies the whole series and allows the viewer to quickly connect each successive ad together. (White also symbolizes purity.)  The greatest objection that Apple has to overcome in selling its computers is that it’s impossible to function with a different operating system in a Microsoft Windows world. It’s a myth based largely on misconception, and the Switch campaign does a magnificent job at educating the public.  The first message I noticed in the commercials was what’s so great about Windows anyhow? Anyone who’s ever used a computer can identify with the problems identified in the spots, such as: system crashes, lost files, and missing cables. High school student Alex Schocknecht sums it up when he simply states, “It [his PC] couldn’t work for three days without something going wrong.”  Although the testimonies are frequently punctuated by humor (Ellen Feiss’ ad is drop-dead hilarious), it becomes apparent that a computer problem leaves the user absolutely powerless. Father Bill Swan missed much-needed sleep when his PC would not print his daughter’s homework. Feiss’ computer “ate her homework” and she had to hand in a hastily composed substitute to her teacher. Lawyer Theresa McPherson would waste precious time troubleshooting her computer after it froze up at a critical moment.  Previous Apple campaigns highlighted its computers’ technical superiority or aesthetic beauty. The Switch campaign simply describes how a Macintosh solves problems. Janie Porsche and Gentry Poss explain how the Mac’s plug-n-play features save them time and frustration when hooking up peripheral gadgets. College professor Fabiola Torres describes how Apple’s simple software allows her to improve the learning experience with multimedia. Just to make sure that viewers understand that Macs are compatible with the wider computer world, two of the ads feature computer technology professionals who have to interface with Windows systems everyday.  The ads do a good job of creating a desire to switch from Windows to Macintosh. Since you have to use a computer everyday, why not use the brand that will do what you want it to do? As Scatch DJ Qbert puts it, “You have a dream of it, throw it on my Mac, and boom, it’s reality.”  “It makes me feel powerful.” Student Hamilton Morris

      (WARNING:  The following article is not intended for - nor recommended for - those who are easily offended by things of a 'geeky' nature.)  I'd like to make the case for the idea that maybe a musical artist is NOT the best person to write his or her own liner notes for an album reissue.  Case in point...one of my all-time favorite albums:  Electric Light Orchestra's 1981 album, "Time".  Now bear in mind that I have loved this album since its original release some twenty-odd years ago.  Beyond the obvious science-fiction angle, I love the various themes this 'concept album' explores.  Ostensibly the tale of a man mystically transported through time into a future world some 1000 years from now, the lyrics and music - in my humble opinion - transport the listener into a whole other 'reality'.  The album explores such themes as the protagonist's fear of this 'Brave New World' he finds himself in (in the song "Twilight"); his discovery of the emptiness of a relationship with a beautiful 'replicant' woman ("Yours Truly, 2095"); his desperate longing for his lost love ("Ticket to the Moon"); his aversion to the changes he sees in the futuristic landscape ("The Way Life's Meant To Be"); and - despite his feeling of not 'fitting in' ("21st Century Man") - his eventual acceptance of the time period he finds himself stranded in ("Hold On Tight").  So given that lofty concept and the truly fantastic music that accompanies it, you can imagine my delight when I discovered that there was a newly-released 're-do' of the original "Time" available - this one featuring three rare 'B-sides', complete digital re-mastering, AND liner notes from bandleader Jeff Lynne himself!  ...FINALLY...an insight into what inspired this masterful tale of a man trapped in a destiny he did not make!!!  SURELY, thought I,  the master himself - Jeff Lynne - will enlighten this eager acolyte with tales of the origins of - and deeper meaning of - this pop-rock masterpiece!  ....Well........  Here is a sampling of some of Jeff's wisdom - on a song-by-song basis....  ************************************************************************************* "Yours Truly, 2095":  ...Typical, it's about a bloke who falls for a robot.  Say no more.  "Ticket to the Moon": ....Drama in space.  "Rain Is Falling": ...I think it's about some scientists trying to mess about with time.  But it's quite a nice tune.  "21st Century Man": ...About someone who is lost.   AND FINALLY...his overview of the whole "Time" project in toto: ...This was one of them concept ideas.  It was about time travel, so it's supposed to be all futuristic and daft.  None of these ideas have been disproved yet, and only another ninety-odd years to go to see if I was right!  *************************************************************************************  Yeah....bit of a letdown, wouldn't you say?  (And please don't call me Shirley!)

      I am the swarthy captain of a merchant marine vessel, transporting Tic Tacs across the South Seas. My ship is run aground on a small island during a typhoon. I am the only survivor. The radio is broken and I have no means of calling for help. Hunger gnaws at me day and night, until a pallet of Tic Tacs washes up on shore. I do a quick calculation in the sand: Since each Tic Tac has a nutritional value of 1 1/2 calories, all I have to do is eat 1334 a day to give myself the daily 2000 calories I need to survive. I crack open the pallet and am delighted by the bright colors and sweet rattle. I slowly and methodically consume 1334 Tic Tacs that day -- first a fresh mint, then a wintergreen, followed by a spearmint, then a cinnamon and back again to the fresh mint to restart the cycle. I repeat this for a number of months, watching my supply continually dwindle, until I finally consume the last Tic Tac. It has a pleasant taste followed by the perfect hit of mint. I am sad that I will die alone on this uncharted island, but am thankful for the Tic Tacs and how they helped me get a bang out of life while they lasted. I die peacefully in my sleep.  Years later, a group of sailors arrive on the island and discover my skeleton. They are amazed at my minty fresh odor.

      I said a prayer for Dick before I ever met him. This was about five years ago. Dick was going through his heart problems and the Pattersons added him to the prayer list at church. But he didn’t remain an anonymous name on the bulletin for long. It wasn’t but a few Sundays after that that I got to meet Dick in person, with his brother Jimmy in tow.  Dick was one of the funniest people I ever met. He was pretty fast on his feet when it came to one-liners, and could give the impression to the unacquainted that he was a real curmudgeon. But it became apparent that he wasn’t that way at all when I took the time to get to know him. Dick had a real passion for the human services field and loved to talk about the people (he didn’t use the word “clients”) that he had the privilege of helping. And certainly his relationship with his brother is one of the greatest pictures of love between two people that I’ve ever seen. Wouldn’t the world be a lot better place if we all treated each other with such compassion?  Read the newspaper. Turn on MSNBC. It doesn’t take too long to figure out that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong with people. The Apostle Paul wrote about the condition of mankind in his letter to the church at Rome: “They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, slanderers, God–haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.” (Romans 1: 29–32) Would we deny that our condition has improved over the last nineteen-hundred-and-some years since Paul penned those words?  A terminal illness makes a guy think. And Dick had two or three of ‘em. He didn’t just see that things had gone terribly wrong in the world—he recognized that things had gone terribly wrong in himself. And Dick came to the conclusion that Jesus Christ could help. In Saint John’s biography of Jesus he states: “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.” (John 3: 16—17)  One of the things I liked best about Dick was that he didn’t put on airs. Dick was the real deal. His newfound Christian faith was authentic. His beliefs didn’t cause him to ignore the realities of life—these last few years of his life were hard—but he did experience a new kind of hope in the midst of his daily pain, and was comforted by the promise of a new life to come. He neither excused his past nor glorified in his previous indiscretions. He had this almost childlike sense of wonder about the love he found in the person of Jesus Christ. Dick would shake his head in amazement and say, “You can’t comprehend what a vile, wicked person I’ve been.” Dick experienced what the Psalmist wrote when he said that the Lord is “a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness.” (Psalm 86:15)  Everyone always says that they want to go in their sleep. I can’t say that I disagree with them. But Dick knew that the end was coming. He kept saying that he was going to fool everybody and walk right out of that hospital, but that was born out of desire to comfort his family and friends rather than out of any conviction that it was actually going to happen. We’ll never know what Dick went through in those last couple days. I bet he felt the full range of emotions. In the midst of this crisis, he began to doubt if Christ had really forgiven him.   People have a hard time putting their trust in other people—that’s why we have laws, contracts, lawyers, and lie detectors. And for a few days Dick questioned if he could entrust his soul to Christ or if he was sins were so bad that they disqualified him from his offer of eternal life. Remember that old TV show, Fight Back? David Horowitz would say, “If it sounds to good to be true, it probably is!” And forgiveness of sins sounds pretty good.  I ate lunch the other day in the hospital cafeteria. When I got to the checkout, I realized that I had left my money lying on my desk at work. But then a nice lady offered to buy my lunch for me. It only cost two bucks, but I still offered to pay her back. I hate the idea of someone having to bail me out. I’d much rather find a way to take care of everything myself.  But some things are beyond our ability to take care of. It was true for my lunch that afternoon. It’s also just as true about the sin in our lives. We may try to tow the line or keep the rules, but at some point or another we bungle it up. There’s no amount of restitution that we can perform to undo the damage that we’ve caused to the people around us or even ourselves. In other words, we need bailed out. Hear these words of Saint Paul: “For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering.” (Romans 8:3)  We try being religious. We try being a good person. We try to excuse our own bad behavior. But deep down we know that it’s not enough—our own consciences accuse us. There’s only one bridge between a screwed-up mankind and God. That bridge is Christ. If He can’t take on your whole burden, he can’t take any of it. Dick, his fiancée Eileen, and I had a chance to talk about these things a few hours before he moved on. Then I said a short prayer and headed home for some shut-eye. (I just noticed that the first and last thing I ever did for Dick was pray for him.)  When Dick moved on, he was most definitely at peace with His God.  I’d like to finish with a few words from the book of First Timothy in the Bible. This was Saint Paul’s testimony, but somehow I can hear Dick saying this: “The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst. But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life.” (1 Timothy 1: 15—16)

      No matter how blended, unique or challenged our family life may be, I don't think too many of us can stand on the same ground as Hamlet. Sure, not many of us have royal blood coursing through our veins; but after reading one of Shakespeare's most widely performed tragediesmaybe that's a really good thing.   Hamlet, away at school, returns home to find his father dead and his mother remarried to his uncle. Only two months has passed since his father's untimely death and Hamlet is besought with grief and horror at his mother's impulsiveness. This is the typical, "I can't believe you could every love anyone but Dad! reaction when a widow remarries. But Hamlet goes beyond the typical reaction by calling his mother's remarriage an "incestuous relationship." Take a disgruntled, spoiled son, a duped but truly happily remarried mom, plotting politicians and the revengeful ghost of a murdered father; and you have a perfect panel of guests to appear on the Springer showno questions asked.  Everywhere the reader looks in this play they find tragedy, death and dishonesty; but the one thing everyone seems to be looking for is truth, beauty and love. Unspoiled and sincere love is what is sadly missing in each of the character's lives. Hamlet loves Ophelia, but denies her his attentions after the ghost of his father incites him to murder. The ghost incites Hamlet to revenge his death because "his wife" is now married to his murdering brother. Claudius murdered his brother not only to gain his crown, but the affection of Gertrude. Gertrude, lost in the loss of her first husband and attracted to married life unwittingly marries Claudius.   The lives and characters in Hamlet are unique and unpredictable. Just when you think Hamlet is going to tell the ghost of his father to shove off, he agrees to a life of revenge and an eternity of damnation. Even when there is opportunity to escape the revenge of his father, Hamlet is consumed by guilt and madness to destroy Claudius' happiness.   Hamlet sacrifices his and Ophelia's own happiness to his obsession with revenge. Hamlet privately refuses Ophelias love, but confuses her by showing her physical affection in public. Ophelia, caught between the wishes of her family and her own desire for Hamlet does nothing and becomes consumed with grief and loss. She allows herself to remain frozen between the hope of actualization and the tragic denial of her diminished dreams. Her loss of Hamlet and her Father's death leave her to madness and eventually death.   Claudius, demonized by Hamlet's rants, prays to God for forgiveness for his desire for power and the murder of his brother. However sincere his prayer of forgiveness is, he is unable to recognize that the continued brutality and plotting against Hamlet is wrong.   Gertrude seems to be the only character through the play that love's her life, or at least tries to make the best of it. She loved her first husband dearly but instead of resigning herself to widower, she remarries and loves her second husband passionately.   Shakespeare's characters are human beings.   The characters in this play are not flat cookie-cutter produced roles. Human beings are unpredictable, they lie, they tell the truth, they sin, they repent, they live and they die.   The occurrence of madness in this play is more than a facade' put on by Hamlet or the venue of expression for a woman with dashed dreams. The madness of Hamlet is that the love each character so desperately desires is well within their reach. Yes there is murder and wrong doing, but if Hamlet's father would have truly loved his son - would he have asked him to kill for him? If Ophelia was lost without Hamlet, she could have learned from the Queen that love can be found again. Hamlet needed to see that his father's revenge really didn't belong to him. Hamlet could have been a creative, intelligent leader, but his life that brimmed with potential was wasted in the pursuit of revenge. Sadly, Hamlet didn't see his misguided focus until death had consumed his entire family and eventually himself.   Hindsight is said to be 20/20. Revenge is death. Children pay for the sins of their fathers. The themes that encompass Hamlet are as many as the sayings from it that are still popular today. Thematically speaking, the need for love in this tragedy speaks to my heart.  So many times, I know what is right and good and lovingand I don't go after it hard or long enough. I allow love to slip though my hands too easily. I resign myself to revenge, bitterness or despair all because I think that the real deal is beyond my reach.   If I really want to build that sandcastle, I need a shovel, a pail, and maybe even a John Deere backhoe to do things right. The tide of life pulls hard to pull away our hopes and dreams, but love is the glue that can hold things together. A castle made of sand is vulnerable to the elements that wear at its foundation and surface. Sometimes we have to move our castle to a safer location or sometimes we have to stand guard to make sure no one tramples it, but we have some say in how things in life ends up. We cant stop trying. Madness occurs when love, unselfish love is abandoned like a sandcastle built too close to the shore. Even if all we can do is stand guard, at least well gain a great story and a little wisdom from a life well lived and loved. Maybe I protest too much, but if I don't protest for love who will?

      April 2004 was a month that promised spring, but never really got around to delivering in a big way. The season actually seemed to be going backwards, quite often feeling more like February than April!  The Passover musical on the radio didn't seem to fit with the wintry weather I was driving through on the way to my friend J--'s birthday party. The backwoods in northwestern Pennsylvania have their own "terrible beauty" especially on a grey, cold day. It was quite a contrast to step into a warm, inviting home to spend the afternoon with friends. J-- turned 40, but you wouldn't have guessed from the decorations -- all superhero stuff. I could have never imagined any of our parents having Hulk decorations back in the day. Maybe my generation is just living out a lengthy childhood -- I celebrated my birthday (36) watching monster movies!  I took a much-needed vacation after the busyness of Holy Week. I ended up in Kentucky, where there was evidence of spring! T-- and I reflected that we must be crazy to live up here in New York aka the North Pole.   Last Sunday I went to a  urlLink Youth Specialties  event in Buffalo. The "training" wasn't so much about techniques as it was about discovery. The facilitator led us through some exercises to help us discover our own unique personalities and gifts. It was some much-needed affirmation. The intensive kind of people-work the church requires can leave me worn out, and it's a big temptation sometimes to wish I had the gifts and abilities of more successful ministers. But it's much more important to be myself. I may not be the best, but I am genuine, and that seems to be a rare quality these days!  I spent a lovely evening at the  urlLink Mount Saint Benedict Monastery  on Wednesday. Being a rather shy type, I almost cancelled my reservation when I found out T-- had to work. But I'm glad I participated. Sister Carolyn and everyone was so friendly to the "new guy." We shared a dinner and then spent the evening talking about creation spirituality. The one thing I took back from the program was the Benedictine idea of living in the present. I spend so much time regretting the past or worrying about the future, so it was a message I really needed to hear. In an age of multitasking, it's a message we all probably need to hear. It fed my soul, and I will be back for other events.  If there's one word I would have to describe April 2004 with it would be encouragement. I'm really blessed with a group of friends near and far. A few days didn't go by in April that someone stopped by the office or called me on the phone and encouraged me. I even received a few letters and had some iChats from friends far away. Believe me -- it more than made up for the weather!  That was the month that was - April 2004...

      The girls at church today were talking about a feature they saw on TV about people who get paid to be "bathroom assistants" to musicians and actors. The gist of the job is that they proceed into the bathroom ahead of the star to scope out the room and empty it of people, if necessary. Then they guard the room while the entertainer, well, you-know, goes poop 'n' stuff. No word yet on if wiping is part of the job description...  And you thought your job was crappy!

      After wandering around wondering where I fit in most recently, I, B, H and myself had an opportunity to fit perfectly somewhere. We attended a Youth ministry training in Buffalo, NY and were in the company of a hundred or so youthworkers from our region. Some of the folks were total strangers, some peers  and previous youth members now in ministry jobs from our home town, and some from our various trips with The Sally Army. There was a closeness there today that you only usually feel on day three of a three day retreat - but this was only hours long. Maybe it was the "sameness" of our jobs, the overindulgence in junk food or the crazy act like a fool games. I frankly don't care what the formula was -- it was exactly what my overly busy, emotionally drained person needed.   There has been so much talk about "calling" lately -- mine, yours or otherwise -- that I was happy to be accepted for who I am and where I am being ok. How refreshing! It's like someone packaged this short seminar in a peppermint patty wrapper and I unpeeled it to experience something totally unexpected and new. I felt supported, accepted and loved. Experiences like this show me all the more, that "church" or even better "God" isn't limited to my small perspectives and limited vision. Jesus can break through the tough exterior I put up to protect myself.   A good friend of mine spoke about how Jesus pursues us passionately. Like a group of kids that throw a snowball at your car. Do I stop and get out of the car to see what they want or do I just keep on driving while grumbling about my car's possible injury?   The pain that we feel can be the snowball Jesus uses to get our attention. The side-splitting laughter of watching middle-aged youthworkers play outrageous mixer games can be the snowball that Jesus uses to wake us up. Even while feeling insecure about the "calling" of God on my life, I was hit with a snowball today.   We broke into small groups and we were asked to write on a note card: a burden, struggle or habitual sin that has been dogging us. The group was to elect and "pastor" to gather the burdens and exchange them for a small container of anointing oil from the platform. After the exchange, the "pastor" was to return to the small group and anoint the person to the left of them with oil while reciting "My the light of Christ renew your spirit." After a moment of polite banter, the group elected me to be the "pastor". That moment I felt like I had been hit by a snowball. But this one wasn't made out of snow. It was made of God's light. Tears were flowing as I walked up to the platform to release not only my burden, but the burdens of all my small group family. I laid the burdens down and collected the bottle of oil. The oil was light, hope and purpose all held in a small plastic travel shampoo container. Returning to the group I wondered If I would be able to speak for the emotion pouring from my eyes and voice, but as I turned, I knew I wanted with all my heart for Jesus to flood my neighbor's heart with renewing light. So I threw the snowball.  They passed the blessing to the next person, and so it continued until it was B's to anoint me with oil. Pastoring is caring for and lifting each other up. I started the chain, but each person in that room was a "pastor" to their neighbor. I offered a prayer of thanksgiving to God for this expression of grace and forgiveness and asked if others wanted to pray. Some did, some didn't but the wonderful thing was that each person was hit by a snowball. Fear, doubt, discouragement and despair melted away like remainders of ice from Niagara Falls in April. Some were big and some were small, but the thaw that starts today will continue to melt the burdens of my heart.  The core of my burden comes from the fear of not having a place with Jesus. I know that is impossible. Jesus accepts me, love's me and has a place for me...no matter where I am. My core isn't in what I don't have, but in what I do have. Jesus is the one that can get to the core of things and help me to exchange my burden for his light.   No matter where I am: Jesus is my core. No matter what work I do: Jesus is my core. No matter what the future holds: Jesus is my core.

      Walter Wangerin's  urlLink Book of God  is a true oddity in the world of publishing: a book based on another book. And not just any book -- The Bible, in fact. When I came across this book at  urlLink Borders  in Erie PA, I wondered what the purpose could be of adding yet another version of the scriptures to the dozens of translations and paraphrases already lining the shelves. I'm sure I wouldn't have given it more than a passing glace but for Wangerin's reputation as a master storyteller. After leafing through the book, I was intrigued enough to pick up a copy.   urlLink The Book of God  doesn't really claim to be a Bible. It's more a chronological retelling of the Bible. It begins with Abram and ends with the birth of the church. Even though I've grown up hearing about these events all my life, the book finally helped me tie it all together as one story. Wangerin breathes life and personality into the characters who are usually only remembered by one significant event in their lives. Sometimes I found myself thinking, "that part couldn't be in the Bible," only to look it up to find that it was really there.  So often Christians have reduced the Bible to a book of mere rules and propositions.  urlLink The Book of God  is different in that it causes one to look at the totality of a character's life, and not just at the couple of verses we memorized in Sunday School. I found myself regularly reflecting on the people and events in a way that I seldom have before. What a discovery process. My only criticism of the book is the last few pages. Wangerin seems like he is rushing to a conclusion and trying to hit every "theological biggie" by the end. I missed the leisurely pace of the rest of the book.  I would recommend  urlLink The Book of God  to anyone who wants to get a good overview of the story of the Bible. I would also suggest that pastoral staff consider incorporating its reading into the confirmation or discipleship process of the church.

      One of the cool things about traveling around the country is sampling the local cuisine.  In Columbus, Ohio we stopped at an Italian restaurant. I can't recall the name, just that it was a chain somehow connected to TGI Fridays. It looked pretty classy inside, not at all decorated in the "let's nail a bunch of crazy old crap to the wall" motif that seems to be in vogue at every other sit-down restaurant these days. I had the strangest exchange with the waitress. When I ordered spaghetti and meatballs, she looked me in the eyes and said flatly, "I'm disappointed in you." I'm still pondering what she meant by that. After all, spaghetti and meatballs would seem to be a fairly common order in an Italian restaurant. Does she say the same thing to every customer that orders it? Maybe her disappointment in me sprang from something else: Did she know me from school or something and was lamenting the fact that I grew up to be a big fat oaf? Or was she a gifted psychic who predicted the crappy tip I was going to leave her? I guess I'll never know. Anyway, it was a good plate of spaghetti and meatballs, but not worth the $11.95 plus tip plus low self-esteem that it cost me.  People always say that Wisconsin is the cheese capital of the United States, but I discovered that people in Southern Ohio/Indiana/Kentucky could give the badger state a run for its money. These people just L-O-V-E cheese on their foods. Lots of it. If you order a food item, it will be roughly composed of a 50-50 mixture between the food and cheese. I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak at Thunder Over Louisville that was so covered in cheese that it actually destroyed the structural integrity of the sandwich, causing an avalanche of steak, onions, peppers and cheese on my t-shirt.  I saved the best for last. I finally got to eat at a White Castle! I've been salivating over their commercials for years, but lived in a part of the country without any franchises. But they're all over that region! So I convinced my traveling companions to let me complete my life's ambition on Sunday afternoon: Eat a White Castle hamburger! A mere description of this momentous occasion simply will not do it justice. So I composed a Japanese haiku instead:  white castle smells good greasy paper thin meat slab special is square bun  I'm starting to tear up, so I need to sign off for now. Spaghetti and meatballs, Philly Cheese Steak, and White Castle. Do I know how to dine out or what?

      I got to do something on my vacation that I rarely get to do otherwise: sleep in! T-- and I woke up to discover that it was 10:45 in the morning, which is pretty late for us, even on a Saturday. Thinking that we were holding up the rest of our friends, we got quick showers and headed downstairs to find out that only two other people were up and about. I guess ten-hour car rides will do that to you.  We made it downtown by 3 pm for Thunder over Louisville, the kickoff event for the Kentucky Derby. It's a six-hour airshow that features everything from biplanes to jet fighters. It was a pretty relaxing day all-in-all, lounging around the riverfront with 750,000 other people. After dark, the fireworks show to end all fireworks shows began. The regular part of the fireworks is better than any finale I've ever seen; the finale looks like the whole world is ending. I wonder what they do on the 4th of July?

      We crossed the Ohio border into Indiana around 8 pm last Friday evening. We were driving now on a state route road, which made for a pleasant change from the highway congestion of the previous ten hours. Instead of billboards and shopping plazas, I was looking at railroad tracks. I was looking at utility poles that we so old they still used ceramic conductors, wires droopy, and the poles themselves pockmarked and leaning too far left or right under all the years. At home, it had snowed just two days previous, but Indiana was far enough south that flowers had already blossomed. And then it hit me all at once -- the most wonderful scent. I was breathing in spring. As the van came around a curve, I became aware of the sunset -- brilliant pink being absorbed into dark blue at the horizon. I had the desire to ask J-- to pull the van over so I could just lay down in the grass. I spend too much time dwelling on mistakes of the past and worrying about the future. So I consider it a gift when nature bursts in like this and causes me to live wholly in the moment. Sometimes it's wonderful to be alive.

      “They couldn't print it if it weren't true.”  Have you ever heard that statement in regards to the veracity of a newspaper or magazine article? Maybe you've heard someone use a variation of the saying in regards to a radio or television broadcast, or a news story from the world wide web.  I've always preferred musician Lou Reed's maxim on the news, “Don’t believe half of what you read and three-quarters of what people say to your face.”  That may sound a little cynical -- okay, a lot cynical. But then again, Lou Reed ain't exactly Edna St. Vincent Milay. But I've always interpreted the statement to mean that information received from even the most respected source still needs to be critically analyzed.  I spent my formative years in the 1970s and 80s in an environment that would best be described as Evangelical Christian. If you've ever talked to people who was brought up in that subculture, I’m sure they've clued you in to the -- uh, unique worldview that’s fostered in those surroundings.  I remember reading "news" articles that ranged from just plain goofy (Can a Christian be a Mason?) to some dangerous seeds that could be planted in unbalanced individuals (None Dare Call It Conspiracy, a book-length expose of social movements, business and government that implicated everyone from the Rockefellers to the Beatles in a global domination scheme that makes The X-Files look positively reasonable by comparison.)  Police cover-ups of satanic ritual child abuse? AIDS, the product of a military research and development lab? A hoax called the Holocaust? Hey, they couldn't print it if it weren't true! Well, yes they can… and frequently do.  As I became lot older and a little wiser, I began to question more of what I read in newspapers and magazines, heard on the radio, and saw on television. In fact, I can vividly recall the first instance I recognized bias in the right-wing press.  I was 19 or 20 and worked for a small religious radio station in the northwestern hills of Pennsylvania. In between our mostly sad attempts at culturally relevant music, we would play short daily commentaries from various churches and parachurch icons like Tim and Bev LaHaye, James Dobson, Marlin Maddox, and Phyllis Schafly.  The particular commentary I recall was from conservative pundit Charles Colson. He was arguing against public schools adopting safe-sex curriculums. He mentioned that it wasn't just a conservative issue, but that the actual tide of public opinion had turned to abstinence and that liberal school board members had better wise up to their constituency.  As an example of "the tide of public opinion," he referenced an article that had recently appeared in a fashion magazine. I can't recall for the life of me which fashion magazine it was… Cosmo, Elle, Glamour, they all look alike to me. But what I will always remember is the name of the article: 2000 Virgins. I remember chuckling and thought it would make a great name for either a band or John Waters movie (I still do).  A few weeks later I was waiting to get a haircut. (Actually, I was getting my hair styled… This after all, was the 1980s.) I was at one of those salons where it never occurs to the stylists to get a Popular Mechanics or Consumer Reports in the waiting room in case a man wanders in. So out of sheer boredom I dug through a pile of heavily perfumed fashion magazines. And there it was, tucked between magazines offering to teach me how to undress for my man and lose the fat on my thighs: The cover story 2000 Virgins.  I decided to read this story of people choosing abstinence. However, I was rather taken aback when I discovered that the article turned out to be about "technical virgins." A few thousand words were devoted to interviews with women about the enjoyment of petting, oral, backdoor, etc.  I remember being very disillusioned with Chuck Colson. He took the tiny part of the article that agreed with his conservative agenda (abstinence) and omitted any mention of the actual details of the article, which was a far cry from the Christian ideal of "purity of heart."  In the weeks that followed, I began to question more of what I heard on my radio station: America is a "Christian" nation. Says who? People on welfare are capable of work and just playing the system. What case studies have you done? Glasnost is a Soviet trick. Really? Did Gorbachev whisper it to you over vodkas? I guess owe my membership in the Democratic Party to Chuck Colson!   Nowadays I wince when I recall a lot of my youthful news sources. I recognize that a lot of it qualifies less as “news” than straight-up urban legend.  I’m sure that a lot of religious magazine or book editors (and their readers) would be horrified that I consider a lot of their stuff biased. After all, they are just telling the truth that the other media ignores! But whose truth? From what sources?  I’m sure that in many cases their religious beliefs muddle up their critical faculties: "If the right reverend doctor says that this new bill in congress is an attack on the church -- and I already feel marginalized by society -- I'll take it as the Gospel Truth."  But by what right does the reverend speak as a political commentator? Will any members of congress be interviewed for an opposing viewpoint? What is the actual wording of the bill? A passionate editor can too easily allow his worldview (persecution of Christians) to short–circuit a more balanced handling of the story.  Bias isn't just a problem with the media of the religious right. It's always existed in various news organizations and probably always will. Bias isn't just a problem of the conservative right. Heck, I know each issue of the ultra-liberal Sojourners will have at least one article so out of reality that it’s good for nothing but a big belly laugh!   Rodger Streitmatter, in his book  urlLink Mightier than the Sword: How the News Media Have Shaped American History  describes how an anti-British bias was utilized by the press to help sow the seeds of discontent that came to a head in the American Revolution. Many papers relied more on editorial techniques that created emotional reactions in readers rather than constructing logical arguments for colonial self-rule that could be intellectually examined. In fact, many news journals of the day are known to contain highly exaggerated versions of real events, many more have been discovered to contain outright fabrications and lies.  This information was something that had been passed over in my public school education (or maybe I was just absent that day due to being ill) and I have to admit that this section of the book left me somewhat disturbed. It’s not like I walk around with rose-colored glasses or anything, but I became aware of America in the era of the Bicentennial: school assemblies watching Johnny Tremain, church and community picnics dressed in 1776 fashions, and the cartoon and comic book The U.S. of Archie (don’t ask). Discovering that the press chose to use made-up stories to create a suitable atmosphere for rebellion is somewhat akin to finding out that Batman receives payoffs from the mob, Mister Rogers donates his salary to the Man-Boy Love Association, or that America’s girl next door, Britney Spears, had breast implants. (Wait a second, the last one really happened. But you get the gist.)  It always hurts to find out that a hero has feet of clay. But it will make me question a little more of what I see on television. How do I really know what social and political life in "Country X" is like? Especially when the images I’m fed -- say, an orphan refugee child -- is certain to prey on my sympathies. I’m being asked to choose sides in a complex political/social/economic action by looking at one single image in the newspaper or on the television. Is that enough information to decide if I should support U.S. military strikes against "Country X"? I don’t think so.  Maybe I can make that argument clearer if I reverse it. What if "Country X" sent a news crew to document the human rights abuses in America? Night after night of prime time television, its citizens would be treated to images of urban slums and homeless people, news reports of the differences between rich and poor and racial profiling. Would the television viewers of "Country X" support military action against the oppressive regime of the United States of America? Darn right they would!  Remember the news footage of Islamic Fundamentalists celebrating after the collapse of the World Trade Center? It made my blood boil, but even then I realized that my image of America and their image of America are two different things, just as my image of the Islamic world is alien to their experience. The maxim of propagandist Samuel Adams is just as true today as it was in the 1700s: "Arouse the masses -- the real shock troops -- by instilling hatred of enemies."  Sometimes biased stories can backfire and bring harm upon the very cause an editor is trying to promote. Abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison spent forty–nine days in jail after losing a libel suit against a slave trader. Although it's highly unlikely that he could of corroborated his story by interviewing the trader, the libel suit and jail time couldn’t have helped advance his abolitionist stance among people who's opinions were yet undecided.  Citizen Kane himself, William Randolph Hearst, and Joseph Pulitzer raised news bias to an art form in the latter part of the nineteenth century, resulting in the Spanish-American War. In an effort to boost circulation, newspapers daily pushed the cause of Cuban rebels against Spain, even if that meant exaggerating their suffering and manufacturing untrue news items. America actually developed what was known as a "war psychosis" that involved the country in a conflict that could have easily been avoided.  The Spanish-American War is probably the most extreme example of the damage that can be inflicted by a biased press. But another, maybe even more insidious form of damage can occur in the attitudes (and later, actions) of readers who they just unquestionably accept whatever information is handed to them.  News bias will exist as long as certain passionate members of the press let their ideology overwhelm their critical thinking skills and their integrity. Believe me -- I couldn't print that if it weren't true!

      I never used to be good at taking vacation. In previous years, I have actually passed on vacation time and spent it at work. But now I like to pretend the universe can get along without me, at least for a few days at a time. When I did manage to get away from work, I used to fill my hours by catching up with school work or doing things around the house. But this vacation is different -- I've graduated from college, and the weather has been too cold and snowy for yardwork. So I've kept busy doing nothing.  I drove the family to Dunkirk today. We walked the whole way out onto the pier and could see across to Canada. It was the nicest day that we've seen all spring, but Lake Erie was still covered with a lot of ice. We were reminded of it everytime the chilly wind blew. Then we took in a late lunch at a little Italian restaurant in Fredonia. I came back home and read a book and watched some TV.  No watch, no Palm Pilot, no cell phone. I could get used to this vacation-thing, being busy doing nothing.

      WEDNESDAY:  Back in 2002 I was asked to plan a Wednesday church meeting during Holy Week. I asked my boss just what was the significance of that particular day in the church calendar. He replied that it was called -- ahem -- "The Day of Silence." It sounded like it had some potential, at the very least it sounded way cooler than "Maundy Thursday." Heck, it sounded like a movie title. Try it!  STAR TREK 11: THE DAY OF SILENCE HARRY POTTER AND THE DAY OF SILENCE THE DAY OF SILENCE -- THE RETURN OF HANNIBAL & THE LAMBS  When I finally got around to planning the meeting, I discovered the horrible truth: The hump day of Lent is called The Day of Silence because nothing is recorded about the day in the Bible. So I got stuck with planning a church service about nothing, and Jerry Seinfeld was nowhere in sight. (It all turned out OK. I actually made it a quiet meeting with plenty of time for meditation and reflection.)  This year's Wednesday was anything but silent, and my wife and I are all the poorer for it. The church my wife and I pastor shares the same building space with two other churches. On big holidays (such as Easter), we "unite" for a big service, which usually means an uber-traditional hymnfest with 2/3 of the congregation wondering what they're doing there in the first place. I try to have a good attitude about the united events, but I always seem to approach them out of a sense of obligation rather than anticipation. Also, a week's vacation would begin Easter Sunday after church, which meant that I had a lot of work to do before then. And then a few coworkers got under my skin.. and finally... I BLEW UP. Yep, yelled and pouted and acted like a complete ass in front of my wife. I took home the gold in the Olympic Jerk competition.   The worst part was that it didn't even occur to me until after the fact that my wife, who did nothing to provoke my tantrum, got the brunt of my outburst while the objects of my anger didn't even get a disgruntled growl. I wondered how many times I've played that scenario out? I can act professional under any circumstances between 8 to 5, but feel perfectly justified to act like a grump the second I get home. Or I give 110% on the job, but feel too worn out to play with the kids when I'm at home. Where do I get off giving my family the scraps? Something has to change... I have to change...  I make a mental note to find a way to do something nice for T-- that can cancel out the way I acted. Grant her a divorce, perhaps?  THURSDAY:  Dreams are cool, because you'll say and do things that you never would in real life. That's also why dreams are scary.  I had a dream in the wee hours of Maundy Thursday. It was about an individual that I care very much about, with whom I've tried -- in my own clumsy way -- to share the goodness of life in Christ. In my dream this person decided to pursue their spiritual quest at one of the other churches in the building. I ranted and raved about how pissed I was because, after all, that person "belonged in my church."  I woke up and reflected that I really didn't like the person that I had become.  Now, I realize that dreams aren't real life. Maybe Freud was right and they're our subconscious speaking, but then again maybe they're just random electrical impulses that happen during REM sleep. In fact, the evening before I had actually encouraged a person to attend a different church because they already knew people there. But sitting there in bed with the light on, the jealousy and feelings of betrayal still felt so real. Sometimes I hate being part of the church.  And sometimes I love being part of the church. That evening we had a "united" meeting for Maundy Thursday. It was a Love Feast, which sounds like an orgy or something, but is actually a communion service with an emphasis upon reconciliation. We were instructed to take the bread and grape juice and serve it to someone else in the congregation. It was a beautiful experience with smiles, hugs, and even a few tears. It was one of those magical times when I really felt a sense of joy and wonder about being part of God's people. And I think everybody else did, too.  FRIDAY:   This was the meeting that I organized. I had been thinking a lot about what it means to be a peacemaker. I thought that one of the ways I could "make peace" in our churches regarding the combined meetings would be to make sure that everyone was represented at the service. The pastor from the Hispanic church sat in with our church's band and played some hymns and modern worship tunes. Some kids from the Hispanic church did a dance to a Spanish tune. The pastor from the traditional church sang a hymn to piano accompaniment. I did a multimedia presentation showcasing artwork of Christ's passion. So many tensions arise out of three churches being on top of one another, but at least for one night we were just one big church.  SUNDAY:  Sunday saw our family try something new that I hope becomes a tradition: we spent Easter in a bar. My cousin owns a moderately successful tavern and invited us all over for dinner. It was a relaxed way to spend the holiday, with plenty of conversation and laughter. Bars have a good way of loosening people up, and I wonder if the Women's Christian Temperance Union gave all of us Protestants a raw deal when they got us to give up drinking for the good of society.  In the Christian tradition, Holy Week is all about death and resurrection. I got to experience a little of both.

      I had a really relaxing weekend. Went to the movies with N--, spent a leisurely afternoon at the library, and celebrated my friend J--'s 40 birthday. Even a drastically low church attendance due to the shift to daylight savings time, a snow storm, and sickness couldn't get me down.  The best part of the weekend came when I picked up some Texas Hots at Johnny's Lunch, sat on my couch in my undershorts and watched  urlLink The Three Stooges  on TV. The thought crossed my mind that this is probably what my guidance counselor thought I would turn out like.

      Snow in April isn't the most surprising occurrence in the world. Unusual, but not impossible as a look outside the window and this week's forecast has to prove. After dealing with a household fighting step throat, sinus infections and ear infections for the last month - I'm really ready for some sun and warmth.   All I want is to pull out my spring clothes, hang up the thick tights and feel the beaconing sunshine warming my arm through the car window. I'd roll down the window if we got temperature's warmer than 50 degrees - sun or not!  Not that I want to complain, but the forecast says it's going to snow on  Easter. In the words of Charlie Brown,"AAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!" and "Oh, brother!'. Easter eggs don't go with snow ploughs, no matter which way you look at it.  So in hopes of warmer weather: I took some old clothes to the thrift store, bought my daughter sandals and as sun-dress, found my son a bright tropical shirt to wear Easter morning, recycled a winters' worth of soda bottles and cans and purchased a new pair of lightweight summer jeans. So far it's still snowing.  Snow or not, I will color Easter eggs. Snow or not I will celebrate Good Friday. Snow or not, I will participate in an Easter egg hunt- even if I have to wear snow-pants and boots.   Snow on Easter. Maybe they should make a Frosty the Snowman and Easter Bunny buddy movie for all of us that live in the snow-belt. I imagine claymation characters singing a  catchy song like " I deliver your basket faster in the snow", would make this a little easier. Maybe then snow in April wouldn't seem so weird.   Here's to frozen peeps candy and Easter baskets hidden in snow banks - Cheers.

      I fessed up in my previous post to the sad fact that I enjoyed  urlLink Scooby Doo 2  and hated  urlLink The Ladykillers . I decided to try a few more films to see if this was a one-time phenomenon or not. So I watched  urlLink The Return of Count Yorga , a badly acted, written, shot, and directed vampire movie from the drive-in's best friend, American International Pictures. Yep, I still enjoyed it more than  urlLink The Ladykillers . (I'm kind of ashamed to admit that I actually rewound the Robert Quarry fangfest and watched it again.) Then I moved on to a few  urlLink Three Stooges  shorts. Yes even Larry, Curly and Moe brought forth more yuks than  urlLink The Ladykillers . With empirical evidence to back me up, I can conclusively state that I hate, hate, hate the movie  urlLink The Ladykillers  and it was 97 minutes of my life wasted. Aren't you glad I got that off my chest?

      With half of the family sick -- again -- I've been catching up on my movie watching. In anticipation of seeing the new  urlLink Tom Hanks comedy , I decided to go to my local library and borrow the original  urlLink Ladykillers .  urlLink The Ladykillers  is a classic of British film. I have honestly never read a word about this film to indicate that it anything less than a comedic masterpiece. It has  urlLink Alec Guinness . It has  urlLink Peter Sellers . It was made by  urlLink Ealing Studios , associated with comedy in the same way that  urlLink Hammer  is with horror. So with the giddy anticipation of a schoolgirl, I gathered the family around our entertainment center and popped in the cassette for 97 minutes of fun, fun, fun!  I hated it.  Comic genius? I wouldn't even classify it as mildly amusing. It was like a funny movie with all the funny bits left out. It's an amusing premise -- a group of crooks being outwitted by a little old lady -- and I kept waiting for it to catch fire. But it just kind of stood there and fizzled.  With the girls sick with the disease of the week, my son, N--, and I decided to get out of the house for awhile to give them a little peace and quiet. I took him to the movie theatre hoping to see  urlLink Hellboy , but N-- talked/begged/pleaded with me to let him see  urlLink Scooby Doo 2 . How do you say no to a cute 7 year old? Even if you're going to waste the next 90 minutes of your life watching the latest turd from the Hollywood crap machine?  I loved it.  Yes, I loved it. Even with the gratuitous farting jokes, a "barricading the door" bit stolen from  urlLink Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein , and the sadness of seeing  urlLink Alicia Silverstone  demoted to costarring in a cartoon movie now that  urlLink Reese Witherspoon  gets all her movie parts. It made me remember why I actually liked this cartoon when I was seven. And the monsters, all from the cartoon and made up with today's special effects technology, just rocked. It wasn't a great movie, but it was a fun way to spend a lazy afternoon with my son.  Who'd 'eve thunk it? I hated the  urlLink Ladykillers , but loved  urlLink Scooby . It does have me speculating where it will all end though... Will I stop listening to  urlLink NPR  and pop in a  urlLink Clay Aiken  CD? Will I drop  urlLink Frederick Buechner  and start reading  urlLink Left Behind ? Will I -- gasp --  urlLink vote Republican ?

      A good novel leaves you wanting more. This was true of  urlLink Frederick Buechner's  magnificent novel  urlLink Lion Country . Characters like the slippery evangelist Leo Bebb, his milquetoast assistant Brownie, and his sexy stepdaughter Sharon were just too interesting to leave alone. I couldn't wait to dig into  urlLink Open Heart , the second of four books about the evangelist.  The book picks up a few years after the events of the previous book. Bebb has been riding the gravy train as the pastor of Redpath Ranch.  Antonio and Sharon haven't so much settled down as just plain settled for married life in Connecticut. Brownie is, uh, still Brownie. The death of millionaire Herman Redpath leaves Bebb more or less independent financially, and so he decides to try out his fortunes up north. Bebb, a good old southern boy at heart, makes the most out of the move, but why is his wife Lucille wasting away so? Sometimes a person's past has more of a hold on a person than their present, and even a change of scenery can't compete with unresolved issues.   urlLink Frederick Buechner  is a genius. He has the incredible ability to dream up these dislikeable characters and somehow, someway make you care for them. He can write a sad book that is somehow funny at the same time. Read  urlLink Open Heart . You will weep for Lucille.

      Today is Memorial Day. I'm typing away at my mom's iMac, not quite believing that June begins tomorrow. Where did the month go?  May was the month when I finally shook the depression and anxiety about the future that had been dogging me about the future. I guess I've developed a que sera sera attitude about my career, and am beginning to dream about what my future could look like if the rumored-changes at work occur. It also helped that I did something for myself -- I began a diet and have lost 20 lbs this month. My exercise program was a little less successful though, and I found myself laid up for a week with a bruised ligament which came from exercising on inadequate footwear and continuing to push on with daily walks and bikeriding when I was in pain. (A classic newbie injury.)  I spent an evening with J--, an old friend from my radio days, and his pastor. I shared my knowledge about website building and they returned the favor by talking to me about  urlLink the house church movement , something I'm very keen on learning more about.   We did our first annual community meeting at work. I was really satisfied with an annual report I put together which ran in our local paper. I have to admit that it was nice to get a lot of positive feedback from my coworkers and people in the community. I was also assigned a PowerPoint presentation for the meeting itself. I pushed the envelope quite a bit on this and turned it into a music video with moody black and white photography that demonstrated our  organization's work in the county. Both projects took a lot more time than I anticipated, but I ended up with two media pieces with which I'm really quite proud. I forgot how much I enjoyed hands-on media work!  Everything at church is going really well, with the exception of our finances! T-- and I introduced a some new small groups that really seemed to flourish this month. We also began a low-key meditative prayer meeting on Sunday evenings. We've had really small crowds, but the people that have participated have been really touched through the leisurely, intimate time spent in the presence of God. I hope to see this work grow in the coming months.  I've also begun to look out more diligently for my own intimacy with God. I continue to observe  urlLink The Daily Office , which has been a means of grace in my life since February. I began participating at a local pastor's prayer meeting. I also participated in a Labyrinth experience at  urlLink Mount Saint Benedict Monastery  which quite moved me. I've been reading the book  urlLink Soul Shaper  and trying out different spiritual practices from church history.  Last evening I had a blast with the family and a friend of ours at the  urlLink Park 60 Drive-In  in Jamestown, New York. We watched  urlLink Shrek 2  and  urlLink Envy . Yes, it's almost impossible for five people to remain comfortable in a small car, and the drive-in's FM system and screen is crap, and it's way too expensive -- but c'mon it's a drive-in! It transcends it's shortcomings and becomes a fun experience of Americana!   This morning I participated in the Memorial Day parade and ceremonies in Jamestown, NY. I got to ride in H--'s 56' Dodge and did the benediction at the memorial service in Lakeview Cemetery. It was the most official and public religious duty that I've performed since beginning this work two years ago, and I couldn't help but notice the irony: just when I finally feel comfortable in the role of a pastor I may be losing the job at the end of this summer! (But I didn't feel bad about the realization.) The family and I then went to my mom's house in Warren, PA . I spent the rest of the day -- well, resting! I fell asleep around 2 pm and just woke up at 7 pm! Must have been my late night at the drive-in!  May was a month where I tried a lot of new things, met a lot of new people, and saw that the future -- whatever that may be -- is something good to be embraced.

      Since I spent a good part of the last two weeks laid up because of a bruised tendon in my foot, I missed out on a high school play that M-- and H--, some girls from youth group had worked on. My wife and I decided to make it up to them by having them over for dinner and a movie. The movie thing can sometimes be more trouble than it's worth, because quite often the youth group will want to watch something that we wouldn't screen for teenagers, let alone watch ourselves (think  urlLink American Pie ); other times my wife and I will err on the side of discretion and pick a movie more appropriate to their brothers and sisters in elementary school (think  urlLink Jonah -- a VeggieTales Movie ). But I knew that wasn't going to be a problem this time as M-- is a horror fanatic rivaling even myself.  We ended up watching  urlLink Dracula -- Prince of Darkness  and  urlLink The Masque of the Red Death .  urlLink Dracula  was a no-brainer because the girls knew  urlLink Christopher Lee  from  urlLink LOTR  and they love vampires, I have to say that although I normally would rate this film as one of my favorite  urlLink Hammer Films , I found it to be a little slow-paced when viewed with a group. At least it picked up the pace a bit after the young couple escapes to the monastery and the ending on the cracking ice is one of the best conclusions in the whole  urlLink Dracula  series. I chose  urlLink Masque of the Red Death  because M-- had never seen any of the  urlLink Corman/Poe  pictures. I think that  urlLink Masque  is the best picture in the whole cycle. It took the girls a bit to work out that "the monster" they were looking for was the very human  urlLink Vincent Price . (We also scared the heck out of M--'s grandmother who had driven them to town and stayed for dinner. The directors of the films would be proud -- she gasped or jumped at every single shock.)  The verdict? For teens that most likely think of a horror film as something featuring Jason, Michael or Freddy, they were suitably impressed with these movies made almost twenty-five years before they were born. We're planning another double feature soon when I hope to spring some  urlLink Amicus  or  urlLink William Castle  on them...  Young people enjoying  urlLink Christopher Lee  and  urlLink Vincent Price  movies!   In these uncertain times, it kind of makes a guy have hope for the future...

      Aren't ants supposed to work together as a team? That's what I always thought. But I just saw something which is making me question that assumption: I noticed two ants scurrying around on my dining room table. Before I could sweep them away, one of the ants picked up the other one, walked over to the edge of the table and tossed his struggling victim over the edge. Now I can truly say that I've seen everything as I've witnessed an ant homicide. All was put right on the dining room table as justice was swiftly meted out to the murderer. I remain I.F. -- judge, jury and executioner.

       urlLink THE OOZE  is a website created and maintained by Spencer Burke, one of the emerging church's most important voices. Every aspect of the site is designed to facillitate relationship-building and idea sharing between people seeking to understand what "being church" means in the 21st century. It's an interesting stew of user-submitted articles, blogs, websites, and resources. It's the type of site that I'll intend to take a quick peek at but invariably end up spending two hours on. They've also added this very blog to its ever-growing directory, so you know it's a website of great taste and discretion!  urlLink Go get yourself stuck in THE OOZE today!

      Mothers and their children have connections that can inspire them to greatness or can hold them captive to expectation and the fear of being left alone. Learning when to break the apron strings is an important lesson Jill Conway learns in the  urlLink film  based on her book,  urlLink The Road to Corrain .   Jill and her family are strong independent people that desire to succeed in life. Jill is born and raised on acres of wild Australian rangeland on the edge of the desert. Her father raises sheep for a living, and her brothers help him in the work. Jill’s mom has the spirit of a pioneer woman and has worked very hard to build a dignified and proper home for her family.   Early in Jill’s family relationships, the viewer can see the great amount of expectation and promise that is associated with her abilities to learn, read and eventually become the matron of her family. Jill proves her academic abilities to her mother as she is home–schooled and in return aids her father with the herds of sheep after her brothers have been sent off to boarding school.  It is her passion for helping her father that comforts him during a drought that kills off much of his stock.   Tragedy is a catalyst for Jill’s development as a mature individual. Just as she learned to read while her mother lanced a boil on her leg, Jill learns to care for her father’s business during the drought. This knowledge proves to be invaluable after the sudden death of her father, as she emotionally supports her mother through economic trials.   Undoubtedly, Eve takes situations into her own hands by selling of some of her furniture and moving the city to find work after her husband’s death, but Jill takes on what seems to be a role of friend, peer and equal—more than a traditional mother and daughter relationship. Jill also begins to attend formal schooling when the family moves into the city. Jill thrives in school and earns many awards for her abilities, but instead of her mother’s support and approval, Jill begins to receive sarcasm and criticism from her mother. In some ways, her mother is responsible for emphasizing the importance of education, but perhaps her extreme working strains caused her to resent her daughter’s opportunity for successes.   The family succeeds in turning the family business into a profitable one, so education and privilege are given to all the children and her Mother. All three children struggle with pressure to satisfy and impress their mother. The oldest brother, even after given a car for his birthday, feels unacceptable in his mother’s eyes. After the sudden death of her eldest brother, Jill again takes on the role of matron, as her mother regresses into the shell of grief and despair she had visited after the death of her husband. Jill’s next oldest brother escapes from his mother’s emotional extremes by returning to Coorain to run the family business. Jill continues her education, but dutifully cares for her grief-stricken mother on a daily basis.   As Jill nears graduation, her mother seems to improve as she hopes for Jill to pursue becoming a doctor. But Jill’s denial of her mother’s wishes causes her mother to become more erratic in her effort to hold onto her.   Over time, Jill becomes aware that if she is ever going to be happy she needs to follow after her heart. She does so and ends up involved with a married American businessman. This relationship helps Jill to realize a great deal about love, choice and how unselfish decisions made in love usually have the greatest results.  Jill wants to be with this man, but decides to send him home to be with his family as she understands how terrible it is to lose a father. Jill becomes more aware through her interactions with this man that children need to move away from their parents at some point. Jill knows that she must pursue her dreams of becoming a history professor or be content with the choices in her life.   Eve was an amazing woman who had great abilities and a potential, but she allowed loss and bitterness to poison her love for others by pushing it into efforts to contain and control them. Jill respected the beginning that Eve gave her in life, but she understood that it was her life—not her mother’s.  Jill could have tried to control every relationship around her, but power wasn’t her desire. Love was her desire all along.   Love taught her to read. Love taught her to care for the sheep. Love taught her to support and care for those people who were hurting around her. Love taught her to be unselfish and give back what wasn’t hers in the first place; and to chase after what was.    urlLink The Road from Coorain  teaches families that tragedy and loss can be overcome, but the biggest tragedy occurs when controlling others becomes more important than loving them.

      I love this. It's called  urlLink Sacred Space . It's a website run by the Irish Jesuits. It guides you through the Ignatian Exercises with an elegant interface. I guess this is the kind of idea that Leonard Sweet considers "ancient future." The idea of praying at a computer seemed really odd to me at first, but I grew used to it quickly. In fact, I visit it enough to consider it a part of my regular spiritual disciplines.  urlLink Give it a try!

      I visited the  urlLink Mount Saint Benedict Monastery  this evening. The guest speaker was  urlLink Carol Posch Comstock , the founding member of  urlLink The Labyrinth Society . I had read a lot about labyrinths on  urlLink  Jonny Baker's website  and in the book  urlLink Soul Shaper , but I still wasn't sure what the fuss was all about. But in the words of Carol, "The best way to learn about labyrinths is to walk one."  After a time of prayerful preparation, I stepped into the labyrinth and started to slowly follow the long circuitous route to its center. Because I've been acutely aware lately of a need to be more conformed to the image of Christ, I silently repeated the prayer, "More of Jesus, less of me." When I got to the core of the labyrinth I just paused for awhile in the presence of God. Then I traced the route back to the outside thanking God for all the ways he is transforming me into his image. (I also tried a smaller labyrinth and even some small hand labyrinths that were on display.)  It was a beneficial experience that I would like to incorporate into my regular spiritual disciplines. I'm accustomed to sitting or laying down while I'm at prayer, but the act of using my whole body added an interesting depth to the experience. I also found it helpful that the labyrinth imposed a rhythm to my prayer: walking in I could express my lacking to God, wait on him in the center, and express my gratitude on the way out.  Thank God for the spiritual connections series at  urlLink Mount Saint Benedict ! In the midst of all the uncertainty at work these days, it makes for a nice personal time of refreshment and reflection each month.

      I need to preface this piece by stating that I'm not a car-obsessed individual. I don't buy specialized mud-flaps, design overly elaborate flame airbrushing techniques or get my car pimped-out with neon tubing. Normally, I’m perfectly happy putting around in my little Dodge Neon. But something strange is happening to me.  I think I'm going a little crazy—car crazy.  Remember when you were a month of two away from graduating from high school? All you could think about was:  “What will I do after I graduate?” ‘Who will be my friends after I graduate?” “After I graduate I will...”  I think you get my point—your present was overcome by a preoccupation with the future. Slowly but surely obsession over a car has taken up residence in the little space that was left in my conscious mind and I fear the lease was written for a long time. I currently have a 1996 Neon Expresso, and though it’s still running and doesn’t look too bad, it's beginning to show signs of eight years of family wear. I have replaced the brakes (several times), rotors (twice) and plugged several oil leaks that show no sign of stopping over the past few months. So last week after the starter in my car burnt out, I started to consider my options.   While the starter was being repaired a leak was found in the air conditioning unit. This repair and part would cost more than the starter did, so I opted to hold-off for awhile. So to be honest, the images of “shiny new cars with air conditioning, built in cd/stereo units and glossy new paint jobs dancing in my sweaty head” isn’t all that strange.  After a little discussion, my spouse and I decided to start “looking” for a new car. Now the only thing a person would really need to look is an eye. But this is where I think the new car virus really started to grow. It was such an innocent gesture—surfing the Internet for car information. I began reading and comparing the major car companies websites. I read reviews and compared similar vehicles I thought would serve my purposes of looking sporty, getting great gas mileage and lasting forever. Oh, and don’t forget the most important feature—the payments can’t be more than my “I-work-for-a-non-profit-agency” budget can afford. After gathering enough information to write a car reviews for Popular Mechanics, I continued to “look” by driving up and down the major auto sales street in my town (even when it really wasn't convenient). As my obsession grew I found myself surfing the net by day and visiting car dealers in the evening, but even that wasn’t satisfying my appetite for a new car. I finally spoke to a car–dealer friend of mine and it just happens that he sells the new cars I like the best. But speaking wasn't enough—I took one of the prettiest red sport wagons you've ever seen for a test drive. I let myself go in the fun of the moment. I cranked the stereo, rolled down the windows, drove it around town and zoomed on the highway a little. It was a zippy little thing. When I returned to the lot, my friend suggested I take it home to my husband and kids and have them test it out as well. I took him up on the offer. This is when new car obsession crossed into the realm of reality and it was beginning to get serious.  My kids loved the car, my spouse didn't seem to want to stop driving it, and being a passenger wasn't a boring experience either. I have to tell you, either the dealer had actors planted by the side of the road or people liked the look of the vehicle (or us in it—maybe both). There were people smiling at us and the car. This new car-itis is crazy stuff. My entire psyche was being fed all things that fuel the already car-obsessed mind. We returned the car after about a half hour of testing and everyone in my family was giddy and smiling. I remember saying to everyone, "Don't get too excited. This is only a test drive," but I think I was really speaking to myself more than anyone else. After a rather long conversation with the salesman and our friend, we said our good-byes and promised to return with our Neon to consider a trade-in. As I watched my family linger around the potential family fun car, I got a little nervous.   Fantasy and play are fun things, but now I’m going to have to do some number crunching. Ugh. I have to take some time to figure out the trade-in, down payment, and monthly payment for this pretty little number. Then there's a loan application process. Double Ugh!   I know that I'm really getting ahead of myself and it will all work out somehow. But I would hate to disappoint those happy little faces I saw reflected in the red glossy paint of that cute little wagon if we weren't able to swing its cost. I even tried to go for a generic cure for my car obsession. I test-drove a (gasp!) cheaper car. It was new, but it was boring. It was new, but the doors felt like they were made with aluminum when I closed them. The car was new, but it coughed and sputtered a bit when I stopped at every red light. The car was new, but I slammed my head on the inside of the car when I got out of it. This car was new, but it reminded me of a lemon and it had nothing in common with the pretty red number across the street. Generic cures don’t cure the illness that has affected my mind and body over the last few weeks. This is going to have to be the real deal. So now that I’ve found THE ONE I have to see how to make it work in reality.   It worked great in the test drive. I may have to wait a little while for something that is next-to-new or previously-leased, because I would rather wait for THE ONE than end up bitter because my fevered state made me jump and buy a lemon.  So just like all those soon-to-be-graduates I find myself preoccupied about the future. Only instead of wondering what I will be doing after graduation, I keep imagining:  "What will I do after I get the car?” “Will our family and friends like the car?” “After the car…”  Instead of Senioritis, I have New Car-itis and I'm not sure when I’ll be cured. But before the reality of making payments and driving off the lot will take away this long lasting illness, I think I'll try to enjoy it some more. Hey, do you want to go on a test drive?

      The Christian life isn't intended to be lived in isolation, but community. Let's face it though: community has its risks. Being open and honest with people can leave you just as vulnerable for attack as it leads to greater intimacy. Sometimes the people who talk the most about love seem the least likely to demonstrate it. And everyone seems to know someone who left the church because of someone's cruel behavior.  B--, the world-traveling wunderkind, recently passed the book  urlLink When Bad Christians Happen To Good People  along my way. I must have been having a bad day or something. I was interested to see what author  urlLink Dave Burchett  had to say about the wounds that get inflicted in the church everyday. Would it be an angry diatribe about every parishioner who ever sat in his pew at church? Thankfully, no.   urlLink Burchett  writes about a serious subject matter in a witty and conversational tone. He proves that being a sincere Christian and having an opinion aren't mutually exclusive. Trust me -- you'd want to sit at this guy's table at a church potluck.   urlLink Burchett  recounts some painful incidents directed at his family that made my blood boil. But he's just as quick to point out his own foibles. The book doesn't offer any deep insights -- it's more of a kick in the rear end to people who "should know better." And truthfully, I found my rear end to be the target of  urlLink Burchett's  foot on more than one occasion. Many of his illustrations hit way too close to home. I winced so many times during the reading of this book that T-- thought I had developed a facial tick.  The book is strong medicine, but a necessary prescription for a church that has forgotten its purpose is to be ever-increasingly transformed into the image of Christ.

      Have you ever enjoyed a book so much that you wished you could put copies into everyone's hands?  urlLink Abba's Child  is one such book. Nobody writes about the love of God like  urlLink Brennan Manning . This slim volume examines why so many Christians live life under a dark cloud of impending judgment rather than with a spirit of encouragement. The heart of the matter has to do with a believer's image of God -- the dispassionate judge versus the loving father. So often a person feels he can never measure up and puts on a public persona --  urlLink Manning  calls it The Impostor -- who appears to perform flawlessly. This make-believe is what robs us of true intimacy with God and genuine community with others. A much-needed book for the church today.

      "For some reason, the most vocal Christians among us never mention the Beatitudes. But, often with tears in their eyes, they demand that the Ten Commandments be posted in public buildings. And of course that’s Moses, not Jesus. I haven’t heard one of them demand that the Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes, be posted anywhere. 'Blessed are the merciful' in a courtroom? 'Blessed are the peacemakers' in the Pentagon? Give me a break!" -- Kurt Vonnegut

      Back in the day, I had a huge comic collection. I didn't collect any particular titles. I just read anything and everything --  urlLink Marvel ,  urlLink DC ,  urlLink Atlas , even the odd issue of  urlLink Archie . I remember when my den mother found out I had amassed over 100-plus comics and berated me over what a waste it was to have over $25 tied up in a comics collection! How times (and prices) have changed!  I gracefully bowed out of comic collecting after Marvel cancelled the U.S. edition of its  urlLink Doctor Who  comic. I still pick up Teen Titans Go and Justice League Adventures for my son, but I only pick up graphic novels myself now -- usually reprints of stuff from my childhood such as Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, and The New Gods. It takes something truly special to make me plunk down four or five bucks (!) on a single issue.  Avengers JLA was a four-issue miniseries that I just couldn't resist. Yeah, I'm a 36 year-old geezer who spends most of his time reading religion & philosophy, but c'mon -- I'm still an eight year-old fanboy at heart. This was a chance to see Earth's Mightiest Heroes duke it out with the World's Greatest Superheroes! I've always been a sucker for DC/Marvel Crossovers ever since I read Superman versus Spiderman in 1976.  The story starts out promising enough, with the Grandmaster challenging Krona to a game using the Avengers and the JLA as unwitting pawns. George Pérez turns out some of the best artwork I've seen in a long time and captures each character beautifully, which is no mean feat considering the large cast involved. I especially liked the sequences where the heroes switched realities and their reactions to each other's earths. The JLA is disgusted with the anarchy and corruption of the Marvel Universe, while The Avengers are speechless at the way heroes in the DC Universe are almost worshipped. Good so far. But the much anticipated battle between the superteams in issue two comes across as almost an anticlimax and the limited series never really recovers. It just got worse with each installment, like  urlLink The Matrix  movies. By issues three and four, writer Kurt Busiek dispenses with the story altogether and the comic just becomes an endless parade of cameos as -- ahem -- reality begins to shift and the rosters of the superteams keeps changing.   Avengers JLA was a great premise that unfortunately disappeared up its own rear end. Frankly, my friends and I thought up better Marvel/DC crossovers playing with our  urlLink Mego Action Figures  at recess. The only thing I regret more than reading it is the realization that I just spent $24 on four comics -- roughly the same amount I had invested in my much better collection as a third-grader!

      Have you ever watched a critically acclaimed film and wondered what the fuss was all about? Or struggled to stay awake through, much less understand, a critic's choice pick? You are not alone. I have a theory that bad films are much more enjoyable than good ones.  Bad movies have always been a part of my life. I was born in 1968 and grew up with great NYC TV shows like Creature Features, Chiller, Science Fiction Theater, and Fright Night. The new edition of  urlLink Famous Monsters of Filmland  was always a good excuse to talk a walk to the newsstand. As a fourth-grader I was in the audience when a critically-panned movie was screened at the  urlLink Library Theater  in  urlLink Warren, PA :  urlLink Star Wars . When I was in seventh grade, I happened to catch a TV interview with the Medved Brothers, who had penned the book  urlLink The Golden Turkey Awards . I quickly acquired the book and made it my goal to see as many of the dreadful films listed. When  urlLink The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film  came out a year or two later, I was in heaven.  I may never have seen  urlLink The English Patient , but I have seen  urlLink The Thing With Two Heads,   urlLink Head,   urlLink Blacula,   urlLink The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes,   urlLink Buckaroo Banzai,   urlLink The Warriors,   urlLink The Golden Voyage of Sinbad,  and  urlLink Daleks: Invasion Earth 2150 AD ! (Come to think of it, I probably watched each of those more than a few times!) I still consider the American International Pictures or  urlLink Hammer Films  logo a better stamp of approval for a movie than a dozen critics' effusive endorsements. And don't even get me started on the name  urlLink Roger Corman ...  Last night the posse and I watched  urlLink Flash Gordon . The 1980 version with hammy acting and a silly script. (When one of the Hawkmen gets hit by a laser he says, "Don't worry Flash -- he just winged me!") The version that looks like the producers calculated out exactly to the last penny how much money it would cost to pull the whole concept off and then spent exactly half that amount. The one with the soundtrack by  urlLink Queen . (My favorite track being "Football Fight.") Needless to say, we all loved it.  Is an enjoyable bad movie an oxymoron? I don't think so, provided the movie is bad in a spectacular way. Hollywood churns out plenty of unfunny comedies or boring dramas that can convince any of us to pick up the remote control and switch channels. But an enjoyable bad movie is the one you stop on while channel surfing.  urlLink A 50 foot tall woman?   urlLink Bikers desecrating a church?   urlLink Giant ants menacing Joan Collins?  "Let's see what this is all about..."  I think bad movies have all the enjoyment of good films without requiring all the emotional investment or attention span. I know that sounds terrible, but frankly I watch TV to be entertained, not to reach a state of enlightenment. That's why I read books. You may disagree with me, and that's okay because it's a free country. But if you were sitting in front of the boob tube right now with the 1980 box-office bomb  urlLink Flash Gordon  on one channel and the 1980 Academy Award winning 190-minute historical drama  urlLink Tess  on the other channel, where would you stop the remote? Case closed, I.F. wins.

      I never realized that I was an addict until the unthinkable happened yesterday: my super-fast cable modem connection died! It had been there when I disconnected the iBook to do some work in another part of the house earlier in the day, but it was gone when I reconnected it last night. I assumed the tragedy must have somehow been connected with this, and repeatedly fiddled around with my ethernet connection and cable modem. A glance at the clock surprised me that I had been doing this for about 2 1/2 hours!  The story should have ended there, but I came back to it an hour later. Then it was the first thing I checked out when I woke up this morning. While I waited for the cable repairman to get there, I couldn't stop thinking of stuff I wanted to do on the internet: check the news and weather, chat with friends, get maps, and even look up definitions of words. It's amazing to think about how quickly the internet went from being a novelty item to a must-have accessory. By odd coincidence my cell phone died at the same time. Ah, the trials and tribulations of a 21st century man...

      I had a very odd exchange the other day with someone after church. Let me first preface this by saying that the person who spoke to me is very level-headed and never, never, ever says odd things. This person isn't a Pentecostal and isn't looking for the Age of Aquarius to begin. This person isn't on any kind of medication or has mental health problems.   Anyway, here's what the person said: "When you speaking this morning, you were surrounded by a golden glow. What does that mean?" It was like that old episode of  urlLink Welcome Back Kotter  when the girl tells Horshack that he has an aura. And Horshack goes, "Great! Uh, what's an aura?"  L-- followed the whole thing up on Sunday night by doing a comprehensive and scholarly investigation of all color-related supernatural phenomena. (Actually she just did a Google search for aura.) Here's what she came up with:  There are different kinds of auras that some people claim to see. They reveal things about a person's nature. A golden aura symbolizes the intellect and an awareness of spiritual nature. It's most often found in the auras of spiritual healers and leaders. (A red aura means you're hot-to-trot. Notice my friend didn't say anything about a red color anywhere around me.)  What does my new-found aura mean to me? Well, probably nothing because I can't see it. I'm not going to tell anyone at work about it until I feel like getting fired. I'm not going to change my name to Goldie. I'm not going to write a book called "Your Aura and You." I guess it's just one of those things that make me go hmmmm...

       urlLink Adrian Plass  is a well-known writer in his native England, authoring over twenty books. Until recently, his books have been unavailable in the United States. So I couldn't wait to dig into his latest novel,  urlLink Ghosts -- The Story of a Reunion , to experience first hand what our friends on the other side of the pond have been enjoying.  A recent widower attends a reunion of his old church youth group -- people who, for the most part, haven't had much contact with each other since the late seventies. Spending the weekend in "the most haunted house in England" the friends come face to face with  how much they've changed over the years and uncover some painful traumas -- or ghosts -- from the past.  A book written with gentle humor, compassion, and honestly,  urlLink Plass  shows a lot of insight into issues facing Christians without ever turning preachy or trite.  urlLink Ghosts  is a wonderful introduction to  urlLink Mr. Plass  and I'm looking forward to reading more of his books as they become available in the States. Recommended!

      If you haven't guessed by now, I love books with a passion. But before I read grownup books -- you know, without pictures 'n' stuff -- I was a huge comic fan. I had hundreds of 'em. The funny thing is some of them haven't aged too well. There's a website devoted to some of the cheesier excesses of seventies comics and it's drop-dead funny.

       urlLink Love Feast  and  urlLink Treasure Hunt  are the last two books  urlLink Frederick Buechner  wrote about Leo Bebb, the founder of The Church of Holy Love, Incorporated. The Bebb books are hard to categorize. I always find myself describing them as hilarious and then go on to recount a plot that inevitably sounds terribly sad. So let me just avoid the whole thing this time and say that these are wonderful books and you'll live a much happier and richer life if you read them!   urlLink Love Feast  finds our characters very much out of place, speaking both geographically and emotionally. Antonio has to deal with his separation with Sharon and Bebb is adrift after the failure of his latest church venture in the northeast. That is until he becomes the Pepsi Generation's next big thing on campus through a strange series of circumstances. The book contains the best description of the gospel that I've ever read and manages to use the word "shit" over a dozen times in the process.    urlLink Treasure Hunt  is a true original: A Bebb book without Bebb. The evangelist has passed on to his heavenly reward and it is up to his family and friends to deal with the mess -- er, legacy -- he left behind. Bebb's final secrets are laid bare in the immensely satisfying end to the series.   Said it before, I'll say it again:  urlLink Frederick Buechner  is a genius. Quick -- go to  urlLink Amazon  right now and buy these books!

      Just when I think that there isn't anything on the net anymore that can impress me, I come across something like this!  urlLink Musicplasma  bills itself as "the music visual search engine." It's cool. Type in the name of a musician, hit search, and you'll be given a chart that shows what other artists or bands are in the musician's musical orbit. What a clever way to discover some new music. And what a cool way to visually represent ideas.

      I spent an enjoyable Friday evening at my friend B--'s apartment. He not only treated my family to dinner and some great conversation, but also to a few hundred pictures of his recent journeys to  urlLink Israel  and  urlLink Turkey . I was surprised to see that Israel was so green -- I always imagined that it was a big desert with sand everywhere. The pictures of Turkey were incredible. B-- showed us some homes that had been dug out of the rock faces of cliffs, which looked more like something out of a fantasy/sci-fi flick than something that exists on 21st century earth. I was surprised to see those pictures side-by-side with pictures from an internet cafe in the town of Urgup. Or photographs of nomadic Bedouin tribes with satellite dishes sitting outside their tents.  I remember back in elementary school when my teacher described the United States as "the great melting pot." Immigrants from many different cultures came together in a specific geographical location and formed a new culture over a period of decades. But the melting pot has given way to the global village. The Turkish may not be guarenteed indoor plumbing everywhere, but they can surf the net. Bedouins unwind after a hard day of camel herding by watching  urlLink Seinfeld .  Sometimes I feel like the whole world is melting and blending all around me. In my association with the church I have been exposed to many different cultures and subcultures -- Swedish, British, Hispanic, young, old, haves, have-nots, Christian, other spiritualities, and no spiritualities. I'm also affected by the global culture that gets piped into my TV, internet, and radio. On any given day I can see live satellite pictures from the middle east, chat on the computer with people from different countries, and listen to music recorded around the world on my radio.  Each culture has it's own opinions and behaviors formed by its unique experiences. That's been a rewarding if not always easy learning experience for a middle-class white kid from  urlLink Warren PA , and I know I've grown richer as a result of building these relationships. The ability of being able to see things from another point of view has made me reexamine some of my ideas and beliefs about life.  Young people tend to make decisions based on instant gratification. That's not a criticism, just an observation on life. I made decisions the same way when I was in my teens and twenties and I bet you did, too. My wife and I encourage the young people we work with to look a little farther into the future than just this school year. We make them aware that the decisions they make today will have consequences both good and bad in the future.  I was hopeless at geometry. But I do remember one thing from third period all those years ago. A vector was a change that involved both depth and direction. Encouraging a young person to look a little farther into the future will hopefully result in him being aware of the direction his life is taking. But I think it's also becoming just as necessary to encourage him to have a depth of experience with other cultures -- because how can a person have an impact on a world he doesn't seek to understand?

      Because I work every Sunday in the church, Thursday is my Friday. And I'm sure looking forward to two days off. I have a lot of things I need to do around the house and in my personal time. Like everyone else I never seem like I have enough hours in the day to get everything accomplished.  My job is actually two jobs in the same nonprofit organization -- pastor and public relations director. The workload for each job should easily warrant two full-time employees, but that's not going to happen given our current budget woes. So quite often I find myself working from crisis to crisis without ever getting to some of the not-time-sensitive items on my wish list. But today I did something very uncharacteristic. I chucked the phone calls, my email inbox, and the to-do list to follow up on something I've wanted to do for a long time: organize a voter registration drive.  My church spends approximately 75% of its efforts working with young people. I am continually impressed by their enthusiasm and dreams. Young people at my church deliver food baskets at Thanksgiving, help organize a massive Christmas effort, work at camp with inner city kids, and generally do a lot of amazing things. These aren't young people who were born with silver spoons in their mouths, but people who have overcome great obstacles in their growing up. A few months ago I was talking with some of them about current events and it was great to hear their opinions on politics. I discovered they weren't registered to vote and didn't know how to go about the process. I always intended to follow up with them about that, but it just became yet another thing that fell through the cracks of my hectic schedule.  But something inside me broke this morning as I listened to the morning news. I can't sit around and be passive while the entire world goes to hell. So I decided to organize a voter registration drive. My first call was to the  urlLink Chautauqua County Board of Elections , and my second to the  urlLink League of Women Voters . Everyone was so helpful. I discovered that the process is insanely easy -- anyone can organize a voter registration drive.  I hope to get this on the calendar before high school gets out. I'm also seeking a few high school students to get the word out via posters and the internet. Yeah, I know I have a lot more important stuff to do, like paperwork, but if I don't help these young people get involved in the political process, who will?  A lot of churches give lip service to teens and always say that "young people are the church of tomorrow." But my wife and I prefer to look on them as the church of today. I guess the voter registration drive applies that opinion to the political process. I can't wait to see how this turns out!

      I had an interesting experience recently. I was spending a leisurely Saturday afternoon browsing the racks at my  urlLink local library  when I came across a paperback wedged upside-down between two shelves. I'm a book lover, and I couldn't bear to see the little book twisted around, cover bent, pages every which way. As I reached into retrieve it a little voice inside of me said, "Read this book." So I decided to borrow it and read it before even knowing the author's name, the title, or the subject matter. I'm glad I did.  The book turned out to be  urlLink The River Within  by Jeff Imbach. A spiritual formation primer, it raises questions about the absence of passion in many Christians. Where is the life abundant promised by Christ? Quite often it's been crushed by cultural values in the church, where conformity and pat-answers are the order of the day. Imbach makes a great case for living passionately. He suggests that spiritual disciplines keep the passion moving in a life-affirming direction.  Yes, it's yet another book that encourages me to look at the totality of my life and not just the God-bits. I'm already a big proponent of experiencing God in all areas of life. Imbach's book just got me to stop feeling guilty about it. What a great message to be reminded of: God is experienced in church, prayer, and his word; but he's also experienced in nature, conversations, and circumstances. And maybe even in a library on a lazy Saturday afternoon...

      I'm not big on e-mail forwards, but I really liked this one. It was written by Dr. Kent M. Keith in 1968, and its message is maybe even more important to heed these days.:  THE PARADOXICAL COMMANDMENTS  People are illogical, unreasonable, and self-centered. Love them anyway.  If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish ulterior motives. Do good anyway.  If you are successful, you win false friends and true enemies. Succeed anyway.  The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow. Do good anyway.  Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable. Be honest and frank anyway.  The biggest men and women with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest men and women with the smallest minds. Think big anyway.  People favor underdogs but follow only top dogs. Fight for a few underdogs anyway.  What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight. Build anyway.  People really need help but may attack you if you do help them. Help people anyway.  Give the world the best you have and you'll get kicked in the teeth. Give the world the best you have anyway.

      I awoke last evening around 3 am. I felt completely rested and would have assumed that it was 7 am if I hadn't been in complete darkness. Going back to sleep wasn't going to be an option, so I got up so as to not wake my sleeping wife. The things I usually do when I can't sleep -- read, surf the net, and watch TV -- just didn't seem appropriate last night. Something else was in the air. I quietly crept downstairs and took a seat in our living room where our two children were sound asleep, the television still on. I switched it off. Our living room is beautiful. My wife transformed the walls a few years ago from a drab off-white to an inviting mustard with a scoria-colored trim. She also decorated our picture window with an odd little string of lights from  urlLink Ikea  and some gold-embossed cloth. Simple touches really, but it's just one of those amazing things she does to a room with a spare weekend on her hands. The house was in complete darkness but for the glow of the picture window, and as the light washed over me I was lost in the most beautiful feeling of bliss. I took a seat near my sleeping son and gave myself completely over to the moment. To be quite honest, I have no idea how briefly or long I sat there. I just felt a complete happiness with God. It was a time of worship and ministry that went deeper than words or intellect. I felt as if I were an empty cup and God was pouring himself into me. The moment never really passed, but I eventually made my way to a spare bedroom for a deep sleep. I awoke this morning and reflected that this must be a little of what heaven must be like.

      "How can we choose love when we have experienced so little of it? We choose love by taking small steps of love every time there is an opportunity. A smile, a handshake, a word of encouragement, a phone call, a card, an embrace, a kind greeting, a gesture of support, a moment of attention, a helping hand, a present, a financial contribution, a visit ... all these are little steps toward love. Each step is like a candle burning in the night. It does not take the darkness away, but it guides us through the darkness. When we look back after many small steps of love, we will discover that we have made a long and beautiful journey." --  urlLink Henri Nouwen , from his book  urlLink Bread for the Journey

      WARNING:  POTENTIAL 'SPOILERS' AHEAD!  Just got done watching the movie "The Fisher King" - loaned to me by our own Gizmonic Guy.  Now, I don't want to give away too much of the plot, because I AM recommending this flick to any who might not have seen it yet.  In a nutshell, it tells the story of a VERY self-centered radio 'shock-jock' (think Howard Stern - but with a harder edge).  Jack has the 'perfect life' until one of his cold-hearted bits of advice to a regular listener results in disastrous consequences.    Racked with guilt at what he inadvertently causes as a result of his mean-spiritedness (a mass murder and suicide), Jack ends up on skid row.  In fact, if it weren't for the tender mercies of the woman who takes him into her home and into her heart, he would be totally out on the street.  One night, after getting particularly 'liquored-up', Jack ends up on the wrong side of town.  He is accosted by two young hooligans who decide to douse him in gasoline and set him on fire.  Fortunately, he is rescued by the not-altogether-there homeless guy, Parry (played brilliantly by Robin Williams).    The story continues by telling the tale of how Jack tries to 'make it up' to Parry, whose wife was lost in the aforementioned murder/suicide.  Jack actually becomes a compassionate person - perhaps for the first time in his life.  He (for a time at least) ends up meeting and helping out others who, not unlike Parry, are less-fortunate and/or down-on-their-luck.  By way of review, I've got to say right off the bat that this is by no means a 'perfect' movie. It definitely could have done with a bit of judicious editing here and there, IMHO. Nonetheless, it was a brilliant story and had some great performances in it.  I thought Mercedes Ruehl (as Jack's girlfriend) was particularly good - which makes sense, I guess, seeing as how I understand that she took home an Oscar for her trouble!   Beyond all that, I thought that the themes explored in the film were exceptional!  In a lot of ways, this movie dealt with some of the basic tenets of Christianity (compassion for others, true love vs. superficial love, forgiveness, self-sacrifice, redemption, etc.), however I doubt you'll ever find it on the shelf at your local Christian bookstore.  ...Which is sad, really.  It bugs me that 'Christian entertainment' always has to be so antiseptic and whitewashed.   I wish the Christian filmmaking industry could get off their holier-than-thou butts and make some movies that would really speak to the people.  Here's what I say...meet people where they live and stop making it look like that in order to be a Christian you have to come from a smiling, happy, well-dressed, successful, middle-class, two parent and 2.5 kid family - one whose biggest 'adventure' never takes them too far out of the 'burbs.   This is where my own attitude has changed in recent years I guess.  I used to buy into the idea that all Christian media had to be 'wholesome' and have strict 'family values'.  Now that I'm older and more mature - and have been through some rather painful life changes - I realize that we as Christians need to admit that this is an imperfect world that we live in; and that to ignore the hurt and pain and suffering that are going on all around us is to deny the true message of Christ!   Jesus didn't hang out with the wealthy people of his day.  He wasn't hanging out in the suburbs with the middle-class Jews, enjoying some delicious backyard barbecue and Canaanite Cola out by the pool!  No...he was hanging out with the lepers, the prostitutes, the down-on-their-luck, the sinners!  How we as Christians today have gotten away from that simple truth, I REALLY don't understand.   This is where I butt heads with those who want the church to be a 'museum for saints' instead of a 'hospital for sinners' (as my favorite radio preacher, Pastor Greg Laurie, would put it).  Some pastors and church leaders want a tidy little whitebread church where they can show up every Sunday morning seeing well-scrubbed, well-dressed middle class white folk sitting in the pews, hands folded neatly in their laps, waiting to absorb every word that he or she 'brings down from the heavens'.   Meanwhile, some of us (including the extraordinary people behind this 'blog') see the hurt and the poverty and the neglect that is taking place all around us - and we want to reach out in Christ's love to those who are affected.  The gospel, after all, is a message of hope.  Those who are comfortable and happy don't really need hope, now do they?   All right, I'll get off my soapbox now.  Guess I just got all fired up after watching "The Fisher King".  Whaddayaknow...I guess this film touched me pretty deeply.  Amazing, isn't it, that God can use a secular movie to make me feel like I need to seek after him more closely?  But then again, that's His style, isn't it?  ...Using the 'foolish' things of the world to confound the wise?  (1 Corinthians 1:27)   Check this movie out sometime.  See if it doesn't make you think (at the very least) or maybe even change your worldview (at best)!

      It's not too often that we see a poem (other than Lamont's) grace this blog, but I came across this one in the book  urlLink Beliefs and Blasphemies  and thought it was playful and fun. It's by Virginia Hamilton Adair.  GAMES WITH GOD  I played, a child both wild and meek, with God at games of hide-and-seek. I searched in vain the usual places and found a thousand saddened faces.  "Your God is hidden in heaven," they said; "You'll see him only when you're dead." How could I make them understand God often took me by the hand? Then as my tears began to fall I felt his touch and heard his call, "I never hid from you at all."  I played with God a game of tag, his mantle flying like a flag. I gave my God a good head start but caught him running in my heart.   I played with God the game "I Spy," but lost him with my fading eye, till playmate God in his pure kindness, printed his image on my blindness.

      T-- and I attended our graduation ceremony last Sunday. Barely. We were coming off a long weekend spent at camp in Penn Yan with the young people from church and we had a late start on the road. Then we missed the turn for the NYS Thruway and wasted a half hour cruising around the Fingerlakes. But all our anxiety was for nothing (as usual) as we ended up at the Buffalo State College campus with a few minutes to spare.  We were quickly ushered into a basement hallway where we put on our gowns and caps. I felt a little foolish as I took a look at myself reflected in a window pane. I kept feeling the urge to say, "Welcome to Hogwarts," to everyone I saw. We lined up and proceeded to walk into the auditorium.  After a half-dozen speeches we were called to the stage one by one to shake a few hands and receive a pin and a medallion. The medallion is really cool looking. Does everyone get one when they graduate? I thought I would just get a piece of paper. Then it was time to say visit with the faculty and get some pictures with family.  I originally hadn't planned on going to graduation. It just seemed like a waste of money and time. Because  urlLink Empire State College  is a distance learning school without a campus we were using another college's auditorium, and it wasn't like this was going to be my last chance to socialize with my classmates because I had never met any! Plus, as anyone who has ever visited my church will attest, I don't go in much for ceremony!  But T-- talked me into it because my favorite professor was speaking. And I'm so glad I went. It provided me an opportunity to celebrate with family and friends. And even though I had received my diploma in the mail months ago, I hadn't yet experienced the sense of accomplishment that I felt on Sunday afternoon. Now I actually feel like "I graduated."  Maybe there's a lesson in all this. So often I just rush from one commitment to another. Perhaps I would feel a little more satisfaction in life if I paused for a moment to appreciate the accomplishment of a job well done before jumping headfirst into the next thing on my to-do list.

      This is a team We need to work as one. Our focus, funtion and motivation centered on the center.  This is a team Not a solo act With middlemen, hucksters and clowns Hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder Strong and commanding.  This is a team But my burden seems too heavy My input isn’t equaling what my output should be.  My team needs to pick me up, Carry me to the sidelines Allow me to rest by the Gatorade cooler…  This is my team, my life, and my hope. Cover my back while I catch my breath.

      Nothing makes such drudgery as a day spent around angry people. Work, for a variety of reasons, has turned into an emotional minefield of late, resulting in a variety of "friendly fire" incidents. I've been asked to intervene in a particular situation in which neither party will even consider the possibility that the other person might not be entirely at fault. I'm working with a father and son who aren't on speaking terms. My circle of friends is dealing with the emotional mushroom cloud that continues to fallout from a person with real passive/aggressive issues. My wife and I are taking a group of high school students on a retreat this weekend, which usually results in one good blowup between young people.  Will I sound too much like Stuart Smalley if I ask "Why can't we all just get along?" It's not that anyone seems to be enjoying all this warfare -- with the exception of Ms. Passive/aggressive -- but nobody wants to lay down their arms, either.  Maybe we'd all do a lot better if we heeded the words of author Frederick Buechner: "Of the Seven Deadly Sins, anger is possibly the most fun. To lick your wounds, to smack your lips over grievances long past, to roll over your tongue the prospect of bitter confrontations still to come, to savor to the last toothsome morsel both the pain you are given and the pain you are giving back -- in many ways it is a feast fit for a king. The chief drawback is that what you are wolfing down is yourself. The skeleton at the feast is you..."

      Okay, I'll admit it: I've been dieting for the last month. It was something that I've wanted to do -- uh, desperately needed to do -- for a very long time.  I've always known that weight loss wasn't something I could accomplish all on my own. I'd need to be accountable to someone who could teach me healthy eating habits and monitor my progress.  And that's been the rub for years. It takes a lot of courage for me to admit to another person that I need help. It's kind of comical, really -- a 300 + lbs. guy who was afraid to tell anyone that he needed to lose weight. As if no one would notice if I kept my mouth shut, right?  I finally chose a weight-loss center that didn't require me to buy supplements or special food. Because the way I think of it, a diet is something you have to be able to live on. You can't starve yourself until you reach your goal weight and then go right back to the Golden Arches. The plan has worked for me so far: I never feel like I'm starving, I feel a lot better physically, I've dropped 21 lbs. and my blood pressure is down.  I also benefit from the accountability of the center. I have to go weigh-in three times a week which gives me that little extra push that I need to stay on course. The clinicians also ask me questions about how the diet is going, etc. One question that never fails to crack me up though is "When was your last bowel movement?"  I understand that when you're weighing a person three times a week that the amount of stool they're carrying around can throw all their measurements off. But c'mon -- even for the most noble of purposes, how should I respond to that kind of question?  Sometimes I make jokes:  "Just an hour ago. It was GREAT!"  or  "I haven't since yesterday. It's as if I have a cork inside of me. And I'm not one of the 'one in seven guys' who enjoys that sort of thing!"  or  "Just what exactly constitutes a bowel movement?"  I can always get one of the clinicians to laugh, but the other two somehow are able to maintain a stoic expression akin to a Buckingham Palace Guard. So I sheepishly whisper, "Today," as I stare at the floor.  One time I was horrified to answer the question because I hadn't gone since the day before. So I did what any well-adjusted college graduate would do: I LIED. I don't know why, but I was just too embarrassed to admit that I hadn't gone to the can since the day before. It's not like I expected her to call the police or put on a pair of rubber gloves and bring out a hose. Which one in seven guys enjoys, by the way.  Isn't it strange how embarrassed I get about normal things? (It just occurred to me that although I obsessively blog about most everything, it took me more than a month to address the diet in the blog.)  So here it is, world... I'm going to come clean about myself: I'm fat, I'm on a diet, and I have bowel movements... but not everyday!

      It's been a lot of fun having B-- home from the Air Force. In what's quickly becoming a Friday night tradition, we just chilled out, ate pizza and watched old movies. We passed on our usual choice of  urlLink Mystery Science Theater 3000  and went with the double feature of  urlLink Things To Come  and  urlLink The House That Dripped Blood .  I only knew of  urlLink Things To Come  by its reputation, and have to confess that I really wasn't all that eager to watch a slow paced film from 1936. But I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It rocked! Very fluid camera moves, great special effects (especially the dogfight sequence) and a fast paced story. I tried imagining what it was like to watch this in the thirties -- what a spectacle -- it must have been  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow  of it's time. The story runs a little out of steam as mankind moves into its utopian existence, but the first 2/3 is impressive. (Although B-- and I couldn't figure out for the life of us why someone would want to start a revolt because of "progress." Anyone have any ideas?) It's a shame that the film has fallen into the public domain. This is a film that deserves a better presentation than the awful print used to make the DVD!  Our second feature arrived in the mail today:  urlLink The House That Dripped Blood . I had a full house for this one -- my wife and kids, B-- and D--, a guy from church. I'm not sure what they all thought of it -- after all, Amicus Films are an acquired taste. But they seemed to enjoy it well enough. Me, on the other hand -- I love  urlLink British horror flicks , no matter how corny or implausible they get.  Well, B-- isn't off to college for a few more weeks -- hopefully we can get a few more double features in before then!

      Every writer goes through a dry spell, and I guess the last few weeks have been mine. Where I once couldn't wait to make a  urlLink Blogger  entry, if I think of blogging at all, it just seems like kind of a chore. And as chores go, mowing the lawn will score me a lot more points with the family and neighbors!  I looked at some other blogs today for inspiration and made a few discoveries:  1.  Sex in a blog is an all or nothing proposition.  Really. There is no middle ground. A blogger will go on and on about politics, religion, their favorite food, and the smell of their own farts, but no mention of sex will be found. I just can't imagine that there are that many gender neutral people blogging. The only blogs I came across that mentioned sex feature it as an exclusive topic, as if the writers do nothing else during the day but go from escapade to escapade. I found it odd to discover that blogs are written either by sexless manequins or people that go at it like jackrabbits 24/7.   2.  A blog can get you fired.  No kidding. Did you know that there are people naive enough to post from work computers or MicroSoft employees who post pictures of product development on the web? It's kind of asking for it, don't you think? On the other hand, it's less than satisfying to read postings about a generic workplace that gives no clue as to whether it's a gas station or a government think tank.  3.  You can make different blogs for different topics.   urlLink Blogger  offers the option of doing multiple blogs. I guess in a perfect world I would have one exclusively for posting my musings on religion and a different one for my love of cheesy horror and sci-fi flicks. But that's who I am. I can spend an afternoon writing my Sunday sermon and then watch  urlLink Day of the Triffids  that evening. It may not be a picture that always makes sense, but I prefer to put the whole jumbled mess out there and let you, the reader, figure it out.  Just like all writing, I guess it all comes down to these questions: How much of myself am I willing to reveal? Am I writing for an audience, or for myself? Am I willing to pay the price for troubling the waters?

      Er, maybe that should read   calling all fellow nerds.   The first new series of  urlLink Doctor Who  in fifteen years has begun filming this week. I watched this show religiously back in the 70s and 80s. It will be nice to finally see some new adventures on our TV screens soon. The special effects team also worked on the film  urlLink Gladiator , so the series will finally have some nice-looking special effects for a change. I do have to confess, though, that it will take some getting used to a Doctor who's ditched the old-fashioned clothes for a t-shirt and leather jacket!  Can a revival of  urlLink Mystery Science Theater 3000  be far behind?

      No one will ever forget the dreadful images of September 11, 2001.  Drawn to the nearest television by a phone call or a shout from a co-worker down the hall, Americans and viewers around the world stared in disbelief at the billowing smoke coming from the World Trade Center's North 110 Floor Tower. But nothing could prepare them for the shock that came moments later as United Airlines Flight 175 slammed into the complex's South Tower. Within an hour and a half, both towers were no more than a gigantic tomb of rubble for thousands of dead and missing.   As I struggled with the same mixture of grief and outrage shared almost universally by people everywhere, I was struck by the odd thought that because of television, so many people saw history being made -- live -- as it happened.  Sure, plenty of people have seen history-making events before on the evening news, but usually as a replay filmed or taped earlier in the day. Many events, such as the moon landing or the presidential elections, although broadcast live, have been scheduled in advance. Other newsworthy stories, such as military actions and natural disasters, are of such a long duration that getting pictures to the public isn’t that much more of an accomplishment than movie theater newsreels of the 1930s and 40s.  The attack on the World Trade Center was different. It was live spot news of an immense proportion. It delivered something that other media -- newspaper, radio and internet -- couldn’t deliver: the actual, history-making image as it happened. It’s no wonder that we instinctively reach for the remote in times of crisis.  Television news is ubiquitous. The other evening the restless insomniac that I am awoke at 3am and stumbled to my television set. Interspersed between reruns of “Matlock” and better-buns-and-abs infomercials were two network news broadcasts, one local broadcast, and a CNN re-feed on a bargain-basement UHF outlet. And that was just the over–the–air channels.  Taking a glance at my TV guide, I noted that a cable–connected news junkie could have scored a fix with CNN, CNN Headline News, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC. A commercial-induced withdrawal could be curbed by flipping over to "the niche news channels" like CNNFN, CNNSI, Court TV, Empire Sports Network, ESPN, ESPN 2 and the Weather Channel. Finally, the news junkie could come down from his information-overloaded high and be lulled to sleep by unedited highlights of the day's conferences and speeches on C-SPAN 1 & 2.  It’s almost hard to believe (or remember, as the case may be) that things weren’t always this way at all. Throughout the 20s, 30s and most of the 40s, television was little more than an experimental curiosity indulged in by educational and industrial organizations and a small group of wealthy viewers.   It’s not that people didn’t recognize the potential of the new device. Chairman of RCA David Sarnoff remarked in 1939, "The emotional appeal of pictures to the mass of people is everywhere apparent. (Kisseloff, 349-50)" But if the medium of television was ever going to find mass acceptance, it was going to have to broadcast something more intriguing than fuzzy pictures of Niagara Falls on an intermittent basis.  The development of a viable commercial television system was slow in coming to the United States. Not surprisingly, World War Two brought serious progress to a halt (Abramson, 31). But post-war television was hardly a boom–time, either: much time was spent fighting government anti–trust regulation, industry bickering over frequencies and competing standards, and, most importantly, in the minds executive boards everywhere: just how was this going to make any money (Boddy, 37-41)?     1948 is widely regarded as the year that broadcasters and the public really jumped head first into the ocean of commercial television. Television networks and stations met the public’s eager demand for shows with a variety of live programs: theater plays, musical showcases, stand–up comedy, soap operas and yes, news and public affairs programming.   The 1948 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia was broadcast to nine states via “stratovision” -- whereby “the signal was beamed up to a plane flying 25,000 feet above Pittsburgh… (Wilk, 97)” Following the critical acclaim of those broadcasts, the TV networks were eager to get involved with a regular schedule of news programs.   Douglas Edwards, known within the radio industry as more of an announcer than a reporter, was the face of CBS TV News. But what passed for network news in those days bares little resemblance to today’s spectacles. “…the Edwards show of those early years hardly even qualified as a television newscast. There were no television correspondents in the field and no network camera crews to film the stories. Except for wars, floods, and other catastrophes that, because of their duration retained a certain timeliness, there was little attempt to cover spot news. About 90 percent of a typical Edwards broadcast consisted of Edwards reading the news.” (Gates, 56)  NBC’s Meet The Press took advantage of early TV’s studio–bound limitations and became the longest-running news program on the air. A simple format, still followed today, consists of a few interviewers grilling a public figure on the important events of the day. Some notable guests of its first decade included Menachem Begin, Sen. Joseph McCarthy, Richard Nixon and Fidel Castro (Ball).  NBC’s entry into broadcast news is perhaps today remembered more for its sponsor than its content. The Camel News Caravan, hosted by the folksy John Cameron Swayze, made extensive use of newsreels (Bliss, 222-3). While the footage wasn’t always of the timeliest variety, it was at least a step in the right direction, playing towards the strengths of television broadcasting.   Other notable broadcasts of the first decade of television news included Edward R. Murrow’s See It Now, The Today Show (which accomplished the impossible feat of getting people to watch news in the morning -– even if it took a monkey to do it!), and CBS Reports. Of particular note is ABC’s unprecedented and uninterrupted coverage of the McCarthy hearings, viewed by over 80 million people (Streitmatter 168).  “Calling ABC’s televising of the hearings an act of enormous public service, Jack Gould wrote in the New York Times: ‘No viewer sitting in front of his screen can be unaware of the television’s tremendous role in the hearings – politically, educationally and socially. The television audience constitutes the real jury. Whatever the viewer’s personal political predilections, he is his own eye-witness, reporter and judge.” (Streitmatter 165)   In just a few short years the growth of the television industry forced its “big-brother,” radio, out of the general entertainment category and into a mostly local record–based format that it still, more or less, follows to this day (Emery 376). It kept audiences in their living rooms and out of the movie houses and live entertainment venues (Emery 393-5). It even began taking a large dent out of newspaper and magazine advertising revenue eventually resulting in the cancellation of The Saturday Evening Post and Collier’s (Emery 387).  With the increased audience and subsequent rise in revenues, funds were readily available for the development of new technologies that directly benefited news production: the Teleprompter -– which allowed anchormen to read their script without breaking eye–contact with the camera, color, magnetic sound, and coaxial connections from coast–to–coast that allowed networks to broadcast live news events to every affiliate at the same time (Kisseloff, 373).  “In 1947, only 1 percent of American homes had a television.” (Streitmatter 159) The 1950s saw television make great inroads with the American public. In 1952 “more than 34 percent of the homes -- fifteen million -- had television sets. By the end of the decade this figure was 86 percent.” (Emery 370) But the ubiquitous box in the living room was soon to be more than the trendy appliance to have.  Within fifteen years of its commercial inception, television news was no longer a novelty or hit–or–miss experiment in progress; it was a necessity for a nation in crisis. As Fred Friendly, then head of CBS News, recalled in the book Television:   “Those four days of massive television coverage of the Kennedy funeral held the nation together. A nation which had a forty-year old president shot from under them was in danger of disintegrating in an emotional tantrum...  "I think it was broadcasting's finest hour. And I think it might have saved this country... People at all three networks made the decision: no commercials, and more important, no entertainment programs. Television was for those four days the sinew, the stabilizing force, the gyroscope that held the country together.” (Winship, 218)  WORKS CITED  Abramson, Albert. "The Invention of Television."

      May 10, 1869 -- Promontory Summit, Utah. The chief engineer of the Union Pacific Railroad drives the final spike connecting his line to the Central Pacific Railroad. While not yet qualifying the westward pioneers for Amtrak Guest Rewards, it does reduce their treacherous six–month journey to a six–day train ride. The United States becomes a little bit “smaller” as the coasts are connected by rail.  Eighty years later, another event connecting east and west occurred, but it’s rarely (if ever) mentioned in the history books: the first television broadcast seen simultaneously on both coasts of the United States, as chronicled in the book The Press and America: An Interpretive History of the Mass Media (370).  Coast-to-coast broadcasting was made possible with the development of coaxial cable. The first lines had been laid by 1946 between New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, and by 1947 to Boston. By 1948 the Midwest was included so that network shows were received simultaneously in the middle and eastern parts of the nation. Finally, in 1951, AT&T completed a microwave relay system to the West Coast, in time for President Truman to address the San Francisco peace conference that ended the Pacific war in September. That speech was carried by 94 stations. Regular network broadcasting followed, and one of the first shows to be aired was Edward R. Murrow’s See It Now.  It’s a shame that this “golden spike” is so neglected in our cultural literacy. In my opinion, the development of broadcasting technology has at the very least had as much of an effect on the social change and development of this country as the transcontinental railroad.  I think that this event is quite often overlooked because the general public doesn’t understand the intricacies of television technology, and that people have forgotten to what extent the presentation of the medium has improved over the years.   In television news, electronic technology and the gathering and the presentation of the news are forever intertwined. In my previous paper, TV News: Its Birth and Infancy, I wrote about television’s first regular news broadcast: CBS TV News, a rather pedestrian affair that seemed to consist entirely of Douglas Edwards sitting at a desk smoking a cigarette. The visual design would occasionally kick into overdrive with the addition of -- now, sit down for this -- a map or a globe.  From a twenty–first century perspective, CBS TV News, Camel News Caravan, and the other early attempts at the news aren’t very riveting television. Archival rebroadcasts beg the modern viewer to ask, “Didn’t they know how to ‘do’ television back then?”  There are some good arguments to be made:  Why have Doug Edwards read excerpts from the State of the Union instead of just playing footage of President Truman outlining his “fair deal?”  How about a live report from China about the end of its bloody civil war?  What about a split–screen live debate between egghead sociologists in different cities about the impact apartheid would have on South Africa?  The truth of the matter is that the technology necessary to produce any of the aforementioned scenarios simply didn’t exist in the forties and early fifties. Just as Johann Gutenberg wasn’t cranking out four–color offset printed Bibles on glossy paper in 1455, the advent of television broadcasting didn’t bring with it color, magnetic sound, microwave relays, satellite uplinks and downlinks, digital switchers, and videotape.   That’s to say nothing of the human resources necessary to make a visually–impacting broadcast –- in television’s earliest days the industry didn’t even have its own film cameramen, relying instead on newsreel companies for actualities, and even then only events of a long duration.  Pioneer TV journalists were hampered in their presentation of the news by the scant technological resources of their time.   Just read what it took to spruce up a newscast with some film footage:  It was a terrible thing to get film on the air. Let’s say an airplane crashed in Dallas, Texas... We had to figure out airline schedules. Then, we had motorcycle couriers at the airports to get the film from the stewardess or the pilot.  You got the lab to turn down all other business and stand by with the machines all threaded up and ready to go. They’d slap the film on there and edit it quickly...  We would then write the script, put it in the can, and start a mad dash down Park Avenue in a Red Jeepster. We’d get to the RCA Building, and they’d be holding an elevator. ‘Here it comes through!’ It was like gangbusters every night of the week. Sometimes we wouldn’t make it. (Kisseloff 365)  With ulcer-creating scenarios like this being played out by television producers on a daily basis, no wonder the first great advancement of television news was the ability to transmit stories across a network of coaxial cable! But all joking aside, for the television industry to fulfill the public’s expectation of being the “window on the world,” it would had to create a more reliable and instantaneous way of delivering news actualities from around the country.  As previously mentioned, coaxial cable and microwave relays expanded the network’s capabilities. Journalistic icon Edward R. Murrow utilized the technology to startling effect on his first edition of See It Now by showing live pictures of New York and San Francisco simultaneously. (Emery 372) While not part of a news story per se, Murrow demonstrated the possibility of the new electronic tools.  The technology also helped bring down a threat to the American way of life. At the height of Joe McCarthy’s witch hunt, many newspapers and reporters were so fearful of being labeled communist sympathizers that they were basically running his press releases verbatim. (Streitmatter 157-8) What might have happened to America if television hadn’t stepped in?  ABC [provided] gavel–to–gavel coverage of the most explosive congressional hearings in American history. For more than a month, ABC held eighty million viewers riveted to their televisions as the unforgiving camera revealed McCarthy to be a rude and sadistic bully. By the time the hearings ended, McCarthyism had been relegated to the history books. (Streitmatter, 154)  A modern-day monster brought down by a fourth-rate TV network. ABC wouldn’t have been able to get away with a critical analysis of McCarthy -- it just didn’t have the clout back then. But by utilizing the technology to run a live and unfiltered feed into people’s homes, the tide of public opinion was turned.  Within a decade, the coaxial network was superseded by a system of satellites, adding a global as well as national perspective into the news. But the impact and result remained the same. Television  now communicated to viewers through images, sometimes brutal images of current events. It made people aware of the brutal reality of black oppression (Streitmatter 171) and the senseless conflict in Vietnam (Streitmatter 187) in a way that an announcer behind a desk reading a script never could.  Just like the transcontinental railroad brought the country closer together, the United States -- and the world -- became a little bit “smaller” as communities were connected by television.

      Love invades and topsy-turvy 	Everything goes wervy-mervy. Loss interrupts delivering pain 	All the work goes down the drain. Laughter intrudes, sings too loud 	Shouting above the din of the crowd. Anguish alters reality’s rhyme 	Setting everything off off time. Anxiousness distracts good intentions 	With flustered answers to too many questions. Ability can increase or decrease might, 	As commitments carry into the night. Hopes haunted, fears challenged, 	Everyone watching this seems to be astounded. Wandering worry, wished wane 	My crazy life that is happy, sad and SANE.

      I've spent the better part of the last two weeks convincing my seven-year old how beneficial a week at summer camp would be. Let's just say that he wasn't easily convinced -- after all, it would be his first time away from home. But through a strange coincidence, my denomination held a family day for clergy at this very camp today. My son had an immediate rapport with the new camp director and was also impressed with the pool, the mini-golf park, and the gymnasium. He also realized that he already knows about 8 members of the staff, who come from our home church. So suddenly, he's very excited about beginning sleepaway camp tomorrow. Of course, I'm now the one who's having second thoughts about sending my baby boy away for six whole days!!! SOB!!!

      This last week has been good.  T-- and I made it a special point this week to live in the present moment. I think we actually managed to spend the last seven days without having a discussion about work! Instead we tried something new -- we enjoyed ourselves with whatever we were doing at the moment.  Take yesterday for example. As we were driving from  urlLink Jamestown  to the  urlLink Buffalo/Niagara  region, it kind of occurred to us that we had never actually decided what we were going to do when we got there! So we drove around until we got to the  urlLink Castellani Art Museum  on the campus of  urlLink Niagara University . It was an interesting collection primarily made up of pieces after 1980. There was a fantastic large installation called Waterfall by Patrick Robideau, which was composed of dozens of old trunks stacked atop one another. However, I was most impressed by the small pieces of mixed media by Gerald Meade. And then for something completely different, we made our way to  urlLink Old Fort Niagara  for a walking tour.  The Teacher in Eccleiastes wrote, "Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might." So often I've only thought of that quote in relation to my employment, but I now see that it's just as valid for rest and recreation. Maybe even more vaild. So often I feel guilty during my "downtime" and seek to fill it with some sort of productive activity. But this week has me seeing time off in a different light -- as a Sabbath which is just as important to my family's well-being as putting groceries on the table.  Did I already say it's been good?  urlLink The Genesee Country Village & Museum...  Swimming (and grilling) at my mom's house, playing action figures with my son, going out to eat, watching movies, and even just taking a nap. Whatever we did this week, we did wholeheartedly, and it brought us closer together and more ready for the challenges in the months ahead. But I'm not going to think about that now -- I have a whole day of vacation left to meet some friends at their new church, hit the pool, watch a monster movie, and maybe even catch a nap!

      My love of bad movies is legendary. As a kid, I once hitchhiked home from camp so I could catch a 2 am showing of  urlLink The Thing With Two Heads . Years later, it was the first movie I purchased on DVD.  Imagine my joy and excitement yesterday as I browsed the aisles at my local  urlLink Best Buy  and saw a copy of  urlLink The Monster Club  on DVD for $9.99. Released directly to TV in America,  urlLink The Monster Club  was a stepchild of the  urlLink Amicus horror anthologies  of the 60s and 70s. The movie is a who's who of horror:  urlLink Roy Ward Baker ,  urlLink Vincent Price ,  urlLink John Carradine ,  urlLink Simon Ward ,  urlLink Geoffrey Bayldon ,  urlLink Donald Pleasence ,  urlLink Britt Ekland ,  urlLink Patrick Magee , and  urlLink Roy Ashton . Add a great soundtrack by a bunch of bands that never broke in America, and you've got an evening of prime entertainment!  This movie really takes me back to the early 1980s. We were the first family on our block to have one of those newfangled VCRs (a Montgomery Ward!) and one of the first things I ever recorded was  urlLink The Monster Club  off of  urlLink WOR-TV . I've probably watched this flick a couple dozen times over the course of my life and it's as nostalgic for me as looking at my high school yearbook. This isn't a great movie. It's a movie that's so bad it's great! Remember -- MONSTERS RULE O.K.!!!

      "Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it's like to live inside somebody else's skin. It is the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too." - Frederick Buechner in his book Wishful Thinking

      I may not own a TARDIS, but I still managed to spend the second day of my vacation traveling through time. The extended family and I spent an enjoyable day at the  urlLink Genesse Country Village and Museum  in Mumford, New York. It's a massive collection of historical homes and businesses that have been moved to a piece of property just shy of Rochester, NY. All of the buildings have been carefully refurbished and furnished, and many of them have tour guides who will give you the history of the site. Pretty cool.  There is a real sense of peace that rests there. Exploring an austere Quaker meeting house and imagining the people who worshipped there, petting the animals, smelling the rosewater and walking the the garden at the Shaker Trustees' Building... I was amazed at the ingenuity of early settlers in the day-to-day business of daily living. It's a way of life forever closed to me. After all, I wouldn't survive a month on the frontier because I don't know anything about planting a garden, working with my hands, or, well, virtually anything I would need to do to live!  Yet there is such a purity, a "rightness" about that way of life that I hunger for. I can't help but wonder that for all our technological advances -- are we really better off?

      I began my vacation today. It is a welcome relief after a particular busy month, where T-- and I found ourselves working every weekend.  Today, I was as unproductive as a rock. Since yesterday was a fourteen-hour day spent doing our Sunday meeting and picking kids up from summer camp, we wisely didn't plan any big activities for day one. So I spent the day in rest and relaxation -- mostly naps punctuated by brief periods of eating. Just when I thought that the day couldn't get any better, I discovered that  urlLink Turner Classic Movies  was showing a marathon of sci-fi cult favorites like  urlLink Village of the Damned ,  urlLink Twenty Million Miles to Earth , and  urlLink Forbidden Planet . (The girls contented themselves upstairs with daytime TV.)  I'm enjoying myself. It feels so good to slow down after pushing myself for so long -- and I still have six days left!

      Has anyone out there noticed the total lack of attention span in society today? From minute rice to the sitcom, people have found more and more ways to speed up their life. Everyone is in such a hurry. I've seen women putting their make-up on while driving in traffic, I mean come on!!! One bump and bam... there goes her eye. But it doesn't seen to matter to these people how dangerous or fruitless these things can be, they are compelled to shave a second off here and there in some great rush. But what are they rushing to? What's the big frickn' hurry?  I think the ultimate example of this stupidity is the cell phone. Now, let me just say that some people (doctors, etc.) really need these things. But is everybody so starved for time that they can't call somebody from home or the office? Or, God forbid, stop over and talk to someone in person. Is their brain going to explode if they have a couple moments of silence? Its insane.  It seems like nobody reads books anymore, they take up too much time. So they miss out on great ideas and stories so they can watch another reality show. They can't stop and read a newspaper or journal, nope too busy for that. So they only hear a 10 second news clip when its interrupting their favorite radio station. So we have a lot of ignorant people waking around that only believe what they're told because they don't have time to form their own opinion.  What ever happened to "stopping and smelling the roses"? We need to make sure that in our constant rush towards... whatever... that we don't miss important things in life and in the process fail to appreciate what we already have.

      HARDER...FASTER...MORE, MORE, MORE!!!  Sorry...oldest trick in the book.  No, my article this week is NOT about what you might think.  But you've got to admit that the title above beats my original choice of "Spider-man vs. Van Helsing".  - A little too 'geeky', right?  I had also considered going with "Making a Summer Blockbuster The RIGHT Way".  ...Just not quite as attention-grabbing, eh?  Anyways, you've probably already guessed by now what I'm 'ranting and raving' about this week.  The 'rave' is for one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, "Spider-man 2".  The 'rant' is for the abysmal "Van Helsing".  These two summer blockbusters - in my opinion - represent all that is right - and all that is WRONG - with Hollywood's thinking these days.   Let's start with "Van Helsing".  I went into this movie with the expectation that it would either go to one extreme or the other.  Nevertheless, as a fan of classic horror movies, I actually had high hopes for the film.  I could see where it would have a lot of potential.  I mean, think about it.  You've got exclusive access to three of the classic monsters from Universal Studios's great horror films of the thirties and forties:  Frankenstein, Dracula, and the Wolf Man; AND you even have rights to use characters such as Dr. Jeckyll and his evil alter-ego, Dr. Hyde.  Combine these legendary villians with the exciting visual capabilities afforded by the new computer-generated digital effects.  Sounds like a winning combination, yes?   Then take the character of Van Helsing - traditionally played as an older, more 'scholarly' vampire hunter - and portray him as a younger 'man-of-action' type.  Write a bone-chilling, action-packed story where Van Helsing is on the hunt for the 'terrible trio', then sit back and watch the box office receipts come in.  Sounds like a 'no-brainer', doesn't it?  Well...a 'no-brainer' is exactly what Universal delivered!  I sat through the two-hour plus "Van Helsing" constantly looking at my watch - just waiting for something to happen.  Now don't get me wrong - PLENTY of stuff was actually happening on the screen.  Nevertheless, nothing really happened.  Not following me?  Let me elaborate.  I must admit that "Van Helsing" has at least ONE rather dubious achievement to its credit.  I can guarantee you that I have never seen a more 'action-packed' movie.  Action-packed in the sense that every single frame of the film was just FILLED with ridiculously over-the-top action.  I don't think there was even ONE completely expository scene in the film where things calmed down for a moment.  Even in the 'quietest' moments, there was always SOMETHING going on in the background.  Basically, "Van Helsing" was a relentless assault on the senses!  Stuff was constantly blowing up, burning, oozing, flying, screaming, howling, - all at billion-decibel sound levels!  Apparently all of the 'noise and smoke' was meant to cover the fact that nobody had actually ever bothered to write a story for the movie.  What precious little story there WAS was lifted from just about every source imaginable - starting with a painful rip-off of the James Bond character, 'Q'.  Just as Agent 007 always stops by Q's lab to 'suit-up' for a mission, so too does Van Helsing stop in at the mysterious laboratory hidden beneath the Vatican (don't ask!) to prepare for battle.  The only difference here is that his weapons and gadgets are slightly more 'period' - rapid-shooting crossbows, for example.  How original!  I don't know about you, but I am so tired of Hollywood films like this - they seem to think that the audience is too stupid to care about a movie actually having an original story.  Heck, just throw a whole bunch of digital effects up on the screen - and make sure the soundtrack is mind-numbingly loud - and everyone will be happy, right?  - WRONG!!!  And what ever happened to writing some characters that you could actually care about?  All of the characters in "Van Helsing" are SO one-dimensional.  In fact, just three months after seeing the film, I couldn't tell you the name of any of the characters in it (well - apart from Van Helsing himself, obviously!).  Seeing as how the producers of this film apparently envisioned Van Helsing as a cross between a  James Bond and an Indiana Jones, why didn't they at least go the extra mile and give Van Helsing some of these characters' faults and foibles.  Instead, he's just a cardboard-cutout 'action hero'.  The part might as well be played by a CGI (Computer Generated Image) character instead of by Hugh Jackman - who actually IS a very talented actor, in my opinon.  It's also interesting to note that, for a movie that deals with monsters from classic horror movies, there's nary a scare to be found.  In fact, throughout the entire ordeal (as I'll henceforth refer to the process of actually sitting through this type of tedium), I only jumped twice; and both of those times I wasn't actually scared.  - I was just reacting to a couple of mind-numbingly loud noises that blasted forth from the Dolby THX Ultra Magna-Power Sensurround Megawatt soundtrack!  Alright, one more gripe about the mindless morass that IS "Van Helsing" and then I'll turn my attention to the one that 'got it right'.  My complaint is this:  why is it that every action movie since "The Matrix" has to feature these crazy fight scenes where everyone has superhuman abilities to manuever in mid-air?!?  Granted, it's fun to watch such crazy gravity-defying scenes, but it just doesn't make sense that EVERYONE in films suddenly has these magical powers to disobey all the laws of nature!   And just what was the deal with the horse-drawn carriage race in this flick?  While watching action flicks over the years, I've been able to accept a wide variety of motor vehicles (cars, trucks, motorcycles, etc.) jumping enormous gorges; but I just don't think that a team of horses pulling a carriage are all that capable of flying across enormous distances.  I don't care HOW much of a 'head of steam' they may have built up!  Yet another example of throwing logic to the wind, I guess; but that's OK...us stupid people in the audience don't know no better, now does we?!?  You know, I'm a firm believer in the fact that not EVERY movie has to be a "Sophie's Choice" or a "Driving Miss Daisy".  I think there's definitely a place for movies that are just mindless escapism.  I can't even begin to tell you how much I enjoyed "Dude, Where's My Car?".  Of course, when you go into a film like THAT, you pretty much expect things to be goofy and over-the-top.  However, I prefer my action films served up with a side of intelligence.   And I think it goes without saying that the one true Unforgiveable Sin in filmmaking is insulting the audience's intelligence.  I recall giving a friend of mine a one-sentence review of "Van Helsing" by saying, "it probably would have been my favorite movie ever if I was still 8 years old."  Of course, who knows...maybe that WAS the target audience for "Van Helsing" - 8-to-10 year old boys!      Alright, enough Hollywood-bashing.  Now it's time to offer up some praise for a truly GREAT summer blockbuster-type film, "Spider-man 2".  Proving that it IS possible to make an action film that can appeal to people well into the double-digits age-wise, "Spider-man 2" hit me like a breath of fresh air!   Hollywood finally got it right!  Now I don't want to discount the awesomeness of the first "Spider-man" release.  It was also an incredible film.  However, I think the general consensus is that the second "Spidey" is exponentially better than the first.  Nevertheless, BOTH are shining examples of how to blend action, drama, comedy, and pathos into a cohesive whole.   So let's examine what makes this film in particular so much better than its fellow 'blockbuster' "Van Helsing".  I think I can summarize it in 5 points:  (1) "Spider-man 2" had a plot.  Someone actually took the time to write a nice story to go with all of the on-screen action and special effects.  Additionally, it looks like the writers even took the time to research the original comic books on which their film is based.  Many plot points for "Spider-man 2" came right out of the first couple of years of Spidey's 'life' in Marvel Comics.         (2) "Spider-man 2" had characters you could actually relate to and care about.  From the misunderstood and confused Peter Parker to the morally-challenged yet still-sympathetic Doc Ock, all of the characters were fully realized people.  I think the audience could especially identify with the stresses and strains of 'young adult life' that Peter Parker went through.  (3) "Spider-man 2" didn't insult the audience by constantly pummeling them with explosions and special effects.  The action ebbed and flowed at a natural rate.  This made scenes like the one where the villianous Doc Ock explosively interrupts an otherwise tender moment between Peter Parker and the love of his life, Mary Jane, that much more dramatic.  I won't offer a spoiler here - you'll have to see the movie to see what I mean.  ...Great stuff!  (4) The effects of "Spider-man 2" - while incredible - never overshadowed the story.  Not unlike the brilliant films in "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy, the effects just sort of 'blended in'.  They were there merely to help to tell the story.  Now don't get me wrong.  ...I HAVE seen a few films that told a story brilliantly on a purely visual level.  But whether the story is told visually or by dialogue, you still have to tell a STORY!  Unless I'm seriously mistaken, that's the very essence of ANY sort of  dramatic presentation, isn't it?  (5) Last, but by no means least, "Spider-man 2" had a broad appeal.  You don't have to be an 8 year old boy to enjoy this film.  In fact, I know many women (who aren't usually known as Action Movie fans) who've seen and loved this film.  Y'know...guess what, Hollywood bigwigs?  If you want to make a movie that's going to bring in money by the barrelful, you'd be wise to make it appeal to as many people as possible!  Just makes sense, right?    So, in conclusion, I am happy to report that at least a FEW people out in 'La-La Land' are finally starting to get it.  Maybe the success of movies like "Spider-man 2" will help usher in a new era of QUALITY action films - films with a heart, soul, and even mind behind them.  If so, let us hope that such dumbed-down material as "Van Helsing" will soon be relegated to being just a bad memory.  Perhaps filmgoers of the near future will look back at this period and laugh at what USED to substitute for good entertainment 'back in the day'.  I don't know about you, but I've got MY fingers crossed!

      I had an epiphany this afternoon at approximately 2pm. It occured upstairs at the  urlLink James Prendergast Library  in the corner aisle bordering Washington & Fifth. The epiphany was as follows:   My unhappiness in life stems from not being myself.   I will contemplate this phrase until I recieve enlightenment. Or I will sell it to a fortune cookie manufacter. I haven't decided yet.  P.S. I'm not gay!

      Fear is a funny thing. The things that people can be afraid of don’t seem to have any limitations. As children we’re often afraid of imaginary things that our unlimited creativity seems to spout out without much effort. As adults, we are often more afraid of tangible or realistic things. Things like our kids getting sick, not being able to pay the bills or being rejected by the people we care about. If I give you a minute, I’ll bet you can come up with something you were afraid of when you were little and something you’re afraid of now. As you compare the two things you fear, they may seem to be very unrelated – but the emotional reaction is the same. Fear paralyzes you.  During his years as premier of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev denounced many of the policies and atrocities of Joseph Stalin. Once, as he censured Stalin in a public meeting, Khrushchev was interrupted by a shout from a heckler in the audience. "You were one of Stalin's colleagues. Why didn't you stop him?" "Who said that?" roared Khrushchev. An agonizing silence followed as nobody in the room dared move a muscle. Everyone was paralyzed with fear.  Then Khrushchev replied quietly, "Now you know why."   Although Khrushchev demonstrated the fear Stalin was able to exude over himself and the Soviet people, Stalin wasn’t free from fear himself.  It is said that the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin so feared for his safety that his residence in Moscow contained eight bedrooms. Each night Stalin chose a bedroom at random to ensure that no one knew exactly where he was sleeping.  Stalin feared for his safety and lost much sleep over ways to keep himself safe.  Khrushchev was afraid of what Stalin could do, until he was removed from power. Fear is something that we all have to face at some point in our lives. If you don’t take a moment to consider how you deal with your fear, you may find yourself frozen by its power to paralyze.  Jesus and his disciples spent a great deal of their time traveling about and ministering to the masses of people that were sick and hurting. It can be easy to assume that the disciples were always filled with peace and solitude because they spent so much time with Jesus. The disciples struggled with fear and discouragement regularly, even though they lived and worked with Jesus for about three years. Matthew 14:22-33, shows us how much the disciples needed Jesus’ help to live life without being paralyzed by fear.   Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone, but the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.   During the fourth watch of the night Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake.  When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. "It's a ghost," they said, and cried out in fear.   But Jesus immediately said to them: "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."   "Lord, if it's you," Peter replied, "tell me to come to you on the water."   "Come," he said.   Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, "Lord, save me!"   Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"   And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down.  Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."    The disciples felt like they were alone – possibly abandoned. Even though they were experienced fishermen, the rough water and wind frightened them.  Jesus knew where they were. Jesus went looking for them. He knew they would be scared. Jesus called out to them to comfort them.  The disciples thought Jesus was a ghost because they were so unsettled. Peter was upset, but he didn’t allow his fear to paralyze him. Peter got out of the boat, but when he saw the danger around him he panicked. Peter started to sink. He called for help.  Jesus immediately pulled him out of the water, climbed into the boat with the disciples, and the wind stopped.   The disciples worshiped Jesus after seeing his ability to care for them and protect them.  Jesus words and actions throughout this stormy night provided a great deal of comfort to his disciples. I think that these same words can provide us with the same comfort we all need when the concerns and worries of our lives are about to paralyze us.   During the fourth watch of the night Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake.   It can be hard to understand, but the fact remains that Jesus knows where we are and is looking for ways to get our attention. He understands the difficulties we’re facing more than we do. It is His desire to find us where we are, so he can take us to safety.   But Jesus immediately said to them: "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."   Jesus words were heard through the wind and the waves. Peter remembered enough about what Jesus had taught him to respond to his voice. Remembering God, holding on to courage and letting go of fear is the only way we are every going to get out of the boat.   "Come," he said.   Sometimes a fearful situation requires us to move out of our comfort zone. Just as Jesus called Peter out of the boat – he calls us out. If we keep moving toward God, we will move farther away from fear.   Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?" And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down.   To be honest, I don’t think that Jesus was surprised that Peter panicked once he left the safety of the boat. Jesus understands how frightening it is to step into situations that are unsure. That’s why he had his hand out waiting for Peter. Jesus didn’t wait to see if Peter could swim, he was ready and prepared to rescue him. I think that Jesus would have liked to see more faith in the reactions of the disciples, instead of asking them about their doubts. But just as he asked them why they had doubted, he calmed the winds. Jesus understands the need we all have for peace and clarity. Just like a child can’t learn their alphabet on a hungry stomach, we can’t accept that peace exists when there is a storm raging around or inside of us.  So what storm is raging in your life today? Fear, anxiety, and hurt can cause us to forget the peace and comfort Jesus offers just like the disciples did. We can begin to forget the sound of his voice, or just not be able to hear over the raging storm around us. So just as Peter called out into the storm, you can to. Don’t stay in a boat that’s being tossed about in the chaos of life. Come out and meet Jesus on the water. Although your faith may be small, he can calm the storm and take you to safety. Jesus can be your bridge over troubled water. Inside and out.

      I work at a church, although you would never guess it from spending time there. Oh, we can pull it together for some meetings on the Sabbath, but as anyone who has ever worked in a religious organization can tell you, Sunday is just a small part of the work. For a variety of reasons -- financial, clashing  personalities, differing expectations, the world, the flesh, and the devil -- the place has turned a source of stress for everyone involved. It may be listed in the phone book under church, but what we're building seems like anything but.  How do you measure a church's success? The number of people packing the pews? A lot of programs? A nice property? Money in the bank? I think an equally important rubrik should include the Christlikeness of the people who dwell therein. Taking a look at the scriptures I see some of the qualities that should be evident:  * love; joy; peace; patience; kindness; goodness; faithfulness; gentleness; self-control (Galatians 5:22) * tender mercy; kindness; humility; meekness; patience (Colossians 3:12-16) * true; noble; just; pure; lovely; of good report; virtuous; worthy of praise (Phillipians 4:8) * love that suffers long; is kind; does not envy; does not parade itself; does not get 'puffed up'; does not behave rudely; is not provoked; does not think evilly, nor rejoice in sin; rejoices in the truth; bears all things; believes all things; hopes all things; endures all things (1 Corinthians 13)  I don't know what we're all building, but using this criteria I can't say it's a church.  The other day I had an interesting experience. I had a coworker blow up at me. The ouburst was unprovoked, but what was interesting was what he said to me: among many other things, he said I wasn't a Christian. I remained silent so as not to escalate his anger, and refrained from giving him a lecture on the theology of salvation.  As I reflected on the days events that evening I really thought about what he said. I thought, "How judgemental. How misguided. How immature." But then I thought about it some more. Prayed about it. And I tried to see things from his point of view. What has my attitude been like these last few months? Confused... depressed... angry... impatient... easily provoked... divisive...  Darn. My coworker was absolutely right.  It's a baffling business. But I realize that it's not on Sunday mornings behind a pulpit that showcases my Christianity. It's my attitude and actions in the pressure cooker environment of the office in which my faith will be made real or not.

      The presence of vanity in people can vary in great degrees. Some individuals can’t pass a mirror without stealing a glance, but to be honest I’m not sure if that is the expression of vanity or insecurity in one’s appearance. Either way, the way we look is important to us.   The way I look is important to me. I once had a friend ask me if I ever had a dream about my teeth falling out. Oddly enough, I had recently dreamt about biting into an apple and having my teeth instantly crumble upon impact. I had woken up in the middle of the night terror stricken and feeling in my mouth to make sure the dream was not a reality.  Dreams about the loss of or crumbling of teeth apparently represents, according to my friend, the fear of losing good looks through age or other means. In short, dreams about decaying teeth equal vanity in the mind of the dreamer.   As a child, I remember looking into our shiny aluminum toaster and grinning ear to ear while devouring my Mom’s Avon lipstick samples. There was something unreal and fun about the color, taste and smell of the “Power Pink” and “Mostly Mauve” mini lipsticks. I still flash back to that childhood memory when I shop for lipstick and open the cap for the first time. I remember that my Mom would never go into the local grocery store without freshening up her lipstick. To this day, I check myself in the mirror before I go to the store. My Mom’s lipstick ritual showed me that it was important to look my best – even if I just stopping to pick up a gallon of milk. My Mom was very balanced though when I came to the use of cosmetics. On Sunday mornings, my Mom would put her makeup on while standing in the bathroom, her hair freshly curled and her dress newly pressed and waiting for her on a wire hanger. After carefully slipping her dress over her hairdo and shimmery white slip, she would take her wonderful red lipstick out of the drawer and carefully run the color over her lips. I used to complain to Mom when she would dutifully grab a piece of tissue and blot her lips, leaving a perfect lip print on the tissue square. She always looked so sassy with her powdered face and bright red lips. When I complained about her blotting habit, she would always say, “It’s just too much.” Looking her best consisted of freshly styled curls, a neatly pressed dress and blotted red lipstick. Leaving her lipstick unblotted would have just looked vain.   That really the point isn’t it? Caring about our appearance can become too much and we become a captive to vanity. The supremacy of Vanity is seen not only in the global arena, but in the local neighborhood as well. The look of your favorite actress is rather easily attained at your local salon, for the right price. The limits of perfection are no longer restrained to the silver screen. It is obvious in our culture today that the appearance of an individual holds more power than the value of the individual. I recently was drawn into reflection by a line in a popular film. “It’s not about who you are, in true LA style it’s about what you wear.” It’s this kind of focus on vanity and appearance that I feel is, “…Just too much”. The lines between Hollywood and home become close and blurred when vanity theology like this is accepted without considering the human cost of elevating appearance above the invisible internal value of each person.  Demanding media images have meshed with a personal drive for physical perfection, aligning men and women into demanding parallels of vanity. Often times, it seems that we all have forgotten that the people we aspire to replicate are two-dimensional, airbrushed images that are limited to the realm of make-believe. The lifestyles portrayed by the astoundingly beautiful people seem so perfect and seamless it becomes easy to forget that they are flesh and blood individuals. Make believe crashes with reality when we realize the extent of many individuals hard work necessary to build and maintain the machine of media images. There is a balance between make-believe and reality that is necessary to maintain in order that we don’t become consumed by unreal expectations and the emaciation of internal human character.   I do love to get my hair done; in fact it’s one of my favorite things to do. I’ll even bring photos of an actress sporting a new hairstyle in order to try and replicate it. But I know in my heart, I’m not going to actually become that two-dimensional picture perfect woman. Just like my Mom’s Sunday ritual, I have rituals that I follow every day before I go to work. I lie out my clothes, press them if they need it, shower, style my hair, get dressed, put in my contacts and put on my makeup. But not all of my rituals are physical ones. I pray, I exercise, I read, I feed my family and myself. If I spent all my morning fussing in front of the mirror I may look especially pretty on the outside, but my insides would become rather dark and dismayed. There would be… “just too much” on the outside but “not enough” on the inside. Before long everything about me would be off balance, and the three dimensional real me would become flat and cold. That would make me vain.  The difficult part of caring for yourself and others is that it is an art that requires a great deal of skill and practice to maintain. One of my favorite words is “Holistic”.   ho·lis·tic 1. Of or relating to holism. 2. a. Emphasizing the importance of the whole and the interdependence of its parts.     b. Concerned with wholes rather than analysis or separation into parts: holistic medicine; holistic ecology.  The word “holistic”, embraces a point of view that I feel is necessary for each person to live a truly healthy lifestyle.  It is impossible for a singular section of our lives, whether it be external or internal, to support the entire function of any person. It is in valuing each part of us and trying to help coordinate the overall function of the human body, mind and spirit where true “balance” is achieved.   In the midst of media images pressing the ideal of physical perfection into our everyday lives and the internal conflict we may feel to respond to that pressure, the use of grace and understanding is necessary in the pursuit of true wholeness. Concern for our appearance may not be something that we verbalize, but the internal conflict can pop up when we least expect it. Sometimes we have dreams that are teeth are crumbling. Sometimes we blot our lipstick. Sometimes we realize that figuring out what we really look like has nothing to do with peering critically into a mirror. Who we are isn’t limited to what we see, that is only one dimension of who we really are. Cultivating a holistic lifestyle is one that will take a lifetime to understand and understands that a lifetime is not enough to figure it all out. So, I will try to cultivate my mind by continuing to challenge it by learning something new everyday. I will continue to feed my spirit through prayer and worship. I will continue to play with my hair, because it’s fun for me. I will try to remember that the whole of me is made up of these equally important dimensions of self: mind, body and spirit, and I will treasure each one.  I will remember how my Mom showed me the importance of balance in life, but I will do something different than she did. I won’t blot my red lipstick. Showing a little sass now and then is something I need to make it through this journey. So I’ll say no to vanity, but yes to bright red sassy lips.

       Hello All! Here's this week's edition of "Reed's Rants & Raves". How's this for exclusive? - You're getting to read this before it even posts on the WORD's website. (Ooooooo!) Enjoy!      P.S. Remember to check out the WORD at  urlLink www.crword.com !      *****************************************************************************************************************      THE BEST TV SHOW YOU'VE *NEVER* SEEN    OK...so in all fairness I should probably title this column "The Best TV Show You've PROBABLY Never Seen". After all, it is just possible that a FEW of you may have caught "Firefly" in its original run on the FOX Network. It aired there for all of three whole months in the Fall of 2002.  In a nutshell, the history of the show is this: FOX approached "Buffy The Vampire Slayer" creator, Joss Whedon, and asked him to create a TV show for them. He delivered on his end of the deal, with what is without a doubt one of the best science fiction series ever made; but FOX apparently had no clue what to do with it once they had it! More about that later...  My introduction to "Firefly" came courtesy of my good friend, Ian Eastman. He kept telling me about the DVD boxed-set of the series he had picked up at Media Play. I told him that I actually had heard a little bit about the program when it first launched. - I AM a major 'sci-fi' fan after all. However, I was firmly convinced that this would turn out to be just one more in a long series of potential dissapointments for Yours Truly. Thus, I had avoided "Firefly" like the plague.  It's been tough being a 'sci-fi geek' these last several years - at least in MY humble opinion. You have to realize that I grew up in the era when science fiction was just beginning to capture the imagination of the general public. "Star Wars" came out when I was 13 years old. At that time, you could catch reruns of the original "Star Trek" on TV all the time - usually paired up with another of my personal favorites, the classic "Space: 1999". Anybody remember that one?  The television schedules of the time were rapidly filling up with content like "The Incredible Hulk", "Wonder Woman", "Battlestar Galactica", "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century", "The Lathe Of Heaven", etc. The legendary British sci-fi show, "Doctor Who", had begun to crop up on PBS stations around the U.S. Douglas Adams' "Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy" books were climbing the bestseller lists. Ah...it was a great time to be alive!  Now as I see it, somewhere between the early 80's and today, science fiction - particularly on television - fell on hard times. As a prime example...here there was a brand new "Star Trek" series on TV in the late 1980's ("Star Trek: The Next Generation"), and I SHOULD have been ecstatic. Alas, I soon discovered that - whereas Captain Kirk and his crew would 'boldly go where no man had gone before', Captain Picard and HIS group would basically spend a lot of time sitting around in conference rooms discussing technobabble - or they might occasionally hang out in their local watering hole, 'Ten Forward', and chat about the mysteries of the Universe with Whoopi Goldberg. Yuck!  Again...whereas the original "Twilight Zone" of the early 1960's had captivated millions with its eerie, otherworldly stories, the various recent remakes of the show (1985, 2002) somehow decided that shock value and cheap thrills were the only way to stir modern-day viewers. So long brilliant writing and intelligent plots!  And don't even get me started about all of the garbage that the Sci-Fi Channel produces! Bleahh!  So, I assure that it was with AMAZEMENT that I discovered something decidedly different by popping in a DVD of "Firefly"! (Thanks again to Ian for the loaner!) It became immediately apparent that someone had finally decided to go 'back to the basics' that had made the classic sci-fi shows of my youth so appealing. Without even realizing it, with all of these OTHER recent programs, I had been missing that great sense of wonder and excitement that the 'classic' shows had featured to such great effect. On an even more basic level, I was thrilled to see that "Firefly" had stories that actually made sense, fantastic special effects that never threatened to overwhelm the action or sustitute for good writing, and characters you could really enjoy watching on a regular basis.  Now I know I'm going to step on a lot of toes here, but in my mind, "Firefly" is a more logical successor to the original "Star Trek" than any of the latter-day series that followed it ("The Next Generation", "Voyager", et al). Like "Trek", "Firefly" features a crew of fascinating characters exploring THEIR version of the 'final frontier' - and running into all kinds of exciting adventures. Like the original "Trek", the show gives you a feeling for what it it would be like to be aboard a spaceship out there in the vast darkness of space. Again, "Firefly" also occasionally tells a 'morality tale' - without ever being preachy. - And, yet again, it features a lot of humor - most of it derived from the interplay of the nine vastly-different crewmates aboard the spaceship 'Serenity'.  Without giving away TOO much of the plot, the basis of "Firefly" is this (as printed on the back of the DVD box): "Five hundred years in the future, there is a whole new frontier, and the crew of the Firefly-class spaceship, 'Serenity', is eager to stake a claim on the action. They'll take any job, legal or illegal, to keep fuel in the tanks and food on the table. But things get a bit more complicated after they take on a passenger wanted by the new totalitarian Alliance regime. Now they find themselves on the run, desperate to steer clear of Alliance ships and the flesh-eating Reavers who live on the fringes of space." - Sounds like pretty good stuff, eh?  Now I've got to admit that a couple of 'red flags' appeared immediately upon my first viewing of this series. First of all, I was afraid that being a Joss Whedon - or "Buffy" - fan would be prerequisite to liking this show. Fortunately, I was quickly proved to be wrong on that point! - I have never seen a single episode of "Buffy The Vampire Slayer", yet I love "Firefly"!  Secondly, I initially found the shooting style of the show - lots of hand-held, 'trendy' stuff - to be distracting. (I'm very much a traditionalist, I guess.) This eventually turned out to be not a problem at all - and, in fact, actually ADDS to the show's unique feel.  Thirdly, I was a little concerned about the weird mixture of science fiction and Western that "Firefly" seemed to offer. Right from the opening credits - with its very Western-sounding theme song (and shots of stampeding herds of cattle, no less!) - you know that you're not in for the TYPICAL sci-fi thriller!  Finally, I was afraid that the crew of the Serenity would turn out to be one of the most cliched bunch of characters I had ever seen assembled together in one place. - After all, there IS the requisite "no-nonsense girl soldier", the "cocky, renegade captain", the "tough guy who only looks out for Number One", and, YES - even the "prostitute with the heart of gold"! Amazingly, though, Joss Whedon and his writers turned each of these people into completely new and refreshing creations! They are each so individually fascinating, that even after watching all 14 episodes, it's still hard for me to pick a favorite!  It's neat, too, that they decided to go with a cast of (primarily) unknowns for this series. With the possible exceptions of Ron Glass ("Barney Miller") and Adam Baldwin ("Full Metal Jacket"), most of the nine regulars are really not 'known quantities'. Nathan Fillion does a particularly excellent job portraying the captain of this ragtag crew. His Captain Mal Reynolds is at turns irritating, noble, self-centered, heroic, narcissistic, brilliant, callous, and caring. Also exceptional is Mr. Baldwin as the aforementioned 'tough guy', who has the unfortunate first name of 'Jayne'. He is absolutely hilarious as the boorish, self-centered, not-always-so-bright 'man of action' aboard the Serenity.  ALL of the characters of "Firefly" are very full-blooded, not-always-predictable, 'real' people. They're a refreshing change of pace from the 'one-dimensional' characters of the various recent "Star Trek" series. It's so much more interesting to see characters who are conflicted - who sometimes have trouble doing the right thing (or even knowing what the right thing IS!) - than to see the cardboard-cutout heroes of "The Next Generation" who never break a sweat and who always live by the WWKD? (What Would Kirk Do?) Code.  Now if I've turned you off to the idea of watching "Firefly" by emphasizing that it's a science fiction program - I apologize! Don't be mislead! This show's roots are very similar to those of the original 1966 "Star Trek" series. Back then, "Star Trek" creator Gene Rodenberry sold NBC on the concept of a "Wagon Train to the stars". I doubt very much that Joss Whedon used those same words some 35 years later to promote "Firefly" - but he very well COULD have!  It's amazing to see how the futuristic technology of the show is deemphasized in favor of presenting interesting stories and people you can relate to. Now that's not to say that the show is boring or slow. Far from it! The action is pretty intense in most of the episodes! There are a couple of shows that had me LITERALLY on the edge of my seat! This is a great series for the 'action' fan. And if you're turned off by the idea of weird alien races, don't sweat it. - There are none! In fact, the 'Reavers' mentioned above are actually humans who've gone mad out in the lonely blackness of space.  So, at this point, you MUST be asking yourself, "wow, if this show was so great, why didn't it stay on the air longer?" Well, blame it on FOX, I guess. Once they had greenlighted the project, they basically proceeded to immediately run the program into the ground. First by insisting that Joss Whedon create a NEW pilot for the series. FOX apparently didn't like the 2-hour telemovie he had intended to start the show off with. They wanted more action and less exposition. As a result, "Firefly" went on the air in September of 2002 with a good - if vastly inferior - episode. "The Train Job" - while a very action-packed and reasonably interesting episode - unfortunately had very little background to set up the series in viewers' minds.  To add insult to injury, FOX decided to run "Firefly" episodes out-of-sequence. For a series that has a very nice continuity built into its storylines, this is tantamount to a 'mercy killing'. As a finalt insult to those who had stuck with the series through its initial run, FOX decided to wrap things up by airing the original 2-hour pilot as the LAST episode. Perhaps their reasoning was as follows: Now that the viewers have made the committment to stay with us for several months, let's torture them further by showing them the pivotal episode that explains all of the various main character's true motivations - stuff that would have been helpful to know from the 'git-go'!  I can almost guarantee that at this point, you're probably wondering, "well, so what? The show's dead and gone, right?" Wrong you are, my friends. Since its release on DVD last December, the show has - amazingly - taken off! Sales for the complete "Firefly" series - which includes ALL of the produced episodes (several of which never even aired) in their intended order - have been brisk. Brisk enough, in fact, to inspire the making of a brand new theatrical release - due in April of 2005!  That's right! "Serenity" is currently in production at Universal Studios and the new movie will feature ALL of the original stars of the TV show. It seems that you just can't keep good programming down! It's exciting to see that "Firefly" has now found the audience it so richly deserves. If you don't believe me, take a look at some of the customer reviews being posted on amazon.com for the "Firefly" boxed set!  In conclusion, I urge you to run - don't walk - to your nearest retail video outlet. You need to pick up a copy of this great series. It'll only set you back like $30 or so - not a bad price for around 14 hours of quality entertainment! In fact, I'm SO certain that you'll love this program that I'm hereby offering a money-back guarantee. If you purchase the "Firefly" boxed set and - after watching it - decide that you didn't THOROUGHLY enjoy it, I'll personally refund every penny that you spent on reading this column! (Good thing the WORD's a free newspaper and website! Hee hee!)  Seriously though...check out this great show before the movie hits. That way you can impress your friends and family by saying, "yep, I remember when this thing was just a TV show." Oh yeah, and when you DO head down to the store...tell 'em James Reed sent ya'! (Not that it will do you any GOOD - but it will definitely make you sound very hip!)

       Hello all! Through an 'exclusive agreement' between Yours Truly and your Gizmonic Webmaster, I have arranged to post all of my column entries for The Chautauqua Region WORD here on The Experiment House blogsite. Of course, you're always welcome to head over to  urlLink www.crword.com  and check out the latest issue of The WORD - it's an excellent source for local news - especially in regards to what's going on in the Arts of Chautauqua County.      I am writing a weekly column entitled "Reed's Rants & Raves". The following article serves as an introduction to what I'll be writing about each week. Be sure to look for new articles here each week.       P.S. I welcome any and all feedback. I have set up a special e-mail account for that very purpose. Write me at  urlLink reedsrants@hotmail.com ! I look forward to hearing from you.      ****************************************************************************************************************     "NOW THE TRUTH CAN BE TOLD"  I am a geek.  You know...that actually felt sort of good.  What the hey? I think I'll say it again. I am a geek.  Yeah...I've got to admit that felt sort of cathartic. - Sort of my 'coming out', so to speak.  Yep, it's true. - I AM a geek. Now I know what you're saying to yourself. You're saying, "Hold the phone! Isn't this the same cool and happenin' dude we see each and every weeknight on Cable 8 News? James Reed - the legendary local weatherman who always looks so dapper in his 'clothing provided by Sears'? The SAME James Reed who is SO hip it's a wonder his bum doesn't fall off? How could HE possibly be considered a geek?!?"  ...What? ...You're NOT saying that to yourself? Oh.... Um.... Never mind.  Now let's set our parameters here. I want you to understand that when I say I'm a geek, I'm NOT saying that I meet the classic definition of 'geekiness'. For example: I do NOT wear eyeglasses with duct tape holding them together. I do NOT own - nor have I ever owned - a pocket protector for my pens. I do NOT sit around reading comic books all day. (Not that there's anything wrong with that!) I have NEVER had a problem attracting a plethora of beautiful and desirable members of the opposite sex. ...OK, maybe I'll have to concede that last point, but STILL!  No, my friends. My geekiness is - at least in MY opinion - limited to the fact that I am a complete and utter 'pop culture' and media geek. For as long as I can remember, I have been addicted to TV, movies, music, videos, video games, etc. I also enjoy a good book now and then - especially if it pertains to the subject of TV, movies, music, videos, video games, etc. Yes, sir...a complete and utter Pop Culture Junkie!  Compounding and confounding my unfortunate condition is the fact that my personal taste in things of this nature often goes against the grain of what is considered to be hip and cool at any given moment. Now personally, I think this is a GOOD thing. Especially since I am going to be (primarily) writing about pop culture and media for my friends here at the WORD.  I've got to point out that if there's anything I've ever noted as being common to the columnists I've PERSONALLY enjoyed reading, it's that they're (a) opinionated, (b) fearless, and (c) not always in sync with the popular thinking of the day. - Given those parameters, I'm thinking I should have a pretty bright future in this endeavor!  Let me assure you that I have some very strong opinions when it comes to entertainment. When it comes to TV, movies, music, and so forth - I know what I like. On the other hand, I really know what I DON'T like! Just ask my fiancée if you don't believe me. She's had to suffer through the 'seizures' I suffer whenever a particularly annoying song assaults my senses from across the radio waves!  So I think we've pretty much got the 'opinionated' part covered. As far as being fearless and nonconformist, I'll let you be the judge. After reading my introductory column here, you tell me if I'm not pretty darn fearless! And I don't think it will take you long to realize that I am not always in step with the popular opinion of the day!Let's talk details, shall we? Many of these (rather sordid) details will no doubt be fodder for future columns. At the very least, they will no doubt inspire some rather heated debate amongst my readers!  For example...when it comes to television viewing, I'd rather watch a DVD of a crusty old Black &amp; White episode of "The Avengers" (circa 1965) ANY DAY over your typical prime time network programming. One of my favorite channels on Time Warner Cable's new digital cable lineup (shameless plug!) is BBC America. I think one of the funniest people to ever grace the television screen was the legendary Benny Hill. I recently got downright giddy when I discovered that TV Land had a Sid & Marty Krofft marathon scheduled in their lineup. (You DO remember "H.R. Pufnstuf", right? "Land of the Lost"? "ElectraWoman &amp; DynaGirl"? Classic stuff!)  Movies? Again, I go against the grain! I'm quite possibly the only person in the U.S. who thinks that the best cinematic James Bond was Timothy Dalton (circa the late 1980's). Despite THAT little factoid, my favorite Bond movie of all time is 1969's "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" - starring the virtually unknown George Lazenby as 007! - Go figure.  I'd rather watch the 1966 "Batman" movie - starring that paragon of strength and virtue, Adam West - than any of the misbegotten output of Tim Burton or Joel Schumaker in more recent years "Holy Bat-Guano, Batman!"  I also have a fondness for truly schlocky films of the horror or sci-fi variety. I just got done watching the lovely Melanie Griffith in a film she no doubt would like to expunge from her resume. Anyone ever seen the brilliant social commentary, "Cherry 2000"?  AND, let's face it, I may well be the only heterosexual male of my generation who actually loves the 1980 'roller-disco meets 40's swing-dancing' musical, "Xanadu". (And please understand that I mean no disrespect to anyone by that statement!)  As to the music scene, my tastes are widely varied. I can honestly say that I love all kinds of musical styles. ...Yes, even Opera and Country (to some SMALL extent). Shoot, I even like Disco!  As to what I listen to on a regular basis, well...lately the four albums by alt-rock group, Cake, have been circulating in and out of my CD player on a rotating basis. My favorite rock group of all-time is the widely-misunderstood Genesis - in all of its various permutations. And when it comes to romantic or 'mood' music, I have to confess to worshipping at the altar of the ever-suave Roxy Music front man Bryan Ferry. (Yeah, I know...most of you are saying, "WHO?!?")  If all of the above doesn't scare you off, consider this... besides my beloved Genesis, I happen to think that two of the most misunderstood and unjustly-despised music acts to come out of the 1970's are Electric Light Orchestra and Captain & Tennille. Don't EVEN get me started about Nick Gilder! (OK, sorry...that one might be a little TOO obscure!)  Anyways, before you turn away in total disgust (and before my fiancée disavows any knowledge of me), let me say that I'm not COMPLETELY 'out there'. I have been known to 'jam out' to such musical artists as Eminem, Jay-Z, Outkast, and Nelly. I can often be spotted watching such relatively normal shows as The Simpsons, America's Funniest Home Videos, and Spongebob Squarepants. (Oops...I did said 'normal', didn't I?!?) I have even occasionally been spied coming out of a theater where a major blockbuster was being shown. - In fact, I just saw "Spider-Man 2" and LOVED IT!  So consider this week's column as fair warning. Yours Truly is a complete and utter 'pop culture geek'. With that in mind, I've got a whole bunch of things to throw your way. I'll be bringing you reviews of new movies, music, and television. I'll be recommending some 'alternative media options' you may not have previously considered - including, of course, some of the whacked-out things I PERSONALLY enjoy watching or listening to.  I may even go more in-depth in trying to figure out just how it is I ended up this way! - In fact, I anticipate a column soon entitled, "Blame It On The Bat". - Adam West, you have a LOT to answer for!  So, welcome to the wonderful, weird, and wacky world of "Reed's Rants &amp; Raves". Strap on your seatbelts, folks. It's likely to be a bumpy ride!
