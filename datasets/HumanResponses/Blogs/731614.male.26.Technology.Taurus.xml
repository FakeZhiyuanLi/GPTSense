Reese's Pieces.   2.  are you happy with your life right now? what would you change, if anything?  i'm happier than i thought i could be, but i still want to be earning better money and playing more Dr. Mario.   3.  do you think you are the smartest member of the bloghouse?  no... wait... yeah, no.     4.  what is your biggest guilty pleasure?  i have so many, but it has to be a tie between power ballads and Star Trek.  somebody help me.    5.  do you tend to be aware of your surroundings?  in other words, if i were standing behind you with a cream pie right now, would you be able to duck before i hit you with it?  i claim to be very aware, though my glazed-over gaze suggests otherwise.

      Ok so the smart ones know that there are only 49 states because we can see through the propaganda of the modern world. To the ones who are not smart enough to realize this, let me be the first to tell you, IOWA DOES NOT EXIST!!!!  It is  a fabricated lie made up by 2nd grade teachers across the US to make us feel stupid. Well they didn't get me, but I am smart.  There are not many people out there that can name 3 cities in Iowa, and it is true that only the aliens visit the place.  I think that maybe it is the headquarters for scientology, but I can not talk about that because they will knock on my door if I do.   So when goose tells me tonight, that he lives in Iowa, please excuse me or being scared of goose.

      But Belle is really a monkey they are doing research on at a zoo.  Haven't you all ever found it strange her neighbor is a panda, and she is always surrounded by goldfish, and the only stars she talks about are the ones that are all dried up and have nothing to do with their time but go to the zoo and moan to the monkeys about their washed up life?. HHMMM.  The research is proving to be a success, for she can form sentences and type and log on and off the internet.  Soon the world will be overrun by the cloned monkey population and we can all say we knew the first one.

      Boz has a bastard child who is none other than porn star Tommy Byron...  The reason Boz complains about being snowed in during winter is because he spends his days and nights listening to what he's misread to be 'masturbation tapes' but what in reality are ' meditation  tapes'... thus, in a constant state of confusion he curses at the soothing voices instructing him to relax while he waits for his queued climax.

      Contrary to popular belief Hard is really an 80 year old german woman living in a small grasshut in eastern Kentucky.  Also known as "das purpurrote eichhörnchen" he/she/it has been known to menace trailer parks while leaping naked from tree to tree.  In recent months das purpurrote eichhörnchen, scourge of the trailer park trash, has been sighted gingerly plucking the feather's from pigeon's bottoms and using them to fashion the soon to be patented "pigeon butt feather exosuit."  The details of this suit are still unknown but it is said to revolutionize human life as we know it.  In closing the naked DPE, bane of the TPT, is creating the PBFE to save humanity.

      is on the verge of becoming magnificently famous on the internet, but the skeletons in his closet could make or break him.  let me tease you with these questions. for example, how did he get the name Gooseneck?  it's a more sordid tale than we could ever imagine.  and, just imagine for a moment, if you will, the great triad of Goose, Ernie Banks, and Crazy Larry.  just think of the evil they could perpetrate.  oh, and i heard he likes to wear women's underwear.  on his head.  while sitting on the exercise bike.  and we all know what else he does on the exercise bike.

      Apologized!  This is big news.  I WAS RIGHT ABOUT HIM!  Well of course, he did something pretty dumb, and he did offend a bunch of people and will  probably still have death threats for a long time, but I saw some good in him, and dammit I was right.  I am still pissed off he didn't think I was good enough to copy but hey, that is not a battle I am ready to fight. Major good call for him for coming clean and apologizing, at least I respect him a bit more for it.  I hope this doesn't get me kicked out of the house.  But I feel there is not enough controversy here.    And why is it all the good posts happen in the comments here.  Maybe we should start posting blank posts.  Will someone tape smallville for me tonight? or at least watch it and tell me about it at 10:00?

      Ok, the haiiku thing was a big success, so it's time for a new assignment, and why am I the one always dishing out the assignments? Anyway here it is. Do a self portrait of yourself. You can either draw it freehand and scan it, or use one of the various Paint or Photoshop programs, or any other way you can think of. Then send it to me at boz48730@hotmail.com and I will make a photo page of some sort where we can check out our blogmates in all their splendor. Ability isn't important, but participation is.  I will post the portraits as they come in, but the deadline will be Wednesday 10PM EST, 9PM CST, 8PM MST, 7PM PST, and Thursday 8AM in the Philippines.

      this is getting bad.  ridiculous, even.  i promise everyone i will clean my closet today.  now that the promise is out there, i will feel pressure to follow through.  every square inch of my closet is occupied, horizontally and vertically.  and since this bigass blog compound undoubtably has walk-in closets, that's a lot of junk.  maybe i'll have a yard sale.  it's all gotta go.  the closet must be renovated.    i mean, i have to make room for Mike.  and that's not because, being a peeper, he wants to drill a hole through my closet wall to look at the other women.  he's not that kind of peeper.  i think.    ::surveys clutter:: where did i get all these free samples of sprayable canned cheese?  anyone want this hockey stick?  this is gonna take a while.

      For some reason, I'm drawn back here on a Friday night. I think Dvl had something to do with it. Friday. It used to mean something 'ya know? Used to be: Friday was for carousing. Friday was for lettin' off steam. Friday was the glorious day when the whole weekend was laid out before us like a summer vacation...  Not anymore.  Now Friday is for waiting... At least it is for me. Waiting for Monday. When I can go back to work. WORK?!?! Are you fucking kidding me? How psycho am I?   Work is the one place where I feel like I'm accomplishing something... Oddly enough. It seems like at least one of the aspects of your life is always going... O.K.   Let's have a party! Right here! I'm suckin' down an MGD as we speak! Join me!

      I guess since the house is in my name I should give the first assignment. And it is ... Write a haiku about the person in the list below you. (5-7-5) Dvl, being the last on the list will write one about the person on the top of the list, meaning me. Ok, you have till 7:00PM EST tomorrow to finish your assignment. That would be +5 GMT.  Post it in the confessional

I flirt with all the boys and, lately, pretty much all of the girls, too. so watch out.  either that, or this will be my first and last post...cuz i'm also a little flakey (okay, maybe a  lot , but who asked you?) but can i just say: i freaking love blogger for making this so easy! i just get to log in once and choose a blog. you're going to be sorry...cuz my motto is: if it's easy i do it (also if he/she is easy i do him/her...) whatever. bring me some vanilla cappucino. and if my husband calls--  i'm not here!!

You know the ones we underprivileged kids would only get to watch when the Disney channel was trying to coax more people to subscribe to their station? They would broadcast their shows on basic cable for a week once every six months.... just long enough to get kids hooked on their shows. Then those same children would drive their parents insane by begging and pleading until they caved and ordered the damn channel just to stop all the whimpering and complaining.    It never worked with my parents. You'd think they had iron will or something.

      The bottle of liquor pictured in the previous campsite pic, by the way, was a concoction called "Cinnamon Jug" - Half full of apple cider and half full of whisky, with a few of those big cinnamon balls dissolved in the brew.  Great on a cold day.  YaYa could make a mean sandwich, look at this one -    All kinds of stuff in there, but nothing gay.  YaYa eventually went to Ames, Iowa to get his degree in solid state physics. Never heard from him again.

      This post attempts to debunk house speculations on the nature of my relationship with YaYa Daouda in the Alaska days.   1.   While YaYa's name sounds quite gay indeed, he was a foreigner from Camaroon, Africa.  It was his given name, it was not a gay pet name.   2.   The "Anchorage gay-bar" incident has been referred to vaguely. Here are the facts - When YaYa and I arrived in Anchorage, we went into a bar that we were not aware was a gay bar.  The bartender kept giving me free beer, so I was happy to stay.   Then when I went to the bathroom, I noticed all the gay literature that was posted (my name was  not  posted there, contrary to house speculation).  I told YaYa, "Hey, we should go.  This is a gay bar". Which freaked him out a bit.  Apparently they don't have them in Camaroon. A few weeks later, I called a cab to go to a job interview and YaYa became concerned - commenting, "You must be careful.  It may be gay taxicab".   3.   Documentation -     This is in Valdez - No indication of gay body language at all.     Campsite - I'm sitting by a girl, not by YaYa. And I'm looking at the jug of liquor, not at YaYa.  I hope this ends any speculation.

         Look at the new plant I bought today.  It's called a Dracena Surculosa, or a Florida Beauty.  Coincidence? I think not. The care tag says that it should be in indirect light, with moderately moist soil, in a warm home.  Let's see if I can manage to keep this one alive. Or will it go to plant heaven where my other plants go in winter? Only time will tell.  And if you look close enough, you'll see that that is our wonderous zonk board, working.  This way when it's down, at least we'll have photo proof that it does work on occasion.  Fill fill fill. Sometimes using left align is a pain.

      I owe Boz a public apology for my tequila induced outburst of anger last night concerning the censorship of the monkey tattoo picture I had posted.   I was way out of line to go on my little bitch spree, and frankly, I feel pretty stupid about it this morning. I'm sorry Boz. I understand that essentially, this is your gig, and you were nice enough to let me in. I had no right to come in and tip the scales like I feel like I did last night. I sincerely hope that we can put this behind us, because I do enjoy the madness that this house generates.   I maybe need to do some soul searching and determine if this is a good fit for me. I have enough trouble keeping my own blog rolling at times... I'm sure some of you can relate.   Boz, you have the ultimate say if you want me out or not.  Technically, I did quit last night, so I virtually hung my own neck. If you asked me too, I certainly would leave. But please, for the record, I would like to stay. I feel that this is something special, and I would really like to continue to be a part of it.   In the future, no matter what happens, I will watch my words, and not lash out in fits of anger at anybody. It was unfair and extremely juvenile. I am hanging my head in shame and I am sorry. Please accept this most humble apology.

      1.  Marci is last seen climbing the walls to escape from the cameras and roomies.  Over the roar of the ocean all we can make out from her shouts is something about "bootie" and "Brazil," or was that "cooties" and "Godzilla"?  2.  The mystery is solved.  Jonnie is not Goose.  Goose is not Jonnie.  And they are not having a secret love affair.  And by "not" I mean "TOTALLY MEETING IN BACK ALLEYS TO SHARE THEIR MAN LOVE".  3.  DVL shines the bright light in Belle's face demanding to know the truth and it is revealed that Belle is indeed not a Phone Sex Operator, but what is this about... a friend in Vermont?  4.  Boz is revealed to indeed be Bill Murray.  Or Brian-Doyle Murray.  Or Anne Murray.  Or was it Anne Frank?  Well he does write in a  diary , and the resemblance, well, you've probably noticed, it's uncanny.   5.  Brown is the new Black.  Amish is the new Gay.  There are a lot of Amish Bars in Anchorage, and it wouldn't be uncommon for you to find Jonnie's phone number amongst the Amish literature in the Amish Bar bathroom he frequented with his "special friend" YaYa.    6.  Boz has to leave the Hot Tub due to concerns that Jonnie is going to give him the "bad touch".   7.  Jonnie beats Belle at Hot Tub Wrestling, which is just like Mud Wrestling, except there is no mud and it's in a hot tub and Jonnie really loses but tells Belle to tell everyone he won so he can try to keep his "tough guy" (ha, ha, I bet even YaYa is laughing at that one) reputation.      Quote of the night was provided by Jonnie, and I swear, you just can't make this stuff up, you really can't:  "How did this happen?  I just thought I'd drop by the hot tub...had a little wine...and now I'm gay."

      1. Hi. 2. Sorry I've been so lax in posting lately. 3. I have no memory of my teachers. 4. dvl is, quite possibly - The Coolest. 5. Where can I get a cheap web-cam? 6. I heard a new word today: Sneakretive. It's a cross between sneaky and secretive. Feel free to start using it in your own daily life. 7. Here's a word I'm trying to bring back: Cinchy. 8. Blog Madness is driving me crazy. But... That doesn't mean you shouldn't vote. 9. I put up a cool post on my site. But nobody's coming by... 10. My ex's mother has started reading my site. AND she works for the government! GASP! 11. AND THIS IS A BIG ONE! What if we put up Paypal buttons on this site and all of our personal websites to raise money for a face to face meeting of The Real World? It would have to be a central location for all of us... I dunno... Just a thought. What do you guys think? 12. I love my fish. They are cool. But my new Kribensis is very sneakretive. 13. I love both Photobucket AND Belle. 14. I am to blame for nothing. 15. LA and OC members: Would you guys wanna come see my show?  16. I miss you Marci. Even though you have not accepted your panties. 17. Miller High Life is truly The Champagne of Beers.

      There is a common English word that is nine letters long. Each time you remove a letter from it, it still remains an English word - from nine letters right down to a single letter. What is the original word, and what are the words that it becomes after removing one letter at a time?   NO CHEATING! don't look it up on the web and then post the answer, because that's lame.

       Kindergarten -Ms. Pero: told me she'd write my Y's up and down my arm if I didn't learn to stop doing them backwards  1st grade -Ms. Jackson and Ms. Weatherly: Don't remember anything special about them, but the water from the sink tasted the best in their class.  2nd grade -Ms. Lang: Wouldn't let kids go to the bathroom. Derek Kelley threw up on her. Taught us about Helen Keller, which was cool.  3rd grade -Mrs. McClellan: She was very annoying.. Thought she could rule the world. She was wrong.  4th grade -Ms. Metz: The woman to which I owe my mathematical skills. Always had some sort of fun project up her sleeve (such as selling popcorn to kids on the playground outside our classroom window)  5th grade -Ms. Watters: Had the most perfect handwriting in the world.. she could write in a perfectly straight line on the chalk board, with no lines to follow!  6th grade -This is unfair, because in FL by the time we get to this grade, it's considered middle school and we have a different teacher for each subject.  Grades 1st-5th I spent in the "mini-school" which was one building, opened on the inside. So there were no walls dividing the classes. Organized chaos. It was great.

      Kindergarten - Mrs. Harris, hated her cause she made me drink milk and I puked. 1st Grade - Miss Andrews, wanted to marry her. 2nd Grade - Mrs. Martin, nice lady but Miss Andrews started the year as my 2nd Grade teacher but left to get married, or so they said, so Mrs. Martin paled in comparison 3rd Grade - Mrs. McKinnon - One of my all time favorite teachers, she was gruff and could be mean, but Kenny was her favorite, so there you go. 4th Grade - Mr. Conti - Catered to the girls, turned out he tried to date them too. 5th Grade - Mrs Haitinger, nice lady, a couple of levels below Mrs. McKinnon, but still a nice motherly type. 6th Grade - Mrs. Wallace, almost as cool as Mrs. McKinnon, but a lot younger, and she had the whole geek girl with glasses thing, and didn't mind flashing her cleavage when she bent over to give you a hand with an assignment.

      Back in my undergrad, I had to take a world history class and this was back when I drank too much and spent time doing nothing over studying (not much unlike now).  I figured I had not missed a class and I listened pretty decently so I did not even open the book before the exam.  I flew through the exam feeling pretty good about it until the last question read, "explain the impact Racin had on Macedonia".  Well I had never heard of Racin, and didn't even have a clue as to what area of culture this question came from, so I wrote a 3 page essay on how the leisure time in Macedonia was spent on a track with the horses and buggies, with bets of land being placed on horses who were named Phillip I, Phillip II, and Phillip III.    Turns out this was not the right answer (right answer being: he was a man who was founder of modern Macedonian literature) and when I got the test back I had gotten -15 for not knowing, BUT the prof. gave me +10 for creativity.  Goes to show, if you don't know something, it really doesn't hurt to make it up.

      Today I was working with a four month old Maltese named Dru. For those of you who don't know your dog breeds, a Maltese is a little white furball that fully grown, you could still carry in one hand. Needless to say, Dru was considerably smaller. Unfortunately, this was Dru's first time in my establishment.  My left hand looks like I stuck it in a blender.  Dru became an unholy whirlwind of claws and teeth. Ouch.  I must love animals. I didn't strangle her or anything...

      While Boz declares his undying love and devotion to  Kevynn Malone  Goldie Hawn.     Is it March yet?  Is it, is it?  Because February makes me want to pack up all my glow worms and head for greener, sunnier, Martin Sheenier pastures.   Also, should I be concerned that I have a growing addiction to  urlLink Degrassi ?  I tried to tell myself I was just waiting for  urlLink Daria  to come on, but 5 episodes later it was safe to assume Daria was not coming on and I was  still  watching.  Well it could be worse, I suppose.  Wait, no, no it couldn't.  Help me, please.

      I can not tell you how much i love marci monday.  I am all worried i am going to type things right for the first time ever and disappoint my fans.   Random story time:  One time i first started dating a boy i went to his house and it was the first time i had met all his friends.  Well i immediately starting feeling eird so i went into the bathroom and put h2o on my face and though i was better walked to the door grabbed the knob and then i ws sittingon he floor looking up at my hand.  So more h2o, and i felt better.  I walked out to the party and all the sudden i hear tons of laugter and there are people standing over me.  Turns out i had passed out. and i was all embarressed that his friends were ass's for laughing at me.  But it turns out when i hit the floor someone yelled "oh god she just realized she is dating paul".    Moral of the story: if you pass out meeting his friends run like hell. There is a year i will never get back.  (now youall can see how my posts look before i spell check and post, i really don't think it is that bad)

      Hi guys! I hate to say this... But I think it's for the best if I move out of The House. I just don't seem to have the time anymore. I can scarcely keep my own site updated, much less have the added guilt of ignoring this one.  You guys are the BEST. Period. I'll be lurking around the Hot Tub periodically, if I'm welcome. Boz, thanks for the great experiment!  Love 'ya, Mike Martin (The Hard Artist)

      Roses have bloomed by the pool!    I've named the pink one on the left "Belle" And the two red ones on the right are "Sandra1" and "Sandra2".  And...Dang, I hate to exclude anybody. I think I've started something that might be difficult to finish.  I guess "Boz" is the hose, "Dvl" is the diving board.  And...umm...the light there in the rose bed?  That's "Hard Artist" because it's metal and therefore hard.  Off camera, there are 2 inflatable water wings floating around - "Zann" and "Mike".  There's a snorkle that will hereby be known as "Zoot".  When I look in the water, I call my reflection "Marci" since she's my doppleganger.  Damn...what else is there?  I've bit off more than I could chew.  Well, there's an empty beer bottle that I'll have to name "Gooseneck" since there's no tequila.  And "The Bored Housewife" is what I shall call the barbecue grill (but not out loud in front of the house owners).  And "Jonnie" is, of course, me. I need to go buy beer.

      However, i have not yet been able to get into the groove of posting here... had you noticed?? it's like... i say everything i need to say (and thensome!) on my own site, so when i think about posting here... well, i got nothin' left.  damn. what's my problem?? i guess if i can ramble on incessantly there, i ought to be able to do it here. i mean, what's the point of living here if i'm not even going to stink up the place with garlic and post-gym-feet?? I'm certainly not here for the free beer--cuz there never is any. and i don't venture to think i'd be here for the peace and quiet, cuz you guys are all more trouble than 6 sets of mini-tornado twins.... i guess that just leaves the skankiness of the hot tub sessions... but i haven't been in on one of those in a while so i almost forgot. anyway, what's my friggin point?  oh yeah, as usual i don't have one. well graaaaaaaand.  i loved everyone's refelction pictures! and of course i thought of a great one today. day late and a dollar short? how's about a week past due and a zero shy of the target? that's me.  i hope you all had a fabulous monday. remind me to post again soon--this was fun. well, it was slightly better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick, at least.

      In order to understand educational corruption you need to realize that everything is controlled by a following made up of people who think Steven Tyler is sexy with help from Zoot and Zann.  The conspiracy first started during a rock concert in an undisclosed location (we could tell you but we'd have to kill you.). They have been responsible for many events throughout history, including Marilyn Monroe's skirt incident.  Today, members of the conspiracy are everywhere. They can be identified by squealing and panting pledges of undying devotion.  They want to beat the Rolling Stones and imprison resisters in boz's septic tank using little blue boats.  In order to prepare for this, we all must pass a law. Since the media is controlled by Christian music we should get our information from Aerosmith.

Today, members of the conspiracy are everywhere. They can be identified by the picking of the nose and eating it.

      It would be funny for housemembers to record audio files for other housemembers to use as their answering machine messages.  I initially wanted Sandra to record one for me because it would be rad to have an answering machine message in German, but she is not currently microphone equipped.  So it would be on a strictly voluntary basis. It could be like a christmas gift exchange with voluntary participation.  Whoever gets Belle would win because her voice is cute. Whoever gets me would lose because I will sound retarded.

           BLOGMATES GRAB YOUR DIGITAL CAMERAS because we've got a new weekly RWBS challenge!!     (Note: you can use either a digital camera, your webcam, your mobile phone camera, or you can scan in a pic taken in 35mm film)  The game will be played like I Spy --  every Friday a hint/topic to photograph will be revealed, and each blogmate will be required to post a photo in response on the following Monday (giving us the weekend to complete the task), and the result of which will be a photo essay of our collective efforts.  The 'assignments' will be broad enough in nature to accommodate all types of digital cameras (i.e., you can take the pics inside/outside with a digital camera or camera phone, or you can take the pics at home with your webcam).  [For example, one hint/topic could be to take pics of something of a specific color like  RED  -- you could take and post a picture of red flowers, a pic of you in your favorite red shirt, a pic of someone with red hair, or even a pic of red lipstick stains on a napkin.]  The topics will be randomly chosen (and by 'random' I mean that each week a new letter of the name of our blog will be used to create a topic), and  the first assignment will be posted this  Friday  .

      Today, today was not a good day.  I was convinced all the forces of evil were working against me to crush my spirit and make me hate every person on this planet and maybe a few people on other planets, too, especially after the whole "Do you subscribe to the idea that ignorance is bliss?" repeat incident at the dentist and the race I got into with a 16 year old when all I wanted was to go to the goddamn store to buy some more Twizzlers!   But.  Then something wonderful happened.  My mailman, who I'm sure is just really busy and that's why he just left a package on my doorstep instead of ringing the bell, and not because he's afraid of me after I confessed I wanted to have his mail babies, brought me something wonderful.   A monkey.   A monkey from Michigan.   A monkey who answers to the name "Zob," a gift from the wonderful wizard of Boz.          And suddenly my day is all sunshiny and I feel like I do when it's Wednesday and there's a new episode of The West Wing on and Martin Sheen invites me to his house to watch it with him.   Yeah, it's a crappy picture from my webcam that couldn't begin to do this monkey justice, but until Jonnie sells his kidneys to buy me a digital camera, this is the best I can do.

      One time in college, while I lived on the 4th floor, a friend came over to hang out and generally I would throw my keys out the window for him to catch to let himself in.  Well I was feeling a bit nazi this day, and wanted him to earn the keys.  This meant he had to catch a potato chip in his mouth before i would throw the keys down.  Apparently it is hard to see where you are going when you are running with your mouth open facing straight up, and he ended up running into the brick wall with his teeth.  He never made it up to my room because he had to rush to the dentist so fix his 2 front teeth that he had chipped in half.  I guess he really didn't want to hang out with me.  The End.

      I searched deep within my soul for a way to express how enriched my life has become since I  made parole  was invited to join The Real World Blogger Style, and I think Whitney sang it best, only not really, which is why I made a few slight changes.  I'm sure Whitney won't mind, especially since she's a crack whore, and in my experience crack whores don't start many fights over the changing of lyrics to express any warm fuzziness one might feel towards their roommates.  That's just my experience though.  If she calls?  I'm out of the country, adopting a baby in Guam with my husband Roberto.  Thanks.      I believe the  Real World Blogger Style roomies  are our future  Teach them well and let them lead the way  Show them all the   urlLink Tootie   they possess inside  Give them a sense of pride to make it easier Let the  roomies'  laughter remind us how we used to be  Everybody searching for a  monkey   People need someone to look up to  I never found anyone to  refill my meds   A lonely place to be  So I learned to depend on  Boz    Chorus:  I decided long ago, never to  blog  in anyone's shadows  If I fail, if I succeed  At least I  blog  as I believe  No matter what they take from me  They can't take away my  insanity   Because the greatest love of all  Is happening to me  I found the greatest love of all  Inside  the hot tub  The greatest love of all  Is easy to achieve  Learning  what a Posture Bar is   It is the greatest love of all   I believe the  roomies  are our future Teach them well and let them lead the way  Show them all the  nougaty goodness  they possess inside  Give them a sense of pride to make it easier  Let the  roomies'  laughter remind us how we used to be   Chorus  And if by chance, that special place  That you've been dreaming of  Leads you to a  mental institution   Find your strength in  zonk

That it's possible for me to add one more thing to my life to feel guilty about (infrequent posting). Thanks, Boz.  That there are more quizzes floating around the internet than should be allowed by law.   That the house is always empty when I'm around. Coincidence?  That, although we may never meet. I'm better for living here and knowing you. This place has helped me through a pretty tough time.   Marci... You're giving up a good thing here. But isn't that always the way?

Don't kick me out I am back.  How My Life Is Enriched By You All: I have never been dumped on the internet before by someone I don't even know. THANKS A LOT HARD.  I would have to meet up with the one other absent posted.  I knew I should have gone for jonnie.  I have learned how incredibly bad my spelling is, and often welcome the comments about it.  And I also think it is cool I can get drunk in the hot tub and make an ass of myself and you all treat me like that is normal.    The only way i could be more happy here is if you threw in a few midgets and some elephants. I love you guys... hey, thanks to who ever is feeding free beer.

      I've been enriched. Ever since I moved into this looney bin my life has become enriched on so many levels.   I am proud to be a part of this little thing that we got going on here... It is extremely unique in so many ways.   And you guys... my blogmates... are just freaking awesome. Though I am still ignored by most of y'all on the zonker, I feel that I have made several new friends here that I never would have made if not given the opportunity to be here.   I have never met any of you in person, but yet I feel kind of like I know some of you really well... and what you are about. When it comes down to it, we are all about mostly the same things. It usually tinkers on the edge of the strange and bizzare, but I like it that way. We are sharing this strange and bizzare world together.    We are all complete strangers and yet we are all good friends. That in itself has enriched my life.  Whatever it is that we got here is special.   It is working.   It is becoming bigger than life and the envy of the blogosphere.   Thanks to you guys for letting me come on this journey with you. As twisted and strange as it may get in here, it is indeed our Real World. We live it, We love it, and we blog it. And nobody does it better.

      Let me count the ways... no, seriously--if you'd shut up for a sec, maybe i could focus. damn you people are noisy. ahem.  1. I love drinking in the hot tub, and making out with anyone and everyone who's in there (including the pets..) 2. I have learned how to pee with the door closed....well, sometimes. 3. I have added another log to the "too distracted to be productive" fire, which was only burning at bonfire level before 4. I have formed deep and meaningful friendships with other campers which will last a lifetime. (well, if you count make out sessions as deep friendships..) 5. I love every minute i've spent in this house...has it been 20 or 22? 6. um, that's it. i just wanted to add another number....  also, i bet none of you are driving to Boise idaho singing along to iron maiden and metallica while surfing the web right now. so there. i guess i deserve an award or something. cuz i'm either a complete nerd or a complete metal head or a complete hick...and that's too many people to fit in one body.....

      Without digressing into the merits of blogging in general, I think the RWBS possesses numerous additional life enriching characteristics that place it firmly in a class of its own.  Unlike most organizations, the housemates are not necessarily like-minded individuals and where they might ignore one individual’s blog, the mandatory participation insures blah blah blah blah….  HAHAHAHA!!!  I was just talking shit.  I only joined to meet Belle.  Joining the house has been much like accidentally falling into a swimming pool fully clothed at a public event.  Initially embarrassing, and your money’s no good.  But also somewhat invigorating and often refreshing, depending on the weather.   The RWBS has enriched my life far more than a job ever could.

      The Real World Blogger Style (RWBS) has improved my life negligibly over the past two months.  i have developed close-knit relationships with other bloggers in a window of an entirely different color than the windows in which i had been communicating with them previously.  i have experienced the wonder of a virtual hot tub.  my friends have been referred to as a "following" (i've never had one of those before!) and now they live here, too.  being against the evils of institutions such as sororities and sports teams, i have needed to satisfy my need to belong in other ways.  the camaraderie of RWBS has filled that void.  i have learned so much about essential life topics:  monkeys, super heroes, webcam scandals, Doc Martens, toasters, sex, BlogMadness, the shaving cream head game, and fake crazy people.  you just can't get that anywhere else.  i have been so very happy here that my mind has collapsed into a rubbly pile of writers' blocks, causing me to neglect posting valid content on this AND my personal blog, which has really freed up my time.  and, this one time, i got to write a haiku.  i have grown as a person, and it's all because of RWBS.  thank you.  the end.  zann out.

      Being a member of the RW... blogger style has enriched my  sensuality . I hear sweet twitter but there are no birds around. I smell monkeys but there is no zoo. I see sombreros but there is no friggin Mexican. Well, in fact there were no major changes to my senses of taste and touch, but that maybe because I'm only here for some 5 days or so.

      so, i was hiding under Belle's bed this morning, and i overheard the strangest thing. she was on the phone, but i don't know who she was talking to. she kept mentioning "the squeeze" and something about a garbage bag full of 20's. i was a little freaked out, but turned on... so finally she finished the call and then she was humming a strange tune. something from the rocky horror picture show, i think... anyway, at the first opportunity, i made like Jesus (and got the flock out of there). and when i ran into her in the bathroom a few minutes later it was a little awkward. ...and not just because i was in the middle of peeing when she walked in. we chatted about the weather, but she could tell i was spooked, since i didn't make any lewd comments. she had a look in her eye, not unlike suspicion. she couldn't have known i was listening to her shady conversation, but i'm a little worried anyway.  so if Belle asks anyone what happened to the stash of porn she had squirrelled away under her bed... don't tell her it was me!

      while surfing the net last night, and here are the results that I came up with for the members of the house.   What is your sexual preference?   1. Marci - 22 year old Brazilian midgets. 2. Zann - Plushies and over age rock stars. 3. Hard Artist - Exhibitionism, well, duh!!! 4. Belle - The Monica Lewinsky syndrome. 5. Dvl - Spank me Daddy, I've been a naughty girl. 6. Mike - Josie and the Pussycats meets the gang from Scooby Doo. 7. Goose - Barnyard animals. I think that explains how he got the nickname. 8. Jonnie - Dark skinned gentlemen from Cameroon. 9. Zoot -  Sax sex. 10. Bored Housewife - I'm sorry Bobby, I can't find my purse so I guess I'm going to have to find another way to pay you for mowing the lawn. 11. Sandra - Mistress, your next appointment is here.  My computer crashed and I lost the link before I was able to find out about me. Funny how that stuff works out, isn't it.

And I'm:         You're  Great Expectations !   by Charles Dickens     Coming from humble beginnings, you have become pretty stuck-up in your later years. While hard work and dedication were the path you first walked on, a sudden fork brought you glory and fortune. Unfortunately, you have changed even more than your bottom line. You really should turn back to your old friends and at least respect your old life. Look out for haughty hotties.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .

      i swear, i didn't cheat or otherwise influence this quiz to mark me as my all-time favorite book.  it's just that clever... Deep Thought must have programmed it.        You're  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy !   by Douglas Adams     Considered by many to be one of the funniest people around, you are quite an entertainer. You've also traveled to the far reaches of what you deem possible, often confused and unsure of yourself. Life continues to jostle you around like a marble, but it's shown you so much of the world that you don't care. Wacky adventures continue to lie ahead. Your favorite number is 42.

            You're  Watership Down !   by Richard Adams     Though many think of you as a bit young, even childish, you're actually incredibly deep and complex. You show people the need to rethink their assumptions, and confront them on everything from how they think to where they  build their houses. You might be one of the greatest people of all time. You'd be recognized as such if you weren't always talking about talking rabbits.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .

      As I tend to see myself in the tradition of the early 20th century Dadaism-artists, my intention is to negate all common aesthetical and social values with the following haiku:  Black Bettie Death Cult La La La La La La La Black Bettie Death Cult  I know that - apart from the number of syllables - this has about NOTHING to do with a traditional haiku, but I aimed to shock.  I'm a rebel at heart.

She can post her haiku, and send me her self portrait and I will post that.  Oh yeah, for extra credit she can drink the blood of a virgin.

      After  weeks of hiding in the bushes in front of your house ( I have 2 stalking-charges going on now, are you satisfied?!) and watching you from afar, Boz has finally decided to show a little compassion and let me in. YAY!   Though I'm not quite sure yet if Boz let me in because he likes me or because he couldn't stand Jonnie's begging any more... . But now that I got a foot in the door, you won't get rid of me easily... mwahaha!  So, what shall I say... I'm german, currently living in Hamburg, 25 years old and well, check my blog, there's a little about me-section too. Feel free to make jokes about all my spelling- and grammar-mistakes and also feel free to ask me everything you ever wanted to know about Sauerkraut.  What else? I got a diploma in economics and a job in marketing but as this isn't satisfying at all, I'm currently busy establishing a cult with me as the deified leader.   That's basically it. So will somebody show me where the bathroom is? I brought my special toothbrush, just in case I'll get a little homesick.      (mwahaha, let's see how long it takes untill they realize that I infiltrated this house for disciple-recruiting and brainwashing purposes only... MWAHAHA... ooops, did I just say that loud?!?!)

      Since i'm a little past due for posting something anyway...  okay, here's something i've been afraid to mention, but i just have to get it out there... um... i'm pretty sure this place is haunted. i mean, sometimes, when i'm dressing for bed, my bedroom door will just swing open, and there's no one there. or when i'm in the shower, i'll feel a breeze, and a chill passes over me. and i  always  feel like i'm being watched. no matter where i go in the house, someone's eyes are following me, but when i look around, there's no one there. one time i opened a bottle of beer and then there was a knock at the door, and when i came back--the bottle was empty. and just yesterday i was in the attic, putting away the last of my suitcases (which are finally all empty) and there were strange whisperings and shadows, some heavy breathing, a giggle.  so is it just me or do we have a poltergeist lurking????

      Ok, so I never could think of a signature phrase, but as part of my rehab my sponsor told me I need to "make amends" so I came up with slogans for everyone!  Ok, fine, I'm not in rehab, and when I say sponsor I mean monkey, and maybe I had a little  urlLink help  with the slogans, but still.  It's the thought that counts, isn't it?   Isn't it?   At least that's what my parents told me every Christmas when they gave me rubber bands and boxes of Shake 'n Bake (pre-Cat Shake 'n Bake Incident) as gifts.  But enough about me.    1.  Please Don't Squeeze The  Boz .   2.  The Best Part Of Waking Up Is  Marci  In Your Cup. 3.  I Liked The  Zann  So Much, I Bought The Company! 4.  Break Me Off a Piece of That  Dvl .   5.

Madmathias . It's Everywhere You Wanna Be. 10. The  AtlSuperstar  That Eats Like A Meal.   And in conclusion, I would like to say there is no conclusion, except I think my eyes are bleeding and if I never see another slogan again it will be too soon.

      The guy pouring my beer 2 weeks ago broke my liter glass.... I think it is would only be nice to leave Drew as a temp pict for me until I can get a good authentic picture of me and my new mug for my icon.  It seems only right to me, ......and should to you all too.  In other news.... I would like to apologize for my absence, but ever since Mad has moved in, my time has been spent ... um, elsewhere.

      Some weeks ago, I decided that I'd love to have baby animals around me and since I have neither time nor enough room for a little puppy or a kitten, I thought that it would be best to have some fish babies. So, in order to get the fishes in the mood for some sweet lovin', I lit two candles in front of the fishtank and played The Temptations' "On The Nightshift" on heavy rotation. And here's the result of that effort:     Yay! Two babies (one hides behind the plant)! They are about a week old now, fishes "David" and "Bowie" are the parents. Thing is, I don't have names for the offspring yet. So I decided to name the fishes after the  first two people who comment on this post . So go ahead! This is an unique chance to become the namesake of something that looks like mutant sperm!

      At the advice of my inner conscience, I have decided to move out of the RWBS house. I really cant commit the time it takes, and it wouldn't be fair or feel right for me to keep hanging on.   I have enjoyed my time spent here, reading about your lives and getting to know you. I will continue to read your individual blogs and visit here often to keep up with your crazy shenanigans.   Meanwhile, I plan to keep Gooseneck up and running and would love to have you guys stop by once in awhile.   Thanks for everything and for putting up with me all this time. I wish you all the best .   Goose

      Ok Boz, I get the sense that you did not quite believe me when I said that I got all of the answers right to the quiz (Except the John Lennon question, mind you, you say Bridgette Bardot and I say Natalie Wood), anyway... to try to prove to you that I wasnt just saying that I thought that I would elaborate on a few of the questions that were a little bit harder.  Boz said that Bridgette Bardot was the subject of the Beatles song Norwegian Wood. That may be a rumor (there are several) but the one I heard was that it was written about Natalie Wood whom he met on a chance encounter while in Oslo Norway in late 1964.  Don Larsen of the  New York Yankees  pitched a perfect game in game 5 of the  1956 World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers .  I had the quote "we dont need no stinkin badges" as coming from the movie   Magnificent 7   Roger McGuinn's full real name was  James Joseph Mcguinn .  I didn't elaborate as much as Boz did on Dino's death, I merely had  Plane crash air guard   And admittedly, I had  the Monkees  down as the author of the Grand Ennui and not specifically Mike Nesmith.  I actually did a term paper on  Pete Gray  while I was in junior high school (that's middle school for you youngsters). I knew that he only had one arm.  I knew that Ronnie Reagan was the first president to live after being elected in a year that eneded with zero because I remember being disappointed that he broke the chain. (I know, it's harsh, but it is true.) Also, another cool fact about Ronald Wilson Reagan... The letters in each of his names has 6 letters. Thus, 666.  Most answers were relatively easy to find on the internet and the few that I didn't know I was able to get from  urlLink Hawspipe  quite quickly. Not only do I use him as my attorney, I also go to him with my tough questions.  So... Perhaps my comment about having all correct answers was a little overblown, but I did have them right according to my sources. And really now... Do you think that I would actualy lie to you?  Ha! Take that Boz!

      You've probably noticed that Goose hasn't been around for awhile. Turns out he hadn't ditched the house like all of you had suspected, it seems that in real life he has just moved into a new house and has been very busy. Also, Goose claims that he got every one of the answers to the trivia quiz correct, but that was easy to claim once the answers had been posted. Finally, in dvl's  Thursday Three , which dvl didn't actually write, Goose said the one activity that he was forced to participate in was school picture day. Here is what he had to say about it:   My parents thought that the school photo was the most important thing in the world. I hated it and one time about 7th grade didn't smile. My mother freaked OUT. She set up an appointment and made me re-do it and this time she went with me. She was so pissed and to this day I cant figure that out.   When I told him that would be a good pic to post he claimed that it had been lost forever years ago.  But !!!  I did a Google Image search and was able to come up with the  urlLink original pic , the  urlLink replacement pic , and three other pics of Goose taking part in  urlLink various   urlLink school   urlLink activities . Take that Goose!

      Is anyone interested in the house celebreating Christmas in June with a gift exchange and other holiday stuff? I haven't thought it out yet, but if enough of us were interested it would be a cool thing. Participation would  NOT  be mandatory, so don't worry about that, just the people interested. Names would be drawn at random and there would be a spending limit of I guess ten dollars, but if that is too high we could make it five.  Give me your feedback on this people.  Let's make this  Christmas in June  the best  Christmas in June  we've ever had!!!

      Some of us were hanging out last night. and we all scurried over to check out Mad's buzznet. and there was much joy. he should be made aware that several lewd comments were made, most of which came from Boz, but still. if i were him, i would be flattered. ...although we all know it doesn't exactly take much to get me smiling. he may very well be the most elligible bachelor in the house or the least eligible most bachelor...or something. and for some reason i saw pictures of someone else a while back and i thought it was him... so i thought i knew what he looked like, but i was wrong. ...unless he lost a lot of weight and had a new smile surgically implanted and dyed his hair and bought color contacts....? so that was kind of funny for me--a pleasant surprise. almost as funny as this one person who kept commenting on my buzznet stuff... i assumed it was a guy. read the blog, there was a story about a girl, romantic, etc. said blogger signed things with a name that is 99% of the time a men's name. then said blogger posted self-portraits on buzznet. girl. hot girl, even. so it was a win, win situation. but odd, nonetheless.  also, if anyone has a spare roll of duct tape, could i borrow it? oh--pool boy's here, gotta go---  (and no, i'm not doing this to distract attention from the Jordan fiasco.)

      I've decided that there are some things in my past I need to atone for.  Since I won't be able to apologize to anyone for them, I'll make amends by fasting one day for every one on my list.  Anyone ever fasted before?  Any tips?    I wonder if this will factor positively in my goal to let the past go.

      if you are going to a fast food restaurant and ask for a "plain cheeseburger" what do you intend to receive?  A) a burger with a bun and a slice of cheese and nothing else,  or  B) a burger with everything imagineable EXCEPT cheese.  i more often than not get the morons in the drivethrough who think it is B (or some undefined C), which is precisely the opposite of what i want.  i want A, dammit, and is that too much to ask?  i'm only swinging through these damn drivethroughs now and then cuz my current work hours lead to much time in between meals.  woe is me.

      It must be boz' tremendous authority that makes me feel like I HAVE to apologize for my lax posting in the last week... so here we go:  I'm sorry.  So so sorry. I'll do the dishes of all housemates for the next week.   My official excuse is that my mom visited me for a few days. It was awesome... though she forced me to listen to the "Dirty Dancing" soundtrack all the time and to watch films with Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts. But then again she invited me to a fancy restaurant where I not only had the best fillet steak in my whole life, but I also sat at a table where the Bee Gees and Englebert Humperdink used to sit  as well. Woah. You know, my butt was in contact with the chair that used to be in contact with Englebert Humperdinks/ the Gibb brothers' butt(s)... so my butt virtually rubbed the celebrities' butts. Jealous, huh? Well, I was THAT excited that I performed Sir Mix-A-Lot's "Baby Got Back" on our way home on the subway, but let's not get into details.  So, here I am after all and I promise not to neglect the RWBS again, but in the unlikely case that I do so, I'll watch Meg Ryan movies as a punishment. That's just fair.

       And you hear the DJ say the words "Creek Nation in the house" take my advice:  find the nearest exit and run like hell screaming into the night.  Because life is about to get a hell of a lot more complicated.  To tell you any more, I'd have to see your CDIB card.  At any rate, I just spent a lovely and low-key evening - wait, make that no-key evening - with my uncle, his girlfriend, and my very first ever real true love and his basically common law wife (also known as the mother of his child).    I loved this boy like mad from the time I was 13 until I was 23.  I don't know if he ever loved me like that, but at a few points in our lives, simultaneously in fact, during nights that were too short, I think we felt "something" in our quivering mid-sections and recognized its existence between heavy breaths and fumbling tongues.  He may have loved me like that.  I think I saw it tonight.  In the 15 years my family has known him, he has come to be one of us, yet earlier my little age-thirteen heart still jumped when he looked at me and my mid-section quivered with an anxiety that will never quite be quelled.   I don't suppose my love for him ever really grew up, and honestly, I hope it never matures.

      Please allow me this moment of self-indulgence -     What's immediately apparent is the pink rose (Belle) is gone! Probably plucked, unless the coyotes got it.  The red roses (Sandra) have blossomed into Sandra #s 1, 2, 3...probably at least a dozen.  The hose (Boz) has been shot-off all over the place - at least once.  The diving board (Dvl) - still bouncing, nobody's hurt themselves on her yet.  The barbecue grill (Bored Housewife) - still cookin'.  My reflection in the pool (Marci) is still there when I look for her, she appears drunk.  Neither the beer bottle (Goose) nor the snorkle (Zoot) are anywhere to be found.  I was going to uninstall the light fixture since Hard Artist left...but the house owners weren't willing to indulge me on that.  I thought the waterwings (Zann and Mike) had left as well, but found them bundled up in a petstore bag next to a toy chair -     There's a new orange rose on the left which I originally pegged as Mad Mathius; but keeping with my analogy, it would be a remanifestation of Belle and Mad Mathius would be stepping into Hard Artist's spot as the night light.  I'm assuming nobody wants to be the big bag of garden fertilizer.  That will be all.  How I can be so insanely busy and still manage to waste, not just my own, but everybody's time it beyond me.

      I would like to clear up this misconception about me and Tommy Page.  Remember how everyone thought Jonnie was obsessed with Zann?  And it turned out to be completely true?  Yeah, this isn't like that.  I mean, it was purely a coincidence that I happened to be standing outside the lovely Hampton Beach Casino when Tommy stepped off his tour bus.     Also, please note that I am not one of the acid-wash jean clad girls in the following picture, and not because I'm afraid of heights, and not because I was already in his room hiding in the bathtub, but because I do not love Tommy in such a way that would necessitate climbing in his window to ask him to sign my shoe.         Anything else you might hear is a complete fabrication.  Especially if Tommy tells you himself and he mentions a stuffed bunny and a restraining order.

      I just submitted RW and a bunch of individual blogs to the Internet Archive for crawling and saving.  This is an ambitious project (with mixed results) to archive the whole freaking web at various points in time...it's like mega terrabytes of data and it's all well protected and regularly migrated as well as copied and kept in different countries around the world.  So in a thousand years or so, when researchers are looking at how people used to practice the Cincinnati Steamer at the dawn of the 21st century, Belle will get proper credit for practically inventing it.  And Boz will be rightfully worshipped as a God. And I will go down in history as the first Amish blogger.

       Hasselhoff claims he had hand in Berlin Wall falling    "David Hasselhoff has complained to museum curators after finding his photo absent in a collection of memorabilia about the fall of the Berlin Wall."     "He said he felt he had moved people on both sides of the wall, although he admitted hardly any of the East Germans could speak English. He said: "I find it a bit sad that there is no photo of me hanging on the walls in the Berlin Museum at Check-Point Charlie."  "'After my appearance I hacked away at pieces of the wall that had the black, red and yellow colours of the German flag on it. I kept the big piece for myself and gave the smaller pieces to colleagues at Baywatch.'"   "Hasselhoff said he doesn't mind that Americans make fun of his popularity in Germany and says he feels it is his second homeland."    urlLink Full Article Here

       (aka. Thursday 3)    1.  Past, present or future... what is the best Christmas gift ever?  2.  What’s something done by strangers that annoys you beyond belief?  3.  You already have socks on your feet, and you now realize that you only have the following two choices for footwear: Tevas -or- Birkenstocks.  What do you do?    (As in weeks prior, a super silly amount of thanks, admiration and other such validation goes out to Andrew at  NineMileDetour  for writing two of the three questions this week... visit him and give him love (or call him on his shit, whichever you like).  Sharing is caring, people.  Also, thanks to BenBen for the other question -- who, if/when he sees this i suspect will exclaim “OMG! OMG!” and mutter something about a time machine and gorgonzola cheese.)

      Since I was unable to post last Friday, here is the belated question for last week:  Name your 5 favorite television characters of all time (no animals or cartoons).  I also wanted to say that I am very distraught at the loss of our lone pure redhead.  I guess she must have discovered my dirty little secret.  mike, thanks for the good times in the hot tub.  quick x-mas in june list:  * unique pez dispenser(s) * supply of fun dip * all flavors of big league chew * invader zim wristband * water balloons

      Blogger is still acting up and is randomly changing back and forth between the old and new template.  As you have probably noticed zann and mike have left the blog. They both contributed a lot to the blog and it's sad to see them go, but as they both said it was time for them to move on.   urlLink Monique  kindly offered to fill in on the xmas in june gift exchange, but as I said in the previous post it was easier to straighten out than I thought it would be. Thanks Monique your offer was greatly appreciated, and please continue to lurk as much as you want, who knows you may be the next person to see Jonnie's  little pony  as he saunters down the hall half asleep and buck naked on his way to the shower.  For now eight looks like a good number and I think we should hold off on any new members until after Xmas ... in June.  Anything on anyone else's mind?

      as some of you may have read on my page, i've been experiencing some technical difficulties with my current living situation.  it seems i have some catching up to do here at the rwbs, so let's begin.    You're a Speak & Spell!!  You nerd, you.  Just because you were disguised as a toy doesn't mean you weren't educational, you sneaky bastard.    urlLink   What childhood toy from the 80s are you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       You are Francesca Fiore! You have no problem getting what you want, where you want it, and when you want it. Sometimes you get a little sidetracked by your sexy sidekick Bruno, but there is no mix that you cannot get out of. You are sexy, you are beautiful, you are glowing, you are Francesca-enough said! You have starred in many movies, even if their content is somewhat questionable and has been censored all too often, and you have a love of all furry creatures, especially if they can make a good handbag.     urlLink   Which Kids in the Hall Character Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       You are a Fucking Idiot.  You're all about screwing people over.  Your celebrity icon is Heidi Fleiss.    urlLink   What Kind Of Idiot Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla        Also known widely as the Fire Bird, the phoenix is a profound symbol of life and rebirth. It has a life cycle of 500 to 600 years and after that amount of time, it sets itself on fire and dies in the flames. Then, after three days, it rises again from the ashes. It is a completely benign creature who lives in dew. It is said that the phoenix has a beautiful melodious song which grows ever more mournful as its life comes to an end. It is also a symbol of the sun and immortality.   What mythical beast best represents you? urlLink Take the quiz!    the end result seems to be i am francesca fiore's reborn sarcastic, nerdy, and fucking idiotic side, which happenss to resmeble a cross between heidi fleiss and a speak and spell.  a speak and fleiss if you will.  also, happy birthday sandra, and welcome back lisa.  my set of wacky wall walkers has gone missing.  has anybody seen them?

      Wait, I am Gavin!!!    You are Gavin! If your head were made of veal, which you know it is not, but if it were made of veal, how much would it be worth? $20? No, you don't think you'll sell. You are a bit clueless as to what is really going on around you, in fact, you seriously annoy everyone you come in contact with. Although, this does not seem to phase you in the least. As long as you've got your glasses and your backpack and your mom is away getting her makeover done, you're happy, and are content to ask useless questions and give useless answers until the cows come...which they do, every Thursday, right after they lunch with the President.    urlLink   Which Kids in the Hall Character Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

A formidable creature half lion and half eagle, the griffin is said to be one thousand times stronger than any lion and five thousand times as farsighted as an eagle. Humans find themselves unable to lie while in a Griffin's presence. The griffin is also said to be fierce and untamed. It was a protector against evil and people often wore talismans of a griffin's claw to protect them from demons. Griffins were often used as transport for the gods. They were also reputed to swoop down from the mountains on occasion and pick up goats and small horses and bring them back to their nests for their young.

      Just when I thought today was totally in the shitter, I get a link to Craigslist where a co-worker has penned the following personal ad:  "You will offend me by doing something which annoys me. I will throw pickles at your head. You will cry. I will laugh at you. We will embrace, dive onto the futon and make hot monkey love. I will promise never to throw pickles at you again. You will apologize for annoying me. I will burp. Loudly. You will wake up in my muscular arms. We will drink coffee and coo at each other. You will do something trivial which annoys me. I will throw extra-crispy French fries at your heaving bosom. You will cry. I will tell you that these French fries are trans-fat free. This will reassure you. We will dive onto the futon and make hot monkey love. I will eat the French fries."   (Thanks to D, for the pick-me-up that I so greatly needed)

      I have always wanted to start my own cult so people could freely worship me, give me money, and to help me avoid paying taxes.... but as normal with all of my good ideas, someone beat me to it. Here are the commandments of the perfect cult, brought to you by the geniuses over at the  urlLink beer church.   1.  "Thou shalt have no other gods before me."  This means that it is okay to like wine, or whiskey, or what have you, but you must love Beer above all others.  2.  "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image."  Remember those hats that were vaguely popular back in the 70’s? The hats that were made of macramé and old beer cans? Don’t do that.  3.  "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain."  No beer bashing. Never say things like, "fuck beer" or "beer sucks." Also, try to refrain from dissin’ on beers that you yourself would not chose to drink. For instance, you may not like Hamms, but that does not mean it sucks. It simply means that you don’t like it. Someone else does. All beers have their place. Just because it’s place is not in your fridge, that doesn’t mean you should call it names. That creates bad beer karma. An example: Upon first tasting a premium American lager, a famous English humorist once said, "Put it back in the horse!"  Not long after that, while adventuring in New Guinea, he found himself stripped naked, lathered in honey, tied to a pole and fed to vicious hordes of fire ants for the amusement of a native tribe. Fire ants go for the "soft" tissue first. Ouch.  4.  "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy."  There are two reasons why you should not work on Sunday: Hangovers and the NFL.   5.  "Honour thy father and thy mother:"   I grew up around Seattle. That means my Dad had to choose between being a Rainier man, or a Oly man. My Dad was a Rainier man. I respect that. My Mom sometimes adds a couple pinches of salt to a glass of draught beer. She doesn’t really have a reason, she just likes it that way. That’s cool. And if your parents don’t drink beer, it's okay to pity them as long as you honor them by having a cold one in their name!  6.  "Thou shalt not kill."  Do not waste beer. We all joke about "party fouls," but truthfully we should morn the loss of a perfectly good beer.  7.  "Thou shalt not commit adultery."   In short, this means that you should never aspire to be President. That station in life will open you up to far too much scrutiny. No job in the world is tougher to do, and no job will expose you to such high levels of stress. It therefore follows that no job will make you want a beer more than being President. Also, since beer is easier to obtain when you are a person of such significant power, it is a bizarre twist of fate that being President so seriously hampers your ability to drink freely. Something as simple as drinking a beer in the Oval Office will likely cause a hyper-political media backlash and you will be forced to apologize to a nation of ungrateful people who likely would have done the exact same thing given the opportunity.  8.  "Thou shalt not steal."   This one is pretty obvious. Don’t steal someone else’s beer. Always share the last bit in the pitcher evenly. When splitting a 6 pack with someone, don’t drink extra fast just so you can have 4 beers. Respect your fellow human being’s appreciation of beer.  9.  "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour."   This means that you should always invite, or at least advise, your neighbors when you have a party.   10.  "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, nor anything that is thy neighbour's."  There is no reason to be jealous of, or to harbor ill will for your neighbor just because he has beer. You can have beer too. Every grocery store and every convenience store has got beer for sale to the public, and you are free to go there and get some beer of your own. However, if your neighbor has got a stainless steel Snap-On Beer Fridge and a urinal in his carpeted garage, nobody will blame you for being jealous.

       Birthday in may ,  xmas in june … can it get any better?! YES!  America in july ! (and august… and september…)  So I bought plane tickets today and now I’m officially scared to death! Anybody got tips against the fear of flying? Well, apart from drugs? And no, don’t tell me that I should relax because there are more people killed by donkeys annually than are killed in plane crashes. (dunno if that’s true, I doubt it but well, I just read it… and now I’m afraid of donkeys too).  Well, since this is my first visit to the states ever, I did a little research on the internet and gathered some facts about america and its inhabitants. That’s what I found out:  - About a third of all Americans flush the toilet while they're still sitting on it.  - Most American car horns honk in the key of F.  - There are more plastic flamingos in America than real ones.  - One of every 11 boxes of cereal sold in the U.S. is Cheerios.  - 36% of Americans say that God has spoken to them.   That’s all I need to know, huh? Or anything else?

      a quick poll to see if anyone would be interested if i suggested ideas for a favorite friday list.  we have the thursday 3, picture monday, and the occasional scavenger hunt.  just thought i would try to bring something other than alcohol and lame humor to the table.

       (aka. Thursday 3)    1.  If you got an all-expense-paid week vacation anywhere in the world, where would you go?  2.  When was the last time you were in a fight?  What caused it?  Who won?  3.  Are you comfortable enough to urinate in front of another person?

      at least for the  RWBS .  Dvl, MadMathias, and Nancy  will be meeting for drinks and debauchery at an undisclosed location somewhere in the wilds of Southern California. This will be the first face to face meeting of any house members. Paramedics and CHIPS have been alerted.  Also,  Monique , a trusted friend of the  RWBS  will be in attendance.  Sorry  belle , but your out of body experiences do not qualify as actual meetings.

      I think it is important for us, as blogmates, to perform regular public service. And I have found an appropriate project.  According to  urlLink a news article,  in the Houston Chronicle, textbooks recently approved for use in the state of Texas "are being criticized for being so focused on abstinence that they fail to include state-mandated information on contraception....For example, Holt, Rinehart and Winston's 'Lifetime Health' lists 10 steps for students to protect themselves from sexually transmitted diseases. The use of latex condoms is not one of them. Students are advised, however, to get plenty of rest."  Now, as adults (Jonnie excluded, of course), we are ALL aware of the importance of getting plenty of rest when it comes to preventing STDs. But we know it is so much more than just that. So, as our public service project, I propose that we add to this list of ways to prevent STDs.  I shall start.  1. Get plenty of rest (thanks, Holt, Rinehart and Winston) 2. Avoid using the same knife to cut both poultry and fresh vegetables. 3. Remember to turn your car wheels toward the curb when parking on a hill. 4.

      and i don't know how to spell the next one, so that's all you get... However, it is time for me to bid you all adieu. I have been a reclusive, non-participating member of this house for far too long. I have not posted in more weeks than i can count (hey, i'm not good with math, okay?) Nor have I taken quizzes or photos which would have included me in the house happenings somewhat... AND I couldn't even manage to get Jonnie's present in the mail before Christmas Eve--and we all know mail doesn't get delivered on X-mas, so he probably doesn't even have it yet... In short: I suck (and while, granted, i DO swallow, that just doesn't count for what it used to).  Anyway, it's been fun, and i love you all (possibly in that creepy, obsessive way that is prominent in stalkers and death row inmantes...).  I will continue to lurk, so watch out... I am blowing kisses toward all of you at this moment-- Lisa

      Ok so i folded under pressure and I opened my gift, but in my defense it was not my fault since the Jonnie included some device that talked to me every time I walked by.  It siad "Hey Marci I need to be opened right now" so it is Jonnie's fault. I will hold off putting pictures of me playing with all my goodies, but I just want to say that he did a good job.  He even has my back on certain pregnancy concearns, or maybe he is just smart enough to know that it would be very bad if I was to ever have a kid, either way I love Christmas in June.    Maybe we should do Kwanza in August.  That might be fun.  Also, I want to expand on the name of car question.  I have a friend that named her genitalia and I found that nuts, is this normal practice?

Well, the german tradition is to open the boxes on the 24th, so it's perfectly legitimate if I open mine today, right, right, RIGHT?!?! Damn, I'm so curious!  I mean, dvl got my name, so the gifts just have to be purrrfect.  And awww, Jonnie's singing got me in such a festive mood, I had to decorate my computer:     I'm excited.

      Dvl is organizing a video chat to celebrate xmas in june, you need not have a webcam to participate.  Everyone is encouraged to do an audiopost of their favorite  xmas in june carol , though I doubt anyone could top Jonnie in sheer chutzpah  So far belle, dvl, marci and lisa have received their presents, and as expected both belle and lisa have already opened theirs. Leave a comment if you have received yours.  Also, Nancy has suggested to rosa that being the two newest house members that they might exchange  xmas in early july  presents. I don't know how that is progressing.  That's all I've got.

      After I read your post I walked my happy a** to the office and without explaining my case looking all around the office and i said: "Who in here goes by the name of Matthews!!!!" Well,the one lonely woman in there, looked a bit scared since I was talking to empty closets and couches.  She had the look that I am so used to getting, you know the one that screams  "HOLY SH*T THIS GIRL IS CRAZY, I better not make any sudden movements".   She said her name was Matthews, but she generally goes by Latrice.  So I said "Suuuuurrrrrre you do, and I bet now you are going to tell me you don't steal Christmas gifts, right LATRICE MATTHEWS".  I even threw in the best roll of crazy eyes I could do but it turned out a bit more Zoolander than I would have liked.  She was confused since, you know, it is June, and pointed to a pile of gifts on the floor.  Turns out that Mattews/Latrice was stealing gifts from EVERYONE in my apartment complex.  I snatched up my gift and looked at her with "warning eyes", the kind that put the fear of god in her.  I think this is definitely the last time she will try to steal my presents.   So moral of the story, I got my gift... I will wait for Christmas to open it though.  If i can, self control has never been my strong suit.  Now excuse me... I have to write a letter to put on all 100 apartments about the evil that is happening in the front office.

      We have two new members.  urlLink Rosa Posa  who has already arrived and  urlLink Nancy  who just needs to reply to her invitation.   Belle  has already received her xmas in june package and claims that she hasn't opened it yet. Of course she works in a hospital so she has probably x-rayed it, c-scanned it, mri-d it and ultra sounded it.   Marci  has yet to receive her present that was sent by UPS two weeks ago. Hopefully that will be straightened out, but just in case I have submitted marci's name to  Toys For Tots , because no grad student should wake up to an empty xmas in june tree on xmas in june morning.  Big doings in the  Hot Tub  last night.  Jonnie, Belle, Marci  and her friend  Melanie ,  dvl , and our special guess hot tubber  MadMands  all showed up, and NO we didn't talk about you, well ok, yeah we probably did, but what happens in the tub, stays in the tub. So suck it. Oh yeah,  Jonnie  wanted me to apologize for him and to tell  Mands  that he is sorry about that one incident last night and he fully intends to replace the panties that he chewed on.  That's it.

      we accept a couple of new members after the xmas in june gift exchange. It sounds like a good idea to me. Bueller? Bueller? Anyone?    EDIT   Jonnie made a good point. No, really he did. (see comments) So if you want to make a post on your blog asking if anyone is interested in becoming a member they should get in touch with one of us.

      I am confident that everyone has taken care of their obligations for the xmas in june gift exchange. This is just a reminder that you should be getting the package in the mail in the next day or two. I would hate for anyone to wake up xmas in june morning to find nothing under their xmas in june tree. If you have run into any unforeseen problems please get in touch with me.

      I would just like to preface this week's post by saying Thank You,  urlLink Urban Dictionary !  Without the intelligent, articulate definitions provided on your wonderful web page I might wander around saying inappropriate things, innocently asking people to go skiing with me or to come over for a tupperware party while unbeknownst to me I am asking them to, uhh, go  skiing  or  have a tupperware party .  Ok, I'd probably never ask anyone to come over for a tupperware party under any definition, but you get my point.  Fine, pretend you get my point.    This week I have not one, but  two  words.  My first choice,  urlLink The Telepathic Kid , I expected to be about Haley Joel Osment and dead people, and what do you know, it is, only you have to read between the lines to get the Haley Joel Osment part.  Well, maybe it requires more making of lines than reading between lines,  but it's there!  Yeah, I don't know what I'm talking about anymore either!  My second choice is one for which I contributed a definition!  See if you can guess which one I wrote.  I'll give you a hint, it's the sixth (sense...aaarrggghhhh, there's Haley Joel again!!) one.  The word is  urlLink YaYa .

OH, here's something interesting -  At the Indiana State Park, my Aunt pointed out this sign -   She told me it's where the Amish go to meet.  Thanks to Boz and Belle, it had a whole different conotation though, like it was the Amish make-out spot.  So I made her stop so I could take a picture.  I didn't actually venture down the trail though, 'cause I imagined all sorts of goings on that I'm sure had no basis in reality whatsoever.

Rest assured that this does not mean that this blog is finished, we have managed to design a series of strings and pulleys when used in conjunction with a pair of dark sunglasses and a hawaiin shirt will fool even the closest friends into believing that she is still alive and still posting on the site. Readers will find that the content, humour and wit will remain at the same standard, it is suspected that Miss Posa's brain never really did function all that well.Please send all condolences and flowers to  urlLink kitty_no_1_2000@yahoo.com.au  Please standby for further messages.

I was discussing it last night with Hubcap, and he looked puzzled. Turns out he had never heard the phrase "take a flying fuck at a rolling donut." This gave me pause. Is this a southern/country saying? Have the rest of you never heard it as well? Have you actually reached the ripe old age of *mumblemumble* without ever telling anyone to take a flying fuck at a rolling donut? Please report.  The next assignment will be: creek/brook/branch?

      It's Wednesday, and you know what that means---public service project time! This one is right down my lane, in keeping with my automotive outlook on life.  According to  urlLink this article , the Japanese are working on a car that can express emotions:   Four inventors working for Toyota in Japan have won a patent for a car that they say can help drivers communicate better by glaring angrily at another car cutting through traffic as well as appear to cry, laugh, wink or just look around.  I think it would be a big help to those Japanese inventors if we were to suggest what emotions we would want our cars to express and how those emotions might be displayed. They might not have thought of all the possibilities, you see? Anyone?

But I would return to California in three months jobless and destitute, and would it be worth it? I've already accumulated all these experiences that are disjointed and lead nowhere. I feel like a house built by a paranoiac--all these rooms you can't reach, no flow, nothing is plumb.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I'm bored and I miss Australia.&nbsp; I haven't been there in sixteen years.

      1. Dvl and Sandra will share the basement room we fondly refer to as  The Dungeon . 2. Marci and Mad will share a room because Marci is Mad, in a psychotic sort of way. 3. Belle and Nancy will share the room in the  west wing  of the house with CJ, the Monkeys and Martin Sheen. 4. Amyjo and Rosajo will share a room and they can pretend they are Kyliejo and Danijo Minoguejo.  That leaves Jonnie and I.  5. I get the third floor penthouse suite of rooms. 6. Jonnie gets the shed.

      Dear Amyjo/Ojyma,  I've recently come to grips with a terrible secret, and I need some advice.&nbsp; I'm a woman trapped in a man's body, and I need out!&nbsp; No one else knows about my hidden alter ego Stella Enigma, and my crusades as a dominatrix.  Recently, both world have come dreadfully close to clashing, and I can feel the eyes begining to wonder.&nbsp; The ramifications of letting the world know have been holding me back,&nbsp;and I love my family and friends so much that I've kept this inside for far too long.  I've also been considering a sex change operation, but I still like both oysters and snails.&nbsp; Should I start taking the hormones I've been perscribed, or should I seek counseling first?  Please help lead me out of the woods and into the valley!  Dominating,  Stella Enigma

      I think a useful public service project for this week would be to offer our advice to Sandra and Jonnie---tips to make the visit go more smoothly.   I shall begin.  1. Sandra, watch out for that sharpie marker 2. ....

      what would you choose as a new name. That is unless of course you have already had a sex change operation. I'm not trying to single anyone out but ... Is it AmyJo or Amy/Joe??? I'd choose either  Vickie  or  Jane . Hey, I'm a Gemini I can do that stuff. No wait, I'd choose the name  Gemini . I mean it's obvious, isn't it! I haven't given this too much thought, have I?

      So I was re-reading my tomes in my Sweet Valley High Library when inspiration struck.&nbsp; I want to become an internationally syndicated advice columnist, and you all can help.&nbsp; You see, I have an evil twin and she always gives me evil advice which leads me to do dumb things. But she is one funny bitch and even though I generally rue the day,&nbsp;at least I won't die riddled with regret for the things I didn't do.&nbsp; &nbsp;I myself am literal minded, kind, and sensitive.&nbsp; Between the two of us we lead me into a merry hell.&nbsp; So I figured I might as well make this whole split personality thing pay.&nbsp; So send me your pleas for advice! My evil twin and I will give you TWO answers for ONE question! Is that a deal, or what?&nbsp; You can then CHOOSE which advice you want to ignore!&nbsp; Ask me, ask my evil twin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   My evil twin is an expert on sex, lying, cheating, love triangles, evading enemy capture, and clawing her way up the social ladder.&nbsp; I am a zen buddhist who has read every self help book and non-violent communication manual there is, and I rescue bugs I find in the shower and release them into the wild instead of hammering them to pulp with my stilettos (that's her job).&nbsp;&nbsp; So if you're sensitive and want some gentle goodwill, ask me.&nbsp; If tough love, eternal scorn, and punitive language crack your whips, ask my evil twin.&nbsp; If I get enough questions I will create an advice blog where she and I can confuse, advise, and bitch with impunity.&nbsp; She's still asleep (she doesn't wake up until noon) so this is just me soliciting you for Questions!

      How about if we post some of our favorite non blog links in the sidebar? I figure up to three a piece. It's just another way of finding out a little more about each other. Here are my three most visited sites. In no particular order... 1.  urlLink Pogo , for the cribbage. 2.  urlLink One Model Place  for the pics. 3.  urlLink Kazaa Lite  ummm, just to visit because it would wrong to download music without paying for it.

      She buried them in the comments so I thought I'd dig them out and let everyone get a look at them.   Here's my initiatory haiku (in case you haven't noticed I write compulsively and overlong so I actually erased a bunch.)  I am no haiku  mere doggerel, at times I signify nothing  In San Francisco seagulls are hunger itself pigeons are tourists Amyjo

      Residents of a suburb of Philly have been a bit dismayed by the yellowish brown substance coming out of their faucets.   Residents of Plumstead's North Branch development need not worry about the yellow-brown water that may be coming out of their faucets. It may not look pretty, but it is not harmful, a township official said.   Since receiving a couple of calls last week from North Branch residents about the color of the water, the township installed a filtering system, the effects of which should have been seen this past weekend, according to interim township manager Dave Nyman.   Meanwhile, residents could continue to drink the water and bathe and wash clothes in it, Nyman said.   The wells in North Branch, which supply the public water system, typically have high iron levels. The levels are not unhealthful, Nyman said, but they can cause water to discolor.   "There's nothing that's harmful. We're looking to make it prettier," he explained.   &nbsp; For our public service project this week, I think we should help the people of the North Branch development by telling them what that stuff is that is coming out of their pipes. &nbsp; I shall start. &nbsp; People of North Branch, that substance coming out of your pipes is: 1. the rinse water left after Belle bathes her monkey...... 2 .condensation from Boz's breath after he has been drinking Jack Daniels.... 3. the water Jonnie wrings out of his swim suit after a dip in the pool.... 4. ...... &nbsp;

      ...please accept my apology... &nbsp; I have been a non-functioning (some might say "dysfuntional") house member this week, and I feel terrible about it. I have been on "vacation" getting my house ready to sell. But I'm back, and I am researching our next public service project.  &nbsp; In the meantime, let me leave you with a thought for the day: "Support bacteria; it's the only culture some people have."

      How long do you think it will be before Sandra beats the crap out of Jonnie, and what will be the straw that breaks the camel's back?  &nbsp;  I think it will be after the third night of playing Mr. Shaving Cream Head.  &nbsp;  I can just hear Sandra&nbsp;now ...  "Jonnie, Nehmen, das von Rasierschaum und ihn herauf Ihren Esel zu haften kann!"

      A practice that in&nbsp;recent days has captured my imagination. I heard about bundling from a historian (it was his quaint way of propositioning me, isn't that cute? God, I miss academics. They are SO perverse! They think and talk more about sex and are bigger deviants than anyone.) The concept wasn't exactly new to me (I know about the whole chivalric code of chaste lovers sleeping with a sword between them) but the idea a courting couple lying swaddled like mummies or infants, side by side, burning with repressed Hawthorniness--I'm captivated.&nbsp; How did they do it?&nbsp; Who did the actual bundling? Some third party, a sort of dominatrix in homespun, who swaddled the couple and then set them out side by side?&nbsp; And how were they bound, exactly?&nbsp; Were they roped, like harvest sheaves?&nbsp; Were they merely tucked in veerrry tightly?&nbsp; What if you had to pee?&nbsp; It's better than a chastity belt, that's for sure.&nbsp; It would have been oddly comforting, I think, especially on a cold night.&nbsp; All that heat and thrill and tension, immobilized in yards and yards of blankets.&nbsp; It would be like being the pea under all those mattresses in the fairy tales--this hard kernal of unsatisfied longing, muffled and muffled but still burning through, bruising and tormenting the tender flesh.&nbsp; It's really hooked into my imagination.&nbsp; Plus it's oddly&nbsp; disgusting, I imagine the trapped smells and effulgences of dirty pilgrims,&nbsp; the crawling things, the dirt and sweat, how crusty and nasty and scrufulous those blankets must have been, after a long unwashed winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's repellant and fascinating.The things people come up with the titillate themselves in the name of virtue. Anyway, I regret not trying the experience, although it could only have ended (as I am sure many puritan liasons did) in Disaster.&nbsp; Anyway, the whole idea of technical virginity or technical chastity fascinates me.&nbsp; So anyone out there with a kinky Puritan fetish, go to it and let me know what it's like.

          3 Signs You're Really, Really Sick (In Every Way)     1. &nbsp; You find yourself watching 4 back-to-back episodes of  urlLink The Ashlee Simpson Show  followed by the  urlLink A2Z  on  Jessica  Simpson ("P" is for Promise Ring, which Jessica's dad gave her so she wouldn't have sex with anyone but him... Ummm), and even worse, in your sick, sick delirium you hear yourself say "I kinda like that Ashlee Simpson."   2. &nbsp; You start answering your phone, which under normal, non-sick circumstances you just ignore, so that you can tell everyone, especially that guy from MCI that calls twice a week to ask if you want to switch your long distance service, that you don't feel good and could he bring you some orange juice and Tylenol Mega-Super-Duper strength when he gets off work?   3. &nbsp; Your mailman leaves a note in your mailbox asking if you've moved since you haven't been waiting on the steps for him everyday with cookies, a wedding license, and a glass of lemonade spiked with a date-rape drug as per usual.  And yes, when I say you I mean me, or I, or one of the voices in my head.&nbsp; I'm sick. Monkey Pox or a bad case of Karma, most likely. But! Yesterday, in my fog of death, I received   urlLink THE SUCTION CUP MONKEY OF DOOM!!!   And I'm pretty sure it has healing properties because I suction cupped it to my TV and already I'm no longer watching anyone with the last name of Simpson attempt to sing! It may be the drugs talking, or one of my alter personalities, but  Boz , you rock the casbah.  Now, the rest of you, you can send flowers or a donation in my name to the Martin Sheen Foundation For Monkeys. Thank you.

      I just found a perfect use for my extraneous bathroom sink (I have two)!  When I'm day laboring, I sweat like a bastard, so I have to at least rinse my hat at night so it doesn't reak the next day - 2nd sink makes a perfect rinse bin & I can hang the hat to dry overnight right there on the fawcett -     It's also nice that Sandra & I can have our own sinks during her visit.  Nobody will have to worry about the gritty hat since I don't plan on laboring during our vacation.

If  Del Taco  &  In-N-Out  were to become readilly available nationwide, would California then lose it's cultural significance?  3.  What's the most embarrassing thing you've said to somebody (something that made you immediately regret the comment)?  4.  It's really fun to be drunk in public, huh?  5.  Holding a pee as long as possible before release is pleasurable - yes or no?

      Where do you all stand on bikini spiders? Do they rock your world? Horrify you? Do you think they are a sign of sluttish lack of grooming, or are they an enticing hint at a bountiful bush?    I had a near death experience in Indiana over the fourth of July and while I didn't meet any spirit guides or come away with any wisdom concerning the hereafter, it did bring up the question of pubic grooming.  I went rowing on a lake and nearly drowned  because I had been wearing overalls but they were so heavy I couldn't swim in them, so I had to take them off or sink. A storm was kicking up over the lake and the waves were huge.  My puny arms were tired from unaccustomed rowing and the fucking dungarees must have weighed at least 50 pounds soaking wet.  Plus because they were baggy the drag was incredible.  I could barely keep my head up. I had to be fished out in my underwear by a fat old Hoosier on a pontoon boat.  When I rose, dripping, and collapsed on the pontoon, I looked down there they were, in all their glory--curly,friendly, peeking out and not in the least phased.  I don't know what the Hoosier thought. Let's hope he was distracted by my cleavage, or by his trick knee, or by the approaching tempest, but *I* was all too aware of their presence, and while coughing up water I kept thinking, shit, I should have shaved for this.

What, I've been watching too much Dawson's Creek again?  Oh.  Ok.  Minus that part about burning wood and the Potter B&B then.)     4.  When you go to sleep at night do you fall right to sleep or do you lie awake for a while  thinking about all the people you killed for no real reason that day, regrets, bills, Bill Clinton, and/or pie ? 5.   If Gloria Estefan had you chained up in her basement where she and her Miami Sound Machine were singing and doing the conga for you for weeks causing your ears to bleed when suddenly one day Gloria decided to run upstairs and call Ricky Martin to come over to do a duet and one of the poor burnt out members of Miami Sound Machine took pity on you and handed you his cell phone, who would you call to come rescue you?

Here is the acceptance email AmyJo sent to me.   thanks for inviting me. I am as thrilled as a little girl.  But the link doesn't work--even when I cut and paste!  Anyway, could it have expired because I didn't do it over the weekend? Please advise, I can't wait for the Real World Blog house slumber parties.  I have baby doll pyjamas all picked out.

Wackiness: 40/100 Rationality: 62/100 Constructiveness: 40/100 Leadership: 44/100    You are an SRDF--Sober Rational Destructive Follower. This makes you a font of knowledge. You are cool, analytical, intelligent and completely unfunny. Sometimes you slice through conversation with a cutting observation that causes silence and sidelong glances. You make a strong and lasting impression on everyone you meet, the quality of which depends more on their personality than yours.  You may feel persecuted, as you can become a target for fun. Still, you are focused enough on your work and secure enough in your abilities not to worry overly.  You are productive and invaluable to those you work for. You are loyal, steadfast, and conscientious. Your grooming is impeccable. You are in good shape.   You are kind of a tool, but you get things done. You are probably a week away from snapping.

      I found the link to this  urlLink quiz  on  urlLink Jer's site .  20 Questions to a Better Personality Wackiness: 88/100 Rationality: 38/100 Constructiveness: 44/100 Leadership: 34/100   You are a WEDF--Wacky Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you a menace to society, depending on how you channel your energies. You chew your fingers and have an addictive personality. Properly guided, you can be enormously productive--otherwise you run amok, stir up trouble, and generally have a hell of a good time.  To your friends, you are a source of relentless entertainment. You often get into trouble, but you almost always find a way out. You are strangely popular and feed off others' energy. You live hard, seize the day, and although your more sober friends would like to see you settled down, you generally have fewer regrets and better memories than they do. Your tenet is that, at the end of the day, one regrets only what one didn't try. You are right.  You could benefit from outside help in balancing your highs and lows. Or perhaps cutting back on the caffeine.  Take the  urlLink quiz  if you dare.

MadMathias is back from his cross country journey in which he played Dennis Hopper to urlLink  Monique's  Peter Fonda. 8. Rosa is stuffed up, but don't feel too sorry for her she's been perpetually stuffed up for the year and a half that I've known her. 9. Nancy is using stalling tactics to delay turning in her "real" self portrait, and I do not believe for one moment that  CJ  ate her homework.  I think that is all for now. Wait, oh yeah, we will be getting a new house member as soon as she replies to the invitation that I sent out yesterday. Yes, another she. Now that is really all for now.

      Ok, we all know that Jonnie has been working in a quarry, and that he used to hang around the quarries in Bloomington Indiana, and that he also was in the movie  Breaking Away . In the picture below which of the  Cutters  is  Jonnie ?

As a public service, let's add to the list of things that cause women to eat.  I shall start (basing this on personal experience)  1. Breathing 2. Feeling happy 3. Feeling sad 4. Feeling 5.

        Sherilyn's Australian Meat Pies  Favorite pie crust recipe Puff pastry for topping 3 to 3 1/2 lb Ground beef 2 Onions, minced  Beef broth  Water  Worcestershire Sauce  Freshly ground nutmeg (the secret ingredient) Salt and pepper  Flour and water, for thickening (an unusually large amount)  Egg wash to glaze.  Created by Sherilyn Sue. Schamber  Everything is done by sight and taste.  Make pie dough.  Pull just enough  dough off to fill a small tin with excess on the sides for sealing and crimping. Fork bottom in a few places so the crust doesn't rise and bubble.  Spray tin with nonstick spray.   In a large pot, cook meat and onion.  Add broth and a small amount of water to cut the strong  taste of broth.  Season with nutmeg, Worcestershire Sauce, salt and pepper.  Add flour and water mixture.  Cook and stir until thickened.  The sauce should be quite thick.  Cool the filling on top of the stove and then fill the pies.  Place a little warm water around edges of crust; cover with puff pastry; seal and crimp.  Makes holes on top with a fork for steam release.  Brush with egg wash.  Bake 350 F until tops are browned.  Cool on wire racks.    Serve with plenty of mashed potatoes, green peas, and lots of tomato sauce (Catsup.)  Meat pies maybe freeze well.  Place in freezer bags.  Reheat at 350 F until thoroughly heated.  If edges of crust start browning too quickly, cover with strips of foil.

      What a perfect 4th of July! After webcamming with Sandra most of the morning, I spent the rest of the holiday in the backyard pool -      Is there such a thing as a "Jumping Jackoff"?  I know there's an excercise called the "Jumping Jack" and I'm thinking for some reason that if you do a jumping jack off the diving board, it's called a "jumping jackoff".  I used to do them when I was 10 years old or so.   But that just as well may have been something I made up as a kid.  At any rate, jumping jackoffs hurt a lot more than I remember (in the private area) and I don't recommend them for guys over the age of 10.

      When would be a good time to meet? If Jonnie, Sandra, Dvl, and Nancy were to meet in one place, it would be the largest RW congregation ever!  If we could catch AmyJo on her way back from New Mexico, it would be half of the 10 housemates (though I don't think she spends much time on the internet outside the workplace, so I don't know how feasible that would be).  So when is a good time for everybody?  Evening?  Weekends??  LA or Orange County?? Sandra and I are pretty flexible.

      From the BBC:    Tesco plans anti-tantrum trolley   Many children have tantrums in the supermarket  Designers are working on a shopping trolley that plays DVDs, CDs and educational games for children. Supermarket chain Tesco is developing plans for what it calls the Tantrum Tamer with trolley manufacturer Wanzl.   The design features an electronic screen attached to the handle of the trolley and a seat at the back.   I think it is possible that Tesco may not have thought of ALL the possible add-ons that would help the shopping parent entertain his/her child/ren. I am certain that RW...BS housemates and readers can come up with some excellent suggestions.

      "Well, they say that santa fe is less than ninety miles away, And I got time to roll a number and rent a car. Oh, albuquerque. I’ve been flyin’ down the road, and I’ve been starvin’ to be alone, And independent from the scene that I’ve known. Albuquerque. So I’ll stop when I can, find some fried eggs and country ham. I’ll find somewhere where they don’t care who I am. Oh, albuquerque,Albuquerque. " -Neil Young  I'm going to Albuquerque tomorrow morning. If I encounter any aliens, illegal or extraterrestrial, you will be the first to know. And if I die in midair in a fiery ball of flame or spontaneously combust from parental weirdnesses, it's been lovely and pleasant. I will eat some soapapillas in the RW...BS's honor. With honey. And beer.  New Mexico is a weird place.  Both my grandfathers worked on the bomb.   I spent miserable summers in the early 1980s there--living below the poverty line, tormented by an evil stepmother and sleeping in the basement, listening to ambulances and barking dogs and convinced that if the monsters behind the furnace didn't get me, the scary borrachos outside on the sidewalks would. Or that I would simply die of my step's bitchiness and my father's lack of spine. I used to stay up all night reading out of sheer terror. Which is why I can read so fast to this day. And probably why I remember every single book I ever read as a child. Fear does wonders for the memory. We had a swamp cooler. Ever seen one? They're like primitive air conditioners, only all they do is drip water and tantalize you because they sound like air conditioners, and you keep expecting them to give you the blessed relief of air conditioners, but they don't do Shit. I used to get good old New Mexico nosebleeds all the time, too. And the sound of cicadas can still stop my heart.  I hate Albuquerque.  Especially in summer.  But then again, it's kind of an amazing city, because it hasn't changed since the 1970s.  It's like time tripping to go there.   Just as long as I don't have to sleep in the basement.

      But here's a quiz anyway.           You Are    Fool In The Rain        You are a very bizarre person, to say the least.   You don't think the way most other people do.  And you probably don't really care.   You defy convention, and probably really like burritos.  And you're very content with your life.  You're a ray of sunshine.  Piercing, bizarre end-of-the-world sunshine, but sunshine nonetheless.  While most people are going to college to be lawyers or accountants or something, you'd be just as happy working at Tippy's Taco Stand in San Dimas, CA.   You probably have a really interesting car.  You definitely do not drive a Honda Civic.  There's a good chance that you smoke weed.  There's a good chance you sell it.   Everybody worth anything likes you a lot.    urlLink Take the Which Led Zeppelin Song Are You? Quiz

So I woke up at 630 am on no sleep due to tearful breakup/why can't we try again fights the night before, thought it was 730, panicked, skipped all basic hygeine, showed up at work to find the office locked and all the coffee places closed because it was so fucking early!  So I walked the waterfront, stinking and decaffeinated and freezing my unwashed ass off, cursing the end of relationships and the sick means the unconscious uses to say "fuck you".

      Mea culpa. I was trying to pour some Melville onto the zonkboard and it couldn't handle his scintillating prose. That's what I get for trying to raise the tone of this place.  Damn! Sorry.  As penance I will now give you a quotation, at random, from Thackeray's "Vanity Fair" which has nothing whatsoever to do with Melville, but they are making a movie of it (with Reese Witherspoon) so maybe this will whet your chops.  ". ..was perverted at the Cocoa-Tree, made helplessly tipsy by this abominable suitor and perverter of youth, and fleeced of four thousand pounds."  Ah Bartleby, ah humanity!
