      I have realized that our lives are not just about our personal growth, but the growth of those we spend our lives with.  When this changes, we change too.  I have met someone very nice and sweet and special who cares more than I have ever thought possible in such a short amount of time.  I am enjoying having fun again and can't wait to see where this path leads me.  As Benny would say, "your paths should be parallel not overlapping."

      Today I typed in "erica" in yahoo's search and found ericalucci DOT com and I found it the most interesting "web" of interesting people.  I don't want to be left out and thought it seemed easy enough to become a part of it all.

      "I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.  I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty." -Philippians 4:11,12 NIV  I am not a religious person, but I do believe this.  And I do believe it transcends all aspects of our lives.  I appreciate everyday what I have and what I don't have.  Finding the balance is where we find happiness.  Every relationship, every year, every move, every opportunity we are given the chance to find that balance.  If we don't, we do eventually.  I think I do an okay job accepting my chances as they come, but I also think that I am sometimes too accepting.  I care for others deeply.  I am more afraid of hurting feelings than thinking of what Erica needs.  I cherish every friendship I have, and I hope they all know that.  =)

      I am continually amazed at how large of a world this whole blog thing is.  I have read about so many different interesting people just by searching through blog directories.  Hopefully someone may come across my blog and find it interesting as well.  Do you ever get the feeling that something is wrong, but you just can't seem to put your finger on what it is?  Maybe I am being doubtful or pessimistic, but I just have that feeling.  Maybe things have been going too well lately.  Am I controlling my own destiny just in doubting what's happening?  I am afraid of that, why can't I just let things be?  But maybe I am protecting myself from something I know is going to happen anyway?? Benny??!!?  Why?  I know, I know...  Why is that people are afraid to say the truth?  For instance, at work I am trying to make some flyers and get a project going, but all I am getting is resistance.  And why exactly?  Well, we can't seem to figure that out.  It will only benefit everyone involved, which is... Everyone!!  We aren't trying to step on toes or take over someone's job, we are trying to increase the workload!  Ah Ha!  Maybe that's it!  Maybe its more work that is causing the drama.  Oh well, its not my drama!  Should be an interesting weekend... Can't wait to move out... Again.   I would rather live with my mom and step dad anyday.

      I can say after only two weeks of school, I am already tired.  It's not that I try to do too much (which I do), it's just that I hate the whole process.  Parking is horrendous, the books are outrageous, and the people... Good lord!  I was walking to class this morning and I saw a 40+ woman with hair from the 80's wearing a Hooter's tank top that showed more than just her "rack." Can you say age spots??  I am not knocking those over 40, but know when to flaunt it, okay?  Then it was two grunge lesbians making out and hanging on each other.  I am not against homosexuals or seeing "lesbian activity," but it was not a pretty sight.  It may be mean, but I know I am not perfect and I don't claim to be.  What happened to taste?

      Life is more exhilarating everyday.  I spent all weekend with someone I adore and had a wonderful time.  No matter what we did it was easy and fun and I am very happy to have met him.  He's adventurous, sweet, caring, and a little insane.  But a little insanity is good for me.   People change, people move on, people grow, and people find their own niche... There is nothing wrong with that.  I felt bad moving on, but I know it is better for me.  I am much happier and know that I will be okay.

      I know, I missed a day, but I have been so tired and I just don't have much energy lately.  I have had a few profound conversations in the past couple of days.  Things that needed to be said were and the air was cleared.  I knew the outcome before hand, but hearing it and realizing that its exactly how I expected it to be was difficult to process.  Everything will be just fine and I am very happy with the situation as it is.  What you see is what you get, I promise!  Tonight, I get to spent time with my father and his friends, I can't wait, it should be a lovely time.  My mom is so very sweet and I love her very much.  Today I got her package for my birthday and the card made me cry, but I am such a softie!!  I miss them dearly!  Time to get back to work, no really....

      Holy fu*king shit!  I can't believe what I am reading.  The last few nights I have had conversations regarding what is going on in my life and how I am not honoring myself and then today I read this description of myself!!  I am going to give myself permission to take care of myself, since no one else can.  This says it all...  "Libra represents the Air element. It is a sign that is more extroverted and active. For Venus-inspired Libra, beauty, balance and harmony are important. There is a great need to share, to be fair and impartial. Even with this need for calm, Libra remains a very active, outwardly radiating personality. Libra is the cheerleader we all need to work together and build a team! With all of these positives here, how can the sign of The Scales be unbalanced? Sometimes loving Libra can need others too much and fall into the trap of dependency. The need for partnership leads this sign to falsely believe that there is no personhood with a partner. The temptation is to give away too much to others and reserve too little for oneself. Then life reels out of control. Trying to be too fair undermines decision-making abilities. Libra may fear making the wrong choice or upsetting others. Inward-focused energy restores balance. Libras thrive when they give themselves permission to take care of themselves."

       urlLink Why baseball is like sex and thus why it is needed in life.  I have found all kinds of interesting tidbits on the internet today.  My horoscope:  Air signs are just so intellectual. And you don't have a problem with that, either. Ideas, ideals and ideologies are more real to you than getting down in the trenches and actually doing the work that they suggest. Those jobs are for others and if you could, you'd pay them to support your theories. Meanwhile, you have important business to handle. A good cup of coffee and a good friend will keep you satisfied for hours while the world goes on doing what it needs to do. Time is irrelevant when you have so much of it.   Anyone close will understand how true this rings.  Good lord.  I am an idealist and I would love for others to do the work they suggest.  And time, hello... Benny, did you write this?  I have an abundance of time lately.  But how I spending it is where my troubles lie.  I am tired of waiting for others to keep their word.  I don't ask too much, in fact I don't ask a lot, if any at all.  Please, either be honest or keep your word.

      I didn't go to work today.  I didn't feel good and I was really tired.  I took a late nap and still couldn't catch up.  I had such a successful weekend.  I cleaned my room, did all my laundry, and even did some homework.  I had a good time Sunday with Jose.  We went to eat, and saw Cold Creek Manor.  It was good, but not as scary as we thought it would be.  Last night, I had a great conversation with Benny.  He challenged me on what I was thinking and how I was reasoning about the relationships in my life.  I appreciate that I always learn from him and I can always gain a new perspective on how I act and how I appear to others.  I know I am guarded, but I know that I let those who are important to me see what is important.  I am never dishonest, but I don't share everything that is going on in my head and my heart.  I always look to him for validation and he helps me find it for myself.  I don't have to tell everyone everything.  It's okay.  But he did tell me I need to be patient and when I learn how to be patient with what is important and not just compromising, then I will be very happy and successful in my personal relationships.  This morning, I flipped my daily quote calendar from my mom, and it read:  "Be patient with yourself and others.  There are no shortcuts to spirituality.  Growing fruit takes time." -Unknown  Could it have been anymore appropriate?  I am telling you, the timing in my life has been unbelievable lately.  Time to go, lots to do....

      I almost didn't get to vote in our very important election here in California.  I registered to vote when I got my driver's license in August, but apparently it didn't go through.  But I will vote now!  I am done waiting and giving time up for those who do not deem it important enough to honor its value.  I don't think its difficult.  I know that I do hold high expectations, but I am not sacrificing on this.  If I do, I will have sacrificed on more than just my time, but on my values and the respect I have for myself.

      Today, I am quoting a dear "prophet" of mine.  He is going on a month long trip and I will be without his quips and sarcasm.  He will be dearly missed.   "Holy Rollin’: San Francisco  Hi Y’all.  Welcome to the first of what hopefully will become many editions of my travel column appropriately called “Holy Rollin’”.  My name is Father Bill McMichael, but my congregation used to call me Papa Willy…get it?  Pop-a-Wheelie!!!  Ha Ha Ha.  God bless those beautiful little children.  First off, allow me to rant a little about myself before I begin retelling my adventures.  I’m a 58 year old former Catholic Priest turned traveler afficio-naire.  I have two dogs, Mr. Rasputin, a tea-cup Pomeranian, and Chico, a frumpy basset hound.  They are like my children and I take them everywhere I go.  Since my dismissal from the priesthood, I decided to catch up on many of the things I missed during my 38 years in “the service”, which is why I’m a regular James Bond…James VAGABOND that is!  I’ve been blessed by two great mens in my life…Fab and Andy.  Thank you for giving me the opportunity to experience my dreams of traveling and spreading the good word of the lord!  My first destination has always been a dream of mine for years.  San Francisco: The City by the Bay, is filled with spectacular sites such as the Golden Gate Bridge and the old prison-island of Alcatraz (which I didn’t visit due to apprehension caused by my impending legal matters).  San Francisco boasts a plethora of fine restaurants ranging from the best seafood near Fisherman’s Warf to Hot Italian Sausage in North Beach!  I’m not much of a seafood fan, but I did mosey on down and bought the best hot sausage in a toasted bun this side of the Bay Bridge!    I checked into my hotel and took a taxi to the nearest Kozy Komfort Kennel and checked Baby Chico and Mr. Rasputin in.  I then asked the taxi driver to take me to the “hip” bars…where all the kids go.  Usually when I travel, I don’t wear my customary priestly black, but today I felt a little sassy and decided to do so.  I was surprised that when I arrived to what the taxi driver said was a “bar tailor made for you” called the Confessional.  As I entered, I noticed that everyone was dressed in costume, which made me feel a little more relaxed about my choice of attire.  I sat down and immediately struck up a conversation with a nice gentleman by the name of Ronaldo a Cuban dissident and interior designer who was wearing a schoolboy uniform.  This is a man, who like myself, has overcome tremendous obstacles to reach his dream.  He clung onto his dead mothers breast for three days while out to sea to land ashore in Florida.  He was immediately deported and was ultimately tortured by Castro’s elite guard for treason even though he was only 3.  Two years later, when Castro allowed the mass migration, he simply boarded a boat and coasted to freedom.  He told me that if he had to do it all over again, he would have waited the extra two years and have his mother not die.  I told him that God had a plan for his mother, and that God was watching over him during that voyage and the subsequent beatings and tortures which is a testament to why he is here and today an interior designer.  We chatted until all hours of the evening about spirituality, faith, destiny, and comfortable pillows from the Horchow catalog.  Its friends like this that I make on my journey’s that make me feel that the world is still a good place.  The next morning I went back to my hotel and asked the maitre d what events are going on during the weekend.  He told me that there are many anti-war protests going on right outside the building.  So I grabbed my fanny pack and became an activist for the day!!! Liberals are always the most kind and well-spoken group of people.  Many call them hippies, but remember, Jesus was the first hippy.  We can all take our cue from Jesus and hippies.  They are such simple creatures of god’s nature.  Although unhygienic, they are Idealistic, peace loving, free-thinking, independent yet communal, always searching for a greater good, and practicing understanding.   I fit right in with them, so I let my ponytail down, took off my collar, and threw away my shoes and just “let loose”.  San Francisco is a city with many bridges, so that day I decided to build one between me and the lesbian community: two groups that never got along. They enjoyed my impromptu session of “Cumbaya” that resulted in many protesters to begin dancing erratically to the intense drum beat by a little black boy that goes by the name Racecar.  He was a very popular boy as many of the protesters came by and dropped money off into his box.  Yet, Racecar didn’t want to take the money just for his art, but rather, he sold sugar to his fans…a custom from the Chinese Jiang Dynasty.  I liked this boy so I told him my “Papa Willy/poppa wheelie joke” to him and he pulled a knife out on me and asked if I was a Narc…I told that my name isn’t Narc, but Bill.  He then swung the blade at my belly, a move customary in African Tradition as a sign of trust, and I told him that we should be friends because of his impeccable manners and understanding of ancient culture and etiquette.  I then saw a police officer and, remembering my court order, I backed off from the boy, but when I turned my head, he was already gone…probably because I didn’t urinate on his foot, the usual response to the blade swing at the belly.  I felt like a regular Judas.  That reminds me of a good joke I heard…here goes: When the Americans discovered Auchwitz and were trying to figure out who these people were, one soldier said, “Here lies the killer of the son of God”.  The commander asked, “Son how can you tell?”.  The soldier responded, “Because it’s Judas”….ha ha ha!  Get it?  Judas/Jew-dust!  Anyways, I soon discovered I had blown most of the $1000 in cash that Fab and Andy gave me for my two days and not a single Golden Gate/Alcatraz/Fisherman’s Warf snow-globe to show for it.  Oh well, the pockets may be empty, but my head is filled…with memories, that is.  I flew back home and realized that I had left my lubby dubby doggies behind at the Kozy Kumfort Kennel in SF.  Thankfully, United has a stowage policy and were able to send them to me.  I may be the vessel through which God’s work is done, but the lord didn’t make me perfect!  Until next time people.   God Bless!"

      I know, I haven't written lately for those that even read this.  But it is not about others.  It is about myself and the expression of my thoughts.  I am very busy again, working two jobs and going to school full time.  I am not sure why I do it, but I know I am getting tired.  I have been quite content in the friendships and relationships I have been creating.  The relationships that I have kept have been fruitful as well.  The relationship that I can't seem to continue on a forward path with is present more now than ever.  I don't know what to do other than live for today and enjoy those that have chosen to be in my life now.  There are those that care and I will put what little energy I have into those few.  Well, time to go from one job to the other....Doubt I will log anything this weekend.  Habitat restoration and work tomorrow.  Sunday, my only day of rest will be filled with homework and football!  Go Niners!!

      This weekend was filled with nothing but drama.  I tell you, if there was drama within 50 feet this weekend, it found it's way to me.  Friday night I was directly involved.  Saturday night I was considered guilty by association and found out that someone I thought was a good friend and wouldn't involve me in her lies, did.  And has been for some time.  I don't have the complete story of what she has been doing or saying, but I will soon and I will confront her.  How can people be so evil to each other?  As my dad says, "humans treat each other like shit.  No other species on this treat each other like humans do."  I guess it was inevitable, she always has drama and to think that I could steer clear of it for so long, I was kidding myself.  I can't decide if I want to walk away from something or stick around to see if it could work.  In the long run, I am not the one for the role and that's how it seems I would be perceived.  Busy day today, lots of cleaning.  It was therapeutic.  Scary....

      I can't believe how almost every single time I come across someone I want to be with, something happens.  How am I suppose to deal with this?  I think my best alternatives are becoming a nun or becoming lesbian.  I find women attractive.  I don't know if I could actually go through with the act, but it does seem kind of enthralling.  The whole nun thing, I don't mind spending time by myself.  I enjoy the peacefulness of silence.  But to pray and live for God everyday of my life, I am not so sure.  I have the slightest idea as to my beliefs on God.  I don't know, I just want to be happy and find someone who wants to be there to be happy with me-no questions asked.  Possible???? Doubt it...

      Another drama filled weekend has come and gone, thankfully.  I was quite content in staying home Saturday night.  I would have enjoyed some company in my quiet home, but the sleep was well needed.    Sunday's football was horrific.  The only good thing from the games on Sunday was the Cowboy's loss.  Sorry to say, but it was a nice shut out! =)  I have distanced myself from a few that seem to need me.  I can't bring myself to let those relationships continue on the same paths they were headed.  If I was confident they would be different, I would put myself out there again, but I can't.   I can't figure out if I am being used, if I am convenient, or I am genuinely wanted, desired, and loved.  It will be shown soon.  I don't think it will last if it is fake.  I can't wait to be done with school!  I am so tired of working both jobs and studying and all of the other crap like driving at least an hour of every day.  It is getting old, but I still have 2 1/2 years to go!! Urghhhh!!  Lator Gators!!

      Nothing is wrong, per say, but I am just dumbfounded by how people treat each other.  I spend too much time and energy into making sure I am kind and fair to people.  I do not expect as high of standards from others because I know that is unreasonable.  However, as a person, with feelings, I do expect some level of respect.    It's just school starting to stress me out!!  Just past the halfway mark I start to get stressed and nervous about how I am doing.  I always pull it off, but I can't seem to diminish the stress.  I am trying to deal with it though.  Putting my health in check definitely helps.  I am forcing myself to keep up with meds and doctor visits.  I am not nearly as tired when I take my iron. I KNOW!!!  I don't need anymore mothers, please.  I have to want to do it, and I do....  All I can say is "Thank Goodness its Thursday!!!!"

      This past weekend was much better in terms of drama.  I am still unsure of the direction of a few of my life paths right now, but the fog seems to be thinning and the distance in front of me seems to be shortening.  I feel pretty even keel right now.  I had two days of good productive conversations.  The air was cleared and peace was achieved.  I still think I have a hard time letting go of the past or past relationships, but I have learned so much in the last 3 years that I don't think it is unfair to hold onto some of the memories.  School is flying by, good lord!!  6 weeks left.  Before I know it will be over! Thursday I schedule next semester!  I cant wait!  Hasta...

      Yesterday I went to the doctor figuring we would make appointments for me to start my iron IV.  I was quite surprised when I was being walked over to the Infusion Center to get my test dose and IV.  I was there two hours and survived the test dose.  There were four nurses with an oxygen tank ready to bring me out of a deadly allergic reaction if I was to have one.  I didn't thankfully.  But the IV Benadryl and Tylenol were strong enough to make me stay home from class and sleep.  I needed it.  Now I have to go for the next five weeks, every Wednesday for 6 hours and get my iron IV with the chemo patients.  It was a reality I am not prepared for and definitely wasn't yesterday.  Life bites...

      Well, had my first IV treatment.... After one hour they can turn up the infusion rate so they did.  I had an allergic reaction.  Broke out in a rash and got all flushed.  They stopped the iron and gave me more Benadryl.  That seemed to make it worse so they gave me a steroid that helped it go away, but left me very puffy and achy.  I feel like I was run over yesterday.  I should have stayed home in my nice cozy bed and vegged all day today.  But that is not Erica, she is not capable of doing that... She goes and goes and goes until she can't go any longer.    I can't wait to see my family next week!  My brother is getting so big!  Mom sent me a pic of him with his freshly built snowman!  I can't believe how big he is getting.  I miss him so much, I wish I could be closer to them.    This whole relationship drama is driving me nuts!!  Ok, I know that I should not allow myself to accept less than I want or allow those unworthy have some of me but not the rest.  I don't know what I am capable of myself and allowing those people to be in my life even for what little it is, seems more worthwhile than not at all.  Is that so wrong??  I know that there isn't anyone in my life right now willing or able to give more.  I know that I am unable in many ways to give more of myself as well.  So, is going with what is so wrong?  Is allowing what is possible to happen, so wrong?  I am trying to do my best and get the best from what is available to me.    I have spent quite a bit of time thinking of the past lately.  Things weren't perfect, but they were definitely oriented a lot more towards me and taking care of me.  But as I type that, I guess it isn't as true as my heart thinks it is.  I don't know.  I am actually getting to the point where I don't care.  I have bigger and better things to worry about, like my health.  The next step if the iron IV doesn't work is blood transfusions.  And I certainly don't want that.  Unless my mom can give me the blood.  She would and we have the same blood type so I know I wouldn't' be getting anything dangerous.  Enough already, later....

Slept on Sunday, haven't had male interaction in a while.... But I do it to myself!  Gotta get back to work or at least look like I am!  IV treatment number one tomorrow, cant wait!

      Wednesday went well!!  No reaction, got the full dose, little mishap with the IV, but everything went okay!  I am feeling good though.  The only thing I don't like is the amount of saline I get, I feel puffy and my joints are stiff from all the fluid in my body.  Guess I shouldn't complain too much.  Yesterday was great!  Drove up to Murphy's Wednesday night and got to hang out with the family.  My pumpkin cheesecake was well liked.  I am bummed I had to come home last night and come to work.  Oh well.  Some people do not understand that they attract drama and do not do anything to stop it.  I am getting tired of hearing the same crap everytime... Especially when I have nothing to do with it!!  But it could be worse, it could be my drama!!  Should be a fun weekend....

      I think I am catching a cold.  I didn't feel good this morning so I decided to sleep in and not go to class.  No big deal, not going to learn anything special today anyway.  Actually attempting to work today, want to finish the crap I am working on because its boring.  Clase de espanol esta noche y luego voy a cocinar tres pumpkin cheesecakes por manana. Estoy cansadisima!

      The Spanish word of the day section is a link, it updates on it's own....  Interesting weekend, had way too much too drink Saturday night, didn't feel better until about 10 o'clock Sunday night.  I had lots of fun, though.  Saw someone I went to high school with and met some new people.  Will probably go there a lot more often than I thought I would.  This week is going to be rough and tiring, but I get to see my family!  Can't wait.  Well, it's time to work!

      Had an okay weekend.  Went out Friday night after getting off early from one job and not having to work the other!!  Saturday was okay, too.  Nothing special.  Yesterday I went to Stockton and then to Sacramento to spend time with my mom and family before they left this morning.  I received this as an email a while back and I was cleaning out my mailbox and thought a few were applicable right now in my life so I thought I would post them!  Enjoy!  Life isn't like a box of chocolates, it's more like a jar of jalapenos, you never know that's going to burn your ass.  I can only please one person per day. Today is not your day. Tomorrow  is not looking good either.  I love deadlines. I especially like the Whooshing sound they make as  they go flying by.  Tell me what you need, and I'll tell you how to get along without it.  Accept that some days you are the pigeon and most days the statue.  Needing someone is like needing a parachute. If he isn't there the  first time, chances are you won't need him again.  I don't have an attitude problem, you have a perception problem.  Last night I lay in bed looking up at the stars in the sky and I  thought to myself, where the hell is the ceiling?  My reality check bounced.  On the keyboard of life, always keep one finger on the escape key.  I don't suffer from stress. I am a carrier.  You are slower than a herd of turtles stampeding through peanut  butter.  Everyone is someone else's weirdo.  Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level then beat  you with experience.  A pat on the back is only a few centimeters from a kick in the butt.  Don't be irreplaceable - if you can't be replaced, you won't be  promoted.  After any salary raise, you will have less money at the end of the  month than you did before.  The more Shit you put up with, the more Shit you are going to get.  You can go anywhere you want if you look serious and carry a  clipboard.  So this isn't Home Sweet Home ... Adjust!  Ring bell for maid service. If no answer, do it yourself!  I clean house every other day. Today is the other day.  I came, I saw, I decided to order take out.  Blessed are they who can laugh at themselves for they shall never  cease to be amused.  I'd live life in the fast lane, but I am married to a speed bump.  What should you give a man who has everything? A woman to show him how to work it!  How can you tell which bottle contains the PMS medicine? It's the one with bite marks on the cap.

      It has been some time since I have written, but i am in Washington with my family enjoying the torment of my eleven year old brother, but I love him dearly.  I want to wish the few that read this a very Merry Christmas.  I love you all and hope the season has been treating you well.  I am thinking of you and know that everything will work out as it is meant to.    I finished finals with a 4.0 for the semester.  Too much work and too much stress to say the least.  I finished my 5 weeks of treatment only to be scheduled for three more.  Oh well!!  I am feeling better and I know it is improving my health and well being!  Until mext time, promise there will be more before the new year, but only if I have comments!!! =)

      Treatment went well yesterday, except my arm is sore and getting the IV started was a little more difficult than normal.  The nurse suggested that if this is something I am going to have to do for the rest of my life that I should think about getting a life port put in.  A life port is inserted in your chest beneath the skin and is a stint into a vessel.  It is much easier than being stuck every time and looking like a drug addict.  I am not so sure if I like the idea... but maybe after I do some research of my own I can come to a better decision about it.  A day of work, then a night of play!!

      Well, its back to work and starting off the year as I spend them, working...  School starts Monday and we start working Saturdays this Saturday.  Oh Boy!  I have my next IV treatment tomorrow and then the next two Fridays.  Won't do anymore until tax season is over, I can't afford to take the time off.  Should be a fun weekend though!!

      Well, it has been a long, but quick week.  First week of school down, only 15 left to go.  I think I am really going to like the classes I picked out.  La clase de espanol es muy divertido.  Me gusta la profesora.  Ella habla solamente en espanol. Debate is going to be fun, I can tell.  The professor is crazy.  Treatment went well yesterday, asked again about the port and the other nurses thought it would be a good idea too.  Well, once this work day is over, its a homework day tomorrow and it begins all over again!!

Back to school today, it should be fun, I have Spanish and Human Communication today, oh boy!  Getting to fight the traffic nightmare is always the best part.... urrrggghhh!!

      Treatment went well yesterday, it is my last one!!  Well, until I feel like I am getting tired and not well again.  But, this last treatment should have put my hemoglobin level almost to 13 so I should be okay for awhile....

      There is nothing more impressive when people admit to being selfish, oh wait... yes there is, when they do something to change it or attempt to treat others with the respect they deserve.  I give and give and give and hardly get anything in return.  Ok, I do, but it is rarely positive nor beneficial to my life.  I don't know why it is so hard to be either honest or respectful to those who give of themselves to you.   just a thought for today....

      Sorry, I know, I haven't been blogging as consistently as I used to, but tax season is upon us and there just doesn't seem to be as much time in the day now.  Quite busy, but busy is good, keeps me out of trouble!  I added the new "Atom" feature, it's suppose to increase the number of places my blog shows up.  We will see...  Classes are going well, I am really enjoying spanish and debate.  Geology wasn't a bad choice, not sure how interested I am, but it's fairly easy.  And Human Communication is ridiculously boring, but gotta fulfill those general ed. requirements!

      Ok, I can't believe that tax season is over and it has been since January 29th since my last entry.  That is terrible, that might explain why I have been so emotional lately... I haven't expressed my feelings and vented lately.  But this music I am listening to isn't helping...   You get to a point where you wonder when in the hell is something going to happen...  I just feel like I am in a period like the calm before the storm and I am not sure if its good or bad.  I feel like I am in a period of not knowing... not knowing what is going to happen, where I am going to be, who I am going to meet... it is frightening, but it can't be any worse than where I am at right now.  With nothing...  And with nothing I mean, no one, or at least no one there for more than their own interests.  Is it so difficult to think of someone else besides yourself?  I thought it was the point to this journey we are on, to meet others, be with others, learn from others... I guess I am on a different journey than most.  I do know that my path does not seem to be running parallel to anyone else's right now.  It sure seems to cross many other paths, but none worth changing course for...  Until the next time..

      I want to get better at staying current with blogging so here is my latest attempt.  I just downloaded Hello!, a picture uploading program to add pics to your blog.  Its easy to use and free, cant get much better than that!  I thought I should add a pic to my blog since I took them out of my profile online.    I have been feeling much better lately.  Keeping my stress level down, eating better, and having someone special to spend time with have helped more than I could have imagined.    I am very happy!    Not exactly ready for summer school to start, but I am anxious to continue on and finish with school!!

      It is amazing how quickly feelings can grow and how quickly you can see your life path change.  I have and I am completely amazed at how wonderful it feels.  I didn't think I would meet someone as special as Rich and I did.  I know he has a hard time expressing himself at times, and at others it is no big deal. I know I should take what I get and I do, but sometimes it still takes me aback and I realize that I am very lucky and hopefully I will have him in my life for a very long time..
