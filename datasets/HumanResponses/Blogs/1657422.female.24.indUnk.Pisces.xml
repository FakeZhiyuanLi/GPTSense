      I just wanted to give a shout out to Justin for being so awesomely accomodating by taking me to see the Garfield Movie this past weekend. I've been an avid Garfield fan/collector for most of my life, so I knew when he came out with a movie that I would have to go see it (they'd kick me out of the club otherwise). So Justin donated 90 minutes of his time on a Saturday night and shelled out $18.50 (NJ movie prices are ridiculous--another reason to live in the 'burg!) to make me happy. It was a cheesy kids' movie of course, but it was cute, and I can't express my gratitude enough to Justin for putting up with the kid in me. :D

      Ah, I miss Ren and Stimpy . . . Anyways, hi there and welcome to my blog! If you're here, you probably know me and are one of the few people I still talk to on a regular basis--thanks for stopping by to read what's been going on with me! Or you're like me and check IM away messages constantly throughout the day and got the link from there. If you don't know me, I'm not sure why you're here, but feel free to read on anyway!   So I've been meaning to start a blog for awhile now and just never got around to it. I guess I was putting it off partly for fear that I'd only post every three weeks or something, and then I'd feel bad I didn't spend more time on it. But Justin encouraged me to do it, and I enjoy reading his, so I thought there might be a few people out there who'd like to take time away from playing games while making it look like they're working to read what I post. Maybe it'll even be entertaining... So I guess this marks my official (albeit belated) entry into geekdom. No turning back now!  So this is just a post to say welcome, stay as long as you like, and please come back from time to time! I'll be posting as often as I can--or as often as I have something to say, which, knowing all of the exciting things going on in Harrisonburg, will be all the time!! /sarcasm    ...It's Better Than Bad, It's Good!!

       Before I write what I want to say about the Convention this week, I wanted to give a little background on what got me to this point, because I'm sure some of you will be surprised to see me involved in politics...    When I was growing up and even through most of college, I never paid much attention to politics, or even to current events. I think when we're young and haven't ventured away from home much, we tend not to see how these things affect us. What goes on in Washington seems to be so removed from our lives that it doesn't matter. And those few times when I did try to watch the news in order to be more informed, I just got frustrated by all the crime and negativity that local news channels tend to focus on. And politicians always seemed to be doing something underhanded or self-promoting, so I dismissed politics as something I'd rather not be involved in.   September 11, 2001, was the first day my opinions started to change. It gave me such a jolt that I knew I'd have to leave the protective bubble I'd spent most of my life in to that point. I started watching news daily, listening to NPR, reading Newsweek. My eyes were opened to a whole new world I'd never realized was there. And it made me realize that these things affect my life in a big way.   So I was learning about the world, keeping up on current events, and I thought my eyes were pretty open. But another jolt came when I saw Bowling for Columbine. I thought it was an amazing movie and among other things, it made me be more critical of the information I was receiving on a daily basis.   At this point I considered myself fairly well-informed. I wasn't just soaking in information, I was analyzing it, finding out more, trying to determine what was credible and what was suspicious. But despite all this knowledge, I wasn't really  doing  anything.  I mostly have "W" to thank for that. Granted, I didn't vote for the man, but I stood by him when our nation was in a time of crisis and I was ready to go wherever he led this country. But gradually I saw how he was steering us way off course, alienating our country's friends, and totally ignoring the people who had entrusted him to protect us and make this country a better place. Soon I knew this guy had to go.  The credit doesn't all go to Bush II, though. Several months ago, I heard that Al Franken would be hosting a new radio show, so I decided to tune in. I always liked his Stuart Smalley character... Well Stuart Smalley this was not. But it was better. He talks frankly on a daily basis about the awful things this administration is doing and about what needs to happen in this country. And he's definitely no Rush Limbaugh. He listens to people, gives facts to back up his information, admits when he's wrong, tells people what they can do to get involved, and does it all with a little humor thrown in. I listen to it religiously now, and it has inspired me to want to take an active role in what goes on in this country. For that reason, I'm doing something this year that I've never done before--voting. I know, shame on me. But if we learned anything from the last presidential election, it's that every vote CAN make a difference (or  should , and  will  as long as they're all counted...::rolleyes::) And I've finally found a candidate who I think is a perfect fit. 1. He's not Bush (that says a LOT...) 2. He stands for so many of the things I believe in. 3. He has a vision for this country that I believe in wholeheartedly and want to see come to fruition. In case you hadn't guessed, his name is John Kerry. :D ( To be continued in my next entry... )

      Over the years, we all accumulate things that we don't necessarily need, or buy new things that make the old obselete. Somewhere along the way, some brilliant (and maybe a little greedy) person, realizing that one man's trash is another man's treasure, invented the yard sale.   So I've accumulated as much unneeded junk as the next guy... OK, possibly more than the next guy, which is why I decided it was high time for a yard sale. I pulled together a nice pile of junk, tagged everything with prices, made signs, and waited for the customers to come. Justin's friend Brian and his fiancee Jennifer came over and brought some of their stuff too to add to the appeal.   We didn't have to wait long before the customers came trickling in. Our road is fairly busy, so it was a good spot for pulling potentional customers in off the street. We haggled, we talked, we sunburned... and in the end, we made almost $150 all together! Who knew junk could be so valuable?! And I've got plenty more where that came from...

      So Justin and I were looking into getting a new monitor for my computer. After looking into it, we figured we might as well just buy a whole new computer since it's not that much more expensive. But then we started thinking that if we were gonna get a new computer, we might as well go all out and get a nice one. So here I am looking at the monstrous 20" screen of our new iMac. I've always wanted to give an Apple a try but was a little scared of jumping into unknown territory, being that I'm so used to PCs. But man, this thing is niiiice! It's great for doing stuff with photos and there's a neat program where you can write songs with all sorts of different instruments. I can't wait to play with it all a little more. Justin's even more excited about it than I am, so I have a feeling we'll be fighting over it most evenings. Guess we'll have to start learning how to share...

      The country that gave millions of drunk people the opportunity to prove in front of a crowd that they can't carry a tune now has given video-game-junkie white males a chance to redeem their reputation for having two left feet... Yep, move over Karaoke, Dance Dance Revolution is here! In case you're not up on this fad that hit arcades several years ago and is now sweeping video game players' homes, here's how it works: Instead of a hand-held controller, players use a large pad on the floor like this:      The screen gives you a series of arrows to step on at specific times to the beat of the music, with dozens of songs of varying speed and difficulty. This addictive game is the latest addition to our "game room"--though it's as much a workout as it is a game. A word of warning to those who haven't tried it before: as corny as you think it is beforehand, you will get addicted.
