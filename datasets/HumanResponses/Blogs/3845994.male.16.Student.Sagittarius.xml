       "Brotherhood",  was rather nice, i knew the general outline b4 the show liao one. Nk pushed to Busan den SK pushed back to China's borders, den SK got pushed back to 38th parallel. Yah but didn't expect such a touching brotherly movie,  Won Bin  and  Zhang Dong Jian  really played vv well, i was moved to tears man. Haha throughout the show, there was no shuai ge other den the 2 main actors. Haiz... so my deduction that there is no shuai Korean guys is really true. But  Won Bin  really looks vv shuaiz man.  Oh yah, i watched it with me "brothers" and that includes my Part Alpha(Sec 1) Platoon sergeant,  Eldine @@ Haha long time no see him liao, he still looks like a little kid haha. Anyway, it was really good watching the show with my real "brothers" But i think " Saving Private Ryan " is still our favourite movie of all times... Ok&nbsp;i wanna watch " Super Size Me " and more movies........ So tired.....Gonna do essay&nbsp;outline liao...&nbsp;

      After a small talk with Jimmy today made me realise one thing Hse Cap '04 is no longer the past Hse Cap Noms '04. So sad case. Dun wanna talk about it liao. Anyway some other topic. Yah we will talk about homosexuality. I believe that it is a endowment, not a mistake or a choice. If he or she wants to be this way, den let it be, what for go and slaughter or discriminate. Anyway there are successful gay marraige in the world look at Reichen and Chip, form AR4, they beat all the "straights" outright and living their lives the way they want it... So sad that people think that homosexuality is a mistakes or even a dieaseas... Reichen And Chip Happily Together  urlLink    HCN04&nbsp; urlLink

      This is a race like none other, this is the Amazing Race!  The Amazing RAce 5 has started! I am damn excited about it espcially when the race starts to get fast-paced. Anyway let's get on to the show.   The start was already very exciting. I was trying to look for a few teams to support. of course, they have to be shuai or pretty to get onto my list.   Anyway i picked the following three:  Alison and Donny   Dennis and Erika Kami and Karli  The race started off and at first Dennis and Erika were with all my favorite teams, however, they are so thick and bought the wrong tics. It cost them their game man! The race was pretty boring for the first time when all times were all so stereotypical and all the same. But got some interesting features like the short girl, Charla. But overall it was below expectation. The places they visited was not very exotic or anything interesting. SO i am putting Uruguay last on my future holiday trips... But the hand on the beach looks interesting enough so cute.  And OH MY GOSH! The twins girls were so thicK! They walk pass the clue without seeing it!! They are really typical blondes man!!  And anyway at the end of the show, Erika and Dennis are eliminated, so sad, they could have pulled through, i hate the old army man now! Go home and play with your boots and uniform! Sianz... i lost my eye candy (Guy or Gal u guess haha!!) Anyway Alison and Donny (A&D) did me proud by coming in first so got something to look forwrad ro liao. Looking forward to the OC! tml so for now nitez nitez stranger!

       This is a nice song from Hoobastank-- "The Reason" It is rather reflective of my situation now...  I'm not a perfect person As many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear  I've found a resaon for me  To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You [x4]  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you
