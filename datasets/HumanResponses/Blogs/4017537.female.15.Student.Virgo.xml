        Aaaahhhrg. I just wiped out my post. I accidentally hit the back button. No worries, though. I'm somewhat in the mood to write tonight. Very rare. I'm sitting here eating a vanilla pudding pop (which strangely looks something... you know what it is) and listening to my Launchcast Player. I love that freakin' thing right now I'm listening to Pearl Jam. I just went to our newspaper's website and found out that our new band director is going to be Mr. Bartz. Supposedly, he just graduated from college in March, 2004! He's a young one! Young ones are normally pretty strict (after a while), believe it or not. Hopefully, he'll be pretty cool. Yea. Keems just called me and we ended up talking for a few minutes. Wow! It would be awesome if I had some sour straws right now. I kinda don't mind going back to school now. Normally, I hate school. A lot. But this year, it's ok. I want to see my friends, yes, but I also feel more comfortable with things. I don't mind my classes (as of yet), I know the school inside and out, etc. I just hope that I have some classes with some of my friends. I know that a lot of them are having A lunch this year. Maybe I'll have some more lunches with Sara this year. I know that I don't have any classes with her. I know I have a few with Nate and possibly one with Courtney. Besides that, I don't know who I have my classes with. I just hope that not all of my classes are with people I don't know/don't like. Last year, I only had about two classes with friends. I just hope that next year will be better than last year. Last year was... blah. Not too good, not too bad. Just a lot of nothing. I'm going to go write an e-mail. Peace!

        I'm having a good night tonight. Not for any special reason. Probably because I'm talking to all my friends. Nate, Keems, some other people. I have a weird feeling tonight. I don't know what to call it. I'm happy, inquisitive, excited, creative, "into" the music (whatever that means), and everything else all jumbled into one. I'm really happy because I just burned some Nirvana cds and also Greenday and Third Eye Blind. I need to go to the library so I can get some more cds to burn. I feel like playing Dance Dance Revolution now but that would mean I have to turn off the radio and I don't want to do that. And you know what? Someone wants to be my blueberry popsicle. Weirdo.&nbsp;Damn. I wish I felt like this all the time. I need some more Diet Coke. I'm addicted. I'm so addicted to you... and you're suck a dick to me. I think I'm getting arthritis. But I think it's just because I've been typing nonstop for hours. I'm going to go now. Peace.

        I'm hoping that my camera film from when I went to Europe turns out. There are a few valuable pictures there.&nbsp;Especially the&nbsp;pictures from the party Katie, Danielle, Francesca, Nadja ,and I went to. No one's online now. Keems went to the mall, Nate and Courtney went to the concert, and Jason is at a reception with Katie. I would listen to music but for some reason, the computer is being spooty and won't let me. I've started having dreams about school again. I always start having dreams about school a month (at least) before it starts. Unfortunately, school will be starting the exact day of my  birthday!  It isn't fair. That night, I have band rehearsal. At least I won't be totally alone. Sara will be there too. Sara and I really need to do something. I haven't seen her since school has been out!!! I was in Europe for 3 weeks, Pennsylvania for one, I've been at my dad's, and I've been at my grandma's, so we haven't been able to do anything. Last time we tried, it didn't work out because Sara got the job at McDonald's. Congrats, Sara. I hope you can rake in the dinero so you can get me a job and chauffeur me around. Haha. You know you will be. I haven't been able to see any of my friends, though. It sucks. Don't get me wrong, though... I do NOT want to go back to school just to see my friends again. I'm just not like that. Jason, Katie, and I might go to the zoo tomorrow. That should be fun. Last time we tried to go to the zoo, we got rained out. I think I'm going to go play some pool. Adios, mis amigos!

       Here I am sitting at the computer desk in the dark, listening to some Alice in Chains. Perfect. Anyway, I'm trying to make this whole blog thing work out. My friends all have blogs. It became popular for some really odd reason. Everyone wants me to get one. I'm always sooo bad at keeping up with these things. I've had&nbsp;four now and every time, I've posted&nbsp;two times at the most? I never was good at keeping regular (on paper) diaries either. I'm going to try though. Not just because I'm being encouraged to, but because I think it would be a&nbsp;nice thing to keep. I don't guarentee anything. I'm certainly not a writer, so&nbsp;don't expect wonderfully written stories about my life.&nbsp;You won't get that.&nbsp;Oh&nbsp;yeah. My name is Kaitlyn... and&nbsp;I'm a junior in high school. I have a few friends. I'll tell you more about them later. And more about me. I have stuff to do!

       My mom, my dog, and I went on a walk. My dog was soooo happy because he hadn't been out for a walk in a long time. Then, I when I got home, I took a shower. Now, I have the radio on in the kitchen. I got the Chicago rock station in. I would be more happy if it wasn't in the kitchen. I tried to get it to come in on the radio in my bedroom. I'm so happy because I found a bunch of stuff that fell behind my dresser a long time ago today: my hat, chapstick, an earring (that I really missed), and a a Chinese hair stick thing. No one is online now. Ah. I take that back. Denny is online. I haven't talked to him in a realllly long time. Not like I ever really talked to him that much before. Basically all I did was try to keep him from taking his life. He's an idiot. I don't know why he' iming me right now. Ah. so he says "Hey." and so I say the same. He doesn't talk for a while so I say "..." and he says "fuck u." That's nice. I don't feel like typing right now so I'll keeps this short. Not like anyone reads it anyway.

      I haven't really had a chance to be online a lot recently so I haven't updated. I haven't done anything any different this week. Yesterday Sara and I were going to meet the new teacher yesterday but she ended up having to work. Then Keems called me and we talked for a while until she had to go. Then Sara called me and we talked for a long time. I still have a good feeling about this year (knock on wood). Hopefully, that's true at least. I looked at my mom's old year books today. I realized some things: my uncle looked like a bum then, too, my dad looked a lot different, and everyone wore afros. Yes. Even my uncle and Dad. Aaahhh the Peace Pipe. And now I'm going to try and find something to eat. I doubt I'll find something, but it's time for lunch and I'm hungry.
