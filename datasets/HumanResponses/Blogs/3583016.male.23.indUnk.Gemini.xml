      I think I worry too much about stuff sometimes. For example; I worry about life in general and mostly about people. I could care less about what happens to me or where my life is headed. My life is already messed up anyway. Nevertheless I worry about people a lot. Why? I don’t know. I worry about what they do, where they my end up and what they think about me. Wouldn’t you like to know what someone really thinks about you? I do. Maybe that’s a sad thing but I always wonder what someone’s impression of me is. That’s how I’m so good at judging what kind of character a person has and whether it’s good or bad because I pay attention to their actions and behavior. I may be contradicting myself by worrying about what people think about me and yet I don’t give a dam about myself. Do I make sense?   My point is; that by paying attention peoples actions I can then determine how to approach that person. Approaching that person could mean many different things, whether it’s just asking for help with something, for the time or even for a date. Most people can just be themselves when it comes to those things. But as for me I think about how to approach that person because by my actions, I can then have a better relationship with that person. I’m still being myself but I pay more attention to their actions because that’s how I know what to do and what not to do. Other people can care less about such things and to be honest sometimes I just give up being nice and just do things out of spite… p-blog  Anyways; I believe it’s always good to have a great impression towards someone because if you don’t then they will always, in some way or another think not so highly of you. I know this for a fact. When someone thinks not so highly of you, especially your friends, family, co-worker or whoever, it can then create a ripple effect of rumors and bickering which can lead to many other negative things that can surround you. I could go on but it brings me back to my point. Don’t you really wish you knew what people think about you?   I do know what some people think about me. I can’t change they way they think about be, I can try if wanted to but oh well. To each is own.

      It’s Friday! Let’s see what I did. I painted all day :) it was the unfinished painting that has been hanging over my bed for the last year. So I worked on it today, oh! I’ll post it on my art blog when it’s done don’t worry. It’s a pretty nice painting of a sunset with clifs on the right side. The only thing is I don’t like the way I did my water reflection. I need to work on that for my future paintings that involve water. So that’s what I did all day today. Then after dinner I went to the Autobon? to see Mother Courage perform and other talented artists. It was cool but I would have rather been at the movies looking at TROY. But I have to support my fellow Bahais in my community. The music was pretty good; it made me think about stuff. Angelica and Perica did an African dance which was cool. Pericia was all into it. That was fun.  So anyway Crystal and I aint happening. I’m not really digging her. Don’t want to get into details but she just aint my type and so I’ll just let us be friend if even that. Which sucks for me but oh well back to the drawing board. See if I was a playa now I won’t be having this problem with girls. The sacrifices I make to try to be a good guy *_*    “Hope is what I have and yet oblivious to the life ahead of me but I keep striving with determination to reach my goal and attain my rightful place in the heavens”  zino   "The promise day has come, the day when tormenting trials will have surged above your heads, and beneath your feet, saying: 'Taste ye what your hands have wrought!'" "Soon shall the blasts of His chastisement beat upon you, and the dust of hell enshroud you" "And when the appointed hour is come, there shall suddenly appear that which shall cause the limbs of mankind to quake."  Baha’u’llah

      How about Crystal called me today; well I called her back and we talked for about a whole hour or so. Yeah! It was a great conversation and I know she enjoyed it coz I had her laughing and you know I know to keep a conversation anyway. I tried to talk about her for the most part and she showed some interest in where I was from and stuff. We talked about her family, the places she has visited, her friends and most of all about her.   She’s a pretty cool person to talk to. Very laid back with the conversation; well I tried to make it a laid back conversation. The only thing that’s a down side about her is... Well 2 things which I rather not say on here but I’ll put it in my private blog. It’s really not that serious. Just wish I had my cake and can eat it too, that’s all. And I’m talking about the cake ok! Hehehe…  Well I hope she calls me tomorrow or something coz I really like talking to her and hopefully we can go out sometime soon I hope. I’m not going to have my hopes set too high but I hope this is some sort of good luck thing for now.

      Well today was an ok day. I guess, except it started out too early. This dumb ass lady called me at 9 in the morning. 9! It’s Saturday for Christ sake; she called me to remind me that I had an appointment with JR at this ACFitness club. So I couldn’t go back to sleep after she called. Well 12 cam and I was up and ready to go... J and I went together. This JR dude was talking a whole bunch of crap like I didn’t know how shit works. I use to be a member there before. So I’m acting as if this was all new to me. Boy was he throwing all the pitches at me for me to join the club. But after he wasted his breath with his lame proposals I told him I’ll give him a call.. right.  I got back home; made J a CD for $2 hehe.. got to make that money Playa! He got a discount coz he my boy, then when J left I went out with my other boy Don to play ball with Lamont who is his brother and his boys, called Jason up so he can bring his crew at the gym then I saw some other cats I knew. Did u get all that? So we played ball, got home around 4:30 something and then I went for a swim.  Mom made a wonderful dinner. It was Fish with mash potatoes, Corn and a salad. U would pay $12 for that at a restaurant. I was stuffed.. but had to wash dished so I worked it off. Well After dinner I came on my computer and tried to organize my music collection. Musicmatch is a good program to use if u have lots of music, a fast computer and time to organize them.   Anyways I got online around 8 something and chatted will Shelli up to now. She was modeling her clothing her mom made her. May I add that I have a hott! God Sister... " But anyways she keep bugging about if she looks older than 16. She looks older than 16 but not by much maybe 18 the most and I know she want to date older guys, that’s y she kept asking me, trying to see if she can pass for 18. Teenage girls, always wanting grown men!

      Today was an ok day. I had to work as usual and after I got home I decided to sit outside and ponder about some things. While sitting on the back of my parents car, I happen to see this girl walking her dog. I’ve see her before. She lives in the apartment house next to mine. I wanted to talk to her before but I never really got the chance coz I’m always so busy working my ass off. She’s black with a well toned body and baby got back; looks like she works out. Need I say more?   Well she went out of her way to walk her dog by me. I know this because the grassy area to walk her dog was on the other side. So naturally I knew she wouldn’t mind if I spark up a conversation. Well I said hey and she said hey back. She kept on walking her dog. So I then though, well maybe I was wrong and she really was walking her dog near me. Well like a minute went by and she then came up to me and started talking to me. I was like wow!. Ok. So we got the chatting. She’s 20 goes to UNC and her name is Crystal. She then asked if I had any plans for tonight. I said no. I then said what r u doing tonight? She said going out. My dumb ass should have said where. But no, I said nothing. I said that’s cool. She had to go get ready for going out so we ended the conversation on a rather good note. I did not want to ask her for her phone no# as yet. It was not the right conversation to do so. I’m confident we’ll have some more encounters and maybe I can get to know her a little bit more. She seems to be a nice person and interested in me. But me? She looks like she can bench press my skinny ass. We’ll see what happens.

      Well it's about 1:30am Tuesday June 15, 2004 and I aint did shit for my 23rd birthday. Monday was such a sucky birthday. I had to work all dam day from 11 to 8pm. I came home and then my friend Josh called telling me about his problems. We talked for over 3 hours. Well he talked I just listened.   On my birthday I’m listening to my friend babble about his life... that sucks man!. What person u know would do that on his or her birthday? And he didn’t even remember my birthday until the end of the conversation...friends!. Well at least I had Shelli to keep me company on cam while I talked to Josh on the phone. And that was pretty much my birthday. Didn’t go anywhere amd didn’t do anything. Didn’t get any presents and no one called me to wish me happy birthday. Oh. Shelli text messaged me and sent me an E-card and I got $50 and a card from my parents. See.... Told u she is the bestest God sister... Other than that...nada. I still have to pay my parents rent for the month so they r going to get all of it back anyways. This is pretty much how it is for my birthdays. A sucky 23rd birthday. Well I have to post this now... Someone is eager to make a comment on it and I’m not going to call names. Good lord. It’s my journal damit! People/person rushing me to put my thought down. Aint that a shame.

      My friend Josh and I go to gym at nights. He drives coz I don’t have a car. Everything was going good until our work ours got mixed up. He’s working in the mornings and gets off in the afternoon and I work in the afternoon and gets off at night. So he works out earlier and so I’m just stuck. I would hate to join a gym and spend $40 a month just to lift some weights. I think I need to hurry my ass up and get a car. Coz I’m 23 and don’t know how to drive... Now that’s sad.  Oh and don’t comment on this!

      How messed up is this? I was on the bus right? The bus driver stopped at a bus top to let someone off. At the same time some guy was hurrying to get to the bus. So the bus driver waited on him. His wife was hurrying to get to the bus also but she was a little behind her husband. The guy stood outside the bus to tell his wife to hurry up. This is all happening within 20 seconds or so. The bus driver was in no rush to go anywhere. The woman is almost at the bus. Then the bus driver counted to 3 out loud and drove off leaving both of them. The bus driver saw her coming. I wanted to say something, but I restrained myself. It was too early for me to deal with someone ignorant like that. Oh did I mention it was hot outside and those 2 people had no shade. The lady was already sweating trying to get to the bus.

      I’m surprised of how many people have a blog in my town. I IMed a few of them just to be like “hey I have a blog too” I bet they think I’m loco. The thing that’s strange about the people who have a blog in my town is more than half of them are Geminis like me. Strange don’t you think? Like us Gemini people aint got nothing better to do. Well maybe it’s because Chapel Hill is a boring place anyway and us, the smart Gemini people that we are know that to keeps us from going crazy out of boredom a blog is the ShiZit!

      I hate my job I love my job. I cant make up my mind. Some times things can go so well at my job that nothing really bothers me except today. We had to feed 300 high school kids all at once which is nothing but when your boss give you a real messed up setup in which to feed them you cant help but to dislike your job or your position. My job has a lack of communication and a lack of consultation. Well at least that’s what I see. How can you run out of hamburgers for 300 football kids? Gees……”football” “kids” what else do you think they are going to eat, rice and vegetables? So the poor kids had to stand there starving, waiting for the cooks to hurry up and make the burgers.  I know how to do almost everything at my job but I choose not to be a supervisor anymore and I don’t want to be a manager because it’s not a good environment to be one. Well at least for the kind of person I am (all around nice guy :) I know how to be a leader and what not, but is the pay really worth me not having good friends and keeping a healthy relationship with my co-workers? I don’t really need the money and plus the managers and the position demands too much of you. I can’t stand fake people who put up a smile and front all the time. It’s enough just being a regular worker/cook, you know? It’s not like my future is at this job. But anyways my point is that someone who was a manager at another store for the same company is now working at our job, he’s cool and what not but he acts like run things but don’t know jack shit about the job. Do I make sense?

      Well I think this is a good idea, to have my thoughts written down somewhere and I have to Give all the credit to my Wonderful God Sister Shelli :). u r an awesome God Sister!!  Today stars a new chapter in my life. I'm trying slowly but surly to change my life for the better. I still do things I should not do and I don't know why I do them but I'm trying not to do it anymore. I need to chance in order for someone to like me. Is that a bad thing? To change for someone else, Well to change ur bad ways.....I don't think so. am I crazy? I also have all these doubts in my mind about things in life. Oh well come what may.

      But anyway I was at the club last night, Avalon. And God dam! I have fun. I danced with this girl all night, sweat so much I had to take my outer shit off. No to brag but I was freaking it and so many girls wanted to dance with me. I didn’t want to dance with them coz the shorty that I was dancing with was so damn good. Talk about some real good bump and grind. WOW! We dance like for a good 2 hours non stop. Till 2:30am. Oh and she looked great. Damn! That’s all I can say. We freaked it so much that everyone was looking at us. The whole 9 yards of freaking boy! I tell ya… Legs over mine, bend over and touch the floor. Everything, you name it we did it. I was even grinding on her. Tonight was off the hook!  My friends, people I don’t even know even my Carolina football friends were giving me pops. After a break from her, like 1 min later some girls just jumped on me. I mean literally jumped on me both legs over me and just start grinding/humping me. Giving her girls props as if I was someone important to bump and grind with. Last night was some crazy shit.  Kids don’t try that at home.  I haven’t dance like that in so long. I think I need to stop after that. Oh and I got her number. And that’s all I have to say about that...  Holla  !

      I think it’s fucked up that it’s a national Holiday for the 4th July, in which America celebrates its Independence Day. Independence comes from the word Independent meaning “  Free from the   influence, guidance, or   control of others  ”. Now if America became independent why did they still have slavery going on? The slaves were not independent in anyway. I understand that the Independence refer mainly to it being no longer a colony of the Europe and so forth. But when they celebrate it, they refer to it as freedom day.  Freedom , should I quote what that word mean? What about the people who were slaves? There weren’t free in anyway or from when the country become independent. Why don’t they have a national holiday to celebrate a freedom day, their Independence Day? So I think that’s fucked up that so many people celebrate such a things.  As a matter of fact most countries that were once colonies of the European world celebrate Independence Day. So once again I really think it’s fucked up coz they all had some kind of slavery going on. And I don’t know of any national holiday which celebrates the freedom or slaves or anything close to it.   I set the comment setting so anyone can comment on anything. So feel free to say what u think about anything on my blog.

       urlLink    This is one of my favorite oil on canvas painting. It can mean lot of things depending on what kind of person you are. To me it�s somewhat of a spiritual painting. In the center of it you can see a white thing, like a person and following that is its shadow. The white frills at the side can mean many things. Once again; everyone sees and feels something different when they look at this painting.

Not what I really wanted but at least I gave it a shot. I tried to have a lot of reflection on the bottle as you can see and I even included a reflection of me drawing the bottle.

Beautiful colors and stuff; One would think I spent forever painting it. But I spent forever pasting it all together. But in the end it came out to be something beautiful.

       urlLink    Pastel is wonderful if you know how to use it. This piece is a simple piece with a lot of meaning behind it. Well at least it has meaning to me. A bold and contour piece brings out the POP art era. With the bright colors you can easily tell what this piece of artwork is all about.

       urlLink    I always like to do some landscape painting every once in a while. At first glance you may think that you know where that place is but in fact that place is in my head. This desert painting came from my imagination. As you can tell its oil on canvas and it makes a remarkable impression whenever you look at it. This tall, clear and blue desert sky brings a calm natural feeling to any room.

       urlLink    I'm pretty sure you can tell what this piece is of. It's a face, a female's face. This is a charcoal piece in which I used a lot of smooth contour lines and some natural earth tone colors. It has some wonderful shading and repetitive curves. The blue green paper makes some of the colors pop out more than others which sometimes catches your eyes and drift your attention away from face.

       urlLink    This is an abstract drawing done with charcoal on paper. It's of a man covering his face. This piece has a lot of smooth contour lines which gives it a crisp clean feeling when you look at it. Some of the lines make it seem as if the person was in motion and in some ways bright this abstract drawing to life.
