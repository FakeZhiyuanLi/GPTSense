      Mozart's active imagination ensured he rarely encountered boredom. Many would be frustrated travelling so much in the days of carts and horses. Wolfgang, at the age of four, created for himself a kingdom, where everything went his way. Everything in this imaginary land caused amusement to its creator. Place names were the names of real towns and cities but their names reversed. London given the new title of Nodnol etc. It's after the infant Mozart's kindom that I name this blog Rucken. The spiel within is of my hand alone unless otherwise stated or quoted from. It willl be at times profound, often amusing and occasionally zany to boot.  Welcome to Rucken.

      My name is Amadeus, born into a musical family my given name has left me with much to live up to. The complicated composer Johannes Chrysothomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart who survived his infancy unlike all but one of his siblings, picked up music very quickly and as you may already know was soon touring Europe with his Father and Sister. With all this performance the ego raged, ever more confident of the talent contained within the mind and body. This man Wolfgang was by the age of 33, the most Famous European Composer amongst his living contemporaries. Whilst Wolfgang should have been rich in wealth he consistantly lived beyond his means. Where he should have had many friends and admirers he instead alienated most potential friends within a few days by way of being too confident and coming over as an arrogant cocky little brat. At the age of 26 it is startling how similarly I have might have fared had I not been able to asses my many faults so early on in life.

      Blog seems too often the case to be another word for 'rant'. I'm not here to exhibit my opinions and judgements for all to see. What you'll find here is a friendly correspondent to whom you can hopefully relate. to whom you can hopefully relate.

      There was a time when everything seemed so simple. We knew where we stood. Life was not so complicated as it is today. Here's what's happening, this is what you can do... "There, do it, off you go now." Easy stuff. As time progresses I see a change, constant change. Not everyone is aware of this. The world slips through the lives, minds and fingers of the unenlightened. For those people choosing to live consciously, we can create our world accourding to our consciousness and view it at our own level. What a wonderful thing the realm of the relative is.

      Good morning/afternoon/evening/night/grief/bye (ignore as applicable) This is the writing of Amadeus Harlequin. I used to be called Hellequin but people misunderstood the name. So form here you can expect to read about the recent experiences of the eternal eye of the world. That is, a view askew to enable you to be... mused. Welcome to my domain, the realm of Rucken.
