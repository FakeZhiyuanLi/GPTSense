      Rightio so after setting this stupid thing up im ready for entry number 2.  During the holidays I went on a 12 day seakayaking/rafting expedition with school.  This was seriously hardcore, we dropped in at a place called farm house creek up on the picton river.  Bloody cold but.  So yea anyway day was spent driving as far in as we could, then we had to get all our gear down to the river, set up camp, inflate the rafts ect.  Most of the 18 of us were under tarps the whole trip, however I took a tent for the first 5 days of the rafting, and ditched it when we got the sea kayaks.  Anyway, so yea we had a quick de-brief that night, where we talked about the leaders for that day, and our goals for the rest of the trip ect.  Day 2 we started rafting, and was one of the biggest days we had.  The water level was high so we had a quick ride.  However we took ages getting ready as it was our first day packin the rafts ect. then we had the safty talk, then we set off, with our eye on tahoon, however that was quite a long way away.... Turned out we were actually able to make it to Tahoon which was great because we were able to sleep in the hut there curtosy of the staff at the airwalk.  Day 3 was epic, we had to find a campsite SOMEWHERE along the river, and the front raft managed to find one by accident which was great. However it had this hugely steep bank to get to the site fromt the river so we had a handline which made for lots of fun....  So yea that was a bit of a weird site, quite cramped, and probably one of the shittest, but hey it didn't stop us.  That arvo we planned a walk down some foresty roads.  Anna, one of our big guides took us to a place which is being reserved which is great.  There were man ferns there like 5 metres high.  Walking back was great there was a huuuge full moon which we all howled at like wolfs, i wont ever forget what happened next.  We saw something I swear happenes once in a very blue moon.  We saw a night time rainbow, I kid u not.  The most amazing thing I have ever seen....  To day 4.  This day we didnt have that far to go, however the river was widning up so the water was moving slower than usual.  We ended up at a place we called Clancy's.  A paddock owned by a friend of Anna's.  On the way however we went up to southwood, a new wood processing plant to be made by the government.  not such a fun thing for anna, the conservationist, but we ended up even getting a tour?!?!  so that was a highlight. then as I said we pushed on to clancy's.  We set up ok, until Matt made us do what he called a "group inititive activity". this involved us setting up the tarps properly basically, so we could have another de-brief of the last few days.  I slept in my tent for the last night, which was warmer I'm sure, because as we awoke on day 5, my god i havn't been that cold ever....  Day 5.  Ok i'm talking serious cold....like u would not believe.  There was snow on low lying surrounding peaks.  Getting into a damp wet suit....my god it makes my spine shiver thinking about it.  neway back to the story, we had to make a place called rannala by 3 o'clock to get our sea kayaks for the next part of our trip.  tho i think ill make that a seperate log.  So yea we got there in good time, after a quick run in with an electic fence.....dont ask.  anyway it was so great to get re-supply.  my 5 day old gurken dip was ready for the bin, and it was so good to get a fresh jumper....my god.  so yea it was nice, new food, rubbish drop, it was like starting over....  we then went into a nearbye paddock to set up one of the sickest tarps in the history of the world.  we lashed paddles together and stuff.  and then piched it against a fence.  that was a good night there, and my first under a tarp which was supprising great.  it wasnt too cold and it ment we had lots of room to move about and things.  so yea we had one more de-breif that night, after cooking up a beautiful meal, and had a good sleep.  ill leave the sea kayaking to the next post.  ....to be continued

      G'day all, I'm Josh, more commonly known as Squish a nickname I aquired  a long time ago from my uncle.  Anyway welcome to my blog....This being  my first post I thought I might share my brief life story with you.  I  was born in Hobart, Tasmania way back in '86.   Until I was 8 I lived  "high on a hill" up on Mt. Nelson, had a brillient childhood and went  to Mt. Nelson Primary school.  Bloody oath that school is tops.   Anyway, we had a good time there, lots of family holidays to Coles Bay  and visits up to the farm, then in 1994 or so we moved to Albion  Heights Drive.  I love my house so much, and we're still there.  I then  went to Friends' High School and now im in Clemes in Grade 12.  I have  my license, and my car, a 1987 Honda Civic, 1.5 L, 5 speed manual.   Little pocket rocket it is too.  Life is good.  Plans at the moment for  the future are as follows:  Finish school, do well, get a score close  to 90.  Then I will be off to England working a GAP year there.  I will  hopefully do this with school and go to another Quaker school outside  of London called Saffron Walden.  If thats not possible, I do have a  interview with GAP this friday, so hopefully one of those will work  out.  After my year away I will be back in Tassie, get my job back or  get another, then start my degree at University studing Agricultural  Science.....after that what will I do.....your guess is good as mine.  Squish
