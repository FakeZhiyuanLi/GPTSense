       We have a sign right next to the debit machine at work that says "NO refunds, exchange ONLY."  That same phrase also appears on the bottom of every receipt we print.  Judging from that, you could safely assume that we don't offer refunds, but exchange only, right?  Tell that to the douchebag who walked in last night.     "Yeah, I bought this movie earlier today, and it's blank.  There's nothing there."   "Oh yeah?" I said.  "Well, I guess you can get another one."   "No, no," he says.  "I want my money back."   "I'm sorry, but we don't do that.  It's exchange only."   "But there's nothing on this tape!"   "It doesn't really matter, we don't give refunds.  There's a sign right there that says so," I said pointing to the debit machine.   "Why do you have such a small sign?  No one can see that!"   The fuck?  "It's right there next to the debit machine," I said.  "It's kinda hard to miss."   He kept arguing, saying that he just bought the tape, and he deserved to get his money back and all the other stores give refunds (bullshit) blah, blah, blah.   "Listen," I said.  "We don't give refunds under any circumstances.  I don't make the rules, that's just the way it is.  You're more than welcome to pick another movie, but that's it."   "Well where's the manager?" he asked.   I love it when these people assume that they're going to get a different responce out of The Boyfriend than they will out of me.  Where the fuck do they think I get my information in the first place?   "He's not here right now," I said.   "Well I know that, duh!  When is he going to be in?"   Ass, ass, ass!  "He'll be in in the morning, but he's going to tell you the exact same thing."   Eventually he moved off into the stacks and started seraching for another video.  He came back to the counter, I made the exchange and he said, "You know there's no need for you to give me all this fucking attitude."   "I'm not the one who started with the attitude, just so you know," I said, but at that point he was already walking out the door, swearing and muttering to himself.     Ass, ASS,  ASS!!

      ...but I've been kinda busy.  I'm sure you can understand! Anyhoo, welcome to the second phase of Tales of Sin, where the tales are still dirty and the author is still full of deep, deep rage!   So here's the latest fiasco.  A few weeks ago, this customer's wife called the store and caught The Boyfriend.  Seems she found her husband's stash 0' porn...only it was a stash o' gay porn.  She kept asking questions about her husband's account, but since her name wasn't listed, there was nothing else The Boyfriend could tell her. A few days later, this woman's husband comes into the location where our general manager works, saying that someone had printed up his rental record record for his wife, and that the someone was me!  This obviously pissed off our gm huge, but I didn't do a thing.  No one has ever come in the store asking me to print up a record, and even if they did, I would never do it.  I know better than that.  That's just the kind of thing that would cost me my job. Thankfully I had The Boyfriend on my side, and while staying completely unbiased, he did all he could to assure our gm that I never did a thing, and in fact, the day this customer claimed I printed out this rental record, I wasn't even there! (It's true.  I was actually in Toronto that day!) The customer wouldn't let it go, and kept saying he had the rental history print-up as proof.   He said he would be back in town on Friday, and would be bringing his "proof" with him.  So for a week, I sat, shitting my pants, scared to death that our gm would believe this customer rather than me and I'd be headed for the cesspool that is the welfare office.  All this time, our gm kept drilling The Boyfriend on what kind of employee I am,  (obviously no one at work knows about us) and as Friday drew closer, the gm seemed to be leaning more towards my side. Friday came, Friday went.  No customer.  No "proof".  No shit.  The Boyfriend's theory is that this was a guy who possibly flirted with me once and I shot him down, or he got caught with all his gay shit by the wife, and simply needed someone to blame.  Lucky me.  Doesn't matter now though.  I still have a job, which means you still have something mildly entertaining to read.  Everybody wins!
