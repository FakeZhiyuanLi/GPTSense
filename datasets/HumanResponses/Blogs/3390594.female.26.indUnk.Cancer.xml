                                                       Heidi Lynn         Cancer..what is it? The devil straight from hell. On Febuary 27th 2003, my life was to change in a way I could never imagine. My mother, My best friend of such a young age of 45 was diagnosed with stage 4 Lung cancer with 13 tumors that spread to her brain.    At first they gave us hope, with treatment 18-24 months to live, without 6 weeks. So... you tell me, which would you choose? You see all these wonderful success stories all over the television, newspapers,internet etc. We all figured what can it hurt if it can increase her life span. Yeah, what a joke!   The first month or two was, well, o.k.. Mom was still pretty active, she'd play with the grandchildren, thank god they came early in her life, or she would have never known the wonderful children they have become. After that the chemotherapy took over my mother. She could not eat without getting sick two minutes later, very weak and tired, and she sat in a recliner almost all day everyday, until the end, what a way to live. Strength and courage, I don't know how she did it, fighting every minute of her life that she did not even now how much of it was left.   She called me in the beginning to make sure I, as the oldest, knew what items were to go to who. She feared that if she did not tell me then she would not remember later. My grandmother was to get a picture with a special saying on the back, just hours after she passes. I said "Mom, why me, I can not deal with you saying this to me, I am not ready for this." How selfish was I? My mother is dying and I am only 25 with a full life ahead of me and all I can say is "I can not deal with it." My mother knew how much I was hurting, I was not only losing my mother , but my best friend. She also knew no matter how much I was hurting I would still do everything she asked.   My mother, I feel was robbed of her life not just by the cancer but the treatment that was to help the cancer. It was her decision no one else's to take the chemo. We stuck by whatever decision she chose. She may have only lived two months verse seven months  without the treatment but, I feel it would have been worth it to live those two months to the fullest extent, enjoying the last of her life. Instead she lived the last five months in misery. She did not know, she just wanted to get better and she sure fought for it.   The time had come. At 6:00 a.m. on September 6, 2003, I got the call, "Hurry, the nurse is here and she says it is getting close", out the door I went. My whole family, grandparents, 2 aunts, 3 uncles, 1 step sister, stepfather, myself and my mother's best friend. We all stayed by her bedside in my grandparents home for 2 days. I held my mother's hand and told her what a wonderful mother she was, how much I love her and it was o.k. to let go, she had fought long enough. She still fought for about 24 hours longer, at exactly 4:22 p.m. on September 7,2003 she finally let go her long battle and god took her into his arms. My mother, my best friend, my hero, what a meritorious person she was and all the wonderful memories I will pass on to my children and their children to cherish forever and eternity.   People always say " Oh, honey, I know it is hard, but it will get easier." What is their definition of easier? The longer time goes on the more I miss her and the harder it gets. So, really, does it get easier or do some people just forget?
