						   Folks, I just wanted to let you know that the best way to waste your time is to do something that isn't useful... but you gotta have lots of fun doing it! Honestly, I've thoroughly enjoyed the time that I've spent on  urlLink The Homestar Runner Website . I've spent hours and hours looking at the  urlLink Strongbad e-mails , and they're pretty hilarious. If you don't know what Homestar Runner is, then when you have free-time, just visit the website. I've watched a few of the toons, too... they're pretty good. Anyways, that's my random rambling about Homestar Runner, I hope you're a happier person for it (under no circumstances are you to ignore your friends just to watch another cartoon... only watch it when you're bored and have nothing to do...). Ok, goodbye. urlLink

						   Children, I just wanted to let you know that I'm back. I'm glad that Kimmy wasn't too drastic about anything. I'm glad you missed me! Anyways, I just wanted to say that I'm back, and I have nothing else to say.

						   Every new day is a gift from God. Many times, I don't realize this, and I treat a new day as an obligation, rather than a gift. If you think of today as a gift, then you will be more likely to enjoy it for what it's worth.

						   Did you know that I just won a free SOBE on Sunday???  It was so awesome!  It said "Look under the cap to see if you have won!"  And guess what!?!?! I won!!!! of course, to get my free one, I have to buy another one. How does that work?  In reality, I actually get two at 50% off! hehe!  I guess I will have one to share with a lovely friend!  maybe I will sell it for profit!  Or I might just give it to my lovely sister, Melissa!  I love you Mel!    Love always,  Kimmy Blunt

						   with Natalia... We do love you, Dan, even though the color is pink...  By the way, is it a fashion for the guys in Brasil to wear pink?  Just wondering...  Well, I had an awesome night!  We all went bowling!  I am really (and I mean   really)    bad at that game!  I have so much fun playing it though!  I think the highest score that I have ever gotten is like a 98!  hehehe!  Oh, well!  I just hope that I will be able to keep my record of never breaking 100! LOL :)  Well, I must be going now!  I need some sleep so I won't be grumpy... hehehe I will talk to you guys later! God bless and G'night!  Love always,  Kimmy Blunt

						   Church camp is less than a week away! I'm excited, but not ready for it! I don't even know if I own enough clothes for that long away... much less have them clean!! But, if you know me, you know that I'm not even bothering to check my clean clothes, because I'm much too lazy for that.  While I'm not on the topic... guys, I don't have very much money. I just thought I'd let you know that.   Oh yeah, I'm hungry...

						   No, I'm not depressed. No, I wasn't fired from a job. No, my best friend didn't leave me. No, I didn't eat a stink bug. No, it's not even the fact that our blog is pink...  None of that! If that happened, I would probably be alright, because things happen. No, today is the worst day of my life, because I am confused as to what day it is. It's bad enough just not knowing, but I can't figure it out whether it's Tuesday, or Wednesday. I wouldn't normally have a problem with this, but some very reliable sources tell me it's Wednesday. Anyways, kk' says it's tuesday, so I think I'll be alright.  I just thought of it, but... is TODAY the worst day of my life? Or is it TOMORROW that's the worst day of my life? Anyways...   ps: I'm not lovin' that whole pink thing...

						   ok, so I'm only joking, but PINK??!?! Seriously, you guys... this is not funny. Just so everyone knows, I had nothing to do with this... I had it a nice green.

Oh, and the color of our page, perfect!  hehehe, we can change it Dan, if you would like us to. :)  So, the title... SOBE yourself... myself I'll be, I'll post on here and laugh with glee!

						   ...sometimes. I love technology, because I can instant message my friends. I love technology because I like to play video games. I love technology because I can send receive pictures with my friends. I love technology because I can e-mail my friends, and receive e-mails from them. I have a web-cam, and I use a microphone to chat.  However, technology seems to not work as much as it should. I might think this because it decides not to work at inopportune times. Well, I guess nothing's perfect, and technology is a great thing... when it works.   That reminds me... I'm hungry...

      I'm not sure what I'm going to write about yet, but I just feel like writing something. If any of you like bacon, you should let me know. Oh yeah, I could talk about bacon. It's one of the most unhealthy things I know... you're basically eating the fat of the pig, yum yum! But... who likes vegetables? Isn't it kind of ironic that the things we should eat, we don't like, but the things that are bad for us, we like? I heard someone say once, "Die young, leave a pretty corpse." Well, that's my random rambling... I'll probably delete it later or something...

      Hey folks, I'm finally back.  This week was an awesome week for pretty much everyone at camp. Everything was so awesome, but I'm also very tired from an exhausting week. I've never seen so many people show up for early prayer... and the services were so awesome because of it.      This week, I've been given a vision for my life. You see, the speaker gave some statistics about Christians, and one of them was that 95% of all Christians will never lead someone to Christ. That really bugged me, because I've never led anyone to Christ. So then, I was just praying the whole week for God to use me to lead others to Him. Then last night (Thursday), when I was praying, I was just asking God all of this stuff, like to give me courage and boldness, and a bunch of other things, and the worship leader came and prayed with me and prayed all of the same stuff that I was praying before!!! It was the most awesome thing ever! Then later in the night, a girl came and was praying for me, and she was just praying for more boldness and courage, and a couple of other things... but it all lined up with what I was praying for!    Anyways, camp was really good, but I'm glad to be home! I've been so exhausted, and I want to go to bed now (in my own bed)... anyways, I'm back, and I like bacon. Goodbye my friends.

      Folks, I'm leaving tomorrow morning for camp, so don't expect to see me online for a while. It shall be sad times to leave all of you, but then you can ponder how much you wish you could talk to me ;) ... or not. Anyways, it shall be joyous times as well, as I'm going to church camp. Also, I get to see a good friend of mine that I never see. Oh yes, Kimmy, I have a gift for you (I hope you like it)...      1 Corintios 13:13    Y ahora permanecen la fe, la esperanza y el amor, estos tres; pero el mayor de ellos es el amor.        Con mucho amor, Dan

      Ok, today is the weirdest day of my life! I think that maybe half of the world went into a time warp, and the other half didn't... I'm scared for my sanity!  Today, the radio station said it's Wednesday, and my brother's clock (which is hooked up by radio to this clock that's supposed to be never wrong) said that it's Wednesday. But I don't remember living tuesday, and my computer says it's tuesday, and my little brother has soccer practice on tuesdays, but not mondays, and there was no soccer practice yesterday, AND all of my previous posts say Monday or sooner! I am going insane! Maybe I'll call my mother...    ps: thanks, Kimmy!

      Good morning people! You may think that's it's after noon, which you would be correct, but it's also morning for me! Today I got to sleep in! It felt so good... and now I have a full night's (er, morning's) rest. I have one friend online so far... and I met one of my other friend's little sister. And that is all I've done today... talked to 2 people (and my little bro at home). Maybe I should finally clean off my bed, since I long to sleep in it once more.  Well, camp is 1 week from today! I'm pretty excited, but I think it'll need to be closer for me to REALLY get excited. I might buy a disposible camera so that I can have some pictures... but I don't know, I'm kind of a cheapskate. I hope the food is good...

      So, I was having this argument with Christy today... and it was about something stupid, of course. And, she decides that she's right (of course...). Anyways, it hit me then, that I will never in my life win an argument with a girl. I will go to my grave without ever being able to say, "I won." I can't win w/ Kimmy, and I can't win w/ Christy (who are the 2 people I argue with the most). SO, I came up with a brilliant plan! I'm gonna go to Wal-mart tomorrow, and argue with someone I don't know! It will, of course, be a girl who I don't measure to be as quick as my friends. "Why a girl?" You might ask. Well, the answer is simple... I've won many arguments with men... that's no feat! I will triumph some female, somewhere! Ok, goodbye.

Yeah, maybe if I was doing something stupid like partying... and had a bunch of friends over, it would've been a blast...  ps: I acted like an idiot in church today... maybe it was the lack of sleep...

      Hey folks... I discovered that I've posted too many things from the same event. The result? Too many things from the same event. What do you know? So, I've decided to take off many of those pictures that I've felt are non-essential. Obviously, if you were on here before, and now wonder where certain pictures have gone... I'm in the process of removing them. This is to provide better customer service and lower prices to our valued customers (blah, blah, blah)...

      Jaime is one of the first people that I met at Internationals, over 2 years ago. He's the reason I know so many awesome Brazilians. Not only that, but he's one of the very most awesome people I know... he's from Paraguay, but he's been in Brazil for a while. Many of you probably know him, and you're better off if you do! Anyways, that's Jaime in a nutshell.  Then there's Natalia... when I first met her... I thought she hated me, and she thought I hated her. It's kinda funny now that we look back... especially how close we've gotten. We are so alike, it's scary! Well, not really scary... but very cool. Like, all the things we think at the same time... and all the stuff that we both like. Anyways, it's like Natalia is another me, only a girl... or maybe I'm another Natalia, only a boy... who knows? But, if you don't know Natalia, you're missing out! (not just because she's similar to me... but because she's a good friend to have)

      This is my friend Brytt... she lives in Boise, and she's one of my good friends... she's always looking forward to camp (which is the only time we ever see each other), so she asks me in September if I'm excited for camp (which is in July)... it's pretty funny. So, guess what? I get to see her this month, 'cause it's July! party!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink
