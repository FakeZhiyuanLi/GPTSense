          Ok, first day back to school since Friday. Well I didn't even go a full day, I had an eye doctor appt. @ 9 so I went to that and got back about 11. So I had a total of 4 periods today. So the day went really fast. I didn't get to go to the career center.   Cassie, I still can't believe that they rescheduled the AC Tournament for next Saturday!! How stupid can they get? I mean how many schools do they expect to show up at this thing? Aren't all the schools doing Solo and Ensemble? I really wanted to do the tournament!! I am so mad!! Sorry, that was my little rant. I am all better now.

          Ok, I like snow days but this is getting rediculous. 3 days of snow days! I getting bored out of my mind. I am not allowed to go anywhere because of the roads, so I am stuck here with my little brother. What fun!! Not!! I don't want to go to school but I don't want the weather to be so bad that I can't get out of the house! I guess that I will have to make the best of it. This kinda reminds me of Quarentine, sorry if misspelled. Have you been working on any other 11/8 songs Matthew?   I guess I will put my TOP 6 Hal McCuen Plays. I have only been on 5 but I saw one so I will add that one.  6: Three Times A Charm, Distime For Sure. Professional time Traveler, who didn't know her lines to save her life.   5: Melissa K. Merdock Will You Please Go Home Now? Cheyenne Wyhoming, girl who love lolliepops so much she had them coming out of her head. I guess it is true what they say, "You are what you eat."  4: Nothing Doesn't Happen in McCuen. Sorry Morgan's mom. Summer Thyme, ditzy wanna be cop. Sorry about the whole, almost falling of the stage thing.  3: Where-Wolf? Tamika, evil fairy  2: Quarentine Mitch, an orphan. And yes all girls have guys names.  1: Moment of Ping. I know that I wasn't in that one but I thought that you guys did a great job. Plus that was the first HMC production I saw.   Well, that is my list, and if you have a problem with it, in the words of Cassie and Heather (who i hear so much about) "build the bloody bridge." Thank you Cassie and Heather.

          Today was a hecktic day. first it was gym. I swear I spraned both of my wrist. Then I got my grade card before 5th period. That was also a depressant. I know it doesn't sound like much but to me it was a bad day. I tried again to see if i was able to get people to post on my blog, but I will see if it works. Bye.

      Thank goodness this week is over!! No more exams!! I got a B on my Health exam, a C on my English exam, a B on my Science exam, an A on my band exam, a F on my Geometry exam, and a 3 1/2 on my Spanish exam. That is just on the oral part, I don't know what I got on the AlphaSmart.   Matthew: I just want to let you know that the play was good. Even though I had to use my script. I almost fell on some step thing. But it was ok, I caught myself. It was a graceful fall. I don't know if Cassie told you this yet or not but I have decided what I want to be in the next Hal McCuen play that Morgan signs up for. If Cassie told you then you don't have to read this but if she didn't then you have to read it. Do you remember the play we did when I was the evil fairy Tamika and that guy came in during the performance and then walked out? Well I have decided that I want to be a person that comes into Don Broyd Hall because I am lost and I need directions. And I get pulled into the story. Cassie will have to tell you all the details but that is my character, sorry about the misspelling.    Cassie: I still can't seem to be able to post comments on your family one but I will try again.

      Ok, today was really bad. I didn't get any studying done for my semster exams and I forgot to bring my oboe home to practice this weekend!! I am so angry with myself. That and Hal McCuen is coming up and I haven't worked on my lines. This weekend has been so stressful. Oh, and Matthew....Yeah. I just can't wait until Spain. A week and a half with no parents in another country. Well I better go study now, bye.

          Hey guys, I know that I said that I have nothing to write about, and that is true but I am really bored so I decided to write. Cassie, did you guys have Hal McCuen Thursday? I was wondering because the 6th of February you said that you hadn't had one because your dad wanted to see if any more people signed up. Well, did anybody else sign up? Well, I better go.

          Ok, sorry I haven't written in a while but I have been busy. Ok that isn't true. I just have nothing to write about. Wait until I get home from Spain, then I will have loads of things to talk about. Only 48 days. B4N

          Ok Matthew I think that you are right about the whole February thing! I hate February!! And thing you said about you are really bored and you want to do something but you are so "blah" that you don't want to do anything. I get that way too. Like right now I feel like that. My brother has a friend over to watch the Super Bowl and I am really bored and want to do something but don't have the energy to do something. February is going to be the longest month for me because of the trip to Spain in March. I just want March to be here already.

          Yeah, my brother is doing the same thing. It is nice not to hear the TV all the time and besides he now has track to occupy some of his time. And Matt you are welcome. You should have been there. Joe House and Libby were conducting us today. Joe conducted us on a piece called "Black Forest" or something like that, and Libby conducted us on "Brookpark" In the middle of Libby's song it changes into 2/2 time about the middle of the song and she didn't know where she was so we started on the 2/2 time and Mr. Taylor had to show her how to conduct in 2/2 time. Well, after she got that down it went back to 4/4 time and while we were trying to play in 4/4 time, she was conducting in 2/2 time still. So we just quit the song and went on to another piece. And Joe is really funny when he conducts. the first time we played it he had his hands down too far and not everyone could see them, so we had to tell him to raise his hands. Well, he said that we needed to lower our stands. And he was biased because he congratulated his own section and no one else but it was okay. All-in-all it was a good rehearsal. And tonight is Family Night. Yeah!! Can't wait. I have to dance and I think I pulled a muscle in my leg so I am screwed. But the dance is really funny to watch. I helped cook during study hall and Senor V. wasn't there to watch the rest of the study hall so Joe Besanson did it. He actually was writing down names for detentions. It was really funny. But cooking was fun, the chicken not so much because of the oil splatter, but other than that it was fun. I also got out of 4th period science too. Well, I think that I have written enough for one day. Actually I think that this is the most I have ever written for any blog ever. B4N

          We are going to STATE!! Yeah!! I can't wait. We just have to find the right weekend when most of the Wind Ensemble can go. We are actually going this year!! I was kind of glad we had a snow day. Even though we have to make it up over the summer, but still.   Cassie, what do you mean it is a NOTSNOW Day? Look at all this snow. I measured the depth of the snow on our picnic table and we had about 1/2 foot, that was during the second big blast of snow. Would you want to get stranded at school because the snow was too bad for the buses to come get us? Not me.  Matthew, You would look better without the beard. I also liked the way you bashed your own section. It was great. Are you back at school already? I couldn't remember.  Oh well. How your having a blast where ever you are.  B4N

          Yes, I am sorry that I haven't checked my blog lately. I have been very busy. And yes I did see that joke on the blog. Very funny. Hahaha. I am totally bummed though. We are leaving for Madrid, Spain in 19 days and so stupid activists in Northern Spain decided to bomb Madrid. We are still going, in case you were wondering, but it still upsets me. Even if I do die I know you guys won't miss me. Yes, Oklahoma was a very good play. I congradulate you on your performance Cassie. And Matthew, I still think you need to shave that beard, you look better without it. Well that was my two-cents on that issue. Well, are you guys happy now that I have checked my blog?

        Hey guys,    I know that it has been a long time since I have written in my blog, but I finally have time to write in it. I got the e-mails that you both sent me. They were a really interesting read. I con't wait until next year. Cassie, do you know what Mrs. Ream is planning on doing next year for the fall play? I wondered because I want to audition. You never did tell me when the Outdoor Theatre was going on at the Richland Acadamy. I hope you guys are having an awesome summer. I am going to North Carolina on the 10th. I can't wait. The whole Winbigler side of the family is going down and we are renting a beach house for the week.   Spain was a lot of fun. I met three girls there. Their names are: Stasie, Aley, and Tiffany. They are from Bakersfield, California. They are going to be Sophomores in Bakersfield Christen High School. The only bad part was when Mrs. Connelly had a allergic reaction to something she ate and she had to go tot the hospital while we were there and we were without a teacher for a while. It was cool though because I hung out with the girls' group. I really didn't Mrs. Connelly that much. Mrs. Connelly and the two women that went with us and I decided that we would go up this mountain on cable cars. Well, I didn't, and probably the other two women didn;t either, but Mrs. Connelly said, after we got onto the cable cars, that she was afraid of heights. Well, after we got up the mountain, we realized that to get to the very top of the mountai, you have to climb stairs. Well, we started walking, now it was just Mrs. Connelly, the two older women and me, the guys decided that they wanted to stay at the beach, and of course all beaches in Europe are clothing optional. Well, about halfway walking up the steps, the two women decided that they would give up and wait for Mrs. Connelly and me. Mrs. Connelly is tough. She climbed that mountain without stopping. It was awesome.   I will have to tell you the rest of my stories of Spain later. B4N

      Okay, now that I have time to tell you about my vacation to North Carolina. I had a miserable time. My cousin and my aunt were complete brats. My aunt wanted to be in charge all the time and my cousin was B.S.ing everything. so, I had a miserable time. B4N.

      I can't believe that they gave your father's job away without telling him and gave it to someone else, but I am glad that he is hopefully moving it the Ashland Arts Center for a cheaper price. I am excited. I really can't write a long one but I will tell you about my trip to North Carolina some other time. Bye.

      Since we're talking of HMC, I decided I'd reflect on times past, and post this list that I compiled back in January. If it makes no sense to you . . . well, it's a Hal McCuen thing; you wouldn't understand. Enjoy the insanity!  TOP TEN HMC PLAYS:  HONORABLE MENTION-"Three Charms a Time, Distime for Sure"-I didn't see it, nor was I in it, obviously. But I have heard about it, and have no doubt that it would be on the list, had I known it better. For one thing, it's got a cool title. For another it involves time travel. A professional time traveler from the future accidentally brings a man from the past to the present, and must find objects from his descendents to send him back. Just one problem: his descendents think he's crazy.  10-"What in the Sam Hill?"-My first HMC production. Samantha Hill, an orphan girl, must escape slavery from the evil sorceress Omnimax, with the help of her friends: Tom Smith, a horribly shy musician who is always humming, Carolina Washington, a somewhat eccentric writer who is always watching, Victor Wilmingberger, a terribly clumsy kid who is always messing up, and . . . a talking dog? What in the Sam Hill . . ?  9-"The Glimmering Moment of Ping"-Tricia McCarry is deeply distressed when her adopted daughter, Portia, returns home to Forrest Falls to stay. She’s trying to run a store here, and it doesn't help that she already has to deal with a pickpocket, an inept bodyguard for the jeweler upstairs, and some strange kid who says he's an 85 year old magician . . . and doesn't look a day over sixteen. And as if that isn't bad enough, we may not necessarily be on earth! It's just a typical day for Tricia McCarry . . . that is, until the glimmering moment of Ping . . .  8-"Melissa K. Murdock, Will you Please Go Home Now?" (apologies to Dr. Suess)-Melissa K. Murdock doesn't want to go home. She wants to learn about people . . . something she can't do when she's cooped up in her rich parents' home. So when she meets four-year-old Cheyenne Wyoming, a typical child with a thing for lollipops, she thinks she's got it made. But that's before she finds out that Cheyenne’s imaginary friend is a real ghost named Jerome . . . or before she meets Rashel, an evil lady . . . with a cape . . . and somehow gets in the middle of an ancient fight between Good and Evil.  7-"Backstreet mystery in Front Street Hotel"-It's amazing where a writer can get his inspiration. Gene Alder, a struggling writer trying to get an idea for a story, decides to stay at the Front Street Hotel for a while, to see if some relaxation will help him think. What he doesn't realize is that he is in the same hotel as well-known detective, Julie Sanders, and she is on the case to find a missing Backstreet Boys shirt. Could it have been stolen, and if so, who could have done it? That little girl Molly has a knack for stealing things she likes . . . but that strange boy Topher is acting very suspicious. Or is the hotel manager having fun with him? But getting clues might be tough. That gossipy receptionist is still on the phone and the claustrophobic clerk is stuck in the elevator . . . sounds like it'd make a good story.  6-"Nothing Doesn't Happen in McCuen " or “Summer’s Winter Fall” or “Josiah’s Thirteenth Adventure” or “Death Gets a Life” or “Kerri’s Delusions of Fiction” or “Secret Service Slippery Slope” or "Do you get the feeling we have way to many titles for this play?" or . . .-It's just another typical winter night in the little town of McCuen. Attorney Josiah Foreman is up late working again, forcing his secretary Amelia to stay with him but he keeps being interrupted by trifling matters. Some girl is stuck on the road and can’t find her twin sister, a very familiar man keeps walking about talking into his watch, Amelia is muttering about seeing Death in the form of their local undertaker, the President of the United States has fallen into a ditch . . . and of course there's Kerri and her delusions of fiction. If she calls him Mr. Butterbur one more time . . . but no time for that. Summer's got her tongue stuck to the flagpole again. Who says nothing happens in a little town?  5-"Triple Crown"-Those jewels on that crown look very authentic for just plastic props . . . but Sebastion Devolski Smythe (called Sir by those who know him, for obvious reasons) soon finds out that they are, in fact, very real jewels, stolen from jeweler Latasha. Now they need to determine who stole them. Could it have been Sir, the grouchy director, to get revenge on Latasha? Could it be actress Hildy, who handles the crown in the play, and could have easily hidden them there? Could it have been Latasha herself, for the compensation she'd get? Or could it have been Juniper, who just likes shiny things? She is, after all, a wood sprite. It's a strange sort of mystery, and Horace Ludwig is on the case. There's just one problem . . . he's a complete moron.   4-"Where Wolf?"-Joanna Kingston and her friends seem normal enough, just sitting in her coffee shop, listening to Louis's tall theatre tales. But reporter Kelly Brown suspects something is up, especially after hearing of some of the strange activities this group engages in . . . whenever the moon is full. There can be no doubt . . . one of them is a werewolf. But which one? Joanna the friendly coffee shop owner, who seems to have many secrets; Dr. Louis Pine--or could that be Lou Pine, Lupine, as in wolf?; Nigel Houston visitor in town, who for some reason shows up once a month; Tamika, who gets upset for no good reason; or Hannah Wallace the owner of the art museum, who seems to be hiding something. Everyone seems to have a secret, leaving us to ask one thing: Where wolf?  3-"Questionability of Doubt"-There's been a lot of computer hackings around recently. But she covers her tracks so well, it’s been difficult to find proof . . . or even who she really is. But it's nothing computer expert and salesman Roger Thompson can't take care of . . . that is until his mother gets involved. But she suspects someone completely different: ex-con Sam White, who she arrested years ago for hacking. He has been acting a tad suspiciously lately . . . could he be up to no good again? And what's with that monkey in that loud shirt? No matter; there's work to be done, and Gertrude will unwittingly enlist the help of Tiana Martensen—who happens to be the same suspect Roger is following--to help her catch Sam and protect her son . . . that is, if she isn't distracted by what people are wearing . . .  2-"Quarantine"-My last play, with arguably the best title. It's another typical day for Dr. Gregg. Gypsy girl needs an allergy prescription, orphan wants to know about her parents, and as usual, there's Lyn, the odd woman who seems to always be watching. But when a runaway girl brings her sick brother to see him, the building must be quarantined. As patient after patient goes to see the doctor, they learn about each other, and about themselves.  And the number 1 HMC play: "The Fourth Wall"-Four women disappear mysteriously from their own times, to find themselves together in a future not to their liking: their beloved town abandoned, except for Daniel, the mysterious caretaker, who must convince them to back and change the paths they are on, or a disastrous future will result. Through the mysterious technology that causes lives to become scripted, and with the help of a mysterious theatre patron from another realm, Daniel must convince a lady to marry, a musician to play, an evangelist to council, and a girl to stay . . . all the while teaching the women about the people they live with and the choices they make . . .  "So, we're not necessarily on earth . . ."

      Hi! This is Cassie, who is now a member of this blog, I guess. I'll post about HMC here so everyone can get upset like I am.  HMC is leaving Dad's direction, at least in Mansfield. Dad is resigning from the Richland Academy, and here's why. Well, this is at least the straw that broke the camel's back.   The Academy got a grant, so they decided to offer HMC for free this summer to bring in new people. About 25 kids signed up. But an age-limit ws put on the class. 8th grade. And someone else is teaching it. And Dad wasn't even told.  Yeah. They just gave his job to someone else without even telling him. He found out through a newspaper article and confronted Mary Ann, because otherwise, he would have come in to teach it without knowing that the job had been given to someone else. So that's the deal with HMC, tarah. You wouldn't have been able to sign up anyway. But dad's gonna try to move it to the Arts' Center in Ashland. We'll probably have to call it something else, but it will still be HMC and it'll be much more affordable at the Arts' Center.   So that's the Deal. And I"m upset, but kinda glad, too. Stupid Powers That Be! GRAWR!

      I bet you are surprised to see that I have posted again so soon. I stillhave loads to tell you about Spain.   There is a really funny story about Kevin and Tom. I think you have heard this story already Cassie, so don't read this.  Well our group was at this castle and the girls and I decided to go up to the top of it. What we didn't realize was that there were stairs that you had to climb up and they were really narrow ones at that. Well while we were doing that the guys from my group decided not to do it and stayed outside. Well Tom and Kevin were talking and Kevin said, "Tom, go suck on that." (He was pointing to a drinking fountain that was outside the castle.) Well, just as he turned around to point a lady walked right by him and he poked the lady in the boob. I wasn't there but just hearing about it was hilarious. He tried to say he was sorry. He said it in English and in Spanish. He said that he still wasn't sure if she understood him but it was so funny. Well, that is my story for today. I will tell you more later. B4N
