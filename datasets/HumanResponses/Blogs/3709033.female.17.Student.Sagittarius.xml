      i spoke briefly with my father last night after arriving back in richmond.  he sounded really fucking sedated and out of it, told me he loved me and that he was glad i was back safely.  needless to say, i was completely confused, as he mentioned nothing of forcing me to come home or killing my boyfriend.  so he doesnt call me this morning, i talk to trevor, who tells me, much to my relief, that dad is not planning on pressing charges against elijah.  i breathe deeply and relax and feel happy.  then, "dad said hes coming to get you tomorrow.  he says youre going to southwest next year."  bam.  i immediently start telling my brother to talk to my father to say anything to get that ridiculous shit out of his head, because honestly if hes going to make me stay in tazewell ill just leave when i turn 18.  so trevor talks dad into reducing my sentence to coming home until august.  fuck that.  if i do that i will recieve an f in my class, completely screwing my gpa.  it would also take away my scholarship (which is for my current business major, but what do they know) and just really, really suck in general.  its not that i dont feel there should be any repercussions for worrying my dad like that, but thats really harsh.  im living away from home now, and i feel that as long as i attend class and do well, what i do should be at my descretion.  sending me home for doing something you dont agree with is complete bullshit.  my mother called elijah and left him a very concise voice mail.  "i hope youre on the run because your ass is mine."  what the fuck.  i am seriously in complete and utter disbelief.  my mother doesnt call me.  she makes up excuses not to come see me.  when i visited her she threw stuff at me and told me to get the fuck out.  when i call her she yells at me about crazy things.  and all of a sudden she thinks shes going to have some say in my life?  i seriously cant believe she has the nerve to do that.  she doesnt even act like im her daughter.  so that gets anyone whos interested up to speed on my life at the moment...im supposed to be writing an english paper but im going to wait until i talk to dad to do so...if i really have to go home tomorrow then what the fuck is the point right?  im going to call dad sometime later today and try to talk with him logically, and remind him that im a person.  for now im reading timequake and drinking smart water.  also before i go i would like to comment on the massive amounts of apathy in the vcu police or whatever system.  dad told me that i was officially a missing person on campus, danielle told me someone had come up and asked for pictures of me, and the people at the front desk were supposed to be watching for me.  so far the only thing thats happened is that ive found a note in my mailbox that says "call your father".  yay vcu.

      so first the good.    i stayed with elijah from wednesday through a few short hours ago (monday night.)  it was fantastic.  we layed around together and ate and watched movies and did all of our super secret lazy stuff that is indescribibly(?) fun and exclusively ours.  seriously one of the best weeks of my life.    now the bad.  i am officially a missing person.  as badass as that initially sounds, it ultimately means that i have been ripped from my mini vacation a full 24 hours earlier than was planned, and that i am in some (how do i italicize here?) serious shit with my father.  me and elijah are lying in bed, ive just gotten out of the shower, we are laughing and admittedly making love.  the phone rings.  we never answer the phone, but for some reason elijah pauses to pick it up.  its my dad.  he asks if he knows where i am, blah blah blah, elijah tells him that i am there, tries to talk rationally to him, of course failing miserably because who the fuck can have a rational conversation with my dad, especially when hes crazy pissed?  dad asks to talk to me, he says random shit like how im in so much trouble, how elijah is going to be arrested, blah blah blah.  i go with my initial anger and tell him that if he goes through with that i will not speak to him ever again once i turn 18.  he says he doesnt give a shit.  pause.  how irrational is that?  whats the fucking point of punishing both of us if im just going to leave as soon as i can? i think its absolute bullshit that instead of trying to be understanding and comprehending that i love someone and i wasnt doing anything wrong he just wants to cause as much damage as possible.  i told him over and over that i told elijah i was 18, that he had no idea i was a minor, it did nothing.  he promised to press charges and essentially try to fuck over my boyfriend as much as he possibly could.  thats not love.  thats trying to make a point and make yourself look strong.  such bullshit.  so yeah ill probably be back in tazewell tomorrowish.  i probably wont be going to college in the fall.  my dad is allowing his relationship with me to be completely fucked by something i dont even think is wrong.  i probably wont see elijah for five months.  i can work a lot and save up money to leave as soon as possible.  honestly, i dont want to do that.  i want my dad to calm down, to talk with me rationally, and for him to meet my boyfriend, the person that im absolutely in love with, and see why i feel that way.  i want everything to be okay and i dont want to have broken relationships with both of my parents.  im so tired of everything and i really REALLY love and miss and need you guys more than i can say.  please love me and stay my friend.  so i dont have a point or anything, im just scared out of my mind, if elijah has to go to jail or some shit i will feel worse than ive ever felt in my entire life.  just once please let something good happen.

      so i have again spent most of my day sitting at my computer desk staring at the tree outside my window.  just so you know, its not a particularly attractive tree.  honestly i dont feel like i have much to say; i spent a good two and a half hours sitting in a coffee shop writing today, so im a bit drained.  i did manage to get the majority of my paper done, and am slightly comfortable with it.  tomorrow im visiting elijah, a day earlier than we had planned, and that's pretty sweet.  i need to do laundry.  tomorrow i need to get a book for my bus ride to dc.  i had a falafel burger today and it was really awesome and im still really full.  this morning i had a honeybun.  =(  i really enjoy sitting outside my dorm at night because all the foreign kids are out there talking and laughing a lot and the girls are really, really fucking beautiful.  me and elijah are trying to figure out this whole greyhound thing, and its proving to be really complex thus far.  but i love him.  =)  even when he makes fun of me.  so um yeah i guess that about wraps up my day...i feel super slackerish for not finishing up my paper now when i have to luxury of the tv not being on, but ive just been sitting here furrowing my eyebrows and chewing on my lip.  i talked to my mother last night and she dropped out of her classes because she is "planning on having knee surgery sometime."  shes not signing up for fall classes either.  i love her so much it hurts so bad to know that i cant try to help her without looking like an asshole.  anyways, we talked for a few minutes pretty normally, then she started accusing me of leaving my windows open in the house so someone could get in (she changed the locks on the doors) which really pissed me off, so we ended yet another conversation on horrible terms.  i told her to call me when she felt like it, and i know she wont, and i know ill call her again soon and well argue about stupid shit again.  enough of this, time to go sit outside i think.

      when i was purchasing my daily ukrops salad today my total was $4.38 and i gave the cashier five dollars.  she gave me back one dollar and 62 cents in change.  i noticed her mistake as i was walking away and felt terrible but didnt go back.  therefore i feel that the vending machine stealing my dollar was a completely justified act and im very sorry ukrops cashier.  :(

      my roommate watches nothing but bet (or black entertainment television, in laymens terms) and laughs incredibly loudly, while exclaiming to herself how funny it is.  with that aside, i plan to blame my lack of thought consistency/coherency on what i will refer henceforth as my "working enviroment."   so after my combination smoke break/homeless people viewing i went inside my dorm and said "hhhmmmm, i would enjoy a refreshing snack from the vending machine."  this thought caused a chain reaction, which ultimately ended with me putting a dollar into the aforementioned vending machine, and carefully selecting a honeybun.  i oh so carefully push the button combination "c7" and stand back, waiting for my beloved honeybun to drop into the thing that i would typically pull it out of.  what happens?  nothing.  the vending machine took my dollar, and more importantly, a little piece of my heart.  i attempted to have a conversation about religion with a muslim boy in my class today, but it was quickly foiled by our inability to fully understand what the other was saying.  cruel, cruel fate.  my roommate is currently complaining loudly to herself about...something.  just for clarity, i have absolutely no problem with my roommate, in fact, i really enjoy her, but she really makes me laugh.  so me and elijah are in bethesda in some bookstore the other day, and during the process of walking out, we, unbeknownst to me, lose each other.  so i attempt to grab "elijah's" hand, and he resists me.  i look over, slightly confused and a little less slightly hurt, and notice that i am attempting to intertwine my fingers with an older man wearing a green shirt and sunglasses.  he looks very, very uncomfortable with this arrangement.  oops.  im wearing a green hoodie that says "here comes a special boy" at the moment, and have been doing so all day.  i looked in the mirror a few minutes ago and noticed that i look rather androgenous today, which of course prompted me to wonder if people thought i really was a special boy.  who knows?  after watching a few episodes of arrested development, i have become curious about frozen bananas.  as a food.  my boyfriend is cuter than yours.  a possible exception may occur if you happen to be the girlfriend of johnny depp, and happen to be reading my blog, in which case we tie.  crystal is blad and ema doesnt have breast cancer.

      so its semi recently come to my attention that people i know actually read this thing.  that makes me kind of nervous.  =(  but im a trooper, so uh, ill keep on writing.  im eating cocoa pebbles.  my second bowl in ten minutes.  mmmmmmmm cereal why are you so good?!  so since returning to tazewell ive gotten back into the swing of things, more or less.  lots of hanging out with ema, crystal, and ema AND crystal.  ive also spent a fair amount of time with my brother, and with my dad.  trevors girlfriend broke up with him by not talking to him for like two weeks...im really pissed at her, mostly because i didnt like her much in the first place.  im starting to think that dad wouldve found some reason to make me come home even if the whole elijah fiasco hadnt happened.  hes been incredibly nice to me since ive returned; he even invited me to go to mexico with him for an oh so classic midlife crisis trip. then theres mom.  last night dad was out of town, so it was assumed that i would stay at her place for the night.  i was out all day at hungrymother park with ema and crystal (more on that later) and got home at about 10 to discover that my mother was "not in the condition to drive" and that she was really pissed at me for being out all day without first letting her know.  i talked to her on the phone, and she seemed really pissed, so i decided to stay at dads place for the night to avoid conflict with her.  so i take my brother up to her house, and crystals in the car with me.  i go inside to inform her that im not going to stay with her, so she attempts to lock me in the house and tell me that im absolutely  not going anywhere.  this prompts me to get really angry, because my mother hasnt had any part in raising me for at least the last four years, so i asked her why the fuck it was her concern, unlocked the door, and left.  =/  i was planning on going to attempt to reconcile with her today, but when i got there her sister was visiting, so i didnt go in.   uuummm crystal/ema/me went to the track today and jump roped/ran/swang/rolled down hills.  it was really fun.  its so crazy that in about a month we're going to be apart.  =/  i suppose ill have to save my hungrymother park story for another day, because elijahs calling me in about ten minutes (supposedly) and i am probably not very good at talking on the phone/writing stories.  ooohhh before i go-hes coming to visit the 22-27th, so if anyone wants they can hang out with us!  wooooooo we are the coolest people ever, i promise.

      so im back in tazewell now.  i got here on wednesday, and since then ive really just been hanging out with crystal/eating/watching tv.  ive rediscovered my love for roseanne and the golden girls.  so i visited my mother on wednesday  night, and got a rather different greeting than i expected.  she hugged me and immediently asked when elijah was coming to meet her.  uuhhh...not what i was bracing myself for.  not to say that she was friendly, she seemed more enthused about meeting my boyfriend then she did about seeing me.  speaking of that, elijah is coming sometime around the 23rd or 24th (his birthday is the 24th) and im going to throw him a party.  =)  a "party" in this context means probably crystal, ema, my mother, myself, and elijah.  maybe trevor and morgan.  but who cares?  i just want to see my mango knees and hold him and kiss him.  =)  so i really miss ema, she will be back tomorrow i think?  that crazy girl.  okay i have really bad cramps and am really pmsy, so im going to go eat (even though i just ate like six pieces of pizza, four breadsticks, a salad, and three cinnamon rolls...okay, no like, thats what i ate) some...something.  oh, im going to watch fireworks tonight even though im really unexcited about it.  i need to find a thermos because i want to take chamomile tea with me.  it makes my cramps not so ouchy.  oh, on another note...so im really considering going to vcu for a semester, then taking some time off.  think about THAT.
