						   havnt really posted anything in awhile. so i thought i would. went bridie o'rileys saturday night and i had a ball danced for e hours straighht pretty sure that i lost weight from it and my feet were burning by the end so im sure i had fun. unable too pick up guys due too the amount of losers around us i swear must have been looser guy night ok too be fare not all of them were. why is it that guys will eye you but make no further moves are they expecting us to make the moves i dont give off a snob image i hope all i do is shake my booty and go nuts on the dance floor. right now im trying to find ways to improve my job interviews some questions are really difficult but i guess may be because i am a recent graduate. well hi ted if your reading this im killing time till you back online so you can call kisses

						   as i sit here munching on  crunchie flavoured ice cream thoughts stumble through my head  often differeing in subjects.  often thoughts about life and living. Too live ones life is coragous and admirable, i pity the souls who make plans yet do not  carry these adventuras plans out. Too live life what does too live life mean  to an individual.... does it involve going from day to day performing meaningless taske, to stay within ones comfort zone? or may it mean too take risks too never remain in that comfort zone. i as an indvidual believe to live ones life is too experience every waking moment as if its the last This involves risks taken  to have bad and good experiences, the good will always overide the bad experiences   hey ted just thinking....how was your sleep?

						   ok this is my first time posting one of these things. Monday i plan to edit my poems and send them into australian poetry compititions for the first time im excited bout this, should be the first start i make to a writing career, whilst applying for scientific positions. i really hope i get myself one of teh forensic positions i have applied for i have been working towards it for so long. Hi ted if you read this post. i just want to say to you that i feel exactly the same way you do, life is definietly cruel sometimes you find someone you would have the best relationship with and friendship just the best everything and the one drawback is you live in anothe country. maybe you will get to visit in april with your internship i would love it. anywho ciao

						   hey hunting for private labs found one to send in to the others all have mutual connections with universities and hospitals but still thinking bout sending a job enquiry anyway. i think ted is turning me into a geek im actually wanting to write in this thing (geek=good though not sure bout me but it looks good on ted he makes it look adorable) must be part of his 'master plan' lol anywho, i just wish i can get a job right now im terribly impaitient with these things. its difficult when its a specialist industry. but im never giving up the good thing bout being ambitious i want a career i shall have one, no matter how long it takes to get it started. you know i think ted is the only one who reads my posts. only one person (but he is important special so thats ok). dancing is going well started to learn a street latin routine for my gold street, its a lot of fun get to show off even more :) im pretty sure the girls will be dizy by  the end though. you know the guys dont have to do as much as the girls i think guys should do some spot turns and bit of american spins to lol. funny in general when doing a basic progressive jive on the second one my teacher gets everyone to swap over so the guys have to spin and do the girls part and they really have trouble spinning its very funny to watch. also when a guy tries to move his hips for the first time it looks really wrong. but you know what they say bout people who can shake their hips oh yeah! lol kisses to ted if his reading
