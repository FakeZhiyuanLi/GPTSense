      As if I don't have enough online journal type things but hey, why not, let's throw one more into the moshpit!! :) I think the hardest thing about this was choosing the layout but this one matches my underwear...erm..too much information? Sowwy..hehe.anyway, I liked this one the most so yeah *shifts eyes* Lets hope this one lasts longer than my Livejournal that I never update...I know, you probably all forgot I had one! Me too! haha. Okays, my throat hurts.  I just shared food with my dog, I haven't done that since I was 10, maybe naiive 10-year-olds are immune to dog transmitted diseases because they don't believe in them, apparently, 16-year-olds aren't.  *sigh* It's okay, I'll get better...eventually.

      Well, it seems Albert's a lazy bum who would rather sleep than hang out with moi haha.  Well, his loss. Then there's Anna, she's going to see Spiderman, then Amy- dinner, Pauline-out who knows where, Jeana- isn't allowed, FRANK- plans, Paul- to chicken to call and I'm afraid  something  cough cough, might happen.  KAREN [yeah that desperate]- at work.  *sigh*   Well, that's okay!  I can stay home, really, it's alright, it's actually better, some alone time with my thoughts...right?  RIGHT?!  Okay, don't panic, Apryl, it's  okay , you still have friends, you still have a life, they're just busy, honest.  Anyway, I can't go out tonight I have to be home so I can call a certain someone later on.  Right, okay, I feel much better now. LOL.  But I better have something to do tomorrow lol.  Oh yea I gotta go to work, well thats settled.  *sigh* No need to worry, I can have tons of fun tonight watching movies and staying online!! WOO! Internet! I'm saving this survey I stole from Amy I'll do it around 9:00 I'm thinking about just disregarding my online journals and devoting my time to this one, because its so friggin awesome!  Only thing is, there's no friends list :( Oh well! I feel better now, I'm gonna go play online games :)  Apryl

      This week=wonderful. Man, I'm really happy.  I know, its lame and all but I am.  It was such a good week and last night something awesomely wonderful that made me very happy happened: Last night 10:30ish pm. *phone rings*   Dad: "Hello?"  pause...  Apryl turns on TV getting ready to watch a movie [Hope Springs, it was cute a new kind of refreshing RomCom] Dad: "Apryl, phone." So it's Albert (and Priscilla on the upstairs phone) so we're talking or whatever and then... Albert: "Remeber that kid Anthony from the beach?" Priscilla: "Oooo" Me: "Yea..." (I think he's waay cute but Priscilla's cousin liked him so the only reasno I got his phone number was to give to her which I did...) Priscilla: "He likes you!" Albert: "you gotta call him" Me: "NOOOOOOO! I can't!!" Well, we talked about how it was just wrong for me to do that because Joanna, Priscilla's cousin liked him and I couldn't do taht and then Priscilla: "Oh please, she already has a boyfriend and she's 14!" Me: "Well.." Priscilla: "And she's moving, and you met her like once you're not even that good of friends, and you like him!" Albert: "And he wants you to clal him. Tonight." Okay, pause!  I really think this guy is waay cute and sweet and totally all that not even like hot or whatever he's just a totally great guy.  Now, everything Priscilla's saying is very true and he called Albert, and asked him to tell me to call him...so... 10 minutes later I'm talking to Anthony on the phone and he said something about how he got Albert's number and called him and asked how I was and stuff.  We talked from 10:40ish till almost 1am but I had to go because I had to go running this morning, luckily both Pauline and I both overslept though and I got to sleep for 12 hours and I'll just go running tonight.  *sigh* I dunno, I hope, maybe, it's possible right?  He's sooo nice, I just shouldn't get my hopes up though.  The higher they get the harder it hits the ground when they fall. I promised him I'd call him agian tonight, maybe I shouldn't have said I'd call him the next day, what if we don't have anything left to talk about and he thinks I'm boring?  Or he thinks I'm just an idiot or something.  Nobody ever actually liked me when I liked them back or just liked me period really and it worked out, but he's 17 and I'm 16 and its like perfect lol.  I dunno, I'm still just really happy.

      Found this in bad things to do/think when you're on a diet: Fat people don't deserve to eat. Do you forego the office pizza because you're afraid people will think you shouldn't be eating? Seeing yourself through others' eyes in a harsh, critical way "is a surefire way to blow a weight-loss plan," says psychologist Debra Mandel of Los Angeles, author of Healing the Sensitive Heart (Adams Media Corporation, 2003). Instead, she suggests, it's more effective to focus on developing a more loving relationship with your body. A study published in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine (Winter 1998) found that those who started out accepting their bodies were more than twice as likely to lose weight as those who felt dissatisfied or ashamed. Oops...I've done that.  Oh well. So I went to see Spiderman today [I'm taller than James Franco?] and there was this kid sitting behidn us and when Spiderman was on this train and there was an overpass he was gonna bump into the kid yells "Watch out Spiderman!" it was sooo cute Haha. What else? Oh yeah! I think I got sunburn! My first sunburn at age 16...that's pathetic. Like I've been living in Alaska forever or something.  Haha.  Man it's been such a fun week, Pauline and I started running and I'm feeling kinda good...not so good- I really shuld eat healthier, I want to be like what's the word...skinny.  Haha.  *sigh* Anyway, I'm still happy...there was this scary gay guy at the beach though, man he creeped me out! Okay, I'm lazy so I'm just pasting my telling Anna the story: MsFeathersMcGraw: so my friend Joanna and I were waiting for the guys to finish changing and we sit down on this bench  MsFeathersMcGraw: and theres this creepy guy like sitting across from us and he goes to her all scary pedaphile like, "I just looove your shorts they're like super delicious"  MsFeathersMcGraw: and so I'm just like emm...ok... (praying for the guys to get their butts out of the bathroom) and he keeps talking to her like, we should trade and saying all this weird stuff  MsFeathersMcGraw: and he's like, what's wrong with your friend?  She doesn't talk much and Joanna is like, oh she's just shy the guy was definitely high or something cuz he just laughed and laughed  MsFeathersMcGraw: and was like, I can fix that we were just like EWWW!  Orli K789ET: hahaha  MsFeathersMcGraw: so finalyl one of the guys get out of the bathroom and he's kinda big and I'm just like hey! there you are!  Sit down!!! And I like dragged him down next to us and so then the guy just like makes this face and starts yelling at me  MsFeathersMcGraw: and he's like, you know missy I don't know why you're being such a bitch let me tell you something, I'm gay and I can be a bigger bitch than you  MsFeathersMcGraw: and he's like, I own this boardwalk and I don't want you on my beach so go get off my boardwalk, go go  MsFeathersMcGraw: and I'm just like wtf?  and my friend is like wat the hell is going on?? So Joanna's like no she's my friend or whatever and he's like, you can stay, but not her and these security gaurds are RIGHT THERE and he starts takling about getting me arrested and guys in tight shorts with boners and they don't do anything it was so messed up  Orli K789ET: lol  MsFeathersMcGraw: then Anthony comes out of the bathroom and I'm just like, Okay guys let's go and I go over to Anthony and put my arm around him lol and so we're walking away MsFeathersMcGraw: and he's like Buh~bye, go go away bye Joanna, nice meeting you, yuo're beautiful and he turns to me nad he's like, you make yourself look ugly MsFeathersMcGraw: I was like wtf? Orli K789ET: omg  Orli K789ET: idiot  MsFeathersMcGraw: and Anthony FLIPPED OUT  MsFeathersMcGraw: and he was like ready to beat the shit out of the guy and I had to beg him with tears in my eyse to just leave him alone to get him to listen to me it was crazy *shudder* So yeah, anyways... I finished reading this book Confessions of A Shopaholic it's actually really cute tehre's this quote from it that describes me perfectly it's in my profile: "In spite of me a part of me starts wondering if maybe Elly's right and I'm wrong... I'm missing the gene which makes you grow up and buy a flat...and start visiting Homebase on the weekend.  Everyone's moving no without me, into a world I don't understand." That's honestly how I feel at times.  Like, everyone is just in the real world and I'm trapped in this surreal little dillusion of what I think life is and in reality it's nothing like that.  I dunno...I'm crazy. Well, I dunno, I'm happy with the way I am I just feel like nbody else is.  Maybe that stupid gay guy was right and I do make myself ugly, everyone else must think so.  It drives me crazy seriously, why did Albert reject me?  I mean, I can understand, he just doesn't like me, but he told me he liked me...it doesn't make sense, he was just being nice?  He must think I'm crazy and if he hurt me I would do something stupid.  Robert got pissed at him at the beach yesterday, he was just like, look at her she's so beautiful you're a moron Albert and then he just walked away and Albert and I were like huh? but now I realize what he was talking about.  I dunno, its getting kinda depressing, all this rejection.  For once can I just be with a nice guy I like???? There are so many people in this world that have wonderful, beautiful relationships or even just someone there for them that they're there for too and have fun with and me...I have nobody. I always get rejected and I don't understand why.  There's seriously something wrong with me...I dunno, whatever, it doesn't matter, I'd rather have everyone in the world be with someone and happy if it meant I;d be the only one left to be alone in the world.

      ::sigh:: my mother over reacts for everything… anyway! I mowed the lawn today, I desperately needed the money and we all know it.  I actually cried over the state my nails were in after mowing the lawn and weeding the garden and the saddest part of it all is that after mowing the lawn and weeding the garden, I still don’t even have enough money to spare to get my nails done!! Oh this is gonna be a most miserable summer for me.  I can manage though, and soon I’ll be done with it all and have my car!  That’s all that really matters, and it’s not even that, it’s just proving to myself that I actually can have self-control and handle my money and save it to buy a car, I pay for will be so satisfying and wonderful.   I have to wonder why it is that the only time I think of wonderful ideas is when I can’t do anything about them.  Ew, my family sucks so much.  Honestly, someone kidnap me please!!! I don’t even care if you leave me at the stateborder as long as I have food I’ll manage, sincerely.  Hehe.  But that’s okay. I have to go to work anyway [money!] Sigh, I’m pooped, it’s gonna be a looong week, I have lots of stuff to do.

      Deedaa, hehe. Tonight was good. I eat, a lot. It's definitely Albertness rubbing off though because I started doing the same type of crunches and stuff he does at night, now I'm always hungry! But my weight hasn't changed! Just like him!  ...either that or it's gonna catch up with me tomorrow! Hmm..just found this thing the doctor gave me, I was supposed to go take blood tests in November...oh well! Lalala, nothin left to write, my dad is mad AGAIN, dam he's got problems!!

      Hmm..I was being so good and eating all healthy and today I totally just didn't.  *sigh* It's okay.  I don't mind so much anymore, even though I know I say that now but will be really depressed and upset about it later. Eh, no biggie. I can't believe how tired I am.  So sleep-deprived its ridiculous but instead of going to take a nap like I plan on doing I'm definitely gonna end up reading this book:  Confessions of a Shopaholic  and hula-hooping for hours on end.  I just realized the html for this is different then Deadjournal.  I never know when to use then or than...I should figure that out. Checking cars...! Woot!  Need money, need car, need boy.  Hehe, sounds like a wanted ad except super shallow and April-fied.   My dad still hates me and it's starting to piss me off.  Nobody can just accept that I'm that stupid one who actually failed subjects, like it doesn't make me any less their daughter you know? Well, live and let live.  I can't control them just like they can't control me no matter how much they think they can. Spiderman 2 on Wed!!! YAY!

      Karen adn I went to the  mall today and we went kinda fast and it was at like 10:30 when the mall had jsut opened so we were coming back and some lady had just blocked in Karen's car because she decided not to take the space only 2 cars down.  So Karen looks and sees this car there and she's like, "HEY! Hey you! Move your car you poopie head!" And lady who's car it was was right there! And heard her and she just ran to her car and drove away Karen and I were just in the parking lot laughing hysterically, oh man, it was a classic. Anyway, I called Anthony last night, it was good to talk to him even though we already talk every single night.  I miss him a lot.  I'm not going to see him until Saturday......sooo long.  That's a whole..2 DAYS! And I can't call him on the phone tonight because we talk way to long and neither of us get any sleep. :( So today will be a lonely day and I'll be thinking about him non-stop but I still think he's great and I know that he's thinking about me too so it's okay if I can't see him until Saturday.   I liked talking to him on thephone with Albert because I saw his joking around with pals side, I like that too.  I like everything about him...:) hehe..I'm so silly. I don't know what he sees in me but I'm glad he sees it because I haven't been happy in such a long time and now I can't even get sad!  It's so great... So great! WOOOOOOOOO!!

      I'm sorta happy because I just realized that it costs $9.98 for a round trip off-peak ticket from Lynbrook to Woodside which is basically what I get a week for mowing the lawn so I can go see Anthony at least once a week if I really  really  want/need to.   Then it gets confusing: Peak - Weekday trains arriving in New York City between 6 AM - 10 AM or departing New York City between 4 PM - 8 PM. Senior/Disabled tickets not valid during AM peak periods. Okay the way I see it, I have summer school and garbage always until at least 12 so I'll always be arriving in NYC after 10am so I don't have to worry about that.  Then maybe sometimes I'll be departing between 4-8 since my mom has this curfew Queens at night is dangerous thing, she's kinda right and I wanna make her hapyp so okay!  That means for a ticket with a round trip off peak/peak combo it costs: $12.35 and sometimes if I do my mom's garden work she'll give me $5 so $15 a week and I can use it to go see him. :) Also, you can drive in Queens when you get your license so I'm really looking forward to that. And now, I gotta go make some money. :)  Apryl

      Today was all church like and stuff, not too bad.  I had like 5 brownies! Haha, oh well.  I didn't gain any weight so that's good, I'm sure it will all catch up tomorrow, luckily kissing burns up to 600 calories and I see Anthony tomorrow ;) hehe. I'm so dumb. But I really do miss him again already.  I talked to him last night but we didn't really get to talk too much it made me sad.  3 1/2 hours till I get to call.  I think I'll stay online for a little, you know, browse around...then I'll do all those crunches I missed this past week (I was a bad girl) and take a shower.  That should be time enough. I finished reading Angela's Ashes, it was pretty good, I dunno why he had to do it with some hoe right before the end of the book though.  It wasn't until I was somewhere between chapters 9 and 11 that I realized the book is written by Frank McCourt himself.  That's kinda funny...ahh, someone stole my away message, I totally just got side-tracked from what I was gonna say.  *shrug* So I'm excited about this movie tomorrow.  I dunno why Rob keeps getting so mad at me for no reason.  It's starting to really bother me though. I'm seriously not even going to talk to him anymore because I hate him being so mad at me, I really didn't even do anything wrong. Grrr... >regretting brownies Serves me right. Well, I'll go browse around the web now...does anyone even read this? I doubt it.
