       urlLink    Double Printing. These are obviously 2 different negatives. I took the picture of the tree by the other one (by the gas station), and the water rings by the grocery store. I was the first of all the classes to attempt this project, and it worked on my first try.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Kid on Merry-Go-Round. I was in Balboa Park when I came to the carousel. I was going to take a picture of just the horse, but then the kid got on...so I took the picture of him too. I got this into 2 art shows; one at my school and one at the mall...It didn't win anything, but it was there. I thought that was pretty cool.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This picture doesn't look quite right to me, something about the way the light was shining on the lilly pads, or the focusing. I like it that way though... I'm not sure why. This was taken by the botanical gardens in Balboa Park. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Here's another one of those cloud shots I took in Mexico that I never posted. It was very difficult choosing a picture to put up for this challenge because I do like taking pictures of clouds so I have quite a few. I'm not sure if this is my favorite, but it shows the clouds and the sunbeams and the focus is on the water so...I dunno, I just like it. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    I chose a more current picture for this week's challenge than I had originally. I took this on tuesday at sunset down in Rosarito Mexico on the little private beach down there. My friend, Brittany,  and I were the only people on the beach because everyone else had left. It was such a beautiful sunset! urlLink

       urlLink    This is a picture I took one night out of the car window when I was on my way back from Charley's (a fast food place...the best around...that serves burgers and fries, that is). I was tring to get the moon and the new freeway...and I guess it worked. It's an okay picture.&nbsp; urlLink
