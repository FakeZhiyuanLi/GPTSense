      **My neighbor was bitten by a stray rabid dog. I went to see how he was and found him writing frantically on a piece of paper. I told him rabies could be cured and he didn't have to worry about a will. He said, "Will? What will? I'm making a list of the people I want to bite!"   **How to be healthly insane *In the memo field of all your checks, write "For Sexual Favors"  *Tell your children over dinner. "Due to the economy, we are going to have to let one of you go."   i might add on to it later.. but i'm too lazy right now..

      Last night i babysat 4 kids for 4 hours.. and what do i get? 10 dollars.. yes that's what i said.. 10 friggin dollars.. is that a rip off or what? lol it was kinda funny though because in order to get them to bed i made them listen to classical music.. it was great fun.. but as soon as the music started they complained that they didn't like that kind of music.. and then they started talking even more! pullin my hair out here! lol. and omg.. i couldn't find my little cousin Brianna or my other little cousin Calvin.. and i found out they were in the shower. together. and Calvin didn't have his pants on. yeah. and they're like 5 and 6 years old here. yeah. anyways.. Andy(13) and Calvin have this mini mini crotchrocket it's so cute.. Calvin looks adorable while he's riding it because he has this little racing helmet that goes with it... so adorable. oh and last night i found out a lot about Andy's friend's back in Arizona.. one's even going to jail.. i think i need to introduce him to some of my friends to get the feel of Muscatine "teenagers" and stuff.. well... maybe i should choose carefully about who i introduce him to.. like Kaitei.. i love her to death and everything but i don't want him around the stuff she does.. i've found out that he even smokes.. or he's at least done it before and i don't think he'll think twice about doing it again.. :S this kid worries me.. i don't want him to end up with the Latin Kings or in some other gang... or even getting drunk constantly and doing drugs and getting some girl pregnant.. well.. i think i've talked enough.. i need to go rule my own world and not have a life.. bye

      There once was an Indian whose given name was "Onestone," so named because he had only one testicle.   He hated that name and asked everyone to not to call him Onestone!   After years and years of torment, Onestone finally cracked and said, "If anyone calls me Onestone again I will kill them!"   The word got around and nobody called him that any more.   Then one day a young girl named Blue Bird forgot and said, "Good morning, Onestone..."   He jumped up, grabbed her, and took her deep into the forest where he made love to her all day and all night.   He made love to her all the next day, until Blue Bird died from exhaustion.   The word got around that Onestone meant serious business.   Years went by and no one dared call him by his given name until a woman named Yellow Bird returned to the village after being away for many years.   Yellow Bird, who was Blue Bird's cousin, was overjoyed when she saw Onestone.   She hugged him and said, "Good to see you, Onestone..."   Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest, then he made love to her all day and all night; made love to her all the next day and night...but, Yellow Bird wouldn't die!!!!   What is the moral of this story???   You can't kill two birds with one stone!
