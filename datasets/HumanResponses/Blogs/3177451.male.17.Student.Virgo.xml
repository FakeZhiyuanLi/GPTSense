      I'm in a pretty good mood today. I'm looking forward to the puppets trip this weekend, and just enjoying ignoring my homework. lol.   I watched the teaser for a movie, Garden State, that comes out July 30th. It looks so good, the cinematography, the sharpness and clearness of the picture, it's beautiful. can't wait till it comes out, and it has a good plot too.^_^

      ugh, today sucked. I wanted to go home all day. On the bus I decided i was going to go get the bike out of the closet and just ride it around for a while...but the key wasn't on the hook in the kitchen so i couldn't. Oh well, maybe tomorrow. Nothing too interesting today happened. Just wish I didn't have to go back tomorrow... :-/

      The trip was great, we all had a blast. I think the most fun part was Denny's at 12:30-2:40 in the morning when we were eating, lol. Didn't get much sleep because Pete snores so much, heh, but it was alright cause it wasn't too long before we would wake up. It was fun and i can't wait to do it again at IFEST.

      Today was the official last day of school. While there are still exams tomorrow, Monday, and Tuesday, not everyone will be there for them. I got a little down about this in 6th period when I realized that this would be the last time I would see some of my friends from Dunedin. Ugh, I'm such a dork too, I had my sketchbook and could have asked people to sign it, but I forgot. So now I don't have my friends' signatures or anything to remember them by, except for Chris's which I remembered to ask him for in 6th period. It was kinda sad cause he wrote that he will see me when the next school year starts, but unfortunately, he forgot I'm going to CHS next year and didn't realize that that wont happen. -_-

      Yesterday I went to my friend Kyle's graduation at the Bayfront Center. It was the PHUHS graduation so i got to see a bunch of old friends step up on stage and recieve their diplomas. Among them was my old friend Kristine, it looked so odd to see her standing up there, accepting the diploma and walking off, and the thought "wow, she's an alumni now" crossed my mind. Kyle as well was strange to see up there, though i felt more disbelief than surprise that he would ever become an adult, hehe.   After graduation ceremonies, we went to Arrigato's. The food was so good! I took lots of pictures too, some really funny ones. The waitresses there actually wore kimonos, it was so cool, and our chef was an old Japanese man and he was really funny. He did the volcano with the onions and flipped around bowls and such and made good jokes, it was a blast.

      YAY!!! I just got back from one of the awesomest trips I've ever been on. I went with my puppet ministry group to Kankakee, Illinois to the International Festival of Puppetry and Ventrilliquism (sp) or "I-FEST" for short. It was a blast, we learned so much and were all really inspired to continue furthuring our ministry and spreading the word. I got so many good ideas for props in the skits and really developed a desire to want to do puppets myself. I also want to learn to do live puppetry and create my own character with all sorts of manorisms and life in its own. I think with time, this could be something really awesome, and I'll be praying for it.   God Bless, Nick

      I saw King Arthur today, not a bad movie, a little far fetched, but it was good. Really liked some of the tattoos and face painting on some of the warriors, might see patterns like this later in some of my sketches.  I get inspiration from many things...hehe.

      Currently working on a few things, one of which is a concept for "simple harmonics", a replacement for "dive into dreams". The other of which is a new painting, more news on that soon.

      I've been working with a man from my church installing window blinds in a new building not far from here. So i've been having to get up earlier than normal the last few days. It's not so bad if I get enough rest the night before, but the first day I got 4 hours cause i couldn't sleep. Hehe, my usual bed time is 5:30 AM, so when i tried to go to bed any earlier than that i couldn't. I ended up watching My Neighbor Totoro at 3 in the morning, lol (such a good movie though ^_____^).  The work itself is kinda boring, and Pete keeps telling the corniest jokes, but i guess it's not so bad. It's my first actual job in 3 years and i'm just happy to have it.  More info on the new project "simple harmonics": The concept of the site is going to be harmonizing music, design, and art to make a good impression on the viewer. As is my current site, this one will be extremely simple, very easy to navigate interface, and hopefully even more content than it's predecessor.  Though I am quite happy that i've finally filled up a good 70% of my site this summer.  I also am working on a painting which i just started last night. Expect to see that uploaded in the next week or so.  Keep on visiting and i'll keep on updating, with hope I can get all of my plans accomplished this year.

      Tonight my mom and I went shopping for cars. We found this one car that i practically fell in love with, and we might get it in the next three days. I want to tell people what it is, but I'd rather surprise them in person XD.   After the car shopping, my mom and I went to Ruby Tuesdays and I drank 4 hand mixed cherry cokes lol. When we finished, my mom dropped me off at a bowling alley so i could meet with the gang and play a few, but unfortunately due to strict parents and curfew, it ended after the first game, lol. 9 people playing tends to take up a good amount of time though, even with 2 lanes, so the game did last worth the time in going.   Tomorrow school starts, I'm excited, but I think the car thing is overpowering the school excitedness, so I don't really think too much of it right now.  In any case, tomorrow's going to be interesting for sure ^___^

      Well, today's the last day before school starts. I'll be going to countryside high school this year again, and i'll be taking lots of fun classes, w00t!  Miss all my Dunedin buddies, Becky, Kristyn, Chris, Jeremy, and even more all of the guys who graduated last year that i used to hang out with in programming class!!!  I'm sure i'll have a blast a CHS though since Aaron, Andi, Ted, Beave, Emily, and all the other crazy people there!  Good luck to everyone this year, try not to work too hard or slack off too much!
