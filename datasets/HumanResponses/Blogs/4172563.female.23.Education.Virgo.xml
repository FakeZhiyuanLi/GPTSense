      Today is my monthsary with my boyfriend bri.  We have been together for 6 years and 11 months.  Its such a long time already huh!? When people ask me how long we have been together, they are so surprised.  Those who know us often ask when will we get married.  I do like o get married already.  Sad to say, he isn’t.  I am actually willing to wait but the question is how long is too long?!   I am a girl who has often thought of getting married.  I remember as a young girl my sister and I would talk of what kind of boyfriend we would have.  Now I keep my thoughts of getting married.  It has been like a mantra in my heart.  The yearning has grown over the years that I can’t suppress it anymore.  I understand the reasons he has for opting not to settle down yet.  At first he would tell me we had to earn first.  He always reasoned “finances”.  I took it to heart, and for the past year until the present I am so into earning.  I don’t spend too much on things unneeded.  I try to prioritize stuff that I buy and always set aside money for my savings.  Today, when I ask him about his finances he would tell me that I focus too much on money.  It was actually him who taught me how to care about money.  Before, I earned money because I want to buy stuff that I want; now money is like something that rules me because of my desire to settle down.  In a roundabout way, I do know he isn’t ready for marriage.  I know that he is at times immature.  There are times when we would fight about the way he dresses.  I do try not to mind the way he dresses but at times it can be too much.  During parties (esp. if its formal and with my friends), I actually have to drag him and we have to fight over what he would wear.  He would opt to wear a t-shirt saying that he doesn’t want to conform.  He always says that men are the ones who made rules.  I just tell him that out of respect to the people who invited you, do try to dress properly.  Oh…. I don’t know what to do.    I still wonder, why do I want to marry such a guy?  He doesn’t seem to be interested with my friends who are also an important part of my life.  He doesn’t seem to share my views at times.  I guess it boils down to love.  He has made me dream and has given me one of the things that I have always wished for.  He is someone I can rely on.  He is my best friend, my best enemy, my constant companion and the dearest person who has touched my heart.  I will wait for now… though I cannot say how long.  Waiting can be so hard when you know that time is of essence.

      Today, I woke up feeling tired even after a good night's rest. I went to work feeling and thinking of nothing.  I even did some of my tasks without putting any thought into it.  It simply felt like a routine.  As I was leading my students in prayer, I forgot a part of the prayer (we skipped it!) and I realized that my mind felt like it wasn't working.  It was as if it was just there up in the clouds.   Anyway, I felt excited inside.  It's Friday, and tomorrow there isn't supposed to be any classes.  We have class but it will only be the examination of some preparatory students.  I am only to teach two class today, then I have the rest of the time to myself...  I had my nails done, it was simply relaxing.  My back is craving for a massage, maybe I will try to get some later on this weekend or next (I always say that!).  Anyway, I was able to walk around the mall and it simply made me feel alive again!  It simply makes you wonder what is relaxing about going to the mall.  I think that when I get to the mall, it simply gives me time to think of other things instead of things that I have to do or what I am responsible for.  I am a shopaholic at heart! I admit it.  I feel that I really love fashion... if I am given a chance, I would pursue a career in it.  I love everything... accessories, clothes, shoes.... But i do have to control my urge to buy so as not to bury myself in debt.  I rationalize and invest in key pieces, I take time to make my choice and prioritize the things I want and need.  You know what!? I have a list of stuff I want in a notebook.  I just wrote it while I was doodling at work.  It just felt good to write it and yet I am overwhelmed by the number of items I want.  What the heck!?  Dreaming, thinking, wishing is just for free... who is there to limit me???

      Today, I woke up feeling great, rested....  As I checked my cellphone for any messages, I got one that really made me sad.  It realy put me in a bad mood.  I lost my appetite and simply got depressed, feeling bad and all...  Anyway, I went to work and did my best to hide what I felt inside.  Being with my students made me forget some of my personal problems.   Now, I actually don't feel so sad.  I just know that things will work out no matter what.  ;)

      I am very happy today.  I feel lighter, cheerier...  I am simply awaiting for the work day to be over so that it is officially the weekend for me! yahoo! I want to relax, to lounge around, go to the mall and to simply unwind.  Don't you just love fridays?  I love it!   It may have been a hectic week at work.  Really tiring, handling so much kids as a teacher can really drain you.  I am actually losing my voice once again (which seems to happen almost every week).  Teaching may be challenging but I just enjoy it.  I may dread going to work every Monday or each morning I wake up but whenever I see the kids, you just can't help it but to enjoy the time you have with them.  As a teacher, its a really amazing feeling knowing that these kids look up to you.  Whatever you tell them is something that is correct and they will carry on until they get home.  If you ask me to cite experiences I have in the classroom, I may never stop and I am sure that you may end up laughing at some of my experiences.  It really fun being with kids but seeing it as work makes it stressful.  ;)  Anyway, even if I still have other jobs i have on the side to do during the weekend, i simply look forward to having some time for myself.  Happy weekend!

      I have a group of friends who I have known since elementary.  I actually find it quite awesome how our group came about.  It was actually a gradual process from being classmates to seeing each other in our various organizations.  Our casual familiarity blossomed into a special bond of friendship.  Oftentimes, my friends and I get together once in awhile.  We usually go out whenever there is a special occasion.  As time went, seeing each other came less.  Each of us has our own careers, relationships, things that we do on our own lives. Nevertheless, we try to find time to spend together.   Our special friendship has brought us together such that even if we are not able to see each other we are still able to keep our closeness alive.  As years went by, we find ourselves at crossroads, challenges… I feel that we may be apart but our thoughts and memories of the special friendship we share is always alive.  Like moths to a flame, whenever we get together, we kindle the fire of our friendship; we cherish it so that although we are apart we are still able to keep our closeness alive.  Special friends are truly hard to get by; nurturing it to keep it thriving is essential.  For the friendship such as ours have grown knowing that each one has something unique to offer to one another.  We love each others’ quirks and laugh together at our mistakes.  Truly, this friendship should be kept on…  a toast to special friends who inspite of distance and challenges still goes on!  Let not goodbye be goodbye but let it be see you soon, for the fondness in each others hearts will surely keep each going until the next moment that you see each other again.
