      Jack Leo Iker: Coward among bishops...  Jack Leo Iker is my bishop.  I am a parisioner in the diocese of Fort Worth Texas.  As a member of the group known as Fort Worth Via Media, I was "in on" sending a letter of concern to Bishop Iker, who is a member of the American Anglican Council.    While many of us were not expecting any response, I expected the response to have answers if it was ever sent.  Bishop Iker sent a response, and the response, the whole paragraph of it, was nothing but him playing with words, and answering no questions.  I was shocked he even replied, and disappointed that the man couldn't even have the courtesy of answering straight-forwardly the questions asked of him.  After that response, a friend of mine in the diocese of For Worth wrote him a letter.  The letter spoke about authority of scripture, Bishop Gene Robinson and his consecration, and the issue of divorce.  The jist was "Bishop Iker, if you are so in favor of the authority of scripture why is it that you condemn the consecration of an openly gay man to the episcopate, based on scriptural underandings, and have no real problem with divorce which Christ Himself spoke against?"    Bishop Iker wrote back.  The sentence reply was nothing short or more than: "I am growing weary of your constant prodding.  Please put your time to better use. +JLI"  The arrogance, and utter causticness of his reply makes my stomach turn.  The man could not answer a simple question.  The man, who is supposed to have a form of pastoral authority, showed no pastoral care or concern what-so-ever.    "Dear God! Dear God!  Why have you forsaken me?" is what I want to scream aloud - but I all I must remember is that Christ told us that we would suffer as His servants.  Although I am not suffering like so many other Christians - I am still suffering injustice.  I cannot even recieve attiquite pastoral care for it honest and simple questions are seen as "prodding."

       Federal Marriage Amendment   Not this Time!   The conservative group in the United States tried to pass an amendment today that would ban gay marriage in the United States constitution.  As a Christian, and as a humanist-American I must say that the idea makes me sick.  To have people who stand upon their soap boxed preaching at me being so close to making their sermon a matter of law.  It's quite scary.    Today they didn't win.  They got close, but not close enough.  As of now I am not legally bound definitely by the U.S. constitution from being married as others are.  I thank God.  Through these times of trial, I have kept strong in my faith and kept my spirit up through the Blessed Sacrament, and in knowing that Jesus is watching the sparrow, so surely I know he watches me.  As the old spiritual goes: "Why should I feel discouraged?  Why should the shadows come?  Why should my heart feel lonely, and long for heaven and home?  When Jesus is my portion, a constant friend is He.  He's eye is on the sparrow and I know He watches over me."   Every time I get down, or discouraged I must remember that if God be for me, then who can be against me?  In these trials I ask that all of you pray for me, as well as for our enemies - that they might fully know and understand the gospel of Our Savior, Jesus Christ.

       No Voice in Fort Worth   Robby D. - Diocese of Fort Worth   Here in Fort Worth, gay and liberal Episcopalians seem to have no voice what-so-ever.  Our Bishop, Jack Leo Iker, seems to think that he can put his hand over our mouths with inequality, and injustice.  Within the Church, we are even subjected to letters of "pastoral concerns" we are subjected to letters from our Bishop which defile not only the GLBT community, but ourselves for being supporters, or members of the community.    Where is the compassion of our bishop?  Where is the pastoral care that we are all so desperatly calling for?  Crying for?  Why is my bishop more concerned with my sexuality than my vocation to serve God within God's Church?  Why is my priest more willing to follow the wickedness of a earthly figure that he is supposed to be "submissive" to than to listen to the truth of his heart in loving people for who God has created them?  Why?  As a seventeen year old I scream out "why?"    Am I so immature that I cannot grasp the ideals or priorities of adults?  Am I so young that I do not matter in the eyes of my bishop, or my priest?  Am I so "immoral" that they would rather turn their back on me than show me the love of Christ?   I see excuse after excuse from my diocese and the "Network" - I see no Christ-like action being taken.  I am a voiceless child in a diocese that hates me.  I have been called to do bigger, and better things with my life - and thanks be unto God.  This is:  Robby's Heart   Under God's Mercy, Robby D.

      True Anglicanism: Via Media  This past weekend, on July 31st, Fort Worth had its first Integrity meeting in years.  In this conservative diocese it is a relief to find an inclusive group of Episcopalians who share the same concerns, and thoughts that I do.  The group is a group of people of all walks - some are gay, some are straight.    At this meeting the Reverend Susan Russell, the president of Integrity USA came for a visit. This was my first time ever meeting, or even seeing a female priest outside of photographs and television.  It was the first Eucharist I celebrated with a female priest, who just so happens to also be a lesbian.  I was so touched by her message, and her beautiful voice.    I actually got to see first-hand what the Episcopal Church USA (ECUSA) has to offer me, as a gay Christian.  In this diocese I don't get to see the true inclusivity of the Church - supported by the Bishop and clergy.  At this meeting, and by Susan's beautiful approach to spirituality within the Episcopal Church I can really say I have seen the true message of the Inclusive Church, which is Christ's body.  I can truely say "I am an Episcopalian."  I can truely say that I know what inclusivity is.  I experienced it for the first time.  There were tears.  There was laughter.  There was a few "Amens" shouted even.  I truely felt the power of the Holy Spirit as strong as I have ever felt It before in the Episcopal Church.  At the Mass that Susan celebrated with Integrity.  At the Mass that we celebrated at Trinity Episcopal Church the next morning.  I was so moved by the Power of God Almighty that I can truely say "I know this is where I belong."  And I can shout from the highest roof-top "Jack it ain't your Church it's God's Church!"  I can truely say I experienced the spirit of Christ all around me, within me, and coming from me... And it is a beuatiful thing to be able to say.  It's a beautiful thing to be able to stand strong in Christ and know that through Him all things are possible - all things are possible through God, who is love!  I've learned more about myself, and about what I can achieve in this life... evangelism, a romance filled with Godly love and compassion, and through both I can truely feel the presance of the Holy Spirit that I have felt and hope to continue to feel working in the true Episcopal Church - the Church that embraces inclusivity, and the via media... the middle way.  Alleluia - and Glory to God in the Highest!   Under God's Mercy, I remain, Robby D.  Diocese of Fort Worth, TX
