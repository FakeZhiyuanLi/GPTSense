        A GIRLY-GIRL. You dont have a lot of self-esteem and people are always bringing you down for being sad. What do they know, anyway? You feel like youre too mature for your age and are frustrated by the trend-followers who refuse to accept you because youre not like them.  Your virtues: Intelligence, understanding nature, modesty.  Your flaws: Lack of social life, inferiority complex, timidity..    You might like this game, but maybe it's not your thing.  Take a look anyway if you are curious:  www.life-blood.vze.com    urlLink   What kind of girl are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      What is the point of blogs? They are supposed to be interesting, right? And in order for that, you have to have an interesting life- or have creative/interesting thoughts. Because people only read them if they are interesting. In that case, no one is probably reading mine. I mean, how is  my  life  interesting ? The only things I do are go to driving school, watch TV, laze around the house and occasionally go see movies or shop. But so does, like, half of the US.  Some people have such cool and interesting lives. Like I was reading a blog of a girl who is trying to make it in the music business. And I read the author  urlLink Sarah Dessen's livejournal .(my fav author- you should read her books) But of course hers is good because she writes for a living! Well, I think I'll go laze around some more.  Listening to- "Memory" by Sugarcult

      my power went out for like 3 1/2 hours today! damn wind! thankfully it came back on! :) anyway... driving school is the most boring thing ever. I can feel my eyelids slowly closing in the middle of class! Yuck- I hate hearing the idea of having a class during summer! Its only 3 hours but still....  yesterday i went shopping and got the cutest pair of  urlLink bright green cropped pants  and a blue halter from Gap. I just love that store sometimes!   listening to- "a favor house atlantic" by Coheed and Cambria

      Hey! This is my first post.  Happy July 4th!  I am using this post as a chance to describe my blog. I know it is called OC Fanatic at the moment, but I will probably change it. My life isn't all about  urlLink The OC - just 75% of my life is. Just kidding. But I do love the show- and especially  urlLink Ben Mckenzie . Anyway, enough about The OC.  Let's see....about me....I live in Maryland and have a twin sister. I have a dog that is a Westie. I play piano and love fashion. And that's basically it.   ON Friday I saw Fahrenheit 9/11. I cried during some of it. Like, the part where they just played the sounds of people and ambulances during September 11. After seeing the movie, you will basically hate Bush and his administration. Yeah, I know it is a biased documentary, but the republicans really have nothing for a rebuttal.
