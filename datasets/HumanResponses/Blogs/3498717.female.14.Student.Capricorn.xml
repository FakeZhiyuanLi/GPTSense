      I woke up and talked to Kelly on the net and asked her if she was going to the party and she said no cuz her sister had games all day but she called her mom and asked if my mom could come and pick her up and she said yes! So we went to go pick her up and once we got to the civic center it was locked and we didnt have a key. So we went to Moores store and asked for the key and told them we were renting it tonight and he just gave it to us and didnt even asked if we already paided for it! haha (Which we did).. Lol. So once we got there me and kelly moved everything how we liked it and waited for jessie and kris to get there. We set up everything and jessie did a FABulous job getting the decorations! Everyone started coming and it was burning up inside cuz they had the air conditioner thing locked up so everyone was outside.. and me and jessie thought it got off to a bad start but everyone really had fun and it got waay better towards the end! Matt was the dj most of the night and he seemed to enjoy it alot haha! After everyone left we set everything back how it was and we left! Me and my mom went to go get some ice cream afterwards and then we went back home. Thats all.. so see ya!

      Went to school.. I didnt make the graybook celebration OR the ar celebration! HaHa, well us ppl who didnt make tha graybook thing went to mrs. LASTERS class!! Me and "TJ" went to help Ms. Jordan to change her file things.  She gave us Twizzlers for helping her. Yum Yum.  So we went back to Mrs. Laster's class and Ms. Gladwell came in and Anisa asked her if some of us could go to tanagrams so Mrs. Laster picked ppl and I wasn't one of them so I just got up and left. HeHeHe. Then after that we went back to her class and Jordan Wilson was outside and he was hilarious! He would come in there and like sneak around and get her all mad it was really funny!! Then we went back to homeroom with all the ppl who didn't make the ar celebration and who was still waiting to go. I was talking to Jen Hill and Ms Myers was walking towards us and Braden got on the counter and his pants fell down! Jen Hill and Ms Myers were the only ones i think that saw! (Thank Goodness i didnt see it :P) We had to do social studies worksheets but i wasnt about to do them :P hehe.. we went to lunch .. (Me, Jen Hill, LeAnna, Braden, Randy and Brian)
