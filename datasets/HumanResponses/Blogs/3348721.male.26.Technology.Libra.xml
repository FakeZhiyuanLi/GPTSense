      i don't why i was thinking about her but i was reminded of her while shopping the other day.. other people from the rainham area may even remember her.  From an early age, i always used to see this old lady on her bike in Rainham shopping centre, she was never without her shopping from either tesco or Co-op and never far away from her trusty push-bike. she was always smiling and looking eager to get home once she had collected all the groceries she needed. These were piled high in her basket and occasionally fastened behind the back seat (although i had seen her walking up a hill pushing the bike due to the weight of her load). no, of course this doesn't seem that strange. It was only as i got older and had a job during the summer of '94 did i realise that she pretty much seemed to do this every day. Ashamed to say it, i remember seeing her in tesco once and watching to see what she bought. she mainly seemed to stick to the sale items and other items that maybe used for ingredients in cakes and biscuits. I imagined that every night was spent cooking with all these ingredients to make said snacks for her large family made up of grandchildren, nephews and nieces, a woman surely indulging in the old-aged traditions of old age.. The way she use to use cirlce round the precinct on her bike without seeming to notice how fast she was going (she'd just ring the bell and smile if she thought she was within a whisker of you)was like a scene from one of the (in)famous naked gun films. people seemed oblivous to it though, but then it was an every day occurence..  Sadly, on my few visits back to rainham, i no longer see her (the mouth-organ player is still there on a saturday). I guess she was about 70 when i used to see her which would make her 80 now so maybe the bike is no longer an option. I like to think that someone has shown her how to use the internet and she is now getting her shopping delivered every day with a similar urgency.    i finally got my fixed 303 back from the shop today.. it's only been 3 bloody months. the guy made attempts at apologies but didn't seem to know what to say. He knew they had fucked up basically and so did i. Probably very wise as it meant that there was need for me to complain too much.. It is a handy shop and i've used it frequently in the past although extra caution maybe used in future. so i now have another machine that makes a lot of silly noises, i've now just got to learn how to use them properly rather than randomly.

      i haven't stopped.. really big overstated yawns too and i thought i got a good nights sleep.  I went to Bromley south shopping centre today at lunch and who else but Jordan was signing her (much hyped??) autobiography... the place was full of the kind of people that really should never be allowed to congregate in such abundance.. i felt scared. I didn't actually see her but there were lots of people taking photo's and shouting her name(s). There was a real mixture of people there, obviously lots young men and boys but also a lot of young, scantily clad Jordan lookalike girls too. Are they looking on her to be a role-model with her story of how lots of people have manipulated her over the last 5 years???  still, she's bloody rich for it... Though i do wonder how her back will be in 10 years though.

      Today i was in Wembley working in a tall office block. I had great view of London. A lovely yellow fog was gently touching the tops of the tallest towers for the best part of the day. The new wembley stadium looks like a giant Asda, that's all i could say when i saw it. "it's just another bloody Asda building". why they couldn't knock down the arena as well is beyond me, But then i suppose they use it for ice hockey as well as shit gigs. I'd forgotten how grim it is up there. Again, it's another place i get to work in where there is nothing to do at lunch so you might as well work through it. At least there wasn't so many chavvy type people about which is what i've been used to. The people in Wembley just look genuinely put out and hard done by. The Sad thing about my excursion today was that i decided it was best to go into Kings Cross first, which was way off course but i assumed this would be the only place i would get a decent, large coffee before work. I'm proud to say i was right. I also got home in record time tonight which was another nice little bonus to the day.  I bought the new  urlLink Morrisey  album yesterday. It's good! the first few songs, i felt were growers but the Moz of old seems to kick in when it gets to 'the world is full of crashing bores'. 'how can anyone...', 'first of the gang to die' and 'i like you' are typical anthemic Morrisey tunes. I wont harp on about it as i'm sure this Album wont appeal to a lot of people but i recommend it to anyone who has dabbled in the black arts of 'Mozza' before.  I've had to hide the Shins new album as it's in danger of being overplayed and it would be such a shame for this to happen. i'm gonna try and give it a couple of months now.  Someone informed me today that Keane had got to number 1 in the album charts. Can someone please bloody explain how this happened? i read in an NME recently that they considered  urlLink 'Aphex twin'  to be a big influence on the act.. huh? who tells them to say this shit?? another band in a long line that spurt on about influential artists that they blatantly have nothing in common with. Is anyone safe from the oily brush of PR? Probably not.   i've promised myself that i'm going to do some music tonight, the 'new' band is now making a lot of progress and i'm hoping we'll have at least 3 songs for people to chin stroke, ponder and slowly shake their heads at very soon.  I finally got round to seeing Donnie Darko too on Sunday albeit on a poorly lit laptop and the sound wasn't that hot either. Shame really as it was a good film. Not as great as I was told it would be but their were some nice touches, fairly easy to take in, interesting plot but i wasn't left with anything to think about at the end of the film which i think that's what it wanted (it *was* one of those films, wasn't it?) but at least there was no shit A.I or other form of drawn out Hollywood ending which i feared may happen.   ok, enough of this for now. Things need to be done.

      hmmm, my first blog and not much too say. It's saturday which is a good thing. We are going to iroha in Hendon this afternoon. We haven't been in there for over a year now. They gave us truffles as a Christmas present last time, probably something to do with the ridiculous amount of money we used to spend in there.. Mmmmm but their Protein buzzes were so good!  I'm meeting martin afterwards. haven't seen him since the furries gig so it will be nice to have a chat and a beverage or two. it's so good not to be at work today!

      i was in Medway hosipital the other day visiting my Dad (he's ok now) and my Mum asked me - 'who was that Teacher at primary school who really hated you?' - 'Miss Finn' i replied..  about 15 minutes later i went to the coffee shop in the reception area and who serves me my coffee? yep, Miss Finn! i hadn't seen her in 15 years but her name badge confirmed who she was. She's retired now and does voluntary work and she was incredibly surprised and delighted to see me (it might have been the purple hair). I was incredibly polite and nice as i always was to her (even though she hated me - i used to answer her back but not in a rude way. it was more of a bemused, inquisitive way) and i think she quite enjoyed the chance meeting. still, it was a strange coincidence but strangely things like this no longer freak me out.. coincidences like this are bound to happen occasionally. the burning question on whether she was still having an affair with Mr Evans (it'd been going 20 years or so) remained unanswered.. But he obviously never made an honest woman of her though :(
