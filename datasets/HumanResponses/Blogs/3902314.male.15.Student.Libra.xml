      July 19th, 2004  [11:52 PM]  &nbsp;  I, Robot/**1/2  &nbsp;  "Set in a future Earth (2035 A.D.) where robots are common assistants and workers for their human owners, this is the story of "robotophobic" Chicago Police Detective Del Spooner's (Smith) investigation into the murder of Dr. Miles Hogenmiller, who works at U.S. Robotics (run by Greenwood), in which a robot, Sonny (Tudyk), appears to be implicated, even though that would mean the robot had violated the Laws of Robotics, which is apparently impossible. It seems impossible because.. if robots can break those laws, there's nothing to stop them from taking over the world, as humans have grown to become completely dependent upon their robots. Or maybe... they already have? Aiding Spooner in his investigation is a psychologist, Dr. Susan Calvin (Moynahan), who specializes in the psyches of robots..."  &nbsp;  Predictable, yet thought provoking to say the least.&nbsp;I, Robot is a typical summer blockbuster which exceeds normal standards through a&nbsp;sophisticated plot.&nbsp; Instead of common non-stop action and violence, the movie's pace is slower and relaxed. This&nbsp;gives the&nbsp;audience time to take in&nbsp;key events and story points.&nbsp;The flick's dialogue&nbsp;and events are routine&nbsp;and common among&nbsp;summer movies,&nbsp;yet,&nbsp;most of the action and commotion ties into the desired storyline effect. This makes for a more rational,&nbsp;audience pleasing&nbsp;movie.&nbsp; The&nbsp;movie also&nbsp;ties in the emotions and feelings of the robots instead of making them immediate villains.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it&nbsp;makes the robots more understandable.&nbsp;Viewers have the ability to connect and&nbsp;actually&nbsp;feel sympathy for the non-human characters.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  A certain&nbsp;consideration&nbsp;must be given to the creators of this movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common among large scale productions like I, Robot to fall&nbsp;away from the original&nbsp;storyline (Minority Report, Bladerunner, Robocop, A.I)&nbsp; yet, the makers&nbsp;stayed true to the foundation&nbsp;and&nbsp;novel by Isaac Asimov.  &nbsp;  Rated PG-13 for intense stylized action, and some brief partial nudity.  &nbsp;

      July 13th, 2004 [1:24 PM]  Spirited Away/***1/2  "Chihiro and her family are on their way to their new house in the suburbs when her father decides to take a shortcut along a lonely- looking dirt road. After getting out of the car and walking along a path for a while, they discover an open-air restaurant filled with food but with no workers or customers present. Mom and Dad don't hesitate to sit down and dig in, but Chihiro senses danger and refuses. As night falls, she is terrified to see the area fill with faceless spirits, but when she runs to find her parents, she discovers that they have been turned into pigs. She is found by a mysterious boy named Haku, who promises to help her. He gets her a job working in a nearby building, which turns out to be a spa hotel for the thousands of Japan's gods and spirits. Though the work is hard and the people strange, she does as well as she can. Her parents, however, are still waiting in the hotel's stockyard, and Chihiro must find a way to break the spell on them before they end up as the main course of some guest's dinner."  Visually stunning movie. Groundbreaking cintematic animation which will leave viewers breathless. However, this movie had a few minor problems found in the plot. When watching a film, viewers should connect with the characters and story.  This component was lacking throughout "Spirited Away."  Frequently during the extent of this movie, I felt that many scenes were made precisely to add beauty and appeal.  This made it increasingly hard to understand the characters and storyline. Nevertheless, good visual watch for adults and children alike.  Rated PG for some scary moments. Runtime: 125 min

      July 12th, 2004 [10:26 PM]  Anchorman/**1/2  "Ron Burgundy (Ferrell) is the top-rated anchorman in San Diego in the '70s. When feminism marches into the newsroom in the form of ambitious newswoman Veronica Corningstone (Applegate), Ron is willing to play along at first-as long as Veronica stays in her place, covering cat fashion shows, cooking, and other "female" interests. But when Veronica refuses to settle for being eye candy and steps behind the news desk, it's more than a battle between two perfectly coiffed anchor-persons... it's war."  Interesting premise, yet there were many flaws in this movie which ruined the desired effect. As a fan of Will Ferell I agreed to see this movie with very high hopes. Sadly, I was thoroughly dissapointed with the entire production.  I believe that the main reason for my dislike was the supporting cast.  The jokes told by the cast members were either hit or miss.  Too many times during the film were there awkward silences in the theater after the various buffoonery. Average film.  Rated PG-13 for sexual humor, language and comic violence. Runtime: USA:91 min
