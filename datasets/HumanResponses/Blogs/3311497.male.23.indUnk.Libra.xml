      Okay so today I have a phone interview with the Royal Bank. It is at 11am so no phone calls please.  The only thing wierd about this is that it is for a non-descript job. That means it is a general interview. Jess had one of these but it was all geared towards Royal Direct, which is pure sales, and I'm not about to do that.  I didnt' get a college degree in Human Resources to go out and be a salesman. The only position I'm interested in is a Personal Financial Rep, which does do sales but it is more like recommendations to clients on certain products. Either way just to get my foot in the door would be great.    Today is hectic after the interview. I need to pack my bag for the cottage and get on the train for 4pm. I'm packing alot of stuff, but the main thing is going to be a big yellow tube for the boat. It's going to be kickass. I'm glad everyone is coming up to the cottage, even though some are only staying for one day.    I'm trying to upload pics but Blogger is all screwed up, so it's not so cool right now

      Well since I'm back home and all the fun stuff happens when Doug and I are left alone, I decided to start doing entries again.  Doug is so lazy. He went out and bought an 8 hundred dollar dryer that broke in 2 weeks of use. But that isn't the funny part. The funny part is that it has been sitting in our hallway for over 2 months now, and the reason you ask? Well he doesn't want to call Sears and get a repair guy down here because he doesn't know when he is going to be home.  Just to let everyone know, Doug is retired and the farthest he goes is down the street to bug the neighbours. As if during the past 2 months there wasn't 2 full days or possible a whole week where Doug didn't even leave the house for more then 20 minutes.  Many to have his procrastination skills.    BTW this blogger stuff got all re-done and now I can upload files. How cool is that?

      Well today is Friday, woowee. Going to work this weekend and then hitting the beach on Sunday with jessie.  I wish I didn't have to work b/c my cousin has vip passes to wakestock all wknd long. Man I wish I could go.  But working is needed plus I don't even have a car. Good old Dougy is supposed to be fixing it but says he is a busy man and has lots of things todo. Well I see golfing is a priority!!!!  I go in a find out what fulltime shift I'm working I can't wait.  Jessica is kinda upset b/c she won't be able to see me much while I'm working at Sobey's but she has to understand it is something I have to do now. I need to cash more then I need to see her at the moment. Beside she always whines about not getting to see, but I always made time and have seen her at least once a week since we started dating. Man women are possesive...

      So tomorrow I head back into work for good old Sobey's. Well it's going to be fun. The only good thing about it is we start our new hours, which is 3pm to 11pm. The bad thing is I'm going to find out my new shift. Since I'm going full-time I'm not sure what it will be. I hope it is Reach afternoon's which will be thursday to monday. Crap ass weekends, but I need the cash badly. It will be a quick way to drop down my LOC while I can still have the mornings and Tuesday Wednesday to look for a job. My goal is $5000.00 by the end of October.  Another thing is, I need to upgrade my computer really soon.  I'm looking over some of the enw stuff I want and I could easily get a crazy fast comp for under $1200.oo. One thing i want to do is get a linux machine up and running jsut for files and stuff. We will see.

      Okay so I went and saw the village last night. I will admit I didn't come close to Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, but I believe it was more like Signs then the others. Overall it was a freaky movie with M. Night Shamalan doing great cinematography and directing. The ending could have been done better but it was a suspensfull all the way through. I would for sure buy it when it comes out.  I found a job ad in the milton paper. It is for a place called Guardian Inudstries, seems all good and the best thing about it is that the plant is located in Erin, Ontario.  It's close to Milton but far from the city which I love (no traffic at all). The second good thing about it is that my friend Dan's cousin I beleive is a VP at Guardian, so maybe that will help out. Just hoping it is the same Guardian.  So other then those two things today is going to be boring, I'm painting patio furniture to cover up some rust spots for Duncan, and then just going to chill till Jess comes home from work to drive me back to my place.

      Yup it was a great weekend. So much stuff I don't even want to start. But the drive home was great. No traffic what-so-ever.  Anyway, I'm sure I will upload some pics for everyone soon. Jus thave to get home to do that.  I'm going to see the Village tonight with Jessie, then she is driving me home. I'm starting to feel how horrible it is not to have a car anymore.  I can't do what I want when I want. But hey Doug took it out and broke it (with out my permission I might add) so he should get off his ass and get it fixed. He BTW still owes me new tires from christmas.  Well I'm off, but Joey what was this incident on Saturday night? For me the cottage was all good.
