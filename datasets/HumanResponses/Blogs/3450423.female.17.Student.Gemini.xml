      Cherished Friends  God must have know there would be,  Times we’d need a word of cheer, Someone to praise a triumph Or brush away a tear.  He must have known we’d need to share The joy of “little things” In order to appreciate The happiness life brings.  I think he knew our troubled hearts  Would sometimes throb with pain, At trials and misfourtunes, Or goals we can’t attain.  He knew we’d need the comfort Of an understanding heart To give us strength and courage To make a fresh, new start.  He knew we’d need companionship, Unselfish…lasting…true, And so god answered  The heart’s great need With Cherished Friends… like you!

      1st ung The Reason ng Hoobastank ang ganda ganda grabe di nakakasawang pikingan kya nga gasgas na ung cd hehehe...  I'm not a perfect person As many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear  I've found a resaon for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You [x4]  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you  basta its great!pakingan nyo sya hehehe and d other one na gusto ko luma nah sya revive lang po ata How Did You Know by Gary V. inlove ulit kyo e2 song 4 u hehhee    How Did You Know Gary V.  How Did You Know   I remember so well  The day that you came into my life  You asked for my name  You had the most beautiful smile    My life started to change  I'd wake up each day feeling alright  With you right by my side  Makes me feel things will work out just fine    How did you know  I needed someone like you in my life  That there's an empty space in my heart  You came at the right time in my life    I'll never forget  How you brought the sun to shine in my life  And took all the worries and fears that I had  I guess what I'm really trying to say  It's not everyday someone like you comes my way  No words can express how much  I love you.

      I still remember, since the day i saw you I told myself that the person I've been looking for is you You are my soulmate, you're my life And I want to spend the rest of my life with you But how can i reach you, you're too far from me I know you, you don't know me I missed you, but you don't miss me And I love you, but you don't love me Can this be happen that you & me will meet again, Can this be real that you & me will be together again Can this be true that you & me will fall in love with each other Or can this be a dream that will aver come true If you only knew that I want to see you If you only knew how I love you If you're only here with me You'll know how I'm so happy to see you The most special person in my heart That I always keep in my heart Even you don't know me, let me know you 'Coz that the way to be close to you I hope that time will come for you & me I never give up, I'll do anything for you Because life is worthless without you

                  Rest in Pieces   Look At Me, my depth pereption must be off again  Cause this hurts deeper than I thought it did  It has not healed with time  It just shot down my spine.  You look so beautiful tonight.  Remind me how you layed us down  And gently smiled, before you destroyed my life   Chorus: Would you find it in your heart? To make this go away  And let me rest in pieces(let me rest in pieces)  Would you find it in your heart? To make this go away  And let me rest in pieces(let me rest in pieces) pieces  Look at me, my depth Perception must be off again.  You got much closer than I thought you did  I’m in your reach  You held me in your hands   Chorus: (repeat 3 times to end) Would you find it in your heart? To make this go away  And let me rest in pieces(let me rest in pieces)  Would you find it in your heart? To make this go away  And let me rest in pieces.(let me rest in pieces) pieces

      I love the way you make me laugh, the way you make me smile,  The way you hold me close to you, and kiss me for a while  I love you the way you support me, even if you disagree,  You never turn your back on me, you’re always there for me   I love the way you look at me, it makes my knees weak, The love and the glow in your eyes, makes it hard for me to speak   I love the way you love how I am, how I shouldn’t loose a pound, I’m so lucky to have you, you’re the best guy around   I love the way your protective, it shows me that you care,  Without you around to protect me, life would be unfair   I love the way we can sit around, and not say a thing,  We have a special bond, who knows what the future will bring  I love the way we are different people, our likes are not the same, Some of the things that I like, you probably think is lame   I love the way you cheer me up, especially when I’m sad,  And even when we get in fights, we never stay mad   I love the way we fall asleep, holding each other tight,  With you being apart of my life, everything seams so right   I love the way you love me, and the love that we share, I know this love is true, and nothing can ever compare   I love the way we love each other, and the time we spend together, I never want to loose you, I want to love you forever.
